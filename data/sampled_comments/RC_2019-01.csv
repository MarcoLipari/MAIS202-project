"medicine","t5_2qhff","Sometimes - but I find that it's more a person to person issue than a service / specialty issue. Often if you just communicate like adults you can decide together what is actually best for the patient.

Also, I think patients get better care if I take them rather than the service that has made it clear they don't want them, even if I think the reasoning behind that decision on the specialist's part has more to do with their patient load than their clinical judgement.

A few specific scenarios I absolutely hate are the following:

1) Admitting every person over 70 who falls and breaks their hip; even if there are no medical problems I can manage. Sure, I'm happy to take an ortho patient if they have diabetes or hypertension the ortho resident doesn't feel comfortable handling; whatever. I'm talking truly isolated surgical problems, like a broken hip with nothing else going on; it just feels like I'm being taken advantage of. Also, I can rarely answer any of the questions the patient cares about, so I'm just going to have to page the surgical service a bunch to get those answers for my patient.

2) For some reason, our urology service thinks that our medicine residents are better at placing foleys than our nurses. Insisting that I attempt to place a foley when the nurses fail or meet more resistance than they are comfortable with or whatever is just idiocy. Counting med school and residency I've personally placed less than 10 foleys ever. There are nurses that probably place 20-30 in a week. If my nurse tells me they need a urology resident, I'm going to page the urology resident.

3) At least run your attempt to turf patients past your attending. So many times I've admitted someone because the surgical resident overnight said they weren't appropriate for a surgical floor and then we both get yelled at by a surgery attending in the AM, me for not providing the same care the surgical attending would have, and you for turfing a surgery patient.",1546300801

Reducing LE and prosecution powers or placing checks and balance will reduce their ability to convict the guilty in order to protect the innocent.  Some balance needs to be found.  I think that the current balance is too far towards damaging the rights of the innocent.  But it wouldn't be a good balance to require LE to get a warrant in order to say ""Boo!"" to you either.  Very few people support having power taken away from them that they feel helps in doing their job.  In this case that power is being abused by many, but not most and needs to be curtailed IMO.  

The Innocent Man the book was better than the documentary IMO.  It did more on pointing out systemic problems as well as some questionable actions of LE and prosecution.  I think that you make a valid point against the documentary, but I also think you are in part spoiled by MD and LR's work in MaM 1 &amp; 2 as are most of us. :-)",1546300803

In court cases like Wickard vs. Filburn and Gonzales_v._Raich, the supreme court has found the federal government has the power to regulate crop growth by private citizens, with no intent or practice of trading over state borders, because it may theoretically effect interstate commerce. Which to me is fucking insane. It gives the feds carte blanch to exercise powers over anything that could, in theory, effect interstate commerce. 

For those unfamiliar with this vary important case. From Wikipedia. 

""That argument stems from the landmark New Deal case Wickard v. Filburn, which held that the government may regulate personal cultivation and consumption of crops because of the aggregate effect of individual consumption on the government's legitimate statutory framework governing the interstate wheat market.""

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers 
   would adjust to these criteria.
   
  #Here: have a mod explain it to you in a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yAjpvb5oDg&amp;t=15s)
   
   In the meantime, make sure to familiarize yourself with our rules.

Pushing yourself to stay submerged below it as to not drift too close sends clusters of bubbles up towards its gaping maw coalescing into the open roof of its mouth, either the bubbles float deeper into its throat or attempt to squeeze through the gaps in its teeth, and just like you would if it erupted to life as you gaze at it in the cold, green murk, the bubbles break apart and float past its once live eyes.

Often, when friends distant themselves, usually it's because they're going through something that they need to figure out for theirselves. If you've done everything to ensure you were a good friend, then trust when I say it's enough and it probably doesn't have much to do with you. Unless you were a terrible friend who treated her badly, that definitely could've pushed her away. But according to your circumstances, it sounds like you're a patient and thoughtful individual who really just depended on her company and support. 

Also, if you consider yourself a good friend to her, you would support her and give her the space and time she needs to do whatever she needs. Take this time to be by yourself and be a good friend for her by letting her know the door is always open whenever she's ready to be close again. Friends don't need to always talk and be around each other 24/7 to have a wonderful relationship. Unless this is your significant other or someone you're dating, it'd be different.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","No, it is something he came up with himself. He received advises from NASA and the PR people, but in the end it was his decision to say what he said, and as far as we know he came up with it himself. In one regard he did receive a suggestion which was more or less an order: he was to avoid the topic of religion.

On Apollo-8 (first mission which orbited the moon) the mission commander, Frank Borman read the book of Genesis on live TV, and there was some fallout from it NASA didn't want to deal with again. That's why Armstrong was asked to avoid the topic of religion. Also for this reason it was unannounced and not shown on TV that Buzz Aldrin had wine and wafer with him, and had a private communion after the landing of the Lunar Module.

There is also a funny anecdote which is told every time this topic is mentioned.

The commander of Apollo-12, Pete Conrad, was friends with an Italian journalist, Oriana Fallaci, who was convinced that the famous words were given into Armstrong's mouth by NASA. Pete Conrad of course denied this vehemently, and told Ms Fallaci, that he can say whatever he damn pleases on the occasion of his own landing. The lady was unconvinced, so Conrad offered to bet 500 USD that he will say: ""Whoopee! Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one for me."" Namely Pete Conrad was a short man by astronaut standards, actually he was the shortest in the whole corps, while Neil Armstrong was a rather tall man.

Needless to say, Pete Conrad did utter the agreed sentence on live TV, though whether or not he collected his win, I do not know.

Then using this you go backwards to find how many yards a TD over a FG is worth.

How I like to visualize it is that the yards from 20 yards out to the goal line don't really have almost any ""real value"" because a FG attempt from the 20 yard line is only marginally more difficult than a FG attempt from the goal line. This means that the entirety of the ""value"" of that field position is concentrated at the goal line. 

Or in other words driving from 20 yards out to 1 yard out is worth nothing without getting that one last yard, in which you acquire all the value of those yards.",1546300809

Here's another source that it *does not* do any redundancy as you stated: https://serverfault.com/questions/377892/zfs-how-do-you-restore-the-correct-number-of-copies-after-losing-a-drive. So no, FreeNAS, ZFS or whatever you choose to use, does not have file based RAID. 

Obviously running RAID0 is extremely risky and probably not very smart. But what you are trying to do is almost worse. It gives a wrong sense of security, thinking you have high redundancy and thinking you can't lose data, so you lack a bit on backups. Eventually the whole thing crashes down on you and you lose everything. What you are trying to do simply cannot be done in the way you think it can. It can be replicated, it can be backed up but in the end, *it is not RAID* and it has *a lot* of faults. Just use backups instead. It would effectively be the same as some of the things you linked, just better. The other types don't offer redundancy but just replication. Backups offer backups, which in essence is better than replication. If you delete a file accidentally the replication will delete it too. If you overwrite it by mistake, it will do it too. Backups on the other hand, will keep the files in the original state for the period you want.",1546300810

"opiates","t5_2r0y3","Ok let's begin.


Taste:  heroin can only be bitter. So bitter it lasts minutes after initial taste. The most accurate fake dope looked spot on, texture, consistency, color, weight, shot color.....however, as is routine for me, I taste the tiny residue on the circular plunger grip/ handle. That's what I use to stir and mix my shot because my doctor that removed my surgery said using the rubber black part should never be used. It goes inside the rig carrying bacteria/ particulate you tried filtering with the cotton.

So, this dope was spot on and I thought good old above average heroin. The taste tho... Multiple attempts... Bitter....
BUT THE BITTER DISSIPATED IN SECONDS. FAKE!

so, always taste for lingering bitterness.

TASTE FENT: most commonly sweet tasting. Sometimes has notes of floral( dead serious) a medicine taste is also reported. I personally check for a slight tangy sensation. It really is jus tangy without a flavor to that tangy sensation.  Since heroin will never taste completely sweet, you,have fent..

Next, color:  heroin can range from white to dark brown. Greyshg concrete.  Now. The real indicator is how the shot looks while prepping. Heroin off the streets simply is never clear. Unless you're receiving pure heroin from a hospital, its got color. Even SEA #4 HAS A FAINT YELLOWNESS TO IT.  Most heroin goes from piss yellow to near black ice tea.  Now, almost always it's not cloudy but clear when that dark. As in, you can see that the dark color isn't from being murky.  Usually there's a golden tint/ hue with the color.  Now, remember what I said above that you won't be getting medical grade, so  HEROIN will never completely clear. Anyone who tells you it does is plain fuckin wrong.  

Color, fent: fent is most commonly seen with absolutely no color. Clear. Although it can be mixed with heroin and have3 color that way.


Now CONSISTENCY IN POWDER STATE:  this one is less revealing
HEROIN: Can be white flakes looking like paint chips to tan powder that has some fluff to it. But heroin WILL NEVER HAVE SHINY CRYSTAL TYPE SHIT IN IT.

FENT: comes in a variety of cuts and consistency. Often has sparkly glitter looking shit. If its super white, Fluffy, and extremely fine particulates, it might be fent. As I said this observation is less informative.

LAST STEP: ALWAYS DO A TEST BUMP/ SHOT


NOW, WITH THESE CERTAINTIES, COMMONALITIES, AND USING EXPERIENCE, A USER SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM BEING HIGHLY confident identifying their product. Before or after the tester too.  This will,become easier with experience after you start paying attention to the characteristics of your,drug.


I've used this for 15 years IVING WIthout any surprise disasters.

Anyone sayin this is false or BS are newbs who dk shit. Any veteran user will have this knowledge as well. This can and will save your life. Good luck abf be smart.

While I can‚Äôt deny individual horrible things have occurred, they‚Äôre not governmental policies. Israel routinely goes out of its way and puts its own soldiers in harms way to prevent human casualties, while the PA / Hamas do the exact opposite - they hide their weapons in schools and hospitals. 

Also, while it‚Äôs tragic what is happening to the Palestinians living in the territories...what‚Äôs the alternative? If Israel didn‚Äôt do what it does, their citizens would be under constant threat from terror attacks; another intefada would rise up. They‚Äôve only stopped because Israel has put in place these things to protect their people. 

A governments primary responsibility is to protect their citizens. Israel is doing that, as is its right. The Palestinian people need a government who will do the same for them. Until then, everyone loses. 

We can go back and forth, and I appreciate your civil tone. But we won‚Äôt change each other‚Äôs mind as we are living and accepting different facts.

1) Game logic is not at 60FPS, only the display engine. Some game engines run at the refresh rate, but that has huge problems associated with it (for instance, a low frame rate can make physics simulations go wrong if you link them).

2) You can use algorithms to determine the exact time something would happen. You can therefore have higher accuracy than the rate at which the physics engine updates. EG: If you are 10m away, and I fire a shot at you at 100m/s, I can calculate it will hit you in 0.1s. You do not need to calculate it every 0.1s to have that accuracy.",1546300817

* People sharing their unpopular opinion that are actually popular

* r/Cars giving condolences to sedans that died, even though it wasn't very good and largely forgettable
* FCA putting a V8 in the Jeep renegade
* People wishing for cars with features and specs when one already exist, but they don't want THAT one
* Some more manual circle jerk
* Benchracing 0-60 times and make a big deal about 0.5s difference

"vinyl","t5_2qh7i","From left to right:

Brockhampton - iridescence: A great album from the best boyband in show business. I liked the Saturation trilogy a bit more, but this was a solid commercial debut. The album is pressed on clear vinyl.

Childish Gambino - Awaken, My Love!: More of a fan of Donald Glover when he raps, but this is an amazing album. The production is very funky, wild, and soulful. I‚Äôd recommend it, even if you are more of a rap fan.

Childish Gambino - Because the Internet: LOVE this album. In my opinion, it‚Äôs his best in terms of lyrics and being conceptual. My only gripe is that the record labels don‚Äôt say what songs are on each side, which is quite annoying.

Daft Punk - Discovery: One of my favorite electronic albums. Even 17 years later, this album sounds fantastic. Still need to procure a copy of Random Access Memories.

Denzel Curry - TA13OO: One of my favorite albums this year. Denzel brings incredible lyricism over 3 different acts. It‚Äôs also on this translucent red vinyl with white splatter.

Kali Uchis - Isolation: This album is a bit out of my comfort zone, but if you‚Äôre a fan of Flower Boy by Tyler, the Creator, this album is definitely worth a listen. It‚Äôs pressed on opaque blue vinyl.

Kanye West - MBDTF: One of my favorite albums of all time. This was the one that started my collection. The covers are interchangeable, and it includes a poster. Just like everyone else, I hate how they pressed it. Why does only Monster take up one side?!

Kanye West - ye: The second album from Kanye‚Äôs insane summer of releases, this record shows him at his most vulnerable. No filler whatsoever. I still need Kids See Ghosts and DAYTONA though...

Kendrick Lamar - good kid, m.A.A.d city: A classic hip hop album from this decade. Listen to it if you haven‚Äôt. Songs like Sing About Me are beautiful.

Kendrick Lamar - To Pimp a Butterfly: Possibly the best rap album of the decade. A beautiful meeting of jazz and hip hop. It‚Äôs not an easy listen, but it is very worth it.

Mac Miller - GO:OD AM: This was somewhat difficult to find, but it is my favorite album from him. Had to get it after his passing. RIP.

SZA - Ctrl: Another great R&amp;B record. One of my favorite albums from 2017. It‚Äôs pressed on translucent green vinyl.

Travis Scott - Rodeo: Best trap album, change my mind. The experimental production that Travis brought on his debut definitely turned some heads. While I don‚Äôt think his other work is as great, this is a fantastic rap album.

A Tribe Called Quest - Midnight Marauders: CLASSIC. I even like this album a bit more than The Low End Theory. I‚Äôd give it a listen if you‚Äôre into jazzy hip hop.

That‚Äôs it! Well beyond the 300 character minimum, but that‚Äôs alright.",1546300818

**Top Seasonals of 2018**

Title | Score | Comment
----|-----|-----|-------
Sora Yori| 9.5 | AotY. I need to rewatch this.
3-gatsu no Lion S2| 9| it's weird to put it in the seasonals since I watched the whole series in like April and don't think of it as a seasonal, but it fits. Akari is my wife.
Violet Evergarden| 9| This wasn't super consistent, but the amazing episodes were enough to counter the meh ones for me.
Hinamatsuri | 9| Heartwarming and hilarious. Anzu is my daughter.
SSSS.Gridman | 9 | Pure fun. this is like a Saturday morning cartoon with a sprinkle of Evangelion and I loved it. Shinjo is my wife.
Shoujo Kageki Revue Starlight | 9 | While I enjoyed how much fun the over-the-top characters were, I wouldn't love it this much if it didn't have [one of the best OSTs I've ever heard.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5aF-kURrwc) absolutely charming and magical.

Clannad After Story| 10| Tomoya's growth in the early parts of the series was really inspiring to me as a guy reaching the end of school and nearing the working world. how the fuck has it not even been a year since I watched this?
Evangelion | 9.5| Never before this series have I felt the need to spend hours on fan wikis after watching to read about the lore and theories. amazing experience.
Koe no Katachi| 9.5 | Ishida is super relatable and I really respect it for being the rare story about a bully's growth rather than the bullied. The red x's over everyone's face is one of the best representations of social anxiety I've seen.
Monogatari| 9| dunno how much of it I watched this year but the entire ride has been amazing and fun. All girls are best girl.
FMA:B| 9| Really well-written story with a great world. I think this was the first time I gave a long-running anime a chance.
Haikyuu| 9| I haven't found a show that gets me this excited in a long time. I'm planning to go to my uni's volleyball games once they start because of this.
Jojo's Bizarre Adventure| 8.5| Parts 1 and 3 were 7-8/10 for me, but 2 and 4 are solid 9/10. Love the series, probably one of my favorite subreddit rewatches too.

Also, Nissan does not recommend routinely topping up when above 80%. You did not tell us what level of charging the other LEAF was at: 1st, 2nd or 3rd blinking light.

"animationcareer","t5_3982v","I speculate that it has more to do with the different ways we approach production. As stated before, japan values cost effectiveness and efficiency. In the US, we like spectacle. Our most cherished animated features pay great attention to detail and we utilize most of our expression through the face.

Think about [this scene from The Lion King](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkU23m6yX04) just watch the first 3 seconds. It's not him at his most expressive, but even then, look at how much motion there is and how it makes him feel more real and fluid. Now, watch the rest of the video and watch how his face moves and how the shapes change as he speaks and sings. It is obviously exaggerated form what real life looks like, but the exaggeration give a spectacle to the whole thing that makes it gripping to watch. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, look at Spirited Away. It's amazing, a fantastic example of animation from japan. Look at Sen's face vs Yubaba's. Which is more fluid and which brings more life to the character. Protip: Yubaba. Step to a lower grade production: Naruto. People talk, but unless they use a large motion for something dramatic, it doesn't have the same expressiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

Japaneese storytelling through animation differs from western in that they focus on other things to convey the scene. The tension, the gravity, the importance, all of it comes from elsewhere. It's a common complaint that most anime is ""just people grunting and looking intensely at something"" and that complain is made with good reason. Those dramatic poses and grunting bits chew up screen time and when scored with the right music add tension, but my problem (my opinion) is that they're relying on the soundtrack too heavily to make up for ""cut corners"".

&amp;#x200B;

An interesting experiment that just came to mind: Mute youtube (no subtitles either) and only watch the physical motions of an episode of an anime vs and episode from an american show. Study the physical movements overall and see how they differ. You can repeat with a major film from both styles as well (Howl's Moving Castle and Frozen?).",1546300820

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","Constructive criticism:

You need to build a more solid foundation for your drawing. This character has no form or weight, it doesn't feel like a real object that exists in a space (an illusion that is a primary goal of representational art like this).

Take the time to make things line up right. It's not hard or very time consuming to make sure things are where they should be. For example, his armor exposes far more of his left pectoral than his right. That could be intentional, but if not it's an easy thing to correct in the future. The same goes for the notch taken out of his ear.

Details like the little lines on the hems of his armor should be used to enhance form or better represent the imagined reality. Those randomly placed dashes aren't doing anything, when they should be curved to show the curvature of that round piping.

His hair doesn't seem like it's actually growing out of his head. It just looks like spikes placed with no rhyme or reason. Again, it doesn't take much effort to plot these things out.

The coloring doesn't make much sense. There seems to be three different light sources. Coloring and shading should communicate the form, and if you don't have any form in mind then it's just haphazard. The color choices are also odd. The face and neck are shaded with a much darker color, but the hair has very little contrast. And the neon yellow doesn't mesh with the rest of the colors at all.

Finally, this is a matter of taste but if more of your photo is occupied by the tools used to make the drawing than by the drawing itself, it begs the question of what you're actually taking a picture of. Artists will often include a pen or pencil in photographs of their work but the primary purpose is to show scale. Fourteen markers, a pen and a pencil are a little overkill.",1546300821

At worst, you've removed yourself from play and might as well be in the stands with all the other eggs at that point. At best, you now have full boost, and are now past the ball facing away from it with a full head of steam.

In Snow Day, the best standard formation i've found is 1st goes for puck, 2nd goes for back corner boost, and 3rd stays the hell put in the goal. WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING, 1st knocks the puck to the side where his 2nd is getting boost. Now, 2nd comes up with a full head of steam, and is usually on the wall, with the puck, and full boost while 1 to 2/3 of the opponent team is sitting at mid with no boost. Goalie grabs boost and returns to a defensive position. If the 1st can get a side boost, you now have a 2v1 with their goalie, 2 out of 3 of them have no boost and are behind you, AND you still have a fully fueled 3rd man waiting for if things go south.

That's just 1 of many scenarios, but playing with randos this seems to work most of the time as a general thing.",1546300824

&gt; Federal workers on Wednesday sued the U.S. government over the shutdown, protesting the requirement that employees who are considered &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; must report to work without pay, a major federal workers&amp;#039; union announced Monday.

&gt; Interested in Government Shutdown? Add Government Shutdown as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Government Shutdown news, video, and analysis from ABC News.

&gt; The American Federation of Government Employees, one of the largest federal workforce unions, said it filed the lawsuit because it isn&amp;#039;t fair to force people to work without pay and disrupt paychecks, especially for workers who protect public safety.

Studies have shown people assume someone is staring more often than they are, if it's dark/they're wearing shades or they can't see them well. So a lot of that is luck or assumption 

Also when you turn your head to see if someone's looking at you, people behind you naturally may look because the movement catches their eye. Or if you think someone might be staring at you you often stare at them while trying to gauge it, which makes them stare back like ""umm hello?""
So lots of false positives make us think we can tell even when someone is behind us or not visible to us, but it's only real perception when you can see the whites of their eyes",1546300824

If you get a different GPU you'll want to get a better power supply unit. Additionally, a 580 is just as good as a 1060 so don't take that as a push for a 1060 specifically. Budget.

That said, I'd go for either a Vega GPU or an Nvidia 1070Ti for value reasons. A 1070 is the lowest I'd personally go just because playing VR on low (1060 / 580) is way different from med - high settings. With a 2070 (overclocked to roughly 1080Ti stock performance) I'm running with Max settings and supersampled (higher resolution image that then gets downscaled for better image quality) resolution which is massively better than my R9 270 running at 70% resolution, min settings.

Edit: If you're new to PC building I just want to offer a few tidbits of wisdom:

1. Power Supply Calculators exist and will tell you how much power your parts need. Ez Google c:

2. Overclocking on Nvidia GPUs and AMD Ryzen cpus is ez af. Auto-overclocking is good enough and you can get to manual later when you're not as overwhelmed.

3. Go for the Zen+ architecture always. 2600 and not 1600 for instance. They're faster per clock which matters.

4. DDR4 Ram Speed / Frequency matters. 3200 is worth the cost and I'd argue that more is better. Always get sticks of ram in multiples of 2. Odd numbers = bad. Dont do it. (I could be wrong but at least don't do 1 stick)

5. Build inside of the motherboard box and then add it into the case. Trust me. I bent my CPU pins. Don't fuck this up by building in the case and getting ""stuck* in there. ._. I fixed the CPU but it was heart wrenching. Tl;Dr I ""dropped"" the CPU cooler mount behind the motherboard. The cooler was attached to my CPU. I pulled the motherboard out but it got caught on the case and tilted enough for the cooler to rip the CPU out of the socket.",1546300827

"yimby","t5_2ve0m","&gt;rent control

So let's just get out of the way now that the economic consensus is unanimously against rent control.  People you're discussing things with may themselves have a poor understanding of why rent control is bad, but people also have a poor understanding of evolution, climate change, or a heliocentric solar system.  But the expert consensus on all these things is very clear.

&gt;When I asked what people priced out of their current neighborhoods were supposed to do

Charitable answer: Rent vouchers are a better solution than rent control because they don't artificially keep prices down, they just help poor people pay the equilibrium prices set by the market.

Uncharitable answer: move

&gt;Because, new housing supply instantly reduces housing prices overall (and not after, say, five years time)

Well yeah, we should have started years ago but delaying things even further is just gonna make things worse in the long run.

&gt;increasing congestion and pollution as they now have to commute farther

I mean the real ambition here is to pack people closer together and urban infill and high rises are how that's done.  As you said earlier, this won't happen immediately, but we need to get the right incentive structure in place.  Would you rather the rich people keep extending out single-family suburbs?  At least when poor move out from the city center, they'll be highly motivated to keep costs down with multi-family dwellings.

&gt;some libertarian rag about how rent control is terrible

This isn't a libertarian plot, this is just economic consensus as a whole.  Everyone across the field from the left to right agrees that rent control is bad.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","Bit of lore for a project called **Interregnum**, a series of stories set thousands of years after the United Nations of Earth has colonized the galaxy and collapsed into a myriad of squabbling factions, forging new ways to tread old paths.
___
The Khoza Company is one of the Old Corporations: for-profit entities that were founded on Earth and survived the Fall. While there are dozens, or even hundreds, of companies that belong to this group, Khoza Co. specifically is part of the Big Three: corporations so large and powerful they quite nearly act as sovereign states and, barring a complete breakdown of interstellar civilization, are too large to ever fail. Khoza Co. was founded as a speciality grocer and imported general goods store in the late 21st century in Germany by a South African immigrant. While the founder lent his name to the company, he has ironically been forgotten over millennia. So muddled is the history that some argue he was a she, or that the one was many, or that the entire Company had merely been a crafted subsidiary of some other corporation and the founder merely a character used in advertisements. Regardless of its origins, the first Khoza Import and Grocer Corner Store spawned a franchise, slowly honing its brand towards customer satisfaction, upscale appeal, and affordability. The Company performed a series of purchases and investments to create vertical integration and diversify their income pool, often maintaining purchased brands. At some point during the early Diaspora, when slower-than-light travel and hibernation pods were still used to hoist humanity to other worlds, the Company began serious research and development into artificial intelligence, engineering, and weapons for use by the United Nations Peacekeepers. With the discovery of riftlanes and proliferation of FTL civilization across the galaxy, the UNP found themselves relying heavily on Khoza Co. products to keep independence movements down and combat piracy, terrorists, and other fringe militant elements. 
___
During the Fall, Khoza Company leveraged its presence as an arms dealer to support powerful separatists, warlords, and other agitators. Its was during the Fall that Khoza Co. solidified its stranglehold on mercenary work in the galaxy, growing its forces from a small group of corporate security to a myriad of employed and contracted guns for hire, all willing to kill for a quick buck. While many CEOs and controlling interests ended up gutting their companies and amassing private wealth to become the Noble Houses, the constant flow of capital and expansion of assets that Khoza Co. experienced didn‚Äôt just inhibit such behaviour: it made it impossible. Rapid expansion and increased valuation had encouraged constant stock splits, purchases, and de-centralization that no one person or group had enough power to leverage such a gutting.
___
The Khoza Company has its fingers in many pies across the galaxy, reflecting its ancient roots as a general goods store, but few realize this reality. While many subsidiary brands of Khoza Co. may be found in a household environment, the umbrella corporation is known primarily for developing and manufacturing weapons, voidcraft, terrestrial war machines, and mercenary contracts. It is this industry that the Khoza Co. dominates and disseminates its brand. Where there is war, there are almost always Khoza Co. armaments at play. So unscrupulous are the Board of Directors that there exists while volumes of literature dedicated to conflicts that saw Khoza Co mercenary groups pitted against each other. In some cases this in-fighting can be chalked up to the gargantuan beast that makes up the company‚Äôs payroll and assets, it is not unheard of fro various contractors to be assigned opposing sides in order to motivate higher performance scores, eliminate intracompany rivals, and even shift the entire scope of the conflict to benefit Khoza Co. more. Unfortunately for the customers, the business of Khoza Co is so vast and the galaxy so large that such instances of client betrayal rarely spread, and often only as unsavory rumors.
___
Khoza Co. has particularly tight relations with House Wa-Uzbreke, as they use the family‚Äôs myriad of unsavory bloodsports and iron-fisted governing methods to test, advertise, and even manufacture their arms. They also have a strained, but professional, relationship with House De-Sansali, who offer competing mercenary and arms services to high-end customers. As the De-Sansali‚Äôs are a Noble House and not a company to be bought or manipulated, Khoza Co. begrudgingly accepts, and at times respects, this market competition.
___
Compared to the other two of the Big Three, Khoza Co. directly owns and operates relatively few worlds directly, though a number of ‚Äòindependent‚Äô worlds have unusually high numbers of Khoza Co. employees and assets, and are ‚Äòprotected‚Äô solely by Khoza Co. licensed mercenary groups.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","## Why was my post removed?

Images, screenshots, or gifs uploaded through the Reddit app or the reddit website are not allowed; as such, your post has been removed.  We only allow images as part of a discussion post, or if hosted on a portfolio site; gameplay gifs must be hosted on another website and that link shared to reddit.

## How do I submit images or screenshots?

You may submit your post as a [discussion (self) post](/r/Overwatch/submit?selftext=true) with some context - more than just a single line of text - speaking about the image. If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

## How do I submit a gameplay highlight?

You may submit your gameplay highlight by uploading it to a GIF/video sharing website and submitting the link to /r/Overwatch. We do not support uploading gameplay highlights directly through the Reddit app/website at this time.

[Please see the subreddit rules for more information.](/r/Overwatch/wiki/rules) Thanks!

It doesn't take sola scriptura to reject the various Marian beliefs.  You can even do so with a very high view of tradition, since they don't appear to be beliefs dating back to the Apostles.

I don't say this to attack you, or to hold myself up as a model citizen, but the problem is not with the system.  It is with the people.  No changes to election rules, third parties, campaign finance, etc., are ever going to prevent lying profiteers from making appeals to our stupidity.  

The government is ours.  The problem is that many of ""us"" are either bad people, genuinely stupid, or some combination.  If they truly are the majority, we're fucked, but I don't think any of us honestly believe that to be the case.  

Hobbling the government will not do anything to slow down the Mitch McConnels of the world.  All it will do is make it so they don't have to bother with the whole facade of elections and pretending to govern.  If the government isn't strong enough to be worth trying to take advantage of it, it sure as hell isn't going to be strong enough to do anything about the criminals outside of it.  

Our government is not ideal, but no change in the system is going to do anything without a change in us.  There's no point fine tuning your car for 2% better performance if you're still letting a drunk orangutan drive it.  ",1546300829

If we stop for a time, even a long time, we return to our old pattern if we drink again.   I have seen this happen many times - it has happened to me.

I was a binge drinker, with binges fairly separated, maybe 2-3 a month.  Mine would usually be 3 days total (one day getting drunk, one day staying drunk, one day tapering off and stopping).  I managed to fit this in with my profession without much trouble or notice from others.  But my wife (wives) and family certainly noticed.  I was a destruction machine in my home life - cheating, disappearing, blowing money, etc.

After 30 or so years I simply tired of cleaning up after myself.  I worked hard to be sober, affiliated with AA, and have ended the pattern for over 15 years.  No one could ever tell me to do that.  I had to ‚Äúwear it out‚Äù.",1546300831

"television","t5_2qh6e","There‚Äôs an advantage to pleading not guilty, generally. Especially in high profile cases like this one. 

If you plea guilty you‚Äôre basically stuck with whatever the judge decides, and most of the times that‚Äôs not a good thing. You‚Äôre essentially guaranteeing that you will get a sentence. If you plea not guilty you have a chance of lessoning whatever sentence the judge might impose by explaining yourself or if you‚Äôre truly not guilty, provide evidence to establish innocence. 

A lot of people will plea not guilty if they‚Äôre being accused of a *serious* crime because their lawyers can make deals and argue their case effectively to reduce whatever sentence they may or may not get. Since the right to a lawyer is guaranteed by the constitution, many will plea not guilty in the arraignment.  Whether you‚Äôre rich or poor. 

There‚Äôs no implication about him being rich(lol). It‚Äôs not due to him drawing it out or having lots of lawyers (which he probably does), it‚Äôs that he isn‚Äôt stupid and no one would plead guilty for a felony unless you give zero fucks about anything in the universe.",1546300832

"BattlefieldV","t5_2uxp8","The first 2 days of a Grand Operation literally don't matter for the total outcome of the game.

You could steamroll the Airborne part and blow up all cannons, rush through the Breakthrough and capture everything and if in the third map the enemies just have a victory with a very slim margin they still win the Grand Operation overall with a ""Major Victory"" which is frustrating.

You put in all this effort with the team, dominate the entirety with but a minor part on the last game out of the 3 and you get a loss. 
Also the rewards are partially useless as I vaguely recall reading it on here that in one of the Grand Operations the attackers get a boost to tank respawn timer in a map that does not give them tanks.

Then there is the ""Last Stand"" game mode which only seems to appear if the last game ends in a draw, which happened literally once for me in like 20 Grand Operations and actually is quite fun.


Grand Operations in total just feel like a playlist of 3 maps with the first one being more often than not a frustrating shitfest for either the attacking team or defending team because nothing gets done. Also Grand Operations in Norway still have that amusing ""start of round everyone gets fucked by a bomber"" problem that used to exist because the C flag on the third map (Fjell 652) has a plane spawn on the C flag which initially belongs to the Axis team and if someone snipes the bomber spawn there you can carpet bomb the shit out of the attacking team at either A or B, maybe even do both if you use the cluster bombs for one flag and the big ones for the other. Due to the nature of the map you have guaranteed chokepoints at which you can get large groups.",1546300833

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","Realistically, if any of our past ‚Äúaccomplishments‚Äù in the Mid East are to be taken in to account I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs best we cut our losses and leave. These wars siphon billions and trillions of America‚Äôs wealth. Money which could provide much needed services for our ppl here in the US.

It‚Äôs also no secret we (either deliberately or inadvertently) funded ‚Äúrebels‚Äù who ended up being part of the Islamic state in Syria. I lean more on the side of deliberate myself. Not to mention the white helmet debacle which exposed them directly working with ISIS militants.

I don‚Äôt believe our resources are well spent in Syria, nor were we invited in. Why squabble resources, American lives, and finances on another Iraq or Afghanistan? It‚Äôs been proven some of the gas attacks were fake and the results staged by white helmets. With that in mind and the lies we were told about WMDs in Iraq, I have no qualms about packing up and getting the hell out. When the establishment media and political hacks clamor for us to stay, you know we need to leave.

These are wars of neocons and neoliberals. Not Average Joe or Jane American. Sure they step up to the plate to serve their country bravely and I commend that. But we have internal issues that in my opinion far exceed the need to yet again intervene in another ME country.

I felt that way more in Georgia than I do in Vermont, though both places seemed pretty friendly.  But there are SUBTLE DIFFERENCES between the two areas that I would have trouble putting my finger on.  
I never loved Georgia.  I learned to like it, but it never felt right to me.  A lot of that is cultural, part is just being in the land where you grew up, nothing feels like home.
My general impression of Georgia compared to VT is that it's faster paced, harder to make decent money, poorer, and more ethnically diverse.  
Property taxes as I understand it are fairly high, but then there are a lot of services you get such as snow plowing and sanding.  The government is generally pretty hands off, live and let live is the philosophy.

Heating costs vary widely depending upon energy efficiency and heating method.  I buy $700 worth of heating fuel for my 2-bedroom apt and it lasts the whole winter.  People use wood, electric, various types of gas, solar, so it really depends.  Heat tends to be a big cost, but having worked on houses in Georgia I can say our insulation is better.  All in all, there is still more if a possibility to make money here than in GA.",1546300838

&amp;#x200B;

I think really all that can be done besides the already established laws and enforcement against drunk driving is to just have a car that can handle much more impact and to wear your seatbelts and hope for the best, there's also cars that use AI to predict an incoming crash and makes a calculation, attempts to swerve you out of the way, and it has prevented a very good amount of crashes, but at the moment it is both expiremental and expensive, however i can see this being huge in the future once the prices are dropped and it is a more stable system.

&amp;#x200B;

Driving in general is just a huge fucking risk for your life, even if you're completely sober and have really good awareness and reflex, bad people will always exist and i think we should focus more on the actual cars themselves to make it much less dangerous overall.",1546300839

R2: Kelsier gets a Shardspear through the face and dies immediately. Atium will keep him alive for however long he burns it. Once he runs out he's fucked.

R3: Kaladin gets murdered horribly. A Shardblade might actually kill the LR if he gets hit in the neck/head but Kaladin isn't fast enough to land a blow as long as the LR keeps his metalminds up, which he will. Also the LR is probably powerful enough to Push on a Shardblade, granted that won't do much considering they can teleport to your hand.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","You should never deposit cash into an ATM.  If a mistake is made there is no physical proof that you actually put the correct amount in the envelope and you can get really screwed.  

I used to work for a bank and have seen this happen.  

Edit:  The biggest risk comes from the type of machine that accepts envelopes with the cash or check inside and the bank confirms amounts when emptying said envelopes.  People who thought they were clever were putting in empty envelopes and saying they had cash in.  

I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre less likely to get screwed with a counting machine but it‚Äôs still possible.  I‚Äôve seen it where bills have stuck together and the machine counted only one for example.  If you aren‚Äôt paying attention you could approve the wrong amount.  So many people click through on autopilot and it‚Äôs not guaranteed that your bank will bother confirming the mistake by hand.  Logically you‚Äôd think they would find an extra bill when emptying the machine and you‚Äôd be ok but it‚Äôs not guaranteed.  

Note I didn‚Äôt say you will get screwed, just that you COULD get screwed.  If you‚Äôve never encountered a problem I‚Äôm happy for you.  I‚Äôm just saying as the person who has seen it from the other end... when errors happen the burden of proof is on you and sometimes the branch is less than helpful with resolution.",1546300842

Scorpio Sun/Mars, Taurus Moon, Sag Mercury. Which you didn't ask for, I realize. Mercury just seems too important to omit, from my perspective. MBTI is largely a conscious self-evaluation and very conscience-based, from my understanding, so how you think and what actions you take based on how taking that action impacts you/the world around you alters how you choose to answer each question. Mercury is an intellectual planet, plenty mischievous and entirely capable of self-deception without realizing you're following the wrong path or not viewing yourself clearly.  I'd think this would impact an individuals result, potentially to their detriment. 

I'm an INTP. Apologies if you at all feel I've stepped on your toes, this is far from my intention, brainstorming methods of systemic improvement is fairly compulsive for me. I'd be curious to take this a step further and add house placements to the mix, but it's not my study, so imma refrain from babbling at you any more.

Also, keep in mind it's easy for a lot of us to scoff at $2.15, but for some people $2.15 is the difference between paying for lunch for their child or not.

I think anyone questioning the French bravery in battle should do two things. 
1. Listen to Dan Carlin's Hardcore History's Armageddon series on World War 1.  It will change your mind.
2. As suggested in the podcast above, look up pictures of the French Cavalry in World War 1. Amazing dress, incredibly brave. Unfortunately, they were using weapons, armour and tactics from the late Napoleon era. These cavalry men led charges against machine guns in the early days of the war. They were decimated. Yet, the survivors kept trying until they are effectively wiped out.

The first world war involved a huge technological leap in ways to kill your fellow man. It took years for the generals on all sides to find any way to win a battle. Millions died while they tested different theories, including much of the French army.

I averaged a 5.28/10 day rating and 7.62 hours of sleep.

They can't go, ""well there aren't very many healers so I'll do that and I can be useful right away!"" if half the people there can heal. 

In my experience, it's pretty easy to motivate people just by giving them shiny tokens to wear for accomplishing a goal. You don't need character progression at all!

Cassidy barely (if at all) played Bjork in the top 6 this year. Bjork looked great last year when he started with Marchand and Bergeron. It's hard for a skilled kid to succeed when he's playing with replacement level players... so I want to see them put him in a spot to succeed. And then I can stop listening to you knuckleheads claiming Bjork isn't NHL material because he couldn't stack points next to Joakim Nordstrom, Chris Wagner, Noel Acciari, David Backes, and a struggling Heinen. I would venture a guess you're also a huge Donato backer, because that's the way it seems to be with every anti-Bjork Bruins fan wank that seems to think for Donato to succeed, Bjork has to fail.

Right now Bruce loves rolling two plus fourth lines... I'm not into that kind of hockey, but if you like watching that garbage then this teams for you!

Eh I'm a fanboy in that I buy a Nexus/Pixel every year, but I'm fairly critical of them. The only reason I keep going back is because they give me a slightly better experience than the competition. There's plenty that Google should be embarrassed by. I think it's fine to be fans of a product, but as long as you feel that you can be relatively objective.

For instance as a Pixel 3 Owner here's what I have to say:

* Battery life sucks, my iPhone 8 Plus blows it out of the water
* Camera rocks, but I wish HDR+ didn't go so heavy handed on the color processing. Also HDR+ eats up battery FAST.
* Portrait mode is better than the Pixel 2, but still got a ways to go. Dual lens is the way to go. I use my iPhone 8 Plus for portraits for this reason.
* Video needs some work especially in low light. Quality is atrocious, but goes to show why the camera is awesome--Google does a good job with computational photography, but in raw sensor output, it's just trash.
* 128GB maximum is a shame. They should've copied Apple in going 64/256gb since they're in the business of copying notches
* Headphone jack isn't that big of a deal to me, although I would welcome it back in a heartbeat.",1546300848

"eu3","t5_2soil","Yeah, I took the inflation hit to fund a ton of mercs which is why my manpower is still at about 70% of capacity. Planning on releasing a few vassals and then feeding them provinces. Rebels have been dealt with, but my main problems now are:

a) England, Castile, Bohemia declaring for cores

b) German OPMs declaring punitive wars and then having to draw troops away

c) High revolt risk from war exhaustion and nationalists

The current rebels were actually not too bad to deal with considering I still have a deathstack, but it‚Äôs gonna take a bit to fully stabilize the country. I expect bad stuff to happen soon as Bohemia loves to demand provinces (hence the HRE vassal strategy). In any case, the aggressive early strategy should make this a very interesting game.

I had tea with Dusk again today. This is becoming a daily event. I know that I offered to make tea for him, but I did not expect him to take up the offer so frequently. Not that I mind. It's rather nice to spend a tranquil moment with our Summoner.  *\hellish image of two warped figures around what may or may not be a turtle*\

A interesting thing I've learned us that he has an appreciation for my artwork. I know that it is rather... unpleasant to most, but he seems to enjoy it. I remember him saying, ""It doesn't matter how it looks. It's a hobby you enjoy and it makes you happy. As long as you're satisfied with it, that's all that matters. Besides, it's better than what I can do."" And he was right. I know my own work isn't very appealing, but his is just bad. He laughed when he noticed my expression. But it is nice to find someone who I can share my work with. Especially since Orochi isn't here. (Dusk has promised to keep an eye on the future for her.) *\a scene of a demon offering tribute to horrified slime monster*\

I was wary at first, when he asked to have tea with me. I had seen the looks he had given the other women in our army. I was certain he was going to try something less than polite. As a kunoichi, my appeal is another tool to use in the elimination of targets. Men are especially foolish around pretty girls. But he has been nothing but respectful. Not long ago, I asked why he kept having tea with me. ""Why? Well, when a beautiful long-haired curvy gal who can wipe out an enemy unit by herself offers you tea, you accept!"" He laughed. But I think he noticed the look of disappointment on my face because he followed up. ""In all seriousness, I just find your prescence extremely relaxing. These little tea breaks are a welcome reprieve from the daily stresses I face. Just get to sit down, relax, enjoy some pleasant conversation, and let a strong, gorgeous woman give me cake.""  *\two ghouls are on either side of pit of disease. One is eating severed heads.*\

Dusk is shameless flirt, but he would never risk offending someone by doing so. He is a good conversationalist, able to discuss many topics with confidence. And I recently learned he has insomnia, which would explain his erratic behavior and why he always seems tired. Perhaps I should offer my bed during our next meeting? Hmmm, on second thought, no. He might take that the wrong way. As might I...   Either way. He is a good man. Though my life is pledged in service to Lord Ryoma, I will serve him to the best of my ability. Be it as a soldier, a bodyguard, or a friend to have tea with.  *\ A demon King stands atop a mountain of corpses, hoisting some horrid instrument aloft. At it's base, a long-clawed hound prepares to strike*\

I decided to sign up this month again on Amazon Prime  in the middle of December because they were giving away GTA V for free(with Amazon credit refund) on Xbox One and was also able to redeem an additional 19 PC games on Twitch including those above.  Great deals so far from  Amazon.  

I am not sure I am renewing my Amazon/Twitch Prime sub after this month especially since I get the same games(3 of the above listed 4 games for example) plus AAA games on my humble bundle sub but I think it pays to sign up on Prime intermittently when deals like these show up. 

However, I am starting to think that Amazon Prime(with its Twitch Prime bonus PC games) is the best monthly subscription you can get if you both stream movies and tv shows as well as play games on PC plus get free shipping on orders.

You have a burden of proof. You realize you can't meet that burden. Rather than admit you have no good reason to believe in your god, you want to try to diminish the value of evidence, and put everything else on the same playing field. Why do you believe if you have no good reason. If you can't detect your god, then how is it that you think you have a good reason to believe it exists. You don't. This is where your faith comes in. 

Good luck. You still haven't demonstrated that your god exists. Meanwhile, the rest of us realize that we do exist. Enjoy your fantasy land. ",1546300850

Yes! That is not the supposed purpose of tithing. I hate to pull a Christian line here but seriously... what would Jesus do? Do you honestly believe that the Jesus of the Christian bible would have no issues with pastors using the money of poor families to buy himself a giant house or a jet?

Because it's deceptive? If pastors went around asking for donations for themselves then fine, whatever. However, they go around promising that God will favour those who send them money and they send letters to little old ladies encouraging them to send their pension cheques to ""the church"". I also consider Nigerian scammers to be earning money immorally.

When someone is knowingly promising things for money that they can't personally bring about. Pastors can't talk with God and get any guarantee of what is and isn't on offer- but that doesn't stop promising to cure the incurable and fix the unfixable because they are cunts.",1546300851

"HypotheticalPhysics","t5_dxurs","&gt; Why do you think that the clock rate of the universe is increasing?

Here's the reasoning. I start with the hypothesis that the energy of a photon is constant. I study how a photon's wavelength changes as it travels in gravitational fields. I realize that the energy of a non-moving object is not constant, but is instead proportional to the clock rate. More generally, I notice that three quantities stay proportional to each other: the clock rate, the wavelength of the photon, and the energy of matter.

I decide that this is a universal law. I then apply this law to the cosmological redshift. We know that the wavelength of photons is increasing, so I propose that the clock rate of the universe and the energy of matter are both increasing too.

&gt; Why do you think that the universe is expanding?

&gt; Why do you think that both phenomena must coexist?

Good questions. If a photon's wavelength increases when time passes faster, why even say that the universe is expanding at all? Why not just say that the clock rate of the universe is increasing and that the universe is standing still? Well, I believe there is significant evidence for the metric expansion of space. But I can give you my own reason why I think it's necessary to have both the expansion and the clock rate increase. As space expands, the photon stretches out with it (otherwise the speed of light would not be respected). That's good because the photon's wavelength must increase when the clock rate increases. If there was a clock rate increase without an expansion, the photon would violate the speed of light by elongating.

&gt; Why is the photon's measured energy effected more by the expansion of space than the clock rate increase?

Both phenomena happen together. I wouldn't say that one has more of an effect than the other.

&gt; If the photons were effected by both phenomena, wouldn't their measured energy be the same as when they were emitted, exactly as we observe with normal matter?

I start from the hypothesis that the energy of the photon is constant, so I don't see how that would happen.",1546300852

Schools should be leased. There should be a standard set of school specifications spelling out what is needed for each type of school- elementary, middle, high school. Heating/ cooling, amount of lighting, amount of window space, gymnasium size, cafeteria, etc. Then it should be put up for bid, and the size based on number of students. The lease period should be long enough to get investors to bite, but short enough that districts can maneuver as their needs change.

This would prevent all this foolishness involved in districts owning the buildings, and allow them to focus on education. Let's say the lease is 30 years. At the end of the lease, the building is crappy, falling down, or doesn't really work for the district anymore. They put up a new call for bids for a new building, and let someone else build it.

&amp;#x200B;

1.- Shitty setup.

2.- A 140+ rounds game would take you at least 48 hrs IN GAME, that means no sleeping, eating or shitting  no matter superfast strat you want to mention, if you take breaks,sleep, etc that game could take like a week to complete.

3.- Even with 2xp you wont be able to reach 3+ million, I have the majority of camos, prestiges and challenges done and that LAME excuse of yours is just BS because this is simple as mentioning the OBVIOUS, weapons DONT KILL SHIT after round 50, its either WWs or Helion what really makes all the work.

4.- As for the helion, lets say you somehow after prestige master you did not unlock anything for it, fine, the helion has only 8 levels and 4 attachments, which give you like 150 xp each, and all the camos from 500 to 1500. Thats your 3 million? HA!

5.- In bo3 advacing rounds would give you some xp extra boost, bo4 is different. Lets say the specialists and elixirs for example, they dont fill up by killing, they recharge when earning the POINTS, each time you use one you will need MORE POINTS to recharge it,  rounds in this case is something different as well, you dont get xp for advancing rounds, you get XP for opening doors, headshots, melees, etc but not simply for advancing the rounds, Where are your headshots, melee or  doors at round 100+? Of course deadshot modifier would accidentaly activate SOME, but you had mulekick as the modfier instead, that only increases damage.

I would also put forth that the ""Left"" has been very ademant about attacking JPB and so far has done a terrible job of it, yet they continue to villainize him as some sort of alt-right character, which is fundamentally incorrect.

  
yet even with that, we generally try to discuss topics in good faith despite risking offense.  
and as I think about it, most of our critisisms of the left involve them attacking the very ideals we cherish so it kinda makes sense

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

   #The threshold was raised recently. You might've been able to post before.
   
   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

Anyway! Dude, there's hope, because God shows up in the craziest times to turn our whole attitude around.  


Do this one thing. Go look in a mirror, preferably a tall wall mirror (not a slanted one). Preferably not a bathroom mirror, but something where you can get really face to face with yourself.   
Take a good long look at yourself, and mentally record what you feel when you see yourself. I'm not telling you to blow yourself a kiss, or anything cheesy and self-helpy (not that that's bad at all!), but really think about how you see yourself. Make a note (mental or written) about how you feel when you see yourself, then start asking yourself this:  


How does how I see myself line up with how God sees me? Now if this feels exhausting, or you don't relate to the question, I feel you. But press into it.  


Remind yourself that you're a child of God. Remind yourself that there is a core of your being that is being renewed, resurrected on the inside day by day (which is not to say that a bad day or bad month or bad decade negates this truth).  


Start journaling. Do it on paper, preferably, or if you have a distraction-free computer setup, do that. Start with a blank page and just write, write, write. Let it loose. Anger, fear, sadness, bitterness, whatever.  


Then, turn the page. Remember that core of your being, the one that is being renewed in the image of Christ. That person is you, and that person is very much alive and strong, no matter how you feel about yourself or your life. Take that knowledge and remind yourself that as a Child of God, you do NOT have to feel the way you feel. These are drive-by emotions. I'm not saying they're not real, or that they don't have real causes from the outside world, but the way we react to it is a choice. We can be caught up in that wave, or let the wave pass by us. We do not have to live in depression, or addiction, or anything else that comes from death. I'm not saying that you'll have some instant supernatural experience and feel better in a minute (although I've experienced those boosts, and they sure are fun!), but you can learn to walk out your salvation (of your mind and emotions) day by day.  


If there's anything I can do to help, or more encouragement I can give you, please don't hesitate to respond to this, or to message me.  


I felt just like you do now 24 hours ago. I got reminded that I don't have to feel that way. A lot of things in my life are still up in the air, but I don't have to be up in the air with them. I can be planted on the rock.

But oil by rail has grown more then the larger economy so it's marketshare has increased. 

&gt;The railway‚Äôs quarterly numbers show why the prospect of hauling more crude looks like an incremental benefit rather than an entirely new corridor to profits.

In its third-quarter results for the three-month period ended Sept. 30, CN reported total rail freight revenue of nearly $3.5-billion. But CN is diversified. Within this total revenue, the petroleum and chemicals division produced revenue of $665-million or slightly more than 19 per cent of the total. And crude oil is only an unspecified slice within this number.

CP‚Äôs third-quarter results suggest a similar role for crude oil. The railway‚Äôs energy, chemicals and plastics division generated $339-million in revenue in the three-month period, or about 18 per cent of total freight revenue.

Story continues below advertisement

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs positive, but it‚Äôs not really changing the big picture,‚Äù Amaury Baudouin, an analyst at DBRS, said in an interview.

The good news here is that the numbers for these crude oil-related divisions are rising ‚Äì by 25 per cent year-over-year in the case of CN, compared with just 8 per cent for gains in intermodal revenue and 3 per cent for automotive revenue.

Or are you asking how dangerous it would be to use magma pools in the caverns as your magma source, rather than digging all the way down to the magma sea? It would be a bit dangerous to do that before you had a strong militia, but if you set up a closeable drawbridge in the entrance into your fortress from the caverns, with lockable doors on both sides of it, you could just keep a careful eye on the current population of the caverns and have your dwarves flee inside if anything dangerous appeared.

"uberdrivers","t5_2yzxz","Your interpretation is skewed by your desire to be right.

There are 20 questions utilized by various state &amp; federal taxing authorities to make a determination of IC v. Employee. 

While there are groupings to help them understand where the line is, it should be clearly understood that no answer is completely right or wrong, it is a judgement based on all the answers.

This public memo of guidance from Oregon DOR uses language that is more understandable.

https://www.oregon.gov/ODA/shared/Documents/Publications/NaturalResources/20FactorTestforIndependentContractors.pdf

Notice the phrasing: indicates a possible , suggests an employee relationship, ""likely to be"" considered etc, etc and it goes on.

Your statement here is substantially correct:

""A worker qualifies as an IC under the test the IRS and many other government agencies use only if the worker -- not the hiring firm -- has the right to control the manner and means by which he or she does the job.""

However, you are not using the proper resolution. Nobody is telling you how to do your job. They are saying if you want to apply up to a $150 fine against your customer, you need to submit proof (as always) but now they want to see a receipt - which is perfectly legit.

As I stated earlier, requiring a receipt (IMHO) does not jeopardize the IC relationship - but now if they demanded that only cleanings and receipts issued by THEIR depots were acceptable, that MAY ""suggest"" or may ""likely to be"" a POSSIBLE indicator of a employee relationship.

It takes more than ONE of these ""possible likely indicators"" to tick the scale all the over. 

It's not ONE AND DONE. You don't get to point and scream 'THEY TELLIN ME WHAT TO DO n THATS ILLEGAL! THEY MAKING ME AN EMPLOYEE OVER HERE!'

No, they are not. If it went to tax court, you wouldn't get in the front door with this, They would kick it back with a sticky note - ARE YOU KIDDING US WITH THIS? GTFO.

Source: about 100 years combined experience on our senior staff. I've been in the biz since 1997 myself and have had Collegiate postgrad level discussions on the subject with retired IRS directors of collection and other department heads. They shrug and sigh and say their hands are tied by the folks that write the laws. 

Those folks get rich before and after their terms in Congress working for the (uber)rich (lol) folks to devise those tax avoidance strategies and if you can afford to hire them, they can show you how the folks in at Mossack* pulled it off.

Here is a copy of the original post:

 

I recently ran into some money issues the last couple of months. Basically short version of the story is that I lost my job at work, and the only money we had coming in was my husbands check. We had to move into his parents house to get caught up with bills. Everything was going great got a new higher paying job and started getting caught up on bills. Then we started looking for an apartment and found a nice one in a area we like.

But with of our bad luck as soon as we were about to pay the deposit the guy rents it too another person. So back to square one again, found a nice place about to apply there. I get a letter from a debt collector saying my wages are going to get garished for 1200 dollars we paid some money towards it to stop the garnish but it did not work. So basically they started garnishing my check 25 percent. So my husband got a upwork job to help with bills and we are on the right track now and have found a place to live I Cape Girardeau, MO so my husband can go to school.

I am asking for a small loan to help with a deposit and some moving expenses so need about 360 and willing to pay back 430 back starting in February with weekly payments if anyone could help us out we will be very thankful for the assistance. (Sorry about the formatting, typed this from my phone)

Just because something is bad doesn't mean it couldn't get worse. Most unqualified people have little or no regard for even basic standards for justice like the presumption of innocence. Seriously look at any post on social media at all about a criminal getting life in prison and there will be an endless stream of well liked comments calling to get rid of due process and torture the criminal to death instead.

&gt; at least with no cops, no one is there to lie about you or plant evidence on you

In my experience with anarchists, that's not what most of them advocate for. Most advocate for distributing the authority that the police have evenly among the community, which imo directly contradicts their criticisms of authority, as it does leave people who could lie about you and get you in more trouble than you need to be in, and retains everything they hate about authority except the lack of democracy.",1546300865

A fetus is a fetus, regardless of how it's conceived.

You don't have the right to cherry pick your beliefs and apply them to half the population like that.

Also, any pregnancy is very punishing. My first child broke my tailbone, which I still have severe pain from 4 years post partum. My second tore me terribly and I healed with granulated tissue. 18 months post partum I still can't stomach sex without pre-emptive pain meds and a lot of wine.

"SelfDrivingCars","t5_2udmw","&gt;	Yep, all good products. But the tech behind it never was Apple's. Same for Lisa's GUI.

That's hardly a counter argument...  The tech behind these products were the result of research made at Apple by very talented people who are considered to this day leaders in their field.  Apple GUI were years ahead.  They were the first to do extensive human research in human computer interface and target the general public as their user and not only PHDs like Xerox implementation at the time.  Their graphics capabilities were also much more advanced.  

&gt;	ARM are nice, but that hardly makes them a leader in IC or CPU tech.

Funny since their SoC achievements were greatly achieved thanks to Jim Keller which became the greatest authority in microprocessor engineering after his work at AMD and Apple.  This guy is considered the clear leader in his field and so is Apple in mobile SoC (Phones, tablets, watches, etc.)

&gt;	But Waymo is sure a great example, they are way ahead of the competition in their field. 

By this metric Apple have been considered years ahead in many fields.  Waymo has been using and is still using tech that already exist, like all company do.

If you check my post history I answered this question for someone over in /WTF a while back.

Salient points:

The three auto manufacturers I mentioned above build automobiles that are extremely reliable, and typically less expensive to fix than european automobiles (assuming you live in the United States). Domestic cars are definitely better than they used to be, but in my experience it is extremely hard to beat the three manufacturers I listed in terms of reliability.

Buy a used car with a good service history. A new car loses an alarming amount of value the moment you drive it off of a dealers lot. Don't be the guy to take that hit. There are way better things to spend your money on versus a depreciating automobile.

‚ÄúWe Own the Night‚Äù is really the song that brought them popularity, as you can tell by all of the listens across each streaming service. Mothership improved on the success of Instant Gratification, and this is around the time you really started to see their shows with more DGD fans. This is clearly visible in the number of plays their Mothership album had, which finally overshadowed a lot of their previous work with respect to listens.

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","&gt;You rarely pip while camping but anyway that LF is probably camping to derank or simply be toxic. 

You admit that it is toxic, and no they camp because they learned it can work.

&gt;They get free points for no effort so how is their experience ruined? Yes they will lose points on benevolent but they will get all other emblems maxed.

They can get at most 8k points from doing gens and 5 k points from escaping. Not only is doing only gens boring, but after getting 8k from the gens they arent getting points unless they escape. If killer wasnt camping they could be getting boldness, objective, survival, and cooperative points for the same amount of time that game is going on. Youll lose points on benevolent.....and you won't gain points in the evader category. ""All other emblems will be maxed"" is just wrong.

&gt;Most killers camp because they are annoyed at the certain survivor or need a kill so losing points is a bad thing and the minority of killers who camp with no reason are the ones who benefit from this. 

See that's a problem. Killers shouldn't be able to camp someone because they're just annoyed, at that point it isnt much of a strategy and it's more of a ""you annoy me so I'll annoy you"" and camping is often justified with excuses like ""you used ds"" or ""you flashlight saved someone"". They lose points towards pips, not bp. And again, PIPPING IS USELESS. People who camp ""for no reason"" often camp to troll, that shouldn't be a thing.

&gt;Yes it can be used to troll but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not a strategy. 

In my opinion, if a strategy can be considered trolling by more than a few salty individuals then it shouldn't be a strategy/it shouldn't work. That's a problem that needs to be addressed",1546300870

It can be used in so many ways i probably havent even discovered half of it and i only use smoke grenades ^^^^and ^^^^gas. The basic principle is a visible barrier can help both offensively and defensively. Smoking an enemy position will not allow them to shoot accurately from their position, they have to relocate or risk being overrun by enemies they cannot see before it is too late. Defensively they can be used to cover the enemies line of sight so they blindly run through the smoke to find an enemy line (preferably LMG)

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","I believe the metaphor of being untouched by the hand of man as natural, can be safely extended into the immediate presence of humans without resorting to self hatred. Natural implies ""Nature as we find it"". Certainly we arose within nature (be it by process or function regardless) and are therefore by definition within this understanding of definitional context, ""Natural"" as well. Be that as it may, a typical understanding of the definition of the word natural would be ""untouched nature"", with the typical ""understander"" not holding contrarian notions regarding the validity of the epistemological basis on which the concept of ""natural"" is formed. There is no absurdity in valuing regenerative ecological process over the wanton destruction of bio-diversity at the hand of man, nor in calling one natural and the other not. The absurdity lies in the assertion that those two processes are somehow equal in anyway; somehow able to balance one another, when so clearly at this point in history, that is an entirely false assumption. What draws the contempt here is the lack of concept of responsibility. Easy enough to engineer a dam that allows fish to spawn, easy enough to not dump toxic waste in the river but very hard to pay for that dam or change the dumpers ways without incentive.

You should go to a local hockey store and see if they can fit you for skates.  Skates are different sizing than your street shoe so this is your best bet on getting something that fits. Several new players on my college team bought skates online that were way too big and it seriously hindered their skating ability.

When you‚Äôre just learning how to skate, really any hockey skate is fine as long as it‚Äôs comfortable and fits. When you get into playing hockey, you probably want to spend in the $150-200 range for junior skates and $200-300 range for senior skates for a little added padding. Your average beer league does not need top of the line skates, especially if you are small like me and really do not benefit all that much from a stiffer carbon fiber boot. 

Used skates are great too. They‚Äôre cheaper and if you have small feet you can get away with some really nice gently used skates that someone‚Äôs kid grew out of in half a season. :)",1546300873

While it might seem counterintuitive to wear tight leggings, they act similar to Spanx really - hug everything in a little and ""shape"" you.  Then a looser shirt over top hides any lumps and bumps and jiggles, and you still look ""put together"" rather than like you're just wearing sacks.  Sometimes I feel like going overboard wearing loose clothing and stuff trying to hide your body actually draws more attention.  Plus it's a safety hazard if everything is big and loose, you risk tripping, getting caught in machines/on stuff, etc.  There's multiple reasons a lot of athletic wear is tight, safety being a big one.

Quite frankly though, it's really true that the majority of gym goers won't even look at you, and if they do it's mostly positive thoughts - hey that person is trying to better themselves, good for them.  Personally, I'm focused on my own workout, I really don't have time to give a damn what other people are doing in the gym unless it's SUPER ridiculous and attention drawing, like the obnoxious meatheads that grunt AS LOUDLY AS POSSIBLE while doing their bicep curls and such.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","Before working at a hospital I might have a agreed with the comments about them knowing what they are getting into. I mean, you are not wrong, they did know what they were signing up for.

That being said, I think its really important that patients that are admitted to the hospital have as many things to keep their spirits up as possible. Many people are admitted for long periods of time and even IF they have family/friends that visit, the visits are often few and far between. Without visitors or TV, there is almost nothing to do and usually nobody to talk to. The rooms are rarely private, but you don't get to choose your roommate. They may or may not be able to communicate with you, and you may not even get along with them if you did.

Additionally,to address those that argue that they should just bring in their own devices, I think you should consider the age and condition of people that are admitted. If you are actually admitted into the hospital, you are VERY sick. In most cases you are also very old. Most people are hooked up to a wide variety of medical devices and have limited mobility. Some are just elderly and shaky. Some are just so old, that learning to use tablet with Netflix might be a bit of a stretch.

Hospital stays are extremely unpleasant, even with the best nurses and hospital staff caring for you. Its hard to sleep, you are constantly being interrupted for monitoring, medication, blood test etc, there are always noises (and those noises are almost never pleasant). 

I honestly think people would recover faster and have shorter hospital stays if they had a better environment. If TV is the one escape from their illness and chaotic environment, I think an effort should be made to make it a bit more affordable.",1546300873

"aww","t5_2qh1o","They're the best dogs. My sister had 3, all so amazing. Blue was the biggest and my BF's 3 lb mini Yorkie used to play / tease Blue, grab his ears, etc and Blue was so gentle the way he played back with just his snoot and paw, and little nudges. He knew that Spike was just a little thing but super playful and totally unaware of her size. So he was sweet and patient.

Jessie was super lovey and gentle, totally obedient, and kind of smallish for shepherd. She was asleep in the back of my sister's car, window down, in the fall cool and breezy outside. We went in the store for a quick errand, came back to the car, hopped in. A guy reached into my sister's window and grabbed her purse. Mostly, he started us, so we both screamed. Jessie lunged out of the back seat window, straight at the guy took him down, stood on top of him, mouth at his throat, snarling, growling, teeth bared. She never bit him, but she didn't let him up either until cops arrived and my sister called her off. Once he was cuffed and taken away, Jessie wagged and wiggled and smiled like she was the best, goodest girl ever.

My sister had never trained her to do anything like that, nor had she ever seen Jessie do anything aggressive before. She just instinctively protected us (really my sister), but did not actually bite, just held the guy looking all scary and fierce. 

I swear, a couple of times her eyes shifted to my sister. It looked like she was asking. My sister just nodded. She said later, ""if I had said, 'GET HIM!' I think she would have attacked, bitten him, torn him up. If I said that, with heightened emotion, she would have gone for it. But she looked at me did you see her? I stayed steady and so she held back, held steady. It's like she was asking me what to do.""

I think she was right. Amazing dogs. They read us. No training. But that dog knew my sister. ",1546300875

&gt;* Question the existence of God (Refuting watchmaker theory, refuting intelligent design, refuting fine-tuning)

&gt;*  Question Islam

&gt;*  Question Ahmadiyyat

My personal advice would be to shy away from arguments about the existence of a divine being (or multiple divine beings) because there is no way to scope such a discussion - it's a lot better to focus on Islam's definition of what a divine being is (i.e. Allah) and talk to his general characterization - belief in a deity is orthogonal to religion, so it's important to disassociate the two and make it clear that your issues root from Islam/Ahmadiyyat rather than challenge the existence of a deity (this conversation will go nowhere since neither party has anything concrete to offer outside of philosophical arguments)

--------------------------------------

In terms of questioning Islam and Ahmadiyyat, I'll primarily point you to existing resources I've shared with this sub before - note that I agree with /u/ultraman66 that you should focus on concrete pieces of information such as the Quran and direct sayings, instead of prophecies/metaphorical verses that are easier to deflect under ambiguous interpretation:

# Questioning Islam

### 1) [Women in the Quran](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/is-the-quran-from-god-an-assessment-of-the-divinity-in-the-quran/#11) and [Women in Islam](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/message-to-my-family-why-i-have-left-islam/#11)

* For this section, you want to focus on why the Quran never addresses women directly (e.g. it talks to men about whom they can marry and who they can marry their daughters off to, but women themselves are never spoken to directly), you want to ask about all the assymetric treatment verses (wife-beating, half inheritance, two witnesses etc.), ask about why angels cannot be female (or more importantly, why are they gendered to begin with)

### 2) [Muhammad in the Quran](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/07/05/is-the-quran-from-god-an-assessment-of-the-divinity-in-the-quran/#11) and [Muhammad in Islam](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/message-to-my-family-why-i-have-left-islam/#10)

* Here, you can choose to ask about all the special treatments Muhammad receives (e.g. multiple wives, Allah threatening his wives, Allah telling his guests to leave his house etc.), his marriage to Zainab (i.e. changing the implication of adoption so he could marry her - ask the Imam why this mattered so much), his marriage to Saffiya (how does marrying an 18 year old after killing her family seem honorable), his moments of questionable morality (stoning adulterers, breaking idols etc.), and the general discussion on Hadiths (there is no single source of truth, so which Hadiths *actually are true*? - You can share some of the Hadiths I've posted and ask that Muslims believe Muhammad based on a subset of them but the lack of standards to determine what's authentic or not makes it impossible to know which view is validated)

### 3) Quran

* You should ask general questions on why the Quran is repetitive, full of othering, contains no original narrative (e.g. why does it talk about the same prophets from the Old Testament instead of talking about prophets such as Krishna - that would have been a perfect opportunity for Allah to have shown people from India that he knew of knowledge no one else should have known). 

* You could ask about how no one uses the Quran to inform their behaviour and actions - it's not a book of moral guidance that tells you *how to live life* (and here, you want to ask about things such as the limited scope of ethics discussed in the book, why it chooses to focus on describing Houris instead of how to treat your spouses, why it doesn't talk about effective administration instead opting to telling men when they can have sex etc.)

* You can also ask about some of the problematic issues ingrained in the Quran (slavery, violent verses, talk of people like Moses and Abraham whose existences have yet to be confirmed, accepting responsibility for enabling groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS - here, you want to draw parallels on the logic employed by Muslims where they blame alcohol for causing alcoholism and that if you're qualifying something around extremes, it's only fair to contextualize the Quran based on extremists)

# Questioning Ahmadiyyat

### 1) [Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/message-to-my-family-why-i-have-left-islam/#4)

* The best resource for this is still Nuzhat Haneef's book but you can ask about specifics such as his inconsistency (how does he go from telling Sunnis that anyone who claims prophethood is not Muslim to declaring prophethood for himself), his foul language, his English revelations from Allah, [the preface to Braheen-e-Ahmadiyya](https://old.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya/comments/9qi03z/braheeneahmadiya_vol5_in_english_for_the_first/e8aa9up/)

### 2) [Ahmadiyya Leadership](https://dreamedofyou.wordpress.com/2018/08/23/message-to-my-family-why-i-have-left-islam/#5)

* Ask about enforcing purdah, misunderstood evolution, sexist rulings (e.g. you *actually can beat your wife*, according to KMIV), promoting pseudo-science such as homeopathy, antisemitic statements from KMIV, [harsh writings from KMII on Christianity](https://old.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya/comments/8zopqj/the_hypocrisy_of_muslims_criticizing_other/) and how we'd never publicly tell the world we think the bible is a fairy tale but we do that behind closed doors - the definition of hypocrisy, 

### 3) Treatment of Women

* I think [this thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/islam_ahmadiyya/comments/9pw2qr/my_first_post_in_this_sub_why_women_cant_give_a/) has good discussion points to jump on

---------------------------------

&gt;I'm trying my best to go into the debate with a strong hand, so that I can get the Imam to a point where he can't answer my questions any more, and on some level, to prove that my position is a reasonable one whereas Ahmadiyyat is not.

A last piece of advice on this is: the Imam will always think he's right - your goal should not be to make Ahmadiyyat look questionable because he would never accept such a position. Rather, you should simply showcase that you have your own set of values and there are things about Islam/Ahmadiyyat that don't align with the way you think a fair religion should have been organized according to your own definition of fairness. Try to get into a position where despite him disagreeing with everything you'll say (and if he's like most Imams, he will have to disagree with all that you're saying since acknowledgement implies imperfection), he can understand why you are making this choice for yourself

-------------------------------------------------------

for some encouragement, I'll share an email I received after telling an Imam that I've decided to leave Islam and hope that your Imam will extend the same understanding:

&gt; My dear brother, while I'm naturally very pained at hearing of this news, I applaud your personal investigation. I pray that Allah enables you to see absolute truth, and that in the end, your heart is lead to whatever the truth is. 

&gt; You know, we both are lovers of humanity, and as such, we both want what is best for it. The good thing is that both my belief and your belief is that mankind must work together and serve each other toward mutual betterment. 

&gt; I wish you the best of luck with your endeavours in Seattle! I can't wait to see the amazing things you will achieve in the future. If ever there is anything I can do for you brother, please do not hesitate to call me. Any time, any day; and I mean that literally! ",1546300875

I've gone to the doctor with unique, textbook symptoms of a pretty serious and contagious virus, and they sent me home with antibiotics. Went back later when I wasn't better and they tested me, and before I even came back positive they had me off campus and under quarantine and I got multiple calls from the cdc and emails went out to the entire campus. When my mom (a doctor) found out what symptoms I'd gone in with she about ripped the doctor who saw me a new one. Later found out I'd stared a whole outbreak on my campus because I continued to go to class and they'd just kept it under the radar. 

I've gone to a specialist with textbook symptoms of a disorder he's supposed to recognize. He said basically said ""maybe probably, you definitely have textbook symptoms, but it's not worth getting tested so I'll just diagnose you with fibromyalgia"" note, a fibro diagnosis specifically required ruling out the thing I still think I actually have with testing. He also said if I have what I have, physical therapy won't work even though all resources I've found and also all other doctors I've seen agreed it's the *main treatment*. My doctor no longer refers patients there 

I've had a doctor tell me that even though I have chronic back pain that prevents me from doing just about everything even though I'm 21 (20 at the time) he won't do imaging because ""i don't know what it is and doesn't doesn't sound like any problem I know of so why would I do imaging?"" as if you only get imaging when you already know what the problem is

I've had doctors order tests that I don't need just to make them money. I'm talking"" we've found the problem so let's cancel your tests that are happening at other facilities but I still want to keep the ones that I'll be performing (and getting paid for) just to be on the safe side""

Another time I had a glass of wine (about half full) and topped it up with ice because it‚Äôs summer here and it was nice to sip and feel like I was drinking with everyone while only having such a tiny amount and as the ice melted it kept the glass looking full so I could decline a top up too ",1546300877

"SmashBrosUltimate","t5_kcmhp","No, I get you. it definitely has it, like pretty much all modern video games. But this game did not grow on sex appeal, nor was that ever its intention. A lot of games are for the aesthetic atmosphere, but smash is 99.9% about its gameplay techniques.

I don‚Äôt think  I‚Äôve ever heard someone mention the attractiveness of any character at a smash tourney. It‚Äôs essentially tech/gameplay but talk.

The original smash had no female characters (despite Samus being in the suit), and the closest male sex appeal I guess you could get was captain falcon?

The only time I‚Äôve ever heard someone speak of sex appeal in smash (generally speaking) was when zero suit was introduced.

This being said, I play online almost every day and go to a fair amount of tourneys so I can speak for this.

Basically I‚Äôm saying sex appeal is a given despite any type of media, if there‚Äôs a human, it‚Äôll have sex appeal. It is not a game specific thing. It‚Äôs just like every other thing.

*****
&gt; The footage - broadcast by A-Haber on Sunday night - shows a group of men, some very well-dressed, carrying three suitcases and two big black bags from a car into the residence of the Saudi consul general in Istanbul on October 2, the day Khashoggi was killed inside the consulate, just hundreds of meters away.

&gt; Khashoggi entered the embassy in order to prepare documents for his planned marriage but was confronted by a group of more than a dozen men sent to Turkey from Saudi Arabia to slay him.

&gt; The Saudis initially claimed that he left the building unharmed but eventually said Khashoggi was killed in a &amp;quot;Rogue operation.&amp;quot; Reportedly, the CIA and other Western entities say that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, or MBS, ordered the hit on Khashoggi.

Another pro-tip, modulate the mix of this plugin with your DAW to fine tune the attack and release when sidechain. It gives much more control than using the plugin itself.

Since the EQ is dynamic, you can have anything you want sidechained going to one bus. I have my kick, snares, and toms input into this plugin and the EQ adjusts to cut out only what's needed. Very nice having just one bus handle everything.",1546300880

Cheers

I'm not disagreeing with that. But the reality of the situation right now is that universal health care doesn't exist. So amongst the choices of ""be broke,""  ""buy insurance,""  or ""rely on universal health care,""  the only feasible ones for Americans right now is the middle one. Which is why I recommended it, and got roundly shot down for being realistic.

You don't have to argue the benefits of universal health care with me, as I agree with them. I also watched your video and found it informative but irrelevant to the question of whether universal health care will pay for your medical bills if you get in a car accident in America with an uninsured driver.

What I disagree with is that you should lobby your government in preference to buying an insurance policy.",1546300881

And global sports like soccer are just way less entrenched (to give some perspective Everton and Liverpool football clubs, famous rivals were founded in the late 1800s...)

And the Cold War is over, it's no longer as important to see some red-blooded  American beat the shit out of some poor commie and act like it was another step to winning the battle for the fate of the world :P

&amp;#x200B;

The article uses the term ""disk"", and ""Hard Drive"" interchangeably, which is technically incorrect, it's just that people are just so used to using the term ""disk"" as short for HDD that they conflated the term disk with hard drive.

&amp;#x200B;

The article itself is a little misleading, as it's true that a user simply putting stuff on their hard drive near-capacity isn't going to cause much of a problem, since it's hard to get every last bit of space just by downloading files...usually there's still going to be just enough space left over.  If you try and install a 45GB game and you have 30GB left over, you still have over 16GB left over for everything your OS needs to do and will likely only have small amounts of slowdown due to fragmentation.  The problem arises when a process, such as the logs that OP is talking about, that fill every last bit of the drive, leaving 0GB left over for anything.

My biggest hope for FEH in the coming year, now that beasts have been comfirmed, is getting that good ol' Legendary Seliph or finally having Patty and Fee  ~~and Rinea~~ implemented! I don't know which one will come first, but I'm happy to wait for them as long as it takes. While I'm hoping for them, have some of my favourite first gen characters enjoying the New Year.

If you're wondering, Tailtiu and Silvia got a whole bunch of fortunes. They're giving the best ones to Sigurd and Deirdre because dammit, they deserve it. Regardless of what luck the future holds, I'm looking forward to it, and I hope everyone reading here has a lovely start to 2019! Happy New Year!",1546300884

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","Tldr - 39 hour labor, 31 unmedicated at home, transferred for epidural and nap, needed vacuum assistance, overall very positive even if not to ""the plan!""

Thursday December 6th I was 41 + 4 and becoming convinced I'd need an induction or at the very least a stretch &amp; sweep along with herbs from my midwife at my appointment scheduled for the next day. 

After nearly 2 weeks of trying every possible old wives tale to get her moving (spicy curry, eggplant, lots of walking, sex...) I had given up on spontaneous labor and stayed up until midnight playing animal crossing on my phone. I think things would have gone differently if I had gone to bed earlier. 

At 2 am, after only two hours of sleep, I woke up to a strong sensation of pressure in my lower belly and attempted to run to the bathroom. I barely made it through the door when my waters broke with a surprisingly small ""gush"". I only knew it was my waters because my plug came away with it. 

I wasn't having any contractions at this point, so I cleaned myself up, told my husband what was happening and attempted to go back to sleep. As soon as I laid down though, contractions started like strong period cramps every 10 minutes. I tried to sleep through them but it was too difficult so I got up and got in the shower hoping the hot water would help me relax. 

The shower felt amazing and I stayed in until the water started cooling off. Contractions were very manageable and still 7 to 10 minutes apart, so I moved to the living room, sat on my birth ball, and attempted to watch The Office. My husband woke up at this point and began covering all the windows with blankets and taped paper over the clocks so I could lose track of time and just be in ""labor land"". This was an amazing decision and the only reason I think I was able to labor at home as long as I did. 

After a couple episodes of The Office, contractions were becoming strong enough that I needed to stop and breathe through them and my husband helped a lot by massaging my back or squeezing my hips. So we turned off Netflix, turned off all the lights and set up battery tea light candles around the house. I moved to the couch on a pile of towels &amp; a puppy pad, and managed to snooze between contractions because I was feeling rather tired at this point. 

A few hours later the midwife (and her assistant) showed up to check my progress and I was at 4 cm and nearly fully effaced. This should have been encouraging, but I was SO. TIRED. and I'm pretty sure it'd been roughly 12 hours or so at this point, so I was really hoping to be further along. The midwives said I was making great progress and told my husband to keep them updated. 

The next several hours are a blur of me being in &amp; out of the shower (the shower helped a ton), and on the couch attempting to nap between contractions. I was breathing through each one and my husband was right there timing them or reminding me to drink water and sip on a protein smoothie to keep my energy up. 

At some point the midwives returned and I declined a cervical check as I didn't want to be discouraged. They set up the birth pool and I began using it as well as the shower for relief. Contractions at this point were 3 to 5 mins apart, lasting a minute to 2 mins, and strong enough that I had to stand and rock through each one while blowing air through my lips like a horse. I'm not sure why this happened, but my body just took over and I couldn't stop. I tried to focus on remaining relaxed and loose through each one. 

While I was in the birth pool, I felt the contractions change and felt my body needing to push with each one. I told the midwives I was pushing and asked if that was ok. They told me to listen to my body and let it do what it was doing, but don't add any force just yet. I stayed in the pool doing just that for a while. Swaying back and forth on all fours, blowing through my lips, and occasionally pressing my forehead against the side of the pool. 

The midwives had me get out after a while and checked my cervix. I was 10 cm, fully effaced, and ready to push! I got a burst of energy from this news. Finally - we are near the end! 

We moved into my bedroom for coached pushing since I wasn't effectively pushing on my own. As a ftm I found it took a while to get the technique right. I pushed for four hours at home but my baby wasn't moving down. Her head was sideways and I was too tired to produce the force needed to move her past my pubic bone. We tried laying on my back, on each side, the birth stool, all fours, etc. The midwives had me marching through my apartment in an attempt to have gravity help me but nothing seemed to be working. 

My midwife had been carefully watching baby and I for signs of anything going wrong, so thankfully the hospital transfer was an option at this point and not emergent. She told me I could continue to try for an hour if I wanted, but if I hadn't moved her by then we should consider the hospital. 

My husband and I talked it over and I decided to transfer and get the epidural solely to take a nap before becoming a mom. So we transferred, I got a very light epidural (could still move my legs and feet, and contractions now felt like period cramps), I took a nap for about 6 hours and woke up ready to try pushing again. 

Ultimately we ended up needing vacuum assistance to turn her head as I pushed and at 5:53 pm on December 8th my little girl was born. 

It was a long 39 hour labor - 31 of which were unmedicated. I'm a little sad we didn't get our home birth, but only because I had wanted my husband to catch her. In the end, we are both healthy, neither of us was ever in any danger, and my birth went smoothly and never felt out of control or scary. That's really all I could ask for.

Bynum never played more than 60 games during this period, missed an entire playoff run, and never played more than 24 mpg. That's a role player. The Lakers often had Rony Turiaf and DJ Mbenga playing minutes because he missed so much time or was so hobbled. 

&gt; Also Kobe‚Äôs TS started declining when Gasol got there. Pau at times kept the offense rolling because was so efficient.

This is patently false. Kobe Bryant's TS% was .580 the season before Pau got there. It was .576 the season Pau got there in 2007-08. His TS% hovered in the same range post-Pau it did before Pau got there with 2011-12 (when Pau had a relative down year himself that year) being an exception because Kobe had a knee injury he didn't deal with til the following offseason. He then jumped back up to .570 in 2012-13 after getting work done on his knee when Pau was having his second consecutive bad season after the Dwight trade. 

Moreover, it's a second option's job to be able to fill in a bit if the no. 1 guy is off. Kobe did that for Shaq all the time. Anyway, the point is that Kobe's production is consistent season to season no matter who is around him. The same cannot be said for Pau who increased his productivity and efficiency after getting to LA. So, it stands to reason that one of these guys benefits more from the other. And it's clearly the guy whose production is less dependent on circumstances and teammates due to being one of the best scorers in NBA history no matter who is on the floor with him.

&gt; THE SOUL SEARCHERS are an eight piece,classic Sixties' style Soul and R&amp;B band complete with horns, dark suits, and energy to spare. They play nothing but the greatest hits of that magical era including those tunes by Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Stevie Wonder, Otis Redding, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Gladys Knight, and virtually every other major Rhythm and Blues artist of the day. 

&gt; What sets THE SOUL SEARCHERS apart from other bands is the level of musicianship and professional experience. The band members are some of Nashville's top players, having played with such well known artists as Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison, Taj Mahal, Wynonna, Dave Mason, Lyle Lovett, and Delbert McClinton. THE SOUL SEARCHERS have also served as legendary guitarist Steve Cropper's back up band on numerous live performances. 

&gt; Featuring male and female vocalists, guitar, keyboards, bass, drums, saxophone, and trumpet. THE SOUL SEARCHERS serve up authentic and high spirited versions of all the best Soul and R&amp;B hits of that golden age: ""Mustang Sally"", ""Sittin' On the Dock of the Bay"", ""My Girl"", etc. Looking sharp in suits and ties, the band is dedicated to inducing audiences to have as much fun listening and dancing to this great music as the band clearly has performing it. THE SOUL SEARCHERS never fail to enjoy a wildly enthusiastic response, whether they are playing a corporate function, a private event or appearing at one of Nashville's hottest nightclubs.

When I graduated in 2008, finding work was not so easy. Now, the only thing that degree did for me was boost me  up to E4 when I enlisted in the Army. My current job doesn't have a thing to do with my degree. It worked out decent in the end, but I wish I hadn't gone with the ""easy"", fun degree back in the day.

Now, I wish I had looked into trade schools back when I was leaving high school. Plumber, electrician, mechanic, welder. Good trades are in demand and won't take 4 years to finish. The apprentice wages are pretty decent. I live in a low cost of living state/area and when I talked to a friend in the wielding business he told me to expect around $15 an hour starting out. Then the longer you're in and the more skilled you become, you may end up earning more quicker depending on what college degree you're going for.",1546300886

You're right, according to most scholarly definitions, taken at face value, CaH is a game (exempting Jesper Juul, whose criteria include caring about the outcome, which leads me to the following point).

But - the scoring mechanism of CaH is totally external and unnecessary to the rest of the game. If you remove it, it won't change how players play or think about the game. You (maybe) enjoy the activity itself, but having an overarching goal is not a real part of CaH. Most of the games I played, nobody counted their ""points"" at the end. As such, I feel it's largely tacked on - only so that it could be called a ""game"". That's why I say it's not a game, at least not in the context of r/boardgames.

Btw. On top of that consider that it doesn't even have a set ending - it ends when people get bored, which is unlike a structured game but quite like the play of children.",1546300887

These programmers are making BOATLOADS more than I did at Best Buy and they get the holidays off? They don‚Äôt even have to deal with us face-to-face like retail employees have to deal with their customers. 

Stop feeling sorry for these guys man. They put out a product right before holidays and abandoned it shortly after. What DUMBASS game company doesn‚Äôt know that there will be a MASSIVE amount of bugs after release. Now, knowing this, you can‚Äôt justify your absence due to it being holiday season. Next time instead of being money-hungry shitheads you should release the game in fucking March so you have a solid six months to address the massive, game-breaking bugs that we have right now. But did you do that? No. You wanted that Black Friday money. 

Any person who defends these big companies is an ass kisser and a sheep. You really want employees to enjoy their holidays?

The entire dark side was maximum cringe, and the story was simultaneously more absurd and took itself more seriously. And most unforgivably, it didn't learn at all from SA1s biggest mistake, the character clutter. It instead doubles down on it, and makes it so you can't even have an uninterrupted Sonic playthrough, makes the other characters less like Sonic, and increases their relative importance (moving them from what was pretty much bonus content to front and center missions). 

I liked SA1, warts and all, when it came out, but by SA2 the writing was on the wall that Sonic Team wasn't going to really learn from their mistakes. SA1 was a gleeful mess of ideas no matter how off the wall, which was classic Sega (and I mean that in a loving way).

""His brain wasn't fully developed"" 

Being 17 and 364 days old vs. 18 years old isn't going to do much to the brain, just saying. This cunt was a cunt period. He wasn't going to have an epiphany on his 18th birthday.

He did deserve life, but he didn't deserve a second chance at life after his transgressions. The heart donated was wasted, literally. He got a second chance even though he had a history of ""non-compliance"" (as in he didn't follow a medical physicians instructions).

Another person in the thread commented:

&gt;Federal records show that 3,400 people were on waiting lists for heart transplants in 2012, but only 2,000 of these procedures were performed. While waiting for a heart transplant, 331 people died.

So you know what yeah fuck this kid, he did not deserve the heart, he did not deserve the second chance provided to him. I'm certain that most of the 331 that died were more deserving.

"DebateAVegan","t5_2sa7z","&gt;I very strongly disagree here. I think harming sentient beings unnecessarily is morally wrong in and of itself. If you do not need to cause suffering, then surely causing suffering to any being for any reason is the wrong path to take, no?

No.  Well, just saying ""no"" is a bit extreme of course.  But basically, I don't pre-suppose that the suffering of all sentient beings has inherent moral value.

Just like most vegans would say that animals lives are worth *less* than ours, I just go one step farther and say they don't have moral value.  Killing animals is amoral in the same way that harvesting crops is amoral.  My conception of rights isn't based on sentience or suffering, it's based on the hypothetical agreement between rational agents discussed in the OP and in other replies.

So for me, the barrier of ""need to cause suffering"" is much lower, because the suffering doesn't inherently have moral value, it's just an experience that occurs.

I look at it kind of like spraying pesticides on crops.  Most vegans and I would agree that insects at least aren't deserving of moral rights.  So despite the fact that pesticides harm and often kill vast numbers of insects, that's seen as morally irrelevant to the question of whether to treat crops or not.  I would see the same kind of thing when it comes to farming animals for meat.

Just like we want crops, and don't mind killing insects to do it, we want meat, and don't mind killing animals to do it.

This sounds super harsh and callous of course if you're coming from the vegan perspective, but I'm using a different moral system, and it's not some ""evil"" system that's just bad through and through.  Contractualism provides a very strong sense of rights that arguably obligates us to treat one another *far* better than we do in current society.  I just draw the line of ""which entities get rights"" differently.

&gt;I would also add that most farmers in my area are fairly isolated, and so would have less opportunity to express violence towards other humans. 

Certainly rural life is more isolated than city life, but my understanding is most farms are a group effort, even if it's just one family.  I'm sure there are ""wild men"" that live off the land totally alone, but most farms are corporate enterprises these days (and thus are massive and tended by large numbers of people), and those that aren't still present more work than just one person could reliably do, I think.

&gt;Farmers are also generally quite wealthy (particularly when compared with slaughterhouse workers) and it is well documented that poverty correlates with increased violence.

I agree that compared to slaughterhouse workers farmers probably qualify as wealthy, and corporations like Monsanto certainly are incredibly rich, but most small farmers actually have a very tough time financially speaking.  Sure they technically own capital in the form of the farm itself and the machinery and stuff (to what extent they own the machinery, I think these days it's usually leased), but the margins are also very small and often farmers struggle to make ends meet.  [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/a8jnk7/worlds_first_nokill_eggs_go_on_sale_in_berlin/ecbueku/?context=2) I ran into yesterday actually shows what I'm talking about a lot, in the context of chicken farmers.

Also I certainly agree about the correlation between poverty and violence, and under my conception of morality the inequality that drives poverty *cough*capitalism*cough* would be inherently wrong and thus the existence of poverty is immoral in and of itself.

&gt;For me though, the meat industry will always require violence towards animals (both physical and emotional violence), and that is sufficient evidence for me to know that I do not wish to contribute to that particular industry.

And that's perfectly fair and reasonable from the perspective of a moral system founded on the principle of minimizing the suffering of sentient beings.  I just don't share that moral system.

&gt;This is not the reality of the industry you are contributing to. Slaughterhouses require physical labour, so by adding to their demand you are in turn adding to the frequency of negative psychological impact on slaughterhouse workers.

Increasing automation would reduce the need for physical labor, and I'm not advocating for ""adding to the demand"".  I don't want to force people to eat meat, I just don't consider eating meat morally wrong.

And there's also the difference between ""pure theory"" and ""impure reality"".  The pure theory says that humans working in slaughterhouses leads to violent behavior and thus should be eliminated, but the impure reality is that I can't snap my fingers and magically change it instantly.  There are practical/pragmatic considerations to take into account, which is why rather than saying ""shut down all slaughterhouses until they can be fully automated"", I'd accept the pragmatic compromise of ""keep them running and work to provide more support for slaughterhouse workers, and work to automate more of the process to involve as few humans as possible"".

&gt;Maybe not, but the industry is inescapably violent towards animals and necessitates their being killed, so unless you have a remarkably good reason for completely disregarding any harm caused to other sentient beings I don't see this as particularly relevant.

I mean, that's basically what I was laying out in the OP.  The basic foundation of a moral system that provides a solid justification for the idea of rights based on rational contract deliberation, and how that results in most or all animals being excluded from the concept of rights.",1546300889

"depressionregimens","t5_37a9h","The problem with that study (in reference to ADs, anyway) is that there's no control group, who's to say the anti-depressants had anything to do with people getting remission? The other problem with any sort of study like this is the selection of participants. Perhaps there's a certain kind of depressed person that seeks to participate in such a study. If all those people have depression that is situationally rooted, perhaps very few would actually achieve remission, because for most, nothing actually changed other than time. There's other studies that show ADs only outperforming placebos by a small margin.

Regardless, I think my depression is largely situational, and the mental aspect is never going to be dramatically changed without my situation changing. I do wish ADs helped with the physical symptoms though. The guinea pig feeling of taking them is terrible. Even with only 1 it sucks, but some people are on such a seemingly-random cocktail of these drugs they have no idea what is doing what.",1546300889

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

&gt; Ca Staff with files from NTV. Published Monday, December 31, 2018 12:54PM EST. Updated Monday, December 31, 2018 2:12PM EST. A flight from Canada to Switzerland was diverted and delayed due to the actions of an allegedly unruly passenger.

&gt; James Cadigan of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary says police officers were called to meet the diverted flight &amp;quot;Due to an intoxicated and disruptive passenger.""

&gt; A passenger on the Air Canada flight, Sarah Henshaw, said the man in question was sitting three rows ahead of her.

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","Also a veteran... not sure when you served but I can criticize Trump and Republicans plenty. I didn't vote for Trump and was worried when he won because I kept hearing it and reading things from both sides that conflicted. It was the Democrats that drove me away and ""redpilled"" me. I am a bisexual Navajo-Jew, father of 2 and foster father of 2 wonderful Guatemalen children brought in illegally by the Mexican cartel whose lives were saved by the Zero Tolerance policy. I am still a registered Democrat and pray every day for a Democratic candidate who can and would fulfill the false promises of equality and prosperity for everyone. It pisses me off that Trump is doing more to help minorities, veterans, and the LGBTQ communuty than any other President has done in my lifetime and yet even though it should be common knowledge (and would be if it were any other president) it usn't because rather than Democrats simply taking accountability for fucking up by counting on identity politics for an easy Clinton win (who actually IS in Putin's pocket btw) they decided that rather than come clean when he won and restructure their strategy they were going to double down and activate whatever Manchurian system they used to convince people not only that orange man is bad but that anyone who supports him deserves to be attacked mercilessly and called a faggot, a native nigger, a nazi, and every other racist/bigot/anti-semitic thing you can think of and still pretend that they aren't the racist bigots that are ruining America. The media has convinced people that making America great is somehow a BAD THING for Christ's sake... I worked in counter intelligence for 6 years and it's super fucking obvious how it is happening and working to anyone who just opens their eyes and looks. The system is rigged to destroy the Republic of Freedoms we created with total government control under the guise of Democracy which is actually a system of victimization and oppression. They sell you a bill of goods by creating a problem and offering a solution that requires no logic or accountability.

Trump is a fucking joke but the sad thing is that he is the best President we could have possibly ended up with and that is the fault of the Democrats and they continue to let him win by fighting against him and expecting a different result. If Dems were smart not trying to brain wash everyone and really wanted a better president they would all go total pro-Trump, watch him wallow in his own hubris and let the GOP and his ego implode simaltaneously. Everyone sucks right now but I was betrayed by friends and family alike for simply not hating Trump. Blaming Trump is what an idiot would do.",1546300892

Furthermore, your entire argument is moot, I've explained to you why it's moot, and you keep on ignoring the fact that it's moot, so I'm just going to ask you to outright answer the question:

&amp;#x200B;

Why does it matter? Why does the fact that level 50 MSQ--quests that originally didn't give any exp at all, because at that time, 50 was the level cap, and are therefore balanced around you being level 50-- ""prevents"" you from getting your level 51 skills, and ""doesn't give you enough exp"" matter, when the content that you're doing all syncs you to level 50 anyway? What, exactly, do you need those skills for? Why do you need to be that high level? Even once you get to HW, this continues to be the case until you finally get to the point where the MSQ catches up with your level.",1546300894

its usually pretty easy to double up on them tables lotso f player go all in with like AJ AT etc so if you get a good hand youll get called by less marginal ones often so shortstacking kinda works. once i get to 10.00 then ill buy in for 1.00 on the short tables and hopefully get back to my initial buy in so i can start back on teh 2.00 tables and not tilt. from what i recall though the 2.00 tables are very fucking nitty.",1546300894

You're definitely right. I think I kept seeing her progress from what I personally know of her, not what her therapist and family have seen her go through. I can't even begin to imagine the current her acting the way her family describes how she used to be, so I don't think I've been giving the therapist their full credit.

I'll try to find my own therapist to give me some advice on patience - and I'll definitely keep the advice to myself. I'll only give my girlfriend my own advice.

Were his speeches meant to be hilarious in their over-seriousness when played directly after a scene where Eddie Brock dives into a fish tank at a restaurant and attempts to eat a live lobster? It has so many conflicting visions that are kind of jarring, but also really funny when presented together. The film also had super odd pacing, and there were all of these ‚ÄúWTF‚Äù moments where footage containing crucial character development was clearly cut out. It had a redeeming core with Brock and Venom‚Äôs interplay, but I couldn‚Äôt tell if the inconsistent tone was supposed to be kind of offbeat and funny, or if it was reflective of a bunch of production decisions.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","I have cerebral palsy, which in practice gives me very similar issues to dysgraphia (along with a bunch of other fun stuff, but I always bonded with the dysgraphia peeps over handwriting woes). In my early 20s I was also diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis, and my handwriting went from ""bad but legible, with effort"" to ""I guess I'll never write again because it hurts too much and even I can't read it when I try."" After almost 15 years of barely being able to sign my name,  I found fountain pens. I'm now writing in cursive (that same task literally sent me into floods of frustrated tears in elementary school), and practicing uncial lettering... and it doesn't look half bad! It doesn't look great, either, but if I didn't tell people ""hey, I'm gimpy and I hold pens really weird and a year ago I couldn't sign my name,"" they wouldn't know. I just look like a beginner at lettering, which I am.

&amp;#x200B;

You will find in your fountain pen journey that everything is individual (what works for me might not work for you) and that all variables make a difference (pen, nib, paper, and ink... not just nib).

&amp;#x200B;

Having said all of that, some discoveries I've made in 6 months in the hobby:

&amp;#x200B;

Good paper is a must when you're starting out and you're dealing with fine motor issues. Invest in a Rhodia pad, Clairefontaine, or Tomoe River. Once you've found your favorite amongst those, feel free to branch out and/or explore which pens and inks work well on cheaper paper - but start with good paper. A small Rhodia pad is $6. It's worth it. Without good paper, you'll be getting drag from all kinds of pens where the **nib** is not the problem - it's the **paper** causing the drag. Eliminate that issue from the beginning and you'll have a much happier experience.

&amp;#x200B;

Which nib to use will depend somewhat on the size of your handwriting. My handwriting is, and always has been, \*much\* neater the smaller I write, but I can't handle most fine nibs because of the drag - the feedback hurts my joints all the way up to the elbow, and then I start gripping the pen too tight etc, which just compounds the problem. So I found my way to broads and stubs and I'm learning to write larger. It's a process, both in terms of retraining my muscles and my **eyes** (to notice and then to **care** whether every stroke is even and in the right spot - in my ""old writing life"" the fact that I could make legible marks on paper was a victory in and of itself, so learning to **care** about evenness is actually harder than retraining my muscles to produce it.) 

&amp;#x200B;

If you're planning to use a Leuchtturm 1917 notebook, be aware that, while ""fountain pen friendly,"" they don't like a lot of ink. On Leuchtturm paper, broads and stubs will spread (creating a wider line than you intended), sometimes bleed, and possibly feather (depends on the ink). It might be worth it to source a notebook made from tomoe river, rhodia, or clairefontaine paper if you're planning on using a stub or a broad in a journal.

&amp;#x200B;

As far as pens, it depends on your budget. I started with a few Lamy Al-Stars and Safaris, which have swappable nibs... so I have a few fine nibs, a few mediums, and then a ton of broads and stubs that I just swap on and off my pens as needed. The TWSBI Go is another good option - not swappable, but inexpensive if you're afraid you won't like stubs or broads. The Eco is good too (the Go is cheaper than the Eco, so that's a matter of budget and taste). You can also buy a bunch of Jinhao x450s/x750s off Ebay for $5 a piece and then buy a bunch of nibs to put in them (Goulet sells some great nibs for a reasonable price). 

&amp;#x200B;

There's an even more inexpensive option that I've used to get other people with cerebral palsy going with fountain pens when they weren't sure what would work best for them, but it involves buying knockoff pens, which some people don't like the idea of. The Wing Sung 6359 is a ""fake"" Lamy Al-Star that can be found on ebay for about $3 a piece. They come with fine nibs, but genuine Lamy nibs fit as well... so if you're \*really\* on a tight budget, you can get a handful of those, try out the fine nibs that come on them (they're decent, but not great) and then swap them for genuine Lamy nibs if you so choose.

&amp;#x200B;

If I were you, since you already have a Safari, I'd just get some more Lamy nibs (with or without another Lamy pen - you can buy the nibs separately) and see how you like broads and stubs. Start with B and 1.1, maybe 1.5 if you really want to play around, and see how you like it. That way, if it's not for you, you can just take the broads and stub nibs off and you still have a serviceable pen or two. 

&amp;#x200B;

if you ever decide to try sulphate,a great way to tell if it's legit (beside effect) is if it dissolves in water. When I used to put some in water it would just float there until I shook the bottle vigorously. Even then you shld be able to see little bits floating around.

I met my husband in college. We were both in the marching band (me in guard, him in drumline) and he lost a bet to a buddy and had to dye his hair the ugliest bleached yellow ever, like neon orangey yellow. I saw him walking across the field with his buddies and made fun of it to my bff who said ""oh yea that's (her brother's) friend he was telling me about, I'm gonna go say hi!"" (She was really fishing for a boyfriend at the time). He said he knew he wanted to date me when he first saw me. I thought he was super funny and he invited me over any time I needed to kill time on campus (I lived off campus with my parents, he lived in the dorms with a roommate who was never there). 

I took him up on his offer once during the day between classes and we played Halo. I head shot one of his friends and they apparently all loved me after that lol. Then a couple nights later the friend I was supposed to be staying the night with ended up crashing at the dorm of her lay of the week and I was left without any where to stay (no longer friends for that and other reasons). I texted him and asked if I could crash there since his roommate wouldn't be there and he obviously said yes.  I half-expected him to be forward but he was super polite and funny. We stayed up all night just talking, he never pressured me into anything and made sure I was comfortable in every way. 

We started dating a week after that, and we've been together for over 8 years, married for over 6 years with a son who is nearly 4, all happy as ever :)",1546300898

Big thing here is that we seem to be offering him a six year deal.

""Mariners emerged as the most influential destination while the negotiation deadline was approaching. Kikuchi went to the United States on December 16 with intention of all 30 major teams OK""

""Among them, the military prepared large-scale conditions of six years scale. Ball team executives have been sending passionate love calls."" 

""Together with the stakeholders' story, not only the conditions but also the enthusiasm for acquisition seems to give a good impression to the Kikuchi side. The military became the lead candidate as we arrived.""

The rough translation in comprehensive form is that we gave a large offer in comparison to the other teams of six years and seem to be the frontrunners for Kikuchi. What a love call is, I'm not sure, but I'm guessing that it has to do with our enthusiasm towards acquiring him as a key piece to future playoff runs.",1546300900

I'm quoting and paraphrasing you as I agree with you-totally, and wanna reinforce the message:

&gt;Its frustrating...because...It shouldn't be someone elses responsibility to care of **another** person**'s** ~~who just finished eating.~~ shit.
&gt;
&gt;...customers...are in a public place. Act like a civil person. It takes less than 2 min to clean up your mess. Its respectful to others waiting to sit down as well.

**Sometimes that 2 mins doesn't even count because we'll be walking in that general direction anyway!**

&gt;
&gt;Sure, you can hire more staff to clean up your mess but this wont solve the issue. These people aren't even being paid well and...People expect the world from them... No one wants to take the job so we are stuck with what we have.

And compared to Fury Broly dmg wise and endurance no, Fury Broly is far superior than Red SSJ Vegeta. Red Fury Broly's stats is on par with red majin vegeta.

To make it simple, Fury Broly unique ability buffs movie units dmg and dmg reduction when a movie unit is switch into battle like your SSJ Broly.

If red ssj Vegeta is in your team he buffs bardock and bardock buffs him, the only downside due to his low stats he can also die easily in battle if not careful

But Red SSJ Vegeta is still worth getting to level 2000, he could be useful in  Broly's rising battle event b/c Red SSJ Vegeta can self heal with a green card

"CompulsiveSkinPicking","t5_2tcjc","It‚Äôs just what my therapist told me to do, and it helped me. The orange is less messy since the ice cube would melt. You can also just throw the orange back in the freezer for reuse. I would imagine you could use other objects, but I think the point of the orange is that it‚Äôs a generic object that everyone has easy access to. Also, the rind is thick so it really won‚Äôt make the fruit soggy or disgusting over time like say an apple. But if ice works better for you, go for it! I tried to was up one of those aluminum foil balls and use that, because I didn‚Äôt like the idea of the orange. Went back to my therapist and told her it didn‚Äôt work. She politely made me realize I was a dummy because aluminum foil wouldn‚Äôt hold a cool temperature like the orange would (because it‚Äôs not a conductor? I don‚Äôt know the exact terminology but I get it since the point of foil is used to keep the insulated temperature the same). So I just decided to do the orange and have loved it since.

2. Tell the groomer that the dog was recently adopted.

Original topic response: aside from my High Bond Level Servants, I imagine that Servants who's wishes could be fulfilled *without* the need for a Grail would probably stay. Kiyohime as an example (ie, servants like the stalker trio who are madly in love with you), or like Mata Hari (who wanted her own family). **Horrifying thought: To the despair of Chaldean support staff, Lancer Liz might have stayed to pursue her wish to become a pop idol(!?)**


This is a stretch, but I hope that some of the  immortals who would find life boring without Guda and Chaldea might stay as well.

*****
&gt; Amid the ongoing shutdown brought on by President Donald Trump&amp;#039;s refusal to passing funding measures without funding, the nation&amp;#039;s largest union of federal workers sued the Trump administration on Monday for forcing them to work without pay doing some of the most essential-and in many cases the most dangerous-jobs performed by government employees.

&gt; &amp;quot;Our members put their lives on the line to keep our country safe,&amp;quot; said Cox, &amp;quot;Requiring them to work without pay is nothing short of inhumane. Positions that are considered &amp;#039;essential&amp;#039; during a government shutdown are some of the most dangerous jobs in the federal government.""

&gt; A statement put out by the AFGE and its lawyers explained that the lawsuit was brought on behalf of all &amp;quot;Essential&amp;quot; federal employees, those who are required to work without pay during the shutdown.

I guess i had low expectations going in, maybe people expect too much from a mobile DAW? I just used it for fun and it kept me entertained.

Im not experienced enough that the app was limiting my progress so i cant comment on that. I haven't used it much since buying the PC version. But i hope to use it more, i think its great for trying to put ideas together when you are away from PC.

It's okay to achieve. It's acting like you are better than the rest of us, with or without actually having achieved anything to support such arrogance, which makes you a target. 

There are plenty of people who stand out and are treated as heroes. They are just humble about it. They let their achievements talk for themselves.

Most complaints about ""tall poppy syndrome"" come from the poppies themselves after they are cut down. Of course, in their heads it's because everyone was jealous of them. In reality it was because they were the sort of arrogant dick who would assume any issue people have with them is jealousy.

We simply aren't fans of elitists here and I think that's a good thing in a world where our ""betters"" are increasingly convinced of their righteousness in ruling over us. We've even seen them turn populism into a dirty word.",1546300915

""On the Bench"" as it were, I have the Phoenix Ryan, Mustang, Lysander, and Corsair. I decided to go mostly 46 or 60 size this year, purely for ease of storage and transport. I also have WAY too many gallons of glow, so no gassers for me until next year.

In terms of the Stang (and Corsair), I'm thinking about biting the bullet and just getting eFlite retracts for both, certainly at least for the Corsair. As pretty as the Phoenix retracts are, they seem to be the weak link in the their ARFs, and I wasn't shocked to hear you're having the same issues in your Mustang.

Showing your teeth makes people like you, it‚Äôs some weird power that comes from out ancestors baring their teeth to show submission. People open up and are generally feel easier when you smile at them. Try going to a chipotle(or a fast food place) and ordering your food with a smile. 2 things will probably happen.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah.  While it *can* be a bad thing, it has its plus sides.  People who say ""why didn't someone *stop them* instead of pulling out their phone?"" often have never actually been anywhere near that type of situation.  I'm a 120 pound, 5'3"" woman.  Like hell am I going to get myself a concussion or worse by being ""heroic"" and jumping in front of a 225 pound, 6 foot tall guy in rage mode.  That means that both me *and* the target get hurt, not that I magically become the Hulk and save the target's life then everyone throws me a parade.  It's not that I'd think the incident was funny, entertaining, or none of my business.  It's self-preservation.  But a cell video may be evidence.

Plus, some of these situations aren't necessarily immediately illegal or life threatening, but do have an impact if they go viral.  There are infinite videos that are essentially ""bigoted or crazy person screams offensive things at innocent people.""  Like it's terrible, but some methed out idiot screaming racial slurs in the parking lot of Dollar General is not necessarily a crime, and any attempt for my (tiny, black) ass to ""intervene"" would mean that they'd just turn and start screaming racial slurs at me.  But uploading a video of the incident means a) everyone knows what this asshole does on their off time (and they can be socially punished accordingly), and b) everyone knows that this type of thing does happen for no reason other than people are bigots.  

If you're big and strong, and the incident won't land *you* in jail, by all means, physically intervene.  If not....cell phones!",1546300918

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

People who think that Native American ancestry is some wild advantage and a cool thing to claim need to learn more history. My best friend is 1/4 Native American. I can't begin to describe the negative effects that has had on her father and his family; the shame her father felt affected everything he did. He tried to hide his ancestry all his life. People of Warren's parents' generation and before were not all ""this is hip!""

Believe in God?  God no. The various descriptions of ‚ÄúGod‚Äù all sound like frustrated, vengeful, and capricious human beings. I'm open to something better and with evidence, though. 

Still Christian? Not in any orthodox or even heterodox sense. A number of things written about his teachings and character still resonate with me, but not exclusively nor without considerable reservations. I like some concepts, dislike others. 

To have hope for life beyond this, it would have to be far better an experience than any described by any religion. ‚ÄúEternity is a long time, especially towards the end.‚Äù ( variously attributed to Stephen Hawking or Woody Allen. I prefer Allen.)

Tried alcohol - I prefer a light sweet grade of gasoline. ü§Æ  But I think it has a place in responsible society as well as has incredible downsides. 

Sex is, next to food, the best thing ever invented. But like alcohol it has upsides and downsides. Don‚Äôt abuse anyone with it, don‚Äôt cheat on your SO unless you can live with the consequences. But also don‚Äôt think you have any right to dictate to consenting people of age what they can and can‚Äôt do, or who they can and can‚Äôt love. 

My politics are a strange mix of conservative liberalism - I like my freedoms, I own guns ( but nothing with high capacity removable magazines, those are for military use, mass murder, and killing kids) the main role of government is to help us all live together and to help us take care of each other - that‚Äôs what civilization is for.

"C25K","t5_2rgoq","I actually find that learning to run on a treadmill has made some aspects of C25K a lot easier! One of the things that a lot of new runners struggle with is going too fast for their running portions - you want to be able to hold a conversation while running, so sprinting is a bad idea. With a treadmill, I'm able to keep my speed slow but consistent so that I don't struggle through the longer runs.

Plus, honestly, treadmill running can be really boring so learning to occupy your mind while running *now* will make it a lot easier to overcome the mental difficulties of running when you eventually make it outside.

And finally, YMMV, but have you tried googling ""where to run"" + your city name? I live in a big, busy city as well, but that just means there are more runners around who will be able to point you to their favourite spots.",1546300922

What made it even worse was that when I started splashing fuel on the fire my mates were all ""don't be a dickhead you'll set fire to yourself"", but I wanted to be the big man in charge of the fire.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Reduces it by a fair amount because you have to wait the 30 days, and you can't drop your dude in their after the raid tier drops because the spots would be taken up within 30 days.

So you would need to do it prior to the raid being released. Not to mention their is a HUGE difference between a full clear and 1 boss in terms of prices. 1 boss on Heroic is like 200-300k depending on your realm approx, a full clear is like 600k-1M. For mythic it's like 1m+ easily for G'huun alone, not to mention a full clear is like 5M+.

If anything this would raise the prices of the achievement by an insane amount and very few people would pay that much for it.

The guild would need to guarantee you they can 100% get it, otherwise you just wasted your only chance.


They could easily limit it to 40 players per guild can get the achievement. This would only leave 10-15 slots for people to sell per guild. This would also raise the price of the achievement. 


Sure you can't 100% stop people selling it, but you can make it require so many conditions that it's availability is nuked hard.

If a guild can only sell 10-15 titles, it's going to be a LOT more expensive to buy, not to mention a full clear is an insane amount especially the first month it's going to be gold cap most likely which is a few thousand dollars irl alone.

That on-top of the limit availability, and the risk that the guild you put your alt in might not get the kill before the other guilds would make it very expensive.



Hell, if Blizzard finds out these guilds sold achievement/title carries for irl $$$ then they can remove every Famed Slayer achievement from players who ran with them.

This also adds a risk to buyers that ""Hey if you buy from these sellers and they get caught all your money you spent is going to be wasted"".

From the [Rode FAQ](http://www.rode.com/blog/all/is-the-rode-videomic-compatible-with-my-camera);

&gt; Now that we have identified and confirmed that our external microphone input exists and is of the standard 3.5mm, there's one more important factor to consider if intending to use the VideoMicro, or [VideoMic¬†GO](http://www.rode.com/microphones/videomicgo). This is called 'Plug In Power'.  
&gt;  
&gt;'Plug In Power, is the name of a low-level voltage, usually three to five volts, which can be supplied directly by the camera via the 3.5mm microphone input. The¬†R√òDE on-camera microphones that do not feature an onboard 9V battery, such as VideoMicro¬†and the VideoMic GO, rely ¬†on 'Plug In Power' to operate. Without it, your recording microphone will not work.  
&gt;  
&gt;Check with your camera manufacturer that 'Plug In Power' is supplied via your camera's mic¬†before deciding whether or not to invest in these particular devices.

Some cameras produce it, some cameras don't.  My guess is your AX33 does not.

You could also try not taking your medication on Thursday and Friday then take it Saturday-Wednesday. If you feel the same Tuesday and Wednesday as you do the last two days of the other cycle, you might be on to something.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I'm truly sorry for what you're going through. It makes sense that you feel like a failure because clearly there are people who have failed you if you're 14 years old and aren't going to school. At your age, I would say that others (your parents, your teachers, other adults who have a responsibility to help guide you) are primarily responsible for your current state and you have every right to be angry at and disappointed with these people who have failed you.

However, over the next few years you will gain much more control over your life and with that you will be much more responsible for your life. I would advise you to spend these next few years trying to do all you can to prepare for the future when you are the adult. You can be angry or depressed about your shitty circumstances or you can let that be motivation to change who you are and with that change your situation.

I'd imagine that someone in your position  might be reluctant to trust others when people have clearly failed you in the past, but there are reliable people in this world. Some are surrounded by them; others have to look much harder. I don't know who the psychologist is you're scheduled to see but they might be such a person who can help you improve your situation. But whether they are or not I would encourage you to look for others who are willing and able to help you.

I hope you don't give up and kill yourself at 14. I don't know who you are, but even in such a shitty situation  truly believe that you have hope for a different future. It's unfair that you bear so much responsibility for that future in your current circumstances, but life isn't fair. I'm not telling you to suck it up. I'm not telling you to get over it. I'm telling you to not let your current despair be the end of you. If you want to be sad, that's totally understandable, but DO more than just be sad. DO something to better yourself and your situation. For as long as you're not going to school try to learn and exercise at home. The longest journey starts with a single step. Choose to live and choose to try again to change your life one step at a time.

I would recommend the book The Power of Now by Eckhart Toel. It's about putting your past in perspective and remembering that the time you can influence the most is the present, not the past or the future.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","welp you got me, I only answered the first question. 

fine, the reason why teams decide to pump so many resources into this is because its an investment. By scouting and training these talented kids, teams are guaranteeing that they will always have a pipeline of talent that will sign with them without having to burn money and sign the best talent/free agents or face the consequences of being bottom of the league and hurt their brand/image and lose revenue and go bankrupt in the future. 

An unintended consequence of a system like this (at least in good academies) is that all of the kids being trained are being brought up in the head coaching staff's ""image"" and ""philosophy"" and will slide right into the first team without as bad as an adjustment period that a lot of rookies might otherwise face. They'll have the system, the plays, and roles drilled into them everyday. This is something schools can't provide, 100% top-level ready rookies. Add to the fact that there are multiple kids that are come through the system together building chemistry, You can get a a fairly competitive team together being signed at the cost of one star player.

And before anyone says it would cost too much for single teams to run an academy, the NBA is the 4th most profitable league in the world. If 2nd league soccer teams in other countries can run an academy, I really don't see how an NBA franchise couldn't run a high school for prospects.",1546300929

Found this from /u/white_light-king concerning the Japanese POWs.  

I would really have to re-read my books... but, to speculate based on memory.  There was always a stigma attached to surrender in Japanese culture.  As the link demonstrates, these POWs, once returned, were subjected to trials to prove that they had done all they could before surrendering.  

I would imagine that most Japanese would struggle to their feet one last time, only to be shot once more rather than surrender.  That an officer would cover his men‚Äôs retreat, and perish in the act, rather than face the shame of having to order that retreat.  A tanker or pilot would rather steer his craft into the enemy, rather than limp home with neither ammunition nor tales of victory.

Edit:  Conversely, the Russian soldiers were mostly poorly trained conscripts taken from many different parts of the vast breadth of the Russian expanse.  Taken to fight for an Emperor whom they had probably never seen or bore any love for.  Raised in a culture very much unlike Japan where the Emperor was nearly worshipped and where the prevailing belief was that it was glory to give one‚Äôs life for that Emperor.

Yes, I‚Äôd say the Russians would be much more likely to throw down their arms.  Statistically:  Russian POWs - 80,000+.  Japanese POWs - 2,000.  Just about 40:1",1546300930

As a kid I was in lobe with the story and would talk to every npc and try and would recall scenes from the tv series and enjoy the awe and mystery of it all. But instead when I play it now, I am focused on stats, guides, moves, and meta game. One of the only reason stats , types, and baseline stats were added was due to availability of space. It makes sense they are gonna split special attack and attack, the only reason they didn‚Äôt originally was due to space limitation and lack of data. Now games can be massive like skyrim, mario odyssey, or disgae so why recycle the same space constrained mechanics, add some more complex processes and story. While meta game is good its seems to be my only focus now, and i hope that the new game can add some real progress. Reintroduce day and night,  add more dynamic puzzles, ",1546300930

indy, I have no qualms with your comment overall, as it is all very valid, but I can't help but feel there is a (possibly inadvertent) implication here that I am part of the ""quantity &gt; quality crowd"". Let me be very clear: I spend months and months of my time crafting worlds and stories I think my readers will enjoy, and the idea of writing for nothing more than length is nothing short of distressing to me. I do not believe you meant to make this implication, but this is my standing up to that remark, in case potential readers take it to mean I'm a well-known ""quantity writer"", which is very hardly the case.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Im like you so I totally understand the struggle! It's not your fault for wanting to treat people well and being forgiving and cutting them tons of slack. I've been where you are in a couple of friendships and it was really hard to break away. It's hard to find the line between being an understanding person and being someone that is so forgiving that people do whatever they want to.

You have to keep reminding youself not to feel bad because you are taking responsibility for your own quality of life, which ""friends"" like this obviously don't care about. Just because they say you are their best friend doesn't mean they act as a best friend to you. If they are constantly undermining your happiness and mostly only taking in the friendship then you have to set a line somewhere and not feel bad when you establish boundaries for how you want to be treated. People like these ""friends"" are energy vampires they will just take and take and use and use and make YOU feel guilty for not having enough to give them. This is unhealthy for everyone.

You don't need to change who you are but it would be healthy for you to establish and enforce boundaries with people. Decide what is and what isn't acceptable friend behavior. Determine where a person fits in to these standards and make your call from there. There will always be some annoying things about a friend you have to get over but you should know to yourself what the deal breakers are. I think this may be hard for you because it was for me but if you really try to work on it and remind yourself and force yourself to follow your boundaries it will get easier.

A good way to look at it is say someone you cared about (X) was describing their friendship with another person (W). If this person W was treating your friend X in a way you didnt like you would instantly recognize it and feel defensive of X. So play any scenarios where you question the situation like this - if you wouldn't want X treated this way don't let anyone treat YOU this way. Also if you wouldn't want X or yourself to be treated that way don't be friends with or associate woth anyone who behaves like W. Does that make sense?",1546300932

Edit: N here is the level of the ring, so a level 15 ring would improve evasion by 1.15^16 , which comes out to 9.357. I also just realized that the percentage number is likely derived from the wiki equation by subtracting 1 from the result, meaning that 1.15 is 115% of your base evade.",1546300932

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","You're right that mercury is a toxic and highly dangerous metal, nobody is gonna argue about that of course, esp since a professional died after a scientist, Karen Wetterhahn, died from spilling a few mere *droplets* of it onto her glove, which mercury soaked right through and gradually, over 40(?) days, she begun degenerating neurologically, until death.

But that was Dimethylmercury.

Vaccines do not use that compound, and you honestly need not to see any further than the fact that most of the human race is still alive as, if they were using that type of mercury, you and I would be brain dead by now, alongside most of everyone else.

Tell me, you've surely vomitted in the past, so can you tell me why you aren't dead? After all, you vomit up stomach acid alongside everything else, and by all logic, your insides should have been burnt up and you should have died a horrible death as your own vomit burns holes inside of your body... But it doesn't, you know why? Because despite things sharing a name/classification/title/whatever they can act differently from each other. The stomach acid of humans is not as corrosive as that of a bird that eats fucking bone (Bone-eating vultures are rad, google them and look at how beautiful they are tbh.) nor battery acid, or hydrochloric acid.

Same principle here. They may both be mercury in some way, shape or form, but their structure, function, and ability is *vastly different.* Thiomersal isn't just used in vaccines, it is used as a preservative in tattoo inks (Which is exposed to the skin, which would kill you if it was like dimethylmercury, but it doesn't, does it?)

Yes, mercury is dangerous and can and will kill you in certain cases, but not all mercury is created equal, just as acid. Thiomersal isn't just used in vaccines, and have been largely removed from them anyway because of public fear, which is largely seen as unsubstantiated.

TL;DR: Think of mercury as acid, you can vomit stomach acid and be fine, but you can't say the same for battery acid or hydrochloric acid.",1546300934

Consider that China is the source of about 25% of the world's climate pollution as things currently stand. Whatever positive or negative impact your family has on the environment is going to be minuscule compared to the choices that are made on a massive scale by countries like China. 
I do hope that there will be enough cooperation between countries or a technology breakthrough to help manage the problem of climate change, but I am not going to live my life based on worrying about a problem that I really don't have that much control over on a personal level. Previous generations had their own fears about different doomsday scenarios (such as the fear of nuclear war that was so prevalent in the 1950s for example) and somehow humanity keeps finding ways to survive in spite of it all.

Chow is still unknown. He‚Äôs def more of a gamble compared to the data already out for DR. Magic cover tanks will be very very important as trials come along, but you can also ask a friend for one if you don‚Äôt end up getting a second Chow.

Overall: Magic tanks seem to be the hole in your team but still have chance to get chow while you‚Äôll need to wait 1 year for DR. Chow is also a gamble (he may stink!) but likely better than m.ramza. You can always ask for magic tank from friend to beat trials (until you pull another chow, CG Charlotte, basch, or use m.ramza on non-dispel bosses) and keep using DR if you like him more :)

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","&gt;I can fucking guarantee you that no captain has ever blocked Staff from coming in to a brigade. When the CFA want to staff a station, they staff a station. If the captain doesnt want it, they‚Äôre advised to sack up or fuck off.

Believe it or not that happened. 

Maybe I wasn't clear - the CFA didn't want to staff the station, they wanted to respond the nearest staffed station into the Vol brigades area when they received a call. To me that's a common sense decision. The Vol brigade turns up, don't need the Perms they can cancel them. But if the Vol brigade doesn't show, then there's at least a crew en route. 

That's what the Captain said no to. Fucked if I know why. 

&gt;There was almost certainly a cost benefit decision, which volunteers have zero impact on. I was volunteering at a station that almost got perm staff- it was declined due to lack of space to build accom facilities, and demolishing a $2 million station that was &lt;10 years old was not in the interest of brigades.

That make sense, provided that service was ok. Because for mine that's what matters. 

&gt;Add to that the cost of staffing a station being well over $2.5m a year for a single truck.

If the cost is justified by number of calls, risk factor etc then that's fine. If it's not justified then they don't do it. 

I guess that's the point I'm trying to make. If they just use the verifiable data available to make the call regarding staffing/enhanced response then that's way better than the feelsploitation going on now. 

&gt;There are verifiable measures, it basically comes down to cost, number of turnouts, and overall response times- if brigades aren‚Äôt making 40% of non-structure fire turnout times, thats very different from 40% of structure fires and/or 40% of Rescue calls.

That's true in theory, but in execution it's not so clear. You know how easy the figures are to fudge by changing call categories etc. 

You seem pretty well informed overall and aren't just giving the ""won't somebody think of their feelings"" response that this topic seems to engender. 

What's your thoughts on the whole?

Those are your materials.  Read them.  


Work practice test.  Section by section go over every question you miss.  Categorize it according to info in materials:  for example, math categorize by math topic, reading by question type, etc.  Make a list of topics to review for each section.  


Once you have analyzed every question, use the list of topics to review info from materials.  Make sure you know how to answer every question you missed or that gave you trouble.  


Work another test...same same.  


After three tests, go back to re-work them in order.  Analyze and review every question missed.  


Go to three more tests.  


Each test takes 3 hours.  Analyzing and reviewing takes 3 hours.  Your goal is 5 practice tests a week.  


Reading materials will take you about 6 hours (first time)

The disagreement comes with choices. There are people that view acts and orientation differently, you can choose to sleep with the same sex, vs being attracted to them. Not saying it‚Äôs my view but certainly people have that position and they can hold it or not, up to them. It doesn‚Äôt mean they are a bigot for it any more than it makes people a bigot for thinking a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim are wrong.

As per your example, In a time where food is scarce and hard labour is normal, lots of people are tan and muscular, fat people are rare and revered. In a time when food is abundant and it's easy to be overweight (and the resource of time is scarce), people who are tan and fit are revered. 

Where people are dark, being lighter is desirable (see India/Asia). Where people are light, being darker is desirable (dat tan tho). Of course, there are exceptions to every rule, and in this case, I think it would be if the thing that makes you rare is seen as a defect.",1546300940

It‚Äôs an individual process that ultimately helps the collective. And when enough people are ready to learn, the ‚Äòmajor‚Äô leaders will come to the front more so so they can show the way. IMO

Yeah, like I said, there are some basics you'll want to learn about vegan nutrition if you were to go vegan, 

* https://www.theveganrd.com/vegan-nutrition-101/food-guide-for-vegans/ is a beginner's guide, 
* https://veganhealth.org/ is a very comprehensive resource if you have really deep questions,
* https://cronometer.com/ is a free, online, nutrition tracker you can use for a little while in the beginning once you get into it, to see what you're actually getting through diet, and what needs adjusting. (You don't have to hit the targets every single day perfectly: it's okay if you're a little under on some days if you're over on others)

but you really don't have to do these things just to try 1 or 2 vegan meals.  

As for protein specifically, there's protein in lots of plant food groups (especially in the beans, nuts and seeds, and grains types), and also it's an enormously overemphasized nutrient.  There are other ones you may have to pay attention to more, like Vitamin B12, Vitamin D, Calcium, or Iron.  If they're eating a variety of food groups (including grains and beans, not just fruits and vegetables), not a lot of people really have to plan out their protein intake.  [Strength athletes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHrysja5lYw) ([strongmen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kf53m2HHIPs), power lifters, bodybuilders, etc.) may require a little bit more than other people, but even they often can eat what you might consider quite ""normal"" or ""varied"" vegan diets (just usually in greater amounts).  

Anyways, 

&gt; What desserts are good vegan substitutes? I enjoy ice cream, mostly vanilla 

You're in luck for ice cream, because there are [a ton of vegan ice creams](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+ice+cream+brands&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0) being made now, and a lot of them are very good.  Even household names like Ben and Jerry's and Breyer's are making a few non-dairy flavors.  If you want a simple one, try one of [Breyer's](https://www.breyers.com/us/en/non-dairy-frozen-desserts.html) non-dairy options, and if you want a fancy one try So Delicious (they also make great plant milk), but they can be expensive.  If you want a very cheap option, a simple, homemade recipe you can try if you have a blender is [banana ice cream](https://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2016/08/22/banana-ice-cream-healthy/), which is literally just frozen bananas and maybe some flavorings blended, and it comes out like soft serve.  It's extremely cheap, easy, and much healthier and lower in calories than dairy ice cream (you can adjust the amount of sugar and flavorings you add).  

&gt; cinnamon rolls, coffee cake

* You can look for completely store-bought vegan versions of these by reading the ingredient list and looking for ones with animal products like eggs, milk, butter, etc.  
* You can use something that does part of the work, like [Annie's Cinnamon Roll Dough](https://www.livekindly.co/annies-organic-vegan-cinnamon-roll-dough-with-dairy-free-icing-arrive-at-costco/) or [Pillsbury Original Crescents](https://www.peta2.com/vegan-life/easy-vegan-cinnamon-roll-recipe/), and modify the recipe to not use animal products and use vegan versions instead (vegan butter, margarine, or sometimes vegetable oil instead of butter, etc.), or 
* You can make your own [from scratch](https://www.google.com/search?q=vegan+cinnamon+rolls+recipe), just start with looking up a vegan recipe for whatever you're looking to eat

Not many people think about them like this, but many of the cake mixes (and even icings) from brands like Betty Crocker and Duncan Hines are actually vegan if you don't add things like eggs, butter, or milk to them.  

And, while it's something to work up to because it takes a little research, once you learn the substitutes you can use in baking for things like eggs, butter, milk, etc., you can veganize many baking recipes, without too much hassle.  

&gt; diary based sugary desserts

There's vegan whipped cream (So Delicious Coco Whip or Reddi Wip Almond or Coconut), vegan cheesecake (Daiya), many fruity ice pops or sorbets are already vegan by default, etc.  Obviously, these aren't the healthiest things for you, but they do exist or there are ways to make them.  ",1546300942

From Wiki

&gt;Outside intradivisional match-ups (each of which is played twice-yearly), the home team for each match-up is also determined by the league according to a set rotation designed to largely alternate home and away designations over successive years.[7] This rotation was slightly adjusted in 2010 for teams playing against the NFC West and AFC West, after several east-coast teams (such as the New England Patriots and New York Jets in 2008) all had to make four cross-country trips to play games in San Diego, San Francisco, Oakland, and Seattle in one season.[8]",1546300944

Algenist is a great (but expensive) brand if you‚Äôre looking for anti aging products ‚Äî their products have the most collagen in them that you can purchase outside of a dermatologist. If you‚Äôre a skincare junky like me you could even use an eye gel at night / cream during the day one of my favorite products is ole henriksen eye gel it tightens and de puffs really well and feels nice.

Warren is a great Senator because of she has policy plans that could actually address the problems suffered by many Americans, even if they don't sound sexy or disruptive when distilled to a sound bite or a mantra shouted at rallies.

Don't get me wrong, Warren would have my vote and her mind for policy would be a great change of pace for the executive branch, but she's not shown herself to be good at the things that get someone elected president.

AFAIK RemoteFX is only officially supported when both, virtualized and root, OS are the same, so it was luck it worked at all so far.

My results look a little different though. I can log on, but when DWM starts the screen stops updating. But I can, blindly, control the VM.

They did such a good job with the old concession stand and old equipment, that the school allowed them to dictate the design of the new concession stand when the new stadium was built. 

The football boosters are now relegated to a shack selling T-shirts another gaudy swag, while the concession stand pays for almost half of students' trip fees.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt; The actual crux of my argument is that FA rights are not infringed here.

Given that neither of us are lawyers, I‚Äôm going to leave interpreting the 1A to the courts. Although it seems that my position that this is an issue of compelled speech has some legal precedent supporting it (*i.e.* see the relevant Kansas and Arizona rulings).

&gt; However, certain behaviors, certain forms of speech are already barred to some state and federal employees. You can't drink on the job, for example.

Yes but you can still purchase alcohol with the money you earn on the job. There‚Äôs a difference between actions *while* you work that impede your ability to fulfill your tasks and actions you perform as a private citizen that are irrelevant to your ability to perform at your job. This particular example most definitely in the latter category, and there is legal precedence in Kansas and Arizona supporting this position.

&gt; As for the contractors, in this case, their actions go against the interests of the government and people of the state of Texas.

Irrelevant. In a free, western society, all citizens are allowed to openly disagree with their government, this is literally what the 1A says. It‚Äôs laughable that you don‚Äôt see this.

There were a few ladies just outside the market selling tamale tortas, a wonderful carbohydrate fusion.  


[https://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/mexico-city/things-to-do/sights/reviews/mercado-sobre-ruedas-176048](https://www.fodors.com/world/mexico-and-central-america/mexico/mexico-city/things-to-do/sights/reviews/mercado-sobre-ruedas-176048)

&amp;#x200B;

The Parque Mexico is a great little spot for relaxing or jogging, and it has a dog park if you like hanging with canines. For a full day or two you can't beat spending some time in Chapultepec, and don't forget the Anthropology museum. The Paseo de la Reforma is closed to car traffic on Sundays, and it fills with pedestrians, cyclists, roller bladers, and other folks just enjoying a day off. Try renting a bike and going back and forth between the north side of Condesa and the city center.  


Some of my favorite restaurants in the area were El Kaliman, El Tizoncito, Fat Boy Moves, Taqueria El Greco, and El Deposito is a great spot for trying some different beers. Chillakillers is a little bit of a walk, but also a good spot.

English has the huge advantage of having a greater sound palette than Japanese. But Japanese etymology is much shorter, so simply knowing Chinese characters suffices (rather than Greek, and Latin, and French influence on spelling.)

"StarWarsCantina","t5_ge6kz","&gt;Making the conclusion of Rey's arc be a repeat of Luke's, extremely risky emotional labor done for the benefit of another person who is a massive active threat to the larger goal, is not just repetitious, it limits the character. Luke was not oriented around other characters until the end of his maturation in RotJ, Rey already is.

But we're not in disagreement here: I'm saying that for Ben ROTJ is over and now it's on him to figure out how to give selflessly. And for REY ROTJ is over too. Whatever they have planned for her in IX, it's not ""extremely risky emotional labor.""

She's tried being Luke in ROTJ and now she's on to something else, just like Ben is not Anakin in ROTJ: he's lived and is moving on to something else in IX.

&gt;Yes, the two characters are interconnected. So if you just project a path for one focused solely on that character's growth, you're going to run the risk of hurting the other's characterization. As I brought up at the start of my tree, I'm open to Ben growing a bit, but not a full redemption.

I think it works fine, as I did above, to project a path for both based on the idea that they get to live beyond their ROTJ moment in TLJ. The fact that I'm focusing on Ben in the original post is because (a) his redemption is a point of conflict and I wanted to explain where I believe the story structure and themes will go and (b) as I mentioned, there's not the same big bullhorn foreshadowing what Rey will do in IX.

The best all around headphones I've heard that work for music, games and movies are the tecsun caogen wood headphones. But they mist he pad rolled for different uses. Before I tried these my all around headphone was the he400i. The zmf classics i own have a crazy soundstage and great instrument separation. They have really good bass too. But lacks an open sounding top end due to them being semi open. These sound good with every genre of music and will allow you to hear every detail of your music. But they also need really good clean power to sound their best and get the most from the low end. The ad900x are fantastic for gaming. They have superb imaging and positional audio. Bass is snappy and enough to keep you engaged but not enough to get in the way of the footsteps and other cues in fps games that will help give you a competitive edge. These are also good with music and easy to drive. 

There are so many headphones out their under $100 it's hard to say what will be just what your after. I like ally headphones for different reasons. ",1546300953

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Problem is whether you can get the BTC. They will most likely take off after you give them the in-game currency. They are also afraid of you doing the same. Once you receive the BTC you can decide which fiat exchange to send it to. 

Coinbase automatically reports you to the IRS if you make over 10k. Not sure if they send the UK government a tax report. Kraken is another exchange but they takes months to verify. You might have to go with a local exchange that trades Bitcoin for fiat.

Now the third problem is the UK bank. I've heard of several stories where men in the UK withdrew big amounts into their bank and these were subsequently frozen with no explanation. There were even stories about cops raiding their homes looking for drugs and interrogating them. My advice would be to consult your bank before send them fiat, get them to okay everything in writing. If police come, do not let them in without a warrant and do not answer any questions without a lawyer advising you. 

Take your time once you get Bitcoin in your possession. It will only go up in value with time. I'd focus on getting a hardware wallet first like a ledger nano S and learning how to store Bitcoin. Then I would go about carefully exchanging your game currency for Bitcoin. Take your time, don't get scammed.

"baccarat","t5_2z9lt","OP, I really don‚Äôt know if you can make a living in baccarat but I do know if you are serious . This is the few basic step you need to take :-

1. Research Like a Crazy Person

The first thing that you need to do is learn absolutely everything you can about playing your game for a living. Look up other professionals, how they make money, and any other information you can on the topic. Try and identify if there is a smooth road to the top or if it‚Äôs something that requires a leap of faith (avoid these situations). What you‚Äôre really trying to do here is a get an idea of what it‚Äôs going to take for your game specifically to make it to the top. 

2. Formulate a Plan of Attack

The next step is to take all of your research and come up with a plan for you to go from schmo to pro. Make sure that your plan is detailed and gives you actionable steps that you can take to achieve your goal. This should mainly be based around how you‚Äôre going to learn the game, how you‚Äôre going to master it, how you‚Äôre going to test your skills without risking an arm and a leg, and ultimately how you‚Äôre going to turn it from a hobby into a career. Be realistic and make a plan that you can stick to.

3. Understand the Risks

You HAVE to understand that what you are attempting to do here is not easy. If it were easy, everyone and their brother would be a professional gambler. The risks are real, and when you lose money, you don‚Äôt just get it back with a do-over. There is no reset button on a lot of this.

The good news is that the nature of the industry now allows you to start these games for very low stakes and minimal risk. Take advantage of this. Online casinos don‚Äôt have to pay additional dealers or setup costs to facilitate more games which means they can offer things at super low stakes.

4. Start Learning  

The only way that you‚Äôre going to make it to the pro level with any of these games is by immersing yourself completely in the learning process. You have to soak up every bit of information out there and ultimately know more than your opponents.Here‚Äôs the most important part, though. Make sure that the information you are learning is good information.

5. Start Small and Continually Adapt

Take. Your. Time. This is not something that is going to happen overnight. This is not something that is going to happen in a few weeks. It very well could take years for you to be able to reach the skill level necessary even to take a shot at playing professionally for a living. Even if you‚Äôre good enough, you still might not make it. You might not have access to the right opportunities, or you may have issues getting your mental game or bankroll management in line.  

If think you have taken this few step then by all mean , go ahead. If not I would recommend VegasCasino.io to brush up on gaming skill 1st and play as recreational player like the rest of us.  ",1546300957

Gather all your important documents, make sure you money and other accounts are fully separated and that he has no access to them, and move out when he's away.

Don't give him your new address, block him, get a restraining order if you have to, and fine give him a chance to talk you into taking him back

I‚Äôm 18 now and have a car I have given everyone I know a ride except her and I don‚Äôt say hello to her at all she even got in lots of fights with my dad how I‚Äôm disrespectful to her and my dad talks to me all the time that I have to say hello to her at least but I just don‚Äôt talk to her at all I‚Äôm treating her like she doesn‚Äôt exist in the house , sadly I have to live with my father even though I love him but hate living there because of my step mom , my real mother has a job and a house but cannot afford me and my brother living there with her . 

At first when I was like 12 she would always shout at me or my brother for the tiniest things and I couldn‚Äôt stand up to her , now she can‚Äôt shout at me and whenever she shouts on my little brother I stand in her face and shout right back after a few times she just stopped . 

Nobody likes her except for my father for some reason , my aunts and relatives always talk shit behind her back just so my father wouldn‚Äôt get upset , she‚Äôs the nastiest person I‚Äôve met and I hope she lives a miserable life and I‚Äôm trying to make sure of it .

It gets weirder, too. Any particles emitted by a white hole would have been expelled for an infinite amount of time and potentially wouldn't have even originated from our universe. There's theories that black holes could be paired to white holes in other universes. There's theories that white holes could have pre-dated or even caused the big bang. They could be what happens to a black hole upon it's ""death"", as well.

Though, white holes are entirely hypothetical. They're a mathematical solution to the Einstein Field Equations. The only *potential* evidence we have of their existence is an unexplained long gamma ray burst [which did not correlate to a supernova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRB_060614).

Maybe it‚Äôs Benson or Jesse. Maybe it‚Äôs a trade or UFA signing for a guy who lights it up like Chia‚Äôs son or like Maroon did. Maybe Spooner somehow becomes an Aberg for us. Maybe Looch miraculously starts scoring again. 

I can‚Äôt see UFAs signing here even if we did rid ourselves of Reggie‚Äôs, Spooner‚Äôs, and Looch‚Äôs contracts unless somehow players want to play for Hitch or the next coach/GM brought in. 

One possibility for a quicker turnaround is what the Islanders did a couple years ago, trading for a couple D that had 1 year remaining before becoming a UFA, so if I were GM I might explore that to bridge the gap between our own developing D coming up. 

Goaltending is going to be interesting to see what they do, be it Kostko, Talbot, or a new goalie or two. We‚Äôve seen the difference good and bad goaltending can make. 

If I‚Äôm this Oilers team my top 2 priorities for the remainder of the year is setting Looch and Jesse up for as much success as possible through coaching, mental training, exorcism, or whatever else it takes. If there‚Äôs any chance at all of this team being successful in the next couple years, both these players either need to play well enough to be tradeable or to contribute to this team. ",1546300966

That is the argument from ignorance. The fact that you find things you don't have an explanation for, so you might as well call it a god.

You're telling me a god exists. Someone probably told you a god exists. The very first god was probably told to others by the person who conceived it.

&gt;There's no need to accept claims when the evidence is right in front of us.

The reason I'm having trouble entertaining any arguments where there's a net deficit on our economy is, illegal immigrants wouldn't be coming here if there weren't better jobs for them. Therefore, American citizens are hiring them. Which means that they're creating economic value. If they weren't creating economic value, nobody would be hiring them, and they'd have no reason to cross the border.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","          The way your body will burn fat is if you‚Äôre eating at a caloric deficit. ( less than your maintenance calories) The maintenance calories is how much your body needs to maintain the same weight and fat. 

 So say someone is 165 lbs and their activity level throughout the day, including a daily workout is pretty low (office job) Their maintenance level may be around 2,000~2,400 ,depending on genetics and a few other factors. (These numbers include a workout) A few hundred less if a workout is not included. 1,600~2,000

So say this person wants to lose a healthy amount of fat while maintaining the most muscle possible. They may want to take off about 500 calories from their maintenance. Down to 1,500~1,900. It takes 3,500 calories under maintenance to lose 1 lb of fat. So at that rate considering our example is consistent, they can lose about 1 lb of fat a week whilst having minimal muscle loss. 

Ones maintenance level can vary from person to person and can only very accurately be found off of a consistent activity and diet followed by a weigh in at the same time and factors. Then based off of that data, some adjustments are made. 

Once weight drops, those maintenance calories may as well so make sure to adjust accordingly.

There are many other factors but this is a simple explanation as I can say it!

*EDIT

Sorry guys, I got my information mixed up as it was a very late night for me and meant to say that for our office worker a daily workout was indeed included in the maintenance calories of our example, as well as fixed a few other details!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","So, people have already covered the atheist/agnostic distinction -- basically, if you can't say ""I believe that God exists,"" then you are not a theist, and so by definition, you're an atheist. ""I don't know"" is a statement about knowledge; unless you say ""I don't know, but I choose to believe God exists anyway,"" then your ""I don't know"" probably makes you an agnostic atheist.

But I'll make the hard atheism argument: I believe that no gods exist.

I'll start with Russell's Teapot, the thing referenced in the Snoo for this subreddit. There is not conclusive falsifiable reproducible evidence that there is *not* a real, physical teapot in orbit around the Sun somewhere between Earth and Mars. Russell explains, probably using the definition of 'agnostic' you were thinking of:

&gt; I ought to call myself an agnostic; but, for all practical purposes, I am an atheist. I do not think the existence of the Christian God any more probable than the existence of the Gods of Olympus or Valhalla. To take another illustration: nobody can prove that there is not between the Earth and Mars a china teapot revolving in an elliptical orbit, but nobody thinks this sufficiently likely to be taken into account in practice. I think the Christian God just as unlikely.

I think he's too generous. Teapots exist, and there's nothing physically impossible about a celestial teapot. We don't know whether or not extra-universal consciousness is even *possible,* and everything we know about consciousness suggests it isn't, but if we wanted to spend the resources, we could launch a teapot into orbit around the sun today.

And yet, are you actually agnostic about the teapot? I'm not. I'm perfectly comfortable believing there is no celestial teapot. It's true that I don't know in an absolute sense, and one day someone might discover evidence that I'm wrong, but that's true of everything we know, even the things we know with falsifiable reproducible evidence. For now, the possibility is so unlikely that I don't take the idea that it *might* be true seriously.

And again: That's the teapot, a thing physically possible. People like to say that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, but it can be, if you would reasonably *expect* there to be evidence -- if I tell you all the time about [my girlfriend from Canada](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GirlfriendInCanada), yet she never ever shows up, not even to events like weddings and funerals where you might expect me to bring a +1, eventually you're going to believe I'm lying. Sure, you could be wrong, and I could one day show up with said girlfriend, but years of experience of her not showing up should actually count as evidence *against* her existence.

So, similarly, there hasn't been any evidence for anything supernatural, ever. If there really were evidence, we would've expected at least *one* of the many stories that skeptics have investigated would turn out to be true. James Randi ran a challenge for decades offering a cash prize (topping out at a million dollars) to be given to anyone who could prove anything supernatural under laboratory conditions; in the decades this challenge was running, no one even made it past the preliminary trials.

Because, to quote [Tim Minchin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhGuXCuDb1U): ""Throughout history, *every* mystery *ever* solved has turned out to be: Not Magic.""

Now, you might be talking about a Deistic god, one that never interferes with reality and so wouldn't leave any mark on reality. A short answer is, sure, and my girlfriend from Canada really doesn't like warm weather or latitudes below the 49th parallel. You can always make up an excuse to make the thing seem technically possible, and it's always going to sound like desperate special pleading.

But, more seriously, I think we do actually have evidence against consciousness (and especially minds) existing outside of brains: Everything we know about consciousness suggests that it's physical. We can alter our consciousness with physical drugs, and not even necessarily hard ones -- as soon as I'm done here, I'm about to have some coffee, in anticipation of it altering my mind. More dramatically, we've known since at least [Phineas Gage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage) that removing part of the brain (he survived an iron rod going through his head) can *significantly* alter one's personality. Not just personality -- there's a part of the brain that, if damaged, will make it so you believe everyone you see is an impostor. It's specifically vision, too -- there was a patient who, if he saw his mother, would *insist* it wasn't his mother, but he was fine talking to her on the phone.

I could go on and on... Sure, we could turn out to be wrong and there could be another kind of consciousness that exists outside of brains, that just happens to resemble what goes on in our brains in some way, but is it really reasonable to treat this as an actual possibility?

I'm going to go ahead and assume no such thing exists.

I'll be happy to learn if I'm wrong, but in the mean time, consider: You probably had no problem saying Russell's Teapot doesn't exist, just as you probably have no problem saying there are no fairies or unicorns or elves or Darth Vader or Santa Claus. You can't prove Santa doesn't exist, but nobody says they're a Santa-agnostic. So when you say you're an agnostic about gods, you're still giving religion special treatment, maybe even in your own mind -- if you truly don't believe gods are more likely than Santa, then you should be as willing to say ""God doesn't exist"" as you are to say ""Santa isn't real.""",1546300971

"hackintosh","t5_2quen","For the past 6 months, I've been running this setup and everything seems to be working fine except for USB 3.0 speeds. Getting around 30 mb/s write and 100-150 mb/s read (I just created a custom SSDT but haven't rebooted yet. Will update with results). I attached pictures below with system info, FB-Patcher, Intel Power Gadget, and Geekbench scores

I'm running High Sierra 10.13.6 with APFS and Trim enabled (I read that this is not ideal for hackintosh but seems fine for me. Boot times are long but not more than 1 minute.)

**SETUP SPECS:**

\- Mobo: Asus Prime Z370-A

\- CPU: i7 8700k @ 4.7

\- RAM: 32 GB

\- GPU: EVGA 1080 8GB

\- WIFI/BLT: BCM94331 with PCIe adapter

\- 4 Monitors

\- Storage: ADATA XPG 480GB M.2 as the main drive

**WORKING:**

So far everything seems to be working fine.

\- iMessage/Facetime works- Handoff works (used Continuity tool to activate it)- iGPU works when using Final Cut Pro and stuff like that.- Power management seems to work fine.- HDMI/DP audio works sometimes. After a few reboots, audio through HDMI or DP doesn't appear.- AUX/3.5mm audio port works great

**NOT WORKING:**

Not really sure yet. I tried to research working builds similar to mine and added everything they had.

\- SSDT patch still not 100% sure it's correct. In FB-Patcher, I had ports PRT2 and PRT4 but didn't know how to add them to the SSDT. (See screenshots of FB-Patcher)

I would really appreciate if someone could look through my EFI files and config to see if everything is correct (I did remove the Serial # and UUID but they are there in clover). Thank you so much for your help!

EDIT: I did patch the framebuffer with FB-Patcher and iGPU seems to work great!

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","Me and the OP as far as I can tell we are with the PLOT, this is not our head-canons, this is something CONFIRMED in the narrative since nothing has been shown that proves otherwise. How do I get my own advice if I'm with the plot ???? You're the ONLY one here creating ""facts"" that were NOT shown and don't exist, ALL things you can tell are things that have been shown, things that ODA wanted to show, and besides Robin running away from WG EVERYTHING she did to survive was to be an Assassin and nothing more than that. Like I and the OP have said millions of times, if the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãOda was to show that there was something like that Robin had to use her own body he would have shown, given hints or pointed to it, like OP well quoted as Oda did with Hancock, as Oda did with Viola. 
It's no use wanting to insist on something based on your OWN theory, what was shown is CANON, what has NOT been shown is theory of your head, something NON-CANON, and certainty, obviously Oda didn't want to pass that Robin used her own body to leave of a situation, otherwise this would have been at least quoted or given as Foreshadowed. The Fact is simple, it is or is not, in the case of Robin is not,  she is VIRGIN until Oda proves otherwise, until Oda says otherwise, until there's some EVIDENCE that proves this, which will never appear, because this NEVER happened. If it appears it's because she's going to end up with Zoro, or Franky or someone that she'll met in  the future which I doubt, Robin will end up alone but that's another matter.

&gt;Furthermore, why is it an absolute must that it just has to be shown, suggested or even foreshadowed just to prove that Nami and Robin aren't virgins?  

I've been following One Piece since 2003 and whenever Oda wants to give an additional information about a character it's all officially released on databooks or SBS, things out of confirmations or official facts it's just non-Canon speculation. In Robin's case everything she had to do to survive was to be an Assassin and nothing more than that. Apart from that fact, without any hint, with nothing suggesting that Robin had to use other means(her body) to get out of a situation or to deceive the organizations that she worked for, it's just empty fan theories.  

The biggest fact when she's in an office with weapons and telling the leader of an organization ""I'm 16, I do anything."" It's obvious that she was dealing with an assassination case and later she fooled the organization in order to escape, but into the heads of people like you ""she had sex with the leader of the organization to gain his trust and then sold him to the Marines"". WTF

&gt;why is it an absolute must that it just has to be shown, suggested or even foreshadowed just to prove that Nami and Robin aren't virgins?  

Because out of something that is suggesting or insinuating that Nami or Robin used their bodies to survive, you have no basis, you can not prove because don't exist anything to support that they are not virgens, you can not say that Nami and Robin are not virgins because there are absolutely nothing suggesting that , outside of it becomes theory, a fact that didn't happen, if it had happened, would have been shown or suggested in the narrative and with Robin the only thing that was confirmed is that she was an assassin.

&gt;Just because it was hinted with Hancock and Viola, who both were in different situations than Robin and Nami to begin with ? 

Viola's situation is not that different from Robin and Nami's situation, Robin was protecting herself from WG, Nami was protecting herself from Arlong and Viola from DoFlamingo (although maybe she might have felt something for DoFlamingo because Oda used the word ""passion""). 

And yes, something like that, as Robin and Nami using their bodies in order to survive, is DEFINITELY something that Oda would point out in the narrative as he always pointed out with other characters. Again out of this is just YOUR speculation, something non-canon that doesn't exist.

&gt;meaning it can still be open for interpretation. 

There is no open fact in the narrative, there is NOTHING, there is no hole in the narrative, what you are doing is THEORIZING, theorizing is different from interpreting an open fact in the narrative. There's no room for interpretations in Robin's background, you're theorizing. 

&gt;Before and after 16-year-old Robin told that guy she would do anything, NO ONE knows EVERYTHING she did

Really HOW POOR can be your imagination??? she said ""I do anything"" It's exactly what I've said earlier:
 
she's in an office with weapons and telling the leader of an organization ""I'm 16, I do anything."" It's obvious that she was dealing with an assassination case and later she fooled the organization in order to escape from the marines, but into the heads of people like you ""she had sex with the leader of the organization to gain his trust and then sold him to the Marines"". Go back to the hentai series. 

&gt;How the hell is that the end of the discussion when his so-called proof wasn't proof at all? 

I think you're reversing the roles here. Who is claiming  something that has not happened in the plot is you, who has to show some proof that they are not a virgin is YOU. OP is with the plot, NOTHING supposing that Robin and Nami are not virgins was suggested as I have said millions of times, it's you who is stating that they are not virgins, it's you who have to prove something. They are virgins until something proves otherwise which will never be proven because doesn't exist anything in the plot that support this theory. ",1546300975

adjective

1.

relating to France or its people or language.

noun

1.

the Romance language of France, also used in parts of Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada, in several countries of northern and western Africa and the Caribbean, and elsewhere.

2.

BRITISH

short for¬†French vermouth.

So as you can see a dirty Quebecer is related to the French people as shown in the definition of the word French. On est practiquement des cousins! Tabarnac, c'est amusant. 

Here's another definition for you of a French-Canadian.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Where did you get the stat that 100 people pee (and poop) enough in 4 hours to fill a portapotty?  

&amp;#x200B;

\&gt;[""Standard porta potty units come with 60-gallon waste tanks ](https://www.gotugo.com/blog/porta-potty-rentals/5-common-porta-potty-myths-part-ii/)with options to add to waste tanks that hold up to 250 additional gallons of waste. These tanks are designed to fit just about any plumbing configuration. Just how far will 250 gallons get you? Well, a 250-gallon tank should be enough to meet the needs of a 10-man working crew over a 40-hour workweek. Plus, most porta potty renters are also available to come by and empty it or swap it out for a new one as needed.[""](https://www.gotugo.com/blog/porta-potty-rentals/5-common-porta-potty-myths-part-ii/)

&amp;#x200B;

One gallon = 3785 mL

[The normal range for 24-hour urine volume is 800 to 2,000 milliliters per DAY (with a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day).](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/003425.htm)

So each person pees 1/4 to 1/2 gallon a day.  If one porta-potty holds 60 gallons, wouldn't that be 240-120 people a day?

[According to this public toilet calculator website,](https://tardishire.co.uk/toilet-hire/tardis-toilet-calculator/)

"ChapoTrapHouse","t5_3ezs3","I understand that, as it is, sports are a big part of the college experience.  I went to a D2 school in undergrad that had really good football, volleyball, and basketball teams (we were actually voted ""best road trip in college basketball""), and I'm currently in grad school at a D1 school that lives and breathes basketball.  Being an alumnus of a particular school is probably the biggest part of my father-in-law's self-identity.  So I get it; I'm just saying that that's not the only conceivable system, and that it's actually incredibly atypical.  Whether or not it's better or worse than something like the Canadian or European model is subjective, of course, and would vary person to person.  I'd be really interested in seeing comparative data on college satisfaction between American students and students elsewhere in the world.

And yeah, I agree that administrative costs are a larger single factor than athletic costs, but a) I don't think you can solely disentangle the two (a lot of the athletic costs ARE administrative costs), and b) I think they're symptoms of the same problem.  As schools offer more and more things beyond just education and research, that necessitates, to some degree, more administrative staff.  Administration being what it is, a necessary 5% increase in administrative costs winds up being an actual 10% increase in administrative costs, extrapolated over two dozen different things that require administration, adding up to more and more beauracracy and more and more cost.  I think the cleanest solution is just to cut back on all of it.  Not just athletics.",1546300978

I was only going to talk about in my future videos what GTO is and its comparison to GOATS and why GOATS exists in that context. Especially in the pro scene its zen GOATS vs zen GOATS on a lot of maps, so understanding that two players are trying to play perfect overwatch, the answer is to get the most value out of every cooldown possible, and how one misplayed cooldown can swing your probability of winning the fight out of your favour. Also a video explaining about using information, and how information is king to play exploitative. I was just going to create parallels between the games and obviously there is never going to be an exact science between comparing two drastically different games, and just create a more statistically minded approach to GOATS cooldown usage in high SR scrims/OD/Contenders games.

&amp;#x200B;

In my mind GOATS is the equivalent of trying to play balanced poker, trying to be unexploitable, and exploiting the opponent who isnt playing balanced (GOATS). There is a correlation there and I'd like to explore it.

&amp;#x200B;

As for the Mental Game of Poker, that is essentially my bible and going forward I want to make some of his stuff known to the OW community, because it really is valuable to people who struggle with mental game, where you will know if you play on ladder there are a lot of those cases. 

&amp;#x200B;

I know this video was a big work in progress and unclear, but I have many more ideas that will be more nuanced and clear and concise as this was just my entry and trying to get comfortable and learning how to convey my ideas on video.

&amp;#x200B;

I know variance isnt anywhere close to the same in poker as in overwatch, its moreso talking about the statistics behind sample sizes and not being tilted over small loss streaks causing the loss streaks to be much worse. The title and ideas could use some work in the video, but always room for improvement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for your input I agree with most of what you say, I just needed to better convey what my goals were in coaching, and what information I want to share.

Nope, touched the officer. Does it matter what happened before the video started? Nope, touchy the officer.

Hayward‚Äôs movement -  the way he dribbled to his spot before pulling up from the mid-range, the way he backed up behind the three point line to gather momentum, his style driving to the basket - all looked so familiar.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","To be clear: I'm not saying that any exercise will magically eliminate all extra calories.

If the LPT said: running 26 extra miles a week and eating 8000 calories extra a week (or even 6000 or 5000 extra) will cause you to to gain weight, then I would agree. 

The point I'm making is that for an average person, starting from a sedentary lifestyle, those 26 extra miles a week running will increase your BMR (probably roughly in the ballpark of around 150-200 extra a day), which will compensate for the 900 calorie gap in the extra food vs the extra exercise.

Your diet in college was foul enough to give back the calories you spent biking + the extra calories that were being burnt at rest caused by the exercise. That is why you gained weight.",1546300981

On some virtual instruments it‚Äôs plausible that the higher note will phase cancel some of the harmonics of the lower note and there will be actually less harmonic sound when 2 notes are played compared with 1 note.

I‚Äôve heard a piece analyzed where some instrument like the horn has the melody, a couple flutes double it an octave up, and then a piccolo has the same line a perfect fifth above that. And of course it all sounds like a single unison line. Even though the flutes and piccolo are playing fairly loudly, they match the harmonics of the horn so well that they are basically inaudible.

For obvious reasons Luxembourg and Gibraltar are not really relevant in the same way we don't usually talk about Monaco and San Marino when discussing certain economic rankings.  The others are oil producing countries who have high CO2 outputs for different reasons.

Per capita absolutely matters.  It brings things into proportion.  Do you really think it's fair to compare the US' or EU's CO2 total output to Tuvalu or Vatican City?  Also, China and India both have the resources and clearly the drive to begin massive transitions away from fossil fuels.  Also, we're already seeing the effects of climate change right now.  And we have about 12 years according to the latest reports to avoid the 1.5 C rise which will cause cataclysmic levels of damage that most developing nations neither contributed in large part to, nor have the resources to adapt to.  The global energy use is already going up.  However the United States has the ability to also invest, along with China, in the development of LDCs' energy sectors to discourage use of fossil fuels.  Also, you keep saying ""inferior reactors"" without actually addressing how they are inferior, relative to what, or what developments could be made in the immediate future.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","This isn‚Äôt as non partisan as it seems, there are fundamental assumptions being made about the importance of debt that are highly debatable. I also think it‚Äôs misleading when the vast majority of this is m4a, to act like transferring that from the private sector to the public sector is more expensive or concerning somehow. It‚Äôs cheaper, even by conservative analyses, and comparing public spending in the US in the past and saying it would be a record % of GDP is neither surprising nor particularly meaningful. OFC transferring the private insurance sector to the govt would make govt spending at its highest point. It would make more sense to compare to the other developed countries with single payer - what‚Äôs their % of GDP in taxes and in govt spending? Why would you compare to the US decades ago? Unless you‚Äôre trying to make the numbers look bad. And I think this is probably their thing here, because it‚Äôs an institute about debt. That‚Äôs not a politically neutral position - being concerned about debt in this way, and it almost always belies a larger conservative ideology. I don‚Äôt claim to know but it raises red flags the way they do this analysis. 

The other part of this is that *this wasn‚Äôt a proposed budget*. This is their think tank (TPC is centrist but still ideologically biased) adding up all of the numbers and policy proposals from Bernie‚Äôs website. 

Lastly, the entire rest of the developed world has pretty much all of these things, certainly the biggest ticket items. They can afford it, why can‚Äôt we? We‚Äôre richer. Military spending is the only excuse, and yes it can and desperately needs to be cut. Sanders has advocated for that but I‚Äôm not sure if there‚Äôs specific proposals, and I‚Äôm a little skeptical that his foreign policy would match with that, because he‚Äôs actually surprisingly status quo in terms of maintaining the empire as far as I can tell. This analysis mentions no notable cutting. 

The truth is that saying Bernie is a left wing trump was a lazy lie propagated by conservative Dems desperate to smear Bernie with something because their actual criticism: ‚Äúwe oppose left wing economics and want the US to be more conservative than all of Europe‚Äù is at odds with their rhetoric and public sentiment. Bush‚Äôs plan of starting 2 wars, exploding domestic and military spending, while cutting taxes, was unrealistic. But that didn‚Äôt stop it. Suddenly realism and debt matters when the money might go to working people, but when it‚Äôs lit on fire in the middle east or dumped on rich people it‚Äôs an issue of necessity. I‚Äôm to the right of Bernie but I‚Äôll support every single one of these because the other option is still insolvency, but with an incredibly poor populace when we reach it, or one that‚Äôs accustomed to having basic economic needs met universally. 

This is why I prefer warren though, I think her policies tend to be more well designed and she‚Äôs a better technocrat. Bernie‚Äôs answer to every problem is transfer it to the public sector. But she‚Äôs so reticent to face down corruption. No one will be able to do anything majorly positive without openly calling out both parties, their donors, and incumbents for being corrupt pieces of shit. Effective aggressive use of the bully pulpit and political mobilization is a prerequisite for anything beyond edge tinkering. ",1546300984

&gt;Men have been telling us who we are all our lives. They try to do it with scholarship, with religion, with psychiatry. When all else fails, they use humor to tell us- and each other- who and what we are. What we have seen here today is yet another instance in which men, LAUGHING with one another, are telling us who THEY think we are.    
&gt;  
&gt;Men have NEVER been able to show us ourselves. We are coming into a time and place as women in which we can show one another who we are. (BURST OF APPLAUSE) All right? Let men tell each other what THEY THINK of women. Let US tell you who we are.""

Also [this website](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) is pretty good. The author writes a neural network from scratch using Python. If you want a video explanation 3blue1brown has a video series on it.

With that said, I think it's a super solid song and the choreo is gorgeous. I wasn't expecting a lot and think this is great - I can only hope that their Japanese music continues to be this good. ",1546300988

We grew up in the prosperity of the 90s and graduated into the recession. We aren't the part of the generation that still mostly lives at home tho. We are kind of a hybrid. 

There was another generational term thrown out for us a while back but i dont recall what it was, but im of the opinion thst it was ment to divide the millennial generation, which is the largest generation in history. Our numbers are scary.

That makes sense, I can see how it could aggravate a claim, but not affect liability. On that note, though, are you aware if there's case law for OP's original question about taking measures at all, even prior to a loss, demonstrating an awareness of a hazard and affecting liability in that way? 

You're definitely going to know more about this than I ever would.

I see some variation on this comment every time this issue comes up. So you're saying you support trans rights, but you feel the need to point out that trans people ""aren't really"" the gender they identify as. But that distinction isn't useful or important. What you believe to be biologically true has no bearing on how someone expresses their gender, independent of biological sex. 

Here's the thing, being supportive means not taking these opportunities to flex your stance on who isn't really what. Be glad your sex matches your preferred gender and maybe stop pointing this out? It's potentially really harmful for folks just trying to find their place in the world.",1546300992

The Dems she was talking about weren‚Äôt fucking *corporate* or in the pocket of Wall Street: they were red/purple state Dems with big rural populations, which have a lot of rural banks that found some regulations hard to comply with &amp; that affected their services. You can still disagree with those Dems‚Äô position &amp; argue against Dodd-Frank changes but I thought the characterization of moderate Dems as bought by Wall Street was some top-notch bullshit.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","Hi Everyone,

I just recently joined reddit. I am 22, and I am searching for my ideal skin regimen. I have been to numerous dermatologists and they always seem to throw prescriptions at me as opposed to helping me learn about my skin.

I have dry, sensitive skin. I live in the Pacific Northwest. Six months ago I started using the Rodan &amp; Fields SOOTHE regimen. Since starting the SOOTHE regimen my face has been far less oily, previously I had worn powder everyday to control shine but I no longer need it now. I originally went on the SOOTHE regimen because my skin was breaking out, I have a tendency to get cystic acne. The SOOTHE regimen didn't really help with the cystic acne at all, but a month and a half ago I switched to the BC pill I was on three years ago (my skin was clear then) and that seems to be helping so far. 

So! I apologize for this crazy long post - but I am hoping for some skin experts to give me some recommendations. I am going off the SOOTHE regimen because I just cannot afford it, and because I don't feel it was really a miracle for my skin. While my skin is more moisturized and less oily, I am also getting little whiteheads and surface acne that I have never gotten before. 

***- My current regimen -***

*SOOTHE Mineral Sunscreen*

**Evening:**

*Dove Dermaseries Dry Skin Relief Facewash*

*SOOTHE Sensitive Skin Treatment*

*SOOTHE Moisture Replenishing Cream*

*Occasional:*

Once a week I exfoliate with olive oil + sugar

*\*\*I added this acne wash recently because I felt that I was still having a fair amount of cystic acne as well as little stuff like whiteheads and small surface pimples that I've never had before. The was does seem to help with the little stuff, but it also causes some stinging and dryness that I don't think is productive. I'm wondering if maybe I just need a toner.* 

*\*\* I recently switched out my sensitive skin treatment with: CeraVe Baby Moisturizing Lotion - Contains similar ingredients, however I am getting tiny red spots and white heads all over my face so I don't think that is going to be a good product for my skin.* 

Prior to starting all of this (around 9 months ago) I was taking 50mg of Spironolactone daily (per my dermatologist), I used Johnsons Baby Wash for face wash, the clinique 2 toner, and Aveeno 15spf daily lotion. My skin was relatively clear because of the Spironolactone, however it was very oily and dry. I chose to go off the spironolactone because I had been on it for three years, and I want my skin to be clear because I am taking good care of it and it's healthy - rather than just taking a prescription that doesn't really solve the underlying issues. 

I want to find a regimen that is affordable, with quality ingredients, that will keep my skin protected and healthy.

You mentioned (4) that I might be better off using less flower to micro dose. Wouldn't that also produce less vapor (or less THC  in the vapor) per hit, or am I misunderstanding something? If I can pop 0.1g instead of 0.3g in there adn get the same amount of high from the same number of hits, that doesn't really make sense to me.

Also noting that you said (1) that you do about half as many hits from your vape than you would a joint and you get the same high, I am clearly doing something wrong where I am using so much flower and getting so little effect...

As for tobacco (5), I've seen several videos of people using loose tobacco in a dry herb vape and they tend to produce very poofy clouds. Watching the video you linked me, I'd say my vape produces very similar cloud to the FlowerMate, further suggesting that they are very similar is build and function.

If we assume that the Utillian is effectively a FlowerMate, would there be any suggestions you can offer that might make my expereience with it better? Is there a certain temperature that is ideal for this system, a certain airflow resistance that is ideal, maybe a warm up time or different expectations? Buddy in the video did node that the FlowerMate's first draw was ""very terpy"" which I assume means has flavour but little vapor. Perhaps this is expected and I need to adjust what I think shoudl be happening with my unit?",1546300995

I really think what's hanging most people up here is the fact that it's a fetish and it's a weird fetish.  I get what you're saying but I believe for 99% of people if it had been sex they would've let it go and he wouldn't have lost his career.

A fetish is just that you are attracted to something sexually that most people are not.  That makes being gay a fetish too.  People laughing at his ""weird fetish"" are being very hypocritical in my opinion.",1546300996

The Cygnus spacecraft is an American automated cargo spacecraft developed by Orbital Sciences and now built and launched by Northrop Grumman as part of NASA's Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) developmental program. It is launched by Northrop Grumman's Antares rocket or ULA's Atlas V and is designed to transport supplies to the International Space Station (ISS) following the retirement of the American Space Shuttle. Since August 2000 ISS resupply missions have been regularly flown by Russian Progress, as well as by the European Automated Transfer Vehicle, and the Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle. With the Cygnus spacecraft  and the SpaceX Dragon, NASA seeks to increase its partnerships with domestic commercial aviation and aeronautics industry.Cygnus is the Latinized Greek word for swan and a northern constellation.

***

**SpaceX Dragon**

Dragon is a reusable cargo spacecraft developed by SpaceX, an American private space transportation company. Dragon is launched into orbit by the company's Falcon 9 two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle.

During its maiden flight in December 2010, Dragon became the first commercially built and operated spacecraft to be recovered successfully from orbit. On 25 May 2012, a cargo variant of Dragon became the first commercial spacecraft to successfully rendezvous with and attach to the International Space Station (ISS).

***

**Dragon 2**

Dragon 2 is a class of reusable spacecraft currently in development by American aerospace manufacturer SpaceX, designed as the successor to the Dragon cargo spacecraft. The spacecraft are designed for launches atop a Falcon 9 Block 5 rocket and a splashdown return. In comparison to its predecessor, it has larger windows, new flight computers and avionics, redesigned solar arrays, and a modified outer mold line. The spacecraft will be produced in two variants, Crew Dragon 2, a human-rated capsule capable of carrying up to seven astronauts, and Cargo Dragon 2, an updated replacement for the original Dragon.

"de","t5_22i0","&gt; die Kraftwerksbetreiber werden quasi gezwungen zu liefern, damit das Netz stabil bleiben kann. 

Das ist eine interessante Formulierung. Strom zu verkaufen ist deren Gesch√§ftsmodell, das sind ja keine Wassersammler die sich freuen wenn die Speicher m√∂glichst voll sind, die freuen sich stattdessen wenn sie m√∂glichst viel Strom produzieren und m√∂glichst teuer verkaufen k√∂nnen.

&gt;  Solche Situationen sind fr√ºher 2-3 mal pro Winter eingetroffen. Die letzten zwei Jahre, mussten die Wasserkraftwerke sooft eingreifen, dass Mitte Winter kein Restwasser in den Stauseen mehr drin war.

Das stimmt nicht. Energy-Charts hat auch daf√ºr eine tolle Statistik: https://energy-charts.de/storage_de.htm?year=all

Wenn du unten die Anzeige ganz nach links und nach rechts schiebst, so dass bis 2014 alle Speicherst√§nde angezeigt werden wirst du sehen dass der √ºbliche Verlauf immer in etwa gleich ist und dass die Speicher erst im April/Mai herum ihre Tiefstst√§nde erreichen. (Am besten auch noch √ñsterreich und Deutschland oben rechts wegklicken damit du nur die Schweizer Speicherst√§nde siehst.)

Und genau so soll es funktionieren, daf√ºr sind die Speicher ja da, dass man die Energie √ºber den ganzen Winter hinweg abrufen kann. Aus diesem Grund wird auch gerade eine zus√§tzliche Leitung nach Norwegen gelegt, die haben ein Vielfaches der Speicherkapazit√§t wie Schweiz, √ñsterreich und Deutschland zusammen.

Du stellst das so dar als w√§re das irgendeine Notfallma√ünahme, dabei ist das *by Design*. Darum macht man das ja und darum baut man die Speicher.

&gt; Installierte Leistung ist √ºbrigens auch nicht die Leistung die man tats√§chlich nutzen kann. 

Korrekt aber hier geht es um die tats√§chlich erzeugte Energiemenge, nicht um installierte Leistung. Von der installierten Leistung her gibt es bereits doppelt soviel Wind- und PV als Kohle und Atom.

&gt; H√§ufig wird viel produziert wenn man gar nichts braucht, dann werden mit geringem Wirkungsgrad Speicher vollgepumpt.

Nein, das passiert nicht h√§ufig. Das passiert eigentlich gar nicht. Es gab bisher noch keinen Tag in Deutschland in dem mehr erneuerbare Energie erzeugt als verbraucht wurde. Es gibt teilweise F√§lle wo Windr√§der abgeregelt werden m√ºssen aber das liegt in erster Linie daran dass andere Kraftwerke (vor allem Braunkohle) nicht weit genug runterregeln k√∂nnen und somit die Netze verstopfen.

Und ja, Strom in Speicherkraftwerke zu speichern ist erneut der Sinn der Sache, keine Notfallma√ünahme um irgendwie Strom wegzubekommen. Fr√ºher hat man in der Nacht den Atomstrom in Speicherkraftwerken f√ºr den n√§chsten Tag zwischengeparkt, nun eben immer √∂fter den Windstrom. Der Wirkungsgrad ist bei Pumpspeicherkraftwerken √ºbrigens nicht gering sondern mit rund 80% relativ gut im Vergleich zu praktisch allen anderen Energiespeichern.

Aber ja, es wird auch noch in Zukunft den Bedarf an kalorischen Kraftwerken geben um Engp√§sse auszugleichen. Allerdings ist es eben etwas anderes ob ein Kraftwerk 300 Volllaststunden l√§uft und dabei die Umwelt und Atmosph√§re verpestet oder eben 7.000+ Volllaststunden wie jetzt. Wenn wir die Kraftwerke nur noch ab und zu ein paar Stunden anwerfen m√ºssten w√§re schon sehr viel gewonnen. 

Klimaschutz ist nicht bin√§r, es geht nicht um alles oder nichts. Selbst wenn man ""nur"" 90% Erneuerbare Energie schafft und f√ºr 10% weiterhin fossile Energietr√§ger verbrennen muss w√§re schon viel gewonnen! Und bis wir mal bei 90% sind wird ohnehin noch einige Zeit vergehen und vielleicht hat man bis dahin dank neuer Technologie und Kostensenkungen bei Speichern schon wieder ganz andere M√∂glichkeiten um die letzten 10% vielleicht doch noch anders zu l√∂sen.",1546301000

This is hardly an example of racial bias. In fact if we look at 2018 as a whole, Ember started the year as NXT champ, Baszler won the NXT title twice, Sane won the NXT title, Nia won the Raw title, and Asuka won the SD title. 2018 will close tonight with 2/3 of the women's titles being held by non Caucasian women.

If you say you don't like how black people look, then you are saying all black people look the same which just isn't true. Not even having a dark skin can make you ""black"", because there are plenty light skinned persons that look black.

I understand why people can find the lack of attraction racist. For a long time, black people have been considered ugly and physically inferior to lighter skinned races. When you say you don't want to be with someone because they're \[insert race here\] , people are gonna raise an eyebrow. It sounds like you're saying something is wrong with being \[insert race here\]. If I say a race is unattractive, I'm gonna sound racist.

I've heard the word 'talented' so many fucking times it makes me sick. It honestly seems like my BPD friend can't be creative without surrounding themselves with others who they can draw inspiration off. Heck, when I worked on a writing exercise they wanted to critique, they started to call me their 'muse'. So a part of her is cognoscent of what she's doing. It's still shitty though, being treated like an object they can get something out of.

Get you wild, make you leave

I'm a little much for everyone

The truth is I am a toy that people enjoy

1. Frank has never had any excuses when doing a prank or video, where as Eric Andre has always had the ability to say ""this is for tv"". All the possible repercussions land squarely on him and him alone.
2. Frank has only ever had himself and a few friends to pull off his stunts, where as Eric Andre has a whole crew of people.
3. All the money needed to make a Filthy Frank video comes out of Frank's pocket, Eric Andre has the studio paying for his pranks.
4. Frank doesn't care at all for what's pc or socially acceptable. Repeatedly using language like ""gay"",""faggot"", and ""retard"" in his videos. 

In the end, I think it comes down to the idea that the persona of Filthy Frank was created with the idea in mind that he is a literal character. He's like chaos, cringe, and disgust incarnated into an actual person. The persona of Eric Andre is limited to just being a dude on a tv show willing to embarrass himself.

This has nothing to do with rule violations, it just means that your account is either too new, or doesn't have enough karma. We have a treshold to prevent spammers from posting on /r/dankmemes.

But first off I have to defend bungie on that first its the players leaving prior to match starting sonits the community. I know I would rather go into a match 3v4 then 7 ppl be returned to orbit right before the match starts to wait on another . Idk about you but I hate baboon. Cabbage. All that. And it would feel that way. Now onto my next big one and i agrue this all the time. Every class has op something . if nova warp gets nurfed it would make the game unbalanced . here is why. Hunters have shards. Thats op. I've seen ppl have 6-8 supers in a quickplay match. That's op. Titans have one eyed mask. Thats there op. What does worlock have? Nova warp...thats it. No good exotic. Nothing thats game changing. Just nova warp. Take that away and once again..warlock will be unusable. The only way I can even accept a nurf for nova warp and make it somewhat on par with other classes is take away the healing from a kill but give them an exotic to be able to get that back. The ppl that complain about nova warp are the ones who dont have shards or one eyed mask. Sorry for the rant. Nothing against you. But the community used to be better back in d1.

Her actions in AFFC prove this. I think it makes more sense that she was relying on the people around her who care about her (Tywin, Jaime, Kevan) to handle whatever would occur were shit to hit the fan rather than handling it herself, as this is more in line with her tendency to be a much weaker more ineffectual person than she thinks she is

B: Idt she started playing it loose with Jaime until he came back from the Riverlands and wasn't a dickhead anymore

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

1. Career goals- identify what you like to do and set a reasonable time frame to achieve it. Always assume you are going to have to care for yourself. So education towards a career is vital. 
BYU likely is not a good choice 
2. Work to support yourself now in a job that gives you insight to your eventual career 
3. Relationships. Most Mormon women you age would have birthed a litter. There will be a time and a place.  This isn‚Äôt it. Hence dating and courtship with Mormons is going to be a jagged edge- their expectations and your goals will clash.
4. If spiritual nourishment is important to you find a church community- explore and observe.

Our (We use communist pronouns here) community rules are close to free for all. Lord Flash and I made some up on the bus a while ago when we made this sub. If I remember correctly, and correct me if I'm wrong, but they were effectively as follows:

Post things you find that you think is interesting

Post things you find that you think other people would find interesting 

Keep memes to a minimum, or at least have them be related/funny/interesting

Info is nice, pictures are nice, videos are nice

*all the statements below I just made up*

Expanding the knowledgebase is always ideal, ie youtube channels that other people may not know about, or things that other people have just never seen before

Bikes are cool, puns are fantastic, book recommendations are highly welcome 

Whenever possible, puns regarding too, two, to, and 2 should be used

[And finally] (https://youtu.be/N_yJFLvmjJY)



You may have discovered the dorkstoobot. This was something flash was experimenting with, and as a way of consolidating stuff from dorks2.

Flash and I were planning some type if big reveal, but you were two clever. If you haven't told Craigiest already, we might be able to spring onto him. If you have, no worries.

If I'm not lazy, and if there are no changes to make (I think there defently are, let me know), I'll condense them and make them the official rules.


Welcome.

Have fun.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","&gt; You're right, I know my industry. I know people that this has happened to.

That's called ""an anecdote."" OP came here for legal advice.

&gt; The way it generally plays out, or threatens to play out, is that the artist (or more likely their attorney) will attach a dollar amount to the right to use their work, along with an estimate of damages from the unauthorized use of their work.

There is no attorney (and won't be one) and there's no non-laughable argument here that this use caused any damages whatsoever.

&gt;I do find it interesting that you seem to earnestly believe that ""whoops we already used it so it's too late now"" is any kind of defense for unauthorized use of intellectual property.

I didn't say that.  I said there won't be any inference with distribution because it's too late, and no judge would issue an injunction in this case anyway.

&gt;Based on what you're arguing here do you really think that Disney has no legal standing to make a claim against your production company

I'm saying the fact that you think that situation and this one bear any similarity whatsoever demonstrates why you shouldn't be trying to answer this question.

No, they have a license to the assets of Star Control 3, but not Star Control 1 or 2, which were not part of the bankruptcy auction. That's why they tried to pursue a licensing agreement with Paul and Fred and, when that didn't work out, presumably because they think the use of those assets is somehow essential to the success of SC:O, they began devising strategies to claim that they owned that material all along... either because Paul made SC1&amp;2 as a work-for-hire for Accolade, or because his licensing agreement with Accolade never expired (and hence the rights to SC1&amp;2 never reverted to him). This is all in court documents, BTW.

&gt; Furthermore, Stardock would literally lose the trademarks and copyright they paid a large sum for if they didn't defend it (see: letting GotP have free reign).

That's not how any of this works. Paul and Fred claimed to be the authors of Star Control. They were not using the mark in commerce, but nominatively. Trademarks can be lost via dilution... copyrights cannot.

&gt; This appears to be nothing but sour grapes after they sold their lovechild out in contract, and now realize they don't kerp full control.

Whereas the reality is that they see there's still a market for SC, want to make money off it themselves, and are incensed that this asshole thinks he can muscle them out of the materials they themselves made. Yeah, what assholes. :D",1546301015

"BokuNoHeroAcademia","t5_34a0h","When did I say I need a character to fundamentally change?You just admitted you have a low bar for character development. So my point was proven. I don't understand why you think it's nuanced and deep for her to ask the question, ""Who's gonna save the heroes?"" Unless your world view and ideology is that of a ten year old, I might be able to understand. You are further proving my point that you don't take in much media to make these claims. Her desire to save the heroes is a mere extension of saving people. It's the same shit. I don't understand how you don't get that. It's not a new direction. It's the same direction she's been taking but we got more insight to what she's thinking. You know what would be deep? If MHA verse talked about racism, like in X Men. You strawmanned me, assuming I want the character to go from good to bad. No. I reject the notion that this is character development at all. This is stupid. It's like a writer coming to a realization that he wants to write. Really, bud? You needed 200+ chapters to come to the conclusion that you wanna save people? Saving lives come with the job.

"crtgaming","t5_3c23m","What do you want to know about it? And what kind of TV you have? If it has a Component you could use 7-pin S-Video to Component get to get Component signal from the graphics card. And you could also get 720p or 1080i if your TV supports those resolutions.
If your TV doesn't have Component then the easies way would be S-Video, which is what I use.

If your TV is 4:3 then it would be really easy to get picture to it because you don't need any custom resolutions or scaling. On 4:3 SD TV's I'd recommend using 480 for NTSC or 576 for PAL. Many games etc. doesn't support 576 resolution, but 800x600 should look pretty good on most PAL TV's.

I use Xubuntu on the PC because on Windows I wasn't able to get custom resolutions (or scaling) working via S-Video even though it should be possible.

On Xubuntu I use xrandr to scale it, but I haven't found any way to switch to PAL 576i from NTSC 480i.

    xrandr --output TV-0 --mode 1024x768 --scale 1x0.75

"bestoflegaladvice","t5_34iym","So the ones I've seen have GPS tracking, so it could help if the car actually was just sitting in one spot because they'd see that he wasn't just driving around ignoring it. Although the courts aren't very lenient when it comes to these things. 

They also take a picture of you every time it prompts for a test. So at least in my state, having a random person blow for you will get you caught pretty quick. 

Here's the timing for the ones in my state...
You take the initial test to start your car, then it will prompt you for a test after your car is running for 5 minutes. After that it will go off about every 15 minutes of the car running. 

So he said 5-6 hours. At about 4 tests an hour that'd come to 20-24 missed tests. 21-25 including the first test after the 5 minute mark. So that's a lot less than 76. But, these systems aren't  perfect, like all technology, they glitch. I once got called out for missing 3 tests in one drive but, the thing is my drive to work was only about 10 minutes (you also have a 5 minute window to take each ""rolling retest""). After having them reset my system because of the violation, they concluded that it was a software glitch on there end. This wasn't the only issue I had with it by far. So it's possible there's something faulty with his. 

If you're wondering how the car could start itself without him testing in the first place, there's a 2
minute window after turning your car off to restart without having to blow. My remote start was disabled when my interlock was installed but, his might not be aftermarket. 

If I had to guess, I'd say he's probably fucked. Because like I said they aren't forgiving when it comes to interlock violations. He's responsible for anything and everything that happens with the interlock, even if someone else is driving. I'd hope they'd be a little understanding in this situation if he can provide solid evidence but, I wouldn't hold my breath. ",1546301018

Trust is a thing that, for me at least, takes *a lot* to grow back after you‚Äôve lied. With an emotionally unstable/manipulative person, there‚Äôs no telling what they‚Äôll lie about.

Mine lied about spending the night with a guy while we were still involved. Told me they‚Äôd only hung out casually, when she‚Äôd actually spent **days/overnight** at his house. That‚Äôs a pretty big deal. What‚Äôs worse, I already knew the truth when she was lying to my face. She seemed pretty genuine. Made me question if I was wrong, even though I had seen solid evidence of her being with him. She came up with a bullshit excuse basically ‚Äúprotecting my feelings‚Äù when I called her out during our breakup.

I have no idea what was truth or lies anymore. I think about all the things she disclosed to me about her past relationships (and believe me, she gave me like every detail, she never shut up about her past guys.) Who knows if any of it was true. I‚Äôm sure some was, but again, catching her lying to my face was enough for me to question *everything*. She had some pretty believable stories about her exes being shitty, like yelling at her or getting physical, one cheated on her when they had a house, etc. I‚Äôll never know, I just know she‚Äôs not worth it. It‚Äôs not a relationship you want, constantly wondering. Think about it. I‚Äôve never once lied to a partner. ",1546301018

All we need is better regulation of those stations and if they dont already putting things like what lights are currently installed or something like that even putting in a description if need be. Then the cop pulls this information up during the license and registration bit and if this product no longer seems the right one or doesn't fit the product info on file he writes the ticket and let's them go if it does match. And then they leave it up to the judge/court which you'll already have to go to anyway to decide in finality. The only problem with this is a cop would have to pull you over before absolute certainty but and I may be wrong in this I do believe (if you're not on the highway at least) a lot of cops will run your plates or something like that before pulling you over at which point the afore mentioned information would be shown and the officer can decide to stop you.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Its a perfect example of Gen X thinking

These monikers don't have exact definitions or assigned dates but when Coupland popularized that term he was comparing to 'Baby Boomers' (which is part of the gripe.. being compared) and the idea was they were an age group that was not the 'Hippy Era', the peak boomers, what we'd think of as a subculture, think 'Woodstock' think Vietnam Protests, long hair, beads and The Beatles mannnn!

He conceived 'Generation X' as the nephews, the nieces, the baby siblings. They were born too late and missed that subculture boom but they weren't the next generation either. They had no identity. They grew up in 'the shadow of baby boomers'. They were ""insert baby boomer"" they were Boomers kid brother, they were Boomers niece. Hence 'Generation X' which at the time was known as 'Generic product'. Another name could have been 'No Name Brand' generation. 

There is no set date on who 'Generation X' would be in terms of age but maybe consider youth subculture and again the idea is they would have came of age or entered college life post Vietnam. It was 1975 and the beatniks, the hippy freaks, the tie-dye had graduated. The 'Summer of Love' 1969 was passe. They would have been teenagers and the new youth as disco was the big new scene. Folk music was out, 'Betamax' was coming in. Playing Pong was the big crazy new sensation. Their youth culture would be the movie 'Jaws' and Jazz was out and Aerosmith and David Bowie would be their music. They'd watch 'The Carol Burnett Show' and 'Star Wars' would have been their big pop-culture super-phenomenon. Far from groovy nature clothing, beards and natural hairstyles - Generation X youth was burgundy polyester suits for grad and bright sharp and very unnatural garish, loud, styles, glitter and lasers for them. 

But Coupland also pointed out how they were still in the 'wake' of the peak Boomers and nothing they had was respected and was even deemed cheap and subpar, they never really enjoyed being the coolest. Their uncle Boomer or older brother was the real deal. Not that disco shit. 

And 'Generation X' was too young to really be part of the next identifiable generational subculture change which was the children of baby boomers: The 'MTV Generation' The New Wave, the Home Computer Generation and what we know as 'The 80s'. which didn't really start being 'The 80s' until about 1983/84. 

Louis CK would be closer to that generation. Which was even more 'generation X' than generation x in that they never even got a name other than 'The children of Baby Boomers' and 'Boomers Son or Daughter'. Nobody even gave them a moniker. I once heard 'The Alex P Keaton' generation which obviously didn't catch on but was from a TV show where that was a son of Baby Boomers.

Louis Ck is 51 years old. yes, he could be a straggler, a tail end Generation Xer but he's closer to the 'Kids of Baby Boomers'. He'd be about 18 years old when MTV and classic 80s pop culture was the big new thing. Generation Xers were his aunts and uncles or older brothers. 

But of course all of this can't really apply to Louis CK who's Mexican and wasn't really raised in that Boomer-GenX-MTV generations paradigm. His father, though Baby Boomer age, was a Jewish man from Eastern Europe when it was Soviet USSR so there wouldn't be that same idea. His parents aren't 'aging hippies' sorta thing. ",1546301022

&gt;I'd say, if you think Salmeron's original legal letter isn't way over the top and excessively threatening, then you've got serious issues.

I disagree. It's totally normal to have to deal with legal issues as a small business owner. Just because a letter comes from a lawyer and sounds officious doesn't mean it is automatically a threat or cause for panic. The dollar amounts mentioned ($100 and $500) are frankly a pittance from a business perspective, and she should have quickly realized that she had made a mistake but that it was fortunately easily resolved. If she was truly panicked by the letter, she should have taken it to her lawyer and gotten advice on the right course of action. 

AE and Marta both have repeatedly shown that they are/were out of their depth in even understanding the fundamentals of commercial use. Once Marta brought in AE to resolve a legal issue that *her business* faced, she was partly responsible for the actions that they took towards the photog on her behalf. This is a non-story if AE doesn't try to blacklist the artist, and Marta should frankly be furious with them for so badly mangling their response to a simple, minor dispute that had her business's name tied up in it.

Do I think she should have been forced to close her business or received threats? Certainly not. It's ridiculous that so many people now know the details of a $500 copyright dispute. But I don't think that absolves the mistakes that Marta and *especially* AE made in handling the situation.

&gt;The fact that they immediately removed the photo is already enough to resolve the issue, the donation was a nice gesture on top of that.

The damage was already done once it was posted to promote the brand. The photographer probably would have let it go (even without the $100 payment) if Marta just responds immediately, owns the mistake, and avoids all the other rigamarole.",1546301023

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","My point then would be that you wouldn't need to include the term atheist since there is no other kind of agnostic. It becomes redundant. 

Also, as for your original point: 

&gt;Incorrect. Atheism is a disbelief in any god. It is not ""god doesn't exist"", it's ""you say god exists, but I don't believe you"".

It's both. To some it's a lack of belief in response to the profession of a faith, but to others under Atheism it is the certainty that they see that there is no GOD.

When I profess the faith, the burden is on me to make my proof, I agree entirely.

When people come here and call my faith a lie and me a liar (I know and fear GOD more than a gun to my head from my personal life experiences, so I articulate it as the absolute truth) based on their own preconceptions, they argue as athiests. 

They would be the gnostic athiests you mentioned.",1546301026

Really sucks sometimes, because pretty much everyone tells me not to take it so seriously and some other people tell me to straight up wait. Which is true of course, I don't doubt it. I just really can't help but to keep pressuring myself...

Edit: Also some statistics some other guy posted down below about 60% of high school students having sex before they graduate, that's also kind of a big factor.

Not really no, the vast majority of guns are never used in crime, it‚Äôs like a tiny fraction of 1%. Over 300 million firearms, and a 11,000 firearm homicides (which is murders *and* justified homicides including police and self defense shootings, so the actual number is even lower).

Also, it‚Äôs gross to see a BS so protective of someone who made a promise to them and broke it.  They need to wake up and smell the coffee. Dig through every damn phone record and trace every single number if they need to.  In addition, based on my experience it might be because those of us that have been through it know the whole song, dance and circus. A WS gets away with everything while the BS is focused on the AP.  After digging through everything I realized my WS was the initiator. Seeking out people online, not telling them he was married or had kids. So those of us who have come out of denial and were able to finally objectively look at everything realized that the person we need to be upset with is the person that made the promise to us. Once that focus is correct then you can make an intelligent decision on saving your marriage or walking alway.

--
Must update every frame almost all the time?

Use Event Tick, Will be expansive, try to avoid using it as much as possible.

--
Need to update every frame.

Use Timelines, Pretty expensive but worth it.

--
Need to update every X units of time?

Use Timers, Scale based on interval, but generally pretty cheap.

When to use?

**Tick** - For super important stuff that are mission critical and must be checked every frame almost all the time.

**Timelines** - Nice for effects (visual stuff) and simple stuff that doesn't need to run all the time.

**Timers** - For everything else and as a cheaper alternative to Timelines.",1546301031

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","If you wanna put that theory to the test I‚Äôd love to hear back about how you‚Äôre feeling after a week of cutting out every source of glucose in your diet. I‚Äôm willing to bet the energy fluctuations and crashes happen because people were consuming a very large amount of processed sugar in their diet before hand. I don‚Äôt buy IQ increases since the way it‚Äôs measured is questionable. 

Another possible reason for afternoon crashes is dependence on caffeine and lack of sleep. Curious if those were controlled for. 

If your goal is weight loss or you have diabetes then perhaps keto is for you. Otherwise moderate intake of glucose is your best bet as a diet high in protein and fat like keto has its own set drawbacks like kidney disease since the body can only metabolise so much protein. 

In my personal experience cutting all glucose and I mean I wasn‚Äôt allowed apples because they had too much sugar ( fuck that diet) ended up depressing the brain (I was a sad boy for a bit). I‚Äôm curious if you have a different experience. Let me know if do. ",1546301031

"Cura","t5_2zvf2","TL;DR: You probably want to set `""nozzle_offsetting_for_disallowed_areas"": false` in your machine definition.

Let me first say that the dual extrusion in Cura as it works now has been designed for the Ultimaker 3 and S5. If your firmware works differently in how it positions the head w.r.t. the nozzle position and such, then you're going to need to do some trickery with the disallowed positions.

It's taking away from both sides of the build plate because the left nozzle can't reach the left part of your build plate, and the right nozzle can't reach the right part of your build plate. If you're using both extruders in your print, Cura will only allow you to place objects in the region that both extruders can reach.

If your print uses only one extruder (and be mindful that the platform adhesion extruder and support extruder also count if those features are active) then you should see that the grey zone disappears from one side.

Also be aware that Cura will assume (like the UM3) that the g-code has to be shifted with the inverse of the nozzle offset of the active extruder in order to end up aligned with the rest of the extruders. It will do that for you, so if you don't want Cura to do that, you're going to have to use a nozzle offset of 0 and work out the disallowed areas in a different way.

By default, Cura will assume that the range of motion that your printer can reach is limited by the motion of the print head. This causes the UM3 to have a ""build volume"" of 233mm wide, while each of the extruders can only reach a range of 215mm. The 215mm is the range that the print head can move, causing it to have a total width of 233mm using the nozzle offset. But each extruder that needs to be used in the print is going to limit the range of motion on one side, so you can never print something that is 233mm wide.

If your printer is limited by the size of the build plate rather than the motion range of the print head, this can be configured in the printer's definition file (not in the interface, sorry). You just need to set [`""nozzle_offsetting_for_disallowed_areas"": false`](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura/blob/master/resources/definitions/ultimaker_s5.def.json#L24) and the grey bars will disappear.",1546301032

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","&gt; Otherwise, I suspect that the game might have grown a bit too much since then to make this a possibility. 

With the way server meshing will work along with the way the background NPCs and economy is expected to be handled by a central server, this is looking more and more likely to be the case. I expect hosted servers to not be viable anymore, a very limited experience to only be feasible (1 or a few systems only, low number of NPCs, limited if not outright missing background economy) or short of renting a server farm if you have more than a handful of players to be the case if you want something closer to the official servers.

I don't know much about the scoring system because I'm not as into that aspect of the game, but from what I understand the scoring is *way more* about the landing being ""clean"" than what trick you did.  It's designed not to reward ""big tricks"" but instead to reward ""clean tricks"", and in particular consistent clean tricks, because landing clean is what builds up your score multiplier.

For me, the appeal of infinite air isn't the challenges or the scoring system, it's the user-made parks and literally just messing around making my own lines and stuff.  Very similar to how I played Steep, just with more emphasis on parks and in-depth trick controls and stuff.",1546301037

Bruce Campbell, Sarah Berry, Dan Hicks, Kassie Wesley DePaiva  
Director: Sam Raimi

&gt; Ashley Williams travels to a secluded cabin in the woods with his girlfriend Linda where they find a tape recording of a professor and a book of evil.

(*IMDb*)

**Critical reception:**
&gt; Rotten Tomatoes reports that 98% of 53 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 8\/10\. The site's consensus reads\: ""Evil Dead 2's increased special effects and slapstick-gore makes it as good ‚Äì if not better ‚Äì than the original."" On the similar website Metacritic, it holds a score of 69 out of 100, based on 12 critics, indicating ""generally favorable reviews"". Empire magazine praised the film, saying ""the gaudily gory, virtuoso, hyper-kinetic horror sequel uses every trick in the cinematic book"" and confirms that ""Bruce Campbell and Raimi are gods"". Caryn James of The New York Times called it ""genuine, if bizarre, proof of Sam Raimi's talent and developing skill."" Leonard Maltin originally rated the film with two stars, but later increased the rating to three stars.

This is one of the best things in our lives and we work hard to keep it going despite all the other calls on our time.  If you can find friends to trust this much I highly recommend it.  It's the best way I know to talk about the things that are on your mind.  It true that sometimes just talking about a problem makes it better, but you also have the life experiences of others to call on and offer advice.  And probably the most important thing is that you have people who can say things to you that most others can't and that can truly show you how others see you.   ",1546301037

They call your parents when you go out and stay out past 1 a.m.?????? What do your parents do or say when your cousins call and tell on you? Is it your parents that are behind all of this in first place? I feel like there‚Äôs part of the story missing.

I was originally planning on at least try to finish it for this year, but it have just been a too big of a project.

So the President is justified in not calling out the Saudi's for killing a dissident because he happened to travel outside the US, and apparently it may damage our relationship if we ask them to please stop assassinating people. What happened to the party of Reagan that you now feel the need to kowtow to brutal dictators for fear of...what exactly? And if Republican leadership isn't based on morality and ethics, what is it based on? Hell even political pragmatism would have led Trump to make your ""what happened was unacceptable"" comment followed by letting the story die, but he didn't. Why not do you think? Is this shameless grifter really so worried about damage to the US, or is he worried about damage to his business dealings in Saudi that will evaporate if he steps out of line?",1546301038

"primatology","t5_2r02d","It‚Äôs best to do bioanth if you don‚Äôt have a specific primatologist track. Seek out opportunities for a study abroad with different universities.

Sometimes a double major bio + bioanth is unrealistic, and most bio minors aren‚Äôt incredibly useful. It will be like bio 101, 102, 201, 202. They‚Äôre good foundationally but not absolutely necessary. 

I cherrypicked more useful courses like genetics, zoology, etc. and only did the reqs for them. It becomes more about getting something out of the courses and less about checking the boxes. At the end of the day, you aren‚Äôt more competitive for grad school if you have elementary bio classes with a minor instead of useful ones.

I studied abroad in Madagascar for lemur ecology research and then interned at the National Chimpanzee sanctuary. Those are the kinds of opportunities you want to look for. Every bioanth program should have at least one. 

Become very sciency and embrace it to become competitive for grad school. Above all else, start thinking about what about it interests you and what you will be able to confidently say you want to spend years researching.

If it helps, try modelling your sens off of another pro's (or someone you look up to) sens. 

It was really weird when I switched to lower sens but I knew I needed it because I was having trouble aiming, so try to be open minded and start by sticking with it and making it a habit first! It'll be fine after the first week or so. You'll also notice that it changes the way you aim as well. At around the sens I play at, there will still be some wrist movement (usually just for tracking and micro adjustments) but it'll mostly be arm aiming.

Feel free to take a look at pros with mouse cams on stream like birdring. He uses like 2.41*800dpi and it's almost all arm aiming but it gets tiring, so make sure you do take breaks every now and then. It's better for your wrists in the long run, though.",1546301041

I'm using static 30 as it just feels more consistent and has none of the bugs that fps++ does.  Kakariko village seems good but one or two spots the fps just tank to an absolute crawl.

"baccarat","t5_2z9lt","**OP , Under 100% perfect counting conditions the answer to the question at the end of the last section is yes. You can theoretically get an edge against the casino playing baccarat.**  That‚Äôs the good news.

The bad news is that the edge is so small and difficult to get that it‚Äôs a complete waste of time.

In The Theory of Blackjack by Peter Griffin, an excellent book for potential card counters, he has a small section about counting baccarat. Through his calculations if you find a baccarat game that deals through almost the entire shoe, count cards and only place bets when you have an edge, and make bets of $1,000 when you have the edge, you‚Äôre long term profit will be roughly 70 cents per hour.

And the biggest problem beyond only making 70 cents per hour based on $1,000 bets is that counting baccarat isn‚Äôt simple. It‚Äôs nothing like counting blackjack.

Many popular blackjack counting systems only require you to add or subtract one at a time. A perfect baccarat counting system requires adding and subtracting large and varied number from the count, and to do it perfectly you actually need to keep at least two separate counts perfectly.

And you only make a bet when the count is in your favor, so according to some mathematicians you only place a bet on one out of every 400 hands or more. Even if the casino let you count cards for hours on end they‚Äôre probably going to tire of you only making a wager every couple hours.

I‚Äôm sorry to disappoint you, but counting baccarat is simply not worth the time or effort. You also have to risk large amounts of money for miniscule returns, which is rarely a good idea.

If you really want to find an alternative to counting blackjack, your best bet is to learn how to count Spanish 21, a derivative of blackjack. It doesn‚Äôt have as much heat as blackjack, but the casinos do watch it some.

But you can get a much higher edge playing it if you know how to count than playing baccarat. Card counting works for blackjack and Spanish 21 if you know how to do it and can get away with it. It can even work for baccarat, but as you can see it isn‚Äôt worth the effort. I highly recommend you use the practice mode in online casino like VegasCasino.io to improve your skill  .",1546301042

"gamedev","t5_2qi0a","Dear B3L7,

I'll give feedback as I think of it!
First off I think marketing wise it would be quite hard to succeed with a regular spaceship shooter game in Android. The ""Eternity Pilot"" title image looks a bit cheap, not sure why. Maybe it's the yellow lines that have varying width? There may be more to it though. The title screen feels polished though, other than that.

Ok, so I ran out of bullets and bombs at the tutorial stage. Quite fast too lol. I think you lose a lot of players at this specific moment. The bomb area of damage feels too small and the enemy that requires bombing is also quite hard to hit.

I think one thing that is really common in indie developers is making the game too hard because they playtest it a lot and balance it towards high difficulties. And sometimes hard in ways that don't necessarily feel good. You may have counterarguments for my points, but I think that in the end of the day you have to make the player feel good about the game and THEN challenge them.

Why not put in some analytics and try to find out at which point most gamers stop playing? Good luck and I hope my feedback helps you!

I personally believe what he said to taylor about this. Crime and drugs will still exist, but overall it's less severe because he's a narcissist and if his city doesn't look good on paper he'll take it as a shortcoming of his rule. Villains will remain strong, but it'll be less blatant

&gt;Does he share the end-of-the-world premonition with the heroes like Taylor did?

Probably not, but he'll exercise his power as the director and with TT possibly becoming his second ""pet"" to see what clues he can piece together. Cauldron eventually brings him into the fold and he learns more

&gt;How does the S9's visit to BB unfold when it's ruled by Coil? 

Bitch and/or Panacea defect to the S9. Panacea has decent odds of dying to Siberian.

I fully believe he would be worthless against Scion. His power is prediction, and even the Simurgh's prediction can't directly see Scion. I'd wager that either

a) it flat out fails to work when Scion plays a major role in what's being predicted, or

b) his predictions work, but as if Scion doesn't exist in them, which causes some weird cognitive dissonance as his predicted future and reality play out together but are different",1546301043

I've experienced the same type of feelings of ""anxiety and terror,"" and sometimes you just have to isolate yourself from everyone and the world, and find yourself on your own. Every situation is different - and sometimes social interaction may be the helping hand rather than isolation...but if the problem is intertwined with social life, then there's a good chance finding yourself on your own and cutting everyone and everything out is a good idea for a little while.

Raiding, as a once per week activity subject to lockouts, was never something I fell behind doing even if I was really busy.  I also miss the Nightfall as a challenging pinnacle activity.  There were some D1 Nightfall combinations that were super punishing, and it was also one of the routes to the best rewards.

"books","t5_2qh4i","&gt; has anyone ever read detective novels and taken notes as if you were working through the clues to solve the case?

I did this specifically with Roger Ackroyd and found several issues/conveniences that I posted to Reddit and other sources seeking opinions but didn't get an answer :/ My gist is that most readers overlook/don't look too in-depth at the actual core details and just accept things. Here is my issues and inconsistencies.

Issue 1: Ursula Bourne was ""in room til 9:55"" as alibi and thus Poirot uses this to deduce she met someone but says the time doesn't fit for meeting the drug addict. Um, no?? Her alibi leaves her free from 9:00 to 9:55 fully at least, during which she could meet with the drug addict. Or/And Ralph Paton too.

Issue 2: The ""From R"" engagement ring could be from Roger to Miss Ferrars and then he threw it away in the water after learning she killed her first husband (we read that she saw the disappointment/change in his face when she told him). Ralph/Ursula throwing away such a valuable ring is ridiculous when they have such money issues, especially Ralph! Using this ring to deduce a secret marriage between the two is ridiculous and not the logical deduction. I think the ring being from Roger would be the simplest solution ala Occam's Razor.

Issue 3: the diagram on page 81 of the book doesnt make it clear that the grandfather chair would block the table. And what if Parker noticed the dictaphone upon entrance? All he had to do was look around the room at a quick glance after the body. In fact, what if someone else was at the door to see Roger and came in too? I feel the narrator/Dr Sheppard's plan is very risky.

Side Issue thats not really an issue (very minor nitpick of mine):More minor but I think this work is a bit dated since I didn't know what a dictaphone is. This one isn't so much an issue but was a minor annoyance.

Issue 4: Its just a theory of a dictaphone used to play back Ackroyd's voice - there's no actual proof. What if Ackroyd was talking into a dictaphone at 9:30? Poirot has no actual proof against the doctor.

Issue 5 (moreso something I dont understand than an issue): So ultimately, Poirot gets the doctor to confess and commit suicide to protect Paton? But why frame Ralph Paton with the shoes in the first place? Unless he wants Ralph to get caught and thus intentionally had him hide to make him seem guilty? But if so, then why not stay silent? Poirot has no actual evidence. Or just run from the country with all the money he's acquired and saved, aside from the bit wasted on speculation? (he says he got an inheritance after the speculation, which was the money he got from Miss Ferrars)

Issue 6: why not just put Ralph Paton into a hotel? There's no specific reason an insane asylum would truly work better, even if the doctor was used to them. Or maybe Paton would want to go into an insane asylum.

Issue 7 (single BIGGEST issue): Flora's lie saying she talked to her uncle at 9:45 to Parker and maintaining it up til learning of the burglary and the murder is ridiculous. First, prior to the murder being revealed/if there were no murder that night, she would be screwed if the money went went missing because Roger may ask who was around the area that night. And if Parker says he saw Flora and that Flora SPOKE to Roger, then Roger would know thats a lie. And Flora knows this too. So the logical lie Flora SHOULD have said was ""I'm here to see my uncle/wish him a good night."" It would explain being at the door but also means she hasnt spoken to her uncle yet (a much safer and more protected lie and equally viable). Now, why was this not the false lie she used? Simple, because Christie cant have those two open the door/attempt to open the door, and she needed an excuse to throw the time of murder off a bit more. But she trips over her own feet/mystery by doing so because the lie is a stupid lie that would be found out at once if Roger werent killed.

Addendum to Issue 7: If Flora took the money from upstairs of the 40 pounds, why was it so strongly implied that Miss Russell took it to give to her drug addict son?

This reminds me of Murder on the Orient Express and ATTWN with their endings which I found similarly ridiculous/unbelievable, and likewise, there's always more than one possible solution given the solution and insufficient evidence to actually narrow it down with pure deductions and truth. The only mystery of hers I've liked so far was Mysterious Affair at Styles because it had the most traditional structure for a mystery. Christie's big three of MOTOE, ATTWN, and TMORA mainly get points for their unique ends but fail as far as successful/fair mysteries IMO.",1546301045

Also, if you don't mind me adding on with a generalized rant: 

Honestly, tracer rounds *across the board* need a penetration nerf. In reality they always do worse against armor than an otherwise-identical slug without the tracer element due to the fact that they end up transferring less energy to the target. The tracer compound burns up in flight, which means the projectile that ends up hitting weighs less, which directly translates to inferior penetration. This is **basic fucking physics**. And that's not getting into how in some cases the tracer loads are lighter *to begin with* than their non-tracer counterparts (e.g 7.62x39 PS versus T45M - T45M weighs about 5% less, 7.6 grams versus 7.9).",1546301045

As nowhere on this ""entire thread and our conversation"" do I see any indication of me blaming the other, I suggest obtaining your information from actual text and not from what some malcontent daubed on a lavatory wall.

&gt; No, I have no clue what feelings you're projecting on me

Since I wasn't projecting any feelings, this is such a waste of a sentence. Look, you were the one who actually wrote that I was being an asshole, and as the word asshole means ""an irritating or contemptible person"" you were essentially writing that I was being irritating or contemptible. Furthermore, as nowhere in my comments on this thread do I see any indication of irritating others or holding others in contempt (otherwise you would have been able to provide the original text), it would mean that the irritation and contempt must come from the writer (you). Thus, you were feeling irritation or contempt and then went on to conveniently project them onto me with that easy-to-type-nonsense.

&gt; citing the dictionary brings your favourite refrain to mind

Citing the dictionary definition is to ensure that there is no confusion about a something when communicating. 

&gt; I mean, sure looks like another statement you said about other people that would have been better made as an ""I"" statement about yourself.

Yes, I backed what I wrote by referring to your own words, which referrencing is further elucidated in this reply (second paragraph above). 

But I guess like the other commentator instead of seeing the facts for what they are you will only coming up with yet another bout of the same old.

She told me that she already had a very low sex drive before we met each other but then I triggered something in her she said. But yeah, it was not for long.

I wouldn‚Äôt need daily sex, I‚Äôd already be happy with 2 times per week. But since 2 years we have 1-2 or 3 times sex per month. She‚Äôs tired very often, I get that. My love is stronger. But the additional thing is that I love to do different stuff in bed, to try out new things, interested in different positions, using sex toys, etc. 

Sometimes I feel really sad and a bit helpless. Fantasies and masturbation is what‚Äôs left for me. I really love her so I wouldn‚Äôt cheat on her. But it feels like I‚Äôm missing something. We talked about that a lot of times. She understands my points and I understand her points. The problem is, the situation doesn‚Äôt change.

So I cannot help you. I just can say that I feel with you. The most important thing is that you can talk about your feelings and desires with him, but that you also listen to what he‚Äôs saying.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; Clinton was Impeached and should have been convicted. The fact that he wasn't, it opens the door for the Senate Republicans to use partisan tactics to leave him in office for their manipulation and benefit.

Oh give it a god damn rest man.  The 106th Senate had 55 Republicans in it and only 50 even voted conviction on the first charge and only 45 on the second.  They literally *all* knew there was never any chance of removing him, they knew the charges were complete bullshit, and they had no interest in legitimately pursuing it.  The ones who voted *for* conviction were politically grandstanding knowing full well there was zero chance the motion would pass.

Our current Trump problem has literally *nothing* to do with the charade that was Clinton's impeachment.  Every single Republican at the time knew it was grandstanding purely for the sake of crippling Democrats' chances in the 2000 election. 

I mean for fuck's sake, do you understand that what the special counsel did with Lewinski was *actually* the definition of a ""perjury trap?"" 

The Whitewater investigation began, and had a mandate limited to, Clinton's real estate dealings. 

Asking him about the affair, under oath, knowing that he would be compelled to lie given that the truth would be used as a political weapon against him, and then having that used against him as perjruy when counsel utterly and totally failed to find *anything* related to their actual mandate *is the fucking definition of a perjury trap*, which is tantamount to prosecutorial misconduct.

At the end of the day, you don't want to handicap yourself with contracts, I get that perspective...but also talented players deserve to get paid, especially if their play determined that they get paid and by the Steelers franchising him they *knew* how great he was and that they needed him because if they didn't they would have let him go.

Last night at the ten minute mark one guy straight destroyed half the base on the side the husks were attacking and kept editing the walls around it into an open archway. He wouldn't respond to voice or chat and kept doing it. Anytime we'd go hunt resources we come back to a half destroyed base and most gas traps destroyed. We managed to make it to 25 minutes in spite of him.




The match I played about 20 minutes ago had a Bloodfinder AC that never once helped. He kept fighting (and dying) to lone krampus' the entire game. Never once added bluglow, built or upgraded a wall or placed a trap. We actually hit the 43 minute mark in spite of him as well.

I won this last month and am releasing it back into the wild. Notes from prev raffle; Crown operates weirdly due to its telescopic design but IT‚ÄôS NOT BROKEN-I promise. Comes with box, no papers-service history unknown. Winds well, chrono pushers are firm and hands reset to 0.

"ufc","t5_2qsev","The DSM-5 favors the term ""Anti-Social Personality Disorder"" over psychopathy/sociopathy.

  


Here are the criteria for diagnosis:

  


- Failure to obey laws and norms by engaging in behavior which results in criminal arrest, or would warrant criminal arrest

  


  


  


  


- Lying, deception, and manipulation, for profit or self-amusement,

  


  


  


  


- Impulsive behavior

  


  


  


  


- Irritability and aggression, manifested as frequently assaults others, or engages in fighting

  


  


  


  


- Blatantly disregards safety of self and others,

  


  


  


  


- A pattern of irresponsibility and

  


  


  


  


- Lack of remorse for actions (American Psychiatric Association, 2013)

  


  


  


Also;

  


&gt; The DSM-5 indicates that Antisocial Personality Disorder is comorbid with substance abuse disorder

https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/antisocial-personality-disorder-dsm--5-301.7-(f60.2)\

  


There's no known cure for this disorder, so everyone who thinks Jon is even capable of ""changing"" are just naive.

  


People with this disorder can adjust their behavior when it benefits them, but the hallmark trait is that they are simply *incapable* of feeling empathy for others, or remorse when they hurt others.

  


Sociopaths love to convince their victims they're sorry and that they've ""changed"" so they can lure them back and abuse them over and over.

There's core principles that are at the root of a belief system that are usually determined by your subscription to a religiously-based entity, or were at least first discovered and spread by a religious body to a larger culture.

I find that the vehemently pro-abortion group is at least partially, if not majority, composed of people who have to rationalize away the fact they chose to murder their child for (most often) selfish reasons, and mentally cannot deal with the shame and emotional trauma that comes along with owning up to that fact. It's not a religious argument, it's pure self preservation. Try and put yourself in the terrible mental state to even want to kill your kid in the first place, and just imagine what admitting you're a murderer after the fact would do on top of that.

Hey everyone. My cat Twizzler is a bit of a dummy and she just chewed through some fiberglass insulation, so we had an emergency vet visit... and unfortunately I'm out of emergency vet funds.

I'd love if anyone could help me out here. I'm willing to provide any information you need, or if you're in NYC I'll even meet in person.

Thank you and Happy New Year!

"grandorder","t5_39d7x","While the real meaning of the word was lost in translation, the Seibah class must not be confused with the Saber class. It is understandable however, with translation atrocities such as Goredolf or Altria. We must however understand that Type Moon cannot English.

While exceptions such as Gilles de Rais exist, all Saber class servants are expected to be related to a sword of legend and/or have the capability of shooting one or more beams with it. Examples of this include: Siegfried, Musashi, and Gawain.

The concept of Seibah is one of exquisite detail and importance. For its origin lies in the one true FSN waifu: Artoria Pendragon. While the regular eye may have trouble fully understanding what it means to be Seibah, we can always count on our local expert Medea on the topic.

[A live demonstration can be seen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA9tZXR9mWA)

Now, for the untrained eye this could be dismissed as a simple trait that Medea has, the obsession over OG Seibah. But we must push ourselves beyond that. We must understand the teaching best housewife makes an effort to present to us.

The most important feature we can grasp from what it means to be a Seibah is the cuteness associated with the concept. Adding to that, the trait ""Hunger"" can be considered a property of that trait. A sub-class of it, if you will.

While Seibah has gained multiple variants over the years, as well as alterations of her original body structure. Her facial features have been mostly preserved intact. Such property is what we call Seibahface (True). 

Back to the topic at hand. The study of what being Seibah truly means, is a field bustling in activity in recent years. Characteristics of it have been discussed, but a general consensus is of limited detail. As it stands now, a Seibah meets the following:

* Almost constant desire for good food.
    * While the Alter variation of Seibah tends to reject the concept. We must understand that the Alter version seeks **modern-day junk food** which remains leagues better to the dishes she tasted in her own time.
* Cuteness to a sweetening degree. Multiple exhibits can be found such as:
    * [Exhibit A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiHsW_VnZic)
    * [Exhibit B](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yF_Mbvu6eTE)
    * [Exhibit C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_U91Zxaayyo)
* Fair facial features that match a considerable size of the population's definition of beauty.

Given the evidence presented we can conclude that Seibah kawaii!",1546301061

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;How is it different from atheists claiming evidence of god does not exist by saying evidence of god is somehow invalid?


Examples please? What demonstrably sound arguments or independently verifiable evidence can YOU cite which effectively supports the claims that god(s) factually exists?


&gt;Then are you saying that negative claims need to be defended?


If that negative claim asserts an affirmative position, then the answer is yes.  


With regard to obligation that falls upon atheists, they need only to specifically explain (In detail when requested) why they have determined that the evidence and/or arguments presented by the opposing side do not actually support the assertions and/or conclusions.

Once again, atheism is a position of non-belief in the existence of god(s). All that is required of atheists is for them to explain in detail why the theistic arguments and supposed evidences are logically fallacious, demonstrably unsound and unsupported by independently verifiable evidence. 



&gt;There is none according to flat earthers. They are not obliged to defend that rejection according to your logic of ""negative claims don't need proof"".


Why do you constantly have to lie by misrepresenting the positions of others? When have I ever once stated during our discussions that ""negative claims don't need proof""? I defy you to back up that complete distortion of my stated positions. 


Go ahead. I dare you. Provide a link to where I ever claimed that. 


&gt;The only way you can change that is to defend your claim of the nonexistence of evidence of god.


I need only show how the claims of evidence and arguments proffered in support of the theological assertions for the existence of god(s) are not objectively independently verifiable, are logically fallacious and/or are not demonstrably sound. 


Please present your very best argument or evidence in support of your claims. 


&gt;I heard the same statement from flat earthers claiming that there is no evidence of round earth. All that the apologists ever put forward amounts to nothing more than a series of evidentially unsupported and demonstrably unsound suppositions/arguments which never effectively backs up their predetermined conclusion of a round earth.


As this is the claim that you are now championing, I must conclude that you personally reject the validity of all modern science regarding the sphericity of the Earth.


Either that or you must be asserting that the independently verifiable scientific evidence for the supposed existence of god(s) is actually far more substantial and definitive than all of the scientific evidence supporting the conclusion that the Earth is spherical. 


So which is it? Are you willing to admit that you effectively reject the validity of all modern science or are you claiming that you can cite huge amounts of independently verifiable evidence that demonstrates that god(s) do exist?",1546301063

Over simplified explanation: Your Thyroid makes T4. T4 is the storage hormone, and it must be converted into T3, the active hormone, to be used by your cells. TSH tells the thyroid to make more T4 (so high TSH is bad, it‚Äôs not meeting demand.)

There are different reasons for this that have names, I‚Äôm in the unexplained category - none of the known reasons/syndromes fit.

Putting restrictions or licenses on *rights* defeats the purpose of it being a right. Who sets the standards? Who enforces the standards?

Take Literacy Tests for voters as an example. In concept its a great idea to have a smart voter base, just like in concept its great to require training courses before people get guns.

However in practice literacy tests were used to prevent minorities from voting, and in practice requiring tests before obtaining guns heavily politicizes the standards of the test and becomes a de facto ban.

If someone's ideas are so retarded, you should be able to destroy their ideas easily and then convince the masses that you are right and they are wrong.

Not allowing bad players to argue their point (and then lose the argument) means they'll never learn, because they aren't engaged in the conversation.

The poster who says ""Hammond is an offtank"" before getting 7 replies saying ""He's actually a maintank because x,y or z"" is going to learn faster than the dude who is not allowed to say ""Hammond is an offtank"".

So it‚Äôs easy to create food, water and shelter? If that were true then why don‚Äôt poor people just make their own bare essentials? If it isn‚Äôt hard to produce these things then I would be forced to assume that people who lack food or clean water are just stupid.

Here is the problem with your beliefs. You somehow believe that bare essentials are so difficult to produce that people are forced to work long hours in order to provide for themselves, yet also believe that bare essentials are so easy to produce that we could give people food, water and shelter for free.

&gt; ""Creating real economic wealth"" = we are exploiting them

Creating economic wealth does mean you are being exploited. Jeff Bezos created more economic wealth in 2018 than I will create in my entire life. I hardly think that you would argue them at he is being exploited.

Also, how is this exploitation? The employee wants money so that they can pay for goods and services. The employer wants people to do work for them so that they can keep their business operating. The employee-employer relationship is completely voluntary and both parties can exit the agreement whenever they like. Therefore, it is not exploitation.

&gt; This is exactly the kind of language I was referring to before

What kind of language? All that was doing was criticizing you beliefs.

&gt; There simply is no reason for me to detour to debunk wildly inaccurate assumptions about basic economic principles

Well at least tell me what assumptions I am making that are inaccurate or make an attempt at a rebuttal. But you won‚Äôt. You have routinely ignored my points and criticisms, and all you have done is say things like ‚Äústop using that kind of language‚Äù and ‚Äúyou are part of the problem‚Äù.

Prague -&gt; Budapest -&gt; Train/bus (you can also Fly but not needed imho) - better to visit brno/vienna/bratislava what is on the way.
Budapest -&gt; Bucharest - Fly or take a night bus.

All cities have good public transport. And you can rent city bikes in most of them. 
The most expensive is Prague, but still cheap - 50-70 USD per day should do it (depends on housing and if you avoid tourist scams, I normally spend there about 40usd per day). So 42x60 -&gt; 2.5k USD for 6 weeks. The cheapest is Bucharest but I have never been there (not much to see). All the trains and buses should be around 200USD. The local fly tickets depends when you book them but still it should be bellow 50 usd per fly if you book it 1 month in advance. The buses/trains you can book couple days before the trip, based on the mood. 

Vienna should be definitely on your list but it is more expensive than Prague (eating out and beer).",1546301066

Suppose lab grown meat hits the market tonight, at the start of the new year, which as I understand it was planned anyways.  Great, it will probably help bring down the price and help end factoring farming.  But now what happens to the animals?  These creatures have been bred for generations by humans, sometimes had their DNA modfied artificially by humans, how much money is being set aside right now for their caretaking and reintroduction to the wild as viable species?  There needs to be a tax on meat, now, which begins investing and paying for this to occur, otherwise the extinction of those species becomes a very real threat where they're not able to become further domesticated, and even the domestication of those species alone is not an acceptable alternative for their reintroduction to the ecosystem.",1546301068

My initial comment was a bit flippant but to be completely serious, you need a thick skin.  Property managers are viewed a bit like police - nobody really likes dealing with them, it's easy to blame them for doing their jobs, but most people grudgingly admit they are necessary.  And, just like the police, after years of dealing with people who are generally rude, demanding, break rules, insult you and are all around unpleasant, the way you treat people will change.    
  
Unlike working in retail or some other customer service jobs, conflicts with tenants or residents can get very intense because it's about their home which is very personal.  Basically, people can get very crazy very quickly.  I've never been assaulted, but I've had lots of stereotypically ""normal"" people (middle class, aged 25-45, educated etc) basically do the equivalent of road rage at me, mostly when I catch them or call them out on doing something bad (taking someone else's parking spot, leaving full garbage bags in the lobby, not cleaning up after their dog,  propping the front door open, taking over an empty storage locker, not flattening their cardboard boxes, opening the roof hatch and going on the roof, taking up the entire laundry room air-drying their clothes, leaving hockey equipment in the stairwell, locking their bike to the guard rail in the fire exit, dumping an old mattress in the driveway...)

Sit at a desk or table of a height that you can comfortably rest your elbow, with the pendulum hanging with enough room to swing freely. Relax, and tell the pendulum to show you ""Yes,"" then ""No,"" and to indicate an uncertain response. Most often, these will present as horizontal and vertical swings, or clockwise and counterclockwise circles. I've had uncertainty present as a figure-eight or cross-shaped swing. Let the pendulum come to a rest between questions. Once you have the vocabulary set, it's just a matter of tinkering around, to figure out how best to use it. 

If you have a reading methodology that makes you comfortable, there's no reason not to use it with your pendulum, as well. ",1546301068

Rent? Is this 'sharing an apartment', or 'owning a home'?

Transport? Is this 'owning a bicycle', or 'owning a car'?

Food? is this 'rice and ramen', or 'shrimp and steak'?

Those are all extremes. at no point are you asking 'between', or 'where between' or anything else.

How about how I lived on min wage?

2 bedroom apartment in a 'cheap' part of orange county, with a roommate who as my friend.

 ate cheap food. rice, beans, chicken.

occasional went to a movie.

Paid for school.

had cheap insurance for my car.

How about we go back to that?

It is also not unlikely to see people to fly out to other DZs over the weekend. For example, I am in northeast.

Anecdote: Years ago, I was running errands around town the day of a concert (I had purchased tickets 2-3 months before).

At one point in the afternoon, saw a panhandler in a very distinctive yellow windbreaker at an off ramp.

That night, while waiting to get in the venue, guess who I saw in line? Yes, redditor, that very same panhandler I saw earlier in the day.

I mentioned the same to him and he'd told me that in about 3 hours of freeway panhandling (2 or 3 different ramps, morning, afternoon and evening rush), he had enough to buy a ticket to the concert (*granted, it was general admission vs my upperdeck/bar seating, but still not cheap*), a decent dinner *and* a room for the night.",1546301071

If charm and symbol prices get too high, the recipes requiring 1 symbol or charm become cheaper, inducing substitution and increasing mote demand (since those recipes require many more motes).  If charms or symbols drop enough in price, the opposite occurs, driving down mote prices.

As for which runes and symbols require 1 vs 3?  No idea.  They could have rolled a die.

Note that while the input/output is sound, prices are driven by inventories as well as flows.  Motes are very common and your bank fills up with them quickly, while symbols and charms are individually valuable and easy to store.  It's not surprising that most of the value is in the rarer materials, as those are much more likely to be hoarded or hidden in player's material storage than the overflowing motes.",1546301071

I think I can say I fully agree here. I do think we keep Grady. I don't see how we can not, unless we feel we can somehow draft someone who is capable of stepping into that role immediately. But I don't see how we can keep Beasley. Cutting him and possibly Alford will save us a ton of money. Though I am on the fence about Alford.

I'm a little painslut, and I'm always thinking of new ways to hurt  myself. This time I decided to get myself off using hot sauce instead of  lube. Watch me mix extreme pain with pleasure as I pour hot sauce on  the tip of me eight inch dildo and then fuck little pussy with it fast  and hard. I cry out from the overwhelming combo of pain and pleasure and  eventually the pain gets to much it makes me cum without even having  the dildo in. I continue to fuck myself, trying- and failing- not to  make too much noise despite the burning heat the dildo pushes deep into  my cunt. I decide to add my vibrator into the mix having a series of  orgasms until the intense pain and pleasure is finally enough for me.

&gt;His comedy was something that we loved because he was incredibly introspective and insightful and seemed like a decent person. We saw him two more times in person, watched every special and episode of his show together. We went to the comedy cellar and took a selfie in front of his signed pic there.

&gt;‚ÄúThe sea levels have risen now and it‚Äôs not much in the history of the world but it‚Äôs enough to tell us that it‚Äôs time to make some changes.‚Äù

**Nerfs to Synergistic Heroes**

* Zarya energy gain reduced
* Lucio speed boost reduction and eventual Lucio rework
* Ana: nano speed boost removed, bionade bonus healing reduced, ult charge reduced (the last one was a direct response to a comp where she mostly used nano on Reinhardt)

I closed out 2018 by releasing (it went live yesterday!) the 17th book of Word Maze puzzles, ""Fabulous Fish Word Maze Puzzles."" The books are fantastic for both adults and kids. The puzzles are similar to word search puzzles, but they are much more engaging, educational, and help improve attention and focus. Most of the books are available both in print (8.5"" x 11"") and in ebook formats.

Fabulous Fish is available on Amazon here: [https://www.amazon.com/Fabulous-Fish-Word-Maze-Puzzles/dp/1792897782/](https://www.amazon.com/Fabulous-Fish-Word-Maze-Puzzles/dp/1792897782/)

More information on Word Maze puzzles and other books available is here: [https://www.wordmazebooks.com/](https://www.wordmazebooks.com/)

My immediate goal for 2019 is to focus on finishing ""The Terrible Story of the Terrible Curse of the Terrible Ham.""

 &lt;! I went to the ER on Thursday for bleeding. I should have been 5+6. Nothing on the ultrasound and HCG levels of 162. Feeling defeated and positive I had miscarried. Couldn't go in to do another beta till today. Now my HCG is at 542. Not quite doubling but still going up at a semi normal rate. I'm so confused and frustrated. My doc ordered another beta to see if it continues to increase and then we may do another US depending on results. I had accepted that I had lost the baby and was just hoping that my levels would decrease to confirm. Now I'm in limbo. Those levels are still way low for being what I would expect to be 6+3. I got a faint positive at what I'm confident was 12 DPO. Even if somehow I ovulate 3 days after my positive opk I would have been 8/9 DPO and the levels would still be outside a healthy pregnancy limit. !&gt; ",1546301077

All of these steps must be put out for public bid, as well.  UDOT is currently prepping for projects that are 7 or 8 years from having the first orange barrel put out on the road.

It's easy to say ""other states have reflectors,"" but there's a lot more involved.  Think about all the variables.  Snowplows vary by the kind of blade and how often they used, and that can inflict different kinds of problems.  Same with the salt used and how often it needs to go down.  What if it's a road where people frequently have chains on their tires?  That causes damage.  Does the road warm and freeze and warm and freeze all winter?  That causes cracking.   Is the local soil made of a clay or a sand that could stick around the reflector?  What kind of materials are introduced to the road via the cars' tires?  How is the drainage along the road?  How is the pollution in the area and how does it affect the road?  Does the road go a long time with no summer rain, so that things get gunked up by dust and grime?  What about road use?  A road with high-speed, frequent traffic will have a whole different sent of issues than a road that is less traveled, but experiences more weather changes.

Changes aren't cheap.  So in the best interest of tax dollars, these things are monitored over several years in several areas to see how well they perform over many seasons in different conditions.

The locations that reflectors have been installed are U.S. 50 west of Salina, U.S. 89 south of S.R. 14, and northbound I-15 about 25 miles south of Cedar City; these are in their second year. UDOT is also studying some new line paint with a different kind of wet reflective beads; this paint was installed last fall on westbound I-215 between 6200 S. and I-15 and will also be studied for 3 to 5 years.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","&gt; They created Elder Scrolls and are more personally invested in it.

meaningless as you could say that about any game/company.

&gt;After the commercial fail that was 76 they need a win.

That doesn't mean they will get one.

&gt;ZeniMax (parent company of Bethesda) is a privately held company and Elder Scrolls is one of their most lucrative IPs. They don't want to kill that so they will give the time needed for ES6 to be both a commercial and critical success. 

There are so many assumptions based on little more than your feelings.

Why not base expectations on trends and facts and not feeling?

Like how their games are gaining more issues and less stability as they make more, or how they have LITERALLY said they are sticking to their shitty outdated engine for TES VI in stead of a new one.

&gt;Bonus: There are plenty of Elder Scrolls fanboys (myself included) that will buy the game at launch based on playing previous titles in the series. 

And there is the problem, with people like you there is no real incentive to make the game good or even functional as long as they have people willing to buy a name rather than a game.

"expats","t5_2rhwp","I get up in small town USA, and my wife is from Hong Kong. I met her when I moved to her city here in HK. 

After several years we moved to Singapore, my second international move and her first. It was a big move for her, but we were seriously dating and wanted to eventually get married. It was very nice to see her grow more independent being away from family and seeing her make new friends. 

We talked about our financial goals before the move and decided to live a budget lifestyle for 3 years in Singapore and saved a fever amount of money. I‚Äôm the bigger earner and she has the discipline. We are an excellent team, we are opposite in so many ways that we ground each other. She‚Äôs very serious and I‚Äôm way too playful. When it comes to money she keeps me in check and when it comes to life and enjoying it a bit I keep her in check.

We definitely have our arguments, being different nationalities is challenging at times, but we have a child and plan to have another. It‚Äôs a lot of fun but also hard work.

Be as open as possible, we try to be, but we aren‚Äôt great at it and little things can become an argument. As an Expat life is already stressful, don‚Äôt let your partner be one of them. 

My wife and I will be moving from HK to London in about 6 months, it‚Äôs a a stressful time, but the move is essentially covered by my company, our biggest worries are where to live when we get there and going from dual to single income. 

It‚Äôs an adventure! Good luck everyone... talk to your partner",1546301084

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","Red pillers are a maladaptive strategy to changing times. I used this analogy in another thread and I think it fits well. 

Through most of history the concept of property has dominated relationships and sex. Women are property, their sex is a product, and backwards men still call the dating world ""the sexual marketplace""

Red Pill, seeing that women do not want to be owned anymore, has adapted by attempting to learn to squat successfully on property they acknowledge they have no control over. This is the red pill version of respecting women's choices. ""I might actually get my life ruined now so I'll play just enough by your rules to not break a law, after that I'll take whatever I can get and give little to nothing back like I think women want to do to me""

They are attempting to define their own subculture which is expressly parasitic, seeking to gain while putting little to nothing in without breaking rules that would end the game, like raping someone. ",1546301087

There are a lot of better words that more accurately describe what you're going for. Regardless, the discussion of sovereignty is not invalidated by your distaste for its use in debate. I suspect you use the word 'meme' as a way of devaluing that angle pre-debate.
In any case let's look at your points. US support for the Iran/ Iraq war. As I said, the US denies involvement to this day. I can no more say conclusively than any one else. That's not in question, however the evidence of involvement is indirect and significant:
The US knowingly supplied dual use chemicals during the war. The Commerce Department also allowed shipment of Anthrax at this time. Donald Rumsfeld also arranged billions in loans to Iraq to make sure they could buy weapons, including cluster bombs.
https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-153210/Rumsfeld-helped-Iraq-chemical-weapons.html

As the war progressed, the uS obtained conclusive evidence that iraq was using these chemical weapons. Ronald Reagan was told directly, and he didn't consider it an issue for concern.
Iraq also hit a US civilian ship with a missile during the war and took zero action against Iraq. that's a special relationship. I think the last time the US let something like that slide was when israel shot the USS Liberty to pieces over the course of an hour and a half, killing 34 and wounding 171 [that was a very special relationship though.]

So as i said, the circumstantial evidence is there, but the US denies it. No change to my position on that.

Now with respect to the war being a fuck up, I can see I'm not going to change your mind on this, not least I suspect because no matter my concept of what a fuck up is, it won't meet yours. What can I say? I consider it one of the all time greatest military errors of the last 100-200 years.

As for cost, it was 2.5 trillion in 2013 by conservative estimates:
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-war-anniversary/iraq-war-costs-u-s-more-than-2-trillion-study-idUSBRE92D0PG20130314


Let's just say for argument though that it was 1 Trillion. For half that amount, I suspect Saddam would still have sucked your dick, a bunch of people would still be alive or still have their legs, and Iraq wouldn't be overrun with 10 types of Jihadis. That's my position on that.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course anything more is speculation, especially if this is how he'd want it to actually happen. Reading a Rolling Stones article ([https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/frank-zappa-hologram-to-play-with-former-mothers-on-bizarre-world-tour-201421/](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/frank-zappa-hologram-to-play-with-former-mothers-on-bizarre-world-tour-201421/)) led me to see that Ronnie James Dio also had a hologram concert(s?), and watching the youtube clips it just doesn't seem right. I think in that case it seems like it's a CGI version of RJD and not actual footage. So it just seems forced and weird. The band seems bored, and the crowd seems even more bored. I never got to see RJD either, but I don't think the hologram RJD is doing him any justice. Just weird all around.

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe in the end, the concept of a Hologram is odd. The video REALLY worked at the ZPZ concert. Maybe because we're already used to video as a format. But crappy holograms not yet.

b. I'm serious.  How many missed WRs is more than ""how much you like?""  Since you are not saying ""none"" then I know you realize that all quarterbacks miss open receivers.

I saw Cam Newton miss about a half dozen passes to wide open WRs in his last game.  Rivers missed more than that yesterday. By my count, about four of Dak's incompletions yesterday were ""wide open,"" and he missed precisely \*two\* open receivers last week against the Bucs. Big Ben missed that number of open WRs in the first quarter alone yesterday.

If you think it's so easy for others to ""know what you mean,"" then it should be pretty easy to explain, no?  What is your criteria for an acceptable number of missed, wide open WRs in a game?

This is a number crunch exercise to show a person how soon they can retire on their current track and how to make that work better through Primerica term life insurance and investments.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't do drugs, it illegal and not healthy.

&amp;#x200B;

I  hope you won't use drugs, but if you do, notice the following warnings, as ignoring them can kill you:

1. Daytime festivals are warmer, sometimes also HOT, so don't forget to drink! Super duper important.  
Some drugs will make you less hungry. Force yourself to drink lemonade or Alkaline drink. Don't spare the money, spare your life.
2. Do not mix drugs with other drugs or alcohol/caffeine. Some very popular rave drugs make your heart rate going turbo and blood pressure will be high. Adding caffeine or other drugs to the mix can be lethal. Google for safe drug combination matrix. Stick to it.
3. Buy test kits. Its legal to buy them. If your test brings unexpected results, throw what you have bought. Don't use it. You might kill yourself.
4. Be aware of your friends in the group. If someone don't feel good, seek out medical help. No questions will be asked there. As result of patient confidentiality, its a safe place. I have even seen policemen helping ravers with some familiar symptoms without asking any questions. 

Safe raving! ",1546301094

"lightingdesign","t5_2rfak","OK, so like I said in a different post, my roots are in old-school (mid-90's) rave production.  Back in those days, events were set up as more of a 360-degree experience.  The DJ booth was usually not highlighted all that much, and sometimes it wasn't even really clear where it was.  The result is that people would be facing all directions, which resulted in all sorts of delightful interactions among partygoers, dance circles, etc.  

In contrast, most of today's EDM events have people standing in the same direction facing a stage.  Call me a crazy old fogey, but that drives me bananas.  It's not a concert, and I think the idea of watching someone twiddle knobs from a distance is boring.

My philosophy is still that it should be a 360-degree experience.  My go-to setup is to encircle the entire perimeter of the dancefloor area with scanners pointing inward, plus hang some strobes pointing downward throughout the dancefloor.  Maybe a disco ball in the center that the scanners can be aimed at periodically.  Maybe have a laser and/or lighted backdrop and/or visual projections behind the DJ, but nothing so elaborate that it makes the entire crowd face in one direction.

Anyway, that's my old-man rant about how EDM events shouldn't be treated like concerts.  Thanks for listening.

"internetparents","t5_31jj6","Fellow ginger here (but I‚Äôve got 10 years on you)! First off, idk why you hate your hair, but there are lots of things you can change about your appearance if you want. I‚Äôm pale af and sometimes I like to go tanning. You can die your hair too. I HATED my hair and skin and freckles until I was about 18-19. High school somehow made it worse, when in reality there are a lot of people who are super into redheads. I started getting more compliments once I embraced it and naturally began acting and moving more comfortably. That only really comes with time.

Secondly, please don‚Äôt be stressed about how ‚Äúfar behind‚Äù you think you are in terms of sexual activity. Consider for a moment how many ppl you know who are in relationships, but who haven‚Äôt thought for a moment why they‚Äôre doing it. Like you, so many of these ppl just don‚Äôt want to be alone. Seeing all the happy glowing ig posts and shit is extremely discouraging, but this doesn‚Äôt mean that any of those folks are better off than you. It takes maturity and respect to have a happy friendship or romantic relationship, and boatloads of ppl your age have no skills in these departments and latch onto the first person who fucks them.

The only real advice I can say and truly mean is this: work on yourself and love yourself. There‚Äôs nothing more attractive than a man who knows what interests him, seeks opportunity, is open to new ideas and feels enough self confidence to share some of this with others. It‚Äôs true what they say: it‚Äôs impossible to love others if you don‚Äôt love yourself. If you can find ways to work on your confidence and become more engaged with the community around you, I guarantee others will notice. You don‚Äôt need to go running out like some extroverted valedictorian cheerleader, but showing the world that there are interesting things about you will almost always come with new friends or significant others. So yeah, all I‚Äôve got for you is patience and self-love.

I myself don't feel asexual at all. My transitional phase is more like a bisexual equilibrium; the ultimate bisexuality. At that moment i am very attracted to both genders. Had that a few days ago. Fantasies were among the lines of dating couples n such. Now i transitioned a bit to the gay'er side. My whole cycle takes about a month probably. 1.5 week women, 1.5 week equilibrium, 1.5 week men.

This is probably the quote that gave me that impression: Once we had our starting point, we began taking stock of what we had in the source code and what we could make available, which included restoring the original development database from archival backups. After stitching various key pieces together, we had a locally rebuilt version of Patch 1.12 running internally.

But, source as requested, in the same article you gave:  

So we asked ourselves, would it still be possible to deliver an authentic classic experience if we took our modern code, with all its back-end improvements and changes, and used it to process the Patch 1.12 game data? While that might seem counterintuitive, this would inherently include classic systems like skill ranks, old quests and terrain, talents, and so on, **while later features like Transmog and Achievements would effectively not exist because they were entirely absent from the data.**  ",1546301096

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I see your point. Why wouldn't one be for the continued life of every single one of its fellow humans since we know how precious life is?
I would ask this though. Is it a moral choice if we are only for the life of unborn babies? If we deem human life to be the ultimate concern shouldn't that include all human life? It should include the lives of murderers, foreign enemies, and starving people in other countries. For surely a life of a being fully conscious and aware is just as important as that of potential conciousness. 

Of course this blanket assumption raises many concerns. Can a person forfeit their life by their actions? In the case of violence do I have the right to take a life to protect mine or another's? Is a person whose belief structure is endangering my peace just as deserving of life as I am?  Does evil exist? Can people be evil? These questions are difficult and are wrestled with by philosophers, theologians, and lawmakers alike. Religion is an ancient and current way of explaining a world that is full of these gray areas. It is the birthplace (whether you believe or not) of morality. It was the way in which or ancestors grappled not only with questions of nature, but also questions of morality. 

While you may not be a believer, religion (like it or not) absolutely colors your belief in this area. The demonization, at least in the US, comes from the mixing of religion and politics. Religion is used to justify the moral and logical gymnastics that ""Pro-Lifers"" must employ to gain political influence in a secular arena whilst holding on to a vast array of logically competing beliefs. 

For example, a person who believes that all life is precious and begins at conception irrelevant of that conception being violent yet also vehemently defends the death penalty for criminals is displaying an incongruent thought process. A person who is ""Pro-Life"" yet espouses the view that they will murder law enforcement personnel that come to confiscate their firearms is living on a logical trampoline. A ""pro-life"" person who murders a doctor may actually be out of their minds. There are many more examples, but I believe this is where the vilification comes from. 

Simply put...Life is all gray area. If you pretend it is not, the more enlightened of your fellow humans may discount your beliefs. If you push those beliefs with violence and hate then you will be demonized.",1546301097

   Build up some comment karma by commenting on posts, and post some cute cats on other subreddits to raise your link karma. 
   
   Do NOT use subreddits that offer free karma, because you will be banned automatically from /r/dankmemes.
   
   The reason we do not specify the exact amount, is that specifying that would render this useless as spammers

I agree that we seem to be largely in agreement on the direction the DNC needs to move, even if we are in disagreement about the individual candidates.

The DNC *has* shown that they're cognizant of that in the announced scheduling of their debates, at least.

The best case scenario, as I see it: somewhere between pre-Iowa and South Carolina, the field is narrowed to three (or four) candidates that are largely the same on message and fighting mostly on personality/experience, which drags out to a few weeks before the convention.

"StLouis","t5_2qpnm","The XFL has a chance as long as they stick to what they have been saying all along as to being a real league and not the one with gimmicks like back in 2001.  McMahon has said there will be no gimmicks and nothing from the WWE will be in the XFL.  I have been following what the XFL has been doing since they announced they were coming back.  I recommend people to watch the ESPN 30 for 30 about the XFL, their youtube channel, and listen to the interview that Oliver Luck did with 101 ESPN.  It appears that McMahon has learned from his mistakes and that is why he has hired people with NFL experience and know what they're doing.

&amp;#x200B;

[http://www.espn.com/watch?id=3438ef4e-c82f-4d77-bb89-8a3d598241e1&amp;om-navmethod=espn:search](http://www.espn.com/watch?id=3438ef4e-c82f-4d77-bb89-8a3d598241e1&amp;om-navmethod=espn:search)

&amp;#x200B;

Here are some reasons why I think they have a chance:

&amp;#x200B;

\- The large cash input from McMahon.  The WWE has grown a lot since 2001 so he has more money to use for a better product.

\- Filling a slot where there will be no football.  People love football.  The XFL can fill in on months where there is no AAF or NFL.

\- Learning from past mistakes.  The words and actions taken by McMahon has shown he has so far.

\- Having cheaper tickets.  There are plenty of fans who cannot afford the price to take their family to NFL games as tickets can be pretty expensive.  The XFL will surely be cheaper to attend.

\- Faster game play.  They have said that the XFL is going to look the same on the field to the NFL except for minor tweaks they think will pick up the pace of action, have shorter games, and simplified rules for less flags.  Many fans complain about the amount of commercial breaks and how many flags are thrown during games.

\- The fact that there are a lot of people who have gotten tired of the NFL and how they handle things.  Whether it was spygate, the concussions, Goodell, allowing convicted felons back into the league, the handling of domestic violence cases, corrupt owners who don't follow their own relocation guidelines, players kneeling, etc.  Many people have tuned out.

&amp;#x200B;

All I'm saying is that they have a chance.  We shall see in the coming years how much football this country wants since there will be the XFL, AAF, and Freedom Football League coming in the next couple of years and playing their seasons in the NFL off season months.",1546301101

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","On the note of house down payments, I like to say this to everyone, but you don't have to pay 20% down.  The idea of PMI scares people, but if you are planning on staying in one place for a while, the cost savings of owning vs renting outweigh the cost of PMI if your credit is good.  It's better to wait for a low interest rate on a mortgage than save 20% in a lot of cases.  Paying extra for a few years until PMI is gone doesn't take that much.  If I had bought my house a year earlier, I could have saved .75% apr on the loan, which would have lowered my payment more than my pmi is, and in the long run saved me much more.

It all depends on your area, but in mine renting a house costs ~$800 a month for a house worth $50k.  Buying a $100k house on 10% down is more cost effective, including all taxes, insurance, and closing costs.

In high COL cities where average house prices are high the math gets different, but for many, no you don't need 20%, and it's not always better to wait.",1546301102

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","We could certainly up the difficulty and win a bit less often.  

That is irrelevant. What I'm saying is that both sides snowball towards victory.  

Every invader you kill permanently weakens the invaders. That is less damage and less building they will do for the rest of the game.  
Most setbacks you have (like failing to kill some key invaders, or having to discard a card to the blighted island effect, etc etc) permanently strengthens the invaders, or weakens the spirits.  

Regardless of how well balanced the game is, it is a double snowball, and therefore the difference between each teams progress will amplify more and more each turn.  

A bit of luck can of course turn it around (either for or against you), but that luck would changed the game you even if you were more/less ahead/behind than you were.

-----

&gt;In particular, if you never flipped the blight card, you can definitely handle at least one level harder.

Well, maybe. At the same difficulty level, with a bit of luck, you might lose horribly without ever getting close, or win while (just barely) keeping the island unblighted.

My puppies eat only out of Kong‚Äôs or getting their food for training treats, and it makes life so much easier. Right now my little guy is at my feet gnawing on some yummy frozen pumpkin in the bone-shaped kong. 

OP One thing I have found is you have to train most pups to unstuff a kong completely. I use dry kibble and tiny pieces of FD liver first, so they get the idea of getting the food out, and once they can unstuff it in a minute or two I start packing it harder and harder, progressing to completely frozen solid food, layered, with a hard treat blocking the large opening. If you stuff them too hard at first the pups get frustrated and never learn to really work to get the food out. I learned that the hard way with my demo dog when she was a pup - she doesn‚Äôt give a fart about Kong‚Äôs and it sucks. ",1546301103

I became an atheist at 14 and I know what I would have done. Your relation with your mother is most likely substantially different from mine, so carefully consider if you want to follow this.

Pay attention to the pastor/preacher/whatever and pick 1 thing every week that's untrue/immoral or just plain weird. Think about it (maybe get some help here) and bring it up over Sunday diner. What works best is humor IMO. Laughing about the preacher's nonsense is better than rationally showing your mother why something is wrong. When what you believe is an object of fun to others, you feel that to the core. Few people can stand that for long.

Good luck to you, and like I said, think about this carefully.",1546301107

The night sky, especially during the winter, is full of objects that emit colours that are not visible to our weak eyes. During summer months in the northern hemisphere the bright ""galactic core"" is above the horizon and is very photogenic. Come late fall at higher latitudes that part of the milky way never gets above the horizon and different parts instead are revealed. Often the appearance of the Orion constellation is a sign that the ""summer milky way season"" is over and it's time for ""winter milky way"". The winter milky way is full of deep sky objects that are often rich in ""h-alpha reds"" which is past the visible spectrum. Even if we could biologically see colour at night (our eyes are VERY limited here to start with with. Our colour deprived rod cells are more active at night to help us see anything at all. The tradeoff is that we cannot see colours the same way a camera can), the night sky would not look this way. It takes a camera to see these colours. This in NO WAY diminished the experience you will have if you get away from city lights and look up at the stars. There is no experience like it.

There are many interesting objects in the sky of this image. See if you can spot the Wirtanen comet, Andromeda galaxy, Pleiades star cluster and California nebula, Heart and Soul nebula, Orion Nebula and surrounding nebulae, North American nebula, and many more!

The foreground is 6 vertical panels stitched together with the tracker off. Each panel was exposed 3 times at different focus points and focus stacked in Photoshop. 30 seconds, f2.8, ISO1600. The sky was another 18 panels with the tracker on and then stitched together. 3 minutes, f3.3, ISO800. I then blended both stitched panoramas together. Initially this was 4:5 tall but I warped and scaled it down to 1:1 because the tall panoramas look a bit goofy to me.

Shot with a Nikon D800e, Tamron 15-30 2.8 @15mm, and a Star Adventurer star tracker.

That's the bunch of videos I throw at people I know who are brand new want to learn stuff fast. 

In general there's a lot of mechanical and conceptual things to learn. Focus on a few heroes to get their mechanics down (push your buttons good) and then think about the hero conceptually (how do they want to play the map, what's their early/mid/late game look like, etc.) After that you learn about the other heroes by playing against them using the heroes you are comfortable with and how you need to change your playstyle to be successful. When you find a gap in your hero pool you then learn another hero to fill that gap and repeat the process.

A file or something solid to use as a sanding block.  You want to make sure you get all of the flash out of the drill holes inside and out and crevasses in the frame where the parts like the locking block and the slide stop spring rest. Go easy since the plastic is hard but rough sandpaper or something sharp will cut it like butter. It is ok to use a hand drill on the holes but make sure it is on a solid surface and don't let the drill walk the bit into the jig and don't ream out the holes just get the bit through and then back and forth a few times. Also leave it in the jig when you are working on it and try not to hammer the trigger pin through the slide lock lever, get it in an lined up and push it with something by hand if possible.   The hole is easily damaged and the pin can walk out when firing if it doesn't engage properly. The pins may seem to not want to line up at first but make sure the frame is clear of debris and push the rail sets in while taping the pins in.",1546301110

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","You confused the hell out of me and I'm trans. But I'll try to define the terms as best I can. Transsexual is an older term that's mostly fallen out of use now. It refers to someone who has or is medically transistioning from one sex to the other. Transgender is an umbrella term that's used to describe anyone who identifies with a gender other than the one they were assigned at birth. All transsexuals are transgender but not all transgender people are transsexuals.

There's a common belief among some people that ""gender is a social construct"". Gender roles are social constructs but gender identity itself isn't. That's why you can see feminine men and masculine women who don't follow societal norms but who have no issues with being men or being women. It's why in the case of David Reimer (look him up) you can do horrific psychological damage by trying to force a gender change on a child.  

Gender is neurological and has to do with how the brain is wired. There are biological differences between male and female brains beyond just size. For the vast majority of people their gender and sex align. It's not that way for trans people. Their are studies that support this. Such as brain scans showing trans people's brain's more closely resembling their preferred sex/gender.",1546301112

So I‚Äôm amazed that all fell apart with one movie. 

I agree the quality doesn‚Äôt meet the fandom, but in the opposite of the way I think you‚Äôre suggesting.  Before ‚ÄúSolo,‚Äù critical reception (rotten tomatoes and meta critic) of TFA, Rogue One, and TLJ all indicate that the new movies are extremely high quality. The audience scores for TFA and Rogue One match the critic scores, but are inverted on TLJ, suggesting that TLJ was a well-made movie where something really didn‚Äôt sit right with average viewers. TLJ reception showed us that the fandom is not high quality at all‚Äîit‚Äôs toxic.

To pronounce the next game  based off a throw away note.. that's far fetched, is all.

There was a ritual for Zelda's powers too, Revali seemed to see it as a silly gesture. They probably did the same thing for Link, only his worked (part of why Zelda harbored ill feelings toward Link in the beginning). They never hint at a mystery in game, and I wouldn't put so much weight into a one-line comment in the notes.

I also realized that my mother‚Äôs incessant chatter is a control tactic. It‚Äôs rude to interrupt, so if she keeps talking, you don‚Äôt get to say anything. If you can‚Äôt say anything, then you can‚Äôt say goodbye, and it‚Äôs rude to leave without saying goodbye. It‚Äôs rude to walk away when someone‚Äôs talking to you. 

These people weaponize politeness. They ingrain it when you‚Äôre so young that it‚Äôs not even a rule; it‚Äôs a Law of Physics.

But it‚Äôs not. You can turn and walk away. You can talk right over them (like she always does to your FH, I guaran-damn-TEE she does). You can hop right in your car and drive home flicking them off while blaring ‚ÄúFreebird‚Äù on your stereo.

Now, if your FiL is anything like my father, this ‚Äúrudeness‚Äù might result in threats of violence. So ask your FH if there‚Äôs anything behind that. My father is a retiree. He likes fishing and sitting around the house. Me, I have Martial Arts training (admittedly haven‚Äôt been to a class in over a decade, but I remember). I LIKE fighting. I LIKE the adrenaline rush. When I was a kid, my father was Superman, and he never did really let that image fade. The day I realized I could send him to the hospital was a revelation. It wouldn‚Äôt even be a fight.",1546301117

[All Units here, and the stats of ones I found relevant.](https://imgur.com/a/dil40IG). I say I'm stuck trying to beat Wyvern 7, but I can't even auto 6 because Sez has only 2.2K Atk and cant drain the shield. I run into a similar problem in Golem auto where I can only Auto 6 90% of the time without inspection, and 7 about 80% of the time if I bother to switch targets to the crystal. As a result, I can't seem to get good gear at a rate that lets me actually get strong enough to even... get good gear. lol.

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","Personally I see no objective difference between two machines paying eachother for services vs humans. Both are economic agents exchanging value. The distinction between machines and humans in this case is arbitrary really. It's like saying btc is for the daily payments, iota for machine data, and potcoin coin is for pot, you know? It's all just digital value transfer. 

In the end it's all about the convenience wrapper that faces the public and the greater ecosystem the payment system exists in. Nothing will end up being used as it looks right now, copy pasting long ugly strings of numbers and letters etc. 

Whatever is faster and easier (in context) will end up being used. Btc/eth/nano/iota etc all basically function the same at the base layer of payments. I forsee a future where there are multiple winners depending on context. Lots of positives for many projects. ",1546301119

It's the reality of business and that's standard practice for most large game companies. Old products don't make as much money and there isn't much to be gained by spending the time and manpower that can be of better use elsewhere. So the focus is always bigger on the newer products, especially recent titles that use the live service model. As much as I'd love a few more patches for Unity or the option to start a new playthrough for Syndicate, I don't see either Montreal or Quebec going back to those games, especially since both studios have already released a newer titles in the franchise (Origins and Odyssey respectively).

The decision not to have multiple save slots was obviously a deliberate one, even Rogue (that came on the same day as Unity) has that option, while Unity and Syndicate don't. As for what the real reason is, who knows. Is it because of the way they did microtransactions? The version of the engine they used? Or something completely different? Until Ubisoft gives us an answer, we can't be sure. Origins has multiple save slots and Odyssey has a save system as well, albeit slightly different. So it's not like Ubi has completely abandoned the idea, people obviously love having multiple save slots, but Unity and Syndicate will remain the outliers in that regard.",1546301124

I‚Äôm telling you that the number of immigrants that are criminals is the same percentage of criminals that are natives. I‚Äôm not telling you ‚Äúcrime is not crime‚Äù. Are you thick? I‚Äôm simply saying that you can‚Äôt paint all immigrants with the same brush and kick them out with this hypocritical argument. If you want immigrants out of the country because some of them commit crime, then you should be kicking everyone out for the same reason. 

&gt; Maybe you should check your studies out and see who funds them. Actual studies, from non-biased sources, have shown massive crime increases from illegal aliens. Which is what your Syrian problem is. Just because your politicians invited them in en masse, doesn't change their makeup.

Wrong wrong wrong. Actual unbiased sources and doctors of criminology have said repeatedly that there is no increase in crime. In fact, we have less crime every year. Your ‚Äúunbiased‚Äù sources are biased as fuck dude. Be objective for once. When you‚Äôve got the entire community of experts disagreeing with your view, your view is wrong. 

And who funds the BBC? That‚Äôs fucking hilarious.  My taxes of course. Maybe you should check out who funded both the Trump campaign and the Brexit campaign. Answer: Russia. 

&gt; At this point, you either believe yourself to be a ""clever"" shill, despite posting what has already been proven to be blatant lies, or you're so completely deluded you actually believe what you read. Sad. A pity to waste such a mind as yours.

Who‚Äôs more likely right in this situation? 

A) me, who uses unbiased news sources and experts to come to my conclusions. 

Or

B) You, who uses biased sources and hides in this little echo chamber? 

You‚Äôll find that the answer is, and will always be, A. 

&gt; I'm done, you're not even worth the time to type this.

Such a pity. You may have actually learned something by talking with me, but instead you choose ignorance again. It‚Äôs ok. Not many people are brave enough to have a change of heart. The average person would rather double down on the bad option instead of admit their mistake. It‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many Trump supporters even after his presidency has been a complete shit show. 

The right path is there for you to take. You just have to open your eyes. ",1546301125

"CCW","t5_2s4mc","&gt; While there are motivated people who will fight through spray (soldiers, cops, enraged tweakers), they aren‚Äôt common, and most of those will be less efficient after a face full.

THIS is the biggest thing.  I've been sprayed. (For training. USMC) It definitely sucks, but you can absolutely still fight.  In fact, for the MCMAP course, or security guard or non-lethal weapons instructor of a bunch of other courses, that EXACTLY what they make you do.  They spray you and then make you fight off some sort of attacker.  

I've seen the guys who've been through it a bunch of times appear to damn near shake it off.  It didn't hurt them any LESS, they just didn't react or panic about it, because whatever, they've been through it before.  

&amp;nbsp;

I guess that's my main point.  People seem to have this belief that a person gets pepper sprayed and bam they're physically incapacitated and the fight is right out of them.  Neither of those is true.  Whether they've been sprayed before has a pretty big impact on their reaction.  (As someone else posted, if the dudes done some prison time, decent chance he's been sprayed before.)

&amp;nbsp;

This isn't me saying pepper spray is ""bad"" or ""useless"".  Its not.  Its a great tool.  Just saying, people shouldn't have that false sense of security that its some magic wand and they'll just be standing there triumphant over their helpless bawling baby of a wold be attacker.  

&amp;nbsp;

Interesting side note comes to mind.  You could relate this to a broken nose even.  People are all ""my self defense instructor taught me how to break a guys nose.  He'll drop after that.""  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Getting your nose broken sucks, but a whole lot of boxers and hockey players would tell you, the second or third time it happens, you're hurt and pissed off but you aren't all that phased.

Kid, you barely contribute to life at this stage.  You don't pay bills, you find cook, clean our have a job to pay the mortgage or rent.  It's ok.  You're too young.  The ONLY things you need to do well at are school and being a good citizen.  

Do you contribute ANYTHING?  At home?  Do you say, cook breakfast?  Do the dishes?  On your own?  Or does someone have to ask?  Do you help others?  The elderly?  Do you call your grandparents?  Do you spend time with them?  Do you volunteer anywhere to help someone regularly?

Try this on your dad...ask an open ended question like ""dad? tell me about growing up as a teen"".  Or some shit like that.  Start the question with ""TELL ME"".  Be curious about him.  No one enjoys anything more than being asked to talk about themselves.  Stay interested in his life.  He may like that.  Maybe not.

But more than that, TRY to be someone he can be proud of.  Kick ass in life.  That's all we want our kids to do.  Do at least one thing GREAT.  ONE THING.  Dad, could come around if you do.  If not, hey you got good at something.  Who cares what people think at that point.  You're kicking ass.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I don't have excess skin myself, but from one guy who has body image issues to another, this is my honest advice. As hard as it is, you can't go into every potential new interaction with a partner thinking their immediately going to run for the hills when they see the part of yourself that **you're** self conscious about.

I know this is dangerously getting into the, *""be confident in yourself and people will see that confidence""* advice, and itmight not sound helpful - but it's somewhat applicable here I think. Personally, I've had relationships or short sexual experiences with people that had ""surprising"" body characteristics that were not typical. However, none of those things were the deal breaker. If they were a good person, confident and I was attracted to them, that was enough for me to pursue the relationship. If they didn't have those qualities, then that's why it ended quickly. I think it was because I got to know them and saw them for who they really were, not what they were insecure about.  

Don't get me wrong, you're 100% going to run into people that won't be able to see past it and might end things right away - but that is not a reason to give up and get down on yourself. Yes, it's hard in the moment - but to me that's saving you potential issues in the long run with that person. Life is unpredictable and a relationship over time will be tested. One thing someone might love about their partner...could change in an instant, or maybe over years, or disappear entirely. When I'm looking for someone I try and figure out if this is someone that will roll with those changes. More often then not someone that might say ""hard no"" to your loose skin off the bat, is a good indicator that they're not that person that would be able to stick through those challenges. I have seen friends be dumped or have done the dumping to boyfriends or girlfriends because of weight gain, mental health or other things that cause a change. You want someone that is willing to stick by you as you **positively** work through whatever it is and love you for it. 

If you keep yourself on the sidelines, you might never meet your girl. She could be the next one you talk to, the 4th, or the 10th - but she is out there. Start looking at what makes you an awesome partner, what positive qualities you have and focus/show that. You'll be surprised at what kind of response you get back. :) 

I would suggest checking out John David Glaude and you might have stumbled across him already if you've been researching online. He has an incredibly positive outlook on this area and here's [his interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydIdmOWHc2I) on the Ellen Show.

If the bigger logs don't catch, because the fire isn't properly laid or the logs are damp, the kindling will burn away and the fire will die. NRE will keep you together for a year or so while you establish a deeper relationship, a more lasting love that will burn for many years.

It's called the Black Swan Theory: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_swan\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)  


Just because you've never witnessed a black swan and only white swans (your particular study), does not negate the existence of the Black Swan (my studies and news presented in the video provided above).  You are not dealing with the facts and data provided and are only masking the entire issue with your one study (based upon the Nocebo effect - which, like the Placebo effect, is a measurable, quantifiable effect).  How about a case study of people (like the Firefighters) who were confused and had memory loss that happened at the same time a new 5G tower was put up?  Nocebo?  Did they really feel this way?  Can you say they didn't?  Are you negating their actual accounts and data?  Who are you to say they didn't feel this way, nocebo or not?  


Science is difficult.  You're consensus version of science, is not science - period.  Science is evolving, ever-growing in a direction of truth.  It is never done.    


 

&gt;‚ÄúI want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.  
Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.  
There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.‚Äù

Keto is easy to get back on track with, especially compared to other diets where you've got to deal with hunger / unsatisfying food / blood sugar issues.

Not necessarily. We know it's a special kind of Lead Bullet that can be used as a specialized option trigger, so it would make sense if it were lighter as a drawback. The only reason I'm not saying that is that Ashihara explicitly listed the drawbacks in the last Q&amp;A, and it being lighter wasn't one of them.

It is true we've only gotten weight numbers for Miwa's Lead Bullet specifically, but it's only been mentioned twice. One was a fan question specifically about Miwa, and the second was the BBF more or less repeating that fact. It's not mentioned in the BBF section on Lead Bullet, but then, Ashihara just wrote a long Q&amp;A answer about what makes Miwa's Lead Bullet special without saying anything about the weight.

Don't get me wrong, I agree it's plausible, but I'm not sure we should repeat it as fact, or assume that the difference is large or small.",1546301130

Something you'd apply to USADA for in advance and then be granted/denied..it's been a while, but as I remember, testers arrived for a random and discovered he had (or was maybe in the process off, not sure) been using IV that had been disallowed. I believe it was only a rehydration IV, but they are against the rules for a reason, and an unfair advantage at the very least. 

Anyhow, this was discovered, so he then put in for a waiver which was then retroactively approved. Shady at least. Indicative of his clout/control, definitely seems to be. Beyond that, if for no other reason than because he didn't apply in advance I would think USADA would rarely if ever grant something of this nature done in the order and at the time that it was done. 

Some may consider it a minor violation, others may say it's nothing at all. I view it as an extremely arrogant move that (imo) also shows  an ""above the law""  type attitude as well as willfuly violating the rules, not too dissimilar from other USADA violations.

https://www.drugs.com/uk/dermestril-septem-50-micrograms-24-hours-leaflet.html

Here's the relevant section:

How often you should change the patch
There is enough hormone in each patch to last for several days. In order to ensure a steady supply of
hormone, the patch must be changed at one-week intervals; thus each used patch has to be removed
after seven days and replaced by a new one. The patch may be applied at any time of the day.

The rework was probably a step in the right direction towards making her a more balanced and viable god in Smite, but I think she's a little too ""viable"" at the moment. 

If I were to nerf her, I would probably lower the damage on the 1 to reduce her clear time and the damage of her slowing ability.

If I weren't to mess with her clear I would look towards her ult, it's just so good for damage and safety. I feel like reducing either her movement speed in her ult similar to Chiron or Raijin (although not that significant) or reducing her damage might be a good change.

But I feel like any of those changes might just push her out of viability which I don't want.

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","Well, it is a bummer. I bought GoL at launch anyways as a huge fan of Tomb Raider but I dont mind if it's been on GWG twice now. Look at it this way though, Microsoft advertise GWG as ""get up to $700 worth of FREE games a year!"" So perhaps two cheaper titles is not a bad thing especially early on and assume they have plans to also put two megaton games up on GWG in the next months ahead to make up for the two cheap games, I mean they have to pad it to reach try and reach that goal. Assume they give out cheap games all throughout the year or the games they give out don't quite reach that goal? And it doesn't meet that $700 expectation? You can complain to them then and see where that goes. I personally feel like patience may pay off this year for GWG.

 Maybe we'll get Assassins Creed: Origins since they always seem to be on GWG and Unity was recently on their right? I speculate Shadow of War, Arkham Knight or The Original 2-game collection, Steep, Destiny 2, maybe even Bioshock: Collection I mean just look at the sales going on right now; it's most likely those games will hit the GWG list as that's what's typical of the program. I've bought nearly everything on sale and if those games that were on sale become free, I'm surely not going to complain although it'd be quite disappointing. 

 All in all, I hope GWG steps it up this year. But free is free. And besides that Celeste is part of this Month too and makes up for a game that's been given out twice now. Game has garnered a reputation for being a fantastic platformer and has won many awards. I'm surprised that made it to GWG despite not even being that old.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","There are some excellent recommendations on this thread. I think the book I would put at the top of a list like this is Le Guin's ... The Left Hand of Darkness. It was the first novel ever to win both the Hugo and Nebula awards. 

Written in 1968 (published in 1969) it was strongly influenced by the the ongoing equal rights battles. In one way it is gender role exploration with a sledgehammer. A male ambassador visits a planet where the people are gender neutral most of the time but can become either make or female once a month. You can understand why that is NOT subtle. But in another way it is exceptionally subtle and brilliant.

*Very minor spoiler on general plot direction.*

The ambassador is forced on an arduous journey with an individual who has a male persona when you first meet them. During the journey they switch genders because they are in the company of a male. Because the p.o.v. is solely the ambassador, when you reach the end of the book,you realize that Le Guin has tricked you as the reader to respond to and ""treat"" the other character entirely differently when they are  female than when they are male - even though it is exactly the same person.  It is really eye opening.

But the thing is that for the vast majority of the existence of our species that wasn't always the case. Humans developed omnivorous diets to have a large variety of options when it came to feeding ourselves in situations of survival. If one source of food wasn't available we had a better chance of finding food from another source.

As much as I would love to see that all of this death stop, what would happen if some sort of worldwide catastrophe strikes and all of a sudden food (especially crops) is hard to come by? Would all this be okay if these were the circumstances?

I've always wondered where people draw the line between what kind of suffering is acceptable and what isn't. When you look at life on a global scale, countless organisms are dying all around us, often in horrible ways.

&gt; Timbaland &amp; Magoo left Swing Mob after 1995 and became a performing duo in their own right. Signing with Blackground Records (home of Aaliyah, one of Timbaland's main collaborators), Timbaland &amp; Magoo went on to release a number of albums, which were not as successful as the singles that anchored them. Singles such as ""Up Jumps the Boogie [Remix]"", ""Clock Strikes [Remix]"" (which samples the Knight Rider theme), ""Here We Come"" (which samples the 1960s Spider-Man theme), ""Drop"", ""All Y'all"", and ""Cop That Disc"" have all proved successful, while the albums that they appeared on have generally underperformed. Their first LP ""Welcome To Our World"" sold over 1 Million copies Read more on Last.fm.

EDIT: I did the full pasta

Did you ever hear the tragedy of Gary Kremen the Wise?

I thought not. It's not a story the normies would tell you. It's an Internet legend. Gary Kremen was a Dark Lord of the Internet, so powerful and so wise he could use the Web to set up algorithms to create romance... He had such a knowledge of internet dating that he could even keep the ones who paid him from loneliness. Internet dating is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so efficient... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his happiness, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his girlfriend about Match.com, then his girlfriend used the site to find someone new. Ironic, he could save others from loneliness, but not himself.

There are conflicting accounts of Diogenes' death. He is alleged variously to have held his breath; to have become ill from eating raw octopus;[36] or to have suffered an infected dog bite.[37] When asked how he wished to be buried, he left instructions to be thrown outside the city wall so wild animals could feast on his body. When asked if he minded this, he said, ""Not at all, as long as you provide me with a stick to chase the creatures away!"" When asked how he could use the stick since he would lack awareness, he replied ""If I lack awareness, then why should I care what happens to me when I am dead?""[38] At the end, Diogenes made fun of people's excessive concern with the ""proper"" treatment of the dead.

If you haven't clarified and weren't offered money you might ask. ""I know that you could use the story posted on Reddit without compensation, but I'm guessing that a clarified story, with my verification, would be better.

(Here's the thing Sarah, I don't know what to ask for. 500 pounds, 1,500? They might offer a low price like 50 or just say, ""Never mind."" But you could ask. From their point of view getting clarifications and permission could help them legally if the company who is mentioned in the story figures out is is you. (They usually edit these stories to make them as vague as possible in the actual piece for just that reason)

The thing is that the story doesn't make the COMPANY look bad, just an employee (who was fired for not following protocol). The company was clearly justified in firing the employee. It also can send a message to other managers that they should NOT do the same thing. So from the companies point of view they are clear. However the person who was fired might figure it out and decide that they were being libeled and want to sue Bored Panda and you. That is why it behooves Bored Panda to get your details so they can vet the story. It if is mostly real and they know what was changed to protect the guilty they will be better off knowing that.   On the other hand, they might just drop the whole story since they can find 20 other on Reddit in a day. It's really up to the person who is putting this together. They are probably a poorly paid person who knows a good story but doesn't want too much hassle. If you have a chance see if you can talk to them on the phone so you an get a better idea how these things work. They might tell you what they usually do when they get permission and how much they have paid for stories in the past. (Also other places might not care and just use your story off of Reddit.)

So here is the LINK to set up a google alert.

[https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-track-topics-with-google-alerts-and-inbox-by-gmail/](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-track-topics-with-google-alerts-and-inbox-by-gmail/)

My suggestion is to make a broad one at first which will catch too many similar stories. When you finally hit the one that you know is yours, make it more specific. This will help you catch the next company that takes it from Bored Panda. Then you can contact them and ask them to Pay Bored Panda for their use (since they might own the copyright of the edited story) or if they took it right from Reddit you can see if they linked to the original story. You can then point out that only BP has the correct story and if they continue to use the Reddit version they Lumber supply store will contact them (as they contacted you and BP )

Is this all too much of a headache? Sure. But I want you to be able to be paid for your fun story. Good luck, LLAP Spocko P.S. I'm [@](mailto:spockosemail@gmail.com)spockosbrain if you want to contact me via twitter&gt; I live in SF, CA.",1546301143

Pro-choicers dont care either. Hence why their only solution is increased funding for the welfare state. Pro-lifers at least typically support reducing things like single parent households and illegal immigration, which have a large and direct impact on low-skilled workers, which are what most babies in potential abortion situations will be subject to.

&gt;Most people who tend to be pro life also tend to despise social programs to aid the mother in caring for their child, at least in the United States.

Because giving someone everything they need doesnt foster independence.

&gt;Until we can reform the Foster care system and change the public opinion of social programs in the United States, Im staying pro choice.

Just admit it, you are pro-choice because killing it is easier for idiots than facing the very serious issues you and your ilk have created through the welfare state, third wave feminazism and the war on the nuclear family because identity politics is more important than a well functioning society.",1546301145

"conlangs","t5_2red7","As many of you know, I embarked on a year-long journey to add more words to Lortho's lexicon; an extension of Lexember 2017 which I coined as Lextreme2018 on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/lextreme2018) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/lextreme2018). There were a number of conlangers who started on 1 January 2018 as I did, some who joined later, but all in all there was good participation.

When I started, Lortho had 400 words. As of this writing, I successfully added 239 words bringing the total to 679 (the birth of our second child kinda shifted my focus for a couple months). I focused mainly on adding nouns and verbs; adjectives, adverbs, and grammatical features were many times byproducts.

There are currently 312 nouns and 205 verbs. Adjectives fall short by a large margin at merely 65.

_Verbs_: 

There are three verb classes. I tried to keep them as balanced as possible to make sure I was not leaning *too* much on one class.

-**o** verbs: 90  
-**n** verbs: 55  
-**t** verbs: 58

_Nouns_:

There are three noun classes and the same concept of balance was the goal.

**feminine**: 117  
**masculine**: 90  
**neuter**: 104

Throughout this exercise I was able to ""discover"" different aspects of the world in which Lortho is spoken to include environment, flora, fauna, religion, and life of the Lorthoans in general.

I will now shift my focus in 2019 on to the grammar of the language and perhaps continue another Lextreme challenge for my conlang ***Dhakhsh***.",1546301149

"Creation","t5_2t3sv","Faulkner's counter to the density wave theory:

&gt;By the late 1960s astronomers thought they had an answer. They devised the spiral density wave theory. According to this concept, the spiral arms act like sound waves in the very thin space between stars (interstellar medium, or ISM). If an outside force compresses the interstellar medium, clouds of gas and dust would arise in the spiral arms. In addition, the compression of the gas would supposedly form stars.

&gt;According to this view, some of the new stars should be massive blue stars with very short lifetimes (only a few million years at most, not billions of years). These stars are critical to making this idea work, but because they supposedly don‚Äôt last long, there isn‚Äôt enough time for the ‚Äúwave‚Äù to move along and leave behind the bright blue stars. So their theory proposed that the gravity of the galaxy stepped in to complete the process of collecting the material into stars.

Faulkner is a professional astronomer, but also a YEC.   I guess we'll have to wait and see how this plays out.

This article explains the density wave theory:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_wave_theory

It at least lays out the erasure problem.

There were other solutions than density wave theory.",1546301149

Since this closure is for construction, I'd be safe and double check.

If the facilities are closed, up on saddle across the street from the entrance to Mauna Kea is the parking lot for Puu Huluhulu. If it's clear up at the visitor's center, it's probably clear there too. There are some bathroom facilities there, and a hike up if the visibility is good.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","It doesn‚Äôt follow that two different people would see the same color, correct. Two identical people would have to see the same color if the mind is physical. Two different people could see different colors, but if the mind is physical, then those differences could always be explained physically.

If someone has malformed cones, then they‚Äôll certainly see colors differently than someone with well developed cones.

If the mind is physical, the eyes of two people are biologically similar (that is photoreceptors and the optic nerves are not functionally different), and neither person has a cognitive disorder pertaining to vision, then I‚Äôd wager that they would have to see the same color. If no physically functional difference exists and the mind is physical, then there is no physical basis to say they see different colors.

The consequence of a physical mind is that two identical people have to have the same qualia. If we extend that to the general case, if the mind is physical, the same would have to hold for two people with no *functional* difference between the eyes and the areas of the brain related to sight. Otherwise, you again introduce a non-physical factor, as the differences in qualia could not be explained by their visual faculties.

Thus, under the assumption of a physical mind, with sufficient observation, you could determine what people see colors the same.",1546301150

Not only that, but he championed reducing the national deficit. Instead, he doubled the deficit (from \~2.5% to 5% of GDP) within 2 years and tripled the national debt over the course of his presidency (from \~$738 billion to \~$2.1 trillion) Reagan was by far the worst president the US has ever seen at the time, and his legacy strongly lives on in the Republican party.

What could a BG do with a death note? BG already dies when protecting (assuming no Doctor), so their will is essentially a death note.

I hard support this, **but** it would have to be irreversible, ie, once you choose to forge someone‚Äôs will, you‚Äôve used up one of your three forges and can‚Äôt choose someone else. If you made the effect reversible, then Forger could just spend every night looking at everyone‚Äôs wills with no consequence, which would be insanely OP. 

&gt; med, janitor and retri [buff] upon dying you are told that at least one of these is in the game

Smart idea, but I‚Äôd include Necromancer in the message as well. 

&gt; mayor [buff] can reveal at night. idk why you would but you can

This is a nerf to evil roles. Claiming Mayor in jail is a way for evils to nab at least one more night, and if Mayor could reveal at night then Jailor would know to exe anyone who claims Mayor but won‚Äôt reveal.

It's such a shame that game hasn't managed to internalize all that stuff... but UI has never been their strong suit, and it's easier to have an external utility that spits out HTML than to develop systems for in-game consumption.  It took five years to add a search function to the talent tree... Dota2-style in-game character guides that let you pre-plan skill allocation and such are probably out of the question.

&gt;What do you people think of our wonderful President Donald Trump?
&gt;
&gt;In Christian America we love Trump. Love him! With his beautiful family, self made wealth and a smoking hot wife, he is everything a true man should aspire to!
&gt;
&gt;He is finally taking a stick to big secularism and is supporting true blue all American values.

**Useful Notes:**

* For videos shorter than one hour  
 Time: mm:ss --&gt; (00:00)
* For videos longer than one hour:  
 Time: hh:mm:ss --&gt; (00:00:00)
* Make a new timestamp anytime something happens to break the flow of audio, like a presenter finishing a paragraph, a large cut in the video, or something similar. You don't have to do it for every single line of dialogue. 
* There are **two spaces** after the timestamp, then a **return/enter** to make it look:
 
like  
this

* ...instead of:

like

this

* We **highly recommend** using [oTranscribe](http://otranscribe.com/) to help you with transcribing videos. Just give it the file or YouTube link to the video you are transcribing and copy / paste your finished work to the comment fields.

She knows he‚Äôs never want to leave her for Kimmy but is jealous over the idea of him sleeping with her and then that he did (even though she made him ‚Äúyou just wanted to fuck her...‚Äù) She was jealous over Annelise‚Äôs looks. She‚Äôs happy he won‚Äôt go to see Diedre. 

And she can be weird about sex. She feels guilty sometimes (hotel manager) and sex as expression of intimacy is very important to her. 

Plus, we know and she knows it‚Äôs not nothing to Philip. That he gets upset and jealous. And has tried to prevent her from doing that work (like with Yousef.) 

Most importantly, she is adament about Paige never having sex for info. And furious when she thinks she might be. If it didn‚Äôt matter why would it bother her so much if Paige did it? 

Elizabeth doesn‚Äôt really think sex is nothing. That part of the job takes a lot out of her. Knowing Philip is with other women takes a lot out of her. Knowing Philip knows she was out with other men takes a lot out of her. But it‚Äôs Elizabeth so she suppresses those emotions and justifies them as being for the greater good.",1546301154

Then what does it matter how mobile homeless people can become?

&gt; Just like I think it's wrong to see people get murdered en masse and respond with ""well there's absolutely nothing we can do to make this happen less."" 

Except you don't. I'm willing to bet you aren't within 6 degrees of a shooting victim because ""en masse"" shootings are so rare that they are considered a statistical anomaly. [in fact you are as likely to die by by the Government enacting the death penalty on you as you are to die in a mass shooting](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-are-we-afraid-of-mass-shootings#1)

[If you aren't](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gun-deaths/) a black man between ages 18-25 or a white man above age 45 and have no suicidal inclinations; you just arent that likely to die from gunfire.

 The fact that you patronize people who deliberately try to scare you into thinking its a much bigger problem than it is; [actually increases](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2016/08/media-contagion.aspx) the chances of another ""en masse"" shooting happening

Who's going to replace him?  

What top shot coach is going to want to take over at a school that just fired the best coach they have ever had, for having a mediocre season?

Especially when they realize they have to play Ohio State, Penn State, and Michigan every year.  Not to mention, usually a really good non conference team and then a top opponent from the B1G West.

If they are going to treat Dantonio that way, how will they treat a new coach that didn't already have the cache of the best run for the program in 50 years.

Also, that you are in a state that doesn't produce many blue chip prospects and you have to fight your rival, who has some built in advantages, to get them.

It would be tragic to the MSU program to fire Dantonio.  

Instead, just like Harbaugh he needs to make some changes to the offense and the MSU A.D. should pressure him to do that.

Not all dogs are people friendly either. Which isn't the same as being aggressive but they could also be scared and don't need a snot monster grabbing at them (which was my rescue dog due to past trauma)
I'm so sorry you went through this and you're 100% right about if someone doesn't want your service dog there they can say it and things are fine but if you say you don't want kids running around and ruining something you spent money on to enjoy then you're clearly a monster for not wanting to listen to screaming.",1546301158

"Blackops4","t5_2untl","This is the worst hit detection I've ever experienced in any game, period. At least once a week, I have the animation that my internet has been disconnected mid match. A couple nights ago on Militia, I slid into one of the buildings and was INSIDE THE BUILDING and died. I assumed there was another player that came around and shot me. Watch the kill cam and NOPE! On the kill cam I was dead outside the building before I slid. On my screen I slid successfully inside and evaded that players line of sight.

I average a 1.98 EKD and a 368 SPM...yet I get in lobbies where I'm trashed on by players using the same weapons and shooting first landing my shots. I enter many games and have to lead players with my shots. The worst is knowing some weapons so well you KNOW how they feel to get a kill with. Suddenly, they feel like they're taking 2-3 more shots to kill even without shooting against body armor. Body armor...good god, this crap is a major problem when you have connection issues too.

I've never played a game so sensitive to connections like this where they're all over the place.",1546301158

Your Echo isn't really ""awake"" all the time, only a tiny part of it is.  It's a small integrated chip hooked up to the microphone, it uses very little power and is extremely specific in its task - all it can do is recognize when the word ""Alexa"" is spoken.  There's no software to customize here, it's a literally a piece of hardware designed to recognize the wake word and that's all it can do.  This is why when you change the wake word, your Echo has to reboot, and only a few choices are available.

As soon as you speak the wake word, it immediately fires up the rest of the device, and buffers any words spoken after the wake word hopefully long enough to send the entire command to the Amazon cloud.",1546301159

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","&gt; If you want to see some interesting stats, look up MRI machine availability per capita in some of those countries. 

&amp;#x200B;

So all the MRI machines that are currently in the US will somehow be reduced? What does it matter what the MRI availability in other countries is when the US has quite a lot? I don't have the data and I assume there are rural or isolated areas that have fewer than they'd like, but most places in the US I think have the number they need. If they don't, then it's a failure of the market you're championing right now. 

&amp;#x200B;

And let's talk about that *free* market. It doesn't exist. Even if you got rid of all government regulation today, it *still wouldn't exist because free markets don't exist outside of academic theory.* If you look at history, the only time when you could truthfully say free markets *almost* existed, they not only didn't exist but also were bad news for most people. While there are certainly regulations that are obsolete or made to favor a faction over another, many regulations exist to protect the public good. When companies only consider the financial advantage of themselves, we have things like rampant pollution of our water ways and air, we have companies that cut corners on safety so that their employees are injured or killed or their consumers are sickened and/or killed. And we're not just talking about history - there are plenty of examples of companies today that exploit loopholes or who have crunched the numbers and determined it's cheaper to pay fines and lawsuits than change they way they do business to safeguard the health of their employees and consumers. So no, let's *not* remove all government regulation from healthcare just to save some money on the front end, when those savings are financed at the expense of people's health and lives.

You will then be forced to wait at least 4 business days with the funds on hold until you can draw on them.

I'm usually a little leary of pills, as they have an incentive to make the most profit off of the cheapest product.  You can easily buy a lot of turmeric, and it has a mild taste, it won't ruin most foods.  I've started putting it in to a lot of my sauces.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I cannot say cooked turmeric has the same effect, and I've ever eaten it for any specific reason, other than it's vitamin and flavanoid packed, and it tastes pretty good.  I dont have any particular health issues, but I was absolutely recommend adding it to your dietary regimen.  It's easy to use, food wise, and if it has extra benefits...enjoy.  It truly does add a nice flavor to food, though.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  I got a little off track from your question. But, if I would say just by raw Turmeric and eat it as is.  It definitely does not have a disagreeable taste...you may not be head over heals in love with it, but it's not a bad taste.  ",1546301162

It just didn't seem right that she wouldn't be reunited with her sister and her children again at the end, since so much of the book is about using faith and patient suffering as a source of strength.

Happy endings are also one of the reason why as I've gotten older, I've become more critical of Steven Spielberg's movies, even though I have extreme nostaglic love for his older movies that I grew up as a kid.

First, open the registry editor by typing regedit into search or a run window. Browse to to HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt; I just like consistency in my rules. 

I finally agreed to play pathfinder again with some friends after playing a bunch of storyteller games for years. So I sit down, and the players have like a passing understanding of the rules, with the DM slightly more in tune with them. He insists on doing all of the boring rolls, but when it comes to penalties and things, he kind of ignores them. Enter my fighter rogue. I have skills and abilities which depend on surprise, flanking, denial of dex bonus, etc. for attacks of opportunity, class skills, and feats. So when he ignores it with other players, I know he's ignoring it with the enemy. I mean, look, I don't want to be a dick and point out when the monster should be getting an attack of opportunity on another character, but I can't just sit there and have it ignored, because i know when it comes my turn, I'll have to point it out again. And if I take a feat or class skill that allows me to mediate an opponents advantage, it's meaningless if the opponent never does said thing. 

I feel like if you don't want to pay attention to the rules that closely, and i really don't, why aren't they playing savage worlds or something? Everyone is playing pathfinder but no one seems to like the crunch? /rant

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Well first off you have one of the fictional characters notice that the Real World Character (RWC) knows far more than they should or has a better insight to a problem far quicker or with less information than everyone else.

So the Fictional Character could go to the tribe leader and propose a test, the forbidden area is somewhere people aren't allowed to go so the RWC shouldn't have any knowledge of it. But because they suspect something about them, not necessarily that they are from a world where they are fiction mind you, but if this person knows about the Forbidden area, then it's grounds to bring them before the leader.

Or the tribal leaders could have decided that if the RWC passes the test they use him and his knowledge with no regard to his feelings on it or not.

I feel that is something a lot of writers don't do when writing an Isekai style character, they don't have the character get exposed until way later on, if a government structure became aware that a person knew they were fictional and had prior knowledge of how their entire world functioned that person would become priority one.

The tribe could approach this deceptively, with the attitude that treating them nicely will give good results, or they could hold them captive until the information starts leading to too many changes in their world and becomes more unreliable.

Are their other tribes that the information would be used against, does the RWC have explicit loyalty to this tribe.

I the RWC easily swayed by praise or attention, can this be used against them in the future to get knowledge that the main character may have been holding onto.",1546301164

I'm not going to send them to daycare just so I can work at a checkout or clean offices and make minimum wage, which is like 350 dollars a month in the country I live in right now.  I have no education past high school and I did totally crap.  Any job I am capable of getting will be shitty and my husband would likely demand to take control of my income anyway.  I still wouldn't be able to get my teeth fixed or to be able to afford to support myself or my kids.  I don't know why you have to be such a fucking bitch about it.  Educated, feminist women are the fucking worst to everyone including other women who they think are below them.  They think they are the fucking shit for having a career and owning a hoard of ugly shitty flea ridden cats and they treat other women who they don't see as accomplished as they are like dirt.  Go and fuck yourself you feminist dyke.  Most feminists do shitty jobs like social work anyway.  I could probably do that shit as you don't need much education but I'm not evil enough.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","One study where people believed one thing where their beliefs were based upon a false/deceived premise is not the same or even if it were, you do not exclude other data/results because one study says ONE thing that is different.

It's called the Black Swan Theory: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black\_swan\_theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory)

Just because you've never witnessed a black swan and only white swans (your particular study), does not negate the existence of the Black Swan (my studies and news presented in the video provided above).  You are not dealing with the facts and data provided and are only masking the entire issue with your one study (based upon the Nocebo effect - which, like the Placebo effect, is a measurable, quantifiable effect).  How about a case study of people (like the Firefighters) who were confused and had memory loss that happened at the same time a new 5G tower was put up?  Nocebo?  Did they really feel this way?  Can you say they didn't?  Are you negating their actual accounts and data?  Who are you to say they didn't feel this way, nocebo or not?

Science is difficult.  You're consensus version of science, is not science - period.  Science is evolving, ever-growing in a direction of truth.  It is never done.

&gt;‚ÄúI want to pause here and talk about this notion of consensus, and the rise of what has been called consensus science. I regard consensus science as an extremely pernicious development that ought to be stopped cold in its tracks. Historically, the claim of consensus has been the first refuge of scoundrels; it is a way to avoid debate by claiming that the matter is already settled. Whenever you hear the consensus of scientists agrees on something or other, reach for your wallet, because you're being had.Let's be clear: the work of science has nothing whatever to do with consensus. Consensus is the business of politics. Science, on the contrary, requires only one investigator who happens to be right, which means that he or she has results that are verifiable by reference to the real world. In science consensus is irrelevant. What is relevant is reproducible results. The greatest scientists in history are great precisely because they broke with the consensus.There is no such thing as consensus science. If it's consensus, it isn't science. If it's science, it isn't consensus. Period.‚Äù

"gambling","t5_2qhuo","OP , have you consider bitcoin based online casino? Bitcoin is still very much at its infancy stage, but this hasn‚Äôt prevented it from being widely accepted across different organizations including online casinos. But what makes the different casino portals to trust this unsure payment method to incorporate it into their sites? Below are some of the main reasons.  

Very Fast and Cheap Transactions

In the modern casino and gambling era, bettors seem to prefer Bitcoin casinos that promises a faster and cheaper way of getting money into and out of their account. Well, there are plenty of payment options that promise this, but none does it better than BTC.

A typical BTC fee will cost you a little transfer fee for every transaction you make. As compared to the credit cards which will charge you 3-5% commission for the total amount you‚Äôll be transacting, this makes BTC very cheap and one of the ways which players prefer!

It‚Äôs Totally Safe and Secure

Unlike traditional payment option, credit cards and eWallets, Bitcoins have proven to be the safest and most secure payment methods online. See, while scammers have found a way of hacking and getting some of the information on the ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô payment options, Bitcoins have proven to be very difficult. This is because they use a modernized encryption technology that keeps all your personal information safe.

Decentralization

I wasn‚Äôt well aware of this fact until just recently. Apparently, the US central bank wanted to take all deposits that were uninsured and larger than $100,000 in a bid to help recapitalize itself. The result was most people became very unsettled and more chose to shift to Bitcoins.

Well, unlike the hard liquid cash that the government has control over, BTC is decentralized, meaning that its value is not dictated by the government or any person in particular. Instead, the value of Bitcoin is determined by the demand.

I would recommend VegasCasino.io because it accept all nationalities from worldwide, free training mode without any deposit , huge deposit bonus , free spin &amp; etc. Hope this help a little OP.  ",1546301166

We watched a commercial about Low T and it checked all his symptoms. Asked for a blood test and bang super low T.

Unfortunately from what I understand not allot of research has been done between why some young men with depression also have low t but what is worth noting is supplementing the low t with testosterone is very successful in treating the depression and suicidal thoughts.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I doubt that Martin as an author would accept this tinfoil, despite this I'm glad that you've already done this writeup on this take.

I would argue that this reptilian form to the Valyrians once had a symbiotic relationship with them or even held greater power than the human host. This reptilian 'dragonlink' would have been what let the Valyrians bind dragons to their will or  even fertilise/incubate (without the necessary conditions) dragon eggs. This would put the dragons in a relationship with the Valyrians where the Valyrians could continue the life cycle of the dragons and gain mastery over them as sole arbiters of their race. So the dragons once gifted a small group of humans this parasite/gift in order to prevent their own extinction in the depths of Valyria. 

However this ability to gift humanity with a 'dragonlink' was lost or forgotten by the dragons, this likely then kick starts the Valyrians obsession with purity of blood and incest. So then in the freehold as long as they only mated with other bearers of a 'dragonlink' there would be no adverse effects and the child would have one too. Unfortunately the reason for this need for keeping the blood pure was also lost. Now fast forward to the post-doom Valyrians, either they had already bred with normal people or would soon do so. Now the Targaryens remembered to keep the blood pure but not why, so slowly began marriages with other houses. These impure pregnancies could cause complications, see maegor's children or in certain extreme circumstances create the fleshworms already mentioned. So at least some of the issues attributed to incest could ironically be caused by a lack of it. (Note: I highly doubt that the Targaryens and Velaryons were completely pure blood even in the Conquerer's day.

This could also mean as complications with the 'dragonlink' appear because of the dilution of Valyrian blood the dragons would directly grow weaker and not because of some plot of the maesters. Also why the eggs hatched with Dany and not any sooner.

This is simply an extrapolation of your theory and has no real evidence other than it neatly explains more of the mysteries of the Valyrians. Honestly I don't really think my idea is true but I do think that it is an interesting way of looking at it. ",1546301171

We had to decline this year but invited them over around 4:00 for the kids to decorate some cookies for Santa and so we could all mingle a bit. Our routine was kept for our babies allowing them to get a normal nights sleep and we were better rested for Christmas Day than we would have been if we had tried to mess with their schedule. We also plan our grocery trips etc during the day between naps. It‚Äôs so hard but our days and nights go so much better when our routine/rhythm is kept.

-maybe even a brief history of said combo Rhystic Studies style. Many of them are iconic in some way and often got ported over from modern or legacy

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","I think 

    while (!Serial.isAvailable()) {
        player_number = Serial.parseInt();
    }

is wrong. 

You are executing the method body when there is no input available yet. Inside the method body the parseInt will wait for input for a while, which is why your first attempt works.

However on subsequent times there is input (the \n after your number, the enter key you press) and you notice: isAvailable = true, so you never read it.
isAvailable should then continue to always be true as you never read the \n so it does not get discarded.

[Read this article](https://www.norwegiancreations.com/2017/12/arduino-tutorial-serial-inputs/) on how you should do it. 

Basically, you don't need a while loop inside your loop. Let your ""loop()"" do your waiting for input for you. If no input: skip loop. if there is input then do stuff.
That way you don't accidentally make the one iteration of loop() take up a lot of cpu.

(if you do game programming, perhaps loop() is a little like update())

quick ninja edit: the linked article does readString: I do not mean you should use that method, just that the way to lay out the loop() method and the use of isAvailable() can be taken from there.",1546301176

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm going to do a terrible job at answering this question, but it's entertaining nonetheless.

This happened to my wife, not me. When she was a podiatry student, she worked very closely with some medical students both during her preclinical and clinical years. The medical students around her were DO students, meaning they learn the same things as MD candidates, but they also learn osteopathic manipulative medicine (OMM for short). OMM in short, because there's too much to explain, is basically techniques that can help you relieve any sort of bodily dysfunctions, like low back pain, neck pain, headaches, point tenderness to any part of the body, etc, etc. Several of these techniques require you to be very up-close-and-personal with the patient.

Well, during one of my wife's clinical rotations as a student, she was having some pain (I don't remember where) and asked to one of her DO classmates to treat her. Her classmate had her lay down on the table and one of those patient rooms so that she could work on her site of pain. Whatever the technique that she was doing required the DO student to basically be on top of my wife to some degree.

It doesn't matter to what degree though because a nurse opened the door and walked into the patient room to the sight of two girls, one on top of the other. The nurse got flustered, said, ""oh my, I'm sorry,"" and walked out while closing the door. My wife was too mortified to explain what was going on to the nurse (nor would she have had the time). So for all that nurse knows, two girls were getting it on in the patient's room.",1546301177

Oh they do push for the upheaval of the ""system"" and a new establishment. Even though there may be a large enough disparity of groups in the sub, they share an equal policy when it comes to capitalism and how it sucks. That's ultimately what it is doing, it is trying to make a user take up the metaphorical flag for anti-capitalism. 

The mods of LCS are mostly hard-line MLs, the fact that you think it's full of SuccDems like yourself is proof at how open they are to conversation so long as it's reasonably Leftist.

I've seen guys get banned for participating in other subs before coming to LSC. The fact that they only allow certain discussions to take place that can only say things that promote the general sentiment doesn't strike you as cultish?

&gt;The proof of it's effectiveness can be seen in Bernie, AOC, Leftist podcasts like Chapo, r/Breadtube, and how much of it's memes leak into r/Politics discussions.

So the indoctrination point is valid. 

&gt;T_D also can point to the multiple terrorist attacks like Charlottesville, the MAGABomber, the Synagogue shooter, and others as proof of their influence.

From another comment you made:
&gt;&gt;I agree T_D doesn't try to radicalise users to one specific political opinion like LSC does. ... it important to bring up T_D when attacking LSC because I wanted to avoid any perception that I'm right wing when in reality I'm a pretty far left Social Democrat.

OP obviously felt the need to combat both as to avoid criticisms of being anti-left. I mean, I can't blame him though, I can imagine someone spouting that kind of rhetoric to discredit OP. It was more a preemptive strike.",1546301178

Learn security as a separate topic and integrate it into your workflows at every step! Start with the OWASP top 10 for web applications and go from there.

Or [here is an image](https://www.mh-aerotools.de/airfoils/images/velo6.gif). Understand that most of the lift comes from the **top surface**. 

Note: don't use the word 'thrust' in this context or someone will crucify you!

Stall is a big topic but it helps to understand 'adverse pressure gradients' within the boundary layer. The boundary layer [loses its momentum](https://aerospaceengineeringblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/boundarylayeraerofoil.jpg). When it runs out of sufficient momentum near to the surface (or energy per unit volume) it doesn't have the energy to plow through to the trailing edge; it detatches.

You can delay the detatchment by tripping the boundary layer. It makes sense because you are re-introducing freestream energy into the boundary layer. The small-scale turbulence reintroduces energy and keeps it attached for longer, resulting in less form drag. A bit like a whales '[tubercles](https://secretofflight.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/humbackwhale.jpg)' on its leading edge to delay stall, or the dimples on a golf-ball to reduce drag.",1546301179

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt; As of today I am 198. I lost weight by diet and weight training to build muscle

Good job, that's good progress and shows dedication and consistency.

&gt; but the problem is I look in the mirror and I still see a belly and slightly man boobage.

I'd expect that for someone with your height/weight who hasn't been training for very long.

&gt; I thought that once I was below 200 I wouldnt be that overweight

You were overweight before.  You are much less so now, but the problem is you're realizing that it takes more than not being fat to look good.

&gt; my question is at this point should I continue my calorie deficit and weight training or should I try something else like more intense weight training alone?

I would recommend you continue to do what you're doing now.  This early in your training career, you can continue to build strength while dropping weight, as long as your calorie deficit isn't *too* huge.  Very strict cutting and bulking diets are necessary for someone who's been training for a long time, but at your stage you can and should enjoy the best of both worlds.  It's easier to both build muscle and lose weight when you're first starting at both.  Later on, once you begin to plateau more significantly, you'll need to focus more heavily on one or the other.

&gt; Am I losing muscle?

Since you reference strength training as part of your progress and don't mention feeling weak or getting weaker at all, I'd guess you are probably building muscle.  You don't mention any of your metrics in the gym, so we can't be sure.

&gt; And If i should continue to loose weight what is an ideal weight for me to stop?

It's really up to you when you stop.  I wouldn't say there's enough info here to make a strong recommendation, but if your goal is to be slim/""toned,"" continue dieting until you reach that goal or your diet begins to significantly restrict your strength progress (which it will eventually).",1546301180

I went through and found it.

So, 9 hour wait possibly for a fake broken arm with no serious symptoms. I am in the US, and I had a 4.5 hour wait for my friend who had lost consciousness after having his hand crushed in a door. I have had insane emergency room waits when the symptoms aren't serious. I have also wandered in with a minor cut that needed stitches and had no wait,to see because the ER want busy. It depends on the other patients and... Makes sense. It is called triage.

Getting your arm looked at the same day is all that is important. If the symptoms are more serious, you move up in priority.

I don't get it, are you just really innocent or something to not know the US is actually just as bad, if not worse in these cases. The non serious medical issues are when the US system outshines the Canadian system, as long as you have the money or great insurance.",1546301181

Rhaenrya made a lot of bad choices during her rule, that's for sure. Honestly her worst choice was not mounting syrax and saving the dragons in the dragonpit. Rhaenyra was kind of a bad queen, but she also wasn't dealt the greatest hand here. Pretty hard to be a good queen when your brother forces the realm into civil war. 

Also, that doesn't mean Aegon was a good ruler. What ruling did he even do? Both militarily and politically, it seems to me that he did very little of the actual decision making. He was a puppet of his mother and grandfather and whole hightower apparatus. 

In summation, both proved to be shitty rulers, but Aegon was a usurper propped up by the Hightowers and was ultimately the reason Rhaenyras ""reign"" was so shitty because he caused a literal civil war. ",1546301181

Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage

1st John 5:5

Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that Jesus is the Son of God?

Jesus has already given you freedom. The devil wants you to believe that ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt do it‚Äù. Truth is by yourself you can‚Äôt , but with help you can. You‚Äôre an overcomer of the world if you believe in Jesus. The devil can tempt you but he can‚Äôt control you anymore. Memorize those two verses and use them against the devil just like Jesus did when he was tempted in Matthew 4. Also read Ephesians and learn about the armor. The shield of faith is the most important part. Have faith that you have been given power and freedom, remember who you are through Jesus, use the verses and take at least 5 minutes a day to close your eyes and just think of those verses and to think of your freedom. The battle has already been won

Psalms 51 is also a good chapter to read and pray on and remember the freedom that can‚Äôt be removed from you every single day you wake up.

Also don‚Äôt let your mind wander. You get tempted, start rejecting the temptation immediately. Also read my latest post. It can offer more help with some of the same verses and more information. Get a kjv bible and read it everyday",1546301183

Like a drivers license, you would have to renew your gun license. During the renewal, you would go through another psychological examination and then produce all the firearms that you own. If you cannot produce all of your registered firearms, you go to jail. ",1546301183
