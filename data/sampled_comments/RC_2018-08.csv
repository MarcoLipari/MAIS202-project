Heavier people can have more muscle to generate power, but also have that extra weight that the have to move with that power. So the important thing is finding that fantastic middle ground where you have the maximal power to move your weight. 
Don‚Äôt worry about judging yourself against LeBron. The man is an athletic and genetic freak. A freight train. He is pushing what we consider to be human limits. One of the most interesting parts of LeBrons life from a physiological point of view will be what happens to his body once he retires and starts to get old, because at the moment he seems to be defying age. 
(Sorry for the spiel) For you though, just remember that adding muscle and weight may make you more explosive if you train right, but that also means more weight for that power to then move.

Most of the reason why men are here is because they were unattractive and overlooked in the dating/courtship realm or their wives ""loved them but weren't in love with them.""

Attraction matters because most of them are obtained from being successful with God's marital roles and responsibilities matter. As a husband gets better at the Scriptural roles and responsibilities, he will become an excellent masculine leader, protector, and provider which are attractive to women. 

This increase in attraction will tend to jump start their sex life in marriage again, and for singles it will increase the percentage of women that will accept when they ask them out on dates.

The fact that we have to discuss attraction in the first place sucks because the Church won't do it. What pastor is going to tell their singles congregation that they should hit the weights and get on a good nutrition plan to become more attractive to women if they want to go on more dates and lessen the chance of rejection? What pastor is going to tell their married couples that obesity is unattractive to both husbands and wives and that's a reason why their frequency of sex is decreasing?

He said ""If I had only a few days left to live.."".

""His dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp it. He did not know that it was already behind him.""

Getting caught while trying to switch between high/low block is most likely because you're not doing it fast enough. Even if it feels like you are, you might be a few frames too slow. Especially online, where you have to account for frame delay. It can also happen if you're trying to go from crouching to standing and accidentally hit up-back.

Getting caught coming down from the air usually happens because the defending player is already holding down-back, but the attacking player is still airborne. So the defender hits the ground, immediately crouch blocks, and gets clipped by the overhead before the attacker lands. Or they're holding up-back and getting hit during pre-jump frames.",1533081607

Although current 1080Ti is barely good for 8K, 1180 is 25% better and 1180Ti will be hopefully 40 - 45% better than 1080Ti, you need something like twice the power of 1080Ti for 8KX.

I eat a primarily plant based diet with a lot of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, but I definitely notice feeling stronger when my diet has a little bit of meat in it, especially fish and red meat 1-2x a week (to prioritize heme iron absorption).  I don't eat a ton of dairy beyond hard cheese and butter due to lactose intolerance. I go whole days without animal products and definitely keep the portions small with meat (1 small steak is 2 meals for me), but I tend to recover better with a little bit of omnivory.

From the picture you posted there‚Äôs a full frost pattern shown so you don‚Äôt need to worry about anything with the sealed system. An issue with the operating thermostat would have symptoms like staying on too long, freezing food/shutting off completely for long periods of time. To test that your defrost circuit operates correctly make sure it‚Äôs been running at least several hours. Take a flat head screw driver and on the bottom of the temperature control knob area there‚Äôs a hole where the defrost timer can be turned. You‚Äôll know it when you see it. Turn it until you hear a click and when the fan and compressor turns off it is now in defrost. After about 5-15 mins open the freezer for awhile and listen for hissing noises. If you hear the freezer section hissing we know that the defrost circuit is good and the defrost timer that controls it is bad.

I mean personally I would be pretty upset if someone steals my land and than cuts it off with a wall.

Something doesn't add up. Completely possible that Tartary was simply surrounded and put under pressure and their defense was then put into history books as aggression. Everyone just hated the Tartars it seems, and their world got smaller and smaller over time.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;But what if it is shown that allowing people to say that Americans are lesser people increases the amount of violent anti-american attacks? Would you still allow it?

As long as these individuals are not directly advocating direct violence themselves, yes.  The guilt lies with people who turn their hate to violence.  Someone who hears extreme ideas and turns them into evil acts is responsible for that alone.  To say otherwise is to deny the agency and responsibility each of us has for our own actions.

&gt;Oh you're one of those people. Someone who doubts the effectivity of all modern western societies, just because we are not all of the same colour and do not all have the same traditions.

Quite the opposite.  The paradox you present doubts it, because it assumes some external force (suppression of freedoms) is needed to hold different people together.  I believe that people, when in a society that promotes liberty and prosperity, will naturally move away from hate and towards cooperation even without hate speech laws.It takes time, there will be setbacks, as the wounds of history are deep, but largely we march ever forward if you look at the arc of history.  I'm happy to hear your friend feels at home, and hope everyone does, but when it comes to welcoming people of all backgrounds to feeling like part of society, we do relatively well overall: [http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2015/sd-agenda2030/RobertoFoaPaper.pdf](http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/egms/docs/2015/sd-agenda2030/RobertoFoaPaper.pdf)",1533081617

Lastly, are you working? If not, ask if you qualify for a work study program. If not, try to pick up a part time job on or around university campus. I was lucky enough to have a part time job in second year and it covered the shortfall between financial aid and what I actually needed to pay for loans.

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","&gt; In my experience, leadership will say they want ""a single pane of glass"" for encryption across all platforms. It's stupid af and makes it harder for us to support Macs, because now we have to wait for our encryption client to get updated for each new version of macOS.

+elevnty million upvotes!

So, we had the same debacle at my Org.  They wanted to centralize FDE keys. My team, which does all the Mac IT and related services for all Macs at my Org met with the people that wanted the single pane of glass.  

I explained to them that yes, I can setup a redirect profile to ship the FV2 to any service, but they did not want to host anything, they wanted to just direct DB connector to my services and grab it.  I explained, it doesn't work that way, that you will need to build an API or an App I can ship data to. From there how you consume it and how you put it into your systems is 100% up to you.

Then I mentioned that their service must be publicly exposed, as we have Mac Clients off campus and off network all the time, and all of our services are in The Cloud.  So, they will need to expose an API or an appliance to the Internet to escrow the keys.  They were like we cannot do that.  Then I said they would be solely responsible for all FDE keys, data, and integrity of said keys and rotation of said keys because once it leaves our systems we have zero control over any of it.

At the end of my meeting with the team responsible for the single pane of glass of FDE keys, they basically said they were not interested in doing any of that because it was too much work.  So, that was the one and only meeting I ever had about shipping the FV2 keys to a centralized system for the single pane of glass.",1533081618

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","My reasoning is that I can't figure out what makes the Doctor so very British in the first place.

* It's not race, so we can get that off the table right away; the whole idea that the Doctor must look like someone who might have been waiting on the shore when the Normans came calling doesn't hold up. I'd love to see Adrian Lester or Sacha Dhawan play the Doctor.

* It's not the accent, plainly; we've had a couple of Scots, a Northerner (two, soon), lots of Queen's English... there's been a lot of variety there, even if they've all been from the UK. I can't see that there's anything radically different about choosing an American accent over a British one, especially given the variety of accents we already have here. It's not as though the Doctor always has to fit into a particular UK regional stereotype. Lots of planets have a North. Lots of planets probably have a America (or equivalent) too.

* Is it a sort of *quintessential Britishness*? Well, what does that even mean? The role would still be written largely by British writers; the humour and sentiment would still be largely British, rather than having an American flavour to it. Would it even be noticeable if an American actor did a flawless British accent (the same way Hugh Laurie did in reverse for *House*)? I'd argue that that wouldn't matter -- but in that case, we just go back to the accent point from above. To say that there's a *quintessential Britishness* implies that there *is* something that can be caricatured, and that it and only it is right for this one particular character -- a sentiment that has to pervade the character. Well, we've had twelve different versions of this one guy and they've all been super different to each other. I find it difficult to agree with the idea that the one thing that links every iteration is an unknowable British vibe, so I think this one's out too.

* Is it an out-of-universe issue? That one seems the most compelling. The idea of the show being British through and through -- like *Harry Potter*, where Rowling insisted on a British cast -- might be a big part of its appeal. In that case, though, could we have an American companion? Would that somehow break the illusion of it being a show that *we* made? I don't think so. The leap to an American Doctor doesn't seem all that far after that.

Can I think of any Americans offhand that I'd like to play the Doctor? No, not really -- but that doesn't really mean much; I'm not a casting director, and this is just a hypothetical. I'm not saying I think this is something that *should* happen. But could it?

Well, I can't see why not.",1533081619

Therefore: If the playstyle revolves around a lot of QTE switching from then go for mixed set.

If playstyle is mainly using memento to kill enemies and not much of switching QTE then use full nohime set. Nohime set works much better when using memento solo mainly.

Nobody is suggesting people should ""have to shit all over the floor because they don't have a toilet.""  Nobody is saying there should be no ""health regulations.""

If the landlord offers 10,000,000 stations of movies and a 2,000"" television and the tenet agrees then that is what needs to happen.  If the landlord tells the tenet the property doesn't include running water and the tenet accepts it, then that's what they get.

Allow the market to do its job and if someone wants to rent a property with no toilet then great, if not, the landlord will need to install one in order to win someone's business.

Well my classmate can't help but see me as a rival and plays that as a zero-sum game, where winning = beating others.

And we dated. When I stood up to her continuous low-key abuse (not in the most adult way... first a few days of silent treatment before I had cooled off enough to have a direct conversation), she cut me off. She's completely ignoring me now. My attempt to talk with her was rewarded by niceties like ""It doesn't matter since you're leaving"".

I was so hurt, my BPD symptoms became strong enough for me to remember this list I had heard a few years ago, so I went to my therapist with that idea and was diagnosed.

I am friends with plenty of people I work around, friends work fine, maybe it's a bit more delicate if you directly work with them. I don't know how you'd tolerate a workplace where you're not friend with anyone! Dating proved to be a mistake, but this girl clearly got her own issues.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","A success is measured, in metaphorical terms, by each of the bricks that made it up as a wall. Since it was a success, all that matters is the parts used to make it surpass the required amount; everything taken to complete the whole becomes part of the whole, and it's easier far and away to see it like this.

When it's a failure, it's not the completed pieces, the additions, the inclusions, or the smaller success that just couldn't measure up that are analyzed--it's everywhere the whole failed. It's pointless to say, ""Well, that was 88% of a win, nice job."" No one wants to be complacent with failure, no one wants to write it off as luck or an immutable, fated outcome. So instead, it's a measure of how *close* the whole was to success. Instead of looking at the successes, it's much easier to find the failures one by one and piece together why the end result couldn't stack up.

In the case of a team, unless it's an absolute stomp (which has its own mental problems associated with it) there's always a few shortcomings. These fall into areas of surety and areas of possibility. Losing lane matchup? That's a guaranteed negative strike to the team. It can be overcome, it can be met with an active jungler or smart play, it can be worked or built around by the player in question, sometimes... but it's an absolute detriment that *must* be dealt with. It exists in the game once the game starts and must be handled.

A bad build, on the other hand, isn't an instability the team *has* to work around... it's one the team is *made* to work around. This is an area someone has specifically chosen for themselves; it means a teammate has made this decision that could very well make the game harder for the team as a whole, and then they as a result must deal with it. Not from a place of necessity, but from a place of perceived carelessness or ignorance.

It's not a guarantee that, say, a full-AP Garen cost your team the game. But if you look everywhere, all over the game's events and stats and the history of everything, that stands out. Here's four members of the team giving it their all, and here's a Garen who intentionally set out to do something off-the-wall and purposefully useless, for the sake of a joke, that *could* have done better. Maybe it wouldn't have been a problem if the game was going better, or if there was no early invade, or if the right enemy became the villain to Garen's passive, and so on. But when everything lines up, the question stops being, ""Why did we lose?"" almost instantly, and becomes a number of smaller questions, such as, in this case, ""How much better could we have done with a real Garen build?""

Yes, people will point out and specifically call to intentionally lackluster choices made by teammates when shit goes south. Part of it is perhaps justified, if uncalled for anger, but another part is a clear violation of the unspoken social contract team games forge in most people. Everyone else on the team queued up to give 100%--why is it so hard for this one person? Or so the thought process goes.",1533081623

I first saw this term being used almost four years ago (late 2014, early 2015) in the run-up to the coming Canadian election in 2015. Members of the Canadian hate-subreddit MetaCanada were using the phrase ""Harper derangement syndrome"" to attack anyone who was critical of then-prime minister (Conservative) Stephen Harper and his policies, actions, words, etc.

Make no mistake. This is deliberate, planned, and coordinated. This is yet another attempt by the hate-filled alt-right to attack anyone who doesn't peddle their caustic views or support their team.

Also, I don't know what sort of alfredo sauce you have, but if it is homemade or higher quality, the water may upset the sauce as it simmers off by causing the cheese to separate. A regular store bought alfredo is probably stable enough to be fine, but I wouldn't risk it. ",1533081630

After the first two died the third one went in and died 1v5 (we were already down 2 levels). So my friend and I decided we'd get the sapper camps and push them in so we could get at least a fort down. Well the first two that died started snapping about how terrible we are because we didn't go contest the skull boss with two people vs five. So they basically spent the rest of the match mocking us for getting camps when we lost the skull fight. Because we would lose the skull fight every time as the team would trickle in and the two doing the mocking had no desire to wait 20 seconds for everyone to group up. They would just yolo one or two vs the enemy team and then call the rest of us baddies. So basically about half way into the match until the end team chat was scrolling away as the two explained how the camps are completely worthless and the only thing that matters on that map is skulls even if we're level 20 and we all die in the process to get 19 skulls while the enemy team gets the rest cause that's WAY better than surviving and pushing camps into the enemy's lanes. Funny thing is the only reason we got the forts down is because of my friend and I pushing sappers into them....

&gt; If you want big blocks you hold BCH. If you want small blocks and segwit you hold BTC. Everyone who holds participates in voting with their dollars.

&gt; We were discussing what the original bitcoiners want and the best way to determine that is with polls and reddit conversations.
&gt; 
&gt; I have shown you a poll that supports this argument. I could also show you chat conversations where every developer agreed with bigger blocks. I can also point to the moment the original bitcoiners were silenced and kicked out of the major communication channels.
&gt; 

You haven't shown me anything. You rudely told me to look something up. I remember the poll. I remember not participating and I believe it is meaningless. The current market cap is irrefutable. People want Bitcoin more than they want Bitcoin cash. That is reality.

&gt; You can tell yourself whatever you like, but the original bitcoiners wanted bigger blocks

The bitcoiners at the fork and every moment since the fork for the last year have preferred the smaller block version of bitcoin. The big block bitcoin called bitcoin cash is not used, and valued less and less relative to bitcoin each day.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","The average family or individual cannot pay for quality mental health care and the majority of places (group programs) available are not covered by health insurances thus must be paid out of pocket. For instance in trying to transfer to a cheaper program the program was still an out of pocket 19,000 for the first month. That‚Äôs not accounting for if you need to be residential or inpatient. Even then if you TRY to be reimbursed through your health insurance (and if you‚Äôre very lucky they might help with some of the cost but not nearly enough) then they can begin to dictate how long you can be in it - not the professionals treating you. 

Not all health insurance plans cover the cost of some medications either. 

Trying to navigate the maze that is health insurance and quality care is next to impossible for sustained continued treatment. 

Even if you find an individual psychologist and not a group you‚Äôre still looking at between 150-300ish per session and depending on your needs you might need multiple sessions per week. You might also need a psychiatrist. Luckily you see them only once a month or every other month just for med management. Add more cost on top. 

So most people with regular and ok health care have to try to not only navigate between what‚Äôs good for them and what works with what insurance will agree with still pay mostly out of pocket be told when to stop even if they still need it have to shop around for a therapist and a psychiatrist you click with practices the therapy types you need and can afford and spend years even if you get lucky with all of the above finding a med combination that finally helps you stabilize enough to work in better cohesion with your therapy. 

People without health care or basic health care will likely never find quality help. People with premium top of the line coverage will still end up paying out of pocket for the majority of it and spend their time fighting with the insurance companies that don‚Äôt want to help out anymore. 

Not to mention in a lot of cases there just isn‚Äôt anything near you requiring you to travel for it with longer daily commutes adding to gas expenses or have to go residential which averages about 20-30k a month. 

Psych ‚Äúwards‚Äù are for acute care and average between three to seven days maximum. (You usually start off with three and they evaluate you and if you‚Äôre not a danger doesn‚Äôt matter how you feel you‚Äôre released or its extended to fourteen days after that but you likely won‚Äôt stay the full duration) and it‚Äôs expensive. 

Bottom line you have to fight to get it and fight to keep it and can have it taken away at the drop of a hat or not be able to afford it anymore. Medications that help even come with their own set of ongoing and lasting problems. 

I doubt you could find a single redditor in the US who has experience in the system that would disagree with me in saying a gun would be easier to obtain than sustained quality care. Mental health care in the US is a absolute shit show.

There is considerable adoption.

Over 12,000 BloomID‚Äôs have been created. We have live partnerships with dozens of lenders. We‚Äôve shipped a robust developer ecosystem. (https://bloom.co/docs/). A number of applications are building on top of our infrastructure, we‚Äôve highlighted some of them here: https://blog.hellobloom.io/tagged/partnership

&gt; Why can‚Äôt you ship an app that lets someone login to an existing account?

We have shipped this. You can create an account and login here: https://bloom.co/app/.

In addition, you can currently signup for beta of our mobile app. This mobile app is the first of its kind, requiring little-to-no blockchain knowledge or gas fees.

&gt; At what point is Bloom willing to admit it‚Äôs a failure?

Bloom is live on Mainnet. Thousands of people are using our app. This activity can be monitored publicly.

We‚Äôre pushing the ecosystem forward on UX, Whisper Protocol, and usability. You can read about this on our blog.

Bloom is engaged at the executive level with a number of banks and financial institutions. This translates to real, global adoption, far outside of the crypto niche.

Great projects are not built overnight.

&gt; Is Bloom willing to do token buy backs, burn tokens or pay to be listed on legit on an exchange?

No, we are not going to do this.

&gt; Has Bloom realized yet that ad spends, fancy social content, and livestreams do not equate to a successful protocol?

Bloom is an engineering lead company. As a protocol, it‚Äôs important that the community is kept up to speed on our advancements.

We aren‚Äôt creating content or running ads in a black box. We test, measure and optimize everything towards a set of KPIs. Efficient user growth and strong partnerships will be key to our success.

&gt; How large is the team of full time workers?

We have about 20 employees. You can review them on our team page here: https://bloom.co/about

&gt; How much of the initial $40m is remaining?

We‚Äôve been incredibly conservative with spending. We have many years of runway.

Closing thoughts:

Our developer ecosystem is live and growing. We have dozens of partnerships. We are working with major financial institutions and lenders.

We‚Äôre creating product with UX that will bring decentralized applications mainstream. We consistently publish updates on this work. Companies are not built overnight, and we are well ahead of pace. (edited)",1533081631

&gt; CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta was loudly heckled by supporters of President Donald Trump at presidential rally in Tampa Bay on Tuesday.

&gt; As Acosta - a sharp questioner of the president and a frequent target of his ire - reported live from the event, a crowd of rally attendees surrounding him chanted &amp;quot;CNN sucks&amp;quot; and shouted, &amp;quot;Traitor,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;You&amp;#039;re a liar.""

&gt; Acosta, who frequently butts heads with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders during press briefings, was similarly heckled by Trump supporters at a June rally, where he was both yelled at and asked for autographs.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","Yup. Sort of alluded to that on the other branch:

On paper, a 40 hour battery life sounds amazing. Let's consider the two use cases:

1. You are a hardcore gamer. You play for 10 hours at a time and you recharge your controller between every single session. You only ever discharge it \~75% and that tends to cause long-ish term issues with batteries. You don't want to fully discharge every time, but you do want to work the battery a bit. And then realize sessions tend to be a lot shorter than 10 hours...
2. You are like me and can't be bothered to walk to the console/charger. You play until your controller dies then recharge it. The pro controller has a 6 hour charging time. That is a strong incentive to encourage people to buy a second controller so that ""this never happens again"".

As much shit as I love to give Sony for their horrible battery life and unnecessarily draining light bar, that is actually a more consumer friendly design... somehow. The short battery life makes you more likely to periodically drain the controller. And because of that you're more likely to recharge it regularly when it is at 25-75%, giving the battery the workout it needs for long term use.

Going to be interesting in ten years. I suspect Sony will be in the N64-esque ""the controller is great but the stick is a broken piece of shit"" (because god those analog sticks are cheap) territory. And I suspect most pro controllers will only work if they are plugged in due to fucked batteries.

And everyone will be dealing with dead xbone controllers after they left the batteries in there for 10 years...",1533081633

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'd like to offer a different way of looking at what you describe. 

What I see is not that I am wealthy, its is that a huge chunk of Americans are increasingly poor, and that the ultra wealthy, those with political power, those that truly benefit from the political and legal system don't want you think you are poor. 

When I look at the life we are living, I see us doing the things that my grandparents did with 1 working class salary. 

I will have enough money for my kids to goto college. To live in an area with good schools, to be available when they need us, to provide healthcare for them, to retire. 

So that when they are young adults, they have the advantages and opportunity to do the same. 

I'm not building an empire, or living lavishly. Yes we could get by on less, but what am I going to do? Go into my boss and ask for 50% pay cut? 

The next step above us in wealth, the people earning say 750k or more a year, (doctors, partners at law firms, small business owners, execs at large companies) start to have the opportunity to do some multi-generational wealth building. But again, I don't blame those people for our problems. 

I blame our government for robbing from the most needy in the US thru lack of proper support to give to the ultra wealthy. 

Look Trump tax cuts will save me about 8k this year, big damn deal, what am I going to do with that? Nothing that will change my life. 

But if I earn 150M this year, that tax savings is in the 10s of millions. That's a huge raw sum of money. A single year's tax savings could fund a trust that will provide a livable annual wage for several people for a couple of generations. ",1533081633

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;How is causation determined in these studies? How was it determined that secondary smoke was the main cause for all these deaths and not only a single contributing factor? And how often and for how long were enrolees exposed to secondary cigarette smoke?

It's in the studies I linked you:

&gt;between 1981 and 1989 the German centre did at least 115 studies of sidestream smoke. The centre's research showed that sidestream condensate caused two to six times more tumours per gram than mainstream condensate. The research also showed that inhaled fresh sidestream cigarette smoke is about four times more toxic per gram of total particulate matter than mainstream cigarette smoke.

The tests were toxicology tests done in a lab. 

If you're talking about the deaths by second hand smoke, I don't have that information handy but I can still address your point. I agree that it's not binary, there are always other factors. However, here are a few points to consider:

1. Any sound experiment controls for variables. That's literally how you have to build the experiment for it to count. Smoking is not a new area of research, it's been studied countless times over decades. I find it difficult to believe nobody has asked the question you're asking and that it hasn't been addressed already - the tobacco industry literally spends billions lobbying.

2. A toxicology report is sufficient to determine something is toxic and it also determines that secondary smoke is 4 times more toxic than primary. That's enough to say you shouldn't be breathing in secondary smoke if it's avoidable.

&gt; I just find it odd that diesel fumes for example aren‚Äôt being attributed despite the fact that it‚Äôs THE leading contributor to cancer from air pollution, magnitudes more harmful than secondary smoke.

There are in fact studies on it. The US average of air pollution is the equivalent of 0.4 cigarettes a day. 

http://berkeleyearth.org/air-pollution-and-cigarette-equivalence/

&gt;I get the feeling smoking is being made a scapegoat in these studies because it‚Äôs the easiest contributor to target due to social outrage.

This is also untrue. It's targeted because it's been shown to directly cause negative health effects AND it's a non-essential product. Yes, pesticides and exhaust fumes are bad - but what are you going to do about it? Removing either immediately would destroy the economy and peoples' lives. Many of these are addressed by other initiatives like electric vehicles and clean energy.

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Use 3 Cywir and 2 Ilujankan components for guaranteed pf as1.

* I use shadow glaive and virtus wand for switches and they're pretty cheap. Components and weapons all in was like 40m I think, maybe a bit more. Pf is dope for Magister as he basically becomes one Sunshine rotation.

* You can get a cheap flanking switch and it won't matter too much. Get an upgraded seasinger orb or something rather than splashing out on seismic/praesul.

* Ascensions are absolutely better than Nox bow. Needle strike is great and bak bolts are too. Your order should be ruby &gt; dragonstone &gt; diamond. Only use ruby if they have more than ~40k lp, and then use diamond if dragonstone doesn't work. Can take more bak switches for binds or onslaught etc but that's the basics. Some people will say the range is important at nex or whatever but meh. Only time I've used it is nex speed kills so I can tag minion and nex without moving from my death swift.

It sucks to be punished and not being told what you did wrong and what can you do to fix whatever is causing it. 

I also think that if having multiple accounts has a significant impact on the TF it is probably impacting a lot of innocent players. Valve has basically forced people to buy new accounts to play with their lower ranked friends, id say a large part of CSGO player has 1 or 2 'smurf' accounts. Sure people could say just join a random lobby to get the 5 people needed but its harder than you might think and takes more time which is annoying if you just want a quick game with a friend without having to take 10min to find a lobby that will accept you.

Commit to buy 720 capsules over 18 months and the machine is free. Illy also runs a special promo two times a year where you buy $250 in capsules and you get a free machine. Free. 

Illy‚Äôs espresso is superior to anything Nespresso makes. No third party suppliers. Mail order only. Small variety, changes annually, but only about 10 espresso selections. Some of the machines also brew illy‚Äôs filter coffee capsule, a full 8 ounces. Killer stuff.

[Let's take a look:](https://themoscowproject.org/explainers/trumps-russia-cover-up-by-the-numbers-70-contacts-with-russia-linked-operatives/)

&gt; July 24, 2016:¬†Paul Manafort appeared on ABC‚Äôs This Week and George Stephanopoulos asked him ‚ÄúAre there any ties between Mr. Trump, you or your campaign and Putin and his regime?‚Äù To which Manafort responded, ‚ÄúNo, there are not. That‚Äôs absurd. And you know, there‚Äôs no basis to it.‚Äù

&gt; July 24, 2016: Donald Trump Jr. appeared on CNN and told Jake Tapper that the Clinton campaign‚Äôs suggestion that Russia was helping Trump was ‚Äúdisgusting‚Äù and ‚Äúphony,‚Äù noting, ‚ÄúWell, it just goes to show you their exact moral compass. I mean, they will say anything to be able to win this. I mean, this is time and time again, lie after lie.‚Äù

&gt;&gt; (July 16, 2018: The Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked, ‚ÄúPresident Putin, did you want President Trump to win the election and did you direct any of your officials to help him do that?‚Äù But how exactly did Vladimir Putin respond to those pointed questions? If you listen to the English translation that was broadcast during the press conference, the Russian leader said, [‚ÄúYes, I did. Yes, I did.""](https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.theatlantic.com/amp/article/565481/))

&gt; July 27, 2016:¬†Trump appeared on a CBS Miami news station and, in response to allegations that Russia was trying to help him win the election, told Jim DeFed, ‚ÄúI can tell you I think if I came up with that they‚Äôd say, ‚ÄòOh, it‚Äôs a conspiracy theory, it‚Äôs ridiculous‚Äô ‚Ä¶ I mean I have nothing to do with Russia. I don‚Äôt have any jobs in Russia. I‚Äôm all over the world but we‚Äôre not involved in Russia.‚Äù

&gt; October 24, 2016:¬†At a rally in Tampa, Florida, Trump stated he has ‚Äúnothing to do with Russia, folks. I‚Äôll give you a written statement.‚Äù

&gt; November 11, 2016:¬†Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks gave the Associated Press a blanket denial of Trump campaign contacts with Russia, stating, ‚ÄúIt never happened. There was no communication between the campaign and any foreign entity during the campaign.‚Äù

&gt; December 18, 2016:¬†Kellyanne Conway went on ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù and John Dickerson asked her, ‚ÄúDid anyone involved ‚Ä¶ in the Trump campaign have any contact with Russians trying to meddle with the election?‚Äù Conway responded, ‚ÄúAbsolutely not. And I discussed that with the president-elect just last night. Those conversations never happened. I hear people saying it like it‚Äôs a fact on television. That is just not only inaccurate and false, but it‚Äôs dangerous.‚Äù

&gt; January 10, 2017:¬†At a hearing for Jeff Sessions‚Äô nomination for the position of attorney general, Senator Al Franken asked him what he would do if there was evidence ‚Äúthat anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course of this campaign.‚Äù Sessions replied, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians, and I‚Äôm unable to comment on it.‚Äù

&gt; January 15, 2017:¬†Vice President-elect Mike Pence went on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday,‚Äùand Chris Wallace asked him, ‚ÄúSo, I‚Äôm asking a direct question: was there any contact in any way between Trump or his associates and the Kremlin or cutouts they had?‚Äù Pence replied, ‚ÄúOf course not. Why would there be any contacts between the campaign?

&gt; ¬†January 15, 2017:¬†That same day, Pence also went on ‚ÄúFace the Nation,‚Äù where John Dickerson asked him, ‚ÄúJust to button up one question, did any advisor or anybody in the Trump campaign have any contact with the Russians who were trying to meddle in the election?‚Äù Pence replied, ‚ÄúOf course not. And I think to suggest that is to give credence to some of these bizarre rumors that have swirled around the candidacy.‚Äù

&gt; February 16, 2017:¬†Trump held a press conference and told reporters, ‚ÄúRussia is a ruse. I know you have to get up and ask a question. It‚Äôs so important. Russia is a ruse. I have nothing to do with Russia. Haven‚Äôt made a phone call to Russia in years. Don‚Äôt speak to people from Russia. Not that I wouldn‚Äôt. I just have nobody to speak to. I spoke to Putin twice. He called me on the election. I told you this. And he called me on the inauguration, a few days ago. We had a very good talk, especially the second one, lasted for a pretty long period of time. I‚Äôm sure you probably get it because it was classified. So I‚Äôm sure everybody in this room perhaps has it. But we had a very, very good talk. I have nothing to do with Russia. To the best of my knowledge no person that I deal with does.‚Äù

&gt; ¬†February 19, 2017:¬†White House Chief of Staff Reince Preibus went on ‚ÄúFox News Sunday,‚Äù and when Chris Wallace asked whether the Trump team had any connections to Russia, Preibus said ‚Äúno.‚Äù Preibus later went on to add, ‚ÄúLet me give you an example. First of all, The New York Times put out an article with no direct sources that said that the Trump campaign had constant contacts with Russian spies, basically, you know, some treasonous type of accusations. We have now all kinds of people looking into this. I can assure you and I have been approved to say this‚Äîthat the top levels of the intelligence community have assured me that that story is not only inaccurate, but it‚Äôs grossly overstated and it was wrong. And there‚Äôs nothing to it.‚Äù

&gt; February 20, 2017:¬†White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders denied contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, stating, ‚ÄúThis is a nonstory because to the best of our knowledge, no contacts took place, so it‚Äôs hard to make a comment on something that never happened.‚Äù

&gt; February 24, 2017:¬†At a White House press briefing, Sean Spicer was asked whether ‚Äúthe President has an improper relationship with Russia‚Äù and responded, ‚ÄúHe has no interests in Russia. He has no‚Äîthere‚Äôs only so many times he can deny something that doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

&gt; May 11, 2017:¬†In an interview with NBC, Trump told Lester Holt, ‚ÄúI have had dealings over the years where I sold a house to a very wealthy Russian many years ago. I had the Miss Universe pageant‚Äîwhich I owned for quite a while‚ÄîI had it in Moscow a long time ago. But other than that I have nothing to do with Russia.‚Äù Later in the interview, when discussing Comey‚Äôs firing, Trump stated, ‚ÄúAnd in fact, when I decided to just do it, I said to myself‚ÄîI said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It‚Äôs an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election they should‚Äôve won.‚Äù

&gt; May 18, 2017:¬†At a press conference in May 2017, Trump repeatedly denied any collusion occurred between his campaign and Russia, at one point stating, ‚Äú[T] he entire thing has been a witch hunt. And there is no collusion between, certainly, myself and my campaign, but I can only speak for myself and the Russians‚Äîzero.

So yeah, there was a lot. 

&gt; Contrary to popular US belief, not every news out of the US is ""worldnews"", heck the first thing on this sub is literally:

&gt;&gt; Welcome! /r/worldnews is for major news from around the world except US-internal news / US politics

US-internal and US-external are two different things. Since this is an international issue, I don't really see the problem here. 

Also I'm not sure how you can be so upset about it not being ""worldnews"" or that it's too ""USA-centric"" when you said the words Putin and Russia five times in your post.

When I was on argument mode, it was compounding things. Then I changed my stance. I Initially went no contact.
She later got in touch with me (3 weeks later), her behaviour improved. And I improved as well.

Now I have been a good &amp; caring friend for her since she broke NC. It will be until at least she gets her stuff back (she is in a different country). Then I have to break off completely for her and my sake. 

Meanwhile, in the last week. She has opened up &amp; told me straight off that she does not have feelings for her fianc√© (he &amp; his family got them together almost by force/begging). And that they don't talk much, and all she wants is peace from him. Not only that, but he hasn't improved much as he promised (he used to be abusive &amp; controlling). 

Also in the last few days, she mentioned that she misses me a lot and that I have the been best guy ever to her.

Now my love for her is still strong. I think she feels the same, but hasn't really admitted because of guilt. 

That's why I want to go for it now.. Before I lose her forever. ",1533081639

Every day when you wake up take a link off counting backwards (so start with taking off link #147). You can even write something on each link so that every day you read something inspiring.

Basically, instead of white, we get that subdued color pallette, with hints of Neon.  The icons themselves have Depth, imagine a new Edge, Firefox, Chrome icons designed in that same vein.  

I think a capital E for edge looking like steps, would be a better icons.  

The Tiles should be Acrylic with settings that can make the tiles disappear, or change opaqueness levels, or fade out effects.  And what remains is Fluent icons with Depth, and Haptic feedback, so they look like objects popping out if screen.  

MS could do amazing things, damn CShell is taking too long.  

If you look at those chairs, they're basically icons....

"politics","t5_2cneq","I ashamedly admit I was a Libertarian in the 90's and early 2000's. There was always a fringe element that was racist, self-serving, and only joined because of their extreme views on gun liberties (aka survivalists and militias.) You would see tiny bits of this through the Lew Rockwell publications - the racism and the nuttiness. But that wasn't the majority.

It wasn't really until the Tea Parties that you saw a shift from Ron Paul to the fringe GOP that took over. The Glenn Becks, the Dick Armies, the Michelle Bachmann's and Sarah Palin of all fucking people.  It went from a Jeffersonian liberty-to-all to a swamp of the worst kinds of conservative whackos - the ones who only wanted freedoms for themselves, the freedom to hate others, the freedom to attack other countries at whim, the freedom to be xenophobic, the freedom to own guns and use them on anyone they didn't like.  Liberarian Party went from idealists to scumbags almost in a blink of an eye.

The word Libertarian is now a dirty word, as it should be. Even the ideals are flawed.. you can't have a society that exists without basic social services. That is, unless you prefer to live in Somalia. A country without essential life services and social programs (fire dept, police, military, healthcare, highways, water sewage, regulations) is a completely shit country.

&gt; Federal prosecutors say that those transactions paint a detailed picture of how the woman, Maria Butina, and GOP operative Paul Erickson funded an alleged campaign to influence American politics.

&gt; Wells Fargo&amp;#039;s anti-money laundering division began looking into the duo&amp;#039;s transactions in early 2017 after receiving a referral from the FBI. In reports to the FBI and the Treasury Department&amp;#039;s financial crimes division, bank officials expressed concern about how much control Erickson appeared to have over Butina&amp;#039;s personal checking account, BuzzFeed reported.

&gt; Among the transactions flagged as suspicious were tens of thousands of dollars transferred between Erickson&amp;#039;s accounts in the U.S. and an account belonging to Butina in Russia.

2 lb Spaghetti Noodles (Or other similar preferred noodle)

2 lb Ground Beef

Any taco condiments of your choosing. (Sour cream, Cheese, Salsa, Tomatoes, Gaucamole, etc)

Sauce Ingredients:

1 8oz Can of Tomato Sauce

2 - 8oz cans of El Pato Sauce

1 cube beef bullion

15oz water

Cook noodles, meat and sauce separately. 

While cooking meat, season with garlic powder, salt and pepper. (Optional) Drain grease from cooked meat.

Mix sauce ingredients in a small pot and mix until sauce is warm. Add sauce to the cooked meat once the meat is completed.

I do not recommend mixing sauce with noodles before serving. Serve noodles and meat separately. This usually makes reheating taste better imo.

After noodles and sauce are served, each person can add thier favorite taco ingredients to thier plate. If it goes good with a taco, it goes good with this.

You will never eat Spaghetti the same again. :)

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Yes. 

I was in the Army for 9 years and did a lot of combat camera stuff. Documenting war helps both sides. If someone were to commit war crimes, there is footage for the victims.  Its a PR tool as well as archival media that help portray ""realistic"" versions of the event as it unfolded. 

It also strips away the hyperreality that photos and videos create. War is NOT glorifying and honorable. Its being shot at in a scary fucking place by people youve never met for reasons you arent even involved in. Until you experience death and witness it, you remain in that hollywood bubble of 'everyone else dies but the hero/me.'  War is boredom filled with moments of sheer terror. Noone should suffer like those do because the scars these people take home are only partly physical. I am rated with PTSD and I doubt Ill ever live a truly normal life. 

We have holocaust deniers and narratives that might not be true to facts. I literally created over a hundred video pieces for various missions with the overarching message that we told the story of the US military positively. If my bosses wanted me to change something, I did.  Now imagine a group of people pushing the wrong version of events through manipulative video editing and narrative?  How do you disprove it?

What makes it evil?  Being a cog in the system. I was instructed to film and only shoot back if my life was in immediate danger. Being shot at and NOT shooting back is fucking infuriating and confusing. At the end of the day, you are a part of the machine that entertain and informs the other parts of the same machine.  You are propaganda in a military.

If you have any questions let me know. The Army has a few different jobs for media that I can answer.

"science","t5_mouw","&gt; (i.e., the pre-k educators had a higher false positive rate for special ed than kindergarten educators):

I wonder if age is the issue. We've seen before than the youngest kids in their year are more likely to be ""diagnosed"" by teachers with ADHD.  A year's difference in age has a bigger impact on ability and emotional maturity the younger a child is, or at least it seems like that would be case.  So a year's difference would theoretically make the youngest children in the the class seem ""more behind"" the eldest or mid in Pre-K than in kindergarten than in sixth grade.

Aside from that, though, we've previously seen studies indicating early education advantages wear off by fourth grade. Indeed, I think I saw one (a while ago) saying that by age 11, students starting at age 7 were ""caught up"" with those starting at 5.  [I think this article references a study of that sort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2015/10/07/delaying-kindergarten-until-age-7-offers-key-benefits-to-kids-study/?utm_term=.a9e96ac0cc69), though it acknowledges mixed results in previous studies.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I‚Äôve been in a very similar situation, but I chose to stay after I started having those feelings of wanting to end the relationship. I‚Äôm currently 29(f). I dated my ex for 9 1/2 years! We met our first semester of college, he was only a year older. We were happy (for the most part) for about 3.5 years. But the sex slowed down and eventually became nonexistent (I‚Äôm not joking when I say that we maybe had sex 2-3 times in the last 3-31/2 years together). It became clear that we were growing a part. 

I told him after our first year together that I couldn‚Äôt stay in (STATE we went to college in) and was going to be moving after we graduated. This is where he was born and raised, and his entire family lived within 3-4 hours of each other. But he told me the same thing your bf is saying to you: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll move anywhere with you. I love you.‚Äù While this is a sweet gesture, I‚Äôll be honest I was ALWAYS paranoid he wasn‚Äôt moving for himself (even though he said he wanted to, there were good job opportunities in his field). Then once that time came and we moved, I had already been experiencing these feelings of doubt for about a year. We got to  NEW CITY in NEW STATE and he became super clingy. We both didn‚Äôt know anyone, but he latched on, and when I did start to make friends he started to make me feel bad for wanting to spend time with them. He started to become possessive and controlling in ways. 

Every time I thought of ending things, I felt scared and guilty. He followed me out here, left his family for me. I‚Äôm in my late twenties now, I‚Äôve been with him for my entire adult life, almost a DECADE! I‚Äôd never been single for longer then a few months, what if I didn‚Äôt know how to be after sooo long with one guy?? But the guilt was the worst. The house we were in was all in my name, he‚Äôd be homeless if I ended it. Obviously your bf is in his thirties so he‚Äôs in a different mindset and place in life. 

But please don‚Äôt let your fear of these things drive you to settle for a relationship you already know isn‚Äôt right for you. Yes, things will be awkward and it‚Äôll hurt to cause him pain. But you owe him the truth. Your family is your family and will support your decision. Again I‚Äôm sure there will awkwardness since they will probably stay friendly with him. But how much they like him shouldn‚Äôt be one of your main deciding factors for whether or not this is a man you want to potentially spend your life with. I know this will sound cliche, but you‚Äôre still really young, and you owe it to yourself to be selfish for a little while and do exactly as you said- figure out who you are as an individual and as an independent adult. 

I wish I‚Äôd done this. My relationship exploded in my face when it finally ended and was wayyy worse then if I‚Äôd just been honest.

"confession","t5_2qo2a","I'm so sorry this happened, it's fucked up and such a shitty situation. Fellow survivor here. Thank you for sharing, and I hope you understand that there is not a ""normal"" reaction to trauma bc trauma is horrible and just all around abnormal. Sometimes people cry, laugh, don't want to be touched, want to be held, want to talk about it, don't talk about it for 50 years. There can be a wide range of reactions or emotions, and they are often conflicting. I started going to therapy 3 years ago for something unrelated, and I realized as I spoke with my therapist just how much of my worldview and expectations had been colored by my traumatic experiences. I would heavily recommend a therapist. A good therapist with whom you have a rapport can teach you the tools to help you recognize when you are starting to feel empty or overwhelmed like you mentioned in the first sentence, as well as the tools and practices to help yourself out of a low feeling. 

I also don't know if it's helpful, but I am a professional dominatrix, and a lot of people in the kink community are survivors of sexual trauma. BDSM is an outlet for sexual expression that, in a femdom role, I find incredibly empowering. When you're ready, if it's something you're interested in, I would check out a femdom class (or a martial arts class, boxing class, or a Self Defense class) to help you practice getting into the role of The Powerful Person You Are. I know this is a stretch and I'm not necessarily suggesting it, but there is a type of sexual scene called ""consensual non-consent"" that enacts a rape-scene; I don't recommend trying it out if you are concerned it might trigger you, but I do know a few survivors who seek out this type of activity from a VERY trusted partner as a way to be in control of satisfying the cravings you describe in a safe and healthy way. If you'd like to talk more, please DM me. Hugs.

&gt;About 170 dogs and monkeys were rescued in 2010 from an abandoned pharmaceutical testing lab owned by Shri Thanedar, a Michigan Democratic gubernatorial candidate currently leading in the polls.

&gt;Thanedar had to shutter the New Jersey testing facility, AniClin Preclinical Services, after its parent company, Azopharma, which he owned, went bankrupt in April 2010.

&gt;Local animal rights activists learned in June of that year that 118 beagles were still stuck inside the facility. The lab‚Äôs workers had been jumping the lab‚Äôs fences to provide food and water for the dogs, according to a USA Today report.

My exgf jumped up off the bed and started hitting me over the head while demanding to know the name of the whore I was with (her words).

While fending her off I managed to call the building lobby and asked security to come up to my room.

When the 4 foot tall security guard arrived he decided he didn't want to get involved either, so I grabbed my exgf by the arm and walked her back to the elevator. The security guard got in with her and I retreated back to my room. I should mention she lived in the floor above mine.

I thought things probably weren't going to work out with my new gf so I ended up hooking up with somebody else. A couple of nights later we were in bed when we were woken up at 11pm by someone pounding on the door.

Looking through the peephole I could see my exgf standing there with 2 very stern faced policemen. I opened the door and they told me my exgf was accusing me of beating her. I told them everything that had happened. It probably helped that my new, new gf was with me when they visited.

After speaking with me for a couple of minutes they came to the assumption that my exgf was batshit crazy and a liar, and they left.

The very next day I got a call from some doctor who told me ""I have *name* here and she is saying you have been hitting her"". I told the doctor that was ridiculous and gave her the same reply I had given to the police. 

That afternoon my phone started blowing up with calls from my ex. About 150 missed calls later I finally answered to tell her to fuck off. She was in tears and claimed she was going to kill herself.

I wearily said something like ""ok good luck"" and hung up the phone. I went downstairs to get some beer then returned to my room and sat out on the balcony drinking and wondering how I could escape this mess when I heard a siren getting closer and closer. 

I thought ""surely not"" but my worse fears were realised when I saw them park at my building. Less than 5 minutes later they wheeled her out on a stretcher and both her and the ambulance disappeared.

Following that I didn't hear from her ever again. From what people told me, she had drunk something that made her sick but wouldn't have killed her, and called the ambulance and told them to pick up her lifeless body.

I also found out that she was moonlighting as a hooker and travelled to singapore often to work. She had told me she worked in a hotel but by the time all of this had happened I was beginning to have my doubts about her story anyway.

And that's the tale of how I wound up dating a hooker who tried to get me stitched up on false domestic violence charges.",1533081650

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","\&gt; Moving the goalposts is an [informal fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_fallacy) in which evidence presented in response to a specific claim is dismissed and some other (often greater) evidence is demanded. That is, after an attempt has been made to score a goal, the goalposts are moved to exclude the attempt.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts#cite_note-clark-3) The problem with changing the rules of the game is that the meaning of the result is changed, too 

I have not once moved the goalpost. My original statement that you argued against is the same as the statement you claimed I moved the goalpost in. Not to mention, your response to me was-

""I don't think you know bout poverty""

It's on you to first prove that my first statement was incorrect, I would then counter with moving the goalpost. However you have yet to discredit what I said , so it's not even possible for me to have moved the goalpost since you haven't made a counter point to me yet.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","Green Bay: Aaron Jones, Ty Montgomery, Jamaal Williams.

* **Not a committee.** I want Jones. Williams proved he could carry the load last year, but with Aaron Rodgers, that's not what this offense needs. Jones has the highest upside of these three and raises the potential of the Packers offense the most. Williams will get some carries in a backup role while Montgomery will be a chess piece/package player.

Seattle: Rashaad Penny, Chris Carson, CJ Prosise, JD McKissic, Mike Davis.

* **Who in the world knows.** Either way, I'm staying away from everybody in this group. Carson and Penny's ADPs will drift towards each other, making Penny more enticing, but I'm not biting. The Seahawks have not been able to run the ball consistently since Marshawn left and did nothing to address their offensive line concerns. In addition, I expect their defense to be significantly worse, so Russell may have to air-it-out in catch-up mode more often. 

Cleveland: Carlos Hyde, Duke Johnson, Nick Chubb.

* **Committee.** The only one here with a defined role is Johnson, so I'm willing to take him in PPR leagues. Hyde and Chubb are both talented players so I expect a near 50-50 split. The offense is good on paper, but they're also the Browns so....  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 

New England: Rex Burkhead, Sony Michel, James White.

* **Committee.** Belichek will play the matchups so even if one of these guys starts off strong, it's no clear sign they've won the job. Like in Cleveland, White has the PPR role so I'm comfortable with him there, but I'm avoiding the other two in standard leagues. Burkhead is a sneaky best-ball pick since he'll probably get consistent looks at touchdowns. 

Indy: Marlon Mack, Nyheim Hines.

* **Not a Committee.** Mack will emerge as the back to own here. He [profiles](https://www.playerprofiler.com/nfl/marlon-mack/) athletically as more of a lead-back compared to Hines who is a 5'9"" 198 pass-catching specialist. Turbin has been a short-yardage, goal-line vulture his whole career. Wilkins is there, but he's not better than Mack.

Oakland: Marshawn Lynch, Doug Martin.

* **Committee.** Lynch played well down the stretch last season, but the Raiders will want to take as much of the load off of him as possible. They probably believe they are playoff-bound, and they want Beast Mode to be healthy then. Martin had his best seasons in zone-blocking schemes similar to what Oakland will run this year. Add in pass-catchers like Jalen Richard and DeAndre Washington and you've got yourself a committee. 

Miami: Kenyon Drake, Frank Gore.

* **Not a Committee.** While the Dolphins brought in Gore, I wonder how much of that was about his veteran leadership. He's probably still an above average back at this point, but Adam Gase spoke all summer about adding leaders in the locker room. Drake proved he could shoulder the load at the end of last season and with Jarvis Landry gone is the most talented player the Dolphins have on offense. The offense should revolve around him.

New York Jets: Isiah Crowell, Bilal Powell.

* **Committee.** Yuck. This is a recipe for disaster. Three backs (Elijah McGuire) who are all probably similarly talented and don't directly complement each other are vying for touches on a team with a crappy o-line that's going to have a bottom-10 offense and at some point will probably trot out a rookie quarterback. Hard pass. ",1533081651

"badwomensanatomy","t5_2zlzd","I'm trans and I had a lot of trouble coming to terms with it because I had the same conception of transexuality that you have, I kept thinking that what I felt made no sense because ""I can still be a woman and do so-called masculine stuff and I'm not even the most masculine girl in my social group"", I think what you are missing is the dysphoria part, when a trans person says their body doesn't feel right they mean it in a literal physical sense and if you have never felt dysphoria then it's extremely difficult to imagine how it feels, I'm post op now but before I was in constantly hyper-awareness of my feminine characteristics, it felt like something was extremely wrong in my body and I needed to fix it ASAP, I had this urges to practically rip my breasts out of my body and it gave me so much anxiety, it depends on the person but in my case wearing a binder was little comfort, I did feel better but it still felt like I was feigning the problem didn't exist, I knew my breasts were there even if they weren't noticeable through my clothes, any kind of sexual activity, even masturbating was so uncomfortable and disorienting I couldn't even enjoy orgasms, and I could go on and on. 

Everybody is different, if you google dysphoria there are lots of people talking about their experiences that could make the difference between a gender non-conforming person and a trans person, being trans is and isn't about society, gender is an extremely social thing and of course feeling detached of your sex in turn takes a social aspect too but it doesn't start there, is not about what other people see or think or what society tells you should be, is about how you feel inside, right now that my body is finally aligned with what my brain or whatever felt was right I get how it feels to ""not feel a gender"", I don't go through life now consumed about my new genitals or beard, this are just things that are as they should be and therefore don't deserve any thought, I didn't have that luxury before.",1533081653

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","Earthgore is the main heal monster set atm, with an absolutely monsterous heal proc and removal of an enemy AoE. The downside is the long proc time and the stationary nature of the heal. Chokethorn is good for fights where you need an extra heal on a single moving target, and does really well in dungeons. Nightflame is another good area heal for dungeons, with a faster proc than Earthgore.  
  
I use SPC for dungeons, Olorime for trials. Olorime requires people to be in your AoE for it to be effective, and in a lot of dungeons there is more moving around than in trials, so SPC usually gets the edge over Olorime in dungeons.  
  
Pair that with any set you feel is useful for the specific dungeon - Mending, Jorvulds, Worm, Sanctuary. You'll get a feel for what set is better where. If in doubt, you can never go wrong with SPC/Mending or SPC/Worm.

&gt;Sounds like something Antifa says after they no-platform someone, justifying their shutting down of an event lol, literally almost 1:1.

Where was the ""violation"" of tone in that sentence?

&gt;""freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences""

There was the phrase that I see crop up time and time again when used to justify censorship, to prove my above point that the phrasing was almost 1:1 the exact same.


&gt;the privilege of ""saying anything I want"" comes with the ""I'm responsible for the shit I say"" burden.

&gt;""freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences""

&gt;it does violate R1, R1.3 specifically.

&gt;Divide &amp; Conquer

&gt;Posts and comments designed to drive a wedge in the community, especially (but not limited to) excessive attacks against other users which are clearly based in identity politics.
You're actually uniroincally serious right now, aren't you?

You're actually being serious right now, aren't you? The only wedge here, is you attempting to enforce a rule arbitrarily because you for whatever reason now feel that I'm not allowed to disagree with somebodies reasoning. So what, we're going to start banning people because they disagree with others now? I've been here for fucking 4 years, you're telling me it's now, and only now that I can't argue a point, because of some strange ""obfuscation"" in a sentence that is literally 21 words long? 

You want divide and conquer, how about you start banning people who are clearly here from other subs that are wildly against what this sub is, trying to sow division, like a handful of users in the past week that I've been reporting who are here simply trying to wind others up. Don't see any warnings or bans for those yet, despite a clear violation, but I make one fucking comment that disagrees and all of a sudden *I'm* dividing and conquering? 

This is after /u/Hlavne_neplakej outright said:

&gt;Grow up and take responsibility for your life.

Is that not a Rule 1 violation? Where do I see your comment telling them to not go around being a ""dickwolf""? Instead it's a shitty off-comment about me noticing a similarity in reasoning between that user, and some people that find excuses to shut others down, and hilariously enough, here you fucking come along trying to shut down my opinion because the ""tone"" is all wrong.",1533081655

Right. It's important to Christians too.

&gt; They're seen as legendary - not historical - figures. Think King Arthur.

Right, and I do actually reject that view. I see no good reason to think they *never* existed. Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, especially from 3000+ years ago.

&gt; I have my own conclusions but my specific question presume Exodus was dogma (per your comment) and I was wondering if that claim was successfully challenged.

That's interesting. Something is dogma only if it's been overturned? What does ""successfully challenged"" mean? Is Jesus' existence ""dogma""?

If bad actions don't really have good outcomes, then what are those counterfactuals you are speaking of? A good action that has bad consequences? I would ask for examples, but I don't see why that would turn out differently than my original question did.

Maybe as you get older and sex/physical beauty will be less important but for now it matters to you and that's ok. You deserve to be happy and whether or not I feel you are being shallow is irrelevant. I don't want you to think I think badly of you, that was just my first instinct and I felt the need to share it. 
Things happen when you're in a relationship. People change physically and otherwise. It's important to put things into perspective sometimes. If you had a wife that lost her hair and looks because of cancer/chemo would you feel resentful and want to trade her in for someone prettier/healthier? How would you feel if you found out your partner felt that way if you were to lose your looks/health? It's important that you not only ask yourself questions like that but that you know the answer. Being completely honest with yourself is key. If you know that you'll never come around to being attracted to this girl again then you should end things now. It seems like this is a set up that will end in you resenting her for not changing and her resenting you for wanting her to change. But you can't change people. You either have to swallow them whole or leave them alone. ",1533081657

If you don't, and it later turns out there was a conflict of interest then your work will be totally rubbished and dismissed. There's a reason for that, and that reason is dodgy 'research' paid for by business to say what they want it to say. It would be interesting to see who they get to peer review their work.

I doubt anyone actually believes these 'think tanks' are legitimate or carry out real research, certainly not anymore.

In the world of (anarchist and otherwise) activism, people who do direct actions use the word ""activist"" to refer (positively) to other people who do direct actions.  I understand the distinction b/w appeals to authority and ground-up organizing but ""activism"" refers to the latter as well.

The people participating in imperfectly theorized DSA political work will learn and grow more as political actors than the people who stay at home and criticize them on the net.

And from what I understand, even if you do catch it early, it's still high odds that you'll need medical attention.  And those odds just keep going up the longer you wait. 

One thing that I didn't mention in any of my posts because honestly, I didn't think the cause, or if it is/isn't an abscess would be discussed is, these misses weren't just H misses....each shot also included a healthy sized meth dose also.

Pretty straightforward question here: Best paid or free online program to learn Python for Data Science/analytics?

"WindowsMR","t5_3k7hg","&gt; Although by the Rift, I mean a proper 360 setup, if you're going to be stuck with the default Oculus front facing setup, then don't even consider it.

So I will add here that I actually use my Rift for Roomscale using just two sensors, placed directly opposite each other on my play area.  Of course the play space isn't as large as the Vive.  But I've had no real tracking issues with just two sensors.  You don't *need* 3 sensors to do roomscale with Rift, if you plan right.

&gt; Of course, if maximum portability is the key then WMR is really the only option.

This is why I went with WMR headsets as I have. As I do VR demos at conventions, the Vive and Rift don't offer idea setup options for those spaces.  (Not when you're an indie dev stuck with a standard booth and no real floor space.)  The fact that I don't need external sensors/lighthouses means I can adjust to the space I have and offer multiple stations for demos.

In addition, you can get them *cheap*.  I just picked up an Acer WMR headst refurbished for $135, on sale from Acer directly.  Two of the other WMRs (one HP and one Lenovo) were ~$200 on Amazon.  At those prices even if something breaks it not the end of things.  Hell I can buy two for the price of a Rift or three for the price of a Vive.",1533081661

There is no incentive for managers to integrate younger players, while there's no real incentive for younger players to join knowing they'll likely end up plying their trade out on loan.  Unless these players are grass roots level, players between that 18-22 age bracket (give or take) are going to find chances of breaking into the first team being rare.

That supervisor will suggest to drive the injured person to the emergency room. Generally it's company policy that there is a specific clinic they'll go to for minor emergencies. 

Amazon may be big enough that they have their own minor emergency clinic with a staff doctor for case management. They'll treat the employee using specific methods to avoid classifying the injury as a recordable or a lost time injury. This is not to say the care is inferior, they attempt to navigate osha regulations to avoid performing procedures that OSHA automatically considers a serious procedure. For example if an employee has something stuck in their eye using an eye washing/flushing kit is OK but not using any tool to remove the foreign object. 

It's all about insurance. Companies don't want recordables or lost time injuries because they become more expensive to insure the following year. It also takes quite a lot of time for that record to drop before insurance rates can come back down.",1533081665

"talesfromtechsupport","t5_2sfg5","Yep. I do $5 power button to wall outlet diagnostics for my PC assembly/repair business. In short, that means I check the computer head to toe and make a list of what needs to be fixed, what should be fixed, and what I recommend gets done with pricing on each repair, that of which they can choose to buy from me or completely do everything from that point on themselves. Anyway...

I get a Snapchat message from my old roommate (who also worked with me for a while). He asks if I'm still doing my business and I say yes, so he sends an old friend of his who he didn't want to deal with my way. I tell him if he comes to my house I'll wave the arrival fee, another $5. So right now, I'm going to be looking at his PC to figure out what's wrong with it for $5 even. No biggie. He shows up to my house, drunk, with a guy from MY highschool I've also been avoiding for YEARS, also drunk. More drunk. He's absolutely insane, stories to come.

I'm floored. He brought this crazy dude to my HOUSE, they drunk drove what turned out to be AN HOUR AND A HALF to get to my house. They hop out, and the crazy guy is yelling about how he's the plug and is selling pounds (I know for a fact this is not true) and I remind him I have neighbors, but still dap that man up and welcome both of them into my home. The first words out of crazy dude's mouth are ""TEE-HEE-HEE CAN I TAKE A SHIT IN YO TOILET?! HUHUHUH"" and he does. Then he walks around my house farting pretending he's checking it out, even though he is farting AUDIBLY and we were both following him reminding him how weird he was being.


So he finally pulls his damn PC out, and it's in *tatters.* He built it himself, he screwed the motherboard into his actual case, and just much more I can't even describe without doubling this comment size. Anyway, it took me five minutes to point out what was wrong and I recommended a rebuild, then gave him a part list at his budget level. Everything is cool and we sit around for a bit talking, but in the meantime the crazy dude is touching EVERYTHING on my desk, chipped part of it off, dug through my weed and tried to smoke it even though he gets drug tested, so he loaded a big bowl, hit all of it into the bong, and didn't inhale a single particle. It was a MILKY hit too, I was pissed. It was in my nice, expensive bong too. Then, he takes the bong by the bottom, it's stand, and tries shoving it up to his friends mouth. I had to tell him THATS ENOUGH for him to finally fucking stop. It went on for a solid minute, which doesn't sound long but it felt like forever. Then, the guy said ""can you put it on my tab?""

The CT techs will be like ""see that slight discoloration right there? Thats a head bleed!"" and Im like "".....what? Where?"".

Edit: I should add in, when we bring people to CT scan to rule out a head bleed or a hemorrhagic stroke, if the technician finds something on the scan, we dont wait for the radiologist to give the report before we intervene.

2nd edit: I remember one kid came in with some abnormal scans that the technician noticed. She didnt tell the patient because she didnt know exactly what it was (not that she wouldve if she did). The patient was diagnosed with MS, I think he was 19 at the time.",1533081668

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","This is what I‚Äôll tell you. If you like the projects that you‚Äôre in, and you know the reasons why you‚Äôre invested in them, then you should definitely keep them, or some of them. 

I‚Äôm huge on XRP, but it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm right. I‚Äôm diversified, but very bullish on XRP. Here are s few reasons why.

1) They‚Äôre really solving a real problem with cross border payments, and how expensive it is, and how long it takes, and how many errors are currently happening with the SWIFT system. About 50 Central Banks from around the world are working with Ripple, as they‚Äôre ready for an improved system, one that‚Äôs near instance, and has had zero errors to date. 

2) Ripple had around 100 financial institutions from around the globe working with them in the beginning of the year. In the first quarter they signed up another 20, and just announced in the second quarter report that they had their best quarter yet, but didn‚Äôt reveal the number of customers signed up. Either way, they are adding customers left and right at this point. 

3) They are a part of the Federal Reserves Faster Payments Task Force, and Ryan Zagone from Ripple was chosen to be a part of the Steering Committee, and they want to have the system in place by 2020. 

4) Ripple is also a part of the Better Than Cash Alliance which the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is basically backing, and they are launching Mojiloop, which will enable the very poor from Africa and elsewhere to be involved with banking from their phones. Ryan Zagone is heading up this project as well.

5) The IMF is head over heels about Ripple and XRP, and they are basically the bank that banks the world. Ryan Zagone and Chris Larsen are involved with the leadership team there as well. 

6) SBI Group from Japan, who owns 10.5% of Ripple, has started SBI VC exchange, and first did a pre-registration for about 20,000 people back in October last year, and has allowed them to start trading July 4th. Then they started allowing people from Japan to register and get verified so they could start trading as well, but they had so many registrations that they couldn‚Äôt keep up. They had to push the launch date back a bit, but they are said to have collectively about 23 million customers under their current businesses which can sign up for the exchange. The CEO has retweeted tweets saying XRP to $10 by end of year. 

7) DCEX exchange just announced they will exclusively use XRP as its base currency paired with 15 other coins. Not all, but most are the top coins. They are taking registrations for a few weeks, and then they will launch. They are a US exchange in San Fran. 

Seriously, if you wanted 50 reasons, I could write them out, but for the sake of this being way to long already, I think you‚Äôll need to do a little research on your own, verses just taking what anybody on here tells you. XRP will go up drastically at some point. When? Who knows for sure, but probably as you mentioned, during the next bull run, which very likely will be in Sept/Oct, or at the very least, in the next 12 months, as institutional players are setting up trading desk for crypto left and right. They‚Äôre just waiting for regulatory clarity, and the SEC to do their jobs. ",1533081669

"wow","t5_2qio8","I don't understand why people are so focused on sylvanas' motives. I disagree with you that this is something she would do. She has always from my perspective, been portrayed as a very patient and thoughtful character, that wouldn't just burn a tree out of a whim. 

But why the fuck is the Tauren still on the horde? They have always been very druidy, like the night elfs, what about the fucking pandaren? the orcs that actually cared about thralls visions? The trolls that are druids and shamans? 

And no, the whole thing about them doing what they are told and peer pressure and shit, it's just not fitting in this context. The horde has had several infights. I mean fuck, garrosh just fucked everything up, and he was the leader. Why the fuck is every SO PREPARED, to sacrifice their entire culture, beliefs and ways of life, because sylvanas wants to go to war. 

At this point the more peaceful, or at least the ones that care about honor, should have stepped up, or split apart from the horde. Or at the least those that are tired of war, because that is literally why the horde was formed. People wanted peace and unity. Not hate and order. 

I've had plans to play bfa with some friends, and i've been wanting to actually invest time and energy into playing the game.

That way people don't stop to talk too long because they want to get to the next thing, and it ensures you see everyone.  
  
Table visits are just kind of annoying to me because I always have to watch where the bride and groom are and make sure I'm not stuffing my face when they get to me because they'll have about 5 seconds to say hi to each person.

For me cold emailing and LinkedIn messaging never worked, but I think it does for other kids. What worked for me was texting ppl I did class projects w/ or did clubs with who graduated and went to MBB. They gave me a lot of inside info on their firms' specific recruiting for our school - who to talk to, what events are important, what to emphasize in resume, etc that a cold connection probably would never have given me.

If I didn't know anyone at a firm, I would go to an info session, talk to one or two people who seemed to have similar backgrounds, and ask for their email. Then I would email them later and ask for a phone call or coffee.",1533081671

I was given him at a goldfish show because he had swim baldder issues and the owner no longer wanted him. Once he got acclimated in his new home with me, he was upright and swimming around with no problems. 

He's had minor swim bladder issues twice in the past year, which I remedied with fasting and green peas. His diet consists of frozen brine shrimp, blood worms, and new life spectrum thera+. 

About two weeks ago he started to pinecone. I immediately treated him with Epsom salt, fasting, and shelled green peas. My water parameters are pristine and he's currently in a 5 g bucket (with an air filter) that gets swapped out with clean water and 2 tsp of Epsom salt twice a day. I've also treated him with the maximum dose of Kanaplex (3 days of single doses) once I noticed that the fasting, peas, and Epsom salt weren't helping.

He's had a small bowel movement from the green peas, but it didn't look like much. I'm worried he has a blockage.

Despite pineconing, he's swimming around and alert as if nothing is wrong.

I would greatly appreciate any suggestions as I'm at a complete loss for what I can do to help him.",1533081672

But for real: Attempting to resurrect Tirion was pretty damn morally grey. He was one of the most powerful humans Azeroth has seen, one of the original paladins, extensive war experience. 

The attempt of his resurrection begged the question: How far are you supposed to go ""for the greater good""? If you give up everything you stand for to win a war, what is left of you after you win? But giving up nothing might end in certain defeat. What is the correct option, with the DK's and Paladins arguing the different sides.

Of course that wasn't explicitly said in game, but it made you think. Is what the DK's do now, evil? And because of that, it's a pretty good example of morally grey.

What Sylvanas does here has absolutely no redeeming factors. She has a reasoning that's clearly wrong, and her sense of right is clearly twisted. Nobody hears her reasoning and agrees with her.

In regards to reaching out to blogs - we will definitely be doing that! At the very least we will be partnering with a PR company. The reason for this is to fast-track the process of getting our music in front of the people who manage the publishing of content on print/online publications and other media outlets. My understanding is the people who work at these PR companies have connections with various media outlets. Part of the value is that that these PR companies have direct lines of communication with contacts at these media companies, so when they say ‚Äúhey check this band out‚Äù then it‚Äôs almost like a front-of-the-line phenomena. That‚Äôs why partnering with a legit PR company that has contacts at the media outlets that can market to your target audience is super crucial! 

A HUGE value add on behalf of the labels (IMO) is they are able to take on the A LOT of the work that goes into the creation of an album, the release of the album (PR, marketing, distribution, etc.), and post release responsibilities (booking, management, etc). At the end of the day they are definitely a business, so they need to cash flow and get an ROI from the bands they work with. Such is life. It‚Äôs not a bad thing if contract terms are win-win.

"xxketo","t5_2u80h","With the exception of pregnant women and young children, *fasting is for everyone.* Even people who are not keto, let alone fat-adapted. He is very emphatic about this point in his book - his only caveat is to check with your doctor about whether or not you will need to adjust your prescription dose during a fast, his example being that people on blood pressure medication often need less during a fast as blood pressure decreases during that time. He also recommends diabetics do fasts under the guidance of a physician (he does this in his clinic). If you cannot take your medicine on an empty stomach, he recommends taking it with a small serving of leafy greens (few enough calories to not negate the fast). 

For what it is worth, the ""hangry"" feeling is something that goes away. I used to think I couldn't fast, but it was an emotional response from being conditioned to think ""it's not healthy to skip meals"" and being so unaccustomed to being truly, actually, bonafide hungry. In our society, we're conditioned to eat by the clock, and we rarely get actually hungry. Once I'd fasted a few times, and saw that I was fine (better than fine, actually - I feel much less anxious when I fast), I stopped getting ""hangry"". I do get hungry (of course!) but I don't get cranky.

If you still think fasting isn't for you... well, you already fast every night when you sleep! Doing IF really is as simple as skipping breakfast. Fasting is not complicated, and there is a way to fast for everyone, to suit their lifestyle and health goals.

He does write that it's the pistol she likes best but does not write ""I go in with the express purpose of buying it to give to her.""

It's a safe assumption but the point is moot since he writes that he will transfer it legally which means it can't be a straw purchase no matter his intent. He would have a gun he legally purchased.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","I play Forsaken. I have since Vanilla. Sylvanas is my gurl.

I see a lot of folks upset about her nuking the tree and killing so many ""innocents"". Folks are upset that Sylvanas is ""acting out of character"" or that she is simply evil for the sake of being evil and I want to offer some counter points. 

Firstly, I don't think that Sylvanas sees anyone in the Alliance as an innocent because they are still a member of a faction that wants to (or at least until very recently) kill off the Horde.

Secondly, at no time was Sylvanas ever into the whole honor code of the Orcs or Trolls. Throughout her history in WoW she has time and time again stated that she seeks a way to ensure a future for HER PEOPLE aka Forsaken. Not Humans, not orcs, not trolls, not the Horde, but the undead. She has never shied from the fact she seeks power over life and death. 

Her allegiance to the Horde has always been about protecting her people and ensuring they have a future. She loves her Forsaken like she used to love and defend her Blood Elf/High Elf brethren. For all intents and purposes it seems the Forsaken are held in the same esteem as the BEs were before she was made into The Banshee Queen. She also says that ""Arthas murdered my people and turned me into this..monstrosity"" which could be a reference to her seeing her people as already dead and gone which is why she isn't all buddy buddy with the NE or Alliance, and lets not forget Arthas was a member of the Alliance and in many ways the Alliance allowed Arthas to do what he did. I would say she was wronged many times over by various leaders within the Alliance human and NE alike. Plus there is the official story that was given from Silvermoon that she died and her body was burned to ash in the fire that destroyed half the city...except she wasn't dead or burned to ash and was instead abandoned by the Alliance for Arthas to twist and torture until we get The Banshee Queen.

Thirdly, it's important to remember that Sylvanas had developed her own Plague to use on the Lich King's forces, a plague that didn't affect Forsaken but surely would kill anything alive and would break the Lich King's control over the non-Forsaken undead hit with it. That was in WotLK, so going that far back we know that she was trying to do something to give the Forsaken, and thus her, an advantage over the living and that making everyone undead was a possible solution she had in mind.

When we jump to Legion we have Vol'Jin acknowledge that he never trusted Sylvanas but ""that the spirits gave him clarity"". IDK what that is supposed to mean however I bring it up to draw attention to the fact that even Senior Leadership (VJ) within the Horde had major reservations about giving the Warchief mantle to her...maybe because Vol'Jin knew what she could and might do to the Alliance.

Fourthly Then there is the whole issue with Tirisfal Glades and the fact the Alliance think that it belongs to them while the Forsaken view it as their homeland. There have been countless attempts to regain that area. From small skirmishes to an attempted invasion by a land army the Alliance have continually assaulted and tried to take Lordaeron from the Forsaken.

I mean, the world is literally bleeding to death, there are still other threats in the void, her people cannot reproduce or grow in any natural way, and she wants to ensure the future for the Forsaken. Considering her past and the nature of what she now is, I don't think she is being irrational or evil for the sake of an easy story. I think she is trying to do what she believes will provide a future for The Forsaken.

Edit: The other thing I forgot to mention is Slyvanas' trip to Northrend and her visit to the realms of the dead. She has seen the Darkness and the ""Infinite Dark"", she saw creatures too abhorrent to even exist in the realms of the living. She ran into Arthas there, where he gets to endure a eternity of torment and abuse from the creatures in the Infinite Dark. She has seen what eternity await her and others like her. 

So I ask, if you knew what she did, if you visited the same realm and had to stare into the Infinite Dark with all its horrors, the onslaught of eternal torment and abuse waiting you and you kind, wouldn't you be willing to move heaven and earth for your people? When she committed suicide at Ice Crown she saw the Forsaken only as a tool of vengeance, when she returned to fight at Gilneas she saw the Forsaken as her brethren. The Forsaken have 2 options, eternal undeath in the land of the living, or an eternity of torture in the Dark.",1533081682

Northern Europe is not socialist either, they are market economies with more government entitlements than the US(aka a little more government than I prefer). 

 If you don't want to be called a socialist, stop calling yourself a socialist. It's simple. Believing in free college or universal coverage does not make you a socialist, wanting to abolish private capital does. ",1533081682

Constructing a power series from the real series you can only get 2 power series solutions, corresponding to sqrt(1+x) and -sqrt(1+x) so I and -I. But if you worked with a multivariate power series in terms of the coefficients of the matrix you should be able to get a power series solution locally around any of the square roots.

They were great people and the majority are like this. But I also met Muslims who treated women and all other non Muslims like shit, and said how someday the entire world will be Muslim.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So when something is related to or caused by drugs it falls under an umbrella of 'substance use disorders'. Often substance use disorders and mental health diagnoses can even go hand in hand and that's called co-occuring disorders (classic example is someone experiences a trauma and then self-medicates with substances like drugs or alcohol). Treatment is ideally a two-pronged approach that treats the substance use at the same time as working through the mental health side of things. I'm unfortunately not too well versed of people that are purely substance users due to how common underlying trauma or mental health disorders are, but when I was doing assessments/assigning diagnoses the substance use would generally be listed secondary to the primary MH diagnosis (often PTSD but sometimes major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.).

Also, I do t do the buy this here, that there. I don‚Äôt do the bulk stores for this reason. Not everything is a great deal, sometimes it‚Äôs a little manipulated, and my time has enough value to me that hitting multiple stores to save 2% or whatever is not going to happen.

"asktrp","t5_2y2sm","1. TRP is more about accepting that women treat men as objects of value to be discarded if they can upgrade and looks at concepts such as hypergamy... it‚Äôs also about learning to better ourselves knowing the way the world really is and not how we want it to be... it‚Äôs a bitter pill to swallow for many men... usually men that have spent years or even decades being fcked around and friend zoned... society will always try to shame these men for suddenly realising they don‚Äôt have to play the game society expects of them... if wanting the best for yourself is misogynistic to people from the outside.. then all I can do is shrug and say... meh TRP is a very positive and useful toolkit, it‚Äôs strengthened my relationships and respect for women as well as myself. I understand women much better these days, as they really are not as I want them to be. I‚Äôve never been happier living in reality...

2. Society is not totally dissimilar to the animal kingdom in the sense that deep down in our DNA a lot of our decisions are really quite simply primal. 
The top 10-15% tall alpha males who don‚Äôt need to understand TRP who  get their pick of the females... until the women need beta providers, then the women change sexual strategy. Women will shame a beta for attempting to fulfill his natural sexual strategy that is spreading his seed far and wide but simultaneously get giddy for an alpha male they know has 4-5 girls on the go at the same time. Beta males aren‚Äôt as desirable, TRP looks at ways to fix this in this lifetime.
These sorts of observations are valuable insights for typically beta males who grew up on Hollywood romances and a feminine upbringing of false narratives like being a gentleman or nice guy will get your dick drained 4 times on the first date.
Being a nice guy simply doesn‚Äôt get you laid like society conditions foolish young men to believe. TRP corrects this narrative.

3. TRP works so well that I‚Äôd go so far as to say it‚Äôs changed my life and increased my quality of life 10 fold.

4. I genuinely believe knowledge of TRP ultimately increases genuine understanding and connection with women, and allows us to live as we really are without needing to conform to any particular expectations society imposes on us.
My sex life increased maybe 10,000% since I really came to understand the concepts that applied to me... though I don‚Äôt think I could ever return to having a single monogamous relationship again, I love women and variety way too much... the threesomes, the lingerie they wear to impress me, the way they suck my dick with such enthusiasm... I‚Äôm living my dreams these days... I shudder when I think back to the mental abuse, sex used for bartering and boredom of monogamy

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Nah, to call that rape culture is a huge expansion of the term, since it doesn‚Äôt justify or enable rape in any way. Not all gender norms lead back to the most reprehensible crimes imaginable, sorry. 

And I dislike how you make this issue about women, when it‚Äôs really primarily an issue for men in today‚Äôs culture. Slut shaming is nowhere near the problem it used to be, and women can have plenty of partners without facing significant social backlash. 

The problem is that modern notions of sexual assault and harassment have become so loose that they‚Äôre overlapping with normal courtship behavior for both genders. Because men do most of the courtship though, they‚Äôre the most affected. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôve got some men saying, ‚Äúfuck that, the dating market just isn‚Äôt safe anymore.‚Äù Not because they think most women are out to falsely accuse them, but because modern public sentiment (and increasingly, laws) enable those who do, meaning *if* they happen to get mixed up with a crazy one, the society likely will take her side anyway. 

That some women enjoy being chased and saying ‚Äúno‚Äù when they really mean ‚Äúyes,‚Äù hasn‚Äôt hampered women‚Äôs lives in at least several decades, and that‚Äôs why there isn‚Äôt a prominent feminist initiative to get that changed. More often, it works for women than against them, whether it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre trying to weed out men who are just looking for another notch on their belt or to stroke their own egos.

However, if you mean't ""Don't have sexual relations with your customers or coworkers"", then I would agree. That type of interaction almost never winds up not being weird/awkward or (at worst) dangerous if/when things fall apart.",1533081687

Dear Pilots,We've made some changes to our special discount for Rise of Flight pilots who purchase Flying Circus. We have chosen to give ALL ROF users who supported us throughout our existence an additional discount. We underestimated the demand for this special discount and we didn't want to offend our most ardent supporters from well before ROF was listed on STEAM and our merger with 1CGS. We also could not easily calculate support levels from STEAM users. We have finally found a way to do that, so everyone who has paid any money for ROF content can get a special discount on top of the regular Early Access discount.   First, everyone who orders during the Early Access period gets a $10 discount off regular MSRP no matter what. Second, if you are an existing ROF customer and meet certain criteria you qualify for an additional discount. The criteria are as follows.Anyone who purchased content for ROF between its launch in 2009 to July 25, 2018 from our website, STEAM or a boxed or digital copy from an official retail partners during that time frame will receive an additional discount for a limited time.  ‚Ä¢	If you spent between $0.01 and $70.99 on ROF content you will receive an additional $5 OFF.‚Ä¢	If you spent between $71.00 and $200.99 on ROF content you will receive an additional $10 OFF.‚Ä¢	If you spent greater than $201.00 on ROF content you will receive an additional $15 OFF.The special discount period ends September 14, 2018.Flying Circus Early Access can be ordered  HERE.Additionally, ALL ROF users that have made any purchase of ROF content at any time over the years, we have placed an additional promo code for 25% OFF your next order from the IL-2 store in your ROF profile. Some ROF pilots have not had the chance to experience IL-2 yet so this is a great opportunity to give it a go! Sorry, but the code cannot be applied to FC, TC or BoBP. Finally, some have already ordered Flying Circus and are already enjoying Early Access, but do not have a ROF account. So as a thank you, we have placed an additional promo code for 25% OFF your next order from the IL-2 store in your IL-2 profile. Sorry, but the code cannot be applied to FC, TC or BoBP.To get your special discount you‚Äôll need to access your ROF user account on the ROF website (all ROF users created a ROF User Account during install) and retrieve a promo code we have placed in your user profile. Then return to the IL-2 website and place your order for Flying Circus. Enter your discount code at check out. The additional discount will be reflected in the final amount.NOTE: We no longer swap website keys for STEAM keys, so if you wish to own Flying Circus or any other IL-2 product solely on STEAM you will need to wait for the STEAM release at a later date. We do not know at this time if there will be launch discounts for FC, TC or BOBP on STEAM nor do we know the exact release date for these products on STEAM. However, if you buy one of these products on our website today you are welcome to link your STEAM account (assuming you own IL-2 on STEAM) with your IL-2 website account and play with this new content through your IL-2 STEAM install. For more information on our STEAM Linkage process please read our guide found  HERE.Sincerely,The Sturmovik Team

One, if people tend to save more of the new income, then that will push average debt levels downwards and lower interest rates. If people spend it instead, it will result in the growth of specific sectors of the economy, depending on what it is spent on. From a social perspective, we also want to know if addicts use their money on drugs or alcohol and we inadvertently end up encouraging their addiction.

Labour information is important because a UBI could significantly affect the labour market, which could have dramatic consequences since the labour market is \~50% of the economy. If it is not sufficiently offset by automation, it could do serious, far reaching damage. Figuring out exactly how much the labour market will be affected is a key part of all of these experiments.",1533081688

It was a new environment which was interesting but I can't believe they just completely kicked off the other half of the cast. I realize it was unrealistic in the first place to keep that many together as it is.

By far the hardest/emotional moments for me:

* Red flipping out on Freida missing out on seeing her grandkids
* Guards being dicks - the whole fantasy game pissed me off so much.
* Red telling Nicky it was okay
* Cindy testifying against Taystee
* Taystee talking to Caputo
* Tatystee being found guilty
* Freida telling Suzanne she used her for survival
* Blanca being handcuffed by ICE
* Caputo running after one of the guys that was responsible after the trial

Some of my favorite moments:

* Caputo in general
* MCC Woman getting her head shaved right before being released
* Seeing Pennsatucky escaped with Dixon and the gross rapist and then her surrendering
* When Pennsatucky and Suzanne became good friends in Florida
* Prison wedding
* Any time Badison was put in her place
* How the kickball game turned out
* Barb and Carol ending up murdering each other
* When D block discovered the poop
* When Ruiz went off on Daya for hitting the crow and she felt the good in her

Most wtf moment: 

* Piper's first bunkmate that murdered her children and then tried to kill Ruiz",1533081689

"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","My GI believes my joint issues are Crohn's related and that it's called ""arthopathy"" or something like that (there were some other terms, like ""axial"" thrown in, but that's over my head). There are many different types of arthritis, and my understanding is that the type that is enteropathic or related to IBD is not going to present with swelling or redness. The swelling or redness is seen more often with Rheumatoid arthritis and that is more damaging to the joint-whereas the Crohn's related arthritis hurts like a mother, but luckily does not cause damage to the joints. My CRP is always super elevated though, especially when my joints act up. Oh and my GI mentioned that the joint stuff can act up even if your gut is doing ok (super fun stuff).

I've met attorneys and loan brokers there as well as other real estate investors.

Also, get a free account on \[Meetup\]([https://www.meetup.com/](https://www.meetup.com/)) and search for real estate investing in or near your city and you may be able to find other free and low-cost events where you can network and learn.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","gf of a friend of mine ended the relationship. He didn't talk about it much and I just knew her  trough him. I liked her in a platonic way and we had a lot in common. After they broke up and my buddy didn't want to talk about it I texted her to ask why. We texted a lot and she then started to talk more about romantic stuff she missed out with him. Again, that woman was truly amazing, smart and funny and I really liked her. We texted every day for a couple of weeks. We talked about anything and it was just fun to write with her. But then she started to talk a lot more about things she would like to do with me. I changed the subject whenever she tried to come up with stuff like that because I felt really uncomfortable to hit on the ex of my buddy. I considered to do it back then but I felt guilty just thinking about it. However, a few weeks later our town celebrated something about how they managed to be a town for 200 years. It was just an excuse to have a big party and everyone got wasted for three days. So it was time to get drunk asap. We started to drink by a random friend of a few of mine friends. She was also there but not my buddy. It's a small town and everybody knows everyone and I knew he was just somwhere else drinking. Sooner or later I would met him at the party in town. So, I got a little drunk like everyone else and we all decided that it's time to go party. We've been on our way as she took me aside and asked me why I didn't react to anything that she said about us. I came up with a pretty lazy excuse that I am not interested in a relationship right now except I really was with her. But I just felt guilty and didn't want to had a relationship with the ex of my buddy without asking him first or what he would think about it. It just didn't felt right. The night goes on and our little group split up, I left the group by myself and met a few other groups of people I knew. It was just a couple beers and then find another people who I knew to drink with them. Our city had a lot going this night. They had stages and bands and a lot of entertainment. So I headed up to the metalhead stage and found my buddy going nuts on a metallica cover band. I joined him, we had a lot of fun and decided to get some more beer. After we grabbed our beer we walked away from the stage and sat down on the street. He sipped on his beer and said nothing more than ""I miss her."" I didn't mention her earlier or in the weeks prior to him but I knew immediatly that it was the right move not to date with her. I still felt guilty and was sorry even nothing happened between me and her. ",1533081691

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","&gt;You're defending it by comparing it to the 75mm Shermans, which are already the worst of the 4 main medium tanks at that BR.

Not hardly. If you're looking for a tank around 3.3-3.7 that can do it all, the Sherman is your tank.

It's got a gun that's easy to use, suited to almost any situation, and reloads fairly quickly.

Its mobility is average to above average relative to other medium tanks at that BR. It's certainly a lot faster than the Germans.

Turret traverse is good, the tank has a low-speed stabilizer which is pretty situational but occasionally comes in handy.

The armor is, overall, what you'd expect from a medium tank, enough to occasionally protect from a bad shot but not going to hold up against accurate AT fire. However, the Sherman's armor excels in a hull-down position, with good gun depression and strong turret armor with a small profile.

No other tank has this combination. German guns might be better, but you sacrifice armor and speed. T-34s are more mobile and may be better-armored, but don't have the gun depression and are all but forced to brawl. British and French both have their own M4A1s, and the other tanks in their trees have other advantages and disadvantages. Japan is... Japan and actually has no vehicles around this BR except for the JGSDF M24.

The 75mm M4 Shermans are the perfect middle-of-the-road tanks. They aren't particularly good at any one thing, but they also have no glaring weaknesses.

&gt;The 75mm is the weakest gun at T2 (other than the German 50mm). The 6 pounder has no HE filler but AP does just fine with spalling.

But HE filler is always better if you can penetrate anyway. More penetration beyond what is necessary to get through the armor is just a waste. One-shot kills are far from uncommon because of it, even without specifically targeting crew members. Often any hit forward of the engine compartment will finish a tank in one, maybe two shots.

And as far as the 75mm goes, even with lower-penetration M61, it has more than enough to get through the majority of what you will face. Nothing German is a problem, nothing Japanese is a problem, nothing French is a problem. British can occasionally be a bit tough but only in spots, and Americans rarely fight them, that would mostly be limited to the Japanese M24. Only the KV-1 will reliably stop your shots from almost every direction, in almost every spot on the tank, but even that still has its weak spots.

&gt;You make sound like it's super easy to kill T-34s with 75mm. As someone with a 6 KDR in my T-34 1941, I can assure you it's laughably easy to bounce shots from that gun. Angle the hull a tiny but, angle my turret a little and I can sit there repairing my breech while the idiot Sherman shoots at me over and over again.

Well, like you've said, idiots in Shermans, not the tank itself. Any vehicle is bad with a bad player at the controls.

Angled T-34 turrets are not a problem, the turret ring is exposed from all angles except the direct rear. Cheeks can usually be penetrated as well, but it depends.

Angled T-34 hulls can be difficult if the angle is correct, otherwise they don't provide much resistance. However, since Soviets have poor gun depression, they can't use cover effectively, and shots between the tracks or at the LFP are often available. But the turret is typically an easy enough shot anyway, so shooting at the hull often isn't necessary.

&gt;but good luck surviving anything in a Chaffee, your armor is just thick enough to set off the APHE. It's the easiest thing in T2 to one shot. Everything penetrates it and everything sets off in it, no over pen to worry about.

So your problem is with light tanks in general, not the Chaffee. Because if you're getting shot *at all* in a light tank, you're not playing light tanks correctly.

Heavy tanks are meant to survive AT fire. Medium tanks are meant to retreat under AT fire. Light tanks are not meant to encounter AT fire at all. Thus, if you're getting shot, you're playing them very wrong.

This is why their mobility is so key, and the Chaffee's biggest strength is in its reverse gears. You pop out, shoot, and reverse before the enemy has a chance to line you up and fire. Then you reposition. Instead of a long-range sniper like a TD, it's a close-range ambush tank, or a medium-range skirmisher. Harass the enemy, outmaneuver them, use cover to hide your movements and stay unpredictable. Scout enemy vehicles for your team. Stay mobile, stay hidden, stay out of enemy fire.",1533081692

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","As a person who has a huge mecha fetish, I guess I'll mention some mecha SRPGs.

**Super Robot Wars**  is basically what it says on the tin. You put a whole bunch of robots together and let them beat each other up in a turn-based fashion. It's a load of stupid fun. It helps that the [animations](https://youtu.be/DAJ7oVsZuQo?t=80) are pretty [good](https://youtu.be/i4jHEGYfFpk?t=181). And if you're a mecha nerd like I am you can see familiar faces. The games aren't too terribly on the difficult side (at least the one I've played) because it'd feel pretty bad if your Super Robots didn't turn out to be so super. Unfortunately, most of them aren't in English due to licensing issues, but the last few games have English versions (though you have to import).

**Front Mission** is a much more grounded and gritty approach to giant robots than SRW. I'm in the middle of 3 right now and it's fun but I can't really say anything else about the rest of the series. There's a lot of mech customization which tickles my pickle.

**Chroma Squad** is basically Power Rangers the SRPG. You play as a group of actors who want to make the best Power Rangers-esque show that they can. And they have a giant robot that you can use sometimes. There's an element of resource and base management because you have to buy props, equipment, and advertising for your show and you have limited funds. ",1533081693

Augyre is something I want to work, but like the other rotating keystone items just isn't worth it.


Stormfire has some nice applications and seems to be in a similar category as things like call of the brotherhood imo.


Ylfeban's..just no.. it isn't good and was just a thing to mess up trash to treasure for players sitting in the wrong map back when Crown of Eyes was good.


Static, I really really don't want to do the math on this item as to how it increases the effectiveness of your damage, but I imagine there is a threshold at low per hit damage values where it can massively increase your damage, some kind of Quill Rain LA maybe? Dammit now I have to go theorycraft a new build..


Coil.. it exists, it used to be good, now rares outclass it.


Fist, I SO WANT THIS TO BE GOOD, but it isn't, or is at least worse than something else. wanna scale the hit? Just play ice crash facebreaker. The flat on a spell? A good dagger/wand will do more. Best use I found was on a Hooves build I tried, but a shaper dagger would be better.",1533081694

But not likely. There are way too many stupid and pointless laws. Plenty that aren't dangerous criminals...many that are CEOs.

It's helped a lot that they are so open.  Do your siblings share both parents or only one?  It's interesting, the nature/nurture thing, bc all my older sibs are from each of my parents' prior marriages, where they got totally different financial ed from their primary custodial fams (I assume).  My younger sib and I are the more literate ones, although my mom's son has got it together since he has been married.  He struggled a long time to break into the middle class career-wise.  My dad's first batch of kids are much more laissez faire in their treatment of money as an ephemeral thing.  Their mom is a prodigious saver though.  I hope you do give your kids a solid financial ed.  I plan to as well.  I don't understand how one could  send their kids out into the world without a solid understanding of it.

Hah, my job... I am ready for something new (and a break).  It really couldn't be any better timing.  I have transitioned every other aspect of my life such that I currently have zero obligations, debt free, and have no expenses other than basic operations.

I see most conversations in the main sub people seem to work like hell and earn crazy amounts to guarantee to live comfortably off it eventually, whereas I want to work the bare minimum to have enough to milk, so I have a choice to not work, even if it means find something to do again eventually if I miscalculate.  Working 40 hours a week or more is just too damn much to raise a family and find a work life balance that isn't just recovering enough to go back to punch the clock.  It is malaise-inducing.  I am planning my escape!",1533081696
"Celiac","t5_2tnai","&gt;Gluten ""Allergy""

&gt;Gluten is a protein found in grains, such as wheat, barley and rye. Some people are allergic to wheat, but that is not the same as a gluten allergy. Gluten allergy is a misleading term commonly confused with wheat allergy, or sometimes celiac disease. There is no such thing as a gluten allergy, but there is a condition called Celiac Disease. Celiac Disease is a digestive condition that is potentially serious if not diagnosed or treated.  Symptoms of celiac disease include severe diarrhea after eating gluten-containing products, a rash, severe weight loss or failure to properly gain weight, and abdominal pain.  In small children, you may only see poor weight gain and no pain, or other symptoms.  Diagnosis of celiac disease can only be made by a board-certified gastroenterologist.  It must also be made when the person is eating foods with gluten, as gluten avoidance is the active treatment. 

&gt;A gluten intolerance is not an allergy, and there are currently no tests for accurate diagnosis. People with certain symptoms might need to be tested for celiac disease, but few people with gluten intolerance have celiac disease. Gluten intolerance is not an indication for allergy testing and is not a condition where an allergist could offer help. There are many people who label themselves as ‚Äúallergic‚Äù to gluten, and unfortunately limit their diet without having seen a specialist.  People with gluten intolerance should be seen by their primary care provider or referred to a gastroenterologist if there is concern about celiac disease.

Your doctor should know IgE is an allergic reaction.

The tests for celiac are:

TTG-IgA, TTG-IgG

EMA

DPG-IgA, DPG-IgG

Total Serum IgA is a control test to validate the relevant IgA tests that must also be run.

As Gripeaway said I think the best way around is to houserule level up perks as optional so you can build an advantage favoured build or a rolling build. The tick perks I would still make mandatory, since you have to work to achieve the ticks you could always try and FAIL your tickmark battle goal!. 

Perhaps there is a bonus you could get instead of taking a perk on level up. Maybe you cross off the perk instead of tick it (so it's filled), but instead of taking it you earn a free donation to the temple or something (10g value + two bless!). ",1533081700

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","I would disagree with you only in the sense that I don't think average citizens want to cut VA funding.  There are issues where 60%, 70%, 80% of the public agree but politicians won't act.  They no longer work for the people.  They work for large corporate donors.  Both sides.  

And somehow those same people have turned us against each other while they gorge on as much wealth as they can consume.  

I think it was Joe Rogan who was saying the other day, you can't be a liberal that supports gun rights or a conservative that is pro-choice.  You'll get kicked out of the tribe.  Everybody has to be on the same page.  

As a vet, I obviously support increased VA funding.  But tell me how I would go about making something happen in Washington.  

My vote?  Neither side is doing anything anywhere near what needs to be done for veterans.  Educate my Congressperson?  Yeah, unless I'm carrying a large check in my back pocket, forget about that.  

Tribalism makes these politicians immune to any consequence of not listening to the will of the people.  Many of these people have zero worry about ever getting kicked out of office unless they piss off a donor.  They've got people whipped up into such a tribal frenzy that if you're a republican politician from a red state, you could literally be an accused pedophile (and pretty much admit to it) and barely lose to a democrat.  Barely.  Moore only lost by 1.5 percentage points.  

What could be possibly have done or not done once he got elected that would cause him to lose his seat?  If ""God Fearing Christians"" will vote for you in the face of all that he was accused of, you have nothing to fear from the people if you end up coming out ahead.  

That's what tribalism does.  We the people are giving them a free pass to ignore us because we will support them over anybody from another tribe.  ",1533081700

If you've been to Cleric once and failed you have 1 Insight. Get some souls, I mean blood echoes, and travel back to the dream and talk to the doll to level up a bit. Get some healt and stamina :) You can do this as much as you feel the need to, just be wary that it gets progressively more expensive to level up. 

Also good to know is that you don't necessarily ""progress"" so much in Central Yharnham as you circle around and unlock various shortcuts. You'll be in that area for a fair bit but it gets way easier after the first time you unlock a shortcut and see the same light again. You'll have an easier time getting to Cleric Beast from there.

So there's either a giant plot twist, Sylvanas is an idiot, or a big mistake from the writing team. Two out of three options are terrible writing.

Not being able to fall asleep is a common withdraw symptom for weed.  Brain fog is too. Just take sobriety one day at a time and build upon that.  You can, and will, get better each and every day.

You're being started on an extremely low dose of escitalopram, so it's unlikely to be the case, despite sleep disturbances being fairly common when starting treatment. Lamotrigine has insomnia as a common side effect, as well, and is more likely to be the culprit. You may decide to wait and see, but consult a physician if this persists as sleep deprivation will only exacerbate bipolar disorder. Good luck.

Apple started to become uncompetitive between 2011 and 2013, when they dropped the XServe and Mac Pro lines. The top spec MBP's hung on a little longer, but at this point I'd agree that they're uncompetitive.

I wouldn't agree with the build quality thing - Lenovo's X-Series Thinkpads still have them pipped there, Apple build quality took a nosedive around the same time they transitioned from the pro market to the lifestyle brand market.

"crash_fever","t5_3h9po","Sorry, but I absolutely will not agree to something like this, let me try to explain:

Be it giving buffs to unused or used units, not only will it fuck the whole tier list up, but players in multiplayer will start looking for these ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù units.

You may not have heard of it, but a Korean game called Crusaders Quest have implemented inheritance and inlays, which helps characters by giving them crazy amounts of stats. This was quickly known to be P2W when it was released as these things are hard to get without spending money, this was, of course, redesigned so players are now able to get them without much problems. However, the inheritance and inlays completely fucked up what was once a good tier list for the players as all characters in the game no longer have fixed stats, and many veteran players have completely quit the game due to these implementations.

It will be a completely different story if they added this in Crash Fever. The game is pretty much P2W already, and adding this will only make it worse. Additionally. the inherit/ability system will also make both Game8‚Äôs and the Community‚Äôs tier list completely irrelevant. This will affect beginning players as well as F2P players as ultimates will no longer be the same and future quests will also have a recommended amount of inheritance put into the units. And last but not least, in multiplayer, players will no longer ask for units, they will ask for inherited units. See where I‚Äôm going here? Its not as if multiplayer is toxic and childish enough for a FES only team, but with the inherit/ability system, it will only be a lot worse than what it already is. 

My conclusion: 
No, I do not agree with this system whatsoever. Being able to receive a FES unit is amazing enough for many players, and honestly, if this ever gets added, I have only two options; Spend or Quit.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If you buy a bond, let‚Äôs say a treasury with a 2.4% interest rate, and rates go up so now there are new treasuries which are otherwise identical except for the fact that they pay a 2.8% interest rate instead of 2.4%, yes the value of your 2.4% bonds goes down. Why would anybody buy your 2.4% bonds for the same price you paid and make 2.4% if they can buy new bonds that are basically identical but pay 2.8%? 

The price people are willing to pay for your 2.4% bonds should adjust downward so the effective rate of return is the same as the identical 2.8% bonds.

This is how a bond works - there is a current face amount, a coupon, and a yield. The current face amount is the amount of principal the borrower must repay, and is quoted in dollars. The coupon is what % of the current face amount has to be paid in interest on each payment date, and is quoted as a %. So a $100 face amount treasury with a 5% coupon will pay the lender $100*5%=$5 on each payment date plus $100 of principal on the maturity date. The yield is the rate of return to the lender on buying the bond, and is effectively how much dollars did I put out vs how much dollars did I get back adjusted for the time period I held the position for. Importantly, with yield it doesn‚Äôt matter whether those dollars you get back are principal dollars or interest dollars, a dollar is a dollar. When you buy a bond for the face amount, the yield and coupon are equal to each other.

So going with your 2.4/2.8 scenario and assuming assuming $100 face amount and that there is only one payment date which is also the maturity date one year from the date you buy the bond to make the math easy, this is how it would work:

The 2.4% bond would pay an investor $102.4 on the payment/maturity date (2.4 of interest because the 2.4% coupon * $100 face = 2.4, and $100 of face amount), while the 2.8% bond would pay the investor $102.8 (same math but swap 2.8 for 2.4). Since the bonds are otherwise identical, you would not want to pay the same price for the promise to receive 102.4 as 102.8, you would adjust the price you would pay for the 102.4 promise down until the yield, the rate of return on investment is the same. Assuming you are willing to pay 100 for the 102.8 bond, the amount you should pay for the 102.4 bond is ~$99.6, since 102.4/99.6 is about the same as 102.8/100, so you get pretty much the same cash back for every dollar you invest.

That is why rates up means bond prices down - equivalent investments should earn equivalent returns.",1533081711

The game tells you when a robot is a nearby, it will scan you for a few seconds and fly away. If the game is working as intended (not bugged), you have plenty of warnings that one of those is right next to you. So you just gotta wait a little, or jetpack away and continue exploring.It's pretty uncommon to find planets with hostile sentinels that attack on sight, specially on your first planet.

And i believe the game throws you in a mildly hazardous planet so you learn how to recharge the protection. Both times i restarted in the NEXT update i found myself at one of these planets.

"PCOS","t5_2ryc6","The entire family of keto (ultra-low carb), low carb, or fasting diets/schedules is what you're looking for.

It's a slight misnomer to think keto/fasting is for weight loss. The science says that weight is a function of hormones. Keto and fasting are fundamentally hormone-control, not weight loss.

Why does it work this way? I'll be honest I barely know myself beyond a simple explanation of how hormones in general work and this is something I'm still trying to teach myself more about. But basically hormone imbalance is particularly finicky because each hormone can affect the rest. Think of it like receiving mail to your house. You get flyers, ads, brochures, personal mail, incorrect mail, mail from the previous tenant. But if you get a giant package that sits in front of your door and blocks your mail slot, you can't get anything else.

Metabolic Syndrome, according to the science as I know it, is caused or affected by many things. However it's no oversimplification to say that it is particularly caused by high insulin levels, insulin being a hormone.

Keto and fasting and the whole shebang isn't really a diet, or a way to lose weight. It's a scientific application of nutrition information. Eating certain foods causes insulin resistance, and insulin resistance leads to metabolic syndrome.

To me, it's kind of hard to look at a ""normal diet"" compared to a ""healthy diet"" and compare them when really what you're comparing is ""this diet will kill you and destroy your body, and the other diet won't."" Doesn't make a lot of sense to keep stuffing doughnuts in my face.",1533081714

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","First of all, thank you to everyone that provided their insight. I liked seeing view points from monogamous and poly experience and they both suggested the same result.

Update: when she got home, I brought up the need to stop the open relationship. I gave it a try, I'm unable to move past it. Unsurprisingly, she wasn't happy but she agreed that if I can't get past it, it needed to stop. I know I keep blaming myself, but putting a stop to this was overdue but I was afraid of resentful feelings but I have nothing to lose at this point. We both know I need to work on communicating things before they explode and I'm working on that. If the relationship continues, she's likely going to resent me but I had to give my own ultimatum. I told her I'm willing to end the relationship if it's what's healthiest for both of us.

Almost everyone has told me to cut and run. I would offer the exact same advice to someone with the same situation. I wrote the details in an emotional state and while everything is in fact true, I leaned toward only telling the negative things that have happened.

Some additional information: the case of cheating in the beginning was localized to a one time event. I also confronted the married guy about it. Obviously, I won't ever know for sure, but I really believe it to be a one time ""mistake.""  It has been almost three years since it happened, with no other mishaps. Again, I know for a fact I try to absorb blame in situations, but when it happened I was in a darker place and she had stuff going on. We weren't there for each other. I believe she reached out to someone to talk to and one thing led to another. Again, not taking blame here as this is entirely on her. I moved on from that event but obviously it was dredged back up when the open relationship started.

To clear up things a little.  We didn't decide to open the relationship immediately once she brought it up again. We talked about it for about two months before fully deciding on it. We we both in therapy at the time and I discussed it heavily during my sessions. I obviously have ""people pleasing"" tendencies and I knew what was happening.

Not to defend her but there are also ""redeeming"" qualities. Yes, these are probably present in any healthy relationship.

Did she violate the ground rules? Yes. Should this be the end to the relationship? Yes. Am I going to? I'm going to sleep on it for a couple days (probably gets interpreted as being too afraid, which might be true. It's a hard decision).

As one comment said, I wasn't looking for advice but rather ""emptiness of false reassurance."" This is very accurate. I obviously hoped to hear ""it will be okay"" replies but got the truth I needed.

I'll try to keep tabs on this post but it's pretty overwhelming as to what I should do.  A lot to think about for sure. Thanks again, everyone.",1533081716
"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Thanks for taking the time to write your very thoughtful response. 

The situation is handled for now. Apparently dozens of angry phone calls from various parents and coaches worked pretty well and he gets to play. Yay. 

As for the troublemaking coach, I describe him as he has described himself while trying to intimidate people. He brags about his criminal background and does not mind going back to jail/prison for even the slightest percieved insult. Example A being the fist fight he started with a parent whose child got overheated during a game on a 90+ degree day and started puking. Parent wanted the kid off the field. Coach Jailbird did not agree and when the parent overruled him, the coach started swinging. This isnt someone who has turned his life around but has a past. This guy is deep in the throes of whatever troubles he has. 

As far as private league/travel ball goes, we actually already play for one of those teams  but they pause activity for 2 months in the fall to let the kids all play city league. They're talking about pulling out of city league altogether after this mess though. Shockingly (/s) most of the kids who the league had issues with switching teams were also travel ball players. I suppose we will see. I'd be fine with playing 100% travel and no city league after the drama of the last week. 

At any rate, thanks again. ",1533081716

So many better opportunities to allocate your capital. IMO you are more in love with the company name than how the actual company is ran.

2) Disney isn't an innovative company. All they do is acquire companies. ESPN, Star Wars, Fox, etc. What do they really have to show for those acquisitions? ESPN viewership is a disaster, Star Wars fans are boycotting Star Wars because they can't keep SJW and politics out of the movies (and because the movies are genuinely terrible).

3) You've owned the company for 3 years and what have you really gained? 6% gains?

Just practice.  See how hard you can stop with the front only without doing a endo in some grass/parking lot/flat trial area.  If you throw your weight back as you brake you should be able to skid your front tire without the rear coming off the ground.  You will stop much faster (like 5x) then you would if you use the rear.  Try going around your entire trail without using any rear brake - just force yourself to learn, go slower around the trail so you don't kill yourself.  Then once you get that down go back to adding in the rear brake.

I don't think I'd be able to control my speed with just the rear - I use some front brake even when going downhill at a extreme angle.  Just be careful when attempting to turn while going DH and using the front brake at the same time, that is recipe for sliding the front out and you go down fast.  I don't think I've ever gone OTB, front sliding out while turning is the only way I've gone down from the front brake.

Federal prosecutors are investigating former lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., and former Obama White House Counsel Greg Craig, NBC News confirmed, citing multiple sources familiar with the matter.

CNN first reported the existence of the investigation.
Prosecutors for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York opened the investigation following a referral from the office of special counsel Robert Mueller, the sources told NBC.

NBC previously reported that Mueller had been looking into Podesta and his Democratic-leaning lobbying firm as part of its broader investigation into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.
Tony Podesta is the chairman of the Podesta Group. His brother, John Podesta, was the campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton and is not currently affiliated with the lobbying firm. He is also not part of the investigation.
A representative for Tony Podesta declined to comment to CNBC.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You need more lines of credit than just one credit card to prove credit worthiness to the lenders when applying for a mortgage.  

Credit is like a bucket, the more accounts, and bigger the limits, the bigger the bucket banks trust you with.  Ideally, you'll want about 4 lines of credit and an auto loan or two for the lower mortgage rates.  So something like your amex, amazon prime (5% cash back on amazon purchases), your bank's, and some store card you use a lot (costco?).

Don't ever close your oldest line of credit, it establishes your history, and keep your usage around 10% of the total credit limit to get the score to over 800. The more filled your bucket (% of utilization) the more it splashes when you walk around, the more risky you are. The less filled the bucket it, the less risk, higher your scores.

Source: my job as a finance manager.  I've seen a large sample size of credit from 850 score (myself) to 300 and so bad there's no score.  Even people with all closed revolving/credit cards, paying mortgage, and paid off autos have low-mid 600 scores.",1533081721

Also fun fact, the DOJ did look into the whole snafu 2 months ago and released a 568 page report saying Comey was not biased and confirmed the original investigation was right that she was horribly negligent and mishandled classified intel. This again confirms that she dug her own grave, the Russians just helped take pictures of her doing so.

Have you actually looked at some of the emails? They're very damning. There's one email chain for example that talks about trying to infiltrate my own religious group and coopt its platform to influence voters, while also simultaneously insulting us like crazy.

"wow","t5_2qio8","I don't buy it. 

Firstly, it's never okay to kill innocent civilians in times of war. There's even a whole section in the U.N. human rights charter about not killing civilians and destroying important religious and historical sites in times of war. She did both. I know this is a fantasy fiction and it's not real life, but I'm just using it as a basis on what is ethical and not during times of war. 

Secondly, it's never okay to attack an enemy without first declaring war. I know it sounds stupid, but countries have always declared war before launching an attack on their enemy. The two factions were technically not at war with each other at the end of Legion, even though they are not at good terms.

The reason it makes sense is because the world is much bigger than Horde vs Alliance. There are many other factions in the game. How do you expect the neutral factions to be friendly with you when you just killed thousands of innocent civilians and attacking people without warning? How does the Horde expect to gain allies after this atrocity? ",1533081723

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","There's no one right way to watch them.

Rogue One is a great movie, but you might miss a few of the contextual things that make it a great tie-in to the others. Still, could be a good way to draw you in, and then watch the original (Episode IV, A New Hope) right after, as Rogue One ends *right* before Episode IV begins. It's an excellent lead-in.

Personally, I would *not* watch them in episode order (that is, starting with Episode I and going in order from there). Some people love the Prequels, but I find them a bit harder to watch, and I would venture to guess based on your comments that their unique, uh, ""charm"" may be lost on you, and trying to watch them first is not likely be enjoyable enough to suck you in.

What I would recommend is what's called ""Machete Order"" (I forget why, I think the screen name of the guy who first came up with it). Start with Episode IV, the original (or Rogue One and then Episode IV), then Episode V - Empire Strikes Back; then, watch the prequels as a ""flash back"" to get the back-story and set up the climax in Episode VI (Episode I doesn't provide much, you can skip it if you want). Then flash-forward to ""resume"" with Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. Finish with the Sequels.

So:

* Rogue One (optional)
* 4 - A New Hope
* 5 - Empire Strikes Back
* 1 - The Phantom Menace (optional, you can totally skip)
* 2 - Attack of the Clones
* 3 - Revenge of the Sith
* 6 - Return of the Jedi
* (watch Rogue One here as a flash-back if you don't start with it)
* 7 - The Force Awakens

"FFBraveExvius","t5_34n2x","I think it's more out of concern of the future, for me. For example, I could have thrown my lapis at Lid and Nichol and Raegen, and they're good units. But since I can clear as is with lesser ones, I chose to keep going with my current team. Later on, when content actually progresses to the stage I can't clear, I want the option to pull better units that will enable me to keep clearing things.

For me, the main drive to push me to quit (apart from not adding UOCs lol) would be if there starts being content I simply can't beat, especially time limited content with rewards I'd lose forever. The moment that happens, the moment my desire to keep trying gets killed.

So in order to prevent that, I restrain myself from pulls when I'm perfectly capable of clearing everything in one or two tries, and stockpile in preparation of a day that I know will come when I can't do that any more. That's why I focus on the most meta breaking units and the like, to get the longest best return from the spending.

But you're entirely right, I could hoard and hoard and then drop 1000+ pulls on one unit and never get them too. I saw that post about Claic yesterday dropping like what, 400k lapis and not getting lolFayt? But if that happens, it happens, the best I can do is prepare with the most chance to mitigate it occurring to me heh.

All that being said, I'm not entirely sure who or what to target next to pre-emptively strike on team improvement. There's a dozen DPS unit improvements but tank/healer/supports seem to be stagnant. Top of the lists are 7*s of units we even have today for most of them, even. I suppose we'll see how banners play out in GL.",1533081726

Make sure you obey any laws that are applicable to your country and the recipients country. If we find out that you are breaking them we will ban you.

As a reminder, all posts require a timestamp with the knife open and the blade visible.  This is a picture of the knife with your handwritten username and the date to prove you possess the item in question. Additionally, please make sure to have a grade:

Quality [Q] Levels (use + or - accordingly):

* ""A"" - New, has been taken out of the box a few of times, never used to cut or been carried
* ""B"" - Light wear, been carried, non damaged. Sharpened by someone who knows what they're doing (aka not most of us).
* ""C"" - Moderate wear on handle or blade, may have been reprofiled, sharpened not super well, modded in any way, need sharpening; mechanisms (non lock related) may not function properly
* ""D"" - Things are broken.


Until you have successfully completed a sale or trade, you can only post one knife at a time. This means one thread, one knife, and that's it. NO EXCEPTIONS  

Once you successfully have completed and got trader flair a sale or trade, you can post however many knives for sale as you want! Please still try to keep them all in one post, though, to avoid spamming our page.  

Please make sure your prices aren't ridiculous.  You will be called out if you're asking an unreasonable amount.

Your prices should also be in the form of Paypal Goods and Services, with any fees added.  All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 

Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  

If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear. 

As always, please don't be a dick.  Message the mods if you have any questions!

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33",""" Charity is an inefficient way to solve the resource distribution  problem, but it is the only solution Capitalism offers. That's a flaw in  Capitalism. ""

It isn't the only at all. People are more prosperous around the world since Capitalism then anytime in human history. It allows a farmer, who would have had to give his crops to a Feudal lord or the government (notice how Feudalism and Communism share a lot in common). It has created the system of distribution and supply where the world could, if it wanted, feed all the poor. Now people decide not to, not because the system tells them no, but because they don't want to. 

The problem is human nature. Human nature to burn crops and steal from people. 

Like the saying goes:

""Capitalism is the worst Economic system, except for all the others.""

This Tweet isn't great because they're using Chipotle, one of the most charitable organizations that raises millions for organizations and donates a lot, and uses them giving a celebrity free chips and guac as how bad Capitalism is. They post it on Avocado day where Chipotle is giving away  free guac to it's customers. Something that will cost them a lot more than the lifetime supply. 

"" That's not meant to be a defense fo Socialism--it's a critique of Capitalism. ""

Capitalism has a lot of issues, giving away thousands of dollars in free product to a celebrity for promotion isn't one of them. ",1533081728

Yup. It was the *opposite* of sophisticated --- it was rough-hewn, vernacular music created by the lowest class. It was not fancy classical music. The first hit song in jazz was called ""Funky Butt"". 

But let's be clear: The fact that it was not ""sophisticated"" and """"intelligent"""" is what made it great. And at the same time, Louis Armstrong transcended ""sophisticated"" ""intelligence"" to the level of pure genius. ""Sophisticated"" and ""intelligent"" just aren't adequate words to express the greatness of jazz -- they're just too fucking snobby.

However, I would still recommend it if you guys enjoy old-school Call of Duty (e.g. the MW's) and have a PC that can be used for gaming because it is hella fun and NOT pay-to-win.

In addition to Ironsight, I've recently been up to some of MW3's spec ops. Multiplayer is dead on the PS3, and I haven't really played spec-ops a lot so I decided to give it a shot. I still find it difficult, even on the regular difficulty (don't know why, it's fucking AI for Christ's sake).

The Russians didn‚Äôt need to hack the machines themselves, they did enough hacking the DNC, colluding with Wikileaks, colluding with the GOP to purge rolls and pass draconian ID laws, targeting people on Facebook not just to vote for Donald Trump but more importantly to stay home and simply not vote, and possibly hacking election commissions‚Äô computers to unregistered a bunch of people.

Hacking the machines would be too much of a smoking gun and it would have been caught and reverted, and it honestly wasn‚Äôt needed.",1533081730

Did I ever say that?  Now the All-Star game is essentially a show case of how inferior MLS is to the best leagues in the world.  The format is a conceit that at best, all the best players in MLS combined are a good match for a preseason European team.  I do not think it is a good advertisement for the league.  If anything, the All-Star game is a great piece of evidence for why you should not watch MLS and instead should follow foreign leagues where each club is better than all the best players combined in MLS.  

It is not like 2 million viewers makes the All-Star game a particularly valuable TV commodity.  The league should prioritize presented a good advertisement for the league over just getting as much viewership as possible.",1533081730

I had a Citi Hilton Reserve, which was transferred to an Amex Hilton Ascend towards the beginning of this year. I finished the $10k spend, but my certificate never came. I reached out to Amex multiple times, and they seemed very unfamiliar with the terms of the $10k carryover bonus. Finally reached out to someone via Twitter who knew about the offer, but he said I don't qualify for the bonus because the last charge that pushed me over the $10k threshold had a TRANSACTION DATE within the anniversary year but the POSTING DATE was one day later (so one day outside of anniversary year). 

I understand that it's usually recommended to have all charges posted a few days before the deadline so this doesn't happen, but am I really SOL here? I can't find anything in Amex's T&amp;C that specifies that they go by posting date and not transaction date. ",1533081731

"gtaonline","t5_2xrd1","No it's best to run those 3 plus cargo and guns. Sell all 5 at the same time, it's just that you won't be selling a full shipment of guns or cargo. 

I think it's important that this guys method is the most *efficient* way of selling the warehouse. That means the way to make the most amount of money by doing the least amount of work, in this case using the least amount of sell missions and time. 

To reduce the number of sell missions, you want to fill up the stock of an item and sell it as soon as you can once it's full. In this case, 3 items fill up in the same amount of time, 20 hours. Now I know it's confusing because I just said you want to sell them at full stock, but in terms of efficiency, you want to sell everything at the same time and here's why: If you don't sell the other 2, they'll fill up their stock before the other 3 can refill their stock, so now you have another 2 full items that you have to sell. So that means you're doing 2 sell missions every 20 hours, when you can just be doing 1, for the exact same amount of money.

Yes.  If it meant ""disregard that single thing he said"", I don't think it would have used the words ""though shalt not be afraid of him"".  Don't forget that fear is the Biblical word for respecting/revering.  It instructs us to completely disregard the person, not the message.

1. Worked out a deal for PFH with an author for a sizable book.  Did all the work, and the author paid me... in his local currency.  The Australian dollar, which is valued significantly lower than the US Dollar.  So I expected an $800 USD payday, but got $800 AUS, which came out to around $580 USD BEFORE paypal fees.  

2. Finished a book (actually the last book in a series), but got ghosted by the author.  They completely disappeared on me.  Had to get ACX involved, and the book didn't go up for sale until 9 months after I finished it.  In the last 8 months it has sold 20 copies.",1533081732

Kind of an inherent issue with reactionary ideology. They hated the modern world and the Weimar republic, but once the Reich was dead it was dead and there was no returning to the Empire as it was. The Reich just existed because it existed, because it it was just a structure that happened to evolve over a thousand years. Whereas the reaction was formed specifically out of incredible resentment towards the democracy that had killed it. And they were the defenders of Christianity and tradition against the evil modernist atheist swine, but at the same time they didn't really even believe in God and thought the religion had a weakening effect among the people.

The only problem is it doesn't really test what you've learned, it's teaching you a completely new set of rules and throwing a tonne of info at you. The challenge would come from processing all this information you won't need again, as opposed to the techniques you've adapted naturally. 

Having the staff fight and even die sounds great. Maybe it could be that after a certain time, Sahelanthropus would target a platform and try to sink it. In which case, you would have to use a turret or something to draw it's attention. If the base went under, it would trigger a game over, since an entire unit would be wiped and that would be too hefty a punishment.

It's definitely a cool idea, the scenario is fitting and it sounds like a good finale. It sounds kinda similar to what I've heard mission 51 was meant to be, with Diamond Dogs helping to take him down. But there's so much going on, it doesn't sound practical from a gameplay perspective.",1533081733

The main things I'd say are 

- How much travel do you current forks have? The 55 might be too different in height/travel and would spoil the handling of the bike, but the 44 can be adjusted to a shorter travel.

- Looks like the forks have different thru-axle standards so would need different front wheels. Your current wheel likely isn't compatible with either fork.",1533081733

Battle Royale games are bigger than Survival? Wow, impressive marketing research you did there.

You forget that DayZ is one of the reasons Battle Royale games became popular. And the reason DayZ was even popular in the first place was a because of its permadeath PVP and its unique social interactions it brought. Battle Royale games only have the PvP. Many players like me are sick of battle royale games that don't offer unique experiences. We're waiting for DayZ or any other proper survival replacement. It obviously won't be as big as battle royale games, but that was never the point so I don't know why you even brought it up.

And just because Arma already had basic systems that were technically what they wanted in DayZ, doesn't mean they worked well and should of been left as is to speed development along. The way survival needs work is they have multiple factors that simply aren't common among other big online pvp survival games, like specific kinds of sickness and poisoning as well as nutrition values being taken into account. Something like Rust is much more simple. Hunger goes up down at the same rate depending if you're standing still or running. Thats it. Some foods will refill your gauge faster than others and there is only one type of poisoning which is food poisoning. Drinking salt water and vinegar (if you're unlucky) will have the exact same effect of just throwing up. If you lined up 3 people next to each other and had each one try salt water, vinegar, and raw meat, you wouldn't be able to tell who ate what (assuming the vinegar guy got unlucky). So at its core it only has one type of sickness. And from all the other survival games I've played, they follow this very simple template. Which is not the case with DayZ. I hope that gives you an example of how not-so-basic DayZ's revamped systems are, because it applies to all the other systems you mentioned but I really don't want to type out 3 essays explaining them.

And DayZ has always been a niche game, it just got really popular for the PvP attention it brought for a few months, after that the mod servers were plagued with carebear epoch servers that weren't DayZ at all, showing how it was still niche despite the popularity. Thats just a fact, no special ingredient, it was simply the only one of its kind at the time. It was never meant to be as famous as it was, it was simply a catalyst to BR games. So there is no way its going to be as popular as it was and to expect that is the stupidest thing I've ever heard and I don't know why people keep saying this shit. Because all it does is perpetuate the idea that DayZ will always be a failure no matter what simply because it can't meet this impossible goal for itself. When has ANY super popular game ever gotten its peak playerbase back? No one ever asks that and asks that of DayZ, ridiculous.",1533081733

Thanks for listening to difficult words with such an open mind.  That‚Äôs wonderful to see. 

Great to hear you have an appointment with your therapist.  A thought - I would consider it to be poor practice for your therapist, who have been hired to help you, to work with you both as a couple.  I highly recommend you get someone else, perhaps even who works in the same practice, to work with you together.  You don‚Äôt want your gf to feel like she‚Äôs being ganged up on - you want her to feel that the therapist is about your relationship and what‚Äôs best for the both of you. 

Re the eating disorder.  We are attracted to who we are attracted to, but for you there might be an overlay of something that may or may not be something you can shift.  If you can‚Äôt shift it and her looks are so important that it affects your ability to be in a relationship, then you may need to think about what that means.  It is really your issue either way, but the added disorder is something that is important for you to own, for her sake and yours. This is really good one for you to work on with your therapist as it will affect the rest of your life too.  

What happens to her body and her weight over the years us an understandable concern, but not really your issue.  You have to let her be the person she is and support her the way she is.  There is no other way that can work.  Remember, there is a lot of baggage and meaning that you attach to the weight - meaning and baggage that aren‚Äôt present for most people and probably not for her.  So she doesn‚Äôt see herself or her behaviour in the same way you do, and she doesn‚Äôt need to.  Just because you would put in the effort doesn‚Äôt require her to put in the effort.  I understand that feeling and the desire for her to do so, but it‚Äôs simply not your responsibility.  

One final question.... It‚Äôs interesting to say that if she‚Äôs 40 and this weight that you would feel differently.  How would you feel if she had a missing leg and gained weight?  If either of these scenarios would cause you to still be attracted to her, despite her weight, then it‚Äôs a sign that this is simply a decision you are making, not a core attraction issue.

The difference between this and revolutionary project is that revolutionary project came out of nowhere and it was ready to go.

Steve Jobs came to podium and showed his iPhone. His features. His capabilities. Whole world wanted to buy it immediately no matter price.

Bill Gates released his Windows. Cute icons, mouse support, easy to navigate your PC. Everybody wanted that and needed that. PC went main platform and killed Amiga and more advanced hardware thanks to this software.

John Carmack showed the world Wolfenstein and Doom. You were watching game world from your own perspective. It was fast paced. Visually breathtaking. Technologically genial. It set new standards for PC gaming, created new genre and franchise is still earning money 25 years later.

Jun created... Tweet with ""world exchange yaaaay"" which is in his head... He came to podium multiple times with.... Empty hands... But he told us that everything in his imagination is amazing and we will see it soonTM. Nobody knows what his product is or will be doing. Meanwhile Coinbase is experimenting with Amazon vouchers (which was kind of originak OmiseGo plan to cash in and out but this plan vanished somewhere). Binance is expanding to Malta and getting huge. What will happen in 25 years? Doom, Wolfenstein and even Windows will probably still exist in form of latest versions. OmiseGo (amazing marketable name, congratz) will be probably just entry in history snapshot on CMC. I can be wrong of course and Omise will unsoon the sooned and blow my mind.

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I would recommend spacing out your usage more. The mg dosage you took is on the high side, but still safe. It‚Äôs the frequency that can be detrimental to your neurological health. MDMA has been found to be neurotoxic with repeated and frequent use. Specifically, it causes damage to the serotonergic neurons which have many functions including mood, perception, appetite, sleep etc. This has been shown to decrease overall cognition and intelligence. 

My advice would be to reduce the frequency of usage first and foremost. I don‚Äôt know exact dosing schedules, but I‚Äôd recommend a couple months between uses. This reduces the risk of serotonergic neurotoxicity cause my MDMA. Also, dose does influence how much damage is done so lowering that slightly (maybe 200mg per roll) would also help. On top of that, using supplements that help the brain grow and support overall brain health too wouldn‚Äôt hurt. 

Here‚Äôs a brief article about MDMA‚Äôs neurotoxicity: https://drogriporter.hu/en/dose-of-science-is-mdma-neurotoxic-for-human-users/

But here goes.

In 1791, (when the bill of rights went into effect), you could own any arm. This included muskets like the army had, but it also included cannons and bombs. It even included repeaters like the puckle gun,  Lorenzoni repeating flintlock pistols, and the Cookson rifle. They all existed at the time. The Lorenzoni had existed over a century at the time.

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","There is quite some room to interpret the exception in the relevant EU directive strictly, meaning that such measures could be understood as a last resort with tight boundaries.

Fastcraft is a project for end users and my own curiosity about what is achievable. I don't want to give the technology and engineering behind it away for free, much less have it copied without attribution. Plenty of my contributions to Forge and other projects are open source, Fastcraft is not one of them and we all know how readable Java bytecode normally is.

Regarding compatibility I don't believe it's even effective to reverse engineer Fastcraft. The internals are comprehensive and dissimilar from anything else, they are also obviously quite well protected. FC2 works with big subsystem replacements, the vanilla architecture is not suitable for small amendments when targeting this level of performance.

My idea for fixing most compat issues is to first fix FC2 itself, add generic workarounds/patches, document limitations. The pressing issues right now are the incomplete Forge model support in my model pipeline and mods reflecting/editing MC classes. There's not much to be gained by looking at FC's sources, it just needs work on my side, be it fixes or API to do things cleanly.",1533081739
"rutgers","t5_2risk","RCC (Rutgers Canto Club) is more focused on cultural aspects of Hong Kong rather than actually practicing Cantonese speech. Although you'll definitely find other cantonese people/cantonese speakers, the focus of the club isn't primarily about practicing the language.

If that isn't a concern and you're more focused on the community, then by all means RCC is a good starting place to meet really cool people. Furthermore, if you just wanna meet asian people in general I highly recommend checking out these other orgs:


**TASA** (Taiwanese American Student Association) Thursday nights 9:30 PM usually in LSC room 201 AB

**CSO** (Chinese Student Organization) Wednesday nights 9:30 PM usually in LSC room 202 ABC

**VSA** (Vietnamese Student Association) Varying dates as they started up again relatively recently but they meet at 9:30 PM as well, I'd check out their facebook page for more specific details
and if you were wondering

**RCC** meets on Tuesday nights but the starting time varies (iirc last year they started around 10:15pm?)

I've been to almost all of RCC/TASA/CSO events in the past two years and they're a friendly bunch. It's ideal to start in the beginning of the school year because more people are getting acclimated so you'll fit right in. 

If you got any other questions about anything asian org related don't be afraid to reply or shoot me a pm.
I'm on next year's TASA E-Board so if you do happen to stop by, say you're the dood from reddit and hopefully you can find me and hopefully see you at an RCC event!

&gt; Re: my plans, I'm doing some more training this fall to add to my skill set and starting a freelance business in 2019. I have no idea if that will work out though. I'll still look for jobs. I'm also looking at teaching English overseas but that is quite involved and possibly not a sustainable option.

There certainly is a ton of great support on Reddit and other expat forums for understanding the ins out and outs of moving abroad.

&gt; Given the many highly-skilled people facing this problem, it's hard to be optimistic.

Well, yes and no. Unemployment is super low right now at least in the U.S. (I'd assume Canada as well?) and 2 out of 3 40something *did* find jobs in tech. And 3 out 4 found management jobs in the tech domain. So maybe just keep honing and making sure everything you're doing is as good as possible and retain a smidgen of optimism.

I don't think the default controller mapping will be suitable for a lot of games, so I would recommend offering a selection of mappings.

Some points regarding the mappings, based on my experience using a Game Cube controller on my N64 with an adaptor:

* The Nintendo 64 controller places the B button where the X button is on the 360 controller
* The L button is rarely used, but R and Z are used a lot. It feels more natural to put them both on the same level (eg Z = Left Trigger, R = Right Trigger, or Z = Left Bumper, R = Right Bumper)
* C buttons on the right stick works well for games where it controls the camera, however some games (eg Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask) use the C buttons for items. In Ocarina of Time I would map Left and Right C to the 360's Y and B buttons, and C Down to the unused right bumper or trigger",1533081741

If the treatment is just more oxygen, maybe hyperventilating a la Wim Hof would be beneficial as hyperventilating increases the blood oxygen saturation over base-line.

I'm sensitive to smells, I need to use special clothes detergants or else the smell of my clothes will bug me all day.

Directly to Zaff's staff barrel (although the normal varrock teleport is really close)

Maybe the workers entrance or to the museum

Varrock east bank maybe if museum is too strong

Lumber yard although this might shift plank making meta?


It is hard to think of a good teleport spot in all fairness because the most useful part of varrock is arguably the ge, and there is a teleport directly there already.

If you really think it needs a buff then maybe it could allow us to contact zaff to send staves to our bank and he can take the gold from our bank (granted we have the gold)?

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","2 faults with this conclusion. The first is this:

&gt;In contrast, when competitive video games jump from one popular IP to the next.

Let's look at the most popular esports.

1. League of Legends. League is now on Season 8 while being the most watched and played video game for over 6 years now. It continuously gains viewership for its world finals yearly and has viewership totals rivaling the NBA Finals. With some rattling of the sabres from the Dota/CS:GO crowd, the esports scene in this game has undeniably controlled esports market share and its developer has a firm hold on the organization of the competition. LoL is going nowhere. 

2/3: Dota 2/Counter Strike: Global Offensive. I include them together because Dota has a higher prize pool value than CSGO (and LoL for that matter) but CSGO has more viewers on average. Both of these games, despite their subtitles, are not true sequels - Dota 2 is the functional equivalent to Dota 1 and contains all of the same heroes and an engine that has identical gameplay structure as Dota 1, with turn rates and all. This game has been played competitively for nearly 15 years and has been a serious esport for 8 years. It is not new, and it is not a sequel. Similarly, CSGO is a spiritual equivalent to Counter Strike Source; with a few additions in the form of new weapons and a slightly modified weapon balance, as well as minor map changes, the game is fundamentally a remake. The competitive map pool consists completely of maps from CSS. CSS has had a competitive lifespan of roughly 15 years as well. 

4: StarCraft 2. The successor to StarCraft 1, the original esport (Quake fans begone). StarCraft and StarCraft 2 are very similar games, but it has the most differences from its original compared to other large esports. Still, it is now 8 or so years old and the franchise is nearly 20 years old - if there is any tradition in esports at all, it comes from StarCraft and the Korean scene, who provided an example for future professionals in all regions in terms of work effect and tournament organization. 

These 4 games occupy (guesstimating) 80% of the esports market share. The rest is split between the fighting game community (mainly Super Smash Brothers Melee, 15 years old, and the greater FGC who doesn't stick to one game like other esports do) and overwatch. These 4 aforementioned games are ancient in the scope of video gaming as a whole, and all have roughly the same explosion time in the west - around 2010-2012, with StarCraft 2 introducing esports to the mainstream, Twitch.TV becoming a widely viewed website, and more quality of life/technological advances that allows more strict skill based matchmaking and online play between regions. The competitive games that were born during this era still dominate the market today, are ancient IPs in the market overall, and have yet to be unearthed by newcomers, such as Overwatch or Heroes of the Storm. So your justification of esports being marketed on their ""newness"" or that popular esports ""jump"" from one popular IP to the next is false - the relative viewership and popularity of the the most popular esports has maintained consistent for nearly a decade. There is no flux as you make it out to be.

The second issue that you ignore is the concept of multi-game teams that have creates this sense of tradition that you claim doesn't exist. Many esports fans are fans of organizations that span many games - Optic Gaming particularly has a very dedicated fan base (the ""Green Wall""), as does Faze Clan. The multi-game organization structure lends itself well for fans to adopt new games and avoids any disruption that a new popular game would create in the greater esports market.

tl;dr This is an insane wall of text, but it is required to show that the issues you take aren't really ""issues"" at all. Most popular esports today became popular at the Renaissance of esports in general, and haven't been upturned by new ""popular"" IPs at all. So there has been no deviation from the ""place"" and ""past"" of esports - it has maintained consistency, contrary to your suggestion. Overwatch has had disappointing numbers, there have been two Smash Brothers games since Melee, yet Melee is the most played, and the FGC plays multiple games to begin with. In addition, multi-game franchises like Team Liquid, Cloud 9, Optic Gaming, and others help prevent any potential tumultuous change in the market anyway and will provide a new stable familiar fan base in any new esport to come to popularity.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","I'm a huge pokemon fan, somewhere between ""casual"" and ""hardcore"". For example, I don't know what EVs and IVs do exactly, but I sure know they exist! 

I've been playing Pokemon since gen 1, I've enjoyed every generation, and a lot of the spinoff games. I watch the anime. I think my favorite main line games are HGSS and SM.

I'm not getting either of the Let's Go games. I didn't play Pokemon Go either. When the first announcement trailer for Pokemon Go came out, I was over the moon excited. But as more information came out, I found that fears I didn't even know I had about Pokemon were being realized. I don't mind a game without battling (I love trozei, ranch, etc), but it felt like Pokemon Go betrayed what is, in my view, the emotional core of Pokemon: the mutually beneficial bond of friendship between people and pokemon.  I'll explain.

In the main pokemon games, you catch pokemon, and form a team, and keep them with you through a journey. From Yellow onward, it felt like really making friends. There are small rewards for collecting every species, but you don't have to, and are encouraged to just use you favorites. Before you get your first pokemon, you can't walk into the tall grass, because it's too dangerous - a pokemon might attack you. It's a small detail, but it made the pokemon world feel like a dangerous place, where pokemon fighting is a natural part of the ecosystem. That's confirmed when you get your first pokemon, and wander into the grass, and you get attacked. Your pokemon keeps you safe, and you heel it, and care for it. You become friends, and it's great.

In Pokemon Go, and Let's Go, the world feels different. Pokemon don't attack you. They stand around, and then you capture them. They only fight when people make them fight. I know it's the same world, and I'm not one of those ""Pokemon is like dogfighting"" people, but that difference in mechanics really makes the game feel different. I feel like Niantec really failed to understand what makes pokemon great, as evidenced by the Candy mechanic. You catch pokemon, and then throw them away if they aren't strong enough. Literally in the anime, that's how they show that Paul is a bad guy. Pokemon Go makes you play as Paul from the Diamond and Pearl Anime, and I refuse to be Paul. Pokemon Let's Go looks a little better, but the Go line of games just makes me feel like the people who make Pokemon don't understand why I fell in love with the series in the first place.

I never want to wish failure on a game - a lot of talented, passionate people are working on these games, and a lot of people are finding a lot of happiness in these games. But I'm worried that if these do better than the more recent main line games, or the game(s) releasing next year, the series might move more toward mechanics that subtly make me feel like the game wants me to roleplay Paul from the anime, and I don't think I could stomach that. Thanks for reading my wall of text, and, if you plan on palying Let's Go, I hope you enjoy it, and forge new and long lasting bonds of friendship with your Pokemon!",1533081746

Protest.

What you've said is ""I'm only comfortable with defending democracy when it's comfortable.""

The Civil Rights Era protests put health and safety on the line because tearing down racist laws was more important than the risk of injury. The marches we have had were just that. They weren't protests. A protest occupies a valuable space and forces the authority to act, generally meaning mass arrests. Then you sue over mistreatment, abuse of authority, and any other way to tie up the court to show that you as a citizen are fundamentally opposed to an unconstitutional law or action. A protest at the very least is a large inconvenience. 

We need to be protesting the GOP at their homes, businesses, and offices. We need to protest any Democrat who is unwilling to back their constituents in the fight against alt-right fascism. 

Democracy is even more important than desegregation. We could not have had the latter without the former. We have a long history of incremental improvements in human rights but we as the citizens must push ourselves and our government to be better.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I don't often post here but my first advice is never to break up. 

You should break up with her. She has crossed a line where she says things in the heat of the moment purely to hurt you. She betrayed that trust of you telling her something and then used it against you. That, in my book, is the biggest thing. 

Secondly, you do not have to feel attraction to people who are bigger regardless of your current relationship to them. Different things tickle pickles. Being big isn't on your list. The fact that you've brought it up to her multiple times showed that you attempted andshe is refusing to change. Alright, thats her choice. Doesn't mean you're cucumber is gonna grow from infertile soil. 

I suggest you just go do you but away from her. ",1533081748

Firstly it was Ancient Greek mathematician Euclid who discovered and described the reflection of light..
http://www.thestargarden.co.uk/Reflection-refraction-and-diffraction.html
300 BCE 
Ibn al-Haytham lived 1300 years after.. 

Roman astronomer Ptolemy expanded the theories of Euclid also.. long before this ‚Äòibn‚Äô did anything the poster above ‚Äòclaims‚Äô.

As for trigonometry.. The father is Hipparchus... Greek astronomer 190-120 bc. 

As for co-sines? lol that was Euclid again. Dating back to 3rd century BC. Its called Euclids Elements.

&gt; Though the notion of the cosine was not yet developed in his time, Euclid's Elements, dating back to the 3rd century BC, contains an early geometric theorem almost equivalent to the law of cosines. 

Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ worked of Euclid's theorems. So please trying to attribute more than what they did. If we went around claiming all the things western culture has done.. The list would be never ending. Muslim contributions to mathematics, is no surprise however.. The numerical language, was never banned by muslim faiths, like other works of science are using foreign alphabets. Indeed numbers in them selves are 'arabic' in origin... And predate the muslim religion.


Muslims across the world, have translated less books and science into Arabic than Spain into Spanish alone across the world.

The Muslim faith, values one book, above all the Quran.

Even the Quran and Hadiths states that girls over 12 should not be allowed an education. 

So you are really going back a long way historically to find any form of ‚Äòcontribition‚Äô. 

So maybe.. how about you give me one recent female? Half the population at a minimum is oppressed till this day..  Where are the Marie curries of the Islamist world?",1533081749

"DMAcademy","t5_3f611","I can't answer for tomb, but I can answer some.

It should tell you a level to start at, I think they give recommendations for a few different levels (1/5/10)

What you have listed should be plenty for a first time group, monster manual and phb being most important the rest are just helpful for the most part. If you are somewhat crafty and haven't bought the map already you can make one for super cheap laminated and all. If the players don't have their own dice ife at least buy 2 sets.

The players handbook give you everything you will need to know about making a character , including starting gears and how many spell slots and spells a player will have at every level. Spells are usually chosen by the player, and some are given to the class as you level I believe. (Have never made a caster so not 100%)

On a side note, if you have an extra 20 bucks and are unsure about tomb of annihilation, the starter set gives all the basic rules, a set of dice, and a nice little Campaign for first time players that is great for a first time DM to learn from. Good luck and welcome to the hobby!",1533081749

Isn't it also common knowledge that protein shakes are consumed specifically for muscle-building protein as part of a diet? Like how do you somehow glaze over everything your doctors have told you about babies, forget the fact that protein shakes are a meal supplement to build muscle, and think 'hmmm, protein shake is better than breastmilk.

I like it a lot more than other newgame+ games like Chrono Trigger and stuff.  RS2 even reminds me a little of Phantasy Star III and Suikoden, but of course very different. 

plus the latest version has new game+, so even those that feel stuck power up, though I didn't have to resort to new game+ to complete RS2.   it has multiple saves and I made good use of backup saves.

"bayarea","t5_2qjyy","&gt;You're overlooking one simple thing (again) and that's that rent control in the bay area is the only thing helping some people hold on. I never said it was good for the housing economy. I never denied the downsides. I merely appealed to the benefits.

And you're overlooking one simple thing (again), and that's whether or not that's a good thing, for either those families, or the area?

I fully expect to come back to find a bunch of naked appeals to emotion, telling me why I'm a terrible human for even thinking of this, but seriously:  People don't always get what they want.  Not everyone is going to be able to afford to live in an extremely desirable area with limited housing and high expenses.  Under normal circumstances, if you can't afford to live someplace, you move to someplace you can afford.  And that's... reasonable?

Anyway, we're drifting quite a ways afield.  The original conversation was ""in what ways does rent-control"" screw people currently being protected by it?  Well, I've given you several.  (Makes their initial prices higher, and their service lower.)  It might *also* offer them some apparent short-term benefits, by making their costs decrease more slowly, in exchange for higher upfront costs, worse service, and being generally bad for the area as a whole.",1533081751

"Kingman","t5_2rzw2","**Don't blame Sacha Baron Cohen because you don't like the truth**

We are currently seeing another example of that with comedian Sacha Baron Cohen and his new Showtime series, ""Who is America?""  The first three episodes of the show have sparked outrage by some who Cohen ""duped"" into sharing their bigoted views or in which he reminded us of their past misconduct. True, Cohen was disguised as different characters when he spoke to these people. But by hiding his identity, he simply made them feel comfortable to express their true feelings.

For example, in the show's second episode, a disguised Cohen presented a faux plan to build a mega-mosque to a group of people in Kingman, a small town in Arizona. The attendees responded with comments such as: ""I'm racist toward Muslims"" and ""He's saying there's black people in Kingman that aren't welcome there, either, but we tolerate them.""

Did Cohen take advantage of them? Nope, Cohen, through his comedy, simply allowed them to show us who they are.

Kingman Mayor Monica Gates told CNN's Brooke Baldwin on Friday those comments don't represent the residents of her town. ""We are a diverse, welcoming and embracing community,"" Gates said.  ""And to the extent that prejudice and racism does exist in every community, we will take strides to ensure that we educate and bring our community together.""

On Sunday's episode, Alabama's Roy Moore, who lost his bid for the US Senate last December in part because of allegations of improper sexual misconduct with teenage girls, was outraged that an undercover Cohen highlighted those claims in a comedic segment. Moore, who stormed out mid-interview, slammed the comedian in a statement afterward, ""As for Mr. Cohen, whose art is trickery, deception and dishonesty, Alabama does not respect cowards who exhibit such traits!"" If Moore was so concerned about having those allegations being raised again, maybe he shouldn't be doing on-camera interviews ‚Äî especially with people he doesn't know!

Comedians under fire

The reality is that the truth can hurt, even when wrapped in a punchline. There's no better example of that today than Donald J. Trump.  Just a few weeks ago, the 45th President of the United States was so triggered by late-night comedians mocking him that he lashed out at three of them by name, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon and Jimmy Kimmel, at a campaign rally.

But Trump has done more than whine about comedians treating him ""unfairly."" He even took to Twitter just a month before the 2016 election demanding that ""Saturday Night Live"" be canceled because, as he put it, the show did a ""hit job on me.""  In reality, the iconic late-night show had comedically (and accurately) depicted Trump's hypocrisy concerning the rash of sexual assault claims that had been leveled against him at the time. Alec Baldwin, as Trump, demanded the victims of Bill Clinton's alleged sexual misconduct ""need to be respected and their voices need to be heard."" But when asked about the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, ""Trump"" shot back: ""They need to shut the hell up.""

But Trump lashing out at comedians is nothing compared to what happened to comedy legend Lenny Bruce.  Incredibly, Bruce was arrested not once but eight times for ""obscene"" jokes he told at nightclubs. Bruce's lawyer at the time argued rightly that the comedian was actually being prosecuted for his jokes mocking those in power, as well as ridiculing religion.  But that didn't stop Bruce from being convicted in 1964 for violating New York's obscenity laws and being sentenced to hard labor.

Think about that for a moment: A comedian was sentenced to hard labor for telling jokes that upset those in power.  As one of the New York district attorneys who prosecuted Bruce's case later candidly revealed, ""We drove him into poverty and bankruptcy and then murdered him. We all knew what we were doing. We used the law to kill him."" Bruce tragically died of a morphine overdose while the appeal to this conviction was pending.

The 'Jon Stewart of Egypt'

And the fear that some in power have about comedians revealing the truth is not limited to the United States. Bassem Youssef, who is referred to as the ""Jon Stewart of Egypt,"" found that out the hard way.  In 2013, Youssef's jokes mocking then-President Mohamed Morsi led to his arrest. (I bet Trump wishes he could do that to American comedians!) Fortunately, Youssef was freed the same day and was able to continue to host his wildly popular ""Daily Show""-esque comedy show on Egyptian television.

But after Morsi was replaced by current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in 2014, it became clear that Youssef's brand of comedic truth-telling would no longer be permitted in Egypt. Consequently, Youssef was forced to flee his homeland for the safety of himself and his family and he now lives in exile in the United States. (Youssef recently joked to me that living in the United States under Trump is easy for him because he was raised in a dictatorship.)

Comedy is inherently subversive.  It can reveal bigotry and challenge people in power. And comedy can reveal truths that some don't like.  For those upset by the jokes, change the channel, or don't click on the videos.

Or better yet, stop whining and start laughing.

The reality is that they'll never be able to silence these rebels with a comedic cause who are armed to the teeth with punchlines ‚Äî so they might as well enjoy a few laughs.

Ironically you would understand this if you had actually finished the video - it's not a sin that you didn't but in Dunkey's case, he defined it as such:

"" Tetracyclines chelate calcium in teeth and bones; they become incorporated into these structures, inhibit calcification (eg, hypoplastic dental enamel), and cause yellowish then brownish discoloration. At extremely high concentrations, the healing processes in fractured bones is impaired. ""

so i know this doesn't specifically say that its bad for juveniles, but young animals are always going to be more susceptible to developmental contraindications than adults - simply because they are still developing.

just a thought - and again, i have no idea if this contraindication would even cross over to affect birds in the same way, or even if its a contraindication to really worry about, as it does report that it is ""extremely high doses"" that causes this!  thanks for bringing it up though - its always nice to get a little reading in and get a refresher on drug stuff! :)",1533081757

"openwrt","t5_2rpqd","The final release of 18.06.0 is now available on the downloads site, and it turns out you're in luck. Using [this file]
(https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/18.06.0/targets/ar71xx/generic/openwrt-18.06.0-ar71xx-generic-archer-c7-v2-squashfs-factory-us.bin) (sha256: 2a5a4b300d0f683df7556f910535c03f4c993965c9f00ec02570ce97888bde4f), you can go directly from the pre-installed TP-Link US firmware to 18.06.0 final. Yo no longer have to jump through any of the hoops that we talked about, because that OpenWRT firmware file includes the US region code header that the TP-Link firmware uploader looks for (same thing DD-WRT was using to be installable).

My source for this new information is the Archer C7 device page on the OpenWRT wiki:

&gt; Recent versions (late 2015 and newer) of TP-Link routers sold in the United States will not upgrade firmware through the OEM firmware web interface unless the header includes the US region code.
&gt;
&gt; **As of r49217 trunk now includes the necessary US region header in the v2 firmware file**, currently other regions accept this firmware as only the US region firmware is locked. Once trunk is installed you can install any firmware. You can also flash any firmware image using the TFTP Recovery method to install OpenWrt.

Emphasis mine. The change apparently happened in 2016, but that was after I had first installed OpenWrt, so I never knew about the change.

Note: For anyone reading this in the future, use the factory **US** file for whatever the current version of OpenWRT is for the Archer C7 v2. Factory alone won't work, but Factory US will.",1533081757

Edit 2:  So, this still doesn‚Äôt make very much sense.

In other words, you‚Äôre far too focused on that one issue (drugs) to see the bigger picture. The idea that all prosecutors are evil simply for doing their jobs in that context is, quite honestly, presumptuous enough that I don‚Äôt feel the need to address it any further. 

Moreover, it‚Äôs not the job of prosecutors to *write the laws*.  They literally couldn‚Äôt if they wanted to.

"RugbyTraining","t5_2ymz1","Rucking is basically a game of how-low-can-you-go. When your cleaning out players, the ideal way to do it is to get under their chest and then rise up like a plane taking off. You're getting between them and the ball while also allowing yourself to get at their legs to destabilise them. 

I'm 6'2"" and always found it a nightmare trying to get under smaller players once they'd latched over the ball to steal it. The only other legal way to clean them out was to try grab behind their armpits and twist them off the ball and refs don't even like players doing that now because it can lead to neck rolls if done incorrectly. 

You can get even lower by putting your knees on the tackled player when your stealing for support. It's technically illegal but you'll get the odd ref who ignores it and it stops the other teams players from taking your legs out. David Pocock does it the whole time for Australia. Basically try it at one ruck and see what the ref thinks.

With regards to the second question around mauls, yeah you do have to wait in case a hooker or no.8 comes running off the back of it. 

When I played 7, I liked to hang off the maul to the side if I wasn't needed and wait til someone carried the ball or the maul collapsed. Once that happens, you can run in and try get over the ball again and steal it. Usually everyone else is on a heap on the ground so its a great chance to nick the ball if its not to close to the try-line.

If the maul sets up where you are in the lineout, try to get your arms under the ball and hold the ball-carrier up while facing your own try-line. Doing that stops them getting them ball back and gets you between him and his supporting players. If he doesn't get the ball back your team gets a turnover and a scrum.

*****
&gt; LAS VEGAS - College basketball recruiting as we know it will soon look very different if significant new NCAA rule changes are approved as expected.

&gt; After possible changes to recruiting rules were originally rebuked by coaches in recent weeks, significant revamps to the NCAA rulebook and calendar are on the precipice of becoming official, with the traditional/coveted July live period looking decidedly different starting in 2019.

&gt; At this point, the likelihood of college basketball recruiting ever going back to having three live weekends with non-scholastic tournaments that coaches can attend in July is extremely low.

Let me put this into some perspective for you. My daily driver is an i7-7700k with 32GB of RAM and a GTX 1070 that I typically run games in ultra on at 2560x1080.

For a YouTube channel I just launched, I did a series where I show people how to build a computer, install Windows on it, and gave benchmark results 

That computer I used on YouTube was a Pentium G4560 with 8GB of RAM and a GTX 1050.  I wasted a bunch of time I should have used benchmarking because Doom and GTA V are still just as fun at high/medium settings at around 80fps as they are on ultra over 100fps.

The difference between those computers is roughly $1,400. The i7 doesn't make me $1,400 happier.",1533081762

"WeddingPhotography","t5_2rdee","I collected a bunch of cut and paste from online samples, then went in and had my lawyer help me piece it together.  It's a HUGE topic, and the language is SUPER important.  If you word something wrong, you'll lose in court if it's ever challenged.  So, even as someone who is a bit of a legal enthusiast, I think it's outside of total DIY territory.

The most important things she straightened out were - 

Venue selection and limit of damages - a paragraph that articulates that if we have a disagreement about the contract terms, fulfillment, or payment, the disagreement will be settled in small claims or superior court in MY city, the damages will be limited to the forfeiture or refund of the contract price, and acknowledgement that we'll each pay our own legal fees during such a suit.    This clause specifically spells out that it governs CONTRACT disputes.   It obviously doesn't limit liability suits if one of us gets hurt, and it doesn't control copyright issues as those have to be brought in federal court. 

Copyright and licensing - a clause that politely makes it clear that I own the photos, and grant them, upon full payment, a license to share, print, and display them.   It reserves commercial rights, including publication and sub licensing.

Expectations - Mine makes it clear that I will provide a 'curated and edited gallery' - meaning that NO you won't get the raws.  It sets deadlines for delivery and describes the deliverables in plain terms so they know what they're getting and what they're not.

Most importantly, perhaps - deposits and liquidated damage provisions.   According to my lawyer, if you copied your contract from a template, you almost CERTAINLY will lose in court if someone sues you to get their deposit back.   This is because - the words deposit and retainer are legally interpreted, most places, to mean 'an advance against future work.'  If you end up NOT doing that work, you are NOT entitled to keep the deposit, no matter what your contract claimed.  IF you actually want a nonrefundable deposit, you either need to structure that as a 'booking fee' or add a liquidated damages provision, that explains that cancelling the contract hurts you, and instead of haggling about it, you both agree in advance that cancelling before 60 days you'll be compensated with the deposit, and within 60 days you'll be owed the full sum.  Deposits and retainers are 'earned' when you shoot the wedding, so if the wedding is next year, they go on next year's taxes.   Booking fees are earned when you write their name on your calendar, so they go on this year's taxes.  Liquidated damages are 'earned' when you are notified of the cancellation, so they could end up on either year's taxes, depending.

Teams only want your players when they can help them win a World Series. Players who are 2 year removed from decent seasons, and currently having shit seasons, have no value to teams wanting to win. 

Machado was a FA after this year. Britton was a FA after this year. We weren‚Äôt going to pay either of them. 

Schoop is a FA in 2 seasons. Gausman 3. 

*Even with* our Star short stop who is one of the top players in the MLB, we were on pace for one of the worst seasons in our franchises history. What makes you think we would have been competitive in the next few years with Schoop and Gausman? 

Spoiler: we wouldn‚Äôt have been. 

This needed to happen. It should have happened 2 years ago when we were a boarderline WC team. We‚Äôd have the Padres farm system right now with incredible talent and a promising future. Instead, you‚Äôre right, we will not he competitive until 2022 at least.

One trick I used that worked wonders was hanging some crafting canvas in the corner of my aquarium directly under my light. It was right by my overflow, but you could put it near a filter or powerhead and that should work too. The diatoms liked the surface because it was easy to cling to. I'd just rinse the crafting canvas in the sink any time I noticed brownish build up on it.

I wouldn't recommend changing your tank stock to deal with diatoms. They're only a short term problem and aren't harmful to fish. They won't even bother plants unless the plants can't get adequate light (I lost a sword plant, but none of my other plants suffered). ",1533081765

To be blunt, I think some people see it as a child has a whole life to be lived while an old or sick person has basically gotten their chance. This is not what I believe, but I'm sure some people rationalize it this way. In the end, you were talking to parents for whom that child is the center of their universe. Maybe they are myopic.

For every nurse who actually appreciates feedback and takes it to heart, you've got another who'll take it as a personal attack and proceed to be a pain for the doctor.  

&gt;On the other hand, I've rounded on patients in the ICU whose A-line says 70/50 (57), where I have to go find the nurse and ask her ""how long has this been like this!?"" and she says, ""it's been like this since the start of my shift"" So I nicely tell her that we usually target a MAP of 65 and that the patient is normally hypertensive in the 140s so a pressure like this is not ok for her.

I always feel like it‚Äôs me stressing myself out about it returning as those were some symptoms that had happened originally but anxiety can trigger your worse fears and put pains in the spots you fear the most. I‚Äôve had just about every test in the book done when it comes to the heart ( I‚Äôm 25 and recently gotten into good shape) and they can‚Äôt find anything wrong with my cardiac health.

I‚Äôm not a doctor but for you and myself you have to reassure yourself that if your young, healthy and take care of yourself that it could be stress and a bunch of other things (non cardiac related) that could be causing it. There are days were I‚Äôm full blown not okay and my heart is beating a billion beats a minute, my left arm is hurting, my chest is hurting, legs are twitching and your mind convinced yourself it‚Äôs something to do with your heart. Everyday I think I‚Äôm going to have a heart attack, yet I‚Äôm here and it‚Äôs 2018, almost three years after my incident.

You be the judge of that: if you construct a frontend around your backend and you start to notice that querying dom nodes out of div soups, managing events and updating views with innerHtml gets tiring, then of course, use a view layer that'll make that process simpler and re-usable.

"MemeEconomy","t5_3gl3k","I support your viewpoint here dude, but this argument is such a difficult one to have. I don't think anyone here is saying that it's impossible to have racial prejudice against a race in a position of power (white in this case). Clearly you can hold these prejudices, for example the word cracker in this picture, or commonly used jokes about how white people can't dance or aren't as good in bed or similar. 

The argument very quickly becomes whether or not you are ""allowed"" to call racial prejudice against the privileged race *racism* or not. I personally am inclined to say that *racism* in general implies that power dynamic, but others prefer to say that all racial prejudice is racism, and the power dynamic becomes *institutional racism*. 

Neither definition is inherently correct because that's how language works, but people keep misinterpreting the other side. The reason I lean towards the side of the argument I do is that dealing with ""institutional racism"" has so much more importance than racial prejudice (institutional oppression is more significant than someone assuming that you can't dance), and distinguishing clearly between those situations seems important to me. But I don't think anyone who prefers to distinguish between racism in general and institutional racism disagrees that institutional racism is more significant,  so the argument just gets pointless very quickly.

I hope that was clear, I didn't intend to attack either side. ",1533081771

Also, since headliners play against each other, they tend to try and get ones of different genres for the same night.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","&gt;So please, if you guys could explain to me what about it you hate so much, I would greatly appreciate it. 

* **nothing happens**, the overall story/plot isn't progressed sure there's a very TINY amount of character development, but on characters I personally do no care about (those being the new characters, they have no story still, in the films that is, I'm not paying $50 to buy a bunch of comics and books to read their character development,put that shit in the film.

*  **I was already disappointed with episode 7 having gone into it hoping to see Luke Skywalker**, especially since he talks in the trailer(has no lines in the film)only for him to be the last 10 seconds of film with no lines,**To then have to wait 2 years more, 5 year wait at this point, to be told**

* **""prepare to be fuckin subverted motha fucka!""** this angered me, I had built my hopes up that they could do a new story that would at least be as grand as the story they threw out
**instead I got art school ""deconstruction"" and ""subversion"" of everything I had been looking forwards to.**

* **they weaponized hyperspace.
so from this point onward you are going to need a very good reason as to why that maneuver is no longer available.**

* DJ does nothing but spout 5 lines the entire film, rose preaches the same dull mundane cringe crap at every chance she gets about how she has it so bad, and how the kids on the planet they go to have it bad, 
**she then sets loose the dog horses instead of the kids**

* The theme of star wars should never be unrelenting failure
**especially when your saving grace is someone that you already know to be dead 12 months before premier.**

* lukes final fight was crap and over in seconds, kylo still wildly swings around without any finesse despite finishing his training.

* the throne room fight was a bit dull considering there was no chance of the two main characters being killed off in the second act of a three act story.

* Snoke was a massive let down, CG Andy hasn't been back to set so Snoke really was meant to be a red herring (really those suck and are a very pixar/disney thing to do lately)

**controversial thought but carries slurring caused a lot of headaches for the cast and crew during ep7 though since shes now nothing short of a martyr you cant mention this fact, still I will, she was akin to Bella Lugosi's final days as portrayed in Ed Wood, old,infirm and although full of anger also hopelessly beyond the point of no return mostly confined to a chair or written into a coma, her character was needlessly kept alive in the film.**

* **the new characters** Rey is not an interesting character neither is Finn Rose, Maz,Holdo,New Leia,Snoke,DJ and even new luke. 

* **Poe and Kylo are the only characters with actual goals**, poe is trying to save his side in a battle, Kylo is trying to find Luke, snoke just sits on his ass, leia sits on her ass most of the film, luke sits on his ass, holdo sits on her ass, its like the fonz came in and said ""sit on it!"" to the whole cast.


* **super sayan leia** why not this is the film that said the force is not about moving rocks, but thats all rey does, the force is available to everyone now, but leia has not been seen using it before only to be more powerful than her brother ever was.",1533081772

"CarWraps","t5_2wzjg","Hey. Textured plastic is a bane of the wrap industry. It looks nasty post wrap, it has low surface energy lowering adhesion and unless properly sealed causes all sorts of edge problems. We use a Hi-Tack vinyl for all our interior or textured plastic work.

Depending on what look you are going for, you can use a thicker film that will go someway of evening out the effect. The 3M Di-Noc range is a good example. It's got an aggressive adhesive that should negate the low surface energy and it's quite thick. It's also available in a huge range of textures and finishes. Worth checking out.

In regards to the mirror, surface prep is the biggest difference between a good wrap and an average wrap. If the paint is flaking in one spot, good chance it's going to flake elsewhere causing a bad finish and huge amounts of frustration. A good way to quickly test this would be the masking tape test. Put some masking tape down, heat it, let it cool and the rip it off. If it takes paint, the wrap will take paint. My suggestion would be a solid cut and polish if you can and then bog fill with a paintable filler. I say paintable because some fillers have silicon and other additives that will lower surface energy and adhesion. The smoother the finish the better the result. Allow the filler the FULL curing time mentioned on the bottle, plus a few hours to be sure before wraping.",1533081773

&gt;Quite a long time before the Korean War, the U.S. had been 'interested' in Korea. After WWII, the U.S. pushed ahead with preparations to take the areas which were occupied by Japan and the fascist allies. The hope was to seize strategic bridgeheads for attack of Russia, world domination, and also for colonisation of economy, because of the catastrophic economic crisis the U.S. had experienced starting in 1948.
&gt;the U.S. created a so-called 'northward expedition' plan to invade the DPRK, according to which its military operations to provoke the Korean War would be launched by August 1949. Its main attack focused in the west of Korea, and its secondary one at the east of Korea. This plan was delayed till August, because U.S. troops in Japan and the south Korean armed forces were not prepared to carry it forward, and because of strong anti-American sentiment in south Korea. Even before the outbreak of the Korean War, the U.S. insisted that they would need 100,000 modernised armed forces to invade northern Korea, and so they strengthened south Korea's arms build up as much as possible. In 1949, the south Korea army was reinforced into eight divisions and twenty-two regiments and its number totaled - guess what? - 100,000. To strengthen the south Korean armed forces as quickly as possible, the US sent advanced weapons, tanks, ships, etc. to south Korea. This amounted to $190,000,000 by 1949. They also built up ports and airdomes, set up military bases everwhere, dug trenches and built pillboxes along the area of the 38th parallel. All of this was just before the Korean War. While thus preparing for war, they continued armed assaults on the area north of the 38th parallel to provoke a war. The number of such armed provocations was 2,617 in 1949 alone. The number of armed provovations was at its highest in 1950

You could be kind of an ass about it and tell her that you are happy to babysit, but that every time you do, you are going to teach him something new, and if she doesn't want that, then she needs to find a different babysitter. Watch her head explode. :)",1533081775

Bitterness or sourness is from the *extraction* process, a.k.a how many flavors you are pulling from the coffee beans via the interaction with hot water.  Extraction is affected by grind size (smaller grind = more surface area = faster extraction), brew time (longer brew time = more time for the hot water to extract flavors), water temperature (hotter water = faster extraction), and technique (how and where you pour).

Too high extraction = Bitter

Too low extraction = Sour

What happened? It's easy to say right wing propaganda, and in some ways be correct, but what misstep(s) got us here? I'd love to write a book on that.

I'd venture to guess that taking union workers for granted. Assuming we didn't have to earn their votes. The Hard Hat Riots in 1970 were a weathervane IMO.

Anyways, by you stating there's nothing healthy about coercive monopolies it's blatantly incorrect. For example, the benefits of Standard Oil in the country was only realized after it had built a nationwide infrastructure that no longer depended on trains and their notoriously fluctuating costs, a leap that would help reduce costs and the overall price of petroleum products after the company was dismantled. The size of Standard Oil allowed it to undertake projects that disparate companies could never agree on and, in that sense, it was as beneficial as state-regulated utilities for developing the U.S. into an industrial nation. 

Now I do agree with having competition in our market, as I advocate for that, but I'm simply stating some facts that goes against your arguments that you have show very little sources to support it.

"bristol","t5_2r52c","First off, i would highly recommend looking up screen repair on youtube. I recently smashed my screen on an obscure chinese android model, and found several videos detailing the process to take the phone apart etc. And i only ended up having to pay ¬£20 for a new screen via ebay, then repaired it myself (first time i'd done this), and it works like new.

All you will really need for replacing a screen, is a plastic prying tool and a screwdriver (if you order a new screen, they usually come with these tools).

¬£200 is an absolute joke, no question about that. You shouldn't be paying anything more than ¬£25 labour for a 30 minute job, and most phone lcd's cost no more than ¬£30. So give that about ¬£50 total for a screen repair.

The S6 is a very popular phone model, so no doubt there are plenty of video tutorials on youtube, i would honestly highly recommend looking into it, and seeing if you feel confident in trying to repair it manually. As long as you catalogue which screws you are removing etc, and remember where ribbon cables should connect to, it should be a 30 minute job that anyone can do.

EDIT; although for some reason, samsung lcd's seem to have extortionate prices around ¬£60-80 on ebay. That's odd, because most other phones are less than half that cost... but still... [even at about ¬£70](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/A-LCD-Touch-Screen-Glass-Digitizer-For-Samsung-Galaxy-S6-G920-G920F-G920A-Blue/311846242445?epid=25005559778&amp;hash=item489b7c088d:g:clQAAOSwrddY7zlC) you'll be saving a lot of money if you can repair it yourself following a video such as this, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXperoxt89E , and that ebay listing i linked does come with the required tools. Just thought i'd point this out in case you feel confident enough to try it yourself, as it will really save you a lot of money, and is pretty straight forward.",1533081781

Another 1/3 of the time is printers being replaced without testing the pages work. (OMG ‚Äúit works on Windows‚Äù, if I never hear that again)  USB printers are TERRIBLE with AS/400 stuff. They just plain don‚Äôt work. Proper hardware-included PCL support is a must. Go to the IBM site and find ‚ÄúPrinters From Various Manufactures‚Äù.

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","What does your speaker say?  Does it say St. Louis Music on it anywhere?  Or SLM?  Eminence?  Or something else all together?

If my memory is correct, a lot of the budget brand amps had SLM speakers and some of the older ones/higher end ones had Eminence speakers.

The manual says you should have x1 12"" 4 ohm speaker in the unit.  Here's the manual (you probably already looked for this).

https://ampeg.com/pdf/manuals/BA_OM.pdf

What I would do would be to call back their CS line and get a BOM or parts list that has descriptions of the speaker.  Maybe even see if they can give you a spec sheet of the speaker itself.  I used to provide these on occasion.  You can give a few dealerships a call or find Ampeg service centers and talk to a warranty parts tech.  Some of them may give you a cold treatment as they'd rather have you pay them to replace it but if you explain yourself a lot of guys in the industry are pretty cool and may give you some good tips.

If you bought the amp for $100 it may cost just as much or maybe a little more to replace that speaker.  You may be able to hit e-bay if you get OEM PN#'s or other information that can relate the parts and get a better deal.

That $2759 also included as many options as I could find that *could* have been a part of your build that I couldn't see like $150 chambering, and assumed a tung oiled neck and satin finished body which was the most expensive configuration that would make sense since the body isn't painted,and also assumed gold EVO frets, and while I couldn't make it out in the photo, I assumed the most expensive logo option.

"gamedesign","t5_2qimq","Not sure what the references you got say, but I' have an idea about this: setting up a piggy bank to fill with spare change when you complete a task in real life. Then, once you have enough ""XP"", you can cash out for anything you want.

My problem with gamification programs is that they often attempt to reward you by giving you access to something you already have access to (like, going for a jog would net you 10 minutes of TV time... or you could just stay home and watch TV anyways). By setting up a fund, not only does it not feel like you're missing out on something (it's just spare change after all, I'm not going to cry over a dime) but it rewards you with a nice prize that you wouldn't have gotten if you found all that change in your couch and decided to deposit it. Plus, it's a good motivator and a good visual reference on how far you've come and how far you need to go.

You're simply wrong.  The people that rail against the progressive tax scheme as unfair are those who actually pay the bulk of the taxes, and don't just receive taxpayer benefits from those who actually produce.


I'm not even going to bother to address your ""we all pay the same percentage"" horseshit.  The successful are gouged by the tax man and you know it.


&gt; Perhaps there's a compromise though. Let's treat capital gains just exactly like we treat income and scale it similarly. While it's equal under the law as it is, it would be considerably more fair if we did so.

Directly from the post (below). I interpret this statement as implying although taxes might increase (for example) $1,000, one would not longer need to pay (for example) $3,000 in private healthcare copays/deductible/premiums, leading to a net-benefit saving of $2,000. I would also be interested in the effect on quality, though other countries have shown to be able to provide universal healthcare while being on par with US healthcare quality.

*****
&gt; American Airlines and Citi have just launched a credit card that will be particularly attractive to those new to the miles- and points-earning game.

&gt; Why? The new AA credit card allows you to earn miles easily, while eliminating that pesky annual fee that sometimes turns off a lot of potential new cardholders.

&gt; &amp;quot;As a new approach to support everyday spending, we&amp;#039;re excited to offer a different type of credit card in partnership with American Airlines - one that enables cardmembers to earn more miles and travel rewards through trips to the supermarket,&amp;quot; said Valerie Greer, head of co-brand partnerships, Citi Cards.

The ones with an additional bass knob or a bass, middle, treble knob are supposed to be nice because when you stomp on it you don't lose all your low end. This is especially nice for playing at different volumes and practicing at low volume. 

I don't use a proper ts type pedal myself, I use an old vox tonelab, but when I use the built in tubescreamer I always set a separate patch to account for the loss in low end because it drives me nuts. From what I have read this is a common complaint with tubescreamer type pedals.

I like the klon setting on my tonelab too but find I use it with a humbucker guitar way more where as the tubescreamer I use with my strat. Just my preference. I think the tubescreamer and klon have different types of clipping. One is asymmetric and one is symmetric or something like that. 

I think the klons may be more sensitive to finger pressure volume, distorting more with increased attack while the tubescreamer is more of a guitar volume knob roll on to increase distortion type of deal.

Water temperature - I know I'm a bit barbaric here, but I use a saucepan with a pour lip.  I put the same amount of water in it, bring to a good boil, then pull off the heat for a specified time (1 minute in my case).  Works fine for my Aeropress and bean.  Your timing might vary, depending on what temperature you want to hit, and how variable the temperatures are in your house (winter vs. summer, for instance).

Bean - different beans have different densities, so you need to have a ""standard"" there.  I have a level (a crossmember) on the inside of my grinder that I fill to, and it's consistent enough for my taste.  But if I were to change beans, especially if I change from medium to light or dark, it would be time to weigh the beans or begin experimenting with amounts and spend several cups fiddling with adjusting the level of bean in the grinder.  But a decent 0.1 gram scale is pretty cheap (AWS 2 kg. capacity often recommended here, I have an equivalent that is more than adequate).  I haven't used my scale for Aeropress for months, though I use it every time for weighing my espresso grind.

Most people call it pedophilia for an 'adult' male to fuck an underage female, regardless of her being 17 and underage of 15 and underage, because they have erroneously tied pedophilia to 'breaking age of consent law', and to 'teens', when it is neither.

But it has become a cultural meme and people, who do no investigation of their own, take it as absolutely faithful truth, and then perpetuate it when these kinds of events of the footballer and the 15 year old occur. They're informed incorrectly by their faith-based acceptance and thus treat someone as something they're not.

I hope you find it unjust to treat people as more evil or more good than they are, to dehumanize some people for mob claims against them (like the duke lacrosse 'rapists' who were basically harassed for a long period of their lives by a mob, because if its mob harassment, then its okay, but individual harassment is totally illegal and wrong, think about that), or to reject treating truly bad people as bad.",1533081790

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","I can‚Äôt find what he posted (evidently the law prohibits police from publicly releasing that information), but here‚Äôs what I could find about the Communications Act itself. 

&gt; On 19 December 2012, to strike a balance between freedom of speech and criminality, the Director of Public Prosecutions issued interim guidelines, clarifying when social messaging is eligible for criminal prosecution under UK law. Only communications that are credible threats of violence, harassment, or stalking (such as aggressive Internet trolling) which specifically targets an individual or individuals, or breaches a court order designed to protect someone (such as those protecting the identity of a victim of a sexual offence) will be prosecuted. Communications that express an ""unpopular or unfashionable opinion about serious or trivial matters, or banter or humour, even if distasteful to some and painful to those subjected to it"" will not. Communications that are merely ""grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false"" will be prosecuted only when it can be shown to be necessary and proportionate.

Not quite the same as ‚Äúrude.‚Äù And seeing as there are often rape threats posted on twitter without any consequence in the US, it‚Äôs hard to argue that such a law isn‚Äôt necessary.

That being said I won't try to convince you to stay, but I also won't say you need to get out either.  Everyone needs something different out of life, what works for one will not work for another. If you still value what christianity stands for and believe in it all then perhaps trying a different denomination  (there are over 40000 of em) may serve you well. However if you are starting to see what christianity does to people and how it enables that behavior,  I would suggest you explore those doubts and research everything you can about science, history, philosophy,  and religions.

"internetparents","t5_31jj6","No, you do NOT always call the police for any traffic accident. If there are serious injuries? Yes. The other driver is obviously impaired? Yes. The drivers are getting into a physical altercation while exchanging insurance information? Yes. Your car cannot be driven but you're in the traffic lane and you're causing a traffic hazard? Yes.    

Unless you live in a small town where there is absolutely nothing else going on, then you do NOT call the police. You pull over out of traffic, exchange insurance information and leave. The police in my city do not even respond to fender benders. If you are in the county, a deputy may respond to facilitate the exchange of insurance information and that is it.     

Furthermore, this accident happened on private property. It's a civil matter. The police will not respond. The only reason to call the police in a private property situation is if it is a hit and run. But if you don't have the license plate or can't personally identify the driver, there's really nothing the police can do.   

In this situation, OP can file a report and may be able to get insurance information from the PD. They have access to DMV info which usually includes insurance information. But if she does not have a license plate or date of birth for the driver, that can be tricky.   

OP needs to file the claim with insurance now. Since she has a name, it's possible they can track down the owner of the other vehicle in their own investigation. Insurance companies do this all the time. They don't want to pay so they will look for the other driver to get his insurance to pay.   

Also, do NOT go to the local PD to speak someone at the desk. They do not have officers manning the desk. They don't have officers hanging out at the police station. Call the non-emergency number for something like this that is after the fact. They will then have an officer call you back as the report can be filed over the phone. If you show up they will just have to dispatch an officer to come there. Waste of time. ",1533081791

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have two stories!:

1. In middle school when I was 11 (middle school started in 6th grade here) I had this awkward girl who had a huge crush on me and said I was her boyfriend. As she was a social outcast, everyone made fun of me for ""dating"" her. I couldn't defend myself at all against her, until one day a pretty 13 year old popular girl told me that she felt bad for me and would pretend to be my girlfriend to not only make the girl jealous, but get everyone off of my back. A week into our ""relationship"" the popular girl found out where I lived and started to hang out with me. I thought it was nice of her at the time and she was a friend, so I was happy for the company. She would come over every day for a couple of days wanting physical affection and constantly texting me ""we should kiss"" while we were in the same room. I constantly told her I wasn't comfortable with that until one Friday she tackled me onto the floor and started licking my entire face like an excited puppy while holding me down. I finally got her off of me and ran away from my house bawling. The next week at school she started making up strange rumors about me and helped turn me into the new social outcast. I did everything I could to avoid her for the rest of that never ending year. I transferred schools after that.

2. (Again) in middle school, I had another social outcast girl develop a huge crush on me. She was aggressive about her flirting, so after my last experience I decided to handle this situation brutally. I made it known to everyone in the room what she was doing and I repeated what she said to embarrass her. It worked too well. She got so pissed that her and three of her friends jumped me in an alley after school and all four of them kicked me until a parent saw and got them off of me. The other girls got away with it, the main one pretty much ended up getting a slap on the wrist :/

I found out not too long after all of this that I liked dudes... I sometimes wonder if I was straight if all of this would have turned out drastically different",1533081793

Its not all to do with being bruisers, some of it is just overall winrate, gimping yourself makes a huge difference at the extremes.  A bad champ played badly, the end result is going to be 0-15.  a good champ played well is going to be 15-0.  Old swain you could literally 100-0 people, and walk out with full health, and in 6 seconds, all your cooldowns would be back up.  It was relatively easy to 1v2, 1v3 at times if you were ahead.  You could do this with voli probably or some other champs now but alot of people just dont care enough to pick up the freelo or just dont want to.

In fact more ‚Äúalt right‚Äù news organisations are popping up because there is demand. Supply doesn‚Äôt magically create demand by itself.

There‚Äôs a rising global trend right now of anti intellectualism, racism, xenophobia, etc. 

It is rooted in many different complex issues - changing demographics, globalisation and outsourcing, declining standard of living for the middle class (or at least stagnant), easily perceived gap between rich and poor, lobbying and corruption in government, social media able to propagate fringe views and manipulate people, rising anger at left wing PC and immigration policies over the last decade or so, poor education funding, etc.

It‚Äôs not just in America where there is Fox News. It‚Äôs all over the place. From the UK to Australia to even Germany.

From a grand holistic point of view - we are in decline. Decline gives rise to populists, decline gives rise to Xenophobia. Fundamentally it‚Äôs being driven by shifting demographics IMO, and it‚Äôs going to get worse before it gets better.",1533081794

Thielen won‚Äôt see 140+ targets again with the arrival of Cousins. He likes to take more shots down the field.

Rashad Penny; nothing to like about his situation. Carson is looming, Prosise taking 3rd downs and that OL is so trash that It‚Äôll be Russ or Bust for the Seahawks most likely anyway.

And finally, Deshaun Watson. Yes I know how good the Texans were with him up and running at full speed, but that type of QB coming off a serious knee injury? Shades of RG3.

this year the Jags have a first-place schedule and other teams will be circling them on the calendar, especially the nationally televised games. those are real factors for a young, inexperienced team. speaking of, young players often struggle with inconsistency. it wouldn't surprise me to see some of their guys follow up last year with worse seasons.

The answer, IMO, is that you do what you can. When you're in college, if you need new nice and well-fitting clothes to a job, you get them how you can. But you continue to ask yourself throughout your life what it really means to ""need"" something, how badly you need it, and how much it's really worth to you -- i.e. not just in the cost you bear, but the associated ethical burdens as well.

*****
&gt; Renowned American scholar and political activist Noam Chomsky has accused Israel of meddling in US elections, stressing that the Israeli intervention &amp;quot;Vastly overwhelms&amp;quot; any efforts allegedly carried out by Russia in 2016.

&gt; &amp;quot;Israeli intervention in US elections vastly overwhelms anything the Russians may have done, I mean, even to the point where the prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu, goes directly to Congress, without even informing the president, and speaks to Congress, with overwhelming applause, to try to undermine the president&amp;#039;s policies - what happened with Obama and Netanyahu in 2015,&amp;quot; he added.

&gt; &amp;quot;Did Putin come to give an address to the joint sessions of Congress trying tocalling on them to reverse US policy, without even informing the president,&amp;quot; Chomsky said.

That regulator shuts off co2 flow into the system when it reaches your max pressure setting, and allows more co2 to flow into the system when it drops below.",1533081799

The story, music, and atmosphere are all great. Playing it now and then finishing Octo Canyon later would probably feel like a downgrade to you, so keep playing the base game for now and then pick up the Expansion when you feel ready for it.

Install the pfSense VM at each location. Then use your providers private network at each location as that location's LAN. The private network's gateway would be that of your pfSense VM. Connect each location to each other via IPsec. You could go for a hub and spoke design, a mesh network or even a hybrid all depending on your needs.

In the next release of pfSense they are adding support for routed IPsec which means you could use OSPF or even BGB to announce the routes of each of your locations. This is much much simpler then the current phase 2 entries each site would have to add.",1533081800

&gt; Renowned American scholar and political activist Noam Chomsky has accused Israel of meddling in US elections, stressing that the Israeli intervention &amp;quot;Vastly overwhelms&amp;quot; any efforts allegedly carried out by Russia in 2016.

&gt; &amp;quot;Israeli intervention in US elections vastly overwhelms anything the Russians may have done, I mean, even to the point where the prime minister of Israel, Netanyahu, goes directly to Congress, without even informing the president, and speaks to Congress, with overwhelming applause, to try to undermine the president&amp;#039;s policies - what happened with Obama and Netanyahu in 2015,&amp;quot; he added.

&gt; &amp;quot;Did Putin come to give an address to the joint sessions of Congress trying tocalling on them to reverse US policy, without even informing the president,&amp;quot; Chomsky said.

Title: **School will not let me see my grades - FERPA violation?**

Original Post: 

&gt; I attended a community college and was on a payment plan. I haven't completed my payments yet so there is a hold on my account. However, I am trying to just view my grades and/or unofficial transcripts which I believe is mandated by law for the school to allow me to do so.  
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; Specifically, article 34 CFR 99.10(d)(1)  which says school must present transcripts when requested (doesn't have to be official). I cannot afford to pay the debt yet but I need to see my previous grades. What should I do?

The 'movement' has these things bound together, this is not without good reason of course. Trans people have been an integral part of the push for the recognition and legalisation of gender and sexual minorities. This is why I used the phrase 'completely different' rather than 'nothing to do with one one another'. *Historically* and *culturally* they're very mixed up together. To refer to the movement using an acronym including both I guess is legitimate. I think me saying it 'made no sense to me' was probably hyperbole. 

However we *must* avoid the confusion that I see an awful lot nowadays where gay people are assumed to also be gender fluid. Or that because someone is gay they have a better understanding of trans people than straight people do. Or that because someone is gay then they must support all sorts of extreme left trans activist nonsense like the non-existence of gender of some such bull-crap. Hell, most trans people I know don't like that shit. Someone being gay doesn't mean they find people being trans any less bizarre. 

Bizarre isn't inherently bad, straight people find people being gay to be bizarre and that's fine, gay people are bizarre in the fact they are gay, being gay is a bizarre thing. But for me the way in which someone being trans is bizarre is fundamentally different and far more extreme than the way someone being gay is bizarre, and to conflate bizarre sexuality with bizarre gender is just bottom line incorrect.

I rarely draw a complete mock before coding -- I'm generally jumping back and forth between drawing, coding and uploading. If you use SVGs and fonts for icons, then you can plug your drawing straight into code via Illustrator, but if you're not an illustrator already then having software that you can't utilize much of isn't going to do you much good. You can get by with great websites without a drop of illustration by using frameworks, free font packs, etc. That said, if you do pick AI up and you go through with it, then [you can draw and code at the same time](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/TightLavishAustraliankelpie-size_restricted.gif) and unlike suggested programs below, you're not limited in what you can draw.

Adobe XD, Sketch, and InDesign would be more practical choices because they're specifically for development, unless you already have an interest in illustration and would start practicing it as a hobby above and beyond dev work. That said, if you're overwhelmed already prior to using your own UI assets then adding yet another mountain of things to learn probably isn't going to help you right now -- you should get your bearings straight in one thing at a time, then lean on prior knowledge while learning new things to practice both at once while having a little familiarity on your side.

Right now, even though the game is new and not available to everyone, the interest is dwindling. Streamers, content creators and players are losing interest and moving onto other games. When asking my viewers why they weren't that interested, even after giving away 20+ keys, the main point of feedback besides simply not enjoying the genre, was that they couldn't play with friends, and couldn't play on the go. Even massive hearthstone streamers and content creators struggle to get 1,000 views on videos to do with MtGA. I get over 1,000 views when I  scratch my ass and I have &lt;half the subs. In comparison while Hearthstone was in closed beta the buzz was enormous.

""accordion anvil"" - the user pulls an anvil out of their pants and drops it on the opponent's head, causing their body to behave like an accordion for one minute

""toon up"" - the user is able to take any item, machine, or vehicle and give it a ""toon up"" (tune up). this grants the same ""toon physics"" to that object, as well as giving it special abilities. for example, a tooned up gun might be able to shoot bullets that chase the opponent; a sword becomes a lightsaber; a ceiling fan becomes a circular saw. effects last one minute

""anthropomorphic allies"" - animals and objects the user touches gain human-like sentience for one minute. they become toons themselves and exaggerated versions of themselves with toon physics. they do what the user tells them to, although they are mischievous and may on occasion ""misunderstand"" orders and inconvenience the user or others. the allies also tend to fight amongst themselves so having more than one ally at a time might not be such a good idea!!

""censorship"" - less of an attack, more of an ability. if the user is able to activate this ability a split second before an attack hits them, a bright flash of light appears and the user receives no damage. if activated too soon or too late, the attack hits [not sure how this ability should be activated]

""Toei time"" - effects both the user and everyone in the nearby vicinity. the user shouts ""Toei time!!"" and for the next minute everyone finds it difficult to move their body correctly. movements become stilted, heads are either too small or too big, women's breasts become twice as large. sometimes a person might find that there's another instance of themselves just standing there. they may experience ""animation errors"" such as a missing limb, or your left arm moving when you meant to move your right. anything that isn't touching you at the moment of Toei time being activated becomes ""background art"" and is unable to be interacted with.",1533081808

*****
&gt; The U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products in early July, and the review period on another $16 billion of imports ends Wednesday.

&gt; The public comment period on the U.S. tariffs aimed at $200 billion ends Aug. 30 after public hearings Aug. 20-23, according to the U.S. Trade Representative&amp;#039;s office.

&gt; The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You‚Äôre completely missing the point of what toxic masculinity is. It is a gender issue, not a biological issue which it appears you are taking it as you are applying it to trans people. The whole idea of gender itself is that we are not the same. So you seemed to have built up this strawman not actually understanding what the belief is.

Toxic masculinity is the idea that the male gender operates under destructive tendencies in order to prove their masculinity (such as not expressing feelings, excessive competition, etc.). Toxic masculinity in no way saying that masculinity is inherently toxic (since masculinity basically describes male gender focused things) but current aspects of what is expected (or not expected) of the male gender is toxic. This leads to many things negative for men such as: increased suicide rate, not getting equal custody rights of children, not believing or taking seriously male rape/assault victims nearly as much, etc. 

There is literally no part of it where it talks about men and women being the same biologically or having the same needs.

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","I've gotten beans in Osaka custom roasted, have Hawaiian beans shipped in monthly and also roast my own from time to time, but usually source it roasted within day of or up to two at WF or the indy shops. Worked as a barista for 2 years. I used to use a scale and measure the water and have an organic chem background. I don't use the scale anymore and usually eyeball and go by sight, feel and aroma. If I use a french press, I'll measure and time it. Agreed that everyone has different tastes, but the smaller amount that is being used lends itself to much higher deviations in flavor when making any tiny changes, deliberate or not. I wasn't recommending to grinding really fine. I was suggesting using more beans for the same cup. Higher ratio. Or just make a slightly larger batch with the same ratio. The grinds look like it didnt have a proper bed depth formed to optimize the time extracting and filtering. It isnt a waste if it gives you a cup you are looking for. If you use less beans the entire time and think it doesnt taste good, would you want to drink cup after cup of poor tasting coffee? As far as the salt, I'm literally talking about a couple crystals of salt. The flavor will be imperceptible, but the action on the tastebuds will make a large difference in exciting the flavors. I dont really use salt too often but when i do its only on the occasion that I find the beans or roast lacking, which I use for mostly stale prepackaged stuff that was given to me as a gift and too polite to say no. Who's to say the beans are necessarily good? Just because it was roasted a certain way from one specific place and made in a formulaic ratio, doesnt a good cup make, especially if they find that the flavor is not to their liking as it highlights different profiles. Just offering that there are different ways to do things that would change it to what the OP is looking for. Another way would be to not fill up the water all the way in the SR method and do multiple shorter pours. It seems like theres too much water flowing through with the large amount of fines present.

&gt; The U.S. imposed 25 percent tariffs on $34 billion of Chinese products in early July, and the review period on another $16 billion of imports ends Wednesday.

&gt; The public comment period on the U.S. tariffs aimed at $200 billion ends Aug. 30 after public hearings Aug. 20-23, according to the U.S. Trade Representative&amp;#039;s office.

&gt; The next wave of U.S. tariffs is set to kick in as soon as Wednesday, with the possible imposition of duties on another $16 billion of Chinese imports.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","""he literally says there are other ways to read the data but he is not even going to consider those. ""

In general, the crux of Harris (and Hughes) argument is that multiple interpretations can be correct.  For example, let's say that blacks earn x% less than whites on average.  Harris and Hughes are saying that to automatically attirbute this to racism is the incorrect approach.  They are also stating that racism can indeed be the factor, the main factor, and even the sole factor.  But one should not dismiss the possibility that other factors might be in play and that racism might not even be the primary factor.   Moreover, Harris and Hughes are stating that one should not be criticized for having a more open-minded approach. 

So I think you are missing the point when you think that there are other ways to interpret the data.  Harris and Hughes are actually the ones embracing the idea that there are many possible ways to interpret the data and they are against the idea of assuming that there is only one way to data.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I think we are reaching the crux of our argument, because there can be no such thing as ""justified discrimination"", as that is the antithesis of what the word entails: 
&gt; dis¬∑crim¬∑i¬∑na¬∑tion,
d…ôÀåskrim…ôÀànƒÅSH(…ô): the **unjust** or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things, especially on the grounds of race, age, or sex. 

Discrimination is not the same as differentiation, as it is inherently negative, and that should give you insight as to why I oppose the term *systemic discrimination* and its relation to *the patriarchy* when it comes to our argument. Like I said, we are arguing semantics, but it is important in this context. 

As for the Catholicism point, no, its treatment of women regarding priesthood cannot change. To change that fact would be to irrevocably change some of the axioms that underlie the entire faith and change the definition of what it means to be Catholic, just as the split of Catholics from the church led to the formation of something new: Protestantism; in other words, in undergoing the change regarding the view on acts of faith, so too did they forfeit Catholicism. This is the definition of a systemic, irrevocable practice, and an appropriate place for the term *systemic discrimination*.

Regarding my point, straight from the pope: 
&gt; The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that only men can receive holy orders because Jesus chose men as his apostles, and the ""apostles did the same when they chose collaborators to succeed them in their ministry."" Blessed John Paul II wrote in 1994 that **this teaching is definitive and not open to debate among Catholics**.

This tradition is literally tied to the foundation of the Church: 

&gt; As the theologian of the papal household, Giertych has the task of reviewing all speeches and texts submitted to Pope Benedict XVI to ensure they are free of doctrinal error. Although his office was not founded until the 13th century, the Dominican claims **St. Paul the Apostle, who corrected St. Peter on important questions of church teaching, as his original forerunner.** (A copy of Rembrandt's portrait of St. Paul in prison hangs on a wall in Giertych's apartment in the Apostolic Palace.)

&gt; ""In theology, we base ourselves not on human expectations, but we base ourselves on the revealed word of God,"" the theologian told Catholic News Service. ""We are not free to invent the priesthood according to our own customs, according to our own expectations.""

That being said, you'd be amazed how dangerous software development can be. there are so many ways things can go wrong due to incompetence or laziness without anyone noticing, and an improperly funded or ill-audited developer can very easily let a vulnarability slip by without noticing. Now, a voting count program isn't terribly complicated if you're just asking for the most barebones tally counter you can imagine, aside from perhaps the scanner input to actually look at the ballot, so I'd too find it extremely unlikely that nobody will notice ""oh, hey, the image reader module has a wrong offset index"" or whatever imaginary backdoor you want to imagine. With proper security measures I'd be perfectly fine with a digital counter.

"yoga","t5_2qhq6","It's hard to describe specifically, but I'll try. Maybe it'll make more sense if I give a little background.

I experienced psychological trauma (what I now see as a spiritual awakening but had no way to process at that time) and then sexual trauma shortly after that. I was around 20.

I repressed the sexual trauma for 10-12 years. Early in that period I fell into alcohol and drug abuse as self-medication. After an arrest, I decided to get help. I cleaned out all the drugs and alcohol and was sober for about five years. Beginning in this period of sobriety, I did tons of spiritual and internal work, developing yoga and meditation practices, following a spiritual path based on indigenous practices (sweat lodges + 'vision quests' (we call them ceremony, but vision quest is the most easily translatable way to describe them). I went through the steps of Alcoholics Anonymous twice, which, if you're unfamiliar are intensely introspection and require thorough self-examination.

But I continued, unknowingly, to repress the sexual trauma.

I knew that something was *off*, but I didn't know what, and I tried my damnedest to fix it by any method but revealing the trauma to myself. Looking back, I was in denial. The truth arose continually in my mind, but I pushed it out of my consciousness. I refused to accept it. I refused to incorporate it into my psyche. I refused to accept that it had happened or entertain the possibility.

So while I had all this new spiritual and personal knowledge, I was still deeply unwell. I knew all the right words to say, but none of them were true in my core. I didn't live any of them. I thought I did, but the truth was that my entire personality was constructed around protecting myself from investigating my trauma. All kinds of verbal defense mechanisms when dealing with other people. *Intellectual* defense mechanisms when dealing with myself. I *thought* my way around dealing with the trauma.

Fast forward to August 20, 2017, the day before the solar eclipse. I read my horoscope for what the eclipse would mean for me. It said I would have a revelation about my sexuality. The eclipse happened. I was hoping the revelation would be that this woman I worked with was soon going to fall in love with me. Instead, the next day, Tuesday, August 22, I was at a meditation group, and the topic of sexual abuse came up. The leader of the group intimated that it was clear that I had experienced sexual trauma. This confluence of what felt to be divinely inspired events finally popped the truth of trauma loose. That night I accepted the truth that I'd been raped for the first time.

As you can imagine, after 10-12 years of repression (I don't remember when exactly. Those years were fuzzy for me and I was black out during the act.), this was rather disorienting.

This revelation unleashed a torrent of personal revelation and an unimaginably uncomfortable re-acclimation process.

I don't have a great metaphor for it yet, but it was as if all of that spiritual work I did was waiting to integrate itself into my being but it needed the trauma to be released for it to take effect. It was like I was a snake and I shed my skin every day or sometimes every couple hours. At first the revelations were blunt and painful, but slowly, as I came to terms with things, they became more refined and deeper.

At first it was obvious outward behavior. Then it was motivations for saying things, for example. Like, why the fuck am I so sarcastic all the time? Now it's really deep stuff like, oh shit, I've been subconsciously pursuing an archetypal way of being that will garner me the love, respect, and awe of everyone I meet. I do this because I crave love but I'm terrified of it, so I construct my identity as if I've figured out a loophole in which I won't have to risk rejection or failure in love but will gain the love of *everyone* through awe-inspiring wisdom, undeniable achievement, and great good humor, when what I really want is real, normal, one-to-one love with other human beings, which is impossible unless I get honest with myself and others about what I want and why I'm here.

I also had to come to terms with and forgive myself for some of the awful shit that *I've* done. This was one of the most important parts and allowed me to release so nasty energy that I'd been hanging onto and was rerouting my kundalini in an unhealthy way.

I just got to the heart of those last two truths last night, just over 11 months later, and I finally feel like a whole person again for the first time in over a decade. Tomorrow is my last day at my corporate job. I now begin my new life as a neuroscience/ psychology student, yoga teacher, and meditation instructor.

Imagine that you were a perfect angel who decided to  experiment with drugs and sex out of the blue as a young teenager. Imagine that your parents discovered that their perfect little girl was not only growing up too fast, but experimenting in ways that they weren't sure you were ready to handle. Imagine the panic your mother feels every time she sees you seeming to act out and how she struggles to restrain herself. 

Does she express herself perfectly? No, but I don't know any perfect teens or parents, and you really don't either. All perfect relationships unravel if you put them under a microscope. The fact is that you describe a mostly functional relationship where you guys can find moments of fun, but when you get emotional you push her buttons in ways you may not even recognize and she responds in ways she may regret later. 

I suggest writing a letter to your mother asking if you guys could meet together and separately with a family counselor to help you find better ways to communicate when upset. You need to break the cycle now.

I saw this in my own family, and the results have been encouraging. Nothing is perfect, but you guys can work this out",1533081819

&gt; RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil&amp;#039;s three largest fuel distribution companies are under investigation for fixing prices at the pump, police said on Tuesday, reigniting debate over potential collusion among gas station owners in Latin America&amp;#039;s largest oil producer.

&gt; They accused the fuel distribution companies of dictating the prices at the pump charged by individual gas station owners, a violation of Brazilian market rules that the owners should have freedom to set prices freely.

&gt; The three companies under investigation together control more than two-thirds of the national fuel distribution market, according to data from oil regulator ANP. The operation is the latest effort by Brazilian authorities to clamp down on collusion and price fixing in the fuel distribution market, which has been the most common target of accusations for cartel behavior by antitrust watchdog Cade.

Jawless fishes like the lamprey are the first animals that developed an adaptive immune system because they are able to form an immunological memory against pathogens, whereas all invertebrates before them could not, and relied on a primitive innate immunity. Their robust adaptive immune system may explain in part why they are successful, but won't explain why they can be an invasive species. There are still several differences from higher vertebrates in terms of immunology, but I think they're really cool in that they firmly cement adaptive immunity as a vertebrate specific adaptation, among other things they appear to be the first to have, like thyroid glands for their larval metamorphosis that function more or less the same way in jawed fish and amphibians.",1533081822

"deadbydaylight","t5_3cb2g","&gt;and how awful the devs are and they're killing the game omg.

I feel like this comes out of the notion that the devs saying they care about the community which, to individuals, gets interpreted as ""They care about me and how I have fun"". But here's the rub. Take Rocket League, for instance. A game mixing car racing and soccer, y'know, it SHOULD be fun. It should be what you get!

But when the devs change stuff and mess with balance, what you expect to get or what you've been happy with changes into something else. I think people just don't want to feel cheated because the game they liked, changed. And you can argue that's a part of any online game, but it becomes frustrating when you pay money for an experience you expect to last forever and it doesn't because what the devs are making the game into is different from what the game was in one way or another.

I really enjoyed Awesomenauts for a while, to the point that I paid $75 to their Starstorm Kickstarter back in 2013 and accrued 700-some hours in it. But I stopped wanting to play as much when A. Every character I found fun had their abilities changed because they either went used or stuff was being used by other people to do meta builds and B. More importantly, they had their own forums (including balance forums), but told the community NOTHING about what they wanted for their characters.

What is the point of a balance forum at that rate? You want feedback? For what??? They had a Beta subforum too so it's not like ""Oh they just want feedback on Beta balance changes"". And you might say ""Well it's just so people throw ideas out there"" but pissing in the wind doesn't seem like as much help when they would make changes regardless of what we wanted, based on their own vision. And they never shared that vision for us.

What characters were supposed to have what roles (Since Awesomenauts was a 2D moba)? What constitutes ""harassers""? ""Assassins""? And I don't mean in the context of mobas I mean for this game. What should each role, each archetype, be capable of? What about individual characters? They never told us what they wanted for individual characters and seemed to prefer people just randomly throwing out ideas they wouldn't take most of anyway.

To connect this to the general point though, just... A game can change in ways you don't really like because it's not what you signed up for. All the characters I liked in Awesomenauts were changed. And I'm not saying the game should be made to accommodate me. But y'know, I paid over $100 total from the Kickstarter combined with skins and other stuff. So it's a bit of sunk cost. But it's also the fact that I paid that much money with the expectation that I'd always have a game I could come back to almost, and I don't necessarily have that. 

And again that's how I think some people feel. Obviously you shouldn't expect a game being updated to stay the exact same but if you get into it for one reason or like it for one part and that gets threatened, you might feel territorial and not want to lose it. Because you paid for the game as much as anyone else.",1533081825

"lost","t5_2qhag","I think the creatives were trying hard to do something unique and interesting with the FSW.  As Lindelof said [in a talk in 2012 at an Austin film festival](https://video.klru.tv/video/on-story-conversation-damon-lindelof/):

&gt;""We didn't call it 'The Sideways' in the writer's room... We referred to it as 'The Bardo,' ... [from the] *Tibetan Book of the Dead*... essentially a concept where when you die, you don't know that you're dead... And your journey is about coming to the revelation that you have died, then you are ready to move on."" 

&gt;In spiritual terms - and *Lost* never shied away from the spiritual element - Bardo is about liberation from the temptations of the temporal world and attaining enlightenment, a sort of Buddhist purgatory where the soul finds release from the worldly notions that have held it down.  ([link](https://books.google.com/books?id=ZCOtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=entertaining+judgment+lost+bardo&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NWmCBrjqRJ&amp;sig=dJFVtlVUJe31oG6v4kQihnsz7iM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja-PSA8IfcAhUOXa0KHayHBdcQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=entertaining%20judgment%20lost%20bardo&amp;f=false))

Further, the bardo contains all sorts of entities - friendly and scary - who represent the individual's karmic burdens.  Thus people whose lives have been full of violence will run into terrifying, violent situations (like Jin and Sayid with Keamy &amp; his thugs.)

I think it was an ambitious attempt, and the ""old hippies"" in the audience (who probably had both the Tibetan and Egyptian books of the dead on their shelves in college) caught the references, and how the seemingly weird side characters &amp; scenes were used.  But I think a lot of it went over viewers' heads, and ended up frustrating them.

[Edited to add: This is NOT to say that these viewers were ""stupid.""  Sometimes if regular viewers don't ""get"" something, it \*can\* be because the presentation is muddled.]

As you can see, transubstantiation really doesn't take away the mystery aspect, it just states that what was bread before is now substantially the Body of Christ and the what was wine is now substantially His Blood. It doesn't talk about the mechanics, which would remove the mystery.

By far one of the best desserts I've made. Below is the original recipe. Some alterations I made are : 

I used flax milk in place of almond milk (that's what I had on hand).

I used Lakato golden sweetener and made it into a powder with a spice grinder.

I used Lily's chocolate for the ganache and omitted the stevia drops.

If your custard gets thick after being refrigerated, add HWC to thin it out.

I used parchment paper and greased my cake pans with coconut oil.

I shaved and chopped 1 oz of Lily's dark chocolate and sprinkled it on top.

* Cake:

* 1 cup almond flour

* 1 scoop protein powder unflavored (about 2 Tbsp)

* ‚Öî cup powdered erythritol

* 1 ¬Ω tsp baking powder 

* ¬Ω cup almond milk

* 2 eggs (separated)

* ¬º cup olive oil

* 1 tsp vanilla

* ¬º tsp cream of tartar


* Custard:

* 4 egg yolks

* ¬Ω cup heavy cream

* 1 tsp vanilla extract

* ‚Öì cup powdered erythritol

* 2 Tbsp butter

* ‚Öõ tsp xantham gum


* Ganache:

* 2 oz unsweetened dark baking chocolate

* 1 Tbsp butter

* ¬Ω cup heavy cream

* 35 drops liquid stevia (or to taste)


Instructions


1. Cake:

2. Preheat oven to 350¬∞F.

3. Separate eggs with egg whites in one bowl and egg yolks in another bowl.

4. In a medium mixing bowl combine almond flour, protein powder, powdered erythritol, and baking powder.

5. Add egg yolks, almond milk, oil, and vanilla to dry ingredients.

6. Beat with an electric mixer on low to medium speed until combined.

7. Then, beat an additional 3 minutes on high speed and set aside.

8. In a large mixing bowl, beat egg whites and cream of tartar on medium to high speed until soft peaks form.

9. Add egg whites to egg yolks batter and fold in.

10. Gently pour the batter into 2 8 inch greased cake pans.

11. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown and toothpick comes out clean in the center.

12. Cool completely before removing from pans.


13. Custard:

14. In a medium saucepan over low heat, add heavy cream and butter until the cream has bubbles around the top edge of the heavy cream. Do not boil.

15. Add sweetener and xantham gum.

16. Add egg yolks to a bowl.

17. Temper the egg yolks by adding some of the hot cream mixture to the egg yolk bowl, mix in.

18. This will bring the egg yolks up to the temperature of the cream mixture so it won‚Äôt scramble when you add it to the hot heavy cream mixture.

19. Add the egg yolks to the heavy cream mixture, whisking consistently.

20. When the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla.

21. The custard should coat the back of a spoon.

22. Transfer the custard to a bowl and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.

23. This can be made ahead of time and just store in the fridge up to 24 hours.


24. Ganache:

25. Break up unsweetened chocolate and butter.

26. Place in a bowl and set aside.

27. Place the heavy cream in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Do not cover.
28. Whisk the cream every so often to keep from breaking.

29. Watch the cream closely and remove from the burner as soon as it gets bubbles around the top edge just before the boiling point. Do not boil.

30. Pour over chocolate and butter.

31. Whisk until fully combined. It will take a couple minutes of whisking to incorporate... be patient it will come together.

32. Add stevia and whisk it into the smooth chocolate mixture.

33. You can now pour it over the cake so that it covers the whole top and drips down the sides.


34. To assemble the cake:

35. Remove cooled cakes from the pans.

36. Place one of the cakes on a serving plate or cake stand.

37. Put on the custard onto the bottom cake layer and spread evenly across.

38. Be sure not to get too close to the edge because it will spill out when you put the top layer on.

39. Top with the second layer of cake.

40. Pour chocolate ganache over and down the sides of the cake.

41. Store in the refrigerator

On the team side, with an improved receiving corps there's concern than some of the points may shift from backfield to out wide. That said, his ability to increase his volume can offset these factors even if they come down some.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","&gt; That's not illegal though. 

Never claimed it to be, although conspiring with a foreign agent to commit crimes against the US or a US citizen would be a crime. I claimed it to be a piece of evidence which places the theory that Trump colluded with Russia well inside the realm of possibility and also separates it from your theory (which, again, has no proof other than that some of the people - just because, apparently - who were wrong once, some possibly mislead, happen to agree once more). 

&gt; The one with Putin and trump conspiring requires them to act biologically and against their own interests at so many points

This is just a wrong. National interests maybe, but nobody believes Trump is colluding in hopes of making America a better place.

&gt; and the evidence promoted to back it is so silly

Yeah, total stretch to think that the guy who took a meeting with Russians in an effort to get dirt on his opponent would ever work with that country to manipulate an election. Not suspect at all that he is reluctant (straight up defiant actually) as hell to sanction the country responsible for attempting to manipulate our elections. Also not suspicious that it's the same country he just happened to meet with before the election. And the fact that he won't let the investigation into his totally-not-suspicious activity proceed without trying to disrupt it and sway public opinion against it (often by attempting to misguide the public about the facts of the investigation) is totally fine and in no way suspicious. Why are we even looking into this?

&gt; Obviously, where mueller, cia, NYT, etc are involved, having the backing of our security agencies and foreign allies doesn't mean something is true.

Lol at you throwing the NYT in there but even without it, this is just silly. Regardless of if you believe Trump committed crimes against the US, at the very least, the investigation is completely warrented. Also, Mueller didn't start this investigation and has asserted next to nothing regarding Trump thus far so you're listing someone who is simply gathering evidence at this point.

And why exactly do you believe all of these people and agencies would make this up? Where is the motive?",1533081827

Briana isn't certain how she'd want her engagement or proposal to go.  As a girl, she had fantastical ideas of romantic horse rides along the northern cliffs and the idea that her dashingly handsome partner would somehow sweep her off her feet.  But those were just silly childhood fantasies.  She really just didn't... think about them anymore.

Alistair knew he wanted the opposite of what actually happened.  He'd saved up every coin he could, pocketing it in favour of buying his share of supplies and rations to try and slowly save up enough money in order to buy Briana... something.  He didn't know what, but he wanted to get her *something.*  When he saw the dwarven made ring, he thought it would be a nice gift, but then he started to think about it *more* and thought that maybe... maybe he could *ask* and maybe she'd say *yes!*  Of course, Alistair had know idea how to actually broach the subject, and tried practicing all sorts of lines but he never really got much further than knowing it would be expected of him to get down on one knee and maybe he'd just *know* when the time was right.

But if the Landsmeet botched any idea of a romantic or proper proposal, they both got a wedding neither one of them could have ever dreamed up.  Yes it was a grand affair with every bann and arl from all over the country having to be invited, and a lot of insincere well wishers which Alistair could have done without, but there was all sorts of food, as much ale as he could hope for, all their friends were in attendance, and it was maybe the first thing about being king that he didn't think was all that bad.  And Briana, of course, was finally back in her element.  It was the first time since the Blight that she was dressed up.  No more armour and plate, no more dirty and torn woolen tunics.  She was in a *dress* made of silk, with ribbons and flowers in her hair and Alistair was forever glad that no one was looking at him when she first entered the Chantry because he swears his heart must have stopped beating the moment he saw her.",1533081829

"shogi","t5_2rkeb","Oui is playing Sente for this game.

1. P-5f - Sente pushed the central Pawn. This shows his intention to choose ranging Rook opening.
2. P-8d - The challenger pushed his Rook Pawn to show his intention to choose static Rook. The opening is most likely to be ranging Rook vs static Rook.
3. P-7f - Sente opened the diagonal of his Bishop with this Pawn advancement. Before this move, Sente's Bishop has no where to go. After this move, it has five squares to move and it attacks the 3c Pawn on the opponent's camp.
4. S-6b - Gote moved up his right Silver to 6b.
5. P-5e - Sente advanced a vanguard Pawn on the central file. It looks like Sente is choosing central Rook.
6. K-4b - Gote let his King move to 4b. It accords with [the shogi proverb](https://www.reddit.com/r/shogi/comments/822oda/diagram_updates_shogi_proverbs_with_commentaries/) that Don't put the King and Rook close together.
7. R-5h - Sente moved his Rook to the central file to support the vanguard Pawn on the central file.
8. P-8e - Gote pushed his Rook Pawn twice to try to trade the Rook Pawn on 8f.
9. B-7g - Sente declined the Pawn trade with this Bishop move to protect the 8f square.
10. P-7d - Gote pushed the 7th file Pawn to clear the 7c square to let his right Silver and/or Knight become able to go there.
11. S-6h - Sente developed his left Silver once to 6h to add a guardian to protect the vanguard Pawn on 5e. This silver will probably go to the f-row to protect it.
12. S-7c - Gote developed his right Silver twice to 7c.
13. S-5g - Sente developed his left Silver twice to 5g.
14. S-6d - Gote developed his right Silver third time to 6d. It is aiming for Pawn exchange on 7e square using this Silver and S-6e advancement to snatch the isolated 7f Pawn.
15. S-6f - Sente developed his left Silver third time to 6f to prevent Sente from trading Pawns on 7e and advancing his Silver to 6e.
16. G6a-5b - Gote moved up his left Gold to 5b to start building a castle. It accords to an opening principle that [Defend the King with three generals](https://www.reddit.com/r/shogi/comments/822oda/diagram_updates_shogi_proverbs_with_commentaries/dvik72z/).
17. K-4h - Sente also start building a castle for his King. Moving his King once is the first step of it.
18. **S-3b** \- Gote moved up his left Silver to 3b to forming a left Mino castle. The timing of this Silver move is rather new. When Gote built left Mino castle, he used to move this Silver after moving his King to 2b or 2c. It means Gote used to need extra three moves of K-3b, B-3c or P-2d, and K-2b or K-2c before moving up the Silver to 3b. In this new way, Gote has an option to go into the middle-game with keeping his King staying on 3a. The idea behind this early S-3b is to form a castle quicker than former ways.
19. K-3h - Sente's King moved twice to 3h. The King should be apart from the Rook in general.
20. K-3a - Gote's King moved twice to 3a.
21. K-2h - Sente's King moved three times to 2h.
22. P-1d - Gote pushed the edge Pawn on the 1st file, asking whether Sente choose, Anaguma or Mino castle. If Sente responds to it with P-1f, Sente is most likely to choose Mino castle. If not, Sente will probably choose Anaguma castle.
23. P-1f - Sente pushed the edge Pawn to 1f to open a possible escaping path for the King in the endgame.
24. P-4d - Gote pushed the 4th file Pawn without opening the diagonal of Bishop. Now Gote's Bishop is less active since its diagonal is blocked twice with his Pawns on 3c and 4d.
25. **P-5d** \- Sente offered trading the central Pawns with this move without building Mino Castle with S-3h.
26. Px5d - Gote took the Pawn to accept the Pawn trade.
27. Rx5d - Sente took back the Pawn with the Rook. It's practically forced.
28. G-4c - Gote moved up his right Gold to 4c threatening to take the 5d Rook and protecting the isolated 4d Pawn. **If Gote's 4th file Pawn stayed on the original position, P\*5e to trap the Rook like Sx5e S-6e would exist.**
29. R-5i - Sente pulled back his Rook to the bottom row getting away from the capture threat.
30. P-3d - Gote finally opened the diagonal of his Bishop to protect the 4d Pawn twice.
31. **S-5e** \- Sente offered Silver trade with this move. In this game, **Sente is prioritizing major piece activity sacrificing tempo**.
32. Sx5e - 38 minutes were spent for this move. Gote accepted the Silver trade.
33. Bx5e - Sente took back the Silver threatening to take the Rook on 8b and skewering the Lance on 9a.
34. S\*6d - Gote dropped a interfering Silver on 6d threatening to take the 5e Bishop.
35. B-7g - Sente pulled back the Bishop to 7g to prevent Sente from trading Rook Pawn on 8f again. **Now, Sente lost a lot of tempo while his major pieces are more active than Gote's and he has a Silver in hand. Gote must use the dropped Silver effectively later in this game.**
36. **P\*5d** \- Gote dropped a Pawn on 5d interfering Sente's Rook to get it less active. **Gote's plan seems to try to restrict the activities of Sente's major pieces using the 6d Silver.**
37. **L-1h!** \- Sente moved up his right Lance to 1h to aim for building Anaguma castle. It's a little surprise that it would be inconsistent with advancing the right edge Pawn to 1f with 23.P-1f. Moreover, it will take three more moves to secure the safety of Sente's King like K-1i, S-2h and G-3i which Gote might exploit.
38. B-3c - 45 minutes were spent for this move. Gote moved up his Bishop to 3c to clear the 2b square.
39. K-1i - Sente's King moved behind the 1h Lance to build Anaguma.
40. K-2b - Gote's King moved to the cleared 2b square.
41. S- 2h - Sente moved his right Silver to 2h to continue building Anaguma.
42. P-8f - Gote tried to sacrifice his Rook Pawn. If Sente responds to it with Px8f and his Bishop is gone, Gote's Rook can be more active to take the Pawn on 8f thanks to this sacrifice in the future. Please refer to the shogi proverb that ""[Begin your attack with a sacrifice of Pawn push](https://www.reddit.com/r/shogi/comments/822oda/diagram_updates_shogi_proverbs_with_commentaries/dvs0fkf/)"".
43. Px8f - Sente cannot allow Gote to break through the 2nd file and took the sacrificed Pawn. It's practically forced. If he took it with the Bishop, P-4e threatening to take the 9i Lance would be annoying.
44. P-7e - Gote tried to offer Pawn exchange using the 6d Silver.
45. Px7e - Sente accepted the Pawn trade on the 7e square.
46. Sx7e - Gote captured back the Pawn with the Silver advancement.
47. G-7h - Sente moved his left Gold to 7h to protect 6g, 7g, and 8g squares.
48. **P-6d** \- **82 minutes were spent for this move.** Gote pushed the 6th file Pawn to 6d. It's a quiet move which is hard to see. The idea behind this Pawn advancement may be to advance a vanguard Pawn to 6e to prevent Sente's Bishop from developing to 6f and then to capture the 8f Pawn with Sx8f threatening to take the Bishop on 7g.
49. R-5f - **78 minutes were spent for this move**. Sente moved up his Rook to the f-row to protect the 8f Pawn twice. Toyoshima made the next move sealed. Day 1 is over.",1533081829

"Blackops4","t5_2untl",""" one cannot argue that boots on the ground call of duties have proven to create the largest skill gap due to its strategic nature ""

This is a poorly structured statement in my opinion since you yourself have admitted in various replies that this point is at the very least open for discussion. I would absolutely argue that advanced movement creates a larger skill-gap (in general) compared to BOTG since I feel it requires a much greater balance of skills and I see a ton of evidence of this in the spread between the great and the newer players in lobbies. In BO3 and IW, I would often see 1-3 players absolutely dominating with an exceptional kill spread while many of the players on the bottom end of the lobby struggled to even get a kill for every several deaths. This is something I personally don't see as often or at least not nearly to the same extent in a game like WWII. The better players will still rise to the top but they don't seem to stand out nearly as much from the rest compared to advanced movement games.

With BOTG, positioning is by far the most important skill to have and without it, often times no amount of gunskill will get you out of a bad situation. With advanced movement, positioning is still very important to find any sort of consistent success but you need to be able to back it up with gunskill to truly excel. The way I see it is if you take a new player that has no experience with a CoD game and you put him against an above average player in both styles of game, the newbie will stand a much better chance of killing the above average player in a BOTG game. 

I'll also add that I feel advanced movement provides far more tactical options to use and also to be used against you which requires a more versatile skillset to execute and defend against.",1533081829

#1 Make sure you have fast draining soil. Plumerias hate wet feet and it will cause them to get root rot and die. Not sure? Get a $10 moisture meter from a box store. They like being on the dry side so don't over water. 
#2 How often do you fertilize? You can get a long term organic fertilizer that you  apply once a season. Water soluable are good too, you just need to apply more frequently. Just make sure you stick with a NPK that's fairly even and with a P no higher than 45.

First I'd like to say I was hoping for some epic and emotional music. Why wouldn't they use Lament of the highborne or some such music while showing Arthas killing her. Also didn't she serve for some time at Arthas' side as a banshee until she managed to break free and pop into her old corpse. I feel like they just showed nothing of her actual suffering by Arthas' hand.  
They should've shown her suffering in more detail to actually make us care.  
  
Second why do we have to get another Garrosh v2 in Sylvanas? They already fucked up Thralls story. They killed off my favorite leader in Vol'Jin. And I really can't see a redemption story for Sylvanas, it would just be bad at this point.  
  
Personally I've played Horde faction for 10 years and I've always felt there was shades of grey on both sides, but there's been a few expansions now where I feel like Horde's side of things have turned to complete warmongering with no other good reason than fuck everything.  
  
I've always looked at both Vol'Jin and Sylvanas as schemers. Being coy about their real objectives. While we don't know yet if Sylvanas will get proper writing, I feel like she's been out of character for some time. Sylvanas never fit the warchief role. We should not know what she has planned until the very second she unleashes her fury. Sylvanas being a mysterious leader is what drives us to like her. For their own good they should just make Sylvanas come up with some excuse as to why she cannot lead the horde and give the mantle to a bonfire or something.",1533081830

    But, obviously, this is my own opinion of what I wrote., and as I am not ever  the final arbiter of anything I create, as to its worth or viability. It was also my first contribution to Reddit, so a conscious decision to do what represents me was made -  if that helps. 
   Pared down I could have said after 45 years of being involved in the drug world and rock bands, I've come to see that this discussion leads to virtually nowhere. We are in more trouble from lacking commonality of  language and understanding word definitions, both properly used and the meaning of ; when said under false definition.  So in my opinion , until we make effort toward that problem , these types of opinions, facts ( cold and sterile) staid or vitriolically stated will probably get us nowhere , My strong belief in that "" truth"" drove my decision  to make it human, heartfelt and sad, tragic and funny, full of hope and hopeless in a novel where those non-members of the choir, might find a cathartic light at the end of that tunnel vision world they move through and see someone they know personally in a character of my novel . Believe me, I know, have known, did know and miss every one of the ostensively fictional characters ive introduced to the readers, should there ever be any. 
    I get it though and do not dispute your opinion. I should have stuck to the more direct, opinion driven, for or against posting along with the rest with or without those cold sterile facts or graphs.. 
   I thought about that, but I'm sure I would not have added anything that wasn't already covered, so I did what was me and hoped it might stand apart (in any manner. ) So to say I said a lot without saying anything in my post was exactly what my first words were saying, just as they've been doing for over 35 years now.

&gt; President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Tuesday that the ANC would support an amendment to a section of South Africa&amp;#039;s Constitution to &amp;quot;Explicitly&amp;quot; expropriate land without compensation.

&gt; The ANC resolved to expropriate land without compensation at its watershed national elective conference in December, which it followed up in February when it supported an EFF motion to expropriate without compensation in the National Assembly.

&gt; The party&amp;#039;s land summit had also decided that land expropriation without compensation could also go ahead, adding that certain national departments such as public works, basic education and human settlements already had the power to expropriate land without compensation.

probability of picking the car: A = 1/3, B = 1/3, C = 1/3

collectively the probability NOT picking the car is 2/3 (B + C = 1/3 + 1/3 = 2/3)

The host opens door C to reveal a goat.

You now know that C has a 0% chance of being the car, however the chance of you picking correctly initially is still 1/3 correct and 2/3 wrong, therefore B + C must still equal 2/3.

Because of that the probability distribution for each door now looks like this: A = 1/3, B = 2/3, C = 0

so now you either stay with your 1/3, or swap to the collective 2/3 that is now all placed upon a single door. You can look up the outcomes of every possible scenario, and swapping in each one will overall give you a win 2/3rds of the time.

In those notes under the section discussion who are *actual* members of the Church (important as only *actual* members of the Church are saved as per *extra Ecclesiam nulla salus*) from *Mystici Corporis* 22:

&gt; Actually only those are to be included as members of the Church who have been baptized and profess the true faith, and who have not been so unfortunate as to separate themselves from the unity of the Body, or been excluded by legitimate authority for grave faults committed.

Hence, those who are not members are those:

* Who are not baptized
* Who are public formal heretics
* Who are public formal schematics
* Who are under the sentence of excommunication *vitandi*

What you are describing is excommunication *tolerati*. Those excommunicated *tolerati* are still members of the Church.

So you can see that the Church *can* damn someone via excommunication *vitandi* for the original reasons I gave which you claimed to be ""completely incorrect"". ",1533081832

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I think there‚Äôs two forms of online dating. One I think is okay, the other one I don‚Äôt think is healthy. 

Type 1: Using online dating sites/apps to find someone to meet and date in person. This is the type I‚Äôm for, clearly, as I met my now boyfriend via a dating site. We talked for a short time (a couple weeks, which is longer than I like, but there were extenuating personal and fully explained circumstances that extended talk before meet time). 

Type 2: talking to someone strictly online and deciding to be in a relationship without ever having met in person. I don‚Äôt think this is very healthy. You can never truly know someone without seeing them in person. Seeing their quirks, how they interact with people, meeting their friends, all says so much about a person. It‚Äôs so easy to hide who you are or for them to hide who they are. Even if they are their picture, it‚Äôs impossible to be sure about their personality. I mean, there are never any guarantees, but seeing a person in their environment says a lot about most people. ",1533081832

"Metroid","t5_2rrd6","I tough the same as you about Mark Brown since when I saw the Boss Keys video from Zelda I. Like the SR x M2 x AM2R video, if I recall correctly, he bashed those who thought the game has an absurdous amount of criptic moments and who didn't like the ""bomb every random wall or fire every bush"" aspect of the game. It's not entiiiirely true but the game has a fair amount of this and this isn't fun.

Then the SR analysis came, and I basically have the same points of view that you have, especially the absurd amount of romanticism to the original game (it even became a joke between me and a friend).

And here we are. In this video he didn't really put any form of praise to the level design from the original Metroid, but the way he bashed the level design kind of scared me. he almost didn't talk ANYTHING about the positive aspects of the game, about the replay value, the new bosses, new rooms and puzzles, soundtrack, the possibilities of sequence breaking. Half of the video (or basically the entire section dedicated to ZM) was he being critical about the Chozo Statues. I'm interested in see how he will deal with the sequence breaking in Super Metroid, if it will have the same line of thinking from this video (""in the first time the player will never do it"").

I always though that he has an preference to open-world/non-linear games, and there's nothing wrong with that. But I think he should be a little more impartial in these aspects as he has a chanel with a large number of views, and a... ""respected"" game reviewer.",1533081832

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","&gt; I don't see how him calling out people that steal applies to you, I understand where you're coming from, but understand what I say at face value, unless you steal, you are not a thief; unless you did not pay for the software you are playing, then you are not a pirate. Dumping your carts is not piracy, even if Nintendo ""views it as piracy"". Installing open source ports is not piracy. Using homebrew is not piracy. Cheating in singleplayer games, and even multi, is not piracy. Reviving portions of DS games through illegal software is not piracy. The person you replied to was speaking entirely of pirates (at face level).

he clearly equates ""making the most out of the system"" to piracy.

&gt; Ok, that's legitimately piracy, and my argument isn't that there aren't legitimate reasons to do such, so when you engage these people you should occlude that and argue from a purely ""ideal user"" standpoint. The argument that some games that are otherwise unattainable should be morally legal to pirate is a perfectly legitimate argument to me, but you have to do separate battles. That's how you win people over. That's how you win arguments.

morally? its not a matter of ""what is piratable and what is not"", either everything is piratable or nothing is, i have over 200 steam games in my account, but i wouldnt even glanced at half of them if i hadnt gotten the chance of playing them through piracy (which isnt ilegal in my country, its a grey area), is that wrong? is getting something that would be otherwise inaccessible to me due to ridiculously high prices before be wrong?

just remember that even mr rogers himself said that (and im paraphrasing here) ""if someone cant watch my show at a certain time, its fine for them to tape it to watch it later"".

&gt; He was calling out people who don't pay for games in general, when you defend this outright, you look bad.

once again, what if my only way of accesing them is paying multiple times the US prices of those games?

&gt; When Nintendo does an update like this the last thing you want to do is further ostracize the homebrew community, we should be instead pointing to all the legitimate users Ninty just rolled over with this latest update.

as if that matters, nintendo will never care, people should care and ostracize nintendo for it, when people use the ability to pirate to justify ostracizing people that just want to get more out of their consoles they are a lost case, a corporate shill is unlikely to change his opinion when he had corporate talking points shoved down their throats since they were kids.

&gt;  Now is not the time to argue for legitimate forms of piracy, that's a different battle. That's just what I'm saying.

the time? the time for what? its not like nintendo will do anything if we complain, even if its most of the community.",1533081832

Someone else eating 3 times the amount of food she does is going to cost her 3x her normal budget. Thats a lot. I can do the same thing OP does. I don't eat very much so when I do eat, its something I like. I know it isn't healthy at all but somedays I'm working long shifts all I eat is some fruit and cottage cheese + a mocha frappe from McDonalds. My husband eats three times what I eat too, maybe more some days. I don't have the issue OP is having because my husband is an amazing cook and we both love finding various ways to get quality food and ingredients. We have  a huge garden, berry bushes, a small apple/pear orchard, and chickens of our own. (just eggs. our chickens retire when they're older, I don't kill them. We let them do chicken things until they die of old age). OP might want to try that. She may not live anywhere that a garden or trees &amp; bushes are possible but even growing an herb garden on a window sill saves money. 

If I didn't have access to berries we grew ourselves I would rarely eat any besides strawberries. They're way too expensive from the store. We have found great places to buy spices and sauces online, tried all kinds of exotic foods, and hunted around to find bent-and-dents and other things like that. I don't know if OP and her bf have the time to do that, but it may be something they could do once a month or so.

&gt; President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Tuesday that the ANC would support an amendment to a section of South Africa&amp;#039;s Constitution to &amp;quot;Explicitly&amp;quot; expropriate land without compensation.

&gt; The ANC resolved to expropriate land without compensation at its watershed national elective conference in December, which it followed up in February when it supported an EFF motion to expropriate without compensation in the National Assembly.

&gt; The party&amp;#039;s land summit had also decided that land expropriation without compensation could also go ahead, adding that certain national departments such as public works, basic education and human settlements already had the power to expropriate land without compensation.

The main criticisms I have for Yuuki Yuna are that the pacing is kind of weird (it starts off *very* slow) and I remember feeling that some of the characters' choices in the latter part of the show didn't make sense to me and felt forced. I wish I could be more specific but I watched it a few years ago.

I just felt like the whole *SURPRISE being a magical girl is suffering* thing was handled better in Madoka Magica and came to a more satisfying conclusion, though now I'm finding out that Yuuki Yuna wasn't as self-contained as I had thought, so maybe I'd feel differently if I read/watched some of the other stuff in the franchise.

I still think it's worth watching, since I know some people do prefer it over Madoka Magica, and it's not like I thought it was bad on its own.",1533081834

* Crew qualifications (Basic, Expert, Ace) for specific ships in each slot will also be wiped, and Silver Lions and Golden Eagles spent refunded.

Many of the people who say tons of really negative things about their experience in the city probably spend a lot of time in and around the bad parts of town (the Tenderloin, Market from like 2nd or 3rd to at least Van Ness, etc.). Unfortunately, those bad parts of town are very central, rather large, and growing, so more and more people's view of the city becomes understandably dominated by frequent bad experiences with the homeless population.

Good throughput too - 20 SPM (science per minute), if I'm not mistaken? Although as far as I can tell, your intermediates production is overbuilt relative to the science pack assemblers, see [here](https://doomeer.com/factorio/#m1152Lbb4bbbbbbbbbbbbrgrgrgrgrgrgrrrrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrgrr20gr20grgrgrgrgrgrrrgrgrgrgrgrgrrgrrrrrrrrgrgrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgrrrrrrgrrrgrrrrrrrrrrgrrrrrrrrrrrrrgrrgrrrrgrrrgrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgrgrrrrrrrrgrrrrrgrgrgrgrg). 

As a tip for the future - don't be afraid to waste some space. There's generally enough of it to go around; it's one of the least expensive resources in Factorio. Not confining yourself to the ""minimum space needed"" makes design work a lot simpler.

The above notwithstanding, good job. :p

\---------------------------------

^(PS: Another tip: Keep in mind that the number of labs needed to consume \[x\] SPM depends on the cycle time of that particular research \[shown in research screen next to packs required\] and on your +% lab speed research \[can go up to +250% IIRC\]. In general, labs cost very little and don't drain much power even by early-game standards - if all your labs are running and packs are piling up on the feeder belt, build more labs.)",1533081838

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Sounds the only way an online group can become a ""hate group"" is to be the equivalent of Stormfront.

I prefer to use the SPLC definition:
    
    The Southern Poverty Law Center defines a hate group as an organization that ‚Äì 
    based on its official statements or principles, the statements of its leaders, or
    its activities ‚Äì has beliefs or practices that attack or malign an entire class of
    people, typically for their immutable characteristics.
    
    The organizations on our hate group list vilify others because of their race,
    religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity ‚Äì prejudices 
    that strike at the heart of our democratic values and fracture society along
    its most fragile fault lines.

Joining a sub-reddit that explicitly exists to spread racist, sexist, etc, views and then choosing to continue membership and participation in that group certainly counts with me as being part of a hate group.

Hate groups don't need to be massive and organized.  Sometimes they're just a bunch of people getting together in a common place to passively condone that hatred or harassment of some other group(s) of people solely due to some part of their person that is intrinsic.  Those are the most insidious of all.",1533081838

"mentalhealth","t5_2qirg","Some of the worst parts of being bullied can actually be from not having friends or a group that you can go to when you feel down.

The bully is as responsible for low self-esteem sometimes as much as the lack of positive reinforcement from others, such as a bad home life or a lack of friends. Oftentimes the reason bullies are bullies is because they themselves have low self-esteem, abusive family members, parents missing from their lives, etc. In a lot of ways, a bullies actions are a projection of their own bad experiences onto others. In other words, what they say is more of a reflection of their life, not yours. 

My point is, while it‚Äôs good that you feel they don‚Äôt have control over you anymore, take solace in knowing they likely never really did. Sometimes we can attach our own feelings to others and blame them when in reality it was what we believed about ourselves the whole time. Fighting low self-esteem is difficult and has many layers.

"funny","t5_2qh33","ISP factor is in large part due to government regulation and oversight and how poorly it was handled. Allowing monopolys via granting ownership public infrastructure and mandating certain policys. 

You can create a isp centered on a smaller area with out exuberant cost BUT government mandates to ensure smaller areas had coverage as well. Made the minimum isp size too large for any start up. 

For healthcare people travel thousands of miles to see a particularly good specialist or get cheaper care. While it may not be the case in emergency care people travel for cheaper care as well. 

I am not saying a free market is the final solution what I am saying is government has huuge problems within it operation structure. And free market has huge problems. 

It will be easier to fix those problems without merging them into a larger one. 

For example healthcare open pricing currently they operate with a we don't tell you till we give you bill policy. As well as price collusion inbetween hospitals. If we were to mandate a one price for all clients for procedures, obliterate and very harshly go after hospitals for price fixing/collusion. Right there I bet you would see as much as a 30% drop in prices. 

Now comes patents they are important and creators do need to be rewarded. BUT structure needs to change for example insulin in order to maintain monopoly they slightly change formula. Which should not be allowed. 

Length of patent should also be shortened drastically 5-7 years and only maintained available if they allow low income programs like medicaid to receive it for cost. However they should receive 5-10% of profits of any money made off drug once it goes public. For the full 20 years. Patent changes combined with pricing transparency bet you could reduce cost by as much as half. 

Now you get government to operate efficiently where they are accountable. With thing such as public books and a bounty on misappropriation discovery ect. 

As well as stabilization of tax revenue and we could operate one of most well funded cheapest healthcare systems in the world. 

I get what your saying and I DO not oppose single payer system. I oppose combining one broke system with another. Even if we were to address one or the other personally just feel combining broken with more broken is only going to result in more of a problem than the one we have. ",1533081838

Given the cinematic, I think Sylvanas did want to burn the tree initially but told everyone they would invade in order to please the other races. The elf confirmed her initial feeling that an occupation would be a half measure, so she decided to burn it like she initially planned. At least this is my theory.

What isn't a theory is that the occupation of the tree would be costly in materials and manpower. The Horde is already stretched thin from the losses sustained during the legion invasion. Burning the tree means no occupation cost of materials and manpower. So... yay economics?",1533081838

&gt; The family of Argentinian artist and activist Santiago Maldonado, who died following a confrontation with police at a Mapuche land protest last year, has called for a march to commemorate the first anniversary of his forced disappearance.

&gt; &amp;quot;Santiago&amp;#039;s brother, Sergio Maldonado, said:&amp;quot;Tomorrow we summon everyone to Plaza de Mayo, at 5:00 p.m., to demand truth and justice for Santiago and for all the disappeared in dictatorship and democracy.

&gt; On August 1 last year, Santiago - a 28-year-old fine arts graduate who had been backpackng around Argentina - was attending an Indigenous Mapuche protest against the seizure of ancestral lands by multinational fashion giant Benetton.

Does it really need to be said to proofread a correspondence to someone that just interviewed you for a job? I have to imagine that all the terrible thank you emails I've gotten over the years were proofread at least once and I'm sure the person sending it thought it was well-written, because the alternative would be silly.

I assume no one is purposefully putting errors in their thank you emails or haphazardly writing thank you emails and just popping them off.

Sending a thank you email is a no-upside, all-downside action and doesn't benefit anyone.

The only reason I bothered to say ""be careful"" is because some people just have an uncontrollable compulsion to send thank you emails. If you're one of those people, then I recommend sending a very short generic email.

&gt; Also hope that student doesn‚Äôt read Reddit. He or she could easily find out if this is about them. Your description of the student and his/her errors are detailed.

Clear-through penetrations are *very* nasty; like I said, a lot of the medic's duty is to figure out what can be triaged and get rid of anything beyond that to save the soldier's life. Armored vehicles face a similar issue: They've got spall liners, but if anything does come through it's going to be ugly.

The UNHA is pretty good at cybernetics and even growing organ-grafts. They do not have the technology to repair that kind of damage in-situ.

&gt; This made me think of a feature I forgot to mention for some reason, which is Field Medics having soft blue eyes and curved faceplates to appear non-intimidating on and off the battlefield. 

I hadn't included anything like that in my mind, but it's a good idea - especially if medics are potentially going to be aiding civilian populations, which sounds very likely given the Wraith threat.

&gt; And I like the triage foam! Inspiration from this I assume?

More a general ~~theft~~ adaption of any number of sci-fi medical foams. Halo, Firefly, and others served as an inspiration; the ""hardens under UV light"" is from an actual potential product I saw discussed once.

&gt; I see a major difference between our Medics is drugs mostly. ... I think that probably unconsciously stems from my mortal fear of surgery

It does. I'll maintain some of my writing is just the natural outcome of armor like that, but I also admit I'm rather more concerned about drug dependency than surgery and it does affect my writing.

Both classes need a fair amount of ap, I feel people over exaggerate kuno's accuracy reqs. With the current meta ap/dr is king. If you need the accuracy I recommend building ap accessories and snag a tri/tet quitar if you come across an evasion user. 

As others have said kunos movements are difficult to master and in my opinion that's probably the most noticeable difference between the two. Of course the scale of pvp you intend to play will also be a factor. 

If interested here's some duels I had with Nayashe, who's a solid Maewha from Black Rose.

One of the most interesting side effects of Brexit may actually be some environmental improvements. For example, hill farming in places like Wales is heavily subsidized by the EU. The post-Brexit UK government is not likely going to have the funds to maintain the subsidy, which means a lot of hill farmers will likely have to give up their livelihoods. This is good for the environment as sheep farming is devastating for the ecology of hilltop ecosystems. The hills shouldn't be barren like they currently are, they should be forested. Sheep are too efficient grazers, meaning anything other than very hardy grasses can't survive in sheep areas.",1533081850

"news","t5_2qh3l","Engineer here. Trump isn't 100% wrong in that safety and weight are opposed to each other. The heavier a vehicle is, the more momentum it has and therefore the slower it decellerates in an accident, which results in lower g forces on the occupants.

This is why buses don't require seatbelts. When a car crashes it is common to see 10-30 g's. When a bus crashes it only sees about 3-5 g's because it has more momentum.

That being said, Trump is an asshole and we can trade a little increase in crash injuries in exchange for not getting cancer and destroying the planet.

There are definitely a lot of mechanics that are unique in DS2 like SM and durability, but I always felt like DS1 and DS2 were the most similar in terms of combat.  I suppose that‚Äôs mostly just due to the order I played the Souls series in (2&gt;1&gt;BB&gt;3 IIRC) and the weapons/playstyles I used.  I would say that DS2 is also closer to DS1 in that it‚Äôs somewhat less linear than DS3, although DS3 definitely has it beat in terms of level/world design and references to the original.  Some parts of DS3 almost felt like they were just rehashes of DS1 areas.  I guess after typing it all out like this I would agree DS3 is overall more similar to DS1 than DS2 is.  That being said, I still think DS2 is the best place to start, so you can play it with an open mind instead of comparing it to DS1, if nothing else.  ",1533081850

Gobs were also seeking asylums from the Alliance after they were mercilessly assaulted. That doesn't mean they wouldn't sell you out for a handful of gold though. 

Belfs, while powerful, are low in number and aren't really committed to the Horde as they were just considering leaving to join the Alliance a few years back before they got their feelings hurt. They are not trustworthy. 

Trolls or rather the Darkspear, are yet another low population group of refugees. They also have some weird religious things going on that aren't really understood by the rest of the horde.

So that leaves the Tauren and the Orcs. It is easy to see why Garrosh would want the Tauren in the Horde as they are the only race that conducts themselves honorably within and with commitment to the horde. ",1533081851

"residentevil","t5_2s0lb","RE2 was terrifying for me back during my childhood, but it just doesn't have that same kick after all these years. The only thing that Resident Evils 1-CV have to offer anymore is a feeling of tension and panic, not horror, something that I can get 10 times fold in RE4. 

REmake however, can still, genuinely terrify me no matter how many times I play it over, it's just unsettling, along with that tension I mentioned before. Lisa Trevor is still one of my favorite bosses throughout the entirety of gaming, probably because she's just haunting, and terrifying, and looks the part. If Lisa was in the original RE, she probably wouldn't be half as scary. There's a difference when I'm immersed, and when I'm just staring at pixels

The reason RE4 was so much more successful than 5, and 6, was because it's a barebones survival game, in the same way that the Original games were. Except, now there's always tension, you're always at the edge of your seat, you're always wary of reloading even when your enemies are down, cause you know it's only a matter of a second, and you get hit, and now, there's someone else you have to worry about. 

A lot of people say that RE4 lacks horror, but it honestly had genuinely scary moments, chapters 2-1, and 2-2 had a surprisingly haunting atmosphere, you never felt safe, even though you've gone through these areas before, I guess it could be that you couldn't see 2 inches in front of you, or that they put traps on the floor in areas you've already explored to keep you on your toes.

 The Verdugo boss made me feel like a prey being hunted, and I felt helpless my first time through, an experience that I had only experienced with another boss in a different game, you know who I'm talking about (hint hint her name starts with L hint hint).

 In Chapter 4-3, the idea that this cart was taking me straight to hell sent chills down my spine as the QTE to jump appeared, neat stuff. 

And finally, regenerators. They personally didn't scare me, but I know a lot of people who have been scared by them. U-3 was also scary to a degree

TL;DR, REmake is more immersive than the other classics, and RE4 is not just mindless action like 5, and 6

What is the ClaimsPrincipal.Current and why shouldn't you use it for asp net core?

How does authentication with claims work, and how is it different to role or permission based authentication?

Why should you put a load balancer / reverse proxy in front of kestrel?

How do you manage sessions in a load balanced envrionment with .net core?

*****
&gt; The ruling party in South Africa, African National Congress, will submit a proposal to amend the country&amp;#039;s constitution to help push through its land reform, the country&amp;#039;s President Cyril Ramaphosa told the nation on Tuesday.

&gt; Almost one-third of the arable land on South Africa is privately owned, and white farmers own 72 percent of it, compared to only 4 percent from the majority black population.

&gt; During his Thursday address, Ramaphosa said the reform would &amp;quot;Unlock economic growth by bringing more land in South Africa to full use&amp;quot; and let millions more contribute to the nation&amp;#039;s economy.

Also, I have done many inspections to meet D 17.1 from WPS to Visual and other NDE inspections. The CWI exam is more to show competence with written specifications. 1/3 of the test is general knowledge, 1/3 of the test is to a fake code, and the last 1/3 is to an actual code.

"dresdenfiles","t5_2s64c","Because this isn't the only thing that has hit Murphy?  She was demoted from head of SI.  She lost her job.  Neither of which she has gotten back.  Sure, you'll say, that isn't a physical stake.  But considering that it's a core part of her personality - and not just out-of-universe - but, in fact, primarily IN-UNIVERSE it has been described as being a core part of her - that's a huge loss for her character.  

And getting upgrades is not a free continuity reset.  Becoming an Einherjar would certainly means she would no longer appear unless by ""chance"" (though from an out-of-universe perspective, obviously this would definitely come to pass) and would certainly mean a change in responsibilities and actions required that would prevent her from acting as she did previously.

And at the end of the day, I have to completely disagree with your base premise, which is that characters should be dying more frequently for greater impact.  I feel that in many cases, once it becomes a common and known occurrence, it actually decreases the investment in new characters, since at any moment they could just die.  I think that by having characters frequently NOT die, that actually makes the (in my opinion inevitable) death of a character who has thus far not died far more impactful.  I am of the opinion that The Dresden Files will end happily for very few of the big characters.  They are far too involved, with stakes far to great, for everything to just end happily ever after.  I expect essentially all the higher-level characters to all die by the end, with Harry certainly dying at some point near (or at) the end himself.  And these deaths will be more impactful beause they've managed to avoid death this long.  We will have had 5-6 MORE books of investment than we had previously.  Murphy and Dresden will have finally actually had a (brief) relationship.  ",1533081856

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","How can you.. I hate this mentality.

Unconditional love is nonsensical and goes against everything your inner-being will tell you. You have the absolute right to **not** forgive someone else and be better for it. Intolerable behavior is just that, and does not deserve a second thought. 

I'm not talking about punishment or retaliation, my point of view is that people who undergo such actions that clearly undermine your self-respect, self-esteem, (mental) health or morals and values *have no place around you.* Abuse should not be tolerated, and far too often people 'forgive' such digressions because they feel like they're losing something if they don't. Worse yet, religion that teaches you're supposed to forgive them (under the guise of 'it's better for you') enable this sort of thing.

&gt; I know this is ooey gooey, but I honestly believe that's how this thing works. That's what makes relationships work and fail.

It sounds admirable but I've come to think this is just based on self-deception. You move past other people's flaws so far, that whatever they may do, you'd still support them. That is not admirable, that is spineless and amoral. Nobody deserves a free pass from their actions and you really should stop loving someone when they are actively undermining your core being in favor of their own. Their selfishness should not be repaid with love. Instead, your refusal to continue a relation with such a person may well serve as a wake-up call for them to **be better**.  It's not a minor thing betraying your partner like that.

What really would be better is to grow a spine, tell these people to 'wisen up' to their behavior lest you cut them out from your life if at all possible. 

&gt; But you must forgive. Withholding forgiveness accomplishes nothing.

You move on, forgiveness is an afterthought you might chuckle at and if you don't at all care then go ahead and forgive. Betrayals such as what the OP is talking about, to me, do not deserve the courtesy, and I'll be fine by not looking back. Those actions have consequences and they need not look for forgiveness from me. Perhaps if they really wanted it they'd become a better person in trying to attain it. Probably not, either way - i'd cut them out of my life and move forward.

You're welcome to your point of view, please don't see my disagreement as an attack of any sort. I like that people have such different opinions and it's very interesting to me to see how people come to such conclusions. Perhaps I'm missing something key that you've figured out regarding the topic, and I'm always open to opinions - I may disagree, though.",1533081856

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","I think Arsenal is positioning itself as a legit squad and it will heavily rotate a squad of 16-17 players. I think when the team settles into a scheme it'll heavily lean 442. when laca, ozil and aubameyang are on the field, that likely means ozil will be expected to track as a wide midfielder. this has been pretty unsuccessful in the recent past so I dont imagine they will play much together in games where Emery expects not to dominate possession. 

I also think people are expecting a bit much for torreirra out of the gate. the way this fanbase is fickle I think it can really change his turnout. 

for instance, Xhaka played pretty well towards the end of last season. everyone ignores that it could have been he saw the Wenger writing on the wall and wanted to start auditioning for a new coach. I personally think Xhaka will play best in a 3 this year and surprise a lot of people, whether he is with mkhi, ramsey, elneny or torreira. I'm very optimistic for this season.",1533081856

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","100x this. I was on SIX psychiatric meds simultaneously at some point because my psychiatrist focused on symptoms instead of looking at the big picture. I'm now down to three but withdrawal from some of the medications was absolute hell (Cymbalta really messed me up). I was treated for Bipolar II, severe depression, anxiety, OCD and ADHD. Now that I know more about C-PTSD it is obvious that all my symptoms fall under the same umbrella. 

My first therapist helped me realize that many of my symptoms were related to my childhood but she wasn't a trauma therapist and she still mostly saw me as a patient with depression/bipolar II. I am glad that I've now found a therapist who specializes in trauma and attachment. She's trained in EMDR too. Before I started therapy I would have never used the words ""abusive"" or ""neglectful"" to refer to my family because it was all I had ever known, and I had convinced myself I was the one who was defective and didn't deserve to be loved even by my own family. Finally facing the trauma for what it is has brought up a lot of uncomfortable feelings (anger, mostly) but I know it's necessary for my recovery. There's still a long road ahead...

I was made to believe that absorbing a crazy amount of chemicals every day was the key to my recovery. All the multiple diagnoses made me feel so broken and defective. I cannot help but worry about long-term effects, too (especially having been on benzos for so long. I still haven't been able to quit those because the rebound anxiety is so delibitating).",1533081858

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt",""" that's literally how you spend the vast majority of your life... being married. That's a big wide circumstance. "" -wow, I am going to have to live an extremely long time then, not having married yet. I have nothing against marriage, it's something I've always wanted, but I haven't found the right person yet. Not everyone does, and others just don't want to get married. 

While I don't personally go for casual sex with lots of people, if that is the lifestyle someone else enjoys, as long as it's all consensual/legal, then good luck to them. People are different, and what makes one person happy makes another miserable. For instance, if a potential future partner of mine expressed disdain for my having slept with someone before them, that would a) hurt me emotionally and b) demonstrate they're not the person I want to spend my life with. 

 I am fairly sure many of the pitfalls you cite are a case of correlation not equalling causation. For example, higher divorce rates: a person who has had more sex partners before marriage has probably had more relationships in general - they may be less likely to stay in a relationship where they're unhappy. It isn't necessarily due to the sex itself. There's also the fact that many people who practice abstinence before marriage are the same ones who don't believe in divorce, which doesn't necessarily mean they're happy or in love.",1533081858

&gt;they never claimed it to be after gays for being gay. How can it be a hate crime, would it make any difference if they did it on tinder?

Yes, it would be different. Grindr is an app specifically for gay people. They used this app to lure out gay people, and they themselves are not gay. Unless they somehow think that gay men are easier to pick on than straight men, the logical conclusion is that they're out to bash gays.

&gt; Until proven that they have something extremely against gays, they have their own evidence posing as a minor attracting an elder man.

Except they don't. All the males in this were of or above the legal age of consent, only the female was under (at 15) and they were luring out *gay men*, so I hardly think she was used as bait.

Hell, even if they were posing as children, that doesn't mean they were trying to 'catch' paedophiles, as they bashed and robbed the person who came to meet them. That clearly indicates they were targeting a group that would be unlikely to report them to the cops, ie. a surefire way for them to commit their crimes with no repercussions.

Even if they were doing it out of some misguided sense of justice, that still doesn't give them the right to bash &amp; rob paedos. They should've just passed the info on to the police and let them deal with it.",1533081859

If you tally unarmed, toy weapons, and unknown, there were 120 instances of unarmed people being shot and killed by police. I've only heard of BLM protesting black victims, so we'll need to narrow that down a little further. According to the data, 1/5 victims were African-American (total). So there are around 24 more-than-likely unjustified fatal police shootings they can protest every year.

It's called percentage. We aren't talking about whether or not there is a tax cut or not.

&gt; Do you know WHY that is? The way they word it is to confuse you and get you emotionally charged, which is what the source you're citing is known for.

In 2002, tax specialists who had served in the Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Bill Clinton administrations established the Tax Policy Center to provide analysis of tax issues. The following year TPC developed a tax simulation model to analyze the federal income tax and proposals to change it. That model has evolved to incorporate new and additional data, changes in federal tax law, and other aspects of the tax system and the economy. TPC is funded by individuals, corporations, trade groups, and foundations including the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation. 

https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/sites/default/files/annual-reports/2016_tpc_annual_report.pdf 
 
&gt; They don't reference the percentage or salary of who they are comparing that 95% to so as to confuse you.

Yes they do, it's right below the graph in the footnotes.

&gt; Percentiles include both filing and non-filing units but excludes those that are dependents of other tax units. Tax units with negative adjusted gross income are excluded from their respective income class but are included in the totals. The income percentile classes used in this table are based on the income distribution for the entire population and contain an equal number of people, not tax units. **The breaks are (in 2017 dollars): (20% - $25,400); (40% - $49,600); (60% - $87,400); (80% - $150,100); (90% - $217,800); (95% - $308,200); (99% - $746,100); (99.9% - $3,587,300)**.

But I digress, it seems like you don't like to take other's numbers as anything other than false. So here's the official government's break down from the Joint Committee on Taxation: https://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&amp;id=5054

Those making less than $10K will have an average rate change of just .5%, while someone making $1M will see 2.3%. People making between $500K-$1M will see a 3.1% reduction. People between $30K-$50K will see .9%-1%.

&gt; Let's just say it's $40k. After taxes of 25%, that person takes home $30k. If they get back $4k more, or 10%, $4k of $30k is 13.3%. So you can say that this middle class individual is gaining 13.3% of their after-tax salary back.

&gt; Now let's take someone that makes $300k. Their tax rate is 40%. That takes them down to $180k after-tax. If they also get 10% of their pre-tax salary back just like the person that got a tax break on $40k, they'll get $30k back. now divide $30k by $180k . It's 16.7%. So the person making $300k gets the same pre tax percentage back of 10%, but because they have more taxes taken out to begin with, their after-tax increase is higher than the person making $40k.

This isn't even remotely how it works. Someone who makes $40K goes from 25% to 22%. That's a $1,200 difference. Not $4K. You are literally just making up bullshit numbers, which you accuse these other groups of doing. But this number will also change due to other tax credits/deductions. Or the loss of certain ones. You fail to recognize the sheer number of other deductions/savings that are possible for the rich that middle and lower class people will rarely, if ever, get to use. Changes to things such as Estate tax, Pass-through, or Capital Gains, for example. Per your own example, someone making $300K, goes from 39.6% to 35%. They are getting way more back than the guy making $40K in terms of percentage.

&gt; NOW, compare that with two small businesses that make $40k vs. $300k. They both have the same corporate tax rate which was the highest in the world.

Sure, they have the same federal rates, but larger corporations have many more ways for reducing their taxable income than a small business does. The biggest businesses in the US, pay probably like low 20% on average, even though the rate was 35% during that time. 

You live in some fantasy trickle-down dream land if you think that lower/middle class citizens and small businesses are getting the same benefits that the rich/ultra-rich and large corporations are getting. We have years of data on it, and you just pretend like everyone is lying and things are just peachy.

I can't even take you or your response seriously.

My best friend through middle school and half-way through high school. She was so cruel my mom would constantly ask me why I let her say such awful things to me. ""What? That's just how she is. She doesn't mean it.""

At the time it was written, citizens owned their own cannons and ships of the line, and were generally better equipped than the military. None of your arguments hold any water, none of them actually accomplish anything beyond security theater, and only the most authoritarian of bootlickers would consider applying them to *any* civil right or liberty. Goddamn, you ought to be ashamed. You'd stomp all over the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendments, give up the rights of your fellow citizens, all so you can maintain your illusion of security.

&gt; An alleged neo-Nazi was acquitted by a German court Tuesday for a bombing 18 years ago targeting Jewish immigrants, in what angry victims&amp;#039; advocates called a historic &amp;quot;Legal mistake&amp;quot;.

&gt; Duesseldorf police had questioned Spies and placed him under surveillance soon after the bombing before determining they did not have enough evidence to arrest him.

&gt; A breakthrough in the Duesseldorf case came in June 2014 when a prison inmate told police that Spies - who was briefly in jail over an unrelated offence - had &amp;quot;Bragged&amp;quot; about masterminding the attack, using an anti-immigrant racial slur.

Brienne said ""bloody woman"" not because she or the writers were sexist, it's to rile up Jamie, who enjoyed all sorts of privilege as the eldest son and the famous knight of Lannister, by ironically using the sexist Medieval notion everyone is participating in.

She also speaks her resentment that she was born female in the Westeros society since Brienne was suffering too as a female knight for her entire life, urging him to not die just because he lost the most important thing for his identity as a knight. If Brienne can be a successful knight despite being born without the most important part of the knight, Jamie can. This is a great use of thematical irony and subtext the people here would sing praises for the nuance of GRRM the show is lacking if this was a book dialogue.

"Muse","t5_2qz0k","Here are the albums in order from oldest to newest

Showbiz: Awkward and we love it. Has a mix of slow song, heavy songs, and a lot of unique guitar and bass

Origin of Symmetry: A mostly heavy album that experiments with the electric guitar the most. A fan favorite album among here

Absolution: A piano heavy album, evenly balanced between heavy and slow songs

Black Holes and Revelations: Muse experimented with their music quite a bit here. They have some Electronica, some drum heavy songs, and a western style tone to this album. One of this subreddit‚Äôs favorite album

Resistance is their most classical album. There are strings in almost every song on this album, but there are a few headbangers too.

The 2nd Law is their most experimental. Mixed with hard rock, dubstep, opera, and a lot of other elements. It‚Äôs my personal favorite, but this sub doesn‚Äôt like the album as much as I do

Drones is completely focused on the guitar. Although there are song soft closers at the end, it is their heaviest album

Most fans say go to songs in Origin of Symmetry or Black Holes and Revelations, but I say go where you want",1533081868

What kind of camera would I use for something like this? Ideally something small and easy to program. Or if I can just use any old camera and just check for RGB values- if it's fully blank or if there's a bit of colour coming from the logo.

I had an awd r32 (not a gtr, gts4) and it was a pig to drive since it had an rb20. If you desperately need awd for snow or whatever then stick with it but rwd v8 is so much better it's not comparable.

Everything sent over the internet is broken down into little collections of data (called a packet) and then sent like a letter -- with a destination ""address"".  The process of getting a packet to a particular address is called routing.

Routing is super complicated in detail, but in concept it's pretty simple.  Imagine you're trying to pass notes in math class: you look to see if it's for you, and if not you hand it off to a friend that who's closer to the desired recipient.  Your note bounces around for a while but eventually ends up at its desired destination.  Your ISP does the same thing but at a larger scale -- messages arrive over the wire from your house to a router in their data center and that router figures out where to pass the messages (via a routing table) so they get closer to the destination.",1533081869

A town wide one is relatively rare. What will happen is your property tax rate will keep creeping up, everyone will be angry about how high the rate is, the town will order a re-assessment, everyones houses are now worth 50% more, and they slash the tax rate in half, saying ""Hey, we cut property taxes"" however the vast majority of people are paying about the same.

If its happening on a city wide basis more than every 15 years, your town government is fucky.

For an individual, they may be triggered by you pulling a permit for a major improvement, by a sale well above what its current assessed value is (if you are in the ballpark of what your house is assessed at it won't), or if a bunch of things in your immediate area suddenly are worth a pile of cash more.

Also HOW you are assessed is different everywhere. Most places don't care how fancy the finishes in your kitchen are, just that your house has a kitchen. Number of bedrooms\baths, if your basement is finished, your sq footage, and how much land you have and its location drive pretty much 90% of the calculation.

You can always attempt to fight your current assessment if you believe you have a legit gripe, but the housing market in bergen is very strong right now so you would need one hell of an argument.

Edit: Also worth pointing out, an APPRAISAL is somewhat different than an assessment. For instance, if you have a  run down messy house, your yard is shit, your roof looks a little questionable, you will appraise at a much lower price than a house that all of that stuff is in tip top shape with. Because an appraisal is what someones opinion is of what the market would treat that house then and there for.

The assessment is better though of as the true value of your home if all of that stuff was up to snuff, because your town assumes you don't live in a trashed house with a leaky roof, and even if you did, it could be re-mediated quickly raising you back to that assessed value.

Likewise your town also recognizes that just because your place is hot on Zillow this week and their value shows it as being worth 100k more than you are assessed at, it still isn't a true representation, and they can't expect to re-balance the books constantly with every swing of the market.

If you live in a place where your cat can go outside and find animals to eat that could be an explanation. Also cats tend to find odd places to drink from so again if he is an outdoor cat you may not see him drink.

However if he is an indoor cat it's a different story. If there are no other sources of water than the bowl(s) you put out for him and the water level doesn't change much that is a bit of a red flag.

There is a long list of problems that can occur if the cat is not getting enough fluids. What is his diet like? Is he getting a lot of fresh food or just dry? If he isn't getting fresh food, try that. Preferably something watery of course. Make sure the water is fresh and clean, you could try and see if he will drink when you leave the tap running. You can also buy a water fountain, some cats prefer drinking water that is moving.

Best of luck

*****
&gt; An Aeromexico flight departing from the northern Mexican city of Durango crashed near the airport upon take-off, at approximately 15:20 local time, Mexican authorities said.

&gt; The governor of the state of Durango, Jose Aispuro, confirmed on Twitter that an accident had ocurred at the Guadalupe Victoria Airport of Durango.

&gt; &amp;quot;It was raining, there was a storm, I think they tried to halt the take-off but they did not manage to land on the tarmac. It fell where the tarmac ended and that is what caused the fire, as well as serious damage to the plane,&amp;quot; Aispuro said to Mexican broadcaster Televisa.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Just adding thermal mass to the refrigerator/freezer doesn't save any energy. It will reduce the rate of temperature change but the compressor will have to do just as much work to cool down an object place in the freezer as it would without the extra mass. It's just that some of that work was done in cooling down the extra mass before you added the new object. This is also ignoring the wasted energy of cooling jars of water, then removing them to make room for other items. It does reduce the number of start cycles, but that's not what's going to kill the small induction motor in a mini fridge.

However, there **is** an advantage gained by displacing air in the fridge that would otherwise be exchanged with warm air when the door is opened. If you ever here a sucking sound (and it's much harder to open) after you close the door, that's the warm air that got inside reducing in volume causing room air to be sucked in via the condensation drain to equalize the pressure (further warming the inside). Volume taken up by something other than free air will reduce this effect.

The most optimal solution is to keep the fridge filled with *items you already want to use cold*. If you like chilled rice milk, keep those container in the fridge instead of jars of water/bricks. If you find yourself having to remove the rice milk to make way for other items, then you should be using the lowest thermal mass displacement objects so the least energy is wasted when you need to remove them. I believe bags of hydrogen gas would be the best in ideal circumstances. Hydrogen tends to leak out of things easily so that would be a problem. The most practical would be bags of air. Even better would be a robotic arm the delivers an item to an air lock chamber with expanding rubber walls that envelope the item to displace as much cooled air as possible back into the fridge, then opening to the outside so you can retrieve cooled the item.",1533081873

Since you've given me no reason to believe you'll address any of the earlier comment, I only have one question for you. 

Why do the NFL owners and the viewers who oppose it, think kneeling during the anthem to protest systemic racism  is a negative thing that needs to be banned?

it's pretty obvious why the two leagues are viewed in different lights. If you can't realize that there's a bit more context to the two situations than just people putting their knee on the ground while a song is playing before the game, then i wish you a good day. ",1533081873

Update on my progress, I spoke to a recruiter last Tuesday for a few hours (actually, I spoke to three in the same office), even took the practice ASVAB. Two of the recruiters I spoke to were fully willing to let me schedule the ASVAB, but the third (their boss, also the first one I saw upon stepping foot into the office) came around to tell me that I cannot take the ASVAB until I can commit and enlist.

Numerous people I have spoken to have told me he simply wanted me to enlist and that I should be allowed to take the ASVAB (the two other petty officers I spoke to were caught off guard when he said that). I did get a call back from one of them the next day when at work saying he spoke to his boss and that they are willing to get behind me as far as weight goes (I thought I was 5'11, but I am apparently 5'9, meaning I'm much farther from the maximum weight requirement than previously thought and so that was their concern). Mentioned nothing about the ASVAB in the voicemail, so I'm willing to bet if I speak to them again they will say exactly what I was told when I physically went into the office.

The experience was a bit discouraging, even a year in advance, though since the ASVAB is universal I might suck it up and take it through another branch if I have to, since it seems like the boss of that particular office only cared about his quota and any other offices for the Navy are beyond reasonable driving distance.

"Naruto","t5_2quts","I don't think they did have a big ceremony. Sasuke at that point isn't a very well liked guy liked Naruto. Naruto's wedding was so large because he and Hinata are international heroes, she's from a large and powerful family, he's the future Hokage, and they have lots of friends and family which would justify such a wedding.

Most people I know opt for much smaller weddings and most of those just literally go to a court house. Given that Sasuke and Sakura don't have large families to consider and Sasuke isn't that well liked, why have a big wedding when they probably just need to go to a court house and get documents signed.

On the *other* hand if you make it to that office/professional role then suddenly you can schedule half days for doctors appointments or leave early for the bank, you can do your finances or write a personal email on the clock, you can mosey around and see what Johnny across the hall is up to and look at your cell phone whenever.

"survivorrankdownv","t5_3j46a","To expand on this defense writeup a little bit: Frank being an awful person politically is pretty much indubitable. BUT. All those quotes and Frank's general social interactions throughout the season make me think that Frank really only clings to like insane conservative gun nut politics because he doesn't understand people. He can't effectively socially interact without rigid boundaries and social roles set out to help him along and he clings to anything that gives him structure because really, there's not much else a Frank Garrison can do with their life. It's a shame that the specific things that help him and bring him comfort are so damaging to the society as a whole, but Frank is never a malicious person in Africa. He just *is*. He mostly is in the wrong way but he doesn't set out to do harm to anybody, not even Brandon.

So call me out for centrist politics if you will. But I wanna note that if I wanted to just Cancel whoever's politics I find deplorable that'd frankly be a way wider net than just Frank and he wouldn't be nearly the first person on the list.",1533081876

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Not real life or death persecution here in America. We're very privileged here, and we have been greatly blessed as a nation. However, I see signs with the way things are ""progressing"" in this country that cause me some concern. I get more and more fearful of keeping my job (or finding one) if it came to light my historically held Biblical Christian views on homosexuality and transgenderism.

With the differences in political ideologies widening in this country, I think a few things will probably happen. Right now conservatives are riding the ""Red Wave"" with Trump and Republican controlled government.  When the ""Blue Wave"" finally hits (and it will eventually, all things being cyclical) and we have a ""progressive"" controlled government, I think there is going to be a backlash against conservatives and especially Christians. (Not all conservatives are Christian btw.) I also think that unless things change (and I don't believe that they will considering ""the heart of man deceitful above all things and desperately wicked"" Jer 17:9) that another civil war is inevitable in the next 50-100 years. I think there will be definite persecution if things fall apart that badly. Of course this is all speculation, but historically every empire falls. And we're about due...

But yeah, I believe I'll see at least the beginnings of real persecution in the US during my lifetime. If not, I think that my kids and grand kids definitely will. I'm not worried about it for myself for the most part. I worry for my kids, of course. It's going to suck. However, Christ warned us that it would happen. It shouldn't be a surprise that we would be persecuted because of Him. To your last question, I just plan to ""keep on keepin on."" I pray that when the time comes, God will give me the strength to endure to the end. I pray that for my children and grandchildren as well.

On a related note, I saw this article just today and thought it was pretty good. https://au.thegospelcoalition.org/article/australian-church-leaders-prepare-people-persecution/

Folks should give it a read as it relates to these questions to a certain extent. (In Australia as opposed to America, but really applies to the whole Church.)

The king's men found them, killed everyone, kidnapped the queen, and the same guard from before(Darryl Tarrant) managed to get Ana out of there.

Ana's mother was publicly executed, her head put on display above the city's gates. Darryl told Ana everything, and together they fled to the neighboring country where Darryl had some old family contacts. Together, they plotted to overthrow the king, and over the next five years Ana learned a bit of subterfuge.

Currently, she has attached herself to our group's fighter, who is a lesser noble from her homeland. She intends to use magic to make the king paranoid, to kill off his supporters, to gain the fighter his trust, to plant evidence of a coup, and eventually when the king's enemies are at his gates, pull the strings to ensure her group is protecting the king personally, then assassinate him while their backs are turned.

While it's a modern example for the movie, the events within are well celebrated and also equally so known to have been false (if I recall, Panfilov actually survived as a POW only to attempt to claim the stipend he was due as a result of his wartime awards for his fictional heroics).

The Soviet portrayal of the ""Great Patriotic War"" is not one that anyone should take at face value simply because it's known to have been massaged and adjusted in many places.  One should also not fall into the trap of believing *ANY* of the German accounts for much the same reason, neither party had incentive for honesty in that campaign.

This should not be construed as trying to fall into the classic neo-nazi/revisionist lie of ""both sides"" in which everything is unknown and both the USSR and Germans equally criminal (although certainly not to deny criminality on the parts of the Soviets on many occasions), simply that when researching the Eastern Front it needs to be done with a cautious eye as a lot of propaganda remains as ""Truth"" post war.

2. What school is this?
3. Not that it really matters but... What are the circumstances that made you a dual citizen? It's possible that your birth and identity documents were issued by another country, and it's those things that might be giving the school a reason to treat you differently.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Take this for what it's worth.  I think that many Christians find themselves stuck in what I call old testament mentality. What I mean is that the Christian faith becomes deluded from the whole text and, while these individuals certainly believe in Christ, they hey trapped in the ""thou shalt nots"" or the ""thou shalts"" of the old testament, or for that matter, the new. It is my opinion that this is a trap that leaves the victim a slave to their faith rather than a follower. It is also my opinion that because these individuals feel they are following Christ as they should, they take Christ at his command to preach the gospel and, to them, the do's and don't do's of the bible, as they understand it, is the gospel, or at least the gospel they feel commanded to preach. 

I am sorry for your experiencing this. I don't post or comment very much here because of an experience a couple of years ago. Leet me share one final thing: these are the three things I believe about God. 1) God is love. No love can exist without God and, God's love is ever present and eternal, reaching out to all. 2) God is everything. Before him, there was nothing and out of him, everything came to be. 3) God is bigger than religion. Go to church to experience fellowship with other believers. Do the same with Reddit or any other means you choose but, God is within you. Experience his love.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","""quite split"" in Canada means a whole lot of fuck all. It's a multi party system, people always bitch about whomever is in office while they're in office. The system usually takes care of itself, and there is always another federal election in 4 or 5 years to ""fix"" the issue. 

Plus when we're satisfied with our current politicians they don't have to rush out the door after 8 years and can do a 3rd or 4th term. We aren't a people that are split down party lines, even with the brainwashing of the American TV rhetoric most Canadians still realise we're all in this together and it's not a me vs them deal when it comes to Canadian politics. 

We are a *much* more liberal and socialist country than the USA. We're not as socialist as the NFL, but we're still more for the good of the people than we are for the good of one rich fuck with delusions of being able to one day be that one rich fuck...

Trudeau lost a lot of his non-base support after the India debacle, but it wasn't a screaming anger across the nation, it was just dissatisfaction in the polls. The guy made a lot of promises he hasn't kept *so far* and wouldn't get my vote if it were this year... but he's also done quite a few good things so far so he isn't ""hated"" by me *and* there is no other viable option right now that I'd vote for anyone. So I, like many Canadians, are still resigned to sit it out and see how things roll until next election. 

If he died tomorrow it would be a shame (he's a young man with a nice family -- regardless of his politics), but we'd get past it and there would be absolutely no instability in the country because of it. It would be ""business as usual"" under a new Liberal party chosen Prime Minister until the next federal election.

&gt; JULIAN Assange - the Australian WikiLeaks founder in self-imposed exile at a London embassy - wants the Turnbull Government to urgently intervene in his case as he faces the imminent prospect of expulsion from his refuge.

&gt; Ms Robinson said the UK Government had refused for eight years to give Ecuador an assurance Assange wouldn&amp;#039;t be extradited to the US. That assurance alone could bring an end to the long-running drama, which is taking an increasing toll on him.

&gt; Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said the Government was offering Assange consular support.

If your body really  has issues with the fluids it is producing for means of reproduction it will release them itself in your sleep in what's called a wet dream, they are commonly experienced with a sexually themed dream in which at the end you ejaculate both in this dream and in real life. Its normal to not wake up through this or to wake up respectively either way don't panic this is normal.

In capitalism you can choose a career, Bob wasn‚Äôt forced to take a $50,000 job. He decided to do that with his free will. And you think, you can force 300 million people, to take jobs they don‚Äôt want, and have a big unfair gap between the work required between jobs, not have iPhones or websites like Reddit or Youtube. 

Here‚Äôs a surprise, if people don‚Äôt want to work at a job they won‚Äôt preform good at it, the kid who had dreams of becoming a website developer, oh wait they won‚Äôt have websites in Communism. Okay let me say that again, the kid who had dreams of becoming a game developer, oh wait, they don‚Äôt have that job! Okay, the kid who had dreams of being the man that delivered bread to people isn‚Äôt gonna be happy making cars, while his best friend Jimmy gets to make propaganda cartoons, assuming they‚Äôll actually have TV in communism. 

Also, there won‚Äôt be as many jobs in Communism as in Capitalism. 

Also, you‚Äôre retarded if you think the 300 million people won‚Äôt revolt, you can‚Äôt just take away things people are used to having, such as a free market, and expect no rebellion. What are you going to do to those protesters? Send them to the gulags? 

If you want this ‚Äúuprising‚Äù to happen, prepare for it. Get off Reddit permanently, don‚Äôt play any games, don‚Äôt speak up against the government, don‚Äôt eat more than 1 meal a day, don‚Äôt buy anything you don‚Äôt need.

How about you sell whatever you don‚Äôt need and donate it to a person like Bob? Come on, you don‚Äôt need that car, or whatever device you‚Äôre using. Donate it to a guy like Bart who didn‚Äôt pay attention in school and doesn‚Äôt care about his education.

Here‚Äôs a challenge, prepare for Communism for a whole week. Don‚Äôt use anything ‚Äúnon important‚Äù such as your car or phone. Don‚Äôt play any games, all you do is work and sleep. See what it would be like to live in Communism, and remember you‚Äôre doing it for Bob, someone who didn‚Äôt apply for welfare or food stamps and didn‚Äôt pursue a higher paying job, had kids even though he only had $50,000 salary, whose wife doesn‚Äôt work so she can stay home all day. 

You can get a high paying job, do you think my immigrant family just got their money? No, they actually got a 6 figure paying job because they worked hard. 

Sometimes life is hard, but that doesn‚Äôt mean you quit. Hopefully it works out for Bob. Bob is strong, he keeps pushing forward, he doesn‚Äôt want to abandon something that has worked for thousands of years just because life is hard.

Decisions are often multifactorial and multidisciplinary.

Nurses are a great resource, however, the vast majority do not want to claim responsibility for contradicting physician decisions especially when there are so many cooks in the kitchen.  As far as medication mistakes and medical errors, if a nurse catches a mistake I buy them coffee or cake.  I am not proud enough to discount the opinions of 80% of the facility.  I also encourage the use of my first name with the nurses I know well.  To suggest that power distance index is the whole picture is missing the forrest for the trees.  A pro-life-tip is if your doctor seems to be dismissive of and mistreat their nurses and/or patients,  then you could be concerned that they will not be supportive of nursing input or may not garner support from their nursing staff.

I halved my grocery bill since I started doing IF, for me at least it's way cheaper. 

Also, figure out where you can cut excess calories without big changes. Stick to water, tea, or black coffee to drink. Bake things instead of frying them. Go easy on high calorie sauces, or find lower calorie alternatives. Count calories for a few weeks as you're eating now, *all* your calories, and figure out what in your current diet is adding more calories than it's worth. ",1533081888

Because when you lose that physical intimacy and whenever you try to broach the subject you are refused, however nicely, it still leaves you feeling neglected and rejected. I met my fiance on an online game and grew very close, eventually quitting my job and moving several states to be with her. It was hot and heavy at first, but grew less and less quite quickly until she told me she felt most of her life that she thought she may be asexual. I asked her if it was because she wasn't attracted to me anymore, and she assured me that wasn't the case, that I was the only man in her life that ever excited her sexually, and that whenever I wanted to have sex to tell her that's what I wanted whether she was in the mood or not. Since then, everytime I have tried to initiate sex with her, I am brushed off. I even followed her own wishes to tell her I wanted it anyway and merely ended with her in tears. We've devolved to the point of sleeping in separate beds, and while I know the love is there, the intimacy is not.  I work full time, come home to clean, cook, feed all of her animals, and the most I get is a peck on the lips and a thank you. I myself have been searching for a female pen pal, but alas have found none.

Since the vast VAST majority of magic shown is actually is simple wand waving, it is not unreasonable to assume the majority of healing magic is as well. In fact outside of the Skele-Grow ALL healing magic in the books is wand waving. 

I'm sorry but the burden of proof is on YOU to show that normal diseases are a problem, as there has never even been a hint of muggle disease mentioned or shown anywhere within the cannon of HP. We have seen them affect magical cures (regrowing bones)  far beyond what is available with the most advanced medicine in the muggle (our) world. It is not unreasonable to assume that the #1 killer of humans throughout history (communicable diseases) would have been cured or rendered impotent, if the time was taken to find a way to remove and regrow bones. 

Finally you can't have herd immunity if noone is vaccinated. If the magicals lived as our ancestors did with no vaccinations, and no reliable cure/deterrent there would be a significant segment of the population (since as you mention before, they have instantaneous planetary travel) that would die, or be disfigured/crippled and, once again, there is not a shred of evidence supporting that anywhere.

At first what gave me a new perspective was being grateful for the time I had with her instead of hopeless about the time I wanted and won't get. But that's a pretty shortlived feeling. Then I look for it as a way to appreciate my precious time here and my other loved ones time here, but that still didn't satiate the pain. I volunteered at some organizations she had a passion for in her life while I took time off working to deal with my grief. I go to a monthly grief group specific to her manner of passing (accidental overdose) with my parents and it has been the most comforting. Knowing that my tragedy and my grief is being put to good use ushering others in the same situation through this confusing heartbreaking process makes me feel like there's something good coming out of all this pain. 

I don't think there truly is an answer out there good enough, its a part of your story and I'm so sorry for your loss. I think this year we're going to release some butterflies on her birthday, and have her favorite meal, it's what we did last year",1533081897

&gt; In her book Inside AfD, which is scheduled to be released this week, Franziska Schreiber claims the domestic security chief met with Petry to discuss ousting Bernd H&amp;ouml;cke after H&amp;ouml;cke called the Holocaust Monument in Berlin a &amp;quot;Monument of shame.&amp;quot; Schreiber also claims that Maassen and Petry talked about how the party could avoid an investigation by his office.

&gt; The BfV strongly rebutted the claims with a statement as well, denying that the domestic security chief has ever spoken to politicians about internal party issues.

&gt; Critics of the AfD have claimed that it exhibits anti-constitutional tendencies and have called for it to be observed by the BfV. Maassen is said to have met with Frauke Petry - who left the party in September 2017 - to advise her as to how the party could avoid scrutiny from his office, something he wished to avoid.

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; I can dig this. I will have to revisits this later tonight or tomorrow. I want to read the links and prepare my questions.

Not a problem for me. I can't speak for TGBP.

&gt; Should we do this here or is it possible to do this in a closed thread to avoid trolls and such?

Might be a good idea -- hell, if you like, you could even create a sub for the purpose with you as sole moderator - inviting myself and TGBP as approved submitters, and set it to ""private"" or ""view only"" for anyone other than the three of us. (I think that is possible -- need to check!)

At least that way we wouldn't be seen as abusing the good graces of r/conspiracy, and if you so desired, you could delete the whole damn thing when when all is said and done.

&gt; I am not against sharing anything discussed, 

Agreed. I am more than happy to have anyone view. 

&gt; just feel it may be more productive to be able to have a civil discussion without distractions or someones ability to delete comments. 

Indeed. Consider the sub idea. If you think it's too much hassle, oh well, and in any case, In any case, we still need TGBP to agree to participate.

**EDIT**: I just created a test sub -- /r/Blabracadabra - just to check the setting capabilities.

Under ""Type"" you can choose from 

===============

**public** anyone can view and submit

**restricted** ***anyone can view, but only some are approved to submit links***

**private** only approved members can view and submit

**gold only** only reddit gold members can view and submit

===============

Restricted might be good - visible but Troll-Free? 

I don't know whether outsiders could comment. If you didn't want that, you could set the Spam Filters to ""ALL"", that way only comments YOU (as the sole mod) approve could be seen by anyone but YOU.

Setting it up is a no-brainer. Is it worth the hassle? That's up to you to decide.

Most of this is around Standard but some outrage spills to Wild.  Draw your entire 4 card OTK combo Turn 4 is pretty powerful, especially with Ramp.  And when you draw these cards out, it means you draw your other removal faster too.

For Standard, it is because Druid already had a super powerful card in Flobidious Floop and potentially Biology Project.  All of these cards synergize with each other to find Malygos or other combos in the future.  Then it got a bit bit worse when you have a decent 7-mana minion to draw (where you really didn't have one before). (Wild has the combo but Standard lacks good 7 and 10 drops)

On top of this, Druid is the 3rd most played class (2nd at Legend) with the most viable archetypes (Big, Taunt, Token, Malygos) in Standard.  Peope are fickle and don't like seeing the same classes, let alone same archetypes, be the ""top deck"" between Expansions.  ",1533081898

I hope not, and the same could be said about some of the other domain that have already been approved by the community in past... I just got here, and find this all very interesting.  It's critical that we all participate and voice our opinions in a constructive manner.  Your last comment, summarized from my perspective as ""I have a shit ton of tokens, resistance is futile"", is an interesting tactic... it could go either way I suppose.  Scares off voters for the challenge, maybe?, and the domain is committed to the registry... or, maybe you are presenting yourself as a token-bully (haha, just coined a phrase?) which will incite more resistance than would have naturally occured?

"AskStatistics","t5_2sioa","&gt; Isn't Wilcoxons the non parametric variant of the t test? Would that be better suited? I'm stuck and not really sure how to proceed.

A Wilcoxon signed rank test is a paired test; however, you have more than two measures on a subject.

I wasn't necessarily advocating for a rank based test (nor indeed for any other nonparametric test). It's not a case of ""assume normality or find a nonparametric test"" (indeed that's a completely unhelpful trap many books lead people into). There's other possibilities.

Instead I was trying to point you toward considering carefully what your response was and whether you could conceive of a reasonable model for the responses in the context of your experiment, about which you could then write two specific hypotheses and what assumptions you're prepared to make (at which point some consideration could be given to how impactful the assumptions might be). At that point you should have a basis on which to choose (/construct) a test.

I'm glad about the random effect thing -- that's likely to be sound advice (so often it's unsound advice that the OP has received).

&gt; My hypothesis is that subjects would prefer the harder option due to motivation (contrafreeloading).

This is a start but you actually need to specify what your recorded values consist of in relation to this question (whether the hypothesis is the case) and how your hypothesis relates to those collected values. More precisely, you need a *model*.


I am curious to know why you waited until *after* the experiment was conducted rather than asking about analysis first before collecting data. It's before the start that the statistical consultation is of the most potential value (since in many cases it can save an otherwise doomed study - and I've seen a distressing number of those. In Fisher's words ""*To call in the statistician after the experiment is done may be no more than asking him to perform a post-mortem examination: he may be able to say what the experiment died of.*""; I don't think that's the case here, but it's likely useful advice - e.g. over whether the sample size would be likely to be adequate - may have been given, and a suitable analysis pre-registered.)

"BrilliantLightPower","t5_3aw6b","I have seen a transmission line modeled as series inductors and shunt capacitors, so much per unit length.  This situation is a little different: where's the ground?

How would you model the capacitance of this superconducting, constant current loop?  If it has series capacitors, they are highpass and block all DC:  there is no signal.  If they are shunt capacitors, there is no ground to go to, and anyway they have an infinite impedance to DC signal trying to go through them to ""ground"".  So they can't divert current away from the main loop.  Really however you make the model topology, the capacitors are either going to present infinite or zero impedance since the frequency is zero and the impedance is 1/(jwC), where w stands for omega.  Maybe a lumped element circuit is just not the way to think about this problem even though it is low frequency.",1533081902

Otherwise, they could‚Äôve just been people who were found secretly under Xavier, and he‚Äôs used his gifts to allow them to never have been found all of this time.  Kinda like how Ghost has existed under Shield all of this time but was kept low key.  Perhaps the events of the snap, as well as the undoing of it, has changed their minds to stay hidden from the world, and they decide they want to join the world to help protect it.  Characters like Magneto and other villains could just simply be good guys to begin with, but basically become villains because they disagree with Charles and the idea of joining the rest of the world",1533081904

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","So, I'll come out and start with this: I'm having an affair. I'll also say [you should watch this Ted talk.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJv0TEcLapg) She does a lot to explain why people are unfaithful and what this means. She does it in a very non-judgemental way.

Why it started:

I recently met a woman through a volunteer organization. We hit it off immediately. Both of us thought of the other as attractive but nothing came of it. Then we started talking about our personal lives. For the first time in a long time we each found that we had someone who understood our problems. In both of our cases, we have a spouse who is either consistently demeaning (my case) or downright abusive (hers). We also have some strong and important similarities in family history and in interests. We tried to avoid physicality at first, but we just couldn't. Physical intimacy bloomed out of emotional intimacy naturally.

Why I have told (or left) my wife:

Several reasons. 

\- First, divorce is expensive. It will cost an additional $40k/year to support a second household without forcing my kids to leave or without me leaving them.

\- If I admit to the relationship, I will lose access to my kids \*and\* I don't trust my wife not to poison their attitudes. 

\- If I leave my wife, then I will lost most, if not all, of the friends I've developed over the last 14 years. Most of our friends are mutual friends. If I leave my wife, then those mutual friends will evaporate.

Summary:

\- The affair started because I am in a relationship which is actively painful. I have no good way of communicating with my wife so that I believe she is interested in my needs. I'm going to try to work around that. I'm going to try counseling (both personal and relationship, once I get through the self-esteem problems which are being triggered). But none of that changes the pain that I've already endured.

\- I don't have the ability to leave, or even admit to the affair, without massive financial and personal difficulties.",1533081905

One Hermetic maxim states, ""While All is in The All, it is equally true that The All is in All.""  The All can also be seen to be androgynous, possessing both masculine and feminine qualities in equal part.

With current tools:     
- it's trivial to serve up manipulated audio   
- google serves targeted web content and search results to each unique users based on their history and other characteristics*  

Which means its feasible to serve altered video content to *some users*, while letting other users hear the unaltered (or different) audio on youtube videos. One possible outcome might be for people to argue about the ambiguity of these effects, leading to doubt in our perception: ""it's just like the dress thing all over again! You're just hearing it differently, maybe it's your headphones?""    

I remember when bible changes were happening, and google cache was still displaying webpages with the old quotes for around 5-10 minutes after the live pages had changed.

a little blurb from my own life: 

when my brother‚Äôs girlfriend got pregnant at 17 just a few months ago, her Ndad threatened to expose the pregnancy and publicly call her a whore, he banned my brother from seeing her for a very long time, took away her phone for a few months because ‚Äúhe pays for it‚Äù, went through her texts via icloud (which my mom was disgusted about him doing.. ha) and nearly forced her to move back to their home country of DR. of course though, he puts on a show for everyone else and makes people believe he has the perfect family, despite what goes on behind closed doors. 

my mom constantly talks about how she couldn‚Äôt imagine someone torturing their own child like that.  but really mom? you would accuse me of prostituting myself and having sex with every man i interacted with. you outted me to my grandma. you‚Äôve taken away my phone for weeks and said that you can take it away whenever you want because you pay for it. you‚Äôve gone through my journals, texts and laptop. you attempted to force me into staying at home from college for this coming term so that i could ‚Äúclear my mind‚Äù from college life bc apparently i don‚Äôt do well there and am on a ‚Äúvery dangerous path‚Äù (even though that‚Äôs where i have the most friends, have good grades and a job). 

i‚Äôve never seen someone as angry as i saw her when i compared her to my brother‚Äôs girlfriend‚Äôs Ndad. she acted like i was the most ungrateful person in the world.

But it looks noticeably better on MAX settings, while still looking similar-ish on lowest, with very similar lowest requirements, and it runs on such toasters you could probably rob a junk from underfunded kindergarden office and it would work just fine.  


You are entitled to what you paid for. You paid for in-game bonuses, not holding the company accountable to you on every minor performance change. They keep this game working on horseshit you mentioned. You can build a ""rig"" to play this game on medium-high 1080p/60fps so cheaply, It's arguable you spent mo4re on the game. I'm sorry to break it to you, but you have to upgrade.

Toronto gets about $79/person from gas tax transfers. Ottawa gets $39/person. Hamilton, $20/person. Sault Ste Marie, $15.60/person. But, like with the property tax rate, it isn't fair to make an up-and-down comparison.

"history","t5_2qh53","Here are my critiques.

1. At 0.29, you said the mercenary army revolted after Carthage refuse to pay them. That wasn't the case. While it started with them not getting paid, Carthage eventually capitulated and want to pay them but their leaders decided that wasn't good enough anymore and got the rest of the Libyan army to join them in revolt against Carthage. It turn from a 'you didn't pay me' to 'I no longer acknowledge your rule.'

In 1.23, you said Hannibal was 'given' the command. The army actually acclaimed Hannibal as their commander, and sent recommendation to Carthage for their approval, which they did. 

In 1.25ish, you said Hannnibal pushed north and west towards the border Hasdrubal the Fair set down, the Ebro/Ibro.

See, Hannibal was pushing into the Olcades, where Saguntum is. Saguntum was south of Ebros, and ROMAN influence DID NOT REACH Ebro at this time. There is a HUGE space between New Carthage under Hannibal and Ebro, and then Ebro with the Roman influence zones. There were 2 huge buffer zone to ensure that conflict doesn't break out. In any case, Hannibal's push got him to about 100 miles of Saguntum. Hannibal also pushed north into the Vaccaei and captured Helmantica (Salamanca). But regardless, all Hannibal's action were still far from Ebro.

In 1.34, you said fearing an invasion, Saguntum allied itself with Rome. Except in Polybius we were told that this happen SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE Hannibal.

In 1.39 you said Hannibal SAW the treaty as a breach of sovereignty, in reality, that was not the case. Saguntum was in fear of their existence as Hannibal campaigned against the Olcades, and in civil strife, the factions that were pro Roman asked for Roman interference, and the Romans executed large groups of pro Carthaginian factions. Then, Saguntum confiscated land from the Edetani, who were Hannibal's allies. In short, Hannibal sent emissary to Carthage asking what should be done with the Saguntines who attacked Carthaginian allies and executed pro Carthaginian politicians and the senate replied that he do what he thought would be necessary.

Around 2:23, you said they left some small groups on untrained soldiers in northern Italy. There is no such thing as untrained soldiers for Rome who were stationed in the Po Valley. Especially when these soldiers just fought against a Gallic uprising. 

2:35 You said he planned to invade Italy in the middle of winter. We actually don't know if that was his plan. He did do it in the middle of winter, but more likely he moved when he find out some plan of his were in motion. Specifically, he need to make sure that his army wasn't stuck somewhere inland when Roman forces lands in north Africa. Hence, he was dragging his foot on his way towards Italy while the Roman fleet was still focused on invasion, the moment they decided to chase pirates is when Hannibal move towards the mountain, and it just happen that it was winter. 

Around 5:30, you said Romans lost so many man they had issue raising new legions. If anything was said about Romans in the Punic Wars, is that they KEPT raising new legions. 

Around 5:20, you said Hannibal had around 20,000 men. Is there a reason why he only had 20k men with him? What happen to the rest of his army? 

In 7:30, you said Varro raised 96,000 men. That simply wasn't the case.

Varro was elected with Paullus, and they raised 4 legions, but these were beefed up legions with 5,000 men each. They then link up with the army in the field under command of Servilius and Atilius who also commanded 4 legions - and their legions were also reinforced into buffed up legions. The Romans actually only raised 4 legions, and maintained 8 legions in the field for Cannae, that is, 40,000 men. The allies were requested to keep up with the legions and they also raised 40,000 men. Putting the Roman number at Cannae in the range of 80,000 men, including skirmishers and cavalry. I don't know where the other 16,000 men came from. 

Around 8 min you talked about Cannae. In the field, less than 80,000 took place in the battle. Paullus left 10,000 men to guard the camp, and these man went out to attack Hannibal's camp. Hence, the 2 legions that survived Cannae. 
Also, in the battle, both flanks of the army were protected by cavalry, around 6000 Spanish and Gallic on one side facing the 2400 Romans, around 4000 Numidian on the other facing 3600 Italians. The Spanish defeated the Romans first, then they wheel across the field into the Italians, and then after defeating both Cavalry from the Roman Army did they turn on to the Roman infantry.

Around 10 min, you said Carthaginian senate refuse to send reinforcement. This is the MOST common misconception of the Punic War. Carthaginian senate sent Hannibal multiple reinforcements, they also reinforce their armies in Sicily multiple times, Spain, Sardinia, etc etc. While the senate DID refuse Hannibal, they reasoning was in fact correct. Hanno asked Mago, after all Hannibal's effort, has there been any talk in Rome for peace? Has there any Latin allies who wanted to defect to us? What changed strategically now compare to prior the invasion? Nothing? Well, then Hannibal's strategy was clearly misguided then. If Cannae cannot turn around Roman head for peace, then very few things would. 

EDIT: Source found. Livy 23:12
~~Around 10:20, you have this senators saying a bunch of stuff. Can I ask the source?~~

In 10:54, immediately after the meeting between Hanno and Mago, YOU PULLED HANNIBAL FROM ITALY. You skip a DECADE of time. You need to at least inform people that time has pass. And we aren't talking about a year or two. 

In 11:02 you said Scipio seeing Hannibal was somehow in political trouble and started Zama? Sorry, you need to at least include the context prior to Zama.

When did Scipio land. Then what happened, was there a peace treaty? What happen to that peace treaty? Why did Scipio head out to the great plains. Why did Scipio head to Zama. Why did Hannibal head out to Zama. 

In 11:07, you said African elephants were his trump cards. I recommend reading on Hannibal before you talk about what was Hannibal's trump card. In any case, Hannibal deployed his elephants with his skirmishers, and they did not engage Roman cavalry on the flanks. 


So here are my criticism. I think you need to dig a bit deeper in to Hannibal's history, a bit more in depth and consult with sources. A lot of reason why people think Hannibal was great were DUE to the reasons you completely skipped. And a lot of your numbers were run and the whole thing felt rushed.  ",1533081909

&gt; The Metropolitan police commissioner has criticised hypocritical middle-class cocaine users who care about fair trade and organic food, but who she said are fuelling the drug trade.

&gt; Use of cocaine in England and Wales is higher than at any point in the past 10 years and the EU drugs agency has said purity of street cocaine is at its highest level in a decade.

&gt; The Tottenham MP, David Lammy, citing reports from Interpol and Europol, has said the white middle-class market for cocaine was booming at the same time that many of the killings were being fuelled by an increase in the movement of drugs, particularly the class A substance.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Reminder:   Pence was present on January 6, 2017 - pre-inauguration - when the intel community gave a briefing on their best intelligence, showing that Putin himself ordered election interference.  

CNN article Clapper discusses that briefing re Putin personally ordering the attacks.  But it wasn‚Äôt Trump alone who heard that.  The Vice President did, too.  He is as complicit in this as Trump is.  Pompeo, too.  

https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/19/politics/james-clapper-trump-russia-hacking-cnntv/index.html

&gt; Clapper told CNN's ""New Day"" that he and other intelligence officers briefed Trump, who was President-elect at the time, and his team on January 6, 2017. 

His team per this old article:

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/06/donald-trump-russia-hacking-meeting-intelligence-officials

&gt; Several advisers due to join Trump and Vice-president elect Mike Pence for Friday‚Äôs intelligence briefing included incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus; incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn; incoming deputy national security adviser K T McFarland; Thomas Bossert, Trump‚Äôs pick for homeland security adviser; and representative Mike Pompeo of Kansas, Trump‚Äôs choice to head the CIA.

To determine your correct exposure time, the best method is to use [an exposure calculator like the free one Anthem offers](https://www.anthemprintingsf.com/Screen-Exposure-Calculator-s/216.htm). They list basic starting times for a few different exposure unit types to get you started.",1533081912

This ignores the lower maintenance cost advantage of the Leaf, as well as the fact that I can get free recharging a bunch of places (e.g. the 110v wall outlet in the parking garage at work).

Your mileage will vary. :)

This entire campaign to take Darnassus was to break the Night Elves so she could solidify the Horde's control on the continent and thus the Azerite. The dying Sentinel just showed her how strong-willed they are and that taking the tree would have just caused more problems. She was hoping to have the Night Elf populous subjugated but then she realized she'll have to deal with an eventual uprising when the Stormwind fleet shows up,  pinching the Horde's army.

Her flashback only served to emphasis how strong-willed the Elves can be. She rebelled in death while under the Lich King's control and she just witnessed the Nightborne have a rebellion, it only makes sense that the Night Elves would have an uprising when the Stormwind fleet shows up.",1533081916

&gt;One of the questions directed to HRC tomorrow is from a woman with a rash,' Brazile wrote.

&gt;'Her family has lead poison and she will ask what, if anything, will Hillary do as president to help the ppl [people] of Flint.'

&gt;A woman named Lee-Anne Walters ended up asking the question.

&gt;'After my family, the city of Flint and the children in D.C. were poisoned by lead, will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to the citizens that have said service lines?' Walters asked.

And a question about the death penalty was given to her just one day prior to a debate with President Trump.

&gt;""Here's one that worries me about HRC,"" the email, addressed to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri, reads.

&gt;""19 states and the District of Columbia have banned the death penalty. 31 states, including Ohio, still have the death penalty. According to the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, since 1973, 156 people have been on death row and later set free. Since 1976, 1,414 people have been executed in the U.S. That's 11% of Americans who were sentenced to die, but later exonerated and freed. Should Ohio and the 30 other states join the current list and abolish the death penalty?""

I was pulled out of school halfway thru 6th grade. 
From 4th to 6th I got the shit kicked out of me, from anywhere from 2 kids to 6 kids at once. Multiple times a day. Just for being there. 
I was homescjooled up till 4th grade in a really strict Christian family, and didn't have many friends outside church. So I had no social skills, so I was that weird quiet homeschool kid. So I was a big target. 

One day I was in the bathroom, and walked out and the ringleader of all the kids that tormented me walked in. Saw me, shoved me against the wall and kneed me in the crotch and laughed. I laid there a few seconds, got up walked out before becoming so overwhelmed with rage I walked back in. He was standing at the urinal 10 feet from the door, I sprinted full speed and slammed him face first into the chrome pipe above the urinal. 

Walked out without a word and got 10 feet from the bathroom before his best friend came up and shoved me to the ground, kicked me in the stomach and laughed. I just smiled and told him Aaron needed him in the bathroom. Struggled to my feet and got in line for my class. 2 or 3 minutes later I had the worst beatdown ever. The best friend and like 6 other kids just kicked the shit out of me In front of like 4 lines for 4 different classes. No one came to my aid or anything. They let up after a few seconds and I got to my feet. I remembered bleeding from my lips and nose pretty badly and yelled ""is that the best you got?!?"" Probably called them a gay slur, I don't remember. 
Cue another beatdown. Seconds later again I struggled to my feet using the nearby bench. Yelled again. They took me down again and I tried getting up before a girl from my class(who for years made fun of me), put her weight on me and told me to just stay down, that I had nothing more to prove. Her and several others who mocked and teased me for almost 3 years, told them to baxk off and refused to let them back near me. No one else helped,  but a handful of students I absolutely hated because of the way they tormented me for years, helped. 

I was pulled out 4 days later. No one messed with me but one kid who wasn't there that day. That was the only fight I had ever been in.  He jumped me from behind and I fought back. He got me 3 times in the face, I didn't feel them. I slammed my back pack off my shoulders and across his face. He went down, I jumped him. He got me in the eye and ran. 
No one else bothered me again.

Ingredients
1 teaspoon Active Dry Yeast
6 Tablespoons Warm Water
2 pinches Sugar
1-¬Ω cup Whole Wheat Flour
1-¬Ω cup White Flour
¬Ω teaspoons Salt
¬º cups Honey
¬Ω cups Water
1-¬Ω Tablespoon Fresh Thyme
4 Tablespoons Fresh Rosemary, Minced
Honey, For Drizzling Over The Top Of The Loaf
Honey And Butter, For Serving (optional)
Preparation
In a small bowl or cup combine the yeast, warm water, and sugar. Stir and then let sit until frothy on top, about 10 minutes.

In a large bowl mix the flours and salt. Add the yeast water, honey, water, thyme, and rosemary. Stir with a fork to combine until the dough starts to form a ball. Then, use your hands to knead and stir the dough until all of the loose flour becomes part of the dough.

Flour your work surface and knead the dough, adding a teaspoon or so of water if the dough tears too much when kneaded. Knead for 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough does not break or tear when pulled, but stretches.

Place the dough back in the large bowl and cover it with a slightly damp cloth. Let the dough rise for at least 1 hour in a warm place (if your oven has a ‚Äúproof‚Äù setting, use it!).

Place a piece of parchment paper on a baking sheet or stone and grease it with some butter. Take the dough (after it has risen the requisite hour), form it into a domed round, and place it on the parchment covered baking sheet. Cover it with the damp cloth and allow it to rise at least 30 minutes in a warm place again.

Preheat the oven (unless you‚Äôre using it for proofing your dough) to 350 degrees F.

After the dough has risen the second time, take a sharp knife and draw it across the top of the loaf three times in one direction and twice in the opposite direction, making a crisscross pattern: like a tic-tac-toe board with too many lines. The lines you cut should open up into little troughs. Fill these troughs with a drizzling of additional honey. The top of your dough should look like it has littleislands of dough surrounded by thin canals of honey.

Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes. Enjoy warm with a bit more honey or some butter or both!",1533081917

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I'd go for Octopath. The story is much smaller, it's about 8 individual people on their own journeys (they just hang together).  Very retro classic in a good way. Combat is fun, with the break system. I like the path-action and the job switching, and the stories are pretty good so far. It's a nice change of pace from every RPG being about saving the world.

DO NOT start with the hunter; I don't know who wrote that dialogue but it's like someone too Chaucer's middle english, passed it through a 12 year old on meth, then dropped it into a garbage bag with about 15 extra -e and -en and -eth per ounce. It's horrible and should be shot then left for the vultures.

XC2 is a great RPG, though honestly the 'tits bigger than her head' thing was off putting, especially with the 'strategic battle bikini' thing.

That aside, the combat system was kind of convoluted, with a sort of rock-paper-scissors thing on statuses that you can't really do reliably for a long time unless you already master the game.

Story was OK; nothing to write home about, just your baseline save the world RPG with by the numbers trope characters. They're all executed fairly well and aren't horribly grating.

I didn't like the emphasis on quick time events (diving, etc.) and the random 8-bit style retro arcade game you _must_ play to level up one character.

I fell off after something like 50 hours because the main character is so unerringly UPBEAT and CHEERFUL. It got a bit long. Plus the game is ridiculously long. I wasn't half way finished, I didn't grind at all, and I'd only touched a handful of side quests.",1533081921

You probably want to inform the police somehow but they themselves should not be approached obviously. She should try not to go into any place alone, if she goes out in public she should go with a friend, preferably many friends.  


What she needs to do is gather evidence of her stalking foremost. She wants to capture as much of them stalking her as possible. She has a mobile phone, she might be able to record the footage. She can also ask others capable of this to do so. Some important things to consider.  


She has to make it clear at some point she doesn't want to be followed. This establishes the intent of the person to go against her wishes and makes it stalking. If she doesn't establish this it might be argued in a court that she didn't make it very clear that she didn't want to be stalked or followed, and that they're causing distress.  


When she has this she needs to make a police statement. She should hand over any evidence that she has to them. The police may or may not approach the person who has been accused. She should ask that the police take into consideration if no arrest is made that 'the suspect might become more angered by her interfering with their behaviour'. This is because despite this being the police's job, they may not take this into account.

If you will notice, I give the same advice about 90% of the time.  Meet or exceed your protein macro, stay below your carb and fat macro, hydrate and get your electrolytes.  Seriously, I type a variation of that sentence about 8 times a day.  Do you know why I do so?  Because about 90% of the posts on our sub are made by newbies.  Seriously, I bet you dinner that 90% of the posts are made by folks who have been keto'ing less than 90 days.  And in my opinion, those folks need to be reminded that the basics are the basics for a reason.  Can some of those newbies start ""carb cycling?""  Sure.  Can some of those newbies eat more than 20 grams of net carbs a day?  Sure.  Now, which one do you start suggesting it to?  Which one do you say it is ok to have a cheat day?  Which one will continue to eat keto and which one will fall off the horse?      
   
I have no damn clue, so I give basic advice.  Can plenty of people not reach their protein macro and still retain muscle mass?  Sure.  BUT, that is not really keto 101.  That is more like keto 401.  And you know what?  By the time the keto'er gets to keto 401, she/he will not be asking a completely different question than 90% of the questions on the sub.    
      
So, I give basic advice.  I give basic advice because doing the basics well will give a sure fire path to success for a large majority of the keto'ers on this sub.  My ONLY motivation is success--yours and mine.  I don't need to sound smart.  I don't need to float theories.  I will give the basics so the largest amount of people will be successful.  ",1533081922

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was in 2nd grade and when my teacher got the message, all of the sudden we stopped what we were doing and she put on a movie. Kids started getting picked up from school and soon my mom was there to get me. 

As we got in the car my mom explained what was going on to me and told me she was having trouble getting in touch with my dad (he worked close to the trade center). She tried to get us to Staten Island (where her family is, and where she hoped my dad was trying to get to from Manhattan). By the time we got to the Outerbridge, it was closed. She got out of the car and was begging the cops to let her get to Staten Island, to which they refused. They were extremely sympathetic to her, as they saw my little sister and I in the car and calmed her down enough to turn around and go home. 

I didn‚Äôt get how tragic it all was until I saw it on the TV. It was 48 hours before my dad was able to get out of his office in the City and make it to Staten Island and get in touch with us. I think it was another three or four days until he was able to get home to NJ. 

As you can imagine, many of my classmates, friends, and neighbors were not as lucky as I was. One of the worst memories.",1533081922

A sports bra is a little clunky looking imo and doesn't give off that intentional vibe the same way that a bralette would. Since the style itself of the off-the-shoulder/one shoulder top is more feminine-reading/""delicate"", a sports bra would clash in how it reads together. ",1533081924

My original post 


&gt;No one is talking about just monocrops, 


Now which word is missing from your post that is present in my original? 

&gt;Then you are not a moral person if you cannot come up with a good argument.

Why do I need to come up with a good argument to justify myself? Am I the one arguing about my superior morality? 


&gt;So killing humans because of a personal want to do so is not a justification.

Now we need to find, what the trait is that is present in animals, that if present in humans, justifies treating animals the way we treat them. So name the trait.


Why should I? We already treat the two differently by law. 


&gt;I'm exposing biases in your belief system.


Then do a better job of picking your scenarios. Apples to oranges don't work. 


&gt;It's not me who's failing to grasp the concept here.

Lol you haven't shown your grasp the concept at all. 

&gt;Are you talking about pesticides? Then just buy organic produce. If you're referring to mice, then I would say that plants are necessary for human survival and the betterment of civilization. If a rodent poses a threat to a crop, a farmer might employ solutions such as killing the rodent. You assess the situation and see that it is an unavoidable outcome, otherwise the farmer may have a decreased yield, leading to loss of his farm, among other things such as disease spread. Unavoidable.


You do know ""organic"" doesn't mean death free right? Animals do not ignore food in nature just because its inconvenient for you. And guess what the farmer needs to do to eliminate wildlife eating his crops. Here's a hint, its not asking politely. 

See this is why I call you a hypocrite, your killing is ""justified"" because it would impact how much food you can get. But the killing of livestock is not even if it is to feed those who can't get enough plant foods. lol.


I. Never. Said. Algae. Production. Had. No. Benefits.

How dishonest can you get mate? I link the whole thing so you could look at the stated downsides. But somehow you glossed over that and decided to only link the upsides. Kinda like posting ""sources"" with only positive comements.

I didn't read it completely?

You couldn't even make it past the upsides and was tripping all over yourself to ""gotcha"" me you didn't see the potential downsides being discussed.

I'm done with your dishonesty. From your selective ""source"" posting to your omitting posts to try to make your argument seem right, to your more egregious cutting out words out of a sentence to make it seem I said something I didn't.  ",1533081924

Title: **Question about Copyright/IP/Fair Use concerning Pokemon/Nintendo - Advice appreciated**

Original Post: 

&gt; I did as much research as I could before I turned to posting here, but many of the other posts with similar questions had to do with the use and then monetization of Pokemon's characters.  However, I don't intend to create anything to sell or make some sort of profit.
&gt; 
&gt; I've designed a Pokemon-world campaign for my D&amp;amp;D group, and we've discussed perhaps bringing the game into a podcast format.  I'm not worried about using the characters in my private group, but if we do make the push to begin this podcast, I worry about the legality of it as it would be free to the public.  The names of Pokemon (and I guess the creature  themselves), abilities, and moves would be used, but that's essentially it.  There's no art being used or sold, nor is there any plans of such.  In my very humble (and likely wrong) opinion, I thought of this project more or less as a fan-fiction or a hybrid of some sort, but even then I'm not even sure about the legality of Pokemon fan fictions. 
&gt; 
&gt; Anyway, I'm not as knowledgable in the legal area of things, so I turned here.  Would a Pokemon D&amp;amp;D podcast infringe upon copyrights/intellectual property?  Or, might it fall under fair use? I'd ask Nintendo/Pokemon/Game Freak myself but there's very little faith that even if I contacted the right people that I would even get an answer. Advice is appreciated, if possible! Thank you.

This is the only reason you'd ever take a mini over an SKS for example, but that's a coin toss up between 1 shot damage or bullet speed.

On the flip side, I noticed that while the 2-3 players sitting back and covering in tree to tree combat were using M4's, the one rushing usually had an AK, where bullet damage is better than bullet speed. UMPs were used as well because of this game's ridiculous damage model for limbs.",1533081924

Title: **{PA, USA} Landlord removed fire escape from 3rd story apartment rental 6 months ago....with no replacement in sight**

Original Post: 

&gt; In February of this year, our landlord took down our fire escape from our apartment rental (building has 3 stories with 4 units in total) as it failed inspection from the city. We were given a solid heads up from the landlord that this was happening, and were assured a temporary escape path would be provided in the interim. We're approaching the six month mark of no fire escape and no temporary escape option - all communication to our landlord has either been ignored or pegged on the city's slowness to issue proper permits. 
&gt; 
&gt; As tenants, what can we do? Start withholding rent until the fire escape is installed? We want to avoid being penalized by the landlord for taking action, but also want to know that our basic safety is taken care of before it's too late.. TIA.

Since the split on that hive, I‚Äôve had to cycle out (remove ) 16 capped frames from the top super just to give them room, while still leaving the first full honey super on board. Part of it may be that I‚Äôm reusing drawn comb vs crushing. No idea..

At this point, I‚Äôm stressed because I have two other hives in the city I know are busting out, but it‚Äôs been raining so I can‚Äôt harvest to give them room.

I was thinking today that maybe in the city, there‚Äôs less of a dearth than in the country where they‚Äôre more dependent on crop cycles. Again, no idea..maybe they‚Äôre just robbing other hives. Lol

"DesignMyRoom","t5_2ux9b","I actually really like this flooring. If it‚Äôs tiles, it should be easier to clean and might avoid the common issue of having drag marks and scratches that you can get from some wood and carpet (in my experience, anyway). I can see why you‚Äôd be concerned with using a new colour you‚Äôre not used to, but the good thing is is that, with the white walls, this is quite a neutral palette to work with!

With the image of your furniture you provided, I couldn‚Äôt really see it well because of the shadows (I‚Äôm on my phone as well, which seems unreliable when someone links multiple images through imgur). However, with a floor like this, I think you could get away with quite a few pieces. The purple lounge in the house, however, was a poor choice on there part... I wouldn‚Äôt have used that without tying it in with some other purple accents.

What you could do is keep with a neutral palette for the room. With your furniture, I noticed a few red accents, which might be a bit rich for a subdued floor. This is my personal opinion, here, but I tend to thing that cooler colours, such as mint, creams, and a few shades of blue (from navy accents to powder blue accents) would work nicely with the floor and the walls. Your lounge looks grey to me in the image provided, and if so, I think it‚Äôd still work! This room has the chance to look really open, spacious and bright because of the walls and flooring. 

Browns, like a tan brown with darker wood, and that painting (blue/green one to the left of your furniture image) would look lovely, as the painting could provide the splash of colour needed to introduce some pillows of the same/similar shades.

If you want to keep the red, I‚Äôd consider it and see how it goes. The different lighting might give it a new life and save you from having to change your furniture entirely. I personally wouldn‚Äôt be concerned with the black (or maybe dark brown?) furniture you have, as a floor is merely a canvas for your furniture. It‚Äôs not a purple or blue floor, so it won‚Äôt be likely to actively clash with a colour you introduce - least of all a few black items here or there.

I don‚Äôt know if you will be painting the walls, but if you‚Äôre thinking about it, you could go for a light grey to help the transition of the black furniture. I think it would work just as fine without it, however. The black furniture might look a bit ‚Äòsharp‚Äô, but that‚Äôs what a colour palette is for, to round off some of those edges. Personal opinion coming in again: I think you‚Äôd do well with having the black/dark furniture with, rather than the blood-like red (as it appears in your image, to me), something a little calmer. I‚Äôd definitely focus around that lovely painting you‚Äôve got. It‚Äôs beautiful, a nice size, and has quite a number of pretty colours in it that can be brought out through pillows. Creams and beiges would work well with softening the black, so perhaps a different rug to the one you have? The one you have is rather unique, and I think it struggles a bit in the room with the other items, even though you‚Äôve paired it with the red pillows.

All in all, congratulations and I hope that, if you end up getting this house, you love it!",1533081931

Defense is also a superbane and that 4 point difference means a lot more units will be able to double her now

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; Obviously. It's not just about sex with another. It's about the taking of the intimacy that is agreed to belong to the two of you alone and sharing it with another.

Right, and the presumed idea behind that is that this specific intimacy can only exist with a single other person.  Hence ""emotional infidelity"".

But really, what causes infidelity?  Primarily it's mismatched expectations resulting in unmet needs.  This is one of the reasons when the 65% - 70% that stay married AFTER infidelity occur half report more intimate and stronger relationships.  This is because either with or without counseling they identify the causes and adjust the relationship.  

In most cases couples can realistically adjust, but the reality is that you just can't fake a sex drive or interest in needs of your partner.  This is the primary case where a third person or just the option to satiate whatever needs emotional/physical outside the relationship, making it open, become valuable.  As long as both people are fully informed and comfortable about it this saves relationships between loving people with mismatched wavelengths in some form or another.  Though it is harder of course, more communication than ever is needed.  ",1533081934

Web dev is definitely something that I'd try to go into, but it probably wouldn't be a priority. I already had an interest in HTML, but I think I should try Python first, see how things go and then check out HTML, CSS and Javascript.

&gt;Cool thing you can do to learn CSS is to make a private subreddit and edit the stylesheet. It's all CSS based.

Good to know! I'm definitely going to try that someday.

&gt;Because otherwise why not just read the source, ya know?

I totally agree with you, but sometimes people just prefer one media over the other. I have a friend who doesn't have the patience to read manga, and she just watches anime. She's missing a lot of good stuff, I know.

&gt;Woah, I'm a bit jealous to be honest. Hope it all works out, that sounds like a dream.

Thanks a lot! And I'd love if you visited some time. If you get the chance to go there, know that you definitely have a place to stay.

Dude, that's so sad :/ It's a bit similar with my story with my dad, but not only my mom, but my sister and I as well have been psychologically affected by him and his attitudes. But my dad is not that old and he has some family and a few friends left so he's quite okay staying here. 

&gt;I can't see it getting any better.

Even so, I really hope something happens and things change for the better.",1533081936

"livesound","t5_2remi","I think sadly I will me the realistic one and say you don't have much chance of being in a job \*doing\* live sound where you can just sit at a console and mix. The majority of people 'come through the system' and do some of the more physical jobs first (which is not just tradition, it's also important). You'll also have to do physical work on the gigs, usually. There's not many gigs happening where the FOH engineer is allowed to white glove it to the point of leaving the gig after the encore and letting somebody else pack up.

BUT, the field of live sound is so much bigger than mixing bands and setting up speakers. Could you find enjoyment in tech support, service / maintenance, or sales? All these roles are very connected to live sound itself, and vital to the gigs happening. A lot of people who originally think they're destined for mixing bands, do these jobs when they realise their skills are better placed.

A sales or support position at a major manufacturer or distributor would still need in-depth knowledge of the product (which you could be trained on) and frequent experience in using it. But would be much more desk-based and better for your health. Maintenance would be a bit more physical but probably within your reach, doing short spells of physical work to get access to the thing you're working on, then less physical workshop work on the components.

I think there's roles within live sound for you, just probably not touring mixing ones.",1533081936

"news","t5_2qh3l","I'm a chemistry major. Different from a pharmacologist, granted, but I don't need the pedantic reductive explanations of chemistry. Condensed molecular structures mean just about nothing. The shape of the molecule, it's functional groups and it's substituents matter most. The amphetamine group is a particular type of amine. An amine is a nitrogen connected to the carbon base somehow. All amphetamines share this characteristic. I'm not quite able to make out exactly what characteristics of the amine group make it a suitable amphetamine, but it appears that the functional group is primary in all cases. In Vyvanse, the amide is considered functional, but the amine(s) - one of which seems to be sterically hindered by an alcohol nearby- appears also to be primary. All three have exceedingly similar characteristics. They are in the same class of drugs because of this. 

The parent chains (rings) of all of the chemicals have different characteristics, but that does not necessarily change their type of reactivity significantly. It may rule out some reactions, or it may simply slow them down. Vyvanse has a long carbon chain in separating the suspect amine from the sterically awkward molecule. I would think this allows the amine more freedom to react, but it does not fundamentally change the way that amine will react. 

Yes, bond and structure make the difference between poisonous, and benign, but also regiochemistry plays a major role, such as that one regiochemical version of naproxen is toxic and another is not.

Better off shorter, with three telescoping legs so no balancing is required. Effectively a stool. Make each telescoping leg a separate piece. Make the detachable seat cushion double as a ground seat if desired. Allow modular choices: option to clip on a backing to the unit if desired (the backing doubles as a table top), option to use telescoping legs to assemble the table instead of a chair, etc. If these were sturdy enough, a tripod/monopod attachment would serve an additional purpose. That'd make this cool.

My guy is going to be 18 months soon and I've found the hardest thing is they seem so much smarter and they can understand some things thanks to repetition, but they simply don't have the experience to truly understand us yet and as an adult that is very trying to our patience.

I started listening to a book called How to Talk so Little Kids Will Listen. Basically starting around 2, we have to begin giving our children the vocabulary to express their feelings. ""Oh, it is SO frustrating when you have to stop playing to have your diaper changed!"" ""It makes you SO sad when you can't play with the dog because he is asleep."" ""You feel angry when mommy tells you to stop banging on the walls!"" 

As they get older you start giving them tools to express their emotions safely. As they get even older you can help them talk out why some things make them feel such and such way. 

It's tough when first starting out working on the communication skills as young as 2, but as the book says, even if it doesn't work the first few times, or if you get it wrong, you will get a lot of practice and repetition is the key to learning at this young age!",1533081938

There's no such thing as a ""Just Business"" marriage in the eyes of the law - marriage is a specific legal status with specific legal consequences.   You would be subject to whatever responsibilities WI has towards spouses.

However, if you're with a colleague or at an interview, it's more political: focus on the tips like complimenting them, making them happy to do favors for you, etc..  With girls, it's a bit different, though still somewhat applicable.  Set your boundaries more and be more assertive with what you want.  Be fine with disagreeing and sticking up for yourself.

For the midfield, Kante and Jorginho are indisputable. However, we either bring in an elite 3rd midfielder or let Barkley have a shot. Sarri did say he was lacking quality there however this was before Barkley had a chance to impress.

For our LB, we could sign a top LB or let Emerson or Alonso have a go.

For CB, Rudiger is an undisputed starter and I think so is David Luiz now. Christensen to rotate. But Rudiger-David Luiz seems amazing to me, as they can both play out the back smoothly.

For RB, no discussion, definitely Azpi with Zappacosta backup.

GK is undisputed Courtois, and I‚Äôm not too worried as we are only selling if we secure a repoacement, which I‚Äôll doubt we‚Äôll do as there are none currently.


TL;DR: We are not desperate for any signings, no position really needs a big upgrade, but if we are looking to go to the next level, we should sign an elite midfielder and LB. We need to sign a GK if Courtois leaves but no worries as we‚Äôll only sell if we sign one and there aren‚Äôt any on the market.",1533081941

I think Trump at least was getting reports of what was going on. Trump Jr. knew he was setting up a meeting with a Russian agent about dirt on Clinton, and there's not a chance he didn't tell Daddy Trump. 

Trump's been trying to get in on the Russian scene since the 80s, so I don't think it's necessarily kompromat that's driving him, but it could be. I think the scenario of #3 - that both men just happened to share similar goals - explains a lot of the early work, but once Trump started accepting help, he couldn't turn back.

I hope you'll take the time to read through it and feel free to talk to me about it more if you have questions - beth@bethfukumoto.com

But, the bottom line is this ... I started speaking out against Donald Trump in 2015. But, I was a voice of resistance in the Republican Party long before that. I did what I could to hold the line against intolerance from within because I believe someone needed to. Eventually, I realized it was a lost cause, and it did a disservice to my own beliefs and the Republican Party for me to keep trying to make it something that it wasn't. I was a Democrat. I was just an anti-establishment Democrat, and I didn't see any of those in Hawaii when I first got involved. But, even as a Republican, I was one of the leading voices in the House on issues of income inequality, and we actually moved a lot of progressive taxation policies out of the House.

When I started speaking out against Donald Trump, it came at a risk. I was actually being courted by Paul Ryan's chief of staff and others in the RNC as the next HI-01 candidate. It would've come with a lot of money and a lot of support. But, it wasn't who I was, and I knew I couldn't go down that road. So, I walked away from it, I spoke out against Trump at the Women's March and I left the Republican Party knowing that there was no guarantee I'd be accepted as a Democrat. If I had been turned down by the party committee (and for awhile it looked like I would be), I would not have been allowed to run as a Democrat in this election or any other. It was a big risk, but again, I knew it was what I had to do.

The level of scrutiny that I came under publicly and in Democratic Party meetings was unprecedented, but it was a good way for me to prove that I meant what I said. That's part of why I do so many AMAs in person and online ... we should test politicians.",1533081944

"steinsgate","t5_2t8ve","In a way that makes sense in the target language (Spanish in this case), taking liberties where it must to achieve this ""sense"", but not so liberal that it twists the original author's intent.

Let's say I wrote a visual novel in English, and one of my characters said the phrase ""What's wrong? Cat got your tongue?""

""Cat got your tongue?"" is an expression that Person A might ask Person B if Person B is having a hard time speaking to Person A about something. This phrase is commonly used in English.

When translating this phrase to the target language however, one should not literally translate the phrase as it is, or the reader of the translated work would interpret it as Person A literally saying ""Does a cat have your tongue?""

In this case, one may instead translate the phrase ""Why are you so quiet?"" instead, to avoid confusion. This is just one example, but there are many other reasons why one should not literally translate text, for greater reader understanding.

This is why machine translations of visual novels are such a great problem: machines are not humans, for the most part they *cannot* understand the deeper intent of the author's choice of words/phrasing. Additionally, a machine translation may not be able to properly adjust the original sentence's grammar/word choice to fit the target language.

- The elastics were the most annoying thing for me. The bracket eventually dug into my cheek really bad and then the elastic started catching on the broken skin making it worse. Every time I opened my mouth, more skin would be pulled off. I waited too long to use wax, I highly recommend getting some. CVS has thicker stuff that stuck much better than my ortho gave me.

This will help the booming cargo village and allow for more smooth traffic inbound and outbound. The taxiways will be slightly wider as well, allowing for larger aircraft to taxi with more wiggle room.

Runway 11/29 is planned to be 61 meters (200 feet) wide and 3,530 meters (11,580 feet) long. Its preliminary engineering is essentially complete and construction is expected to begin after the twinning of highway 19 is completed, as all of the land needed has now been acquired by the province. It will allow for Edmonton to have the capacity its needs in a few years, especially when it has to shut down one runway for reworking/repair/repaving, etc, by not causing crazy overcongestion on a single runway. 

It also allows for further airside growth to occur, as a large amount of the cargo village and north &amp; south airport commercial lots have been now purchased, leased, acquired or are under a memorandum of understanding with a potentially future occupant.

Energy:

Pokemon:

4 Gible/2 Gabite/3 Garchomp

3 Riolu/2 Lucario

1 Tapu Lele-GX

1 Drampa-GX (Big Wheel is a single normal energy GX attack that does no damage but lets you shuffle and draw 10. I'm using PFC or Apricorn on turn one or two to get Drampa, attach and use Big Wheel to help me get cards to fill up my bench and also make Hala a true Sycamore replacement)



Trainers - Items:

4 Ultra Ball

4 Nest Ball

1 Timer Ball (in case I don't have the cards in hand to use Ultra Ball off of Apricorn to get a Lucario or Garchomp on turn two)

3 Choice Band

2 Rare Candy

1 Energy Retrieval

1 Field Blower

1 Escape Rope

1 Pal Pad (it was going to be Lusamine, but then I saw your list and realized that Pal Pad is better because of Lucario's Precognitive Aura and saves the Supporter for the turn)



Trainers - Supporters:

4 Cynthia

2 Hala (useful if I can use Big Wheel early)

2 Apricorn Maker (I'll use one on first turn from Tapu Lele's Wonder Tag)

2 Guzma

2 Lillie

1 Pokemon Fan Club

1 Acerola (can be used to place Lele again for another Supporter if you're having a slow start)

yes taking 2 camps pre 6 is huge, but what i am trying to say is when jungler gets beyond lv 6 &amp; have ult, this effect diminishes a lot. fighting a 2v1 or 3v2 fight as a lv 6 jungler while enemy jungler is not around doesn't make a difference even if u are 1 level ahead. i still impact the game by ganking. 

first, it's hard to have so much time to counter 2 camps in first 7 min of the game, unless enemy jungler leave camps untouched &amp; overganking pre 6. before jg changes in 8.10, i played warwick jg &amp; did 3 return ganks to top in lv 3 &amp; 4, &amp; just snowballed my top to become 3/0. that lead is so big that u can't match that lead by just taking my 2 camps. i am not saying it should have same effectiveness by taking 2 camps to match a 3 kill scenario, but ganking just provide so much of a lead.

&amp; what i m focus to say is that when u counter jungle 1 or 2 camps at lv 8, it basically doesn't matter. i can get exp back with rubber bending, &amp; more importantly ganking helps my team much more. when jungler find out a camp is stolen at lv 8+, his thought is ""a camp is stolen, he is in top side"", but he doesn't feel that's much of a loss to him. 

at the beginning of my post i said: there is an item called poacher's dirk, so this means riot try to give extra incentive to counter jungling. but the poacher's dirk approach is not correct because no one picks it. so how about making a tweat on counter jungling so that everyone can benefit from it. &amp; i think counter jungling is a bad strategy to win because it's much weaker than gank focus approach. i would not win games by countering 4 camps, but i can win games by making my top / bot 2/0.

i know the answer of counter jungling strategy being bad, but i am asking should we or how to find a way to make counter jungling strategy execute better.",1533081950

I would propose that most men have the privilege of choice in the matter.  If you are a SAHM, with no marketable skills, several young children in need of childcare, literally no adult friends or community outside of the church, and leaving the church could literally cost you everything...it seems like immense pressure to keep drinking the koolaid.  There is often no other identity for a woman in the church, especially if they are not employed.  Much like TBMs that take questions about their faith as a personal attacks, I would imagine many of these women also have their identities wrapped up in the church and the gospel.

I agree with you and OP that some Mormon wives are quite toxic.  I just think it is worth exploring where that toxicity comes from, to better understand how to combat and prevent it.

I'm not doing that. I addressed the issue head on: the ""influencing"" has gone on for a while and existing ""influencing"" created both Putin and Trump. That people are now fighting over it indicates that globalism, a concept that is just countries influencing each other without barriers, is ending as people become intolerant of any influence.

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","Depends on how good the grades are and what else they have in their resume. Almost all the Top-20 universities here are very generous with aid as they're all private and have a huge pool of financial resources. The same applies to the top liberal arts colleges such as Williams and Amherst. 

If the kid can get into that college, then no, they wouldn't really have to worry that much, though admissions to these colleges care a lot more about stuff outside of academics since a majority of the applicants were top of their class. 

Otherwise it really depends on the state. Florida and Georgia both have great flagship universities in the Top-50 with UF and Georgia Tech, and they both created a scholarship program funded by their state lottery to cover full tuition at public universities as long as they meet a certain academic thresh hold. The requirement is much higher in Florida than in Georgia, though.

California has the Blue-Gold Plan which covers your tuition if your family makes less than a certain amount so long as you're an in-state resident, and I believe Michigan, Virginia, and Wisconsin have similar programs. Last I heard, the UM and UW flagships were covering tuition of students whose families made somewhere less than 55k, though that number probably changed. 

If you have great grades it's really hard to not be able to afford college, in my opinion. In my experience, with public universities, the main flagship doesn't tend to give out as much aid though lesser known universities will offer lots of merit scholarships to try and attract students who would otherwise choose a higher ranked school. Some of those schools are still fine institutions despite being not as nationally renowned. 

There's also the option of community college. My local newspaper always publishes where the top students of each class go for college each year, and the 3 main high schools here with the strong magnet or AP programs tend to have more privileged students so you see a ton of people going to Top-20 schools or UF, but the valedictorians of the other schools usually go to local community colleges or a lesser known school in Florida presumably because of finances. 

However, people from other parts of the US might not be as lucky. It really comes down to the state.

A picture of Odeh standing alone in front of a tank, with a stone in his hand and arm bent back to throw it, was taken by a photojournalist from the Associated Press on 29 October 2000. Ten days later, on 8 November, Odeh was again throwing stones at Karni when he was shot in the neck by Israeli troops. The boy and the image subsequently assumed iconic status within the Palestinian territories as a symbol of opposition to the area's occupation by Israel.

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","Okay so there's probably a couple hundred ways of approaching this question. First thing you want to ask yourself is why do you want to join the Marine Corps? I can assure you, it is NOT what you think it is. Let me be clear first, I wouldn't trade my service for anything. I learned a whole lot about myself, other people, and how the world works, even from my small part in seeing it's day to day operation. It's difficult, but not impossible. I will also tell you the Marine Corps has a very very big problem keeping Marines IN the Marine Corps, and for very good reason. Don't quote me on it, but I believe the figure is something like only 1 in 10 Marines re-enlists after their first 4 years. Out of everyone I knew, I can think of two people who re-enlisted. All my friends got out. The Marine Corps is... basically, it's daycare for adults. If you don't mind being treated like a child for four years, then go for it. There's a good amount of pride all Marines have. It gave me a very solid base of confidence and I matured quite a bit from the experience. I also met a lot of good people who would do anything for me and vice versa. But I also dealt with a lot of bullshit in the four years. 

My suggestion would be to join another branch of the military as an MP. Then, you can get out and go to school for FREE! If Law Enforcement is your gig, just know you run the risk of not getting that MOS if you go into the Marine Corps. I was supposed to be one MOS and they made me another, they did that to my entire platoon. All the cool shit I did in the Marine Corps can definitely be found in any other branches. You just won't deal with half of the bullshit and have a much better quality of life. 

What it all boils down to is, the title of United States Marine. Is that important to you? Do you want it that bad? Do you want to carry that pride with you? If so, then start running and doing some pull-ups. If serving your country is your motivator, I'd join another branch. 

If I could go back and do it all over again, I would have joined the Air Force or Coast Guard as an EASY MOS. I would have saved myself a lot of money, time, trouble, two knees, and a back. I would have gotten out in great shape physically and financially, and I would have went to school for free. 

Don't buy the recruiters bullshit. They're gonna spew shit about earning the title and being the best and all that. I ate into it, just like everyone else did. Not all Marines are badass. Not all Marines are hardcore. Not all Marines are door kicking, America loving, barrel chested freedom fighters. A lot of Marines are really really shit people and they deserve nothing but horrible things to come to them. Case in point, a Sergeant in my platoon was a wife beater. Everyone looked up to him and respected him, even I did. Then we all found out what he was doing and some of us split, and some of us stayed. Those that stayed on his side don't hear from us, the one's who didn't. The uniform does not make the make the man/woman. The man/woman makes the uniform. ",1533081956

I dated a really unhealthy INFP though (though to be fair to him I had some really unhealthy traits to work through myself. Still not 100% sure I've beaten them since I haven't dated since him, thus, I haven't tested out my growth to the fullest extent.) But passivity and avoiding conflict I've seen displayed in my healthy INFP friends too. Other things with my ex that hurt could be contributed to any unhealthy personality of any type, or just unhealthy INFPs and not every single INFP out there. 

Despite these bad experiences the vast majority of INFPs I've met are really thought provoking, creatively stimulating, and a lot of relaxed fun to be around. I know some people have said some of the INFPs are closed minded or SJWs in some ways. And while I suppose my ex had that to an extent, it wasn't too bad until he started treating me like an enemy. But that was just the notion that my existence offended him after awhile (I didn't know right away since he avoided me) and less about close-mindedness in general.

Maybe. It would really depend on what sort of explanation they came up with for *why* he fell. While this wouldn't have to require tons of exposition (e. g. stumbled onto a Sith holocron in ruins colocated with Luke's praxeum), but it *could* take, you know, three whole movies to explain (cf. the prequels).

You'd also need to explain why/how the First Order came to take in Kylo, which strikes me as more complicated. Even if you leave the details of this to the novels, I don't think you could make Kylo the sort of emotionally unstable weirdo that he is in the ST. There'd need to be more going on upstairs than hormones and childhood resentment, and there would need to be more to his relationship with Hux that mutual loathing.

My PS3 still sees about as much use as my PS4 on average. 

At the same time, Sony presumably stopped making DS3 controllers as soon as they stopped making PS3 consoles, over a year ago.  controllers break and wear out, and need to be replaced, so the stock dried up quick. but unlike Xbox 360 controllers, DS3 controllers are still in demand, so there is a market for counterfeits.

Well, no, those are entirely separate ideas. One doesn't logically follow the other. I do believe the principle that 'every little bit helps' which is why I collect all my change, but I'm not advocating adding anything to our monetary supply. It's not worth the systemic cost to our government. If such a coin existed in circulation (and actually there have been smaller denominatins of currency produced at various times in the past) then the same principle would apply that it does indeed add up.

You're choosing a particular denomination of currency based on, I'm not sure what exactly, and saying it is ""effectively worthless"" without any justification. You haven't presented anything logical at all. At some theoretical future date, maybe single dollar bills will be effectively worthless too, but who determines what is ""effectively worthless""? If the super rich were to decide, maybe anything less than $100 would be effectively worthless. It's a question of how much you value your own effort. Thus, choosing beggars.",1533081957

The reason I make such a nitpick is I think just as there are many people pointing to the statistic and claiming 'discrimination' there are also many people claiming the statistic is a 'myth.'

They wouldn't, the key thing is 'knowingly'. Take a look at hijackings  of passenger planes from 1990 to 2000: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_hijackings#1990s

I think, especially now, it's easy to forget that hijackings were fairly common. So the presumption was ""hang tight and you'll be fine"". In the same vein as how if there's a bank robbery, people are instructed to just go along with it because most times they aren't going to kill anyone, they're just after money.

there are 2 large percentage of origin in malay DNA, 1 from taiwan and another large DNA are from Javanese island. Why only focus on one group of people while those DNA from java island are purely doesnt have any relation with taiwan's haplogroup mitochondria (or what so ever). 

the 1st research paper shows that kelantanese has the older haplogroup similar to the semang orang asli.

"radio","t5_2qht3","Okay, now to all the stuff you *didn't* ask:

One purpose for those microwave antennas on Art Bell's tower could be for studio-transmitter links. In a great many situations, the programming is produced far from where the broadcast is transmitted. Say, in an office building in the valley, versus a windswept ridge several miles from town. You just have to get the audio from one to the other (and monitor/control the broadcast transmitter) via some sort of path. This could be a telephone line, or it could be a radio link. Guess which one radio engineers are more comfortable with!  

In many situations, a legacy station with a small studio at the transmitter site, will be converted to remote operation, with a newer and nicer studio in a more hospitable location. But suppose some nasty fate were to befall that studio! There are lots of moving parts to get the whole thing online again, and of course, all the old equipment still exists at the transmitter site. Many stations still maintain the old studio exactly for emergency use. Others, where there never was a true studio at the site, have the bare bones of a microphone and tape deck somewhere in the transmitter equipment room, as a when-all-else-fails route for the engineer to get on the air and make emergency announcements. (And likely a shelf of canned food and long-since-expired medical supplies, because radio people especially used to take this stuff seriously, until some corporate types realized they were playing moneyball.) 

If the station were operated like that, the protagonist could drive to the transmitter site, fix whatever's wrong on the tower, throw the remote/local switch, and Bob's your uncle. (But he hates being called Bob. Please. It's Jack.) 

That being said, if something was shorting the transmitter's output, there's a good chance the final amplifier stage would be damaged, too. Hope the baddies meddled with the tower after power had already failed, perhaps? Because even assuming there's a spare on site (there sure should be!), swapping a tube of that size is no mean feat -- the larger ones can be [water-cooled](http://j-hawkins.com/wlw.shtml), and the transmitter might need to be re-tuned after such a swap. Maybe a lower power station might use more normal components, and untuned operation could just mean reduced power or a dirty signal or something. 

Power-wise, a blackout is unlikely to be strictly statewide. Transmission and distribution networks tend to follow geographical rather than political boundaries, and the massive [generation capacity of the Hoover Dam is only fractionally consumed in Nevada](https://www.usbr.gov/lc/hooverdam/faqs/powerfaq.html) -- about 24% in Nevada, 19% in Arizona, and all the rest goes to California. So an outage that dulls the Vegas Strip's sparkle also finds large parts of the west coast plunged into darkness. And hydroelectric plants are some of the hardest to kill and easiest to restart -- unlike a nuke that needs feedwater pumps running before it can start up, or a coal that needs pulverizers and stuff, [water in a penstock is just ready to go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_start). Large generators need an excitation source, but that can be a truly minuscule standalone generator to get things going again. It's possible to have grid instability that would make the generators trip off to protect themselves, but the folks in the control room aren't just going to take that lying down. (And the southwest has never seen that happen -- the [northeast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_1965) knows a [bit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) about it, though.) 

Generator-wise, it might be interesting to understand that the electrical power consumed by an AM station is related to the audio content of the programming -- when there's no sound in front of the mic, there's (almost) no power coming out the transmitter. And depending on the [amplifier's circuitry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_amplifier_classes), it may also mean almost no power being drawn by the transmitter. Which may really play havoc with a generator -- any AM broadcast engineers wanna shed some light on this? 

Contrast FM, where the carrier is transmitted at full power all the time, and the frequency wibbles around to encode the audio. This places a constant load on the generator or power grid, and means the heat generated in the finals doesn't vary with the programming, either. 

Tower-wise, it's also common for broadcast towers to have cellular and other equipment on 'em. Many municipalities won't issue a permit for construction of a new tower if an existing one can meet the need. It's a PITA to put cellular (or anything else, really) onto an AM tower, since the whole tower is active and part of the antenna, but FM sites will often have a whole porcupine of equipment up there. Because cells want to limit their radius (to provide [geographic frequency reuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_network#Frequency_reuse)), they use carefully chosen antenna height and [downtilt](http://www.proxim.com/products/knowledge-center/calculations/calculations-downtilt-coverage-radius). This leads to an amusing appearance, where a beanstalk-tall broadcast tower will have a [tutu](https://www.kintronic.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/100_0993.jpg) of [cellular crap](https://forums.wirelessadvisor.com/gallery/i-55.372/) just a fraction of the way up. Not to mention a plethora of other stuff like legacy pager antennas, police/fire radio dispatch antennas, etc. ",1533081964

Lead/Friend Lead: Ochako x2 (30% BB Reduc. each)

Execution: Allanon (executes UBB)

Recast: Natalame (100% recast and OD fill rate SP)

Extra Action: Ravea (for BBs 100% extra action)

Unit 1: Galtier (10% instant OD fill SBB)

Unit 2: Xenon (10% instant OD fill SBB)


(Also dont have ezra so I replaced both leads with Ochaco).

So my questions: 

Am I missing anything else besides the spheres?

LS will give a total of 60% BB reduc. to every unit, so which units need exactly the 100% BB reduc? (i.e. do all units need to have 0 BC cost?)

People that say aspartame is horrible for you are lying to you. It‚Äôs one of the most researched chemicals of all time and has been proven safe over and over. To become toxic or harmful you‚Äôd have to consume a ridiculous amount of it every day (30+ sodas).

Regular soda is not really unhealthy either, it just has a lot of calories and sugar. You can have sugar in moderation and still be healthy. 

If your goal is to lose weight, diet soda is a great way to have soda without affecting what you can or can‚Äôt eat that day. Three regular sodas have the caloric value of a decent sized lunch, with none of the satiation of eating. Is it easier to eat 1500 calories and have three Cokes or 2000 calories and three Coke Zeroes?

Sometimes a choice in partner holds you back.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","[Here's a twitter thread with a bunch of plays from Manning at Tennessee.](https://twitter.com/NFLFilmStudy/status/1008449209807319042)

[Watch this play and say Manning is a bad athlete.](https://twitter.com/NFLFilmStudy/status/1009641383970398209)

[Here's the only scouting report that comes up.](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2050587-looking-back-at-nfl-draft-profiles-from-back-in-the-day#slide1)

&gt;He is a fierce competitor, and all of his mechanics are very solid. He has good arm strength, but not necessarily a ‚Äúgun‚Äù that you might expect from a QB at the top of the draft.. He has adequate mobility and good overall AA, although he is not a scrambler by nature. 

Here's an excerpt from Bill Polian's book: 

&gt;In late March/early April, we arranged a private workout with Peyton at Tennessee. Tom has an arm-strength drill whereby he stands the quarterback on the goal line and has a receiver facing him five yards away. The quarterback has to throw to the receiver using only his arm; he isn't allowed to step into his throw or use his feet in any way. And after each throw, the receiver moves back in 5-yard increments until he eventually reaches the 50-yard line.

&gt;By the time the receiver gets to the 50, you have a pretty good idea of whether the quarterback has a strong arm or not because he isn't putting anything else physically into his throws -- and he already has thrown nine passes that way.

&gt;Tom put Peyton through the arm-strength drill, and his pass to the 50-yard line was on a rope. Peyton's arm was among the strongest I have seen. It maybe was not quite as strong as Jim Kelly's, but certainly strong enough. Interestingly, Peyton threw what we call a ""heavy ball,"" meaning it has a lot of rotation on it, which was quite interesting because guys with weaker arms usually don't throw a heavy ball. When you catch a heavy ball, your hands sting because it comes out with some heat on it.

"wow","t5_2qio8","I'll say what I commented elsewhere:

&gt; The evil brutality on display here is particularly unnecessary. Sylvanas could have had her plan to be destroying the tree all along, but allowed the civilians to evacuate before burning it down. She could logically see it as a place the Alliance could stage the collection and eventual shipment of azerite, wanting to remove it from the board as a strategic plan to protect the Horde and its interests in Kalimdor. It gives her a position as a cold and practical leader, being willing to destroy the night elf home, without the pure evil of burning innocent people alive. THAT would be an honorable victory that would let horde players be proud of their faction and of Sylvanas' capable leadership, while still giving more than enough of a reason for the Alliance to retaliate and take the Undercity.

&gt; There, was that so hard? Are Blizzard's writers so inept, or so bias against the Horde, that they had to just add in the burning of innocent civilians? Are they that intent on creating a Garrosh 2.0? Because that is what they've done. After something like this Sylvanas can NEVER have a believable redemption. Nor would the other leaders of the horde and their respective races ever continue to follow her after such a heartless act.

This wasn't morally grey. It was unnecessarily evil from the get go. Explicitly setting out to break their spirits and destroy their hope is evil already, the brutal mass murder of civilians was just extra on the evil cake. ",1533081970

The reason it's crazily and shittily written is because  Smash bros (and other) characters have no business being in awakening.

"MoneroMining","t5_3g0a8","TL;DR -- unless AMD opensources a set of PAL (and not HSA/ROCm) opencl glue, you *really* want PCIE Gen3/Atomic bridges. 99.9% of the gear you see on ali/ebay/amz is not that.

Serious answer: if you're going for non-vega ati gpus, pretty much all the pci bridges you find on ali and whatnot are pcie 1.0 or 2.0 bridges at best, and basically none of em are new enough silicon for pcie gen3+atomics, which means that unless amd suddenly starts releasing new PAL drivers or clover or someone catches up with a good opencl library or gets the amd one to work on a non-HSA setup, you're gonna have a real pain in the ass getting anything to work.

Apparently its something amds looked into fixing but on their newest stacks have only released stuff for the Vega GPUs.  They say its about 'testing firmware', and that sounds about right actually for the way the HSA stack works. Most of its actually 'arbitrated' card-side in that design -- which is great in theory for miners, but the way they did it makes solutions like this not work for most older cards (except maybe hawaii's).

Unless they release an alternate firmware. I have some rigs I've slapped together a rough ubuntu 18 + amdgpu 17.40 (last amdgpu-pro revision packing a non-HSA openCL that doesnt have compile errors on cryptonight) and have some ansible stuff to help me manage it.  The fact that those work I think shows that its not necessarily a hardware limitation, its just that most of AMDs customer base is more in the server/HPC world where your chipset variance and the like is rather lower, and there's certain assumptions for data transfer that make their world 100x better if you can code for that sort of cross-communication.

If someone ported amd's opencl 1.2/2.0 oss libraries to the clover state tracker and made the amd intrinsics optional/ported that would actually be great for compute, and not just for miners.  I also do a lot with darktable and having a setup where I could actually throw 2 or 3 (random) gpus at its opencl workflow would be amazeballs.  Theres a ton of potential too in some of the GPGPU stuff if that host/tracker layer can get more generic imo.  See for example AMD's exploratory work in letting GPU tasks transparently call host linux syscalls (https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCK_syscall / https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06965)

If you're mining on pretty much any other gpu, or you're sticking to windows rigs, disregard.",1533081975

it has a poisn effect, which if something dies while posioned, it spread to all mobs nearby

it has a sword, as one of the final powers.. which kinda sucks as its not a all the time use, but a cool down power, that will do X attacks before it runs out

also having a group of 4, running 2 or 3 different classes, is great. 

get a guardian up front with its shield, combat medic behind to heal and boost every one, assassin and assault to also give out the area boosts.. which stack... combat medic is kinda OP tho.. 4 player group with combat medics.. and the boost skill to yours and nearby allies damage output by like 50%, which stacks... get a 200% damage boost for 15 seconds... its glorious. then also 2 players with revive spike, and 2 with ego spike.. team will never die

the hot shots / rampages 

it doesnt tell you the gun, but as theres only like 20-30 of them, you learn what they are pretty quick, as at resivor chickens is always a single shot pistol. some of the names help as well, ie bolanis sharpshooter, is that gonna be a shotty or a sniper round? rocket dam defence? lmg or rockets? the rampages also say 'mini gun mayhem' or 'rocket party' (or somthing like that)

they still have loads of content from D13 to add back in.. and hae said they are working on more classes, and even alternative raid bosses, new end game content ect. 

-------

monetization, is actually really good.. 75% of the items are cosmetic outfits, or skins for cars, theres then a bunch of inventory and loud out slots you can buy, but only up to 200 i think.. theres some boosts, and a few boxes to buy random things.. 

they even premtivly stopped a P2W route, you could buy cores with money, use cores to make new prototypes, buy salvge from store, use salvage to enhance gun to higher level, increasing your level.. buy more cores ect. but they realsied before release that this could happen, so no any prototype you re-make, will be 250 below your power, so even fully enhanced, will only equal you.

"TrueChronicIllness","t5_hkmgr","You need to go to a pulmonologist.  They can perform the test for asthma (meth-something challenge, sorry, I can't recall it off the top of my head).  But asthma can worsen and improve throughout your life.  Typically, people say they ""grew out of their asthma"" and think it is gone because it usually calms down significantly as you age into adulthood.

However, some of us, myself included, have asthma that still needs to be monitored and controlled even as an adult.  I am 23 and have had it since I was a baby (though you get formally diagnosed as a toddler).  The biggest thing a pulmonologist will ask to read as an indication of whether or not your asthma is controlled is the coughing, especially at nighttime.   It sounds like you are coughing at night enough to wake you up, which is a sign of it being badly controlled right now.

There are many different types of medications they can get you on to help control it long term, and they will also provide you with rescue inhalers and albuterol/nebulizer treatments if it is, in fact, asthma.  Ideally, you want to get the the point where the control medication you are on is an inhaled corticosteroid and does not contain fermoderol (spelling may be off, sorry), which can cause albuterol and rescue medication for asthma to be ineffective in the event of an asthma attack.  Obviously, you can understand why that is bad.  However, those types of control medications are stronger than inhaled corticosteroids and it sounds like you may be put on one of those for a month or so to stabilize the asthma and then they should try swapping you over to a corticosteroid control medication plus rescue inhaler as needed.

But you definitely need to be seen by pulmonology, and let them know the extent of your breathing struggles and that you need to be seen ASAP.  It isn't something you just want to let get out of hand like this.",1533081977

Naturally unemphatic- I can basically just switch off feelings when I want to, but typically I don‚Äôt. Feelings are what makes you human, after all.

"CreativeDestruction","t5_kvbt5","Some tips from me:

* Don't always spam the ""Bastion"" buttion (or the quick fort thing). Its so easily broken and gives snipers who are watching you more of an opporunity. You don't know how many games i've played where the guy i'm shooting is SUPER low, but I get sniped by someone else looking at me when i spammed the bastion button.

* Use long range guns for long range, or get closer. Don't camp in this game. Engage in as much CQC as possible or use a sniper. There are snipers everywhere (very inexperienced ones also). Using a SCAR is **very** effective. 

* Avoid the DTR (unless its purple.). I thought this gun was good because when I started playing I didn't realise that I was playing with loads of bots, and I was easily able to get up to them and kill them, but its actually really bad unless its purple. It does 14 damage and that doesn't help when being lasered by an UZI.

* ALWAYS USE XM8. That thing is overpowered and sounds almost silent when shooting it. Same for the VSS (Never found a VSS before)

* Don't use spammables for long ranges. The UMP and UZI are very good, but spamming them from long ranges often does little damage and the other person will take you out with a scar or an AK. 

* Keep your inventory organized. This helps you to reach the guns you want quickly and efficiently.

* (USE THIS IF YOU WANT TO) This is usually the kind of stuff I keep in my inventory:
   * AR (Scar or AK)
   * SMG (UZI or UMP)
   * Scoped AR (XM8)
   * Sniper (PSG-1 or AWM/S idk what its called)
   * Healable (bandage or medkit)
   * Shield 

If needed, replace the SMG for a shotgun.

I almost always see some kind of wildlife.  In order of frequency:

- Northern Pygmy Owl - Many on every ride.  They sit on the ground, and I can see their eyes reflect in my headlamp beam.

- Bat - Many on every ride, scooping insects from my beam.  Occasionally they swoop so close to my face I can see their eyes.

- Kangaroo Rat - Will dart from edge of road to get insects in my beam.
- Mule Deer - They're everywhere

- Coyote - Also everywhere

- Grey Fox - These are curious, and will shadow me for some distance.  I've had several 'close encounters' where they will sit within 1m and listen to me talk to them.

- Skunk - Again, sometimes curious, usually shows no fear (who in their right mind would attack a skunk?!?!?)  The only time I've been the target of a spray was when I surprised one, overcooked a corner and yelped loudly, he was right there 2m away, but missed me.

- Jackrabbit - Somewhat common

- Great Horned Owl - Rarely see them, but frequently hear them.  There's one near Red Box that is so loud it sounds like a barking dog.

- Black Bear - Four sightings on Rincon Road since spring.  I had the good fortune to watch a large bear 'work' some beehives in a stand of black oaks on Oat Mountain - went from tree to tree, climbed upper branches and shook like hell to dislodge the hives?

- Tarantula - Rare sighting, but always impressive.

- Bobcat - Very rare, usually curious enough to sit roadside and watch me pass.

- Mountain Lion - Heard twice at night, only seen 3x daytime, very very rare!  One sighting was on Mulholland Drive at 2:00 PM, within 300m of a residential neighborhood.

"MLS","t5_2rbnb","This is so huge for the league and why I don‚Äôt believe MLS has any intentions of stopping expansion at 28. 

This is it, we‚Äôre experiencing the ‚Äúawakening of the American Soccer giant‚Äù playing out in real time. Wealthy ownership and investment has finally led to a quality product on the pitch, and people have taken notice. There‚Äôs incentive for other wealthy ownership groups to pursue MLS and the fallout has resulted in an explosion in the quality of play/ average attendance in MLS AND the lower divisions. Which is huge. And I think we will see it all come to the forefront when the world comes to visit in 2026..

Here in Cincinnati for example, the game has absolutely exploded onto the scenes. I mean out of no where it became the thing to do in town, it‚Äôs been awesome to witness first hand and be a part of. And the key hasn‚Äôt been just bringing soccer to people, we‚Äôve had numerous pro teams fail here in Cincy. It‚Äôs bringing people a quality product that‚Äôs exciting and worth their time and money. Carl Lindner dumped huge amounts of money and resources into presenting FCC as a ‚ÄúMajor League‚Äù club from day 1. He brought in big names, experienced coaches/staff,  and was willing to take losses to ensure all the games were televised all in an effort to present top level product on the field. And it paid off exponentially, in 3 years we went from literally 0 soccer identity, to one of the most avid soccer fan bases in the country and being considered a shoe in to the countries top flight league. 

Which brings me back to my point, there are literally 40+ markets in the US capable of supporting an MLS franchise. Sacramento, Detroit, San Antonio, Phoenix, San Diego, North Carolina, Tampa, Louisville, Austin, Chicago 2, Indianapolis, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, etc etc. That is BIG $$$$$, I mean it‚Äôd be tens of Billions of dollars in expansion fees alone. And for those asking what it will take for the National team to become relevant, or fans of moving to promotion and relegation this is what it will take. 40+ major markets capable of supporting a club, complete with dedicated fan bases, academy‚Äôs, training facilities, stadiums, etc. If we can get to that point, with the size of the US, it‚Äôll be hard for anyone else in the world to keep up with that. Combined with the draw of quality of living/ raising a family in the US and we have all the potential to become a world soccer powerhouse. 

That‚Äôs my 2 cents at least.

Edit: tl:Dr Owning an MLS club has become a profitable, incentivizing/attracting wealthy Billionaire ownership groups and drastically raising the level of the game in the US. Timing couldn‚Äôt be better with WC 2026 around the corner.

"reptiles","t5_2qy22","Get a betta. As long as the tank hasn't been cleaned with soap, a betta is what you want. They are amicable, more so than the leos I kept, and they are much less stressed out by people than any reptile. They recognize people and can be trained to do tricks if you are willing to put in the time.

Both reptiles cannot live in a 10g their entire life and the constant presence and noise of students will stress them out to no end. 

Leopard geckos are very reclusive, wanting to shy away from most interaction, whether it be touch, sound, or light. They will need a varied diet, as they can get metabolic bone disease and fatty liver from only having once source of food. They will drop their tail if provoked into doing so. They loose toes if the humidity is not correct. They can even go blind due to multiple bad sheds. If stressed they will refuse food and starve themselves for months. I know this because I had rescued a couple that were too far gone for me to save.

Bearded dragons get BIG. They also need a diet of both fresh vegetables and live insects daily, with the components changing as they age. They also require UV lighting, otherwise they too will get metabolic bone disease. Being from Australia, they require hot basking spots to digest and cooler areas to rest. When stressed, they will go off food and if scared, bite hard. 

Bettas are easier to take care of, but still require effort to get set up. You will need to read into the nitrogen cycle and their heating requirements. The r/bettafish wiki has everything you will need to know. They are some of the most personable small fish out there.

Another option would be a tarantula. They are much easier to take care of, mainly having humidity requirements, but will get stressed due to light and frequent handling. ",1533081983

After living with his (male) partner of many years, he decided he wanted to start coming back to church. From the [Deseret News](https://www.deseretnews.com/article/865688689/Gay-brother-of-Mormon-apostle-shares-his-spiritual-journey.html):

&gt;About 10 years ago, he found himself standing outside the front door of LDS Bishop Bruce Larson in New Canaan, Connecticut. He introduced himself, explained he was gay and in a relationship, and wondered if he was welcome at the LDS Church.

&gt;""His instantaneous comment was we‚Äôd love to have you come and hope you‚Äôll bring your partner. We‚Äôd like to get to know both of you. The mission that we‚Äôre on in the ward is to become more effective disciples of Christ. You can help us. We all bring something and work on that effort together,"" Christofferson said. ""I think what stands out is that I could be honest about my life and still be welcomed to join the Saints to worship. We talk about the qualifications to enter the temple, and perhaps forget that the qualifications to enter a chapel are simply a desire to know Christ and the courage to show up.""

The ward ended up embracing both him and his partner (though eventually Tom broke it off with his partner and got rebaptized, which is bittersweet but not really relevant here).

Obviously none of us can predict how your bishop and ward will react to you, but this is how they should. You belong just as much as anyone else. If you're interested in trying out a return to some level of activity, I hope you do, and pray that you have a positive experience!",1533081987

"AskScienceDiscussion","t5_2vlah","What would be the point of your micro splitter?  If you need 3 photodiodes per pixel, then essentially you are just making a sensor with either 3x the pixel density, or 1/3 the number of pixels.  A Bayer array would likely perform better in both of those cases, and is far, far easier to fabricate.  The issues with demosaicing are pretty exaggerated, and largely go away when the pixel density is high relative to the sharpness of the lens.

&gt; Other ideas for a better camera sensor includes logarithmic A/D conversion.

What would that buy you?  The noise is mostly coming from the pixel, not the ADC.

&gt; It works in which if a region is collecting photons at an extremely rapid pace, the photon collection stops early and everywhere else stops on time.

Isn't this basically equivalent to what the HDR function on a phone camera does -- snaps 2 or 3 images with different exposure in rapid succession?  A normal CMOS pixel is not individually addressable, so you can't have different exposure time for different pixels and not have something like a rolling shutter.

In the end, most ideas like that are fairly obvious, and were most likely thought of and rejected due to reasons of either cost, performance, or ease of manufacturing.  Unless you have a novel way of implementing e.g. your prisms, it's unlikely that your proposal would be interesting to sensor manufacturers.  In particular, cost is usually the critical variable in any engineering design, and when something increases cost it has to be compared with the obvious alternative of e.g. making the sensor bigger.

"vaporroguelite_dev","t5_mbh3b","**Catenary**

In physics and geometry, a catenary (US: , UK: ) is the curve that an idealized hanging chain or cable assumes under its own weight when supported only at its ends.

The catenary curve has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a parabolic arch, but it is not a parabola.

The curve appears in the design of certain types of arches and  as a cross section of the catenoid‚Äîthe shape assumed by a soap film bounded by two parallel circular rings.

The catenary is also called the alysoid, chainette, or, particularly in the materials sciences, funicular.Mathematically, the catenary curve is the graph of the hyperbolic cosine function.

I don't deny the strenght of the item. It's actually OP on the hero in the very lategame. Once you start stealing like 100 Int and your base dmg is +200 you start criting insanely. That alone makes it worth it alongside the +25 int and 60 dmg, which is essentially a Daedalus. Not to forget the attack speed which is something OD really like and preferably wants every item he has to provide, on top of that the mana regen bonus helps a lot too.

The active is also strong, you can burst anyone and watch him die, but the fact it's dispelled so easily sucks.  

Imo infact it's a must have a item when it's very late in the game and you wanna start destroying, regardless of if u have mkb already or not.

The old MKB the was heaven on the hero. The new one is just meh. You just don't click as fast to make it worth, and the bonus proc/dmg feels like a waste on him, since he doesn't click fast. For me it's like getting a Daedalus on Zeus.

I'm yet to see someone experiment with Mjollnir OD. Since now it procs evasion, gives a shit ton of attack speed, more CC damage, and wave clear.",1533081992

"PFSENSE","t5_2ruru","As far as I know Google's DNS servers don't have any type of blocking of malicious sites.  Plus I know for a fact they track your DNS lookups.  If you are logging into any Google accounts over your VPN then they can connect your DNS lookups to you.  I would never use Google for DNS.  Quad9 blocks malicious sites and ""claims"" they don't log.  That's why I connect through the VPN, just in case.  You could also just use your VPN's DNS servers.  I'm using Quad9 because PIA's MACE (Private Internet Access' ad and malicious sites blocking using DNS) doesn't work well unless you use their software or according to them you can connect through Https to their DNS servers withing one minute of the VPN tunnel being active.  I wasn't about to try to figure that out.  Other good DNS include [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1) which doesn't block but also doesn't log and OpenDNS which log but can block not only malicious but any category you wan't (i.e. porn, gambling).  But to use OpenDNS for blocking you have to set up an account.

Netgate has instructions on how to setup DNS over TLS in pfSense: [https://www.netgate.com/blog/dns-over-tls-with-pfsense.html](https://www.netgate.com/blog/dns-over-tls-with-pfsense.html).  I would also check out the April 2018 Netgate Hangout on DNS in pfSense which goes over it in great detail: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CISZn804WI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CISZn804WI).  The only extra step I took was to setup two OpenVPN Clients to different VPN servers and then in General Setup you can set the gateway for each DNS Server you have setup.  The Hangout explains this for multi-wan but it's the same basic configuration for multiple VPN tunnels.  [nguvu.org](https://nguvu.org) also has a nice tutorial on setting up multiple VPN tunnels and load balancing between them.

I have Spectrum 100/10 right now and I'm getting 118mbps with no VPN and 108mbps through one of my VPN tunnels.  I use both PIA and NordVPN.  I originally signed up for PIA but Hulu won't work for them when connecting through an Android device so I purchased NordVPN.  I tried ExpressVPN but could only find one US server that worked with Hulu.  I also had TorGuard for awhile and used firewall rules to send just Netflix and Hulu through one of their ""streaming IPs"" but first Netflix blocked the IP and then Hulu stopped working when I split the https traffic over multiple VPN tunnels so I switched to NordVPN.

The NetGate hangout also explains how to force every client on your LAN to use pfSense DNS Resolver.  I did this for all my VLANs but one I have setup for ""private""  I use TOR sometimes through this and I didn't want it forced to a specific DNS.  I can also check if my DNS blocking or setup is working against me by connecting from that VLAN directly to a public DNS.  

There is also a great tutorial [here](https://www.techhelpguides.com/2017/06/12/ultimate-pfsense-openvpn-guide/) about how to setup VPN tunnels, DNS and multiple routes depending on firewall rules.  Let me know if you have any more questions.",1533081992

What I found is that fully kitted out melee fex they are just too many points and at that point there is literally no reason not to run them as a dakka fex. Combine the two options for dakka fex: ES+Spores+2x devourer+hvc for your backline and 4x devourer, massive acid maw, spores and bone mace as your frontline. Ran as jormy.
  
24 S6 AP0 shots is much more threatening against most things than 2xMST are, and if they really want to get into melee with a 4 S6 AP-5 swings then by all means best be able to kill it otherwise its swinging back and hurting you.
  
The only viable melee fex is a stonecrusher and even then we cant upgrade them with all the fancy stuff so theyre rough to run for the cost.",1533081994

"NoMansSkyTheGame","t5_325lr","I also agree with most of what you said ( and, not that it matters, I also spent *alot* of hours on those other game you listed) but there some point i disagree with:

Things taking too long: the fact that you learn words so slowly is actually fun for me. the more you progress, the more you can understand a specific race and make out what they want and needs. the 'time sink' you mention about ship turning around on landing pad is so little that it is literally unnoticeable for me. I also personally never had a flight of more than a min and a half and i usually take that time to sort my inventory/check my quests, send a text or something else. so again, that really doesn't bother me. It is, imo, a much more contemplative game than the other of his genre so having some extra time to look around is really enjoyable for me.

I do agree that mining resources (like rocks) does feel tedious at time tho.

' See one planet and you've seen 95% of the planets in the game. ' also have to disagree on that. I mean. sure rocks are rocks and trees are trees. but there is enough variations that I feel your sentence is way overly exaggerated.

' extreme world being trivial with modules ' well that's the point. you search for those crazy module so you can actual have the time to explore without having to go back to safety every 5min. and, unless i'm mistaken they are not THAT common to find (the modules)

'the timer that you have to wait for to get a new quest' Again, I feel like it forces you to do some other stuff, explore more, continue along another questline. to me it's totally acceptable.

In the romantic languages the focus was on vocabulary and individual words; we weren't taught much on sentence structure till a couple years in and none of the vocab had stuck with me.

In Japanese class we learned hiragana and very basic vocab alongside sentence structure and grammar. I was able to write full, but very simple paragraphs in hiragana by the end of the first year.

Katakana was bullshit though. And I never got a significant amount of vocabulary, but I knew how to ask for directions, please and thank you and greetings, small talk, ordering, counting different things, how to ask what things are and I got currencies down as well. After two years of high school.

"OnePieceTC","t5_36oy2","Only reroll if you are a completely new player (no attachment at all to your current account) and if you are willing to sit down for a good 3 or 4 hours (depending on how good you want your account to be). 

If you do want to reroll this is probably one of the best times to do it because of 3X exp and the free rewards. Just realize that rerolling gets you like 50 gems so 1 multi and a few singles. This won't give you a great chance at getting amazing units which may cause you to do a ton of rerolls.

I would recommend grinding on your current account to 80 gems and doing two multi to see what your guaranteed legend is. If it's something amazing (Luffy ace or Lucy) don't even think of rerolling. If it's something less stellar and you didn't get anything else that good, consider rerolling. 

If your going to reroll tonight, see if you can scrape together 30 gems through Story mode or whatever to try and get that guaranteed legend.
Another way is to wait for the 35mil community reward and try to reroll off that.

So basically, I recommend grinding to 80 gems and seeing what you get first. If it's bad, reroll either tonight or reroll off of 35 mill reward.

If you don't know what you want/when to stop there are some YouTube videos talking about it. I recommend looking for legend Teri lists by Sekapoko or Toadskii. If you get one of the better legends you can stop. ",1533081998

&gt;I‚Äôm all ears. A huge part of our economy, trillions of dollars, with a really easy solution.

We eliminate insurance and third payers universally.  No medicare, medicaid, insurance, HMO's, reimbursement accounts.....none of it.  We adopt a market system in which you pay for care as needed or [buy a subscription based care](https://www.businessinsider.com/direct-primary-care-a-no-insurance-healthcare-model-2017-3) from a doctor or hospital system that allows you to be seen without regard to single cost.

Second tier is allowing all health care expenses to be tax deductible, deducting to the entirety of care over time.  For example, if you receive a $10,000 bill you can use a few thousand every year to lower your tax rate.  For both individuals and businesses.  This incentivizes businesses to reimburse employees for health care as a charity as it allows them to drop funds to employees and write off the whole of the expense as opposed to now where insurance isn't something they can deduct.  Since charities already are deductible, you would have medical charities become more common and allow people to use their services if they cannot otherwise afford medical care.

We could also incentivize medical savings as well, by making them tax preferred accounts for investment activity like a 401k or roth IRA.",1533081998

However prison services are rapidly privatizing. Know a guy who was in prison. During his last year they got rid of their kitchen staff and stopped buying food from a regular supplier.

One problem, they cut the daily caloric intake of inmates from 2000 kcal to 1200 kcal. The inmates were now always grouchy, there was a bunch of fighting. 

The same happened with laundry service. They just went longer between laundry days.

with more SaGa support, more classics can be ported and localized. I would like the original Romancing SaGa to be ported and localized on modern platforms too.   it would be a worthwhile investment for SE, and would raise the SaGa brand.

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","Ooh. Good question! I've been teaching privately since about 2004/2005 and teaching at universities since 2010 so I've thought a lot about these things. I'll try to answer each question individually.

&amp;nbsp;

**1.** I have a few different versions of a 'starting curriculum' for different kinds of students. The needs of a 14-year old beginner are very different to someone preparing an audition to get into university which are different again from a guy in his 40s who just wants to jam with his friends on the weekends. There are some things I try to make sure all my students cover though.

&amp;nbsp;
 
First, I make sure their technique is passable. It doesn't have to be 100% perfect - we can work on that over time - but if they start off with dodgy technique (extreme angles in their wrists, being tense all the time etc.) then the chances of them hurting themselves goes way up. This is trickier in players who have been playing for a while but with dodgy technique. It means you have to replace their bad habits with better ones, which can take a while and can be frustrating for the student.

&amp;nbsp;
 
Next, is rhythm. It comes naturally to a lot of people, but others struggle with it. If that's the case, then I'll get them to do some basic rhythm exercises - clapping rhythms or tapping them on their bass so they can start to internalize it. If they can't do that, then it'll be that much harder for them to do it when they start to play.

&amp;nbsp;

From there, it's really up to the individual student. Before we even have our first lesson, I'll have a pretty in-depth conversation with them to figure out exactly what they want to do, what they've done before as well as what kind of music they're into. From that conversation, we'll make a plan together. If it's someone who just wants to play on the weekend with his buddies, I'm not going to bombard him with a ton of theory and scales. The lessons will be more song-based. I once had a student who just wanted to learn 2 songs so he could play with his brothers and sister at their parents wedding anniversary party, so that's all we worked on - those 2 songs. Of course if they're curious, you can teach them some of that stuff and you'll usually be able to tell if they're into it or not. If they are, then go for it. If not, then you don't need to cover that will them.

&amp;nbsp;

If they're wanting to learn how to improvise or play walking bass lines, then I do go more into the theory side of things with scales, arpeggios and all that, but I'll also listen to recordings with them to show how other people use all that stuff to actually make music.

&amp;nbsp;

If they're preparing for something specific like an audition to get into music school, we'll target all the skills that they'll need to do well there. Things like reading, playing different styles, possibly some theory stuff if it's required. Everyone needs slightly different things so I always cater what I do to what the student wants, but also sneak in the things that they need, but may not yet realize it.

&amp;nbsp;

**2.** I have my own website that I occasionally send students to if they ask a question about something I have on there, but in general, I don't teach from sites or books. One thing I do all the time though is tell my students to check out music and tell them what to look for in the music. For example, I might tell a student to check out a Ray Brown Trio album to see how Ray drives the whole band with his bass lines or listen to John Mayer recordings to see how a simple bass line can work, or some James Jamerson to see how a busy bass line can work. For me, I always found using actual music was the best way to get things across. Bonus points if you can show them some insight they hadn't noticed from music they already like.

&amp;nbsp;

**3.** I've never rented out instruments personally. I did lend a bass to a student one time, but he was the brother of a good friend of mine so I trusted him not to break it/run away with it. Usually though, if a student is actively looking for lessons, chances are they already have an instrument. Obviously there will always be exceptions and if you're willing to rent them out, then you can do that. If you'd rather not, you can always refer them to any music shops in your area that do rent instruments out.

&amp;nbsp;

**4.** I don't really have an outline or anything because I really do cater what I teach depending on the student. I can tell you that one mistake I used to make a lot was teaching things I knew my student needed to work on before I gave them things they **wanted** to work on. I wasn't meeting them where they were and I was trying to 'drag them up' to where I wanted them to be. This didn't work out at all. My students got bored because there wasn't anything in it for them. It was like feeding them nothing but vegetables. It was good for them, but they hated it. Now I always try to get the student to buy in to the lessons by teaching them something that gets them excited and then pivoting to something they need to learn. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've found the best way of doing this is by connecting the thing they like with whatever I want them to do. For example, if they have the flying fingers problem and they want to learn a certain tricky bass line, I'll explain that the only way to get the bass line clean and fast (the way it sounds on the recording) is to make sure their fingers stay close to the fretboard. From there, we can transition to a technical exercise that will help them with that. Instead of just going straight to the exercise, they know the exercise is going to help them do something they already want to do.

&amp;nbsp;

Getting better at teaching is something I'm constantly working on. It's just like music - there's always more to learn. I hope this helps though. ",1533082003

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","The issue I've got is in THEORY I should be able to hop into competitive and be put against folks around my skill level (broadly speaking) and then either climb or sink toward my 'correct' rank or wahtever.

But with what we have here, my choice is go into competitive and get deleted by people WAY better than me (so much better, in general, that it is difficult to learn from the experience much of the time), or go into quickplay... and have a similar experience.

It really seems like this change has been doing more to feed low-skill players to high skill players than was previously the case.

And none of it would matter if competitive was worth a damn, which is the really sad part.

But for me, I find quickplay no less brutal or 'sweaty' than Competitive.  I don't see fewer wormhusk poledancers, I don't see fewer antiope/grav lance players.  It's about the same - probably more since there are more guardians in each match - and that's the frustrating part.

Those of us who are below average and/or mediocre really only HAVE one PvP option these days and that option is 'be miserable', unfortunately.

This is a reasonable question, whether we should focus on reclaiming terms to become neutral, or whether we should just change them to neutral versions.

I've never been to the UK and so decided to look up information on the town. If you are from that area please let me know if any of this is incorrect. 

Saltburn-by-the-Sea is a small town of about 6,000 people. In December the weather tends to range between 0 C/32 F and 7 C/45 F with roughly 59 MM/2.32 in or precipitation. To give that some context, in December Saltburn receives roughly the same amount of precipitation as Detroit and Atlanta though less than Boston. According to [UK government data](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/climate/stationdata/durhamdata.txt) from a weather station in Durham (just inland from Saltburn), the weather in December 1992 was very typical. Given this information and the fact that they were taking a walk I assume the weather was calm and pleasant, though chilly. 

I couldn't determine the location of the public restroom from which he disappeared. However, there are [two public restrooms along the shore](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1CASMAI_enUS792US792&amp;q=public+restroom+saltburn+by+the+sea&amp;npsic=0&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=0&amp;rllag=54585526,-969308,137&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjYvYLbwMrcAhXpy4MKHQqLDtQQtgN6BAgBEAQ&amp;tbs=lrf:!2m1!1e2!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:2&amp;rldoc=1#rlfi=hd:;si:;mv:!1m3!1d1532.3399191820236!2d-0.9691383181004767!3d54.5853681605389!3m2!1i946!2i509!4f13.1). Both are situated alongside roads that appear to be well-traveled and easy to navigate. The restrooms at the intersection of Saltburn Road and Saltburn Bank is visible on [Google Streetview.](https://www.google.com/maps/@54.584847,-0.9674842,3a,75y,253.64h,74.27t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1swIU7bq5_3PQgFCtkuhOK6Q!2e0!7i13312!8i6656?hl=en) It is located next to a fair sized parking lot and a few businesses. I have no idea if he used one of these restrooms or if this information is useful. Given this information and the presumably mild weather I am tempted to say it was unlikely that he was hit by a car (the roads seem to have good visibility) or mugged (both are in visible, well-trafficked location) but the information is rather thin. That said, the proximity to roads and parking lots seem to indicate that he could have ended up inside a car. 

Lastly, I assume he would have left the restroom before his mother. Young tend to get in and out a bit more quickly than older women. Presumably British people have anatomies similar to people in other the rest of the world. ",1533082011

But, having spent a few centuries rebuilding in safety and covertly undermining its enemies, Gallifrey wants to return to the universe, like a former superpower reemerging from a period of stagnation and economic collapse. And the rest of the universe isn't exactly happy about it, even if the Time Lords aren't in a position to be wiped out anymore, because the Time Lords weren't the most benevolent overlords, and aren't happy at seeing their technology falling into the hands of people with their own agendas. Not that they would erupt into open war, but that there would be a new, uneasy status quo, with rival groups undermining each other, and where the Time Lords aren't unambiguous good or bad guys and the Doctor would react differently depending on the situation - sometimes they might choose to help the Time Lords he meets, while sometimes he would stop them.

I hope it doesn't happen soon, but it would be nice to see eventually.",1533082011

The long answer is that it is a company-dependent decision now and procedures are wildly different from place to place. One company I know of does UAs but doesn't test for (or care about? idk how UAs work) marijuana. Another doesn't test at all unless there is an onsite accident. Another tests everybody only upon hiring. Yet another tests randomly and enforces it.

Basically, if you're a stoner in a legal state, you need to figure out the business' stance on it before you apply. It's irritating, tbh, because it's not like cigarette smokers or frequent drinkers are penalized this way. But hey, at least it's legal here.",1533082012

I'll do anything I can to at least minimize that, and I havn't put it out in at least 2 years now.

This is the real issue at hand. If you're having trouble with hordes in legendary you shouldn't be there. You should view them as minor distractions and sources of temporary health. The only time hordes are ever a huge issue is when your team is all split up by some other thing like a boss and the horde impedes your movement.

Even if you thought they weren‚Äôt going to be as effective their second year, you knew they were going to have big workloads to make up for that.

Kamara only had 200ish touches last year and will likely get out touched by Ingram again (obviously on a per game basis since Ingram is suspended), if his efficiency takes a dip then he could bust. I think he sees a slight uptick in his touches, and he‚Äôs obviously still a very good player which is why I see him as an RB1. But I can‚Äôt see him being top 5 unless he puts up insane efficiency again, especially when guys like Johnson and Zeke are poised to play the whole year (barring injury obviously), and Barkley is added to the mix.

It‚Äôs not impossible, I think Kamara is close to the edge of being a top 5 RB, I‚Äôm just stating why I think it‚Äôs more likely he ends up as a low end RB1. ",1533082018

The last numbers I saw showed that even if you cancelled literally every social service we have and turned it in to straight cash you still couldn't float the program the way most people who support it envision it.

As as taxpayer the writing on the wall always seemed to be that raising my taxes even more was the answer to my question, although no one wanted to admit it.

Emotionally outgoing/comfortable folks are high estrogen, and the socially anxious folks are low estrogen.

High testosterone is the intellectually curious/outgoing, and low testosterone is the sort to be more likely to follow others, intellectually (they are ""good students"").

High serotonin is the philosophically open-minded and optimistic, while the low serotonin is the more closed-minded and pessimistic.  (This seems like depression, too.  But is more existential than physical.)

The largest similar programs he helped enact were Medicare and Medicaid, which are both riddled with problems. Why should anyone believe a Democrat who says, ""Vote for me and I'll do even better than Medicare""? We should be dismantling and privatizing these terrible programs so they can actually work, not adding more government bureaucracy to double down on 50 year old mistake.

&gt;The majority of people would be paying significantly less under Medicare for all than under the current ‚Äúsystem‚Äù.. Plus, wouldn‚Äôt the success of universal healthcare in other developed countries indicate overhauling the US system is needed?

This is simply untrue, and no economist agrees with you. There simply aren't enough rich people to steal enough from to pay for this for more than a couple years. $32 trillion more over 10 years. That's about a $3.2 trillion increase in the annual federal budget, which is already $3.6 trillion.
