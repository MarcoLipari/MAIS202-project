How is it that German police, with sidearms, are so good at not shooting innocent people? or at missing their shots?  I think it's because they are accountable for stray bullets, and culpable for homicide if they kill an innocent.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","&gt;  no test produces raw scores directly on the scale's coordinates

This is false.  The vast majority of psychometric scales have not gone through the extensive validation and norming of an IQ test where raw counts of items correct or points earned across items are then normed by age or gender or whatever and then cross-walked to a standard score ala a ""transformation table"" (which if you understood my last post you would realize I have a deep understanding of -- when I drew the distinction between a raw score and a standardized score I was envisioning the transformation table....doh).  

I could name dozens of scales that I have used in my own research, or where I have consulted on a project where that scale was used, where the raw score is all you have, where at most perhaps the raw score is compared to a ""scale"" with cut-off values that indicate, for example, no depression, mild depression, moderate depression, or severe depression.  Here, look at the BDI, it is so obvious an example that proves the point and shows, once again, that you are drawing broad generalizations about things you have not mastered.

http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/NMCP2/PatientServices/SleepClinicLab/Documents/Beck_Depression_Inventory.pdf

How can you look at that and tell me ""no test produces raw scores directly on the scale's coordinates""?  It is so direct and easy that Beck declared a lay person who has never seen the BDI before can do it themselves.  

To be clear on this point, what you did here is you made a broad statement without stopping to consider that there are plenty of scales and tests that are criterion based, not normed.  And then you think I am wording things poorly.  Laughing to myself here, do undergrads really behave like this these days?

&gt; you don't understand the theory behind norm-reference testing 

This is also false.  Laughably false.  And no, I don't know how or why Lewis Terman landed on a SD = 16 but he got there before Weschler developed the WAIS, and so Weschler adopted SB's mean of 100 but set his SD one unit smaller knowing that would be a distinguishing characteristic -- just large enough to to be noticable in the literature, but not so large as to make it difficult to compare a Weschler IQ of 120 to a SB IQ of 121.  And with a mean of 100 and SD = 15 it is easier to do the quick mental math and know that an IQ of 90 is about 2/3rds of a SD below the mean and picture where that is on the normal curve with your mind's eye.  The mental math is not so easy when SD = 16, so Weschler either made a wise choice, or just adopted SD = 15 and got lucky that his standard has a wee advantage when it comes to simplicity of interpretation (on top of the huge advantage the Weschler tests have with regard to simpler materials, easier administration, faster set-up, faster scoring, and all that being true when you learn the WMS, thus making the Weschler franchise much more successful with regard to broad adoption).

And lo and behold when I check the SB and WAIS descriptions on wikipedia, I see that my mentor's major advisor, Bob Thorndike, was lead author on the 1986 revision of the SB.  But by then nobody was using SB in mainstream clinical work which explains why I did not know that -- likely we used the prior 3rd edition kits because I only administered one SB in my entire career.

&gt; Do you know why an IQ has a mean of a 100 and SD 15 and not 10, 20 or 40?

I know it is a trivial question because M = 100 and SD = 15 is a completely arbitrary convention.  There is nothing magical or special about those numbers, they are used because Terman and then Weschler set a precedence, not because SD = 10 or SD = 20 would not have worked.

&gt;  your original example was poorly worded

Exactly what was unclear and thus caused you to immediately become confused and start saying that all samples have a mean IQ = 100?  I think the issue here is not poor wording on my part, but you jumping the gun and thinking you could school me without checking your own use of vocabulary.

&gt; I recognize though that you're a tests user not a tests builder

This is a perceptual error on your part.  Again, laughable, but there it is -- I've probably forgotten more about scale development, having consulted on so many different studies across so many different domains, than you will ever be exposed to.

&gt; this might be why our perspective regarding the mathematics of psychological testing is different

You've not said anything about your perspective that merits discussion, other than when you make broad generalizations that are easy to disprove, or get confused when someone describes a thought experiment of drawing a sample and you go down a rabbit hole on a meaningless ""norming"" exercise.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","First things first - as I'm sure you're aware, TRP is utter filth and is poisonous to anything resembling healthy relationships. Real love is about trust, communication, respect, and chemistry, not emotional manipulation. Stop reading it immediately.

As a guy in my mid-to-late 20s, I've dated both younger and older women, up to 7 years my senior. In all honesty, I've never felt like the younger ones were particularly more attractive. On a mental level, if anything the capacity for attraction dramatically increases with age, as you gain a better understanding of human interaction and get better at reading subtle cues. You mentioned you're different looking; I can see how that would be a difficult hurdle but not impossible to deal with, especially considering you've had relationships before. It might mean you have to think outside the typical dating box to find the right person for you, but believe me, there are plenty of decent guys in a similar position to yours. It may take some brave decisions to put yourself out there and make a move when you meet someone you like. 

I sometimes feel the same way you do, that ""all the good women are already taken"". Of course there is a grain of truth to this, as more people tend to enter stable relationships as time goes on. But experience has shown that this isn't as overwhelming as you might think, and I know plenty of single people, male and female, aged 30 and up who are wonderful and deserving of a great partner. It does get harder to find people, but don't give up. ","1417392006"

We sortof gave up on changing the format and everyone went a long with it. As such we built our whole road network around it, unfortunately we found out the other two big developers of cars (Germany and 'Murica) had done exactly the same thing, but mirrored, to which we said BOLLOCKS and just kept with what we had since it was too late to change everything.

Second, we don't tax that heavily on the big stuff like heating or electricity or income and healthcare is free. However, to make up for the fact that we don't slit your throat with bills, we have this annoying thing called VAT. As such whenever you buy anything, you're being taxed. Everything bought in this country has a 17.5% price increase because otherwise the icecaps would melt or baby seals would explode.

Public transport in this country is infact shit, one time a swiss man came to Britain and died from stress waiting on a connection between Manchester and Birmingham because he had never seen a train be over an hour late, True story. Sometimes a bus will come,. sometimes it won't, sometimes two will show up and other times it will just drive straight past without stopping. Honestly you'd get where you are going faster is you crawled along the wrong side of the road into oncoming traffic.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","Some of the responses in here are pretty accurate but are subject to some misconceptions in regards to creatine. Does it increase water rention? Yes. Does it directly increase muscle mass or strength? No. The top post explaining creatine monohydrate and its role in enhancing physiologicsl energy systems is accurate, but a little more information is needed.

 Cr will incease ATP availability in the creatine phopshate energy system. This system supplies energy for the first 10~12 seconds of activity. So, how exactly does Cr supplementatiom affect this? Essentially it results in an extention of the total duration of that energy pathway-- from 10s to 15s perhaps. For your power athletes and sprinters, this is huge. For general strength gains, not so much. 

What it DOES mean for general strength training. Your normal 10 rep max may become a 12 rep max due to greater availability of energy equating to an extra rep or two. This is where the strength gains come from. Improvement in strength is a function of time under tension and this increase in #reps performed increases time under tension increases strengtj and\or mass gains over time.

Thats it in a nutshell, to supplement the top post. 

Some additional information, Cr has also been reported to increase strength of connective tissues which is also of potential use as you increase strength and put your tendons and ligaments under greater strains.

As to the amount and timing, id have to go back and reference articles from a sports nutrition class, but a loading phase of app. 17g/d for 5 days is essential before beginning your 5g/d maintenance phase. The above value is approximate, total value for loading is dependent on body mass. Id have to look it up.

They visited Jackson's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and his family's home, as well as Forest Lawn Memorial Park. Many of the fans were carrying sunflowers and other tribute items to drop off at the sites. Members of the Jackson family and close friends arrived to pay their respects. Katherine returned to Gary, Indiana to unveil a granite monument constructed in the front yard of the family home. The memorial continued with a candlelight vigil and a special performance of ""We Are the World"". On June 26, there was a protest march in front of the Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division at the old Parker Center building and a petition with thousands of signatures demanding justice was delivered. The Jackson Family Foundation in conjunction with Voiceplate presented ""Forever Michael"", an event bringing together Jackson family members, celebrities, fans, supporters and the community to celebrate and honor his legacy. A portion of the proceeds were presented to some of Jackson's favorite charities. Katherine also introduced her new book ""Never Can Say Goodbye"".","1417392015"

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","Alright, so most of this is just recapping what labor and work is and what the defines labor and work.  I know most of this and agree with you about the difference between work and labor in a capitalist versus an anarchist society, so I won't deal with that.

&gt; The obligation to work comes from the need to produce goods in order to survive. You can either work two hours a week and reap the benefits of the collective effort of your entire community or you can go it alone - spending far more time labouring than not - for a fraction of the reward. If you do not want to work at all, then go ahead, hopefully the community would be willing to accommodate you. It is their decision at the end of the day.

&gt;Labour is a necessary aspect of human survival, we cannot live unless we exert energy to produce the things we need. It should be the social responsibility of every individual to take part in the creation of the collective wealth of their community not out of some moral obligation but because the alternative requires much more energy for a much smaller reward. There is a reason humans came together into tribes in the first place.

This, I can deal with.  First, I am not obliged to work for survival.  I can do no work and provide old useful objects and material for trade.  Or, I could provide a service that makes use of no labor.  I.e., I could write you a poem, unless we are going to define everything that requires effort as work. Or, I could have the needs I have for survival met by the good graces of others. I don't need to produce my own products for my survival, so how am I obliged to work for these?  It must be something else that obliges me.

I am aware of Kropotkin's labor ideas.  I don't think you even use your internal logic of what labor is.  Why all this emphasis on rewards for labor?  Isn't being reimbursed for labor a capitalist wage system?  

I also don't see why the community is more important than me.  Why are the needs of the community more than my needs?  What impels me to help them, my survival?  Doesn't that mean that the community acts like a dictator over my existence, stifling my freedom?  If the community does not provide for me, then I would naturally not provide for them.  I agree, but what coheres the community to me?  If I only need to work two hours, I am not important and my work isn't valuable, so therefore if we are bound to communities through work, I'm rather useless/there is no reason for the community to uphold any obligation to me, as they can simply find other people.  Then, does that mean that I'm bonded to the community through social relations, if it isn't via work, as my work is more than worthless?  Personally, I'm a very unpleasant person and can't see myself surviving in an Anarchist society if it's ALL based on social relations.

Labor is not necessary for human's survival.  The good will and understanding of others is necessary.  Once again, where does the social responsibility to work for a community come from?  If there is no obligation to feed me when I don't work, or provide for me just because it's right, I have no obligation to the community as they have simply said that my right to exist is not inherent in my humanity and is dependant on what I can do for others for a reward.  That is essentially capitalism.

Do you want a double blind long term human study done on wi-fi? How about new episodes of the simpsons? 

We don't need them because there's no theoretical method of harm? 

Strange. That's why we don't need them on GM crops. 

People who are anti-gm get called anti-science because by and large you people don't understand the science. You trumpet shoddy, poorly done studies until the cows come home while claiming every other study is corrupt. You like to grasp at random scientific terms and ideas without having any idea of their relevance or purpose. 

If anyone it's doing mental gymnastics it's you guys, trying to constantly fight against science just to cling to the idea that natural is somehow better (don't forget to keep eating that delicious organic crop created by bathing the seeds in radiation though, yumyum).

First there weren't enough studies. Then there weren't long enough studies (thanks to seralini thousands of keyboard warriors suddenly knew more about toxicological studies than the medical and scientific establishment), now it's no long term human studies. Shifting goal post after shifting goalpost, desperate to hang on to the notion that us altering our food with a more accurate method than we've been using to alter it for all of recorded history is somehow making it worse. 

I'm used to whack job conspiracy posts on the internet, so I guess the only thing that surprises me about the whole anti-gm thing is that none of its advocates seem to twig that this whole movement is funded by people who profit directly from the paranoia it causes.
One of the organic supermarkets who funded the Seralini study even had a massive 'gm-free' campaign that hit at the same time the study was released ffs. 

But no, no, it's everyone else who is corrupt. Even if no one can find anything wrong with any of their studies (asides from where the money came from).

1) Look for straight leg cuts, not skinny, and see if that helps you feel less big in the middle (there won't be that drastic reduction in pant width so there's a bit less contrast).

2) Sizing up won't usually work if the cut of the waist isn't right for you. What makes you think they look frumpy? Are you straighter throughout the waist (aka flatter butt)? If that's the case, look only for pants that are cut that way.

Can I get some help with AO?

I'm thinking about a composition consisting of these monsters:  


**Luer, Shimitae (L), Megan** as a core and depending on the enemy I'll use either **Guillame, Ardella or Raoq** to deal the damage.  

I'm not sure about the potential of the following monsters which I'm raising meanwhile:  
Bernard, Belladeon and Ahmann  


The problem about Ahmann is that I don't have any decent runes to get him anywhere near 100% crit.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","So far I've played Esper control extensively and recently started experimenting with Azorius. Esper control has a really hit or miss mana base but performs really well using a variety of removal, counters, and strong win cons like [[Elspeth, Sun's Champion]]. Probably the most expensive control deck cuz of mana base and  Elspeths etc. Azorius and Dimir from what I've seen so far both have very few problems with mana. Dimir has a good early game and an absolute buttload of removal but lacks a strong sweeper (other than [[Perilous Vault]] which isn't that great imo due to the mana/prep required to get it to go off.) Azorius also has a strong early game with access to stuff like [[Devouring Light]], [[Last Breath]], and [[Banishing Light]]. They also have [[End Hostilities]] which is the best sweeper you can get right now, but they lack in the kill-on-demand department. Banishing Light is the only reliable way to get rid of planeswalkers and other troublesome non-creatures without countering them. Azorius has access to both [[Pearl Lake Ancient]] and Elspeth as win conditions. I don't really know much about other control decks.

Overall, according to the tournament results we've seen so far, control isn't doing so great this standard. Decks like Abzan and Mardu midrange can just totally overwhelm decks that can't answer most or all plays they can make. However, I love control more than anything else so I'm determined to make it work. Hopefully you'll find a deck you'd like to build and play and I hope I helped you at least a little.","1417392024"

So, nice of you to see the asshole driver's side of things. Thing is, the asshole driver is obliged by provincial regulation to fucking do his job. Even if that includes driving to Surrey.

If you want to be taken seriously in any community which requires any level of expertise, you should learn to write with good, formal, nearly literary style English, rather than conversational English. If you sound like this in real life or when you have professional contacts (with builders, artisans or suppliers) you will get taken for a ride and your quotes are going to be 2-3 times higher than necessary. You might be smart enough to pull this off, but the rest of us don't know that if this is how you present yourself. Please be excited!

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","Things are quite simple : you need either friends or a good education. At just about any job(even working at a supermarket with crates or selling stuff) you need to have friends. There are 10 people for 1 job and qualifications are not so important ( the person who gets the job will generally do a lot to keep it, ignoring abuse). Having friend will not necessarily get you the job, but it will make it much easier.  
  
If you have an education or a trade, it's good too. If you are lucky you will be considered for a job ( and they will overwork you for a few years, then you can move on if you are lucky).  
  
If you are like me and have no friends nor education, you are basically fucked. I tried getting a job for over 1 year and nothing. I tried everything, car salesmen, car cleaner, newspaper-man(don't know the name),and a about 5 more that I don't know their name in English.   
  
I got work exactly 1 year ago, from 7. november to 7. january at a supermarket, they needed the extra help for holly day and friend got me the job. In the meantime I survived by getting ""day work"". Basically you have to know a guy that has a job for you, usually ""around the house"", cutting down trees, or butchering a pig, construction work etc

And my TLDR explanation is mostly:


'Well, imagine someone has an eye on you in a negative way, is jealous of you, and wishes you not to succeed or to fail, or something bad.



And if you have this Nazar with you, it will usually crack up, if it could prevent it.'

"electricians","t5_2slrm","Yes,

But like the chain analogy, each individual electron doesn't move the whole length (that would be a superconductor scenario...another story). You could also look at it like a long line of people waiting to buy a newly released iphone.

Folks start at the of the line, blocks away from the store. As new people enter the line; a **different** person enters the store. The whole line moved, but each person only moved a fraction of the whole line's length.

Now, if you could imagine moving the store to the end of the line and having everyone about-face, the line would reverse direction.

The folks in the middle of the line could possible never make it into the store, *but the line still moves.*

While I'm at it, and for kicks only:

* Hertz=how many times the line reverses directions per second.
* Resistance=the inverse of the width of the sidewalk.
* Voltage=the inverse of the price of the iphone.
* Current=how many folks actually enter the store per unit of time.

P.S. The ""neutral"" nomenclature will make more ""sense"" once you take into account that there are actually two ""different"" ""hots;"" at opposite phases to each other. [EDIT: In a typical Two-Phase Residential Structure] But that's another lesson. :)","1417392034"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I just got out of a relationship with someone who worked in a job making equal pay to mine (maybe a bit more or less, I didn't know her exact salary). She also didn't like to give blowjobs, haha.

I initiated the breakup, but I wouldn't say that her refusal to give blowjobs was a major factor in my decision. However, her dislike of blowjobs was part of an overall theme with her personality. She was overall too aloof, emotionally unavailable, didn't seem to value me very much. I felt like she just wanted somebody who would fit into her goal of being a woman with a successful career dating a man with an equally successful career. I felt more like a trophy or a status symbol, and that she just wanted to exert the minimum effort to keep me around because she cared primarily about her career and personal life.

I dunno, personally my preferences in women do not change no matter how much money she makes. I've been conditioned my whole life to expect to take care of myself and my family solely on my own income. So I view my partner's income more as a bonus. I don't need or want to be financially taken care of. That's just me though and I know other men may feel differently.

Anyway I wouldn't worry too much about not wanting to give blowjobs. IMO you're better off finding someone who doesn't like getting  them that much. Rather than trying to force yourself to do it or whatever. But definitely give it a fair chance if you haven't already. ","1417392035"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Yeah it's for homeless addicts (heroin addicts too), not for people going out to party. It's not like you can buy it at the pharmacy, you need to go to one of the places that take care of the addicts. There you will get your heroin/needles and coke. You get a private room to do it in and then you're done and go back to the homeless center. Now you don't have to spend every waking moment looking for crimes to commit, just to get enough money to get your fix. Now you are free in some sense to do other things. You live this much easier life for a time and since you're not constantly wondering about your next fix you wander about your future and if you can change it, and then you just do it. You tell the staff that you want to get off drugs and they help you. Then a small place for you to live is found. Then they help you try to get a simple job.

The trials have shown that within a few years more than half of the hardcore addicts had quit and were living relatively normal lives. One of the clinics even had to shut down because there were not enough homeless addicts anymore.

I recommend this for several reasons.

1. It's multiple gifts, which means more presents and who doesn't love more presents?
2. If he is buying coffee out this could have huge financial implications for him; even if he buys fancy beans he will be spending way less money on coffee.
3. He will use and enjoy it every day.
4. A setup like this makes for some *really* good coffee.

"DallasStars","t5_2ro4p","It's both defense and goaltending. And it's not *just* the defensemen as the forwards have been awful at defending this year too. Though the defensemen do, in fact, suck.

I'm not sure there's a lot Nill can do about it right now though. He could probably find a better option for backup goalie. I refuse to believe there's not somebody better than Lindback out there. Though, I'm not sure I trust Nill if he were to acquire another backup. His eye for goalies has been *abysmal* so far. Ellis, Thomas and Lindback are all abjectly terrible. (it also might be time to part with goaltending coach Mike ""weak short-side goal"" Valley, whose only success story is getting a phenomenally talented goaltender to stop eating so many cheeseburgers)

As for addressing the defense? Not sure much can be done there. Nobody likes to trade good defensemen. I think that's mostly just gonna be an internal fix that the coaching staff and players have to get sorted out. There's some decent options in free agency this summer (if they get there) and now that the Stars aren't gonna have the unholy triumvirate of awful contracts that was Gonchar-Horcoff-Cole, they'll have the money to actually go after one. Of course, that doesn't help this season.

There's still a good chance this thing gets turned around. I mean, the defense actually played well the second half of last season, there's no reason they can't do it again. But it's also just as likely it continues to be awful...","1417392037"

If things are scaled either too big or too small as to be useless (quite likely), the ""home"" and ""."" (on numpad) will help zoom in and locate better around whatever is selected on the F-curve. Speeds things up a bit vs. scrolling with mousewheel or adjusting the scrollbars.

Try a lot of shoes and see what works, different lasts can give different results even if both are supposed to be the same width. Be professionally measured and know your real size, and do research on how different brands fit/compare

Certain shoes can fuck uou up, if the toe is too long it can flex in the wrong place and jab your foot or cause unnecessary wear since those areas won't be reinforced. You're probably more likely to snag on things/kick things too. ","1417392043"

First of all, the usernames of all the people talking are put at the top while their text is placed at the bottom. So, if you want to know who's saying what, you have to scroll up and down repeatedly and make sure you're following the right line.


Second, why does it begin fully indented and get progressively less indented as time goes on. It's reading right to left, which is stupid.  Then the first few comments become 1 letter per line on mobile if more than 5 people comment.


Third, autoplay is the worst invention in human history, especially when placed in the hands of people who have poor taste in music and the inability to control volume.


Fourth, that stupid thing that shows all the words that are used on their blog in varying sizes and with links to those posts? Yeah, they look like an ugly mismatch too. Plus, does anyone really look at them?


Fifth, we really need to get rid of these stupid text colors mixed with background colors that make it so you can't see the text. Who comes up with these formats?

Only a few decades ago, African Americans could not get home mortgages or live in certain neighborhoods because of their color. They couldn't get the schooling or the type of jobs that would allow them to acquire wealth that could be passed down to their children. They were not afforded the privileges that most Americans were afforded because of something they were born with and couldn't change.

MZ01: you known that this allows you to sneak pretty much any creature in on your opponent? Just trigger after blockers are declared. The copy won't be blocked.

RC01: with 3 mana this can effectively block a flier, deal 4 to an attacker, be 2/7. Seems very strong.

RZ01: face down is in two words. Also maybe it could read: ""turn ~ face down. It gets -2/-0 and can block an additional creature until end of turn."" The current wording feels slightly clunky.

UC02: feels a bit weird to add 1 at beginning of combat phase since it is gone the moment you begin to declare attackers.

UC03: I don't think you need to capitalize ""flying artifact creature"".

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Wow.  There have been so many interesting things that have happened. It's hard to pick one. Oh, I know. Let me tell you what happened last month in Vermilion City. Some friends and I were just hanging out, eating noodles and watching sunsets. Having the occasional match.  You know what I mean, just relaxing. We had just finished lunch when these three kids walk into the diner. They are really loud and arguing with each other. The little guy orders some food and starts asking where the gym is while he is eating. Food is flying every where.  I mean the kid acted like he hadn't eaten in weeks and had no manners at all. The older kid starts hitting on the waitress.  Not subtle about it either. I just knew she was about to slap him into next week when the little red headed girl with them stood up and started yelling at both of them. She told them both to stop being so self centered and to put their Pokemon ahead of their wants for a change. I'm pretty sure she was the only one who had any sense. She took hold of both of them by the ears and forced them to take their Pokemon to the Pokemon Center.  My friends and I were curious so we tailed them. The older boy immediately made a pass at the nurse, who shot him down like he was an enemy plane.  The other kid pulled out a Pokeball and out popped this completely worn out little Pikachu. I tell you, I felt so bad for this Pikachu that I wanted to go shake that little kid for not taking better care of him. Instead I walked over to give him the benefit of my years of experience. I just wanted to, you know tell him not to let his Pokemon get that worn down, to spend more time with them training them, instead of trying to win badges. That badges were not the important thing, that the Pokemon were. Well the little snot barely listened to me. He had no sooner gotten Pikachu back than he started challenging everyone there to a battle. I knelt down in front of him, so I could look him in the eye and tell him to chill out, when the girl kicked me. She started screaming for me to mind my own business. The little kid tried to sic his Pikachu on me. The older kid had made a pass at one of my friend's wife. My friend punches the kid. The kid falls into me and I end up falling into the other two kids. We all end up in the floor. Bruised and banged up. The nurse calls the cops. I end up spending two hours answering questions down at the station.  Finally the cops called social services. Apparently these kids were way to young to be trainers or to be out on their own. Social Services sent out these two strange social workers in white jumpsuits with a big ""R"" on the front and they carried the kids off. It was so strange. I just don't understand how parents can be so irresponsible. I mean can you imagine going off on your own at the age of ten? Nope. Me neither. ","1417392053"

The collecting mechanic feels great and it plays great with all player counts. Very easy to learn, you'll be playing in minutes. Quality components too. 


**Machi Koro** is a dice based game where you build a city, and the buildings you buy have certain effects on dice rolls. This game is great fun, easy to learn and quite cheap.

Of course the rich people kicked the poorer ones off that side and had them relocate on the east side where the land was not so good. This relocation created the demographic we see today still. Since concentrated poor economic standing begets crime and all the other fun stuff the east side got the bad reputation you hear of today. 

I assume that the richer people were the white ones and the poorer ones were the minorities. I don't know what the context of ""kicked out"" is either. Could have been the ugly one in where it's done by force or a perfectly legal buyout.  ","1417392058"

- [The Shadow Line (TV Mini-Series 2011)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1701920/)
- [Sunday's Game (1999)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0202202/) - it's an ~8 minute short. It's a black comedy. I think it fits. But others might disagree. Youtube might have it.

I'm sure Netflix has a list of classic film noir. Anything in the top 25 (if not top 50) is probably great. And /r/filmnoir will have all sorts of info.

And Netflix (etc) will have lists of neo-noir too.

&gt; Heissenberg dreht sich zu den anderen und sagt: ""Das ist eindeutig ein Witz, aber wie finden wir heraus, ob er lustig ist?""

Ist vermutlich eine Anspielung auf die Unschärferelation von Heisenberg. Die besagt, dass man in der Quantenphysik von einem Teilchen nur den Ort oder den Impuls aber niemals beides messen kann... Also wenn man weiß das es ein Witz ist, dann kann man nicht mehr sagen ob er lustig ist... 

&gt; Gödel antwortet: ""Können wir nicht, da wir im Witz sind.""

Das müsste eine Anspielung auf den [2. Unvollständigkeitssatz](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6delscher_Unvollst%C3%A4ndigkeitssatz#Zweiter_Unvollst.C3.A4ndigkeitssatz) von Gödel sein. 

*Jedes hinreichend mächtige konsistente formale System kann die eigene Konsistenz nicht beweisen.*

Also da wir im System ""Witz"" sind können wir bestimmte Eigenschaften nicht beweisen (vielleicht kann das ja ein Mathematiker erklären... ist zu spät dafür... )

&gt; ""Natürlich ist er lustig"", meint Chomsky, ""du erzählst ihn nur falsch!""

Chomsky hat viel in der Linguistik gearbeitet... das ist vermutlich eine Anspielung auf die [Chomsky-Hierachie](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chomsky-Hierarchie) oder andere Resultate von ihm. Ich kann mir das ""du erzählst ihn nur falsch"" nur so erklären, dass es in einer anderen Ebene der Hierachie, die z.B. mächtiger ist die Lustigkeit erkannt werden kann...  Das Beispiel dafür ist immer HTML mit Regulären-Ausdrücken parsen... das geht eben nicht von der Grammatik und Art der Sprachen her.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I dealt with a deep depression for years. I started smoking at 25 and found that it helped me to distance myself from my depression. In the beginning, the distraction was what I needed. I began to analyze my thoughts to determine the root causes that were affecting me. Later, I went to therapy and began to trace my thinking, working towards replacing those unhelpful thinking patterns (as per Cognitive Behavioural Therapy) with more logical thoughts. Marijuana, for me, seems to have a way of temporarily diminishing the ego, allowing for alternate perspectives on my own thoughts and experiences.

Weed is by no means a cure for depression in and of itself, but it sure can help, as per my own experience. I'm in a significantly better place now than I was a year ago. Your mileage may vary.

That's simply untrue.  The British would've ignored Gandhi had folks like Bhagat Singh not been running around India killing off British officials.  People like MLK were successful because politicians saw that the alternative was to sit by while cities across the country burned.  Umkhonto we Sizwe (the armed wing of the ANC, which did some extremely violent stuff) gave Mandela a lot more leverage in his fight against Apartheid.  Hell, the US wouldn't exist had there not been organizations engaging in property destruction, sabotage, and rioting in the early 1770s.

Every morning in order to make sure she gets ready for school on time without wasting the time we have, she needs to get dressed, teeth and hair brush in 20 minutes and she can have 20 minutes on the computer. More time she wastes the less time she has or none at all. 

I, unfortunately, let my frustration show. That can makes matters worse sometimes, as children learn and are little sponges of our behavior. Most of the time I have to be right here with her doing whatever the task is I asked her to do. So work on a reward system with her, reward good behavior and take away stuff for not. Also remember she is a pre-teen girl and the defiance level is going to be high for a couple more years. Mine has acted like a teenager since she was 3 so I'm hoping she mellows out by then.","1417392064"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","A) it sounds like you avoid eating before going to sleep. that's a myth, don't avoid it. To be honest I cram down food before i go to bed because when you stuff yourself you get tired. People love to blame tryptophan for causing the after-dinner tiredness from tahnksgiving, but I'm a believer its because the food is so good people cram themselves way more than usual and that puts you in a hibernation mode (just like cold temperatures. look it up) and makes you sleepy.

I sleep awesome when I cram before bed, and I wake up hungry and looking for breakfast.

Also, whatever ""weightlifting"" you do at school I will bet my next paycheque it is garbage. Highschool gym teachers are 90% of time basically frauds, they have no idea what they are talking about. I have seem some down-right disgusting videos of coaches training highschool althetic teams.

At the end of the day the cold hard truth is: I'm an internet stranger and you have no way of verifying my integrity. I am a certified personal trainer but why should you believe or care about that? What you need to do is your own research, pay attention to the world reknowned coaches like Mark Rippetoe or Charles Poliquin, or you could listen to the champs themselves like Arnold and Ronnie Coleman, OR you could read shit from all of them and try and a bit of everything and see what works for you. The truth is, what works for me might not work for you. But I digress.

healthy breakfast: eggs, milk, toast, fruit. or swap fruit for bacon and milk for juice. AND, NOT OR. if you swap out fruit SWAP OUT MILK. You want carbs and protein. Fat will take care of itself if you aren't one of those low-fat dieters.

All of these comments are something along the lines of ""these people are annoying, they're hurting people who aren't even related to the cause."" The point of a protest is to get attention for your cause. A big demographic of people you're trying to reach are people who don't care either. Sure, a lot of people on the road might not have an opinion on the issue, but by blocking their route, the protesters are forcing these people to give the issue at hand some thought.

create a custom resolution = sending 4K to monitor and let it handle the downsampling (which limits you to 30Hz in most cases)

using DSR = let your nvidia graphics card downsample and filter the image so a normal resolution image is sent to the monitor, 

and three, the best option, if available, using something like BF4 res scale to render at a higher resolution. Reason why this is the best is because it will leave the HUD intact and only improve the game image.

"solotravel","t5_2rxxm","Heathrow is the busiest airport and as such you are likely to get better deals with it (more competition).  I have personally found flying mid week (tuesday in particular) the cheaper day to fly when I'm flying around europe, but it can vary depending on time of year.  If it's spring, watch out for bank holidays (https://www.gov.uk/bank-holidays).  I'd probably also more look at when the flight lands into heathrow.  Something that gets in monday morning will probably have the business crowd and be more expensive.  

As for waiting to book etc, its all a bit of a gamble really.  If you want to go and the price looks good, lock it in. 

If you want to do some flexible travel, then booking accommodation and hiring a car is a bit of a question mark.  I personally prefer to have accommodation booked for at least my first two nights (particularly when jet lag is involved).  The closer you get to summer, the busier it will be and harder to get accommodation on the fly.  But between b&amp;b's and airbnb you should be fine.  I find there seems to be two ends of this spectrum in last minute booking: the hotels are already busy so prices are really high, or they're just trying to fill some rooms so you get a great deal.  I guess it depends on your budget, dates and how well you handle having to change plans last minute :)

The rugby world cup is playing out in the UK in september, so if you delayed your trip that would make it very expensive. Consider those type of events too.

I have no tricks with rental cars unfortunately.  I avoid driving as much as possible and the UK trains have usually been quite convenient for me.  Have fun planning the trip :)","1417392073"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Posting my own comment as separate to the sources, in case someone disagrees with me. 

But basically Borbalán admitted to seeing Messi get hit. He then tries to justify his action by saying the bottle did not have a cap on and thus would have been somewhat empty meaning it didn't hurt. The image in the link clearly shows him throwing a bottle away with a cap on. The video from the incident also showed that there was water in the bottle. 

It's a farce really. Borbalán and Mess never really saw eye to eye but this is such a fantastically stupid incident. He's also the one who blew a free kick on Munir when he should have had a penalty vs Atleti.

Edit: Furthermore I read on twitter that it's illegal to bring water with caps on into the stadium. Makes sense in order to avoid incidents such as this one. Perhaps he was trying to cover for Valencia's security? Can anyone from Valencia confirm this rule?","1417392074"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","Technically, yes. A Force-wielder can use whatever color crystal they want in their lightsaber. There is nothing really stopping, say, a Jedi from putting a red lightsaber crystal in their weapon, but there are reason as to why they don't and why the Sith are largely seen using red crystals:

* Jedi favored naturally occurring crystals that came from planets like Illum and Dantooine. Most of these crystals were not red and were instead green, blue, yellow, purple, and many other different variants—with blue and green being the most abundant. By the time the Clone Wars started, most of the crystals found were only blue and green.

* The most common way to receive a red crystal was to manufacture one. Artificially created lightsaber crystals came out as red most of the time, but the crystal can be modified to any color with additional steps. Other changes can be made as well. The crystal can be further compressed to form a much tighter, more controllable blade with greater precision. It can also be made to be more unstable—creating a blade with crackling energy running along its length for more lethality, but with the drawback of being more prone to shorting out.

* Because the Jedi controlled most of the sites where naturally occurring crystals originated, the Sith have had to resort to manufacturing their own. When a Sith artificially creates a crystal, they imbue it with the Dark side of the Force—which further gives it its red hue.

* There have been times where Sith (recently turned from the Jedi) choose to keep using their old weapons rather than using a red-bladed variant. Darth Vader did this for a time when he recently fell. Exar Kun (and many of his followers) also did. One can speculate that this may have actually been a tactic to lure Jedi into a false sense of security—unaware of the Sith's true affiliations until it was too late.

* There has been a long standing tradition of Sith wielding synthetic, red lightsaber blades. The blood-like color of the blade when imbued with the Dark side—as well as its offensive properties—are speculated to be the key factors for continuing this tradition. The Jedi—not wanting to be affiliated with the Sith—have since disfavored the use of synthetic crystals and red-hued blades.","1417392075"

Not sure. Intel is supposed to be launching its new dual-core Broadwell U processors in [about a month](http://www.cpu-world.com/news_2014/2014100301_Intel_to_launch_Broadwell_U_series_CPUs_at_CES_event.html) and it sounds like there won't be Broadwell quad-core processors [until Q3 2015](http://www.cpu-world.com/news_2014/2014111601_Launch_schedule_of_Intel_mobile_CPUs.html). So perhaps that means there will be a new dual-core 13"" Macbook Pro in March/April 2015 and new quad-core 15"" Macbook Pros in October/November 2015.

Broadwell has a [better GPU](http://www.cpu-world.com/news_2014/2014050101_Intel_Broadwell_graphics_enhancements.html). There might also be new features added to the Macbook Pro line such as a touchscreen, which might actually be quite useful for mobile development and testing.","1417392075"

"podemos","t5_31h78","Para mí no. El nepotismo en las universidades está muy presente y es a veces más difícil de atajar de lo que parece, incluso en las universidades más prestigiosas hay algún caso de contratación irregular. 
¿Cómo se puede valorar imparcialmente una candidatura en situaciones normales (no en el caso de Errejón, que es claro enchufismo) en el caso de que uno de los profesores que valore tu candidatura para un puesto de investigador te conozca? Aunque se sepan las notas, publicaciones, calificaciones, trabajos externos, colaboraciones,etc., que se presentan y sobre todo en los departamentos de humanística puedes encontrarte con decenas de candidatos de perfiles parecidos, si el profesor que te evalúa conoce tu forma de trabajar y le gusta, es inevitable que te tenga un poco más de estima, que a un desconocido, somos humanos. 

Ojo que no quiero decir que lo de Errejón sea justificable, porque se trata de un caso de claro nepotismo, simplemente digo que la evaluación de un alumno o investigador en circunstancias de absoluta justicia (es decir en las que se tome en cuenta solo el expediente), en el caso de alguien que se conoce siempre es más problemática, y no es tan fácil ver el nepotismo. Si tuvieras dos licenciados o doctores con similares perfiles y supieras que uno es diligente con su trabajo, te arriesgarías a contratar a otro que a lo mejor te va a dar más problemas, es chapucero o inconsistente, solo para demostrar que no tienes tratos de favoritismo, es cierto que a veces se puede recurrir a una segunda y tercera opinión, pero en caso de especialidades muy específicas a lo mejor no tienes esa posibilidad, porque no hay profesores capaces de juzgar la calidad del trabajo presentado por el aspirante para el puesto. 

Sin embargo si te vas de vacaciones con tu novia/novio/querida/querido/mujer/marido/perro/geranio o similar a costa del pecunio público, es indudable que te estás malgastando el dinero público y abusando de la situación, es un claro ejemplo de corrupción.","1417392077"

Codes are constantly changing and evolving, and what met code in the 1950's isn't going to meet code today (usually), but you often don't have to upgrade to meet the newer code, depending on the jurisdiction and what's being done. And the ways to skirt code are many. For example, reusing some portion of an exterior stair when adding a deck, and just calling it a ""repair"".

That would depend on the usage of the building and usage. If it would be fire code and an public building you'd have to make changes if it for instance was a theater in regards to emergency exits and similar.","1417392078"

The i7 is overkill but once games start using multithreading more you'll need it. Anyhow, for $10 more you get:

- Faster ram, two sticks only for better dual-channel performance
- Way better SSD
- Better 970, this one has a backplate and cools really well
- This case has excellent airflow and cooling, you should be adding more fans to this case, also has a nice big window, check out a [review](http://www.tweaktown.com/reviews/6804/thermaltake-core-v51-mid-tower-chassis-review/index.html) of the case
- More PSU power incase you ever decide to SLI

There must be a name for this phenomenon."" to which Dawkins replied ""Well yeah, it's what we know as evolution by natural selection."" and the other guy went ""Oh, I don't believe in that"" and stopped talking to him!","1417392081"

No no no THIS IS SHOCKING ) shocking.
Like a continuous smack to the face.
We'd been watching in sickening silence for about 15 minutes, my mate was still on one knee after picking up the TV remote, I asked him to turn the volume on, it was horrible to hear voices confirming what we were seeing. Another overused word, horrific, now completely correctly used. It was horrific, cruel and brutal. I felt physically dizzy and sick. And then, I thought I was imagining it and the News commentator hadn't seen it yet, but I could see another plane. Another plane, and now I could hear someone repeating and getting louder 'fxxk off fxxk off FxxK OFF' and screaming it and it was me as the second plane hit and we all turned away like we'd been slapped.

If you experience no effects after 30 mins. to an hour, try a larger dose around 20 mg or so... work your way up until you feel effects, document what they are so you can research what you may have been sold, as appearance, dosage, and subjective effects can help you identify a substance online relatively fast.

"wow","t5_2qio8","I would definitely say KJC is the better of the three talents in its tier for Affliction PvP. Mannoroth's Fury doesn't do much good for Seed of Corruption and I prefer the mobility of KJC over the extra damage offered by Archimonde's Darkness. Typically, I use KJC when I'm taking a beating and need to get away from a melee or LoS a secondary target. Just cast KJC and drain life to heal on the move. 

With regards to GSac, I personally use GSup instead, but I've been considering GSac as an alternative. I rather like GSac + Demonic Servitude for flavour purposes (I play a warlock for a reason, y'know?), but it happens to be pretty effective in PvP too. The terrorguard has both a silence and a 4-second immobilize that can be cast on players at a distance, making the big guy pretty valuable. 

So, yes, I would say KJC is important for affliction PvP, but I think GSac is optional. ","1417392086"

We were at a park, and we were smoking a few joints that I had brought and a pipe was being passed around. I had been smoking more than I usually do that day, so I was pretty damn high. Almost uncomfortably high. 

Anyways, I see a cop car pull into the park, and immediately I started panicking because not only did some of the people that I was with have weed on them, but the guy who sells 25i was there with a good amount of harder drugs, and another guy had a decent amount of coke on him.  

Everyone seemed oblivious to the whole situation, and after a second of panicking I told everyone that I was out. I hopped on my bike and rode as fast as I could away from the park. 

Turns out it wasn't the cops, and it was just the Park Rangers there to fix something by the swimming pool. 

On my way home, I got chased by a guy who said if I didn't give him my bike he would fuck me up. This asshole chased my for 2 blocks before I lost him. After that I went to my grandmothers house which was empty and I rode out the panic.

The moral of the story is don't get uncomfortably high in public.  ","1417392088"

&gt;__Ellas Otha Bates__ (December 30, 1928 – June 2, 2008), known by his stage name __Bo Diddley__, was an American [R&amp;B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_blues) vocalist, guitarist and songwriter (usually as __Ellas McDaniel__). He was also known as __The Originator__ because of his key role in the transition from the [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues) to [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll), and [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music), influencing a host of acts, including [The Animals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Animals), [Buddy Holly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Holly), [Jimi Hendrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix), [The Rolling Stones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rolling_Stones), [Pink Floyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Floyd), [Parliament Funkadelic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Funkadelic), [The Velvet Underground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Velvet_Underground), [The Who](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Who), [The Yardbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yardbirds), [The Jesus and Mary Chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jesus_and_Mary_Chain), [Eric Clapton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Clapton),  [Elvis Presley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elvis_Presley),  and [The Beatles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles),  among others.  He introduced more insistent, driving rhythms and a hard-edged electric guitar sound on a wide-ranging catalog of songs, along with [African rhythms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Africa) and a signature beat (a simple five-[accent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accent_(music\)) [clave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clave_(rhythm\)) rhythm) that remains a cornerstone of [hip hop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music), [rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) and [pop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music).    Accordingly, he was inducted into the [Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_Roll_Hall_of_Fame) and received Lifetime Achievement Awards from the [Rhythm and Blues Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhythm_and_Blues_Foundation)   and a [Grammy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award) from the [National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academy_of_Recording_Arts_and_Sciences). He was known in particular for his technical innovations, including his trademark rectangular guitar.

I was trying to find where I said great, but anyway: As other people said it would require a well tought-out basic income system. I am no expert on the matter, but there are a lot of people that study this subject, I suggest you do your own research. People will be unemployed, and that will be OK. People will still have money and be able to live well without needing a job, but if they want they can work any job they like and get paid even more. Or choose not to work and do what they like with their life without constraints. Don't you think it would be better than the current system, if it worked properly?

Edit: Also I suggest you watch the [related CGP Grey video, it's a great watch. Even if it doesn't consider basic income.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU)

&gt; I've already shown that what you've presented does not accurately capture the opinions of that amorphous group ""who read it.""

No, you haven't.  All you have shown is the flimsy excuses you cling to in order to deny the evidence.  Your reasoning has already been shown to be faulty.  And your desperate ""I want to believe people who don't like things don't vote"" has no basis in fact.  

 
&gt; But even if it did (which it doesn't), being ""popular"" is not the same thing as being ""good.""

*Good (adjective): 1) Being desired or approved of.  2) having the qualities required for a particular role.*

Appealing to a vast percentage of the target audience does, in fact, mean it is good.  It's the principle of customer satisfaction.

Melting gels and creamy cleansers are generally both gentle, the type of surfactants/ emusifiers they have are quite weak so poor at dislodging structural lipids.

Hopefully you are using the extra sensitive head on your Clarisonic and not using chemical exfoliants too often. The more of the protective surface 'dead' layer - actually highly active tissue - you remove the more you risk dehydration, irritation and breakouts.

Certain ingredients are able to penetrate the skin from a cleanser or rinse off product, you could take advantage of this with the time you are 'pushing' ingredients at your skin with the vibrations of the Clarisonic.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Oil being cheap is, itself, usually a good thing for the economy as a whole (but bad for the oil companies).  The problem is that usually a decrease in oil price is a reaction to other unrelated bad economic news.  That's a bad thing.  The current oil prices are due mostly to an economic slowdown in asia (which could turn into another global recession), mixed with significantly higher US supply of oil due to fracking (and to a lesser degree increase in oil from oil sand out of Canada).  

Recently OPEC, lead by Saudi Arabia, declined to cut supplies to keep oil prices high, because they feel that they can hurt the US oil boom by keeping oil prices low.  They can do this because fracking and extracting oil for oil sands is expensive, so it only makes sense to do so if oil prices are high.  Oil extracted in Saudia Arabia is much cheaper, so they can sell oil at a lower cost and still make a significant profit.  To some degree it's delaying the inevitable, because there is a massive amount of oil in the US and Canada trapped in shale/oil sands that will eventually radically change the world oil production balance.  So this ""oil war"" could be bad depending on how it hashes out.","1417392100"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Nice rant.

If someone has the attitude that they would never have sex with someone they do not love, then they are off-limits by default. They can stay out all night with friends of the opposite sex without need for worry or jealousy. If they were ever to cheat on you it's firstly because they love someone else and only secondly because they are a cheating scumbag. Their exes and the drama that comes with them will be few and far between.

That, IMO, is a good trait, and people without that trait are morally inferior. You can call this view regressive and ignorant if you like, but in general taking short term pleasure at the expense of long term gains is foolish.

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","In my personal opinion, I have nothing against immigrants. But the third largest political party (Sverigedemokraterna) are ""immigration critical"". The problem isn't that they are criticizing immigration, because they way the immigration system has been for the past 20 years is really awful. The problem is that it's a political party filled with racists. The party has it's roots in neo nazism and barely a week passes without some nutjob saying something racist in public. Overall, it completely depends on where you arrive. Especially about muslims.

The city I live in (and especially the part of the city that I live in) has quite many immigrants, but I don't mind. I like the diversity in my part of the town. I think we have like 200 different nationalities represented here or something.

Overall, Sweden is a liberal country when it comes a lot of things, when it comes to immigration as well. We do nee to fix up the way we treat newly coming people, though.","1417392110"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Maybe It was just good timing for me. I think my favorite part was my drunken adventure with 2 birds and a midget. 

I was in Killarney strolling the nightlife with my stepbrother when we ran into 4 local gals one was a midget. With a cigar in one hand and a bottle of Jamenson in the other I was truly taking in the Irish culture of street music and laughing with the local cops how I'd be arrested in the US right now. 

As things died down and streets grew quiet with that spinning drunken enjoyment one of the girls mentioned a techno club just beyond the other town. With no cash or car we staggered down the moonlight roads along the old stone walls stopping for the occasional piss, a cherished tradition I'm sure. 

We laughed and with the georgous midget held my shoulder I persistently added I'm just having fun as I love my girlfriend back home. After a hour this techno club was quickly exceeding the distance I could manage. The girls were tired while my stepbrother and I surrendered all sense of direction. 

Somewhere between my stepbrother vomiting and one of the girls looking at her phone we found ourselves in the empty countryside alone. Where had the girls gone? My once heavy with joy bottle had become light with the last drop. 

We decided the night had ended but where is the hotel let alone the fine town of Killarney? The fresh scent of pete filled the air as we ventured unsure of the winding roads. 

Not lost but certainly unsure of where to continue our travels I crouched down aside a stone wall to gather my inebriation. At this point my stepbrother seemed to have found himself along with the realization the girls had gone, liquor depleted, and any hope of a foreign shag quickly dwindling. As I laid my head against the cool moss covered stone he recanted the urgency to either find this elusive techno club or a means to our reserved beds. 

Alas headlights glistened across the hillside. We waved the driver down and explained our desperate situation of no girls, no whiskey, and the unfortunate misplacement of ourselves. The fragrance of good weed and Metallica echoed from the car. Our dedicated embrace of local culture proved fruitful as we climbed into the cramped car with 3 guys and a girl. They generously shared a joint and tolerated our poor perception of direction landing us upon our hotel.

I was arguing against the logic that because Marx's work isn't scientific, he cannot be classified as an economist (the implication being economics is a science and Marxism isn't). I hence inverted that to say that in fact Marx was an economists and quite possible scientific, however for that to be consistent we must understand 'economics' in Marx's time was very different to how it is today.","1417392112"

"LGBTeens","t5_2t8gr","Well, where in Brazil do you live? 

Depending on where you live I don't think coming out publicly. Maybe to your friends only (as opposed to FB friends), specially depending on the school you go (I'm assuming it's a private one, but even if it is, some schools aren't the nicest regarding that).

Without knowing more info I can't give better advice, but in general, I think you should think a lot about it. 

I wasn't out during HS but I had other people on my class/school that were and it was ok, but I had the luck to go to a school where the people were fine with everything, and it helped since the classes were divided by grade, and ""nerds"" aren't the most judgemental group.

But I've heard first hand stories of cases where it didn't go so well, leading to bullying/assault. And all this in São Paulo and in upper class private schools, which should in theory be more progressive than the other cities/schools.

All in all it's a decision you need to make on your own, but don't do it on a whim, because it will affect you (positively and negatively) on the long term, and it's something you can't undo.  My recomendation, without knowing more specifics is: don't do it unless you really feel you need to, and even then just to friends, acquaintances (though there will be rumours) don't need to know that.

Anyways, good luck with highschool.

You could argue ""they're in the public eye"" (because they are) but don't confuse that with being a representative. Also, I think that they acted and dressed precisely age appropriate. Teenagers are idiots, even the smart ones are dumb in terms of how they portray themselves simply because they don't have the life experience. 
You should also try and look at things from their point of view. Being a regular teenager is difficult enough with hormones and trying to define yourself, but now imagine that you're constantly in your father's shadow. No one refers to you by your name but rather by ""Oh, you're the presidents daughter."" So of course during some speech that is a rather stupid ""tradition"" (it's only been going on since 1947 so in terms of government not that long) they're going to be less than enthusiastic, especially when their father tries his hand at humor and fails. Perhaps you and Elizabeth Lauten should try empathy before wanting to jam your opinion down other peoples throats. ","1417392116"

1. Grab a Greek: Chicken Souvlaki Platter. Comes with a Mediterranean type salad (I think the salad is great), potatoes, rice, a pita with tzatziki and a souvlaki skewer (~$10). If I don't feel like eating a whole platter I usually get the Chicken Souvlaki wrap (~$6).

2. China Legend: Hakka Chili Chicken Combo Plate. Not authentic Hakka but I think it is pretty great. I usually get the combo plate and divide the thing over 2 meals (or one and just skip dinner lol). The combo plate comes with a bowl of hot and sour soup, fried rice and a spring roll (~$11).

3. Al Madina: Chicken Shawarma. It doesn't taste as good as Mozy's but it is still great for sure. I fill it with as much veggies and beans as possible and its a filler for sure (~$8). I also have heard very good things about their ""Shawarma Poutine"".

4. Burger King: Mostly anything on the daily deals menu they've got when I'm feeling cheap (~$3). I go to Harvey's if I'm feeling like getting a better looking burger for a buck or two more.

5. The Grill: I usually go there on Fridays if ever for their Fish and Chips deal (~$7 with a drink). If not fish and chips then I think their poutine is pretty great and quite filling (~$7).

Both would still be limited to the 3D settings I've configured on my television - the display device is still going to control the actual picture, not the player. All the player does is send the uncompressed signal over HDMI to your TV (perhaps through the receiver, but receivers just let 3D pass through). It's also worth noting that most BR disks are not designed for maximum ""pop"" affect - since the ""pop"" is considered gimmicky by many people. The TV should feel like a window that you look into and has a ""deep"" picture. That's the case with most br disks, anyways. Some movies that are well known for having good pop out effects are RE: Afterlife, IMAX Under the Sea, Journey to the Center of the Earth, and Hansel and Gretel.  
If you are saying there is no 3D affect at all, though, that's something else. Can you confirm that you've enabled the 3D option in the display settings?","1417392120"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I just had a two year career break, and whilst it wasn't for the purpose of fitness and weight loss, that became a big part of it. Mainly out of boredom really.

I was successful in my goals and a few more besides, so I'll offer what advice I can.

* Cook for yourself and calculate calories and macros so you make informed decisions. Once you can prepare interesting tasty foods within your calorie target, you've won the war. Buy kitchen and bathroom scales if you don't have them already.

* Plan long term strategic goals, but achieve them through short term targets. Don't just think 'I want to be x weight by the end of my career break'. For one, you may realise that goal was short sighted or even not ambitious enough. For another, you sell yourself short. Be realistic, but also aim for what you really want. Then work out a pathway to get there in a planned and manageable way. (hint: this will almost without exception involve strict diet control and weight lifting if your goals.involve body image and self esteem!)

* Plan your activities week by week and just do them. Sunday was a rest day for me, and I used Sunday to plan the following week. Come Thursday, if I had a morning weight session and an afternoon swim planned, I just did them. No excuses.

* Combine strength training with cardio. Personally I started with P90x and if you have trouble programming stuff I'd highly recommend it. It stops gym membership or programming being a  barrier. Put the video on and follow along. Simple. I combined that with swimming and working on form for Barbell lifting. Once P90x was done (and I'd lost 25lbs) I picked up Barbell training with canditos linear strength programme. Weight training gives you physique, diet and cardio lose weight and that also helps your self esteem.

* Work out at home as much as possible. I had a gym in my garage. It's just impossible to avoid that way. Without work, it's too easy for getting dressed, shaving and getting to the gym to be a barrier. Remove that barrier. Workout in your pyjamas...

* Keep occupied. With only a couple of hours working out and an hours food prep, there is still a lot of the day to fill. Visit libraries, galleries, learn to code, do online courses, take up hiking or photography. Just do something engaging for your brain to stop fitness becoming an all emcompassing obsession and to stop you thinking about food. Fitness is by its nature a self obsessed endeavour. I found it useful to retain perspective. Socialising is also important. Without work we tend not to interact with many people unless we make the effort to.

* Make every day count. A career break can feel like you have all the time in the world, but it will be over all too soon. My only regret is it took me one of my two years off to decide to make fitness my priority. I could be a year further down the line by now! No zero days, no laziness , structure your time and PUT THE WORK IN. Out of bed by seven, Fed by eight, and working out/being constructive. Note that rest days are a vital part of a fitness regime however. Yo Ivan always swim, yoga or stretch on rest days if you need some activity scheduled in them. You have a purpose, so achieve it.

Good luck. Read the wiki, focus on diet and calorie control, and lift weights and you'll be amazed what you can achieve with a focussed mind set.","1417392120"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I wanted another because for me, I've loved having a brother. We never fought much, we're good friends as adults, and I love my nieces. I know you can't guarantee that there'll be a good relationship, but I guess I wanted to give my kid that possibility, and also take the pressure off a bit. Being the only child must be a bit demanding at times, I'm sure. 

Aside from my daughter, I wanted another because it's been so much fun having my girl. I'd love some more of the same. Unfortunately I just miscarried, and, as I'm 38, I don't know if we'll end up with any more. There are benefits, certainly. It's easy to move around with one child. Easy to have 'me' time and keep the house clean and so on. I guess it's a difficult decision.

"trapproduction","t5_2wdcv","Take this with a grain of salt, I've only been producing for a year.

One of the ways I design my 808 from a massive sine wave or simple 808 is I like to smash it super hard into a limiter, compress, saturate, split into 3 frequency range - Sub/Mid/Highs. Thicken up the mids/highs. By the time I'm down processing my 808 it won't have a tail. Should be just a hard ass bassline at this point, then I like to freeze+flatten my tracks and use fades for custom tails and length of the notes.

If I still feel my 808's aren't right I'll put the finished 808 into a instrument rack and duplicate it 3 more times, again eq accordingly and glue compress them for a final sound.
If I feel at the end anything is to buzzy or distorted I'll use multiband compression to tame the frequencies I don't like and boost the ones I do.

I also noticed you talking about if you compress louder your sub distorts, make sure you turn down the 808 volume before you do all the processing so when you're finished, it's compressed and limited hard but at a lower volume so it's not clipping. This brings out all those harmonics and power from the processing while keeping the ""sound"" at the same volume level.

But most importantly, volume! 
Try turning all your sounds down minus your kick and 808 by -6db and turning your computer/laptop monitor up by that amount. Now your kick/808 is 6db louder than the other sounds and should be a good starting point.","1417392128"

Many people enjoy this game because of its competitive aspect, and talking trash is one of the most fun and creative ways players have to express their competitive drive. I understand that you may not like what some players say to you, but there are many options you can employ to ensure that you don't have to see what strangers want to say to you (you can mute players, set your chat channel to private, etc). If you are offended by what some idiot says online it is your fault, you could ignore him just as easily as you can mute him. Most players enjoy trash talk, as evidenced by the massive amounts of players who bm, and you should not enforce your preferences onto other players just because you don't enjoy it. ","1417392129"

1. Go to the Battlefield folder

2. Copy the whole Battlefield folder some place else as a backup

3. Uninstall BF from Origin

4. Start downloading it again via Origin

5. Stop the download

6. Copy/move the backup (made in step 2) back to the installation directory

The trick with monitors is learning how they represent music. If you're producing on hifi speakers you have to compensate for it, on monitors its a bit different.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","3 minutes is too low. When I'm on a dummy I tend to oom around the 4:15 mark. Things you can do (apologies for the long post):

* Fit two off-GCD abilities in between GCDs. For example, Spur and Rouse are both short enough that they can fit in between GCDs. 
* Use the natural off-GCD time you get during your normal rotation. For example, you expect to cast Bio about 3 times every minute. That's 3 ""free"" opportunities to use off-GCD abilities. If there's any forced movement you're expecting where a Ruin II will be used, that's +1 per.
* Drop Miasma II completely from the rotation after the opener. Why? See below.

The SMN class, like many classes, does not have a set rotation, so it uses Potency per GCD to create a priority system. When fights get longer and your MP is constrained, you have to consider not only potency per GCD, but MP per Potency. You can do a cost-benefit analysis of your different options:

* Base MP per potency is Ruin, your filler. Ruin is 80 potency and costs 79 MP, so you're at almost exactly a 1:1 ratio.
* Using Ruin II instead of nothing at all (relevant when there is forced movement) costs you 133 MP and gains you 80 potency. MpP is 1.6625:1.
* Using Miasma II instead of Ruin I costs you 107 MP. Contagion'd Miasma II gains you 40 potency. MpP is 2.675:1.
* Using Ruin II instead of Ruin I costs you 54 MP. Using an off-GCD ability off the GCD gain you ~16 potency. (Off-GCD abilities take about 0.5 seconds and that is 0.5 seconds lost on Ruin cast time. 0.5 seconds is 1/5 of an 80 potency Ruin, so 80/5 = 16.) MpP is 3.375:1.

So based on these, you see the worst return for your MP is using Ruin II to activate an empty off-GCD for you to use your off-GCD stuff. Next worst is using Miasma II in your priority system. If your MP is suffering, you should first drop out off-GCD activating Ruin II and then Miasma II.

What about using Ruin II when you're forced to move? Does that mean you should drop it out and do nothing? 

* Using ED instead of Fester costs you 150 potency and gains you 266 MP. 266 MP is exactly 2 Ruin IIs, which makes it easy to see that using 2 Ruin IIs during forced movement (160 potency total) is a 10 potency gain in the long run.

Is there anything else you can do to save on MP and help your DPS? YES. 

Any BLM will tell you that the #1 key to his DPS is maximizing the efficiency of their movement. Knowing the fight (when and where movement is required) and, where possible, moving only when there is no penalty (e.g. during procs, after fast B3 or F3, moving shortly before casts are done so the cast still goes off).

SMNs are no different. They doesn't lose damage directly like BLMs, but they lose MP when they rely on Ruin II to compensate for their lack of planning, and that directly results in a loss of DPS (having to use ED to stay MP neutral). 

Last but not least, your Bard is not there to be an MP beacon solely for you. If the healers are asking for mana, then he will have to play mana song and your MP problems are mostly out the window. But if they do not, his MP is better used on Foe's or TP song if the melee/tanks/bard need it. Even if TP song is not needed, the bard is suffering a 20% damage loss strictly for your inefficiency, and you are losing damage from not having Foe's.

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","To add to that, I think it really helps to know what kind of images connect easily and what has to match in complicated and precise ways.

This way, you have more leeway in the cut to make it work. Otherwise you have two shots of him going from room a to room b and the dialogue might be uncuttable or have weird timing.

I am assuming that you have experience with shooting as well as editing your own footage? Thats something you just learn over time and get better at. Like photonoobie said, it is key to have a vision of what each shot looks like and if you have a good imagination, then it should play in your head without any jarring cuts. Also you should make out the scenes which might cause problems and continue working on them or just simplifying them.","1417392135"

1. Everyone did exceptionally well academically.  4.0 gpa's, some are published...etc, this is a given.

2. Something has to set you apart.  12 people have a 4.0 applying for the same job why will they pick you?  Are you a woman that speaks a foreign language, ex-military, lived in a foreign country for most of your life, college adviser is a recognized expert?  Something.  Is this unfair, yes.  However, these companies would rather train up an Asian woman that knows Chinese than another American guy as they are trying to make inroads into Asia and need a technical staff that knows the customs and language. 

3. Don't be fat. No, they don't make you stand on a scale, but you have to interview with dozens of others for a limited number of jobs all with similar backgrounds/schooling.

You will have a tough time because majors like to hire from intern pools, unless you can get in as an experienced hire based on your minerals experience?

&gt; * If the police think that you have committed a minor offence and you tell them who you are, then, instead of arresting you, they could give you a paper telling you when to go to court.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Because while I get nothing from an atheist, I get a great deal from other ideas I hold that are in direct conflict with theism.

Egalitarianism, for instance, is the basis of my moral philosophy; the belief that all humans are in principle created equal is the cornerstone of my ethics. As soon as I allow for even one supernatural being in human form, the door is immediately open for all of them. Tell me, if a person believes Jesus was in some respect divine and had a direct line to god, or Moses, then why not David Koresh or Andrea Yates? Another example is, I think I mentioned in this conversation already, my feeling that moral responsibility is nontransferable, which is the basis for pretty much all of Christianity—putting the sins of humankind on Jesus is the whole deal.

Besides morality, there's the philosophical pursuit of truth. I hold as good ideas many of the tenets of science and reason: rationality, the importance of empirical evidence, etc. All of that goes right out the window with religion, the moment revealed wisdom is accepted all of these must be diminished. Note that I don't think any of this automatically qualifies my approach as somehow better than anyone else's at this point in the discussion, but I always find that it is useful to simply establish up front the truth as a worthy goal, at least.

Many, many times after skipping this step and explaining why rationality is more useful for pursuing the truth, I get, ""But why is all else subservient to truth? What's so great about knowing about objective reality if my beliefs make me feel good?"" (at which point I facepalm).","1417392143"

The Sun and the Mail (scratch that, most nationals )are dominated by Oxbridge alumni, just hating the krauts and liking a pint won't get you far at all.

In my book, you've got to be far cleverer to work for The Sun than you do The New York Times. It's one thing having a first-class Oxford degree in English and writing in a way that reflects that, another entirely to have it and write articles that appeal to the white van man.

At the point where you left it was basically okay - outside of a micro miracle I don't think you could come back. Other things to note:

- Scouting. You really, really need to confirm wether your opponent expanded or not. Ideally whether he has a barracks on top of the ramp. That's basically the way you decide at what point you need to stop droning. Also you can spot that left-hand side easily with an OL over the high ground, that's a pretty standard OL spot on this map.
- I don't agree with you moving your spines and lings forward. You denied the bunker, you're basically safe. Time is on your side, so you can afford the luxury to wait for a fight on creep. Just stop making drones at a safe amount (see above) and amass lings and queens. He's completely all-in - when he expands or moves back, you just break the contain. When he moves in too far, you crush him.
- Don't tech to roaches. In this case, either ling speed (no more marine stutter stepping) or banes would have put a clock on the contain. Personally I would suggest speed - once you break the contain this allows you to hunt down all the remaining army, basically securing the win.

My device had shut down even in 20% lol and the battery has 80 of its life. 

My advice is to do the full cycle charge, track it with battery life (don't know if it tracks well the battery's percentage in iPods).

If your battery runs well and works for your daily usually (not properly that it resist hard usage trough the day, which device does?) your battery isn't dead or dying (well practically it is dying always).

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I've had objectives for two years.  As Lon-ami said above, I do feel like I've done everything.. besides the over-the-top WvW achievements, spvp (because it's not my thing.. never has been in any game) and the pointless collections (I see them for what they are: busywork to distract from significant content additions and a massive gold drain for the economy).  I've already farmed dungeons over and over, done max level fractals over and over, I've already gotten two legendaries (and have the gold to finish two more.)  It's great that you're okay with what you have at the moment, but some of us have been there and done that.

I think the largest problem I have is all objectives seem the same in GW2: grind money to buy x off the TP.  I tire of it.. I've been tired of it.  Give us some more challenging instanced content in which we earn stuff directly.  Something that shows we can do more than faceroll our way through the same 2 year old dungeons and accumulate money.  I know it's subjective though.  Some people are okay with grinding money to buy things and others would rather earn their stuff directly and not pay others.  I wish there was a better balance between these two playstyles in GW2.

I still somehow love the game... I love Tyria, I love the lore, and I love the combat.  I just wish ANet would give us expansion worthy content already.","1417392151"

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt;Fighting for your country is not ""beta"". It's not weak.

Here are the words of Marine Core major general Smedley Butler; winner of two Medal of Honors:

[""War is a racket...  No one mentioned to them that their going and their dying would mean huge war profits""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3_EXqJ8f-0); it's dramatized, but they're all quotes from his book.


&gt;Fighting for your country is not ""beta""

Soldiers do not fight for their country; they fight for their government's interests. Who makes up the government? Wealthy politicians, the corporations than fund their elections, and the corporations interests.

&gt;Give your vets respect. They've earned it.

No they really haven't. Since WWII, Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, and Iraq have been nothing, but wastes of money.

It sucks that they were dumb enough to go overseas and get crippled, but that doesn't make the wars or their actions anything worthwhile.

&gt;Unquestionably so

Similarly have U.S. actions in the middle east made the world safer? This is an opinion, but our wars have only fueled terrorism and general anger at the U.S.

Obviously some are worse than others, but there's pretty much always the chance that some people won't tolerate a drug (or certain kinds of drugs). But most of them work (to some extent). I mean, drugs can be pretty fucking complex, especially if someone's got a health problem, which is usually why they need them in the first place.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","&gt;Because diversity = black. 

And this is why I say that all ""social justice"" movement in America is reek with hypocrisy. Diversity happens to mean a different thing in English. At least in the English we speak over here....

&gt;I didn't know someone could be improperly black. What's your definition of a proper black African and why do you think it's the best definition?

Considering that blacks in America are slightly over 10% of population (40m) while it is an overwhelming majority of African population with exceptions in the Maghreb area I'd say if you say ""black people"" I tend to immediately think ""Africa"" and not ""African-Americans"". That's a degree of self-centered obsession that's typical to Americans, especially to an European.

&gt;Why not? If an Asian actor tries out for a part and has the best acting chops for it, I don't see any reason NOT to. In the past, Hollywood cast white actors in most roles because that's who their white audiences best identified with. I think we live in a day and age now where audiences don't have any problems identifying with characters of different races on screen. 

But somehow black actors are fine whether white audiences identify with them or not? Because that's going to be 90% of the reason why white people in the theater will most likely feel ambiguous about a black lead character.  Ooooh.....but racism!  You can't say that about a black person!
Asian people in the IT industry in tv and film? Fuck it! Oh they're dominant? Fuck it in particular! But don't you dare *not* show a woman or a black as a scientist!

The hypocrisy of American SJWs is astounding. 

&gt;Literally no idea what you're talking about. Is that the shirtgate dude? 

Yup. Almost all of the traffic with vicious negative commentary came from America. Most of the most critical articles in the media were from American press. If it wasn't for American SJW assholes nobody would realize it was somehow ""bad"" in Europe. ","1417392158"

"Cyberpunk","t5_2qi50","So, I think the biggest part of making a successful wearable device is by really drilling down and analyzing what information people prioritize. What do we need it to do, and what functionality can we ignore as extraneous? 

I think wrist-based is probably the way to go. It's the location which is the least likely to interfere with regular activity; driving, typing, eating, etc... The [Microsoft Band](http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-band/en-us) which was recently released seems to get a lot of stuff right. It's small and relatively inconspicuous. The interface is simple and intuitive. I say all this because I've seen one in action. A coworker wears one daily.

The fact is, some activities need a decent sized screen, and smart phones have proven their utility. Small wearables excel in things like GPS and bio/health monitoring. I'd like to see some sort of pairing, like my phone won't work unless my wearable is within a certain range. A proximity alarm might be a cool safety feature, like if someone else got within a certain range. I'd like my wearable to control my phone directly. Things like camera activation, wifi detection and connection, voice recording. That sort of thing would get me toward purchasing.","1417392159"

Hope your Turkey Day (or Tofurky Day for the turkey-snugglers) was filled with warm memories shared by friends and family :) As of Friday, all of us at the lab were relaxed, recharged, full, and ready to conquer the holiday massacre that was Black Friday. Well, as of Sunday, we are looking like we are set to send out all of our packages by Monday evening; what a massive turnaround from last year! Definitely did not predict that our production/packaging lines would be able to clear through this many orders! (Guess the sour feeling of death and despair from managing the orders from last Black Friday with minimal infrastructure still lingers on our tongues). Nonetheless, we thought doing an entire weekend sale like last time would be murder on a stick, but the cortisol levels are low and we are working smart!

We also had a bunch of comments giving us hate for not discounting some nicotine base :? Oh nooooooooo, you guys are making us cave in. Peer pressure is a force to be reckoned with.... and we caved in. Enjoy &lt;3

Simply put a note in your order comments on the address to which the kit should be sent (if there are other items in your cart meant for yourself), along with any message you would like us to inscribe on an enclosed little holiday card. &lt;3

"sto","t5_2rfq3","You already got a Epic beam.. thats to much of an investment for 1 month playtime not even lvl 60.

Weapons give little dmg boost at epic mk xiv but the cost is high.
Best dmg for your money is at very rare mk xiv (xiii to xiv is the big dmg jump).

I wouldnt upgrade and spend alot of ec when you are not sure yet.
Actually upgrading is not really needed. If you do fine with very rare mk xii and you like you ship/captatin/build, then you can go and upgrade.

You need to decide (not now) what you want to do with you ship/captain

- exotic dps
- beam dps
- cannon dps
- kinetic dps
- single target
- multi target
- burst dmg
- tank (not really needed)

"custommagic","t5_2sbcz","One thing to note is that one-shot life gain cards like desperate light often aren't worth playing.

To understand this, you have to think about cards in your hand as a resource like life or mana. One mana for two life might see efficient mana wise, but now you have one less card in your hand than the opponent. Chances are, that extra card is going to be a lot more valuable in removing your defences or gaining board presence than the 2 life is in delaying your opponent. Even when we look at cards that straight up gain 7-8 life, that life does nothing but delay your opponent as he uses his greater pool of cards to build a better board than you.

Obviously this is an simplification of a fairly complicated concept, and there are situations where life-gain is very powerful. Please note that this concept doesn't apply as much to cards that gain life consistently over time, or cards that do other things besides gain life
(Even just being a creature is enough). However, you should always be wary of spells that do *nothing* but gain life. ","1417392161"

"rugbyunion","t5_2qkbe","It's definitely been happening for years in rugby. Around the mid-2000s there was a massive jump in the sizes of players; obviously some of that can be attributed to increased professionalism and more understanding of nutrition etc. but there has to be more to it than just taking a protein shake or 2 a day!

I think a lot of it is down to a lack of education on young people's part and, as it says in the article, a pressure from coaches to be bigger and bigger to compete. From the ages of about 15 lads are taking the likes of creatine and, from there, it just comes as part of the routine of training to be taking more supplements. If coaches are supplying/advising, these young lads are going to be trusting that it's in their interests and that adults aren't giving them something illegal/bad for their health. Therefore they're just taking things without thinking about it or reading into it too much and it's 'normal'.

Anecdotally, I know a lad who plays rugby to a fairly high standard. He'd be telling me about some of the stuff they'd be taking and it's basically just stretching the limits of the law and ordering things online that they can just about get away with. But, at university level, there doesn't seem to be drug tests anyway, at least in the UK.

It's also briefly touched on in the article, but us fans have to ask how much do we care? Do we want to address the use of steroids at the risk of a lesser spectacle? Rugby is a bit more 'bash straight down the middle' these days and there was a bit more skill in some elements in the past. But the stamina, endurance and pace is so much higher these days and that does produce a better viewing experience, especially later in matches and in packed schedules. 

I'm not sure what way I feel about this or how much I want to think about it.","1417392162"

nothing about softening your fabric.
They cant call them static cling sheets because no one would buy them. everyone like you wrongly assumes they soften your clothes, but if you read the fine print it always says when used with fabric softener (liquid)

My dad eventually got around to looking what was up. Turned out, there was a very dead, very decaying pigeon floating in our tank. By the looks of it, it'd been in there a week+. So, for a little more than a week, we were washing ourselves - and our hands - in dead pigeon water.

To explain how this happened, our loft is fucking terrible and has holes in the roof to the outside everywhere. The water tank had a stone lid on it, but had a little hole in the corner where it was broken. Pigeon probably popped in for a drink and, being a pigeon, couldn't get out again, and died.","1417392164"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Ironically it was unlimited data that fucked American mobile data from the start. 

Imagine you're a telco and the first iPhone just launched. We're talking pre-netflix, pre youtube, pre mobile Internet Google / android anything.... 

Well you charge people to use data. Take a good chunk as profit, invest the rest in having a better service than the next guy. 

Except one day someone comes out with an unlimited plan. If you don't match him, you'll loose all your customers. As the years go on you slowly realise that mobile data is skyrocketing however every year your investors want better returns on their money (or you're fired) so where do you get the cash? Well in this epic cluster fuck (technically called a race-to-the-bottom) you pull as much fucking funding as you can from the network and the service. 

You put all your efforts on phone subsidises so that your customers are locked in tight as shit for another two year every time an iPhone releases. And 4G? Yeah we'll upgrade our towers to 4G but you better hope no one else is online because the backhaul that actually powers those towers hasn't and won't be upgraded for years. 

So yeah, bitch about the cost of mobile Internet if you want, but the reality is your service can be good, cheap, or fast - but not all 3 at the same time. 

Fast cheap service won't be good. Good service cheap won't be fast. And fast, good service like NZ gets sure as fuck won't be cheap.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Let me tell you the problem with the sequels.

A. No tension.

The great thing about the first one is Fear Of Agents. It's the driver for so much. Whenever they enter the Matrix that tension is there. It's even there before you know what an Agent is (when they pick Neo up in the car and remove the bug). 

Now Neo is The One and can take on Agents where is the tension?

Nowhere, that's where.

B. Ridiculous ""stuff""

They just introduce a bunch of stuff that's ridiculous and ott. The first one is great because it's grounded in reality - people can die, jumping great distances off buildings is special and amazing still. 

In the sequels it's just bonkers. Fight 10 men? Okay. Fight 100 men? Okay. Fight in slow motion up and down some stairs so it looks like a choreographed dance with no damn tension? Ok. Introduce a bunch of characters with special powers just to look cool but without giving us a proper framework with which to assess nor appreciate the threat they pose (especially given Neo is The One now)? Ok.

The short answer is; they're just nowhere near as tightly plotted or planned. A real mess all in all. The second is watchable. The third is the Phantom Menace of the Matrix series - it ruins them all. 

Highlander 2 is the only sequel worse than The Matrix Revolutions. ","1417392168"

Of course I don't have any authority on the issue, but I'd imagine that fixing a FM is probably easier than adding a new plane from scratch.

you take their statements as fact and accept whatever they say on face value huh?

&gt;You should also take a look at Nasrallahs current speeches. Hezbollah has been working hard at attempting to remove any sectarian tensions in Lebanon and to keep the peace.

Hes simply doing what he needs to do to survive at this point. Kind of like Khomeini during exile attempting to gain as much support and acceptance as possible. He would say that we are all iranians, even communists deserve a say blah blah.
He collaborated with all different parties to gain power in iran. but once he took over that all changed.

People become addicts and get desperate which cause them to do anything they can to get their fix armed robbery or even murder. People need to stop using drugs and deal with their life problems like adults not try to be high and ignore them.

&gt;  It feels all wrong, but doesn't mean we can't still enjoy them!

The ""wrong"" feeling will pass with time. Realising that there is no one single right way to celebrate any holiday is a mental hurdle. Two of my in-law have dual US-Canada citizenship and they have some *weird* Christmas traditions like deep-frying the turkey - I guess that's more of an American tradition since they need to do that outside for safety reasons and it's usually too cold on Christmas day in Canada for that. My wife's immediate family's tradition is to pack up all the gifts on Christmas and take them to grandma's house. For me, that's always felt wrong since in my family I'd wake up my parents at 5am and open the gifts before breakfast.

You can still tell my smile is slightly uneven and one eye has a slightly heavier lid, but you'd not notice if you weren't looking for it), but it wasn't the horror people think it is.

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I think the loudest messages are silent.  What you're wearing, not saying anything, posture, just a general anti-social vibe will create a safe zone around a male into which no socialized female will enter.  It's pretty obvious if you're not making your intent known or making some mark on a social gathering that you will be cast aside in a female's mind.

If you just reverse those non-verbal queues, well-dressed, gregarious, and excellent body language (i.e. posture, take up space, occupy places in the room or seating that forces people to look at you) are going to get you + points in a room from both males and females, unless you have some type of negative history with them.

I've never been approached by a female when I've acted the beta way, and that was more or less what I'd been doing the first 22 years of my life.  If I wasn't good looking, I wouldn't have had any relationships outside of friends and family with which to guide my understanding.

I can only use an example of neutral signals from a gathering to watch football last night (2 other males, 1 female and her boyfriend, and me).  We were watching Alabama and Auburn, and I can follow football, but it's not really my thing anymore, so I didn't contribute.  Kept active on my phone (passive social ID that I wasn't just completely shut off from social contact).  Appropriate reactions to the game and good plays.  The only time I really showed any flare was when a racial comment was made about how Hitler was trying to make a master race and all these football players would have been what he had in mind.  I made the comment that it's popularly referenced in history how ironic it was that the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin were at a time when Hitler wanted to show the world his master race, and we showed up with athletes (who happened to be black) who just mopped up, and it was because we accidentally did what he had planned to do all along through slavery.  It got solid laughs from half the room, but the couple looked like they didn't know what to think, probably because they had never heard me speak until that point; the other two had hung out with me and I had good rapport.

It always depends on the situation.  Your social awareness will dictate how affective you can be in a room every time.  You can't make a one-size-fits-all list of how to appeal to women, but the few that I listed are great way to amplify the affect prudent comments and conversation have on a room; all things in tandem will determine the impressions people have of you.","1417392175"

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","I guess precise may be the wrong word. I just meant melee and project M were a lot more technical. L-cancels and wave dashing shananigans that sped up the game quite a bit. Makes for fast paced action with a high skill cap, though it also creates quite a divide between casuals and regulars. 

Sakurai mentioned a few times he was afraid that the divide was unhealthy for the game, which led to brawl. Not too popular with the competitive community, so they modded it to project M. With Smash 4, there seems to be a nice balance between casual and competitive. Not as technical as melee, but definitely faster paced than brawl. 

With this iteration of smash also comes patching. I don't think this has been done in the past, but it's already been seen how they can patch the game to their needs. Nothing too drastic with the patches yet, though there were a few advanced techs taken out. 

It's fairly easy to pick up. Like I said earlier, the new online component adds another layer that makes it so much easier to practice and connect with others. At the same time, it still is quite competitive and you can find many good players randomly online or even use /r/smashconnect

I don't think they aim to make it as casual as brawl was (or as defensive I should say). At the same time, it doesn't seem like they want to create another melee either. For now, there's good potential for smash 4 to become a competitive game, but whether it overtakes melee and project M is still uncertain.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I'm currently working at a Christmas tree lot in Florida, and I'm not sure if everywhere is like this, but the big box hardware stores tend to get their trees about a week earlier than where I work. We got our shipment on the Monday before Thanksgiving, and the dealer (see what I did there?) told us that they were cut on the Saturday before Thanksgiving. We only sell Fraiser Fir trees. Those are the ones that most people think of when they hear Christmas tree, but I've also worked with Douglas Fir trees. Douglas Firs tend to have softer leaves and thinner branches, so I'd recommENT a Fraiser Fir. Like other people have said in this thread, make sure you cut a half an inch to an inch off the bottom after you buy it because it helps it take in water, and check the water regularly during the first few days you have it because it soaks up a lot during that time. Also, I'd recommend putting some kind of tablecloth underneath the tree because it makes clean up a little bit easier when you have to get rid of the tree after Christmas.

As for what to look for when buying a tree, make sure you check every side of the tree for any bald spots where no branches are growing out. One bald spot can ruin an otherwise perfect tree. Also, don't immediately count out the skinny trees. All the trees at the lot I work at are tied up in the back until we sell one in the display area, and when we unwrap them, the branches stay bunched up for a little bit. Always keep in mind that by the time you have hung ornaments on the tree, the branches will have dropped down a little and the tree will fill out. One last thing is that you shouldn't be too worried if the bottom of the tree isn't perfect because most trees need to be trimmed up at the bottom in order to fit into the tree stand.

Finally, If you're going to tie the tree to the top of your car, make sure the bottom of the tree is pointing towards the front of the car. If it's put on the other way, your tree will get seriously messed up on the drive home because all of the branches will catch the wind.

But I also stock up on invis and sprint pots and try to solo those objectives without a group.^1

What the players do is frustrating, but it *is* understandable. Adding incentives to full participation is a great idea to help solve this, but how it is done is another matter.

The Tavern implies instances. I think placing the quest turn-ins at the end of the instance might not be a bad move. 

One NPC sends you, another for turn-in.

There are a pile of fixes for this, but I think for any of them to be considered the following parameters need to be covered:

+ Players without Taverns should not suffer for it.

+ Players *with* Taverns should not appear to be dicks. 

Because random disconnects can still flag a player as a deserter, it seems unrealistic to simply put a debuff. For Tavern players given the option of spending (potentially) an hour after you could already cash in with no additional incentive, jumping ship is the immediate answer.

Nobody wants to work for no pay. Bosses give less than four gold each, or a gear slot item that they probably do not need. At 30 gold per completion, this is hardly a reward. 

As a Tavern guy, I do apologize for the others that beat feet habitually. We're not all jerks.

We already have two ""kid"" villains (Catwoman and Ivy), with Penguin, Riddler, Harvey and Zsasz all appearing to be in their twenties. That puts them in their forties by the time Bats shows up, which I think is perfectly believable.

I also suspect that the Joker will be a younger character when he's finally introduced, though obviously that's just a guess.

They would be very healthy in a shrimp tank, but you would also have many fewer shrimp than you would without Dario dario swimming around. They will leave adults alone and they will hunt and eat every newly hatched shrimp they can find. (Source: they steal eggs from my peacock gudgeons WHILE the male gudgeon is guarding them. They will do what they need to do to find their food.)

My suggestion would be Heterandria formosa, though they might eat baby shrimp as well (any fish will). Het. formosa (least killifish) are the smallest livebearer. Males are tiny and two males in my old shrimp jar left the baby shrimp alone. They are also very prolific and less frenetic than most livebearers.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; If you can't try at least that hard then I feel I would be just in saying you have avoided the question.

I hope the length of this reply settles your worries.  Be sure to read it through.

**PART I**

Thanks for entertaining the question.  I would push back that if the god of this lawless universe acted consistently, then those consistencies would basically be laws, so there would have to be absolutely zero predictive ability and everything would have to be essentially random.

Also, there's still matter in your scenario, so you haven't *completely* thrown out physics.  A revision of your answer would have to remove that order.  Plus, if there were beings in that universe, they would have to have no ability to think, since that would imply laws or consistency.  Therefore, we shouldn't expect consciousness to exist inside this universe.

**PART II**

Alright, so it'd be a hellhole of nonsense.  Now let's turn to the theistic answer.  As I and others have said, theists believe that the world only exists because each and every moment God sustains it in existence.  Therefore, without God, there is nothing to sustain the world, and it ceases to exist.  A passage from [Feser](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2010/09/classical-theism.html) along the lines of hammie's reply:

&gt; I have emphasized as well in earlier posts that divine conservation – the doctrine that **the world could not exist even for an instant, even in principle, apart from the continuous sustaining action of God** – is also central to classical theism. Just as the classical arguments for God as cause of the world are arguments for an absolutely simple first principle, so too are they (for the most part) arguments for God precisely as conserver or sustainer of the world. And just as divine simplicity is no less central to orthodox theology than it is to classical philosophy, so too is divine conservation. (Ludwig Ott’s well-known manual Fundamentals of Catholic Dogma classifies it too as a de fide doctrine of the Catholic Church.) For classical theism, to say that God creates the world is not merely, and indeed not primarily, to say that He got it going at some time in the past. It is more fundamentally to say the **He keeps it going now, and at any moment at which it exists at all**. As Aquinas says, to say that God makes the world is not like saying that a blacksmith made a horseshoe – where the horseshoe might persist even if the blacksmith died – but rather like saying that a musician makes music, where the music would stop if the musician stopped playing.

Emphasis mine.  This is the stock and party-line answer from classical theism, and that's why we're all saying in this thread that it would be impossible for the world to exist apart from God.

I take it from your dismissals that this isn't what you were looking for.
Now, you can either take the answers you've gotten as the actual answers and conclude you've learned something about others' beliefs, or you can keep pressing for a different answer.  I dearly hope you're not trying to press theists until they give you the answer you want, because that would be intellectually dishonest and undermine your credibility as a seeker of knowledge.

Now, hammie tried to answer your question further [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/2nva8r/to_theists_what_would_the_world_look_like_without/cmh81me).  Essentially, according to the metaphysics that classical theism works under, there must be a being with no ""potential"" to be ""actualized"", since potentials can only be actualized by something actual, and so the chain needs to be terminated at something purely actual, with no potencies.  Basically, a First Cause.

It's a lot more complicated than that, of course, but anything worth arguing about is never simple.  I or hammie would be happy to give you some reading about it if you want to understand it better, but you would need to approach it from a position of wanting to learn, not of wanting to jump on it with claws bared.  I have faith that you can do that if you want to.

So, anyway, since classical theism uses ""God"" only as a name for the First Cause, then we have to look at your question as ""what would the universe look like without a First Cause?""  You can probably see why most theists here said it was impossible, since you're asking for something without the necessary preconditions for it existing!  However, this contradiction can be averted if the universe *is* the First Cause.  Then it wouldn't have something actualizing it, since it's purely actual.  However, this comes at a cost: it has the properties of the First Cause, which include being immaterial - matter has potencies - timeless, spaceless, immutable, and so on.

I guess the layman summary would be: TL;DR if the universe existed without God, the universe would *be* God, with all of the divine attributes.

**PART III**

Now, you could possibly escape the need for a First Cause by appealing to a brute fact, that is, a fact that just *is* with no need for explanation.  This is generally held to be metaphysically inadvisable because of several terrible implications, but let's try to carry it out.

Since the ultimate explanation of the universe is unexplainable, anything immediately explained by the ultimate explanation isn't *really* explained.  An illustration: your parents tell you ""Don't do X"" and you ask why.  They reply with ""because we said so"".  So the explanation for why you don't do X is because they said so.  But then you ask, ""why do you say so?"" and they answer ""because.""  Now you've hit upon a brute fact of sorts: there's no explanation for why your parents say so.  But if your parents say so for no reason, does that really explain why you can't do X?  There's some metaphysics justifying this, but the metaphor should suffice to explain the concept: an explanation immediately explained by an unexplained fact is equally unexplained.

We can extrapolate this further.  Since the facts immediately based on the brute fact are also unexplained, the facts based on *those* facts are unexplained.  This keeps going until we reach the very last level, and find that there are no satisfying explanations for *anything* in the universe.  Therefore, the primary characteristic of the universe you posit I would say would be **a lack of intelligibility**.  This makes science impossible to carry out legitimately, because a brute fact cannot be falsified, making all study of it and facts derived from it (i.e. all facts) unscientific.

If you're about to answer that God is a brute fact and the same things follow, calm down, make yourself some hot cocoa, and take a look at  [this bit](http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/01/brutal-facts-about-keith-parsons.html) about God and brute facts.  If you weren't about to answer that, then I guess you didn't need to read this paragraph.

Anyway, to summarize:  Given that theists envision the world as a creation of God, your vision of an alternate God-less world is far too similar to reality to be what theists actually think of.  There would be *far-reaching* and *fundamental* differences in the worlds.  The best two hypotheticals I can give are that the universe itself would be God and possessing of the divine attributes (immaterial, spaceless, timeless, etc), or the universe would be fundamentally inexplicable.","1417392189"

*Jack pursed his lips a little as if thinking of a different way to hold to hold the gun. Eventually he decided to point his fist at the target with the cannon once again mounted on top. Being a wrist mounted gun, the gun made it hard to hit anything from a distance like this and it wasn't exactly like he had many options when it came to the way he should aim it.*

*Aiming the gun like this was more of a close range technique. It meant that he didn't have to drop his swords to fire at an enemy when in a jam. But at this point he had no idea how to even aim the thing properly, so he'd listen to Leah's advice and learn how to shoot as best he can before he tried anything different.*

We sat in the front row because it was literally the only space available.  Much of the audience is clearly drunk and working on cans of beer in the theater.  Admittedly, we had also enjoyed several tall glasses of water prior to entering.  

So the movie gets to the showdown scene in the latter half and the merry drunk mood of the crowd takes a nasty turn.  People start throwing things and at some point what appears to be a round saw blade flies over our heads and tears through the screen.  Someone behind us shouts ""Kill that white boy!""  

Being in the front row, cans and food are raining down around and on us.  So we start to feel a little self-conscious and decide to low-walk to the nearby exit.  At nearby bar we discussed possible endings, whether Ethan Hawke's character deserved to be shot, and who takes a saw blade to a theater.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","A lot of the motives behind C++ aren't clear to many people.  I'm not sure about your background, but for a lot of people, it just seems nonsense. There is a reason to those things, however. Scott Meyers is somewhat good at pointing out those reasons. You can find lots of his talks on youtube.

For example, the const vs. constexpr. Const in C++ is related to a bunch of stuff, but generally speaking, const specifies a promise that you'll treat a __thing__ that is const as read-only. It doesn't actually mean ""it is constant"" or ""it will never change"". A __thing__ that is a constexpr however is a constant and will never change.

Const is also part of the type of a __thing__. The language gives you mechanism for you to cast away the constness of a type with a __const_cast__. Being part of a type also means you can take advantage of it through the type system.

Constexpr isn't part of a type. When you declare a variable to be constexpr, what this means is that it's constant and that its initialized value can be computed by the compiler. When you declare a function to be a constexpr, it means that it could be evaluated at compile time. Things that are constexpr are highly static and thus can be determined and reasoned about sufficiently by inspecting the source code.

I'm not a C++ expert, so this explanation may be missing, but const and constexpr are different. Things that are consts don't actually have to be constants. The better analogy for const is read-only. For example, you can have mutable data members in a class type that const instances can alter, which means that you can have something const that changes state over time. Besides, const is about the particular access something in your program has. A function may receive a __const int *__ while another receives an __int *__ for the same pointer to int. One is supposed to treat it (the pointed int) as read-only, while the other isn't required to do so. For example, using C style code just for exemplification purposes:

    char s[100] = ""Hi."":
    int len = strlen(s);
    printf(""%d"", len);
    strcat(s, ""hello"");
    len = strlen(s);
    printf(""%d"", len);

For all calls to strlen and strcat, the same value is given as the first parameter. However, strlen takes a __const char*__ while strcat takes a __char*__. What strlen is telling you is that it promises to treat your data (the pointed characters) as read-only, but strcat isn't promising you that (for obvious reasons).

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; So if light cannot escape from near a black hole, why can gravity?

I suppose there are two things we need to clarify the difference between: the field, and the wave. Things with charge produce fields; electrons and protons have electric charge, and they make electric fields when they sit still. Similarly, gravity is the field made by mass. When mass is just sitting still being boring, it curves spacetime around it, which is the source of the gravitational field (or if you want to argue semantics, that curvature really is gravity).

Anyway, when you *accelerate* electric charges the particles start to move. Let's take an electron and make it oscillate and back and forth. As it moves, the field has to get dragged with it, but the information in the field about where the particle is located takes some time to get updated, so now we've made ripples in the field. This is the electromagnetic wave.

Similarly, in the gravitational analog, you don't get a gravitational wave or signal from a mass that's sitting still being boring, like the sun at the center of the solar system. Only when that mass gets accelerated, or starts moving, does it start to *change* the way that space curves around it. This is what produces the gravitational wave. The force of gravity is felt everywhere, because that's the field produced by the mass, but the gravitational waves are produced in space when the mass starts or stops moving. 

So basically, nothing about gravity (either the field or the wave) has to escape anything, because it's the thing preventing the other stuff from escaping!

Hopefully this clears it up.","1417392194"

Since none of the arrests were for disturbing the peace, which generally gets dropped by prosecutors en masse, it's likely all of those people will be standing in front of a judge soon.

If you can, then check the ""System View"" option from the dropdown over its node. From here, you can see the layout of the system if the information is available (sometimes it's not). In that view, you can hover over each station and see what they import and export. If you see a lot of minerals in the export section of the view, head there!

"civ","t5_2rk3b","While you can't (easily, without penalty) sell all your resources+GPT for lump-sum gold before declaring anymore, you *can* sell those resources to get your target to declare war on people.

You can get your target to be at war with half the world. If you act quickly enough, you can capitalize on this to get the ""we fought together against a common foe"" bonus instead of warmonger penalties, which is a *massive* benefit. Probably more useful than lump sum gold, even.

Moreover, if you get them to declare on people they have a DoF with, or popular civs, then you can just go ahead and follow it up (possibly after a turn?) with denouncing them for it. The world will like you for calling them out on ""their"" shit.

In turn, I assume this makes it even easier to buy off other civs to declare war on your target, meaning that now you have the entire world at war with them. Warmonger penalties? What warmonger penalties? You're just keeping the peace by stopping a clear threat to all humankind, here.

---

Another one: if you see an AI about to declare on you, pay them off to declare on another of their neighbors instead. They'll generally leave you alone for quite a while after that.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I don't think you would have much trouble finding communists to explain why they think that focusing on concepts other than *property* would result in better relations between individuals. We don't often get past claim and counter-claim in these forums, but the literature of communism, both anarchist and otherwise, is certainly full of such arguments. And I find propertarians are often less articulate about the advantages of property than they probably think they are. They can, after all, rely on the fact that ""ordinary people"" are generally quite familiar with property as a guiding concept, whether or not they have a very deep understanding of the issues. 

Ultimately, I think modern propertarians haven't really answered the critiques of figures like Proudhon, and they also face the difficulty that traditional theories of property, like that of Locke, assume conditions that probably no longer pertain. Modern neo-""lockean"" property, with its insistence on rivalry as a condition and its rejections of the provisos, is a fairly radical break with the tradition it draws its name from. If you're gong to show the world the virtues of that modern system, new proofs are needed. 

&gt;Let them deal with their territories the way they want, and we ours.

Unfortunately, that ""solution"" already presupposes property...","1417392201"

Is it possible that the mouse acceleration is smoothing it somehow? If so, ill keep playing with it on because ive been doing well with it anyways. But is there a way I can fix it while also having the acceleration off?

Informative post though, thanks! Using a thing on that site it looks like my DPI is somewhere around 1000, and I have my slider thing in the windows settings in the very center

Sakurasou is one of the ones I've seen and I absolutely loved it. Its in a completely different genre than Ergo Proxy. This one is more of a romcom with drama. My top 5 is everchanging but this anime is somewhere up there.

Nagi no Asukara is one of my favorites of all time. It has I believe 26 episodes so it ends up being the perfect length for the story that is told.

"wow","t5_2qio8","on thing no one mentioned is what you are supposted to do in a class. You job is to attack things and kill them. I know that sounds basic but hear me out. There are three parts to a group, the tank, the healer and the DPS (attackers). You are DPS, your job is to attack anything the tank is attacking and deal as much damage as possible. A good DPS will also keep and eye on the healer and make sure nothing breaks off and goes after him. The Tank attacks groups of enemies and keeps their attention while you kill it, the healer keeps your party alive. These are basics. This is how you work in a group of 5 people. Your hunter has ablities that help slow groups down or make targets attack the tank, as you get more experiance playing the game, you will learn how to use these ablities. Also you need to get the right gear, your hunter uses leather armor at first, then mail armor. You need to find gear that adds to your agility. Mail armor is made for hunters and shamans, so unless it has stuff like intelligence or spellpower on it, than you can use it.

(Because if you're projecting everything you stated above in your daily life, it will be even more difficult to connect with people.)

Red-pillers are for the most part, insecure assholes and the majority of people do not think like that. Stop- going to those threads, you go on purpose because its your own way of confirming the sick thoughts you have about yourself. 

You have to find your zest for life, your passion. This will be the key to enjoying your life, finding a husband wont fix your issues- and even if you manage to find someone under these conditions, you might not be able to give your 100%. Keep trying to be the best you that you can, so when you do meet the right person, you'll be ready to be loved and even to leave the relationship in a healthy way if you have to (referring to the staying in bad relationships thing..).

What a struggle. When we hang out and chat it's natural like nothing is wrong. I worry about regret if I break up with her. Everyone just assumes we're perfect and will be together for the long haul. We talk so naturally about our future and how well it jives etc. I don't know how to bring it up to her. Maybe I will wait until after wednesday because she has something large due and I don't want to stress her out. But then it's like, am I really ready to just break up with her? No! But then again why wait? What do I stand to gain? More heartache, really... but it's almost like I need to see it get worse. Maybe I'll give myself a silent time-limit, but then I don't know if I can participate in this anxious sex event again without saying something, either. Of course, even that seems like a bad idea, because it will be late, and talking about things in the heat of the moment seems like a terrible idea. God, I don't know what's the best course of action. :( I think I need to start a dialogue being really specific and firm that I am unhappy with our sex life and that the issue has only gotten worse over time despite talking about it many times over 2.5 yrs. That it isn't either of our faults, we are just mismatched. Ideally in this dialogue I wouldn't end it right then, but set the wheels turning, because despite all our discussions it would seem like a big sudden shock to her and she's actually expressed fear before that that will happen (that I'll suddenly just get fed up and leave her over this issue).

You do realize that all of these countries rely heavily on their resource wealth and with the exception of Norway non of them invested any more sustainably than Russia. They all relied on unbridled resource exploitation.

&gt; It's completely unsustainable and unless major change happens we will probably see Russia have serious problems in as little as 50 years time (major depression or revolt).

The US sustains itself through resource exploitation and war while it's the biggest human rights violator on the planet. It is an oligarchy that suffers under severe socioeconomic inequality, has the social mobility of countries like Pakistan, and pretty much the only reason people are complacent is their level of indoctrination paired with being comparatively rich (tendency: falling). Their wealth is based entirely on unsustainable economics and their global influence that so far was able to sustain their unreasonable and exceptional position is faltering. It's an incredibly energy inefficient nation and a significantly worse per capita polluter than its rival China. It also lacks investment in literally all things of social importance (i.e. infrastructure, education, socialized healthcare, social security, etc.).   

So, what's your prognosis for the US? (Serious question.)","1417392218"

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","For your first question, we've been in the house for just shy of 9 years. We refinanced $10k of our credit card debt into a home equity loan at one point because we got a lower rate and additionally mortgage/HOL interest is tax deductible, meaning we ""got a percentage of it back"" at tax time by not having to pay federal income tax on the money spent toward interest on that debt.  It worked for us, but it's VERY risky in that you're tying your irresponsible debt into your home. Only do it if you have reached full 100% discipline with credit and debt.

As for refinancing, you'll have to pay closing fees, including a fee to the lender, some taxes, state fees, fees for recording the deed, etc. So you have to do the math. With the reduced rate and resulting lower total monthly interest, how many months of that dollars saved will it take to have saved the amount you just paid to the bank and fees? That's your break-even point. After that point, you're actually saving money. Getting a shorter term mortgage such as 15yr is just a choice. You get slightly better rates with 15yr or shorter than you do with longer mortgages.  Also, your credit score may be improved, which also gives you access to better rates. And finally, we bought when good credit got you 6.75% on a 30yr loan. We refinanced when good credit got you 3.375% on a 15yr. We shaved 6.5yrs off of our loan and still saved about $175/month on our payment.. It was a no brainer for us.","1417392219"

""The following procedure will determine the Big 12 Conference representative to the Sugar Bowl (or alternate College Football Playoff game when the Sugar Bowl is a semifinal) in the event of a first-place or alternate place tie (for the avoidance of doubt, only Conference records will be used throughout the process):

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","Along the lines of familial kidnapping, I'd notify your child's school as well as each of his teachers personally that under no circumstances are these people allowed near your child. Each and every one of his teachers needs to be contacted individually in the event they manage to scam their way past the front office by phone and try to talk to his teachers themselves. If there is a blue emergency contact card (the thing you fill out at beginning of year) make sure all information is up to date if you've changed cell phones, etc. There should be a field listing who is NOT to pick up your child as well. If you need to change anything, take it to the school yourself and show it to the office by hand, and watch them change the info. (I can't tell you how many times I've tried to get ex off absentee auto call list, until I've had to go in person three times to get someone to set it right)

If he has an afterschool program, even if it's within that same school, sports, anything, you need to not only speak to whoever is in charge of those programs, as well as whoever handles your son directly. This includes sunday school, anything outside of school, babysitters. 

(Though I'm sure you handled this)

Since you have stated their finances are not so good, I can't help but wonder if that is their motivation. My ex used to threaten me with custody all the time (he was convinced I was making millions from social security/disability, not sure where he got that idea from), and he was under the impression I'd have to pay HIM for child support once he got the kids...yeah. &lt;.&lt;

I'd talk to the school's counselor privately and advise them of the situation, and see what their take is on this. Would they sit down with your son and go over what to do if someone is 'inappropriate' with him, and what to do in an emergency? 

See if you have recent pictures of these family members, including the aunt that called you. Make copies. (The kidnapping possibility is low, but it never hurts to be on alert. These people sound crazy)

I'm sure you've done most if not all of this already, but sometimes seeing it in a list helps.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Not sure if new versions of guitar hero are released, in particular. If they were to release a newer version though then yeah. The computer has a dongle plugged in for the DRM key thing. 

Need For Speed GTs have updated versions though. The very very old disc in the game at the location was version 1.03. I had to burn my own 1.24 or somewhere around there disc because the video cards inside were newer than the drivers in 1.03. 

A lot of things are fixed just by reloading the software, which is done just like you'd reload windows. The games on our route though are all very old so I carry around a new cd drive to use because most of the ones in the machines are broke or just too dirty to work. You just pop the cd in, and reboot the machine and normally it goes by itself without needing to press any keys. 

Those had a security dongle as well. It wouldn't be just plug and play if you wanted to convert one game to be a different game. They also have boards outside of the computer in the game.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I could give you some answers here. Many people that are decent guys that want to join a 1%'er club usually do so for a wide variety of reasons. Some because they like the 'excitement', some because they like the fact that they'll be 'respected' or 'feared', some because they desire to have that 'tough man' persona to fill their ego or use as a sort of bragging right, and a plethora of other reasons.

On the flip side of reasons, some do it out of a need to fill a void in their life of belonging to something bigger, and some just desire that feeling of brotherhood that they had in the past, that they are lacking. Such as brothers in arms or other type of group they once belonged. There is a myriad of others, but those are some of the main things. 

Now, to start your own 'MC' you're looking at a whole new hornets nest that many don't want to kick... It's not as easy as just wearing a couple matching jackets and starting a fun family club. Once other MC's see that, they look at it as if you are encroaching on their territory (regardless of your intentions) and then they either demand that you and your 'members' pay homage to them (pay them hundreds of dollars a month to operate your 'fun club') or you do consistent 'favors' for them to stay in their good graces (such as wash their bikes, store some drugs for them, or anything else they see fit).

If you choose not to stay in their good graces by paying homage (extortion), or be their errand boys, then they'll gladly make your lives, your members' lives, and daily life a compete living hell filled with trouble and constantly living in fear. They do this because they feel 'threatened' that you may be a rival group just trying to operate in their area under the guise of doing 'good', or because they feel you may take away from the open market of money and gifts they earn/recieve from the numerous poker runs, paid parties, charity runs, and events they put on every year. More clubs in the area means less money for their individual club.

Now, keep in mind, this is ONLY for MC's against other MC 's. The way around all of this nonsense it's to open an AMA certified charter (American Motorcycle Association). But then you're still paying in money (dues and fees) to a larger organization for rights to be an AMA club, and you will also not be respected by any of your 'MC hardened' peers. But it's better than dealing with the other issues that would arise as opening an MC.

There are tons and tons of GREAT clubs, members, and chapters out there that have nothing to do with illegal activities and that are the kindest upstanding citizens you will ever meet, on both sides of the coin in both 1% MC and AMA clubs. But, there are also a lot of scumbags that are the exact opposite, and that ruin the reputation of the others by playing right into the stereotype of 'big bad biker'. All in all, they're just like any other large group of people. There's great ones, bad ones, and all that's in between.

Many clubs, some off today's biggest and baddest, were originally founded as a way for groups of friends to have each other's backs and to legitimately improve their surroundings/neighborhoods without being demonized or attacked in harsh neighborhoods/cities/areas, that were prone to violence and poverty and gang invested. They choose to kinda fight fire with fire to further their own agendas that started out noble and good intentioned. Many others were started by war vets that had no direction after the various wars and lacked that feeling of brotherhood they had in service. 

As they slowly earn respect and gain a lot of power while also becoming very large, a few bad apples abuse that power and respect (along with bad decision making) and end up making the entire bushel look bad.  Obviously it's much deeper than just this one post I'm writing could explain, but this should give a little better insight I hope. 

I always suggest others not to join anything and just ride to have fun and just be supportive of all other riders and groups as well. You don't have to be patched up or have a vest with 'colors' on to hang out, have fun, and live any certain lifestyle you choose. And hey, if you choose that you want to sell drugs, extort others, chop bikes, have sex parties, and live dangerously under the constant notion that you can be killed or go to prison at any given moment of your life, and lose everything you've ever worked for, then I'm quite sure you can do all of that just fine all by yourself anyways.


Source: Raised by a father figure that was/is the president of one of said large MC's and was around/hung out with them (selectively) for over the past 15 years or so.

TL/DR- Don't join something for the wrong reasons, to boost your ego, or to feel like you're fulfilling some void in your life. You can ride and have fun with your knees in the breeze just fine without having to look or pkay the part or strengthen the stereotype.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Bem, que grupos ativistas só atacam aquilo que acham interessante atacar, isso é óbvio demais para se perder mais de duas linhas falando a respeito. Eu, particularmente, acho que liberdade de expressão é liberdade de expressão e quem não aguenta ouvir, just deal with it.

Agora, sobre o funk em si, eu tenho a seguinte opinião:

- Música que choca pelo conteúdo sempre existiu, o que é dificil é perceber isso uma vez que o que já foi tabu antes, hoje é aceito, normal ou banal. Imagina uma menina de 10 anos cantando [*""I touch myself""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-JrDCSHbLk) há 25 anos atrás, ou [*""Abre essas pernas""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BKFj4nfewU) há quase 20 anos. E não nos esqueçamos da [*""Geni e o Zepelim""*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mO-wZ44puRY) (tenta fazer a sua avó cantar e você vai ver como essa letra pode ser indecente para quem tem mais de 50 anos). Aliás, lembrei do melhor exemplo: [Short Dick Man no Xou da Xuxa](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4qU6t1ZH24). Sinto muito OP, mas se assustar com letras mais pesadas de música hoje como se isso fosse novidade é ignorar muita coisa que já foi feita;

- Boa parte das críticas que eu vejo a respeito do funk é sobre a parte explicíta dos termos e situações. Alguém acharia ""menos pior"" se ussassem pênis ao invés de c@ralho, vagina no lugar de b*ceta e relações sexuais para não falar comer? É o termo em si, a situação descrita ou o público que consome que torna o funk um ""problema""?

- O funk abusa da conotação sexual apenas porque isso ainda é tabu. E foi feito, principalmente, por um povo sem cultura e para um povo sem cultura, que precisa consumir algo de simples digestão (é só ver a densidade das tramas da novelas, por exemplo). Fazendo um paralelo entre maturidade cultural e idade, pessoas que criam e consomem funk estão no mesmo nível da molecada de escola que desenha o Snoopy escondendo um C+U, ou aqueles desenhos anatômicos do pênis, com riqueza de detalhes no quadro negro da escola.

Não estou dizendo necessariamente que o funk é bom ou ruim; pelo contrário, acho que o primeiro erro quando surge essa discussão é tentar transformar arte em algo ""bom"" ou ""ruim"" e, mais, traçar um relação de ""arte boa"" == ""arte que me agrada"". Eu acho que arte é simplesmente um reflexo de um grupo e, nesse sentido, o máximo que poderia dizer é que ""arte boa"" é aquela que consegue retratar características importantes daquele grupo... e, nesse ponto, eu acho que - infelizmente! - o funk tem sido, sim, bem-sucedido...","1417392232"

A lightsaber is the final step towards becoming a jedi/sith because it requires a high level of force mastery to be able to construct a lightsaber.  Based on the fact that all known siths are dead post ROTJ, this is more than likely a self taugh sith who constructed his/her own lightsaber without prior knowledge of how to do it.  This would result in a poorly focused blade that would somewhat represent the lightsaber seen in the trailer.  To take this one step further, I beleive it may be the second lightsaber they constructed, the first one probably exploding in the siths hand causing severe bodily harm.  The exhaust vents on the saber seen in the trailer would vent off the excess energy to prevent that saber from exploding again.  ","1417392233"

&gt;They weren't 'cast off', they left Britain by choice.

Really?  Ever heard of the State of Georgia?  It's bigger than England.  It was founded as a penal colony.  Many of the other early immigrants were being persecuted for their non-conformist religious beliefs.  So yeah, I'd say a significant number of them were ""cast off"".  They didn't fit into your ""awesome"" society, and built their own.  Seems like you did the same thing with Australia, and they ended up pretty well off as well.  Maybe you should start keeping these people you like to kick out and you'll end up with a thriving country again.

http://thehistoryofbyzantium.com/

Free on iTunes (save two episodes). It's a much deeper historical study than most historians make. Author Robin Pierson conceived it as an heir to The History of Rome, but the latter is overrated and unnecessary to study Byzantium. Pierson is just now at the start of the 8th century, and is covering the sweep of Islam into the Roman Levant and Africa.

I cannot recommend it highly enough.



""Once out of nature I shall never take

My bodily form from any natural thing,

Of hammered gold and gold enamelling

Or set upon a golden bough to sing

To lords and ladies of Byzantium

Also, these pictures were taken a day after I washed it. We have a car wash at my job, its not the best thing in the world but it would only look marginally better if it was hand washed. So all of the micro-shits on the hood is not dust.

* Turtle Wax Rubbing Compound, which I can't even use because I left it in my trunk in freezing weather, and the thing shrunk into a small solid disk

* No 7 Polishing Compound, which I just really don't know how to use 

* Nu Finish Scratch Doctor, which only hides scratches in my experience, but did really good at hiding the scratches behind the door handle

*Some Spray on Wax, don't even remember the brand


I've also got several microfiber cloths, though I made the mistake of throwing them in the washing machine and all it's done is collected lint and shit, and it might scratch my if I use it on my car.

I have often wondered; if one day a sentient machine is created, would it be just as ostracised as we are? Forever looking in at the human condition but never really being a part of it?","1417392236"

I think the reason I'm so happy and he's so happy is because for the most part we are pretty independent. and we like our space. But he also still takes care of his responsibilities and makes time for me.

My family is Jewish, and even naming children after living relatives is a big no-no in Jewish families, much less renaming yourself.

Even though I don't identify as Jewish myself, it's ingrained enough into me that it would just feel weird doing something like that. For example, I actually considered Sara as a middle name, but decided against it because I have a cousin with that name, and it would be way too weird to use her name in any way.

On the other hand, if your family has a tradition of naming children after living relatives, you might be able to get away with it.","1417392238"

Mind you, the fx in the video is even clocked higher. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26UKz42uQ1Y

Still not valid unless you force it onto a single core. Which is trivial to do.

&gt; http://www.anandtech.com/bench/product/698?vs=1261 In this one, both CPUs are clocked at 3.5GHz, scores are from cinabench single threaded benchmark: The i5 4690k scores 7619 points The fx 8320 scores 3987 points That's a 91% difference.

They may have the same clock speed, but they're in no way intended to hit similar segments of the market. You're comparing a $110 processor to a $210 processor. And you're also taking the single most extreme difference between them as the gold standard there; in the second Cinebench 11.5 benchmark the difference is only 61%. Last time I checked, that averages out to 76%, not 100%.

But hey, as it happens, there's some fine single-threaded comparisons of these exact processors;

http://www.cpu-world.com/benchmarks/AMD/FX-8350_single.html

Looks like the difference across multiple benchmarks is more like 50-60%.  Which is very, very different from ""about 100%.""","1417392239"

Her eyes, two cold hard pools.
They brought me to the boys and girls
Whom she had made her fools.

To be a pretty lady,
Little, little did I know
That now I would be fading.

I dare not care if life's unfair,
Don't tell me that you truly care
You judge me by just standing there,
I shrink away from your eyes' glare.

Mia is love, Ana is life,
I want to grow up just like them,
Numb to all the pain and strife,
Dumb and gorgeous, fatal and femme.

Let me waste away
Until I am gone.
Show me the light
That I am waiting upon.

The recovery can be yours,
I'll let you be the hero.
I'll go from eights to fours,
Then two, zero, double zero.

Skeleton girl coming soon,
I'll be broken and lovely,
Pale and cratered as the moon,
I'll be the antithesis of cuddly.

But who needs love,
Who has need of life,
When Ana-Mia above
Lets me drown in her strife?

I don't care about you,
Because you're not a truth-giver.
This much ain't a lie:
I don't care if I shiver.

I lost ten pounds today
By cutting off my head.

Don't end up dead.

It is the only thing that makes sense to me at this point as to why more players haven't been busted.

Or, of course, they could NOT be cheating, but I don't know, for me, personally, it seems way too suspicious and fishy. Not all the .gifs posted, but most of them.

I can believe that you sometimes ""lock on"" to people when you just swipe your 180, but not as often as it seems Flusha does.

It doesn't get super grindy on normal until the post game stuff, where you suddenly are expected to jump 50-100+ levels in between objectives.

Also I expect if you choose hard, you will have to constantly swap characters in/out according to weakness' and strenghths. Which will obviously make you grind, considering you need 6 party members up to date, rather then 3 you need on easy.

IIRC I had everything but the 100 hour trophy in around 25-40 hours and resorted to leaving my vita on with a rubber band around the R button to hit the 100. I didn't max out, but if you wanted to thats probably where the IAP and super grind comes in.","1417392242"

If one had total knowledge of the physical workings of the brain, could we not say ""that particular exchange of synaptic firings triggers this part of the sensation of taste through mechanism ABC"" which wouldn't translate to ""taste is physical"" *per se* but with that hypothetical complete knowledge of the brain, knowing the complete information wouldn't give you the sensation itself, but could nonetheless make you capable of triggering the sensation, no? 

I'm obviously out of my element here, but consider software.  Nowhere in a computer could one 150 years ago look at a monitor and say ""that is where that is coming from"".  They would seem too disconnected.  Despite this, software is at the end of the day reducible to physical location of components of the machine.  

I mean, what's the alternative?  Would anything but physicality not challenge naturalism?  ","1417392242"

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","If it were me, the first thing I would do is extricate myself from Adobe's cloud.  I assume that Adobe Cloud is a combination of their desktop applications with remote server storage, at Adobe of course, and that they sell it as a convenient way of accessing your projects from multiple devices (the upside), while not mentioning their complete control over your data (the downside), charging a nominal fee for storage subscriptions (the upside for them).

That is really what you need to think about, and decide if you want to be a part of that kind of arrangement.  If you do, and you want to have that arrangement with Adobe, it seems obvious that you need to run an operating system that Adobe approves and supports their software running on.  Adobe straddles the fence between Windows and OS X.  Linux does not exist in their version of the universe.

If you want to run Linux on a personal machine, by all means do so.  But don't expect it to replace your Adobe industrial design workstation.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","The A's are always risky, because non-risky proven players are expensive.

The A's will always acquire risky with potential upside.

And the A's will trade away players who are proven because once the player is proven, both expense and decline will follow.

Donaldson is about to become expensive.  And I don't think he's going to decline (right away) but he is unlikely to get much better (although that would be pretty awesome).

Consider, Reddick was acquired for proven closer Bailey.

Moss was a bottom budget FA.

Norris was acquired for proven Gio Gonzalez.

Jarrod Parker was acquired for proven Cahill (who quickly declined)

Lowrie and Kazmir were coming out of injury ridden years when they were acquired.

And as I mentioned above, Donaldson was the risky guy himself, acquired for proven Rich Harden.

Dan Haren was proven (at the time), and the A's traded him (+conor robertson) for Brett Anderson, Chris Carter, Aaron Cunningham, Dana Eveland, Carlos Gonzalez and Greg Smith.  All of whom played in the majors at some point, and Anderson, Carter, Eveland and obviously CarGo had big success in the majors.

There are other trades that didn't work out as well, but how can you argue with success?  The A's made the playoffs for 50% of Beane's seasons, while being outspent by 80% of the league.  Playoff success is elusive, surely.  But I'm confident that the A's are going to put out a team with a chance to win.

I believe that (1) the A's might have good ways of measuring future success, but (2) it doesn't matter because the A's have to do these trades anyway.","1417392243"

However, the acting and the script were what I disliked the most.  I think the exchanges between characters got kinda unnatural at times, and the facial expressions and body language was off as well.  But overall, I think it was cool.

Baldur's gate games are examples of tactical rpg. You have a squad, issue commands, position them etc. Dragon age Origins played in a very similar manner to those games.

Dragon age 2 and inquistion however do not, people complaining about the move from tactical rpgs towards action rpg button mashing are not complaining about whatever arbitrary amount of tactics/difficulty you personally feel are required in the encounters but the change in gameplay.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; why would I every write the biased code fragment, always taking all elements into consideration?

If you didn't know any better.

Believe me, there are *plenty* of people who make this mistake. It's natural to think of shuffling by swapping any two cards in the entire hand without reducing the range on each step. It seems like it should be ""more random"".

In a sense it is more random, in that there are more ending states: in the example given of shuffling 1 2 3, you end up with 127 ending states versus only 6 using the F-Y algorithm. The trouble is, they aren't 127 *unique* states, there are only 6 unique states however you shuffle, so the ""extra randomness"" doesn't go into the distribution of states, it goes into the *frequency* of states. That is, some states are more common than others, hence a biased shuffle.

This image from the original article shows the difference:

http://datagenetics.com/blog/november42014/dk.png

Clearly the blue line is *far* more noisy than the orange line. Alas, it's noise that makes the shuffles more predictable, not less.","1417392246"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My partner has two good friends who started dating as high school Freshmen, and never stopped. They married after college, and have kids in middle school now. They're absolutely in love with each other. They seem from what I know of them to be quite happy. It does happen.  But they're also obviously very communicative, careful with the other's feelings, devoted to each other.

The reason that everyone says you'll break up is because most people do.  You need to accept the possibility of change. Lots of people who don't break up, who date their high school beau through college or whatever, end up regretting it; sticking with the person you loved as a kid can keep you from fully stretching your wings as an adult.

It's not inevitable. But if you want it to _work,_ both you and she need to be on the same page about a lot of things.  First, you both need as much room around your individuality as possible. You're about to enter a period of incredible growth, you're going to grow up more in the next five years than you have in the last ten. You're going to learn a lot, be put in so many new situations--if you want to have the same partner at the end of it, you need to let that happen! Not to try to stand still.

Partners can grow with each other if they have the same goals, and those goals don't choke either of them.  So go into college with both of you knowing that marriage is on the track ahead of you, but at the same time...you can't let that stop you from growing.

Dont have to worry about buying them, dont need to worry about depreciating my car, dont have to sneak out on a date to have a smoke.

Good luck.

My mother died of Pancreatic cancer, probably linked to her smoking. 15 minutes before she lapsed into her final coma on the day she died, she had to have one more ciggarette.

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt; SJWs are at the core of the corruption, have you been living under a rock?

Wow, that's a new one. You might want to share it with everyone in GG who says they're a distraction, or merely an annoyance, or a parallel issue. Are we still talking about the corruption of game journalists giving good coverage for favors? Or is ""the corruption"" something else now?

&gt; I don't understand how you can be rude enough to waste someone's time discussing a topic that you know nothing about (evidenced by your questioning of why we're going after Gawker, a site that owns Kotaku and a whole bunch of other clickbait bullshit sites). Please at least have the common courtesy to ask questions and get information before creating an opinion based on the narrative of the exact media that we're exposing 

That is precisely what I did. What is the ""betrayal"" that you mentioned earlier? How did Gawker betray you? 

&gt; Why would 2 random people matter? We are all leaders of gamergate, and equal. Milo and RSG are not leading us. Not that I have a bad opinion of them - I like RSG and I'm neutral, leaning negative (due to his transphobia, though that's not related to GG) on Milo (but it is 100% undeniable that he is helping us, don't really care about his motivations).

You know, if someone's with a agenda is helping you, you really should pause and wonder why. And do you really think you're ""equal"" in that you have as much power over the conversation as these guys? If Total Biscuit said something tomorrow, and you said the opposite thing, which would get more attention?

But the point is, and I'll ask again, how do you know the people involved with this are sincere? How do you say with confidence that a mass of people, even if they're individually well-meaning, will collectively be a force of good? You know what they say about roads and good intentions.

&gt; Anyway, sorry, facts trump your beliefs, GamaSutra's views have been completely demolished, and Gawker's advertisers are draining away fast (both publicly, and more importantly, silently to avoid PR impact).
http://wiki.gamergate.me/index.php?title=Projects:Operation_Disrespectful_Nod/Advertisers#Pulled_Advertisers

You have pulled two advertisers from GamaSutra, and yes, Intel has reinstated, bringing your total to one (and for the record I have never once seen Arguing on the Internet ""completely demolish"" anyone's views, whatever that's suppose to mean). ","1417392249"

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","You're confusing the ideas we describe numbers with to describe numbers fundamentally.  If you mean to say that numbers simply exist outside of our universe, in some Platonic plane, and that numbers ""occur"" to you in their pure numerical form, then you're speaking pure nonsense, because numbers are clearly described by the philosophical ideas of the time period, and the idea that there's platonic forms anyway is nearly indefensible.

It's not as if infinitesimals ""occurred"" to Leibniz out of a Platonic plane.  It's not as if zero ""occurred"" out of another plane, too.  The reason the Greeks didn't have a number for zero was they had a bias in their philosophy against nothingness.  The basic idea here is that no, numbers are not absolute, they exist as our social construction, and this is obvious by any historical analysis.

Similarly, no, it is impossible to *actually* divide numbers to infinity, because humans can't repeat any process to infinity.  We don't exist long enough to do it.  You're making the mistake of assuming that the way we speak of these ideas in mathematics to make them consistent is how they actually are: again, this is purely a falsehood.  We can make predictions as to the limit of an infinite series, but we can never sum an infinite series.  It's literally impossible to do an infinity of things.

Look, you and I can imagine any solid object painted red.  This is just like we can imagine an arbitrary amount of division.  Still, we can't paint all solids red and we can't divide forever.  Until you bridge these ideas with reality, no, infinity and infinite division do not and cannot *actually* happen, do not actually happen, and never will actually happen.  They are purely ideas.

And if you're going to actually assert that the Platonic plane of numbers exist, then explain why numbers are a product of historical context, please, because there's probably a nobel prize or infinite fame waiting there for whoever can actually divide into infinity in real life.","1417392252"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","For Seattle to get cold the wind has to come down from the North over cold land.  The prevailing Westerly winds go a long stretch over liquid ocean, so at least at the surface level cannot differ too much from the temperature of the sea.  The sea cannot be too much less than 0.  Compared to the atmosphere the ocean is very massive, and mixing allows for consideral depth of thermal distribution .

This is why those hot summer days have stagnant air or offshore flows.  Even in summer onshore winds are cool.

Land has high thermal resistance, so on clear nights in winter its thermal energy radiates into space.  It gets colder and colder.  Alaska is very wide, so the winds that come down through Vancouver are far from the sea and have been blowing over cold ground that does not warm it much even during the day.","1417392263"

Having sex even one or two more times wouldn't have made it regular enough to have a habit or expect it, and since neither of us had any experience, it wasn't any better than oral (actually probably worse).

Section 4. [**Playability**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay#Playability) of article  [**Gameplay**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay): [](#sfw)

&gt;

&gt;Playability is the ease by which the game can be played or the quantity or duration that a game can be played and is a common measure of the quality of gameplay.  Playability evaluative methods target games to improve design while player experience evaluative methods target players to improve gaming.""  This is not to be confused with the ability to control (or play) characters in multi-character games such as [role playing games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role_playing_game) or [fighting games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fighting_game), or factions in [real-time strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy) games.

&gt;Playability is defined as: a set of properties that describe the Player Experience using a specific game system whose main objective is to provide enjoyment and entertainment, by being credible and satisfying, when the player plays alone or in company. Playability is characterized by different attributes and properties to measure the [video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game) player experience. 

&gt;


&gt;* __Satisfaction:__ the degree of gratification or pleasure of the player for completing a video game or some aspect of it like: mechanism, graphics, user interface, story, etc. Satisfaction is a highly subjective attribute that provokes a difficult measuring due to player preferences and pleasures having influence in the satisfaction for specific game elements: characters, virtual world, challenges, and so on.

&gt;* __Learning:__ the facility to understand and dominate the game system and mechanics (objectives, rules, how to interact with the video game, etc.). The Desktop Systems try to minimize the learning effort, but in video games we can use the learning curve according to the game nature. For example, in one hand, we can demand great initial abilities before to play, or training them harshly in first phases of the game, to help players to understand and dominate all the game rules and resources and they can use them from the beginning of the game. In the other hand, players can learn step by step in a guided way when they need some ability in the video game.

&gt;* __Efficiency:__ the necessary time and resources to offer fun and entertainment to players while they achieve the different game objectives and reach the final goal. An efficient video game is able to catch the player's attention from the first instant, and provoke him to continue playing to the end of the game. Efficiency can be analyzed as the correct use of the challenge through the game, the correct structuring of the objectives or the best adaptation of the control to the actions in the game.

&gt;* __Immersion:__ the capacity to believe in the video game contents and integrate the player in the virtual game world. The immersion provokes that the player looks involved in the virtual world, becoming part of this and interacting with it because the user perceives the virtual world represented by the video game, with its laws and rules that characterize it. A video game has a good immersion level when it has equilibrium between the proposed challenges and the necessary player abilities to overcome it.

&gt;* __Motivation:__ the characteristics that provoke the player to realize concrete actions and persist in them until their culmination. To obtain a high degree of motivation, the game should have a set of resources to ensure the players perseverance in the performed actions to overcome the game challenges. This means, different factors to make sure positive behavior in the interpretation of the game process, focusing the player on the proposed challenges, showing the relevance of the objectives to reach and reward for challenges, promoting the player confidence to face them and the pleasure to achieve them.

&gt;* __Emotion:__ the involuntary impulse, originated in response to the stimulus of the video game and induces feelings or unleashes automatic reactions and conducts. The use of emotions in video games help to obtain a best player experience and leads players to different emotional states: happiness, fear, intrigue, curiosity, sadness… using the game challenges, story, aesthetic appearance or the music compositions that are capable of move, affect, to make to smile or to cry to the player. A big success of video games is that they can provoke to players different feelings in a short space of time, some of them hardly obtainable daily in the real world.

&gt;* __Socialization:__ the degree of the set of game attributes, elements and resources that promote the social factor of the game experience in group. This kind of experience provokes appreciating the video game in a different way, thanks to the relations that are established with other players or with other characters of the game that help the player to resolve jointly the game challenges in a collaborative, competitive or cooperative way. The game socialization allows players to have a totally different game experience when they play with other persons and promote new social relationships thank to the interaction among them. In addition to this, socialization also is present at how the social connections that we have are projected with the group in the characters of the video game and context in which the game is realized. For example, choosing the player to be connected or to share something, interacting, obtaining information, asking for help, or negotiating for some items, and how our influence with the other character is positive or negative to achieve the game objectives. To promote the social factor it is advisable to develop new shared challenges that help players to integrate and being satisfied with the new game rules and objectives, creating a set of collective emotions where players (or characters) encourage and motivate themselves to overcome the collective challenges

&gt;The playability analysis is a very complex process due to the different point of view to analyze the different part of video game architecture. Each facet allows us to identify the different playability's attributes and properties affected by the different elements of video game architecture.  The playability's facets are:

&gt;


&gt;* __Intrinsic Playability:__ the playability based on the own video game nature and how it is showed by the player. It is strongly related to the GamePlay and Game Mechanic. In this facet we can analyze the video game design implementation especially video game rules, goals, objectives, rhythm and other design mechanics.

&gt;* __Mechanical Playability:__ the video game quality as a software system. It is related to the Game Engine, with special emphasis, for example, in the fluency of the movie scenes, correct lights, shadows and rendering, sound and music, graphics motions, character personality implementation and communication systems in a multiplayer video game.

&gt;* __Interactive Playability:__ player interaction and video game user interface development, for example interaction dialog and game controls. This playability is easily visible in the Game Interface.

&gt;* __Artistic Playability:__ the quality of the video game arts and aesthetics in the game elements: visual graphics, sound effects, music and melodies, storyline and storytelling and how these elements are showed in the video game.

&gt;* __Intrapersonal Playability__ or __Personal Playability__: the individual vision, perception, and feelings that the video game produces in each player when they play the game. It has a highly subjective value.

&gt;* __Interpersonal Playability__ or __Social Playability:__ the group consciousness and different user perceptions when the player plays with other player in a competitive, cooperative or collaborative way.

&gt;Finally, the ""global"" playability of a video game will be deduced through each attribute value in the different playability's facets. It is crucial to improve the playability in the different facets to guarantee the best player experience when the player plays the video game.

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","I respectfully disagree. When unions act alone, they do so for their members, but when they work together, joining to fight for, say, minimum wage increases or pharmacare, they do it for everyone. When governments act for their constituents, they may have limited interests just the same, but where they have sought to affect more than just their own constituents, they have cut taxes and favoured privatization. So, when they concern themselves with just those they represent, their actions are reasonably limited to seeking the benefit for a few. But the problem is, where unions and governments aim for an effect grander than just their constituents, the trend has been that unions aim for the national good, and governments have secured the good only for the rich and for corporate interests.

I speak about the CPC and the LPC, here, as well as various provincial governments.

As the other user said, I'd like to know how you believe that governments represent all of Canadians. I understand that this is their job, but there is a difference here between their ""representing"" all Canadians and their ""acting in the interest"" of all Canadians. To be more precise: the reason the current CPC has been one of the most divisive and polarizing governments in Canadian history is precisely because they serve the interests of some Canadians at the obvious expense of others in a way most governments in the past (including Tory ones) have not.","1417392275"

If that were so, then when we looked into space we'd see ourselves as the light from earth took a circular path around the sun before arriving at our retinas. Earth has in fact an elliptical orbit around the sun to all observers.

You can't just expect politics to just happen—you gotta go out there and represent your interests and fight for the change you want to see.

Also, framing politics as 'why does X take a backseat to Y?' is silly and zero-summish. Gay marriage passing in a country or state doesn't prevent marijuana activists from advocating the reform they want.","1417392276"

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","I see one problem when I try to identify with tanks as a DOTA 2 player. You don't exist in DOTA 2 as a tank because generally speaking it is impossible to pull aggro from other players (With the idea that they will ignore targets designed to absorb damage in the first place). Of course there are exceptions, but I think support classes and more positioning based heroes like Bastion will be easier for a DOTA player.

To DOTA players tanks would be better suited/played as initiators. Any hero that can jump right into a battle and force reactions. Her design isn't quite correct for it, but in a different world Tracer would be more familiar to a DOTA 2 player than Winston. She is hard to kill, but not tanky. She is a threat that can force the team to react to her, and she has great tools to go in first and come back out. She is like a Sand King or a Slark. Winston is like Abaddon. He can be nigh unkillable, at which point you kill his team, or when he is vulnerable, you just coordinate first and remove his contribution. In DOTA this isn't a problem, because Abaddon's ability to heal and save teammates is his priority, absorbing damage is a bonus (Hell it even heals him).

Interestingly enough the other offensive classes aren't all designed with the combination of escape and initiation. I hope there aren't too many tanks that are designed to just walk forward and start fights that way. Tidehunter is like that and it is extremely obnoxious.","1417392277"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Pathogens are actually not very interested in giving their host a hard time. Why? The more dangerous it acts, the stronger and quicker the host's (or its immune system's) reaction is, or worst when killing the host the pathogen can't benefit in the long term. Evolutionarily speaking it is a more favorable trait for a pathogen to act decent, maybe even nearly invisible, in order to not startle or kill the host. In fact, killing an entire species may limit the survivability of the pathogen itself. Maybe the ""pathogen"" could even develop beneficial traits for the host in order to increase its own chances, which would lead to symbiotic relationships.

The thing is that this is a development very specific for the primary host, which could be whichever animal. Those things when infecting a host that is not designated fall apart: either the pathogen is unable to inhabit the foreign host at all, or causes a very severe pathological reaction because limiting interactions are just not available in this new kind of habitat. Consequently the host, for example the human body, will react very violently and very symptomatically when encountering pathogens that would naturally inhabit rodents or pigs or other kinds of animals.","1417392277"

NK and Middle East may be too politically sensitive to release a game there seeing as Koreans and Middle Easterners play Ubisoft games.

By now, ""9 to 5"" is just a figure of speech for ""typical full time shifts."" It can also be used to mean ""boring office job"" or the sarcastic ""living the American dream.""","1417392280"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Internet warriors (idiots that don't know what they are talking about) are certainly not unique to Austrian economics.  Take a short trip over to /r/enoughlibertarianspam to see idiots on the opposite side of Austrian theory.  I wouldn't even say it's accurate to claim that Austrians reject empiricism.  They reject empiricism the same way that climate change proponents reject empiricism.  Empirical evidence of snow falling in DC in October does not invalidate the climate change argument.  Proponents are right to reject that empirical evidence.  Climate change is more complex than that, and economics is similarly complex.  Perhaps even more complex.  I think if you read about praxeology and truly tried to understand what Mises and Rothbard actually meant, you'd see that it isn't as ridiculous as the hardcore anti-libertarians make it out to be.

Unfalsifiable claims are also not unique to Austrian economics.  People on all sides hold fundamental assumptions that cannot be proven or disproven.  How would someone go about disproving that the current level of inequality is bad for the economy?  That hasn't even been conclusively proven yet, and yet lots of people still take it as gospel.

I sympathize with people in this situation.  I think everyone is born with one issue or another which affects them adversely all their lives.  I'm for giving support to people who move forward to who they really feel they're supposed to be.  

I just hate to see a big deal made of an issue when, in the long run, the actual people involved are the least affected.

There'll be this big debate between the mayor's side and ""family values"" side, and more feelings will be hurt and more people will be upset...  in the end, the idiots on each side of the issue will just be bigger idiots and even with supportive laws, folks will still do as they've always done.

Adding it to your existing PC yields better performance (as well as [all the other perks of PC](/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/guide)) for $250 *less* than the entry cost of a PS4 or XBox One. This doesn't even factor in *free online* and all the expensive games on console that can be acquired for a fraction of the price (or even free) on PC.

[This](http://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/wiki/builds#wiki_the_next-gen_crusher) is our Next-Gen Crusher. It's an entire list of PC parts that crushes consoles at similar price ranges. It's *even faster* than the first option.

In conclusion, consoles are not only worse, but also more expensive. You're welcome, person who just saved money and improved their quality of life at the same time!

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","&gt; in the ""Fusion Reborn"" movie Frieza died in one hit from Gohan.

Not technically canon to Toriyamas storyline, for all we know the Fusion Reborn never happened on that same timeline.  Broly is the same thing.  So You cannot compare that instance with this movie necessarily, only what's been in the manga/anime (but not the filler).

&gt;How could they explain Frieza gaining so much power in a such a short time?

It is speculated that his remaining henchmen wish him back to life and most likely wish him back to life being ""the strongest being in the universe"", so he will automatically surpass the saiyans and such.  Frieza is also getting another transformation as well which would also explain a power boost considering his race transforms in order for the body to withstand the ki.

&gt;Goku/Bills powers &gt; Shenrons...

Yeah but Shenron uses ""magic"" for a lack of a better term for his powers.  Theres no doubt Goku could turn Shenron into a belt, but Goku cannot bring people back from the dead where Shenron can.  Whose to say Shenron cannot give perpetual power to someone?

&gt;I just can't see Frieza being a main villain

Though I'm not sure either way with this but Toriyama wrote the movie I believe from inspiration from one of Maximum the Hormone's songs which was written and inspired by Frieza.  Therefore it could be very likely Frieza is the main villain.","1417392286"

The four teams in each group play each other in a round robin, and the top two finishers in each group advance to the single-elimination tournament that determines the champion.

The draw is the lottery that determines which team goes where. Generally the teams are broken up into four pots, and each group is made up of one team from each pot. The top seeds are all in one pot and the rest of the teams are grouped by region (European teams, North American and African teams, Asian and South American teams) so that someone like the US doesn't face Mexico in the first round.","1417392286"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","One of my friends was texting me a horror story about one of these as it unfolded.  His friend told him he was getting a gaming PC and upon being asked for the parts, the guy pointed him to this exact model.

So my friend went apeshit in the friendliest manner he could muster and tried to prod at why the guy was getting a prebuilt instead of building his own.  The story went in stages like so:

1) ""I like how this one looks.  This one looks cool!""  So at first my friend looked for cases that looked similar to it but the guy wouldn't budge on his opinion, then I found the *exact case* and showed it to my friend.  This led to the next issue:

2) ""I don't know how to build!""  Unfortunately, this one we couldn't get him to budge on no matter how much we tried to convince him how easy and fun it was, with excuses ranging from ""I'm not a computer science guy like you are!"" to ""I just want to buy it and run it!""  So we offered to build it for him, as well as in front of him so he'd know we didn't do anything wrong.  But THEN:

3)  ""These guys are professionals.  They can do it better than you can.""  This is where I stopped helping because I was genuinely angry and wanted to punch the guy - hard to do that through the phone.  My friend on the other hand first reminded the guy about his own homebuilt rig, which the guy has played on and indeed helped influence him to get a gaming rig.  The guy got defensive in disbelief that my friend actually built the rig (claiming he thought the local computer shop did it).   My friend then told him about how full computers can come up damaged when shipped and started talking about individual part warranties.

Next thing I knew about it was that basically the guy tuned him out and then soon enough, he had his Fiend, complaining about how his Ultimate Gaming Rig wasn't so ultimate.","1417392287"

For example, you could say almost every traditional dragons/castles fantasy novel after LoTR borrows heavily from Tolkien's works, however think about something like Game of Thrones where they take the general fantasy setting and apply a heavy does of realism. GoT builds on the fantasy archetypes created by LoTR, just in the ME builds on the space operas that have come before it. ","1417392291"

AFAIK the only upgrades it had were shit to prevent overheating. Everything else stayed the same.

By the end, you wouldn't have known you were even playing on the same system. I can't imagine what Dark Gods the C64 developers were sacrificing to by 1990, but the Commodore kept pace with everything consoles threw at it until the Sega Genesis came out.

You absolutely have to understand that the oil *will* be moved regardless of a pipeline or not. It's better to not have thousands of trips by tuck/train that give off exhaust and are more likely to have a spill. 

There's also the economic aspect. If the oil is moved by vehicle it will be more expensive to you the consumer. 

60,000 litres is this [much](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yD_68Y4CU1Q/Tl7h4uHchGI/AAAAAAAEZ0k/2MNVWd2NzoY/s1600/5+STAR+CARRIERS+DUBLIN+GEORGIA%252CDominy+Oil+Inc.+International+Tractor+Trailer+Truck+Dublin+GA.+Laurens+County.JPG)  A train carries *way* more. Check [this](http://media.columbian.com/img/croppedphotos/2014/09/30/Oil_Train_Safety_.JPEG-0358.jpg) out.

I am a hobbyist calligrapher, and when I decide to create a piece I often look to music, poetry, quotes etc. for inspiration. Sometimes it can come from the most surprising place.

For those of you who have watched Samurai Champloo through episode 14, you will doubtless be familiar with this [song](https://soundcloud.com/mlc954/ikue-asazaki-obokuri-eeumi) by Japanese folk singer [Ikue Asazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikue_Asazaki). The music is beautiful and once I researched the translation of the lyrics, I felt I had to write them down. This is the result.

For those that are interested in further information, the piece is about 65x35cm and done using gouache on black paper using steel pens and a paintbrush for the title.

Την Κυριακή μάλιστα, επισκέφτηκε τους πρόσφυγες και φάνηκε πρόθυμη να βοηθήσει, αλλά δεν ενέργησε αναλόγως. Αν της δώσουμε μια ισχυρή, λαϊκή εντολή, θα μπορέσει να ξεπεράσει τα γραφειοκρατικά εμπόδια και να βοηθήσει τον Αλί και τους φίλους του.

Μπορεί λοιπόν να βοηθήσει αυτές τις οικογένειες – ας της δείξουμε πόσο δημοφιλής θα ήταν μια τέτοια της κίνηση.

For a hamlet, it's pretty suburban.There's a big highway that separates my hamlet from another, and my apartment is right on it. It's *super* convenient. There's a strip mall right next to me with a supermarket, eye doctor, gym, Japanese place, fabric shop, and a Big Lots. I can walk to it. There's a gas station right there too, but a) it's expensive; and b) it's BP. There's a mall right next to that with a Toys R Us and another supermarket.

On the other side, there's a bowling alley, 2 car dealers right next to each other (I got my car from one), a Ruby Tuesday, a car audio place, a boat dealer, a strip mall with a 7-Eleven, yogurt place, bed store and a couple other things, and a brand-new Target. All that is safer to drive to.

But yeah, I think about moving sometimes...mainly for job purposes. There aren't a lot of apartments that are as new, nice or as convenient as this one and it wouldn't make a lot of sense to move unless I found work in a different area...which I'm really trying to do right now.

Complete nonsense and untrue. So untrue the rumor bothers him.
“If you could, clarify that people aren’t mean to me on the street,” Gleeson says while relaxing between takes on the Thrones set in Belfast. “Nobody’s ever said a mean thing to me. Instead people say,’Are you okay? I hear you get bullied on the street.’ And I say, ‘No! Everybody’s been really nice.'”

The requests became a burden for most police departments and worrisome for police chiefs and the public at large who raised concerns of privacy. “We figured if the sergeant who’s in charge of our video program, if he spent an hour a day, five days a week, we would maybe be able to get this stuff viewed by 2017,” said Police Chief Alan Townsend of the city of Poulsbo. “But the reality is that’s just real-time viewing.

For the capitalist, yeah, being a capitalist is good if the capitalist is successful. Being a capitalist isn't a good thing when your product fails in the market, or you have too many costs so you have to cut down on wages or capital purchases.

For the workers, not so much. They don't have the means to be a capitalist, so they sell out their labor and receive a wage, unrelated to the amount of value they put in to the commodities they produced, that pales in comparison to the capitalists' profit, they get the fruits of their labor stolen from them, and a whole bunch of nasty stuff along with the good.

If you want to get really general and talk about capitalism as a whole, there are some good things, but there are also major drawbacks.

It entirely depends on my mood, but mostly I do make people laugh and shite.  It's weird, I find it *real* easy to do, but others seem to have difficulty with it?  I dunno, that boggles me.  But what do I know.

*Alsooooooooooo*, I more have the thought: ""Her handbag really matches her shoes but I don't want her to think I'm hitting on her so I won't actually say anything but *hot damn, Mama!* That outfit!"" But never actually say anything.

And feel free to take a guess at where I'm from or request me to say shite, I'm bored enough with nothing to do!

Hope you are having a wonderful evening yourself; do nowt exciting for your weekend?

I get the size difference, but IMO, that makes wrapping even more important.  I really see it a lot when a DB is covering a pass in the flat, especially behind the line - they run in, arms crossed and hope to hit 'em into next week.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","This study asks women what their ""expectations"" are when they're between 17-25 and then goes on to say that their expectations aren't met. And their expectations are that the men they marry will want to ""balance"" home and career the same way they intend to. Well, so what?

I think what happens is that when people get older and into the workforce, what they find is that the demands of business are that people who *really* want to get ahead at work (and not simply wish to) have to sacrifice family life, to some degree, to make that happen. Men have been doing that for as long as anyone can determine.

You know what's a simple solution? Ambitious women should marry men who are less ambitious and capable in the business world than they, who would like to make family their number one priority, the same way men often do; or they should simply shut up. But neither of those two things is ever likely to happen.

Instead, we as a society are supposed to *hobble our productivity* by demanding that ""everyone"" (which, when it comes right down to it, will still mean *women only*) be able to take time away from work or work flex time, and still climb the ladder of success.

I'm agreed with what pretty much everyone else here is saying.

**Suicide is definitely not an option.** The situation sucks, for sure. But look at it this way: You've learned a valuable lesson! Next time, maybe be a little more picky about who you decide to date, and maybe don't push for long-distance relationships.

This chick sounds absolutely horrible. If anything, you should be glad that you found out. You've just pulled a Neo. You've dodged a bullet. The longer this went on, the worse it would've been. Be glad you found out and got out when you did. First, get control of yourself, and then this is what I would do in your shoes...

1) Dump her, in person. Act fed up and disgusted with her (shouldn't be hard at this point). Cite personal reasons like hygiene, physical appearance, her command of the English language, her taste in the arts, anything. You are the bigger and better person here. Her being a cheating slut will be her frosting on the shit cake she's made for herself. Whether she wants to or not, she's going to take these things that you dislike about her to heart. And - all on her own - she's going to add to that ""cheating, unfaithful slut"" and feel even worse.

2) Keep Yourself Busy Find other things to do, like getting a second job - which will put you into new social circles, and give you some extra cash on the side - or, if you already make enough money, then volunteer somewhere. Either way, you're inserting yourself into new social circles which will give you the opportunity to make some new friends - which is what you arguably need right now, more so than a new relationship.

3) Move on. If you find yourself thinking about her, you're not busy enough. Find something else to occupy your mind. Be active. Hit the gym. Nothing says ""Fuck you"" better than getting in awesome shape, making new friends, and being able to demonstrate the insane up-turn your life has taken since leaving the slutty bitch you dated a lifetime ago.

Good luck to you!","1417392321"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Please don't suggest that GNOME is ""resisting"". If you want support for something and the maintenance effort is ok, then it'll be merged. However, if you think that GNOME ever supported sysvinit then you're a little bit uneducated in the matter IMO.

GNOME still supports ConsoleKit. Without some systemd API's (logind) the featureset is way less (not good enough for Debian). If a distribution (Devuan) wants not to handle systemd at all, then it could add back e.g. standby support and maintain it themselves. It has to be a distribution decision due to other parts of the stack not playing well with runtime (polkit). As Devuan is not intending to support systemd that seems easy to do.

Actually taking up development responsibility is important though. Code won't be maintained out of an ideology. Share the effort between upstream and downstream.

Reading the mailing list it is mostly about ""hate"". Devuan development is done on a mailing list called ""dng"". This stands for ""Debian not GNOME"". There's talk about removing anything which requires systemd. Likely they won't ever look detailed enough at the situation and just remove GNOME.

GNOME has decided on a hard systemd dependency various years ago. It was a no go. I find it curious that so many people make it out to be different. Systemd provides some stuff that's useful. That we rely upon simply because it does stuff that is useful. From all the API's provided only logind API was not meant to be used or kept separate from systemd. This was overlooked while GNOME release team was deciding on it.","1417392322"

"chelseafc","t5_2rsl6","The second photograph clearly shows Costa's shirt being pulled. I don't care how much its impeding him, a decade ago that would've been an automatic yellow.

In the fourth picture I don't understand where you are seeing the defender's arm go over Costa when his right arm is clearly grabbing Costa in the armpit/chest section (note the shirt creases), and his left arm is on its way to doing the same, although that is debatable. Either way, the fact that his right arm his grabbing Costa is sufficient proof to understand what the defender was trying to do there.

&gt; On top of that the ref did a fairly good job and wasn't at fault for our loss.

Firstly, we didn't lose the match. Secondly, I never said he was at fault for the result. That point wasn't even up for discussion. But to suggest the ref had a good game is being dishonest. It took him 75 minutes to show Sunderland their first yellow, and it took an obvious horrendous tackle from behind for him do that. Rodwell and Johnson kept fouling us on the counter and they were never booked for it. He missed Costa's kick for which he should've been sent off. He booked Costa for an accidental contact because he knew he'd fucked up earlier + got pressured by the surrounding players and the crowd. No control over what the players were doing in the box from corners and on one instance actually called for a foul whilst Cahill was being grabbed and thrown to the ground by O'Shea. He may not be at fault for the performance we put in, but he sure as hell made things a lot easier for Sunderland.","1417392323"

And even though Brees threw a terrific game, holistically, the Saints's passing offense just isn't as great this year as in prior seasons. Something isn't clicking for the team as in prior years. Not sure what at this point. We'll likely have to think about it over the post-season.

But Graham is still Brees's favorite target. Any owner would be foolish to sit Graham in any game, period. Fantasy is a game of averages, and eventually even someone like Graham will get blanked. Sometimes even more than once per season.","1417392327"

It was hardly valid for twenty-four hours.  Olmert was in power until **MARCH 31st 2009**.  In July 30th, early on in the talks, he told Abbas he wouldn't be seeking another term and that he would not be running in the September Kadima primaries.  When the September primaries occurred he didn't win, Tzipi Livni did, BECAUSE HE DIDN'T RUN as he'd told Abbas long before then would be the case.  But that was not the end of Olmert's reign (and for that matter, his replacement who would go on to run the party was Tzipi Livni -- his chief negotiator in the talks).

Abbas still had six months to accept the offer, but he didn't.  He decided to play politics and hope that after the upcoming election he could squeeze a deal out of the new Israeli government that would be 1% better.  As I said, it was the mistake of a generation.","1417392327"

&gt;__Ikue Asazaki (朝崎郁恵, *Asazaki Ikue* ?)__ (born 11 November 1935) is a Japanese [folk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_music) singer from [Kagoshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagoshima). She was born in Kedomi, [Amami Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amami_Islands). She grew up on the Amami Islands (in [Setouchi, Kagoshima](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setouchi,_Kagoshima)) which are famous for spawning popular singers of [shima-uta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shima-uta), Amami's traditional music genre. Her father influenced her early music strongly during her upbringing.  Her musical style sometimes resembles the style of [New Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Age). Her most famous albums are *Utabautayun* with traditional Amami songs and lyrics, and *Minya*, with Akira Takahashi accompanying her on the piano.

I've met many CCNA's, CISSP's, MCSE's etc that couldn't talk the talk or walk the walk.  It was aggravating.  If you're going to pursue a cert, that's great I don't discourage you, and chances are you will not understand everything you're learning, and thats fine too.  Knowledge and application come with experience.  Give yourself time, Rome was not built in a day, and your interests will change too.  I started out in Web Development - LAMP environments and I thought that is what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. 12 years later, I'm a high-level network engineer with a focus on security and optimization, and to get to here, I did all kinds of crazy shit: IS auditing/assurance/governance, white-hat hacking, compliance, network admin, traveled the world... life will lead you in crazy directions man.

One thing that the XL has going for it is that it is more portable than the 2DS. If you're playing it at home, it isn't a big deal. However, you may miss out on StreetPasses.

Despite that, the 2DS would definitely be more than adequate for your needs. If you can afford to do so later, you can upgrade to an XL or a New 3DS.","1417392329"

Yeah yeah, if they didn't break the law, the tax dollars wouldn't be wasted, but there shouldn't be a law in the first place, and I think that should invoke the bigger outrage.

It's just a matter of which is worse - breaking an unjust law, or enforcing one?  Yeah, it's bad to break the law even if it's unjust, but it's even worse to spend money enforcing a law that is unjust, at least in my opinion.  After all, even if no one actually broke the law, there would still be money spent enforcing it.  You wouldn't know no one was smoking weed unless you were paying for crackdowns and raids, right?  Even if every one turned up empty-handed, you'd have to keep having the raids to make sure no one was breaking the law in the first place.","1417392331"

"hinduism","t5_2qifc","I found this article to be unnecessarily combative and un-charitable to Gaudiya Vaisnavism (GV). Maybe this is why it doesn't accurately represent the GV perspective on these questions. The article states it is only addressing the philosophical position of Iskcon, but many of the points made apply to all GV. 

It also suggests the GV philosophy is obscure ...

""The philosophical position of ISKCON vis-a-vis other feuding Gaudiya denominations is unclear due to differences among the different groups themselves, as well as a lack of clarity in the doctrines, compared with Dvaita, which is a well-defined system.""

So not only is our philosophy obscure (unlike Dvaita), apparently we're all feuding with one another, and this is why the authors were unable to determine exactly what GV philosophy has to say on the matter. But this is hardly a valid excuse for the lack of understanding of GV apparent in this article. 


For example, they suggest the divinity of Chaitanya Mahaprahbu is ""peculiar"" to Iskcon when this would be something we could say defines GV. They also suggest this divinity is based on an interpretation of one Bhagavata text when GV's have given a comprehensive list of scriptural justifications for identifying Chaitanya as the yuga-avatar.

They also suggest we give ""supreme"" authority to Bhagavata Purana as an axiomatic truth. Not only do we recognise the authority of all Vedic scriptures, we don't just assert the authority of Bhagavata Purana, Jiva Goswami has given comprehensive justifications for this in his Sat Sandharba.

If anyone would like to read the GV perspective on these questions you can find a list of articles relevant to all these points on the gosai website [here](http://gosai.com/writings/tattvavada-gaudiya-siddhanta)

"portugal","t5_2qmie","Sim, li.

Eu concordo contigo que a proposta não está formulada correctamente para um proposta de lei. O artigo 1 está quase ao nível de generalidade de um artigo constitucional, e a proposta não especifica quase nada de como será implementada.

No entanto, discordo com a tua afirmação que ser um direito implica que possa ser usado sem limite. Qualquer direito requer uma perda de liberdade (e.g. direito a viver =&gt; é proibido matar, direito à propriedade privada =&gt; é proibido roubar, direito à água =&gt; é proibido acabar com ela). ""Adequado"" é definido pela lei, como tudo.

A questão ideológica é se esta liberdade deve ser restringida pelo estado (i.e. regulando o preço da água/racionando) ou pelo mercado (i.e. menos água para a mesma procura =&gt; aumento do preço =&gt; perda de liberdade no seu uso.)

Vou assumir que concordamos que estamos a falar de o estado garantir esse direito. (i.e. vamos largar a ideia de Laissez-faire).

A questão política que a proposta aborda é se o estado deve garantir o direito controlando os meios de produção, ou se deve apenas regular o mercado para garantir esse direito, como tem feito.

Eu vejo o uso da água como uma taxa não progressiva. Isto é, o que pagamos por ela não depende dos nossos rendimentos, e todos usamos mais ou menos a mesma quantidade. Se o estado controlar os meios de produção, existe a opção de ela passar a ser uma taxa progressiva (por impostos).

A minha posição, e ai demarco-me do PSD/CDS, é que social democracia requer uma equidade de rendimentos superior à que temos hoje em Portugal. Nesse sentido, acho que é perigoso liberalizar o mercado da água pois estamos a falar de uma taxa não progressiva.

No entanto, a menos que o preço da água dispare, estamos a falar de um valor ainda relativamente baixo no rendimento familiar, quando comparado e.g. com a alimentação. Assim, não acho escandaloso o mercado ser regulado. Há coisas mais importantes para nos preocuparmos.

P.S. Continuas a ter uma atitude pouco simpática (e.g. ""eu, tu, o teu primo, o cão e a avó""). Não basta teres argumentos para conversar comigo. Queres discutir, tem mais cuidado como expões o que queres dizer.","1417392334"
"Warframe","t5_2urg0","I didn't even start the grind. Once I got Alad V's new boss fight blueprint and realized that his coordinates only drop from invasions, I dropped all hope of playing to acquire her. No reason to even start.

For starters, I was upset that I'd be waiting around and twiddling my thumbs until DE decided to grace us with an Invasion. I was annoyed that I'd have to run it three times to get a single coordinate. I was even more annoyed that I needed three coordinates, meaning I'd be running at least *nine* missions across three invasions. All that for *one* chance at *one* fight for *one* piece.

So that's 9 invasion runs for key 1, 9 invasion runs for key 2, 9 invasion runs for key 3, and then three Alad V runs. That's a whopping 30 missions *bare minimum*. If RNGesus frowns upon you, then you could be staring at a fractal keyfarming nightmare.

So I said ""fuck it"", bought the Gift Pack at sale price on Steam and ponied up the dough for the new Warframe. I still haven't seen the new Vay Hek, and I'm not going to see the new Alad V any time soon. I may be MR16, but there is *no fucking way* DE is going to get me to grind to such a disheartening degree. If this is indicative of the direction Warframe acquisition is headed, then you can count me out of  future Warframes. I actually quite liked the new Quest-based acquisition, this release really feels like a step backward.

That said, Mesa is a fantastic Warframe that I *really* enjoy playing with. I daresay she's one of my favorites, presenting a challenging yet rewarding playstyle that oozes ""cool"". As annoyed as I am by the grind surrounding her and Alad V, I really couldn't be more satisfied with my purchase.","1417392334"

"dogs","t5_2qhhk","I took home my male doberman puppy when he was 8 weeks old and he is now a year old. As a puppy, my doberman Saber was extremely fearful in new places and around new people. So much so that he would cower and urinate if a new person so much as even looked at him. Once I was walking into the vet's office with him and a big dog was standing at the counter, and just at seeing the dog, Saber let out the most horrifying scream and immediately urinated. At first I was very unsure about this behavior but after many emails and phone calls with the breeder, I was assured that is totally normal for the breed and you just have to socialize it out of them. So I took him everywhere I possibly could - every pet store in town got to know us well and I took him on car rides to all my family/friends houses and also on many walks to get used to cars and the sounds of outdoors. We also became regulars at the local dog park. Thankfully, my efforts at socializing him has paid off and he now is a social butterfly, although still protective around the house. 

So the take-away if you do plan on getting a dobie is SOCIALIZE, SOCIALIZE, SOCIALIZE! It's important for every puppy but this breed in particular seem to need it even more. It's my theory that the super aggressive, nasty junkyard dog reputation the breed has comes form poorly socialized dobermans who turn their fear that was never trained out of them into aggression.

Suggestions – 

Lose “Muggers?” at the end of Ray’s second line. The foreshadowing is unnecessary and ruins the surprise.

Ray and Nick don’t need to comment on the action, on the mugger being blind, on the deaf guys being deaf, on the cripples being crippled… This is a very visually funny concept and the commentating Ray and Nick do is unnecessary and mutes the humor. The commentating and exposition will definitely mute the humor of the scene once it’s filmed. And you should sure as shit film this.

Same as above with COP 1. He doesn't need to explain to us he’s blind – “Well I can’t really see…”. It will be obvious to the viewer. COP 2 (through the translator) doesn’t need to tell us he’s deaf. You need to show us he’s deaf.

You might consider pulling back on the Ray and Nick parts of the sketch.  I know it’s douchey to take the “What I would do” route, but what I would do is -- Keep Ray and Nick at the beginning. Keep the gag where they record the fight on their phones. Keep them at the end. Lose their exposition and commentary. Lose their dialogue on pages 4 and 5. 

Do you have other sketches you'd be willing to share? This one is fantastic!

""White Heroin"" is almost certainly fentanyl adsorbed onto lactose or some other filler and will have no taste (except sweet etc from the filler) because the dose is so small. Cocaine has the numbing thing but also has a very characteristic ""green"" taste that's hard to describe. Depending on the quality and area, it may also still have a residual solvent/petrol/gasoline smell from the extraction process. Cocaine purchased in Panama, for example, is often uncut and is potent enough that a line is way way too much, so even if you know its cocaine, its never safe to do a line of anything right out of the gate. 

*Test-bumps (~50mg)* should be safe for 99% of powdered drugs sold on any street (unless its pure heroin, and you're opiate naive, but in this case the dealer would KNOW it was uncut and you'd be paying a premium for it... you'd also probably have a tolerance enough that the 50 mg bump would still be safe)","1417392339"

The only reason people agree that he is cheating is ""because there's like 40 instances of him aim locking"". For one, there's only about 15. For two, only ~two of those 15 are sketchy.

Everyone is stuck on this ""aimlock through walls to learn players' positions"", but that argument has many holes in it--why does he only use it once per game, why does the bot aim at random players instead of nearest enemy or nearest-to-crosshair, why does it only aim at the hitbox 10% of the time and outside the hitbox the other 90%, if it's coded so smart to not aim directly at the head or chest every time but to randomize the position that it aims at why is it coded so dumb to lock onto players that are 90+ degrees away from the current crosshair position, and etc...

Flusha very well may be using a very hard to detect aimbot that only improves his aim 10-20% -- http://gfycat.com/UncommonLightheartedEagle#?speed.. is very much evidence for that. But it's the *only* evidence for that, and it stands out completely from the other ~15 gifs.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I went and looked at the source and it was interesting. One thing I noted though was that it was a timed period of one hour, against one cigarette. This was measured against somebody vaping for an hour. How in the world is that comparable? At the least I would average 1+ cigarettes an hour, and considering my smoking wasn't a ""whenever"" thing, but whenever I had time, I usually chained two or three at a time. My vaping follows a similar pattern, I don't vape constantly for an hour, I'll take a couple hits, then put it down, sometime later I'll take a couple more. There are times, just as with cigarettes, I'll go hours without.  If anything, the 5 minute results are what should be compared, so that you're dealing with comparable usage. If I have my math right, that means with the e-cig (keeping in mind it's 18mg) that the ecig delivers about 1/3 the level of nicotine. I'm vaping at 12mg, so that's what? About 1/4? And I vape at 5.2w not 9. Way too many variables to draw any certain conclusions beyond the fact that I am getting significantly less nicotine than when I was smoking.

They're also the ones that most routinely scapegoat the fact that they don't have very good positions and aren't very good at explaining the ones they have on an evil and pervasive conspiracy by philosophy.

[Take one look at this beauty](http://www.reddit.com/r/badphilosophy/comments/2mvf69/the_evolution_of_social_justice_orthodoxy/) and tell me it's not a desperately bad position trying to pass itself off as philosophical.

&gt;No, I just want you to be honest about that fact that it's not exactly all inclusive. We've been over murray but wasn't twinklebells also constantly shat on by naejard and then didn't he leave because queerbees and completely-ineffable kept harassing him? He didn't even identify as an MRA.

So? There's a lot of things that Naejard ""yells"" at me about, and I'll just yell back. Then people upvote me if I'm explaining it well. He also yells at /u/queerbees and /u/completely-ineffable from time to time.

&gt;He didn't even identify as an MRA.

He identified himself as one at one point.

Genesis 38 New International Version (NIV)

Judah and Tamar
38 At that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to stay with a man of Adullam named Hirah. 2 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her and made love to her; 3 she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, who was named Er. 4 She conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 5 She gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Kezib that she gave birth to him.

6 Judah got a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar. 7 But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death.

8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Sleep with your brother’s wife and fulfill your duty to her as a brother-in-law to raise up offspring for your brother.” 9 But Onan knew that the child would not be his; so whenever he slept with his brother’s wife, he spilled his semen on the ground to keep from providing offspring for his brother. 10 What he did was wicked in the Lord’s sight; so the Lord put him to death also.","1417392352"

"feminineboys","t5_2vmuo","So I'm 22, and haven't had too much experience in dating but I'll share. 

My first serious relationship (2 years) I came out to her a couple months in but I hadn't figured it out myself, but I told her and she wanted to be supportive. She did my makeup and let me present the next day and told me she accepted me for who I was but did not encourage it at all. She told me she was straight and attracted to masculinity (which is fair). Our relationship ended that being one of the factors but there were many others- we weren't right for eachother. 

For the next couple months I got back into cross dressing, started painting my toes, and reading about genderqueer ness online. later I decided to come out to all my friends and it was awesome. The college town I'm in is pretty liberal, I found a group I could go to queer night at a local bar with and I found that in full girl mode a lot of queer-ish chicks were in to me, a lot of them androgynous presenting which I find hot, or just drunk straight girls at a gay bar..I was going through a just broke up phase so Made out with various girls (and some guys) last summer.

In September I met a girl (online..on tinder) and told her a couple weeks in bc doing my gender expression right is all that's keeping me sane   And Halloween was coming up... she was completely cool with it, no qualms at all. It gives me good space to explore my fem side, just paint m nails wear makeup mix and match guy and girl stuff. She likes the panties a lot...Last week I bought us both matching lingerie it was the hottest thing ever. 

On the other hand because I'm new to relationships and insecure about people In general accepting this part of me I can feel myself staying cause it's comfortable and because she finds me hot in a femboy way, not because we have good compatibility","1417392354"

"AirForce","t5_2roa2","Please reformat this to make a more complete argument. Unfortunately you're all over the map here.

&gt;Instead of stopping pay raises a better option would be to better use the money given.

Ok, let's have some examples.

&gt;We could save billions if we sat out cost-of-living increases for 5-10 years, but that only hurts service members.

It doesn't *only* hurt servicemembers. The ones that got force shaped so we could keep our sub 2% annual pay increase would say that it would help service members. Additionally, what's wrong with all of us having to tighten our belts a bit? We're all pretty well paid.

&gt;Look at the cost of beef over the last 5 years. Prices are going up and in some areas the cost of living isn't bad. In others if service members lost their yearly increase they would be effectively taking a pay cut.

The annual pay increase I'm discussing is mostly concerning inflation (which yes big picture affects cost-of-living). I'm not discussing BAH. In effect we can get TWO counters against inflation: BAH recalculation and the yearly pay increase. This solidifies my argument. As for servicemembers effectively taking a pay cut, well, yes. When a business is struggling, a natural course of action is to cut wages and/or benefits. We're struggling right now.

&gt;Single Airman don't get Family Sep, so they aren't compensated for being away from family.

That's... sort of the point. If you don't have dependents, you're not separated from them. Should I get Family Sep because I'm thousands of miles away from my parents?

&gt;Agreed that some civilians aren't adequately compensated, but that doesn't mean service members should take pay cuts.

We're looking at a drastic future. To maintain the ability to effectively wage war, many, many things have to be cut. I'm saying servicemember's pay (a HUGE portion of the budget) shouldn't be off the table. I'm not saying it should be the only thing, there's tons of room for improvement, but many, many things have to change. There was a Major finance guy floating around here awhile back talking about how they were running budget sims at the Pentagon and even a 10% cut was just brutal... we're facing a time of brutal options.

Would you accept a 10% paycut to save your job, or your friends job, or your mission? I sure as hell would.","1417392355"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Coinbase vault has a 48 hour delay and requires multiple email account confirmations.

In theory, if your security is compromised, you should be able to stop an outgoing conbase vault transfer before the funds leave the vault.

If your security is compromised with an electrum wallet, the coins are instantly transferred to the thief's address and there is no stopping the transfer.

I'm NOT saying that coinbase vault is superior to a properly managed secure wallet like Electrum where YOU own the keys.

But I do feel its probably the most secure storage method where the coins are not directly in your possession (but since it supports multisig, you CAN keep control even when coinbase has your coins in its vault).

Note that the coinbase wallet does not have these additional security measures.  The Vault is for people who want more security and don't mind having the 48 hour delay on outbound transfers.

Coinbase also keeps 97% of all coins in secure cold storage and their hot wallet is insured, so they are leading the industry in terms of coin storage.","1417392356"

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","Hey,
I'm about one month in after quitting (daily for about four years). Just like to congratulate on making the decision to quit this is the first step and you should be proud of yourself (don't reward yourself with a bowl =P). As with any addiction (if you'd like to call it that) it is way easier to just smoke up again, but in the long term it is not worth it. 

Smoking daily, in my opinion is like sweeping the problems in life under the rug. When you are high your emotions aren't normal, they are a lot more smooth or kid friendly. The first few days are hard because your brain is trying to get used to the normal thoughts and feelings you have, they have been suppressed by dope for the past ten years (they might feel emphasized because they have been toned down for so long). You just have to keep in mind that this will eventually go away or balance itself out and your brain will rewire itself to deal with your problems in a sober state. Life always brings ups and downs and if you are up all the time you don't necessarily have to deal with the natural lows that everyone has, this is what will make you feel shitty for the first little bit. it definitely gets better from here on out, you will feel more real, have more energy and you will be more linked to the world and the things you do in life will feel more fulfilling.  

IT WILL GET BETTER, as harsh as it might seem you just gotta tough it out. Just look into your future and how much better it would be without weed. Because you smoke weed, it is probably safe to conclude that you enjoy self fulfillment, you have to replace that need with something else (working out, a productive hobby, improving your relationships, extra work on your career, all of these make you feel good about yourself without the mask of weed). Your girlfriend doesn't like it either, there is one right there. Do you want kids? if so then do you want to tell them that you smoked weed a lot when you were younger and tell them it is not worth the money/energy? Or do you want to be the father that still smokes weed and seems not to be engaged in their upbringing and doesn't realize that it may be a problem. 

Sorry if that sounded mean but a bit of tough love is what I needed to quit. You can be so much better than the person you currently are without dope. Do you know anyone who has said, ""man I'm so glad I smoked weed for x years of my life it really helped me become more productive""? Good luck to you good sir don't give up on trying to quit.

She is unfriendly in that she is agressive if I try to put her more than maybe a few scratches on the head when she eats.

If she is sitting/laying in your way, she will attack you, she will not move such as when my dog moves.

I do see what I'm doing is very unfair... I am so at the end of my rope though, I have no idea what to do. I feel like she is miserable here and afraid. 

In the basement I give her plenty of boxes to hide in and blankets.

I change her litter very often, and to compensate for the area she is pooping on the floor I got a second box. I use worlds best cat litter because it tracks less than clay litter (it's the basement so it doesn't reallyyyy matter) and it clumps well, and I know that the particles in clay litter can be bad for kitties breathing heatlth.

I try to get other people like my husband to give her wet cat food and treats, and other people when they are over. But most people know she is agressive and won't try to help. ","1417392360"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","It's an emergency when you don't have the money, but you *need* to spend the money to:

- Avoid losing more money or destroying your finances (e.g., leak in the roof, minimum debt payments).
- It's a safety issue (I think your case applies).
- Basic needs (food, shelter, warmth, medicine, etc.).

Given low little savings you have, I suppose only question is really whether or not you need to drive the car (e.g., do you have other ways of getting around), but it sounds like a reasonable use of your emergency fund.

Shop around.

P.S. As with most common questions, this is answered in the FAQ.  See the Emergency Funds section linked by AutoModerator.  The first question is almost word-for-word your question.

P.P.S. Turning on the air conditioner (not to a cold temperature, obviously) can actually help remove moisture from the air and help avoid fogging the windows, but I wouldn't recommend it if it's below freezing.  Turning off recirculation, cleaning your windows, and warming up your car can also help.","1417392361"

Только тут врывается УК - по хорошей половине статей основания для ареста гораздо более зыбкие, чем предлагаемые этим законом. Возьмем банальное убийство - как можно гарантированно установить, что подсудимый убил жертву? Оружие можно подбросить, видео - сфабриковать, свидетелей купить. Но как то же выносят приговоры, и автор их не критикует.

That the Francis Underwoods and the Walter Whites of their respective fictional universes get a pass for that reason. That notion is apologetic, PC bullshit.  
Those characters mentioned by name are people we love to hate. They do deplorable things, but they act within their own framework. Walter White for example, only has his world come crashing down around him when he loses control of the violence he has put out into the world and it spills over to directly affect people other than the other villains he chooses to interact with.  
The main protagonists in Attack the Block are chavs. I call them that because they choose to, and are shown to, put violence out into the world non-discriminantly and are proud of it. That is why viewers have trouble fully investing a positive outcome for them.

&gt;

&gt;__Metagaming__ is any strategy, action or method used in a game which transcends a prescribed ruleset, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game. Another definition refers to the game universe outside of the game itself.

&gt;In simple terms, it is the use of out-of-game information or resources to affect one's in-game decisions.

However, the bottom line is there is no true scotsman. Just think of Sunnis are ""more traditional"" while the Shiites are more on interpreting the Quran in ways that Sunnis don't agree with.

libertarianism, and free market capitalism are not new ideas; why have they not flourished already ?

&gt; If I recall correctly, we've already had this argument, and as I recall it's clear that you have no ""evidence"" or ""sociological and economic analysis"", just buzzwords and baseless assertions. 

Its not buzzwords. in short: in a given socio-technological and memetic framework, the societies that exist are precisely the fittest. Ergo, naziism is the strongest society given the current memes and techs. In order to change the equilibrium, we will need new meme's and new technologies.

Agorism is not new, its older than the whisky rebellion. Its called private commerce.

Seasteading is not far from the pirates of yore, and equally vulnerable.

And armed resistance is older than spartacus. 

I dont think we will get the results we need with old ideas. Hell, the only reason these acts have gained any traction at all I suspect is internet communication.

The bundy ranch is not safe because of armed resistance. I suspect it is only under reprive because the nazis regime has learned how to better manage the media since waco and ruby ridge.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","It's funny and frustrating how much playstyles vary on this hero. I mean, I never know what the hell the Techies on the enemy team is gonna do because if he's bad he will be unpredictable and if he's good he'll be unpredictable.

Whatever.

My build is tango + 3 clarities + mantle + circlet. I buy Null + Bottle + Soulring ASAP and go straight for Aghs. You didn't talk about your skill build but I usually max suicide 2nd and ignore stun mines until later on.

As for why I get a null... Dropping the item + using bottle + soulring is enough mana. I think arcanes are a waste unless you're literally shitting mines everywhere.

Why do I go for Aghs first? The damage on it is retarded, saves me a ton of time placing bombs once you have it, allows you to farm way faster and combines with your dropping items strat to get quite a bit of mana. (btw my friend once picked it up as ogre, couldn't drop it, fuck)

When i go force first I don't feel like I get a lot out of it. I mean, the pushing people into mines thing is cool but honestly if the enemy knows about it they won't fall as easily and even then it's pretty hard sometimes given how randomly people move in Dota. I fail to forcestaff someone and I just wasted 2k gold and delayed my aghs.

I don't buy a TP. I simply buy very fast and walk to the offlane. I plant mines on the jungle entrance. I don't really care if they see me placing the 3rd mine before creeps arrive to the lane. My idea is: if they know there's mines they'll have a harder time harassing me from the trees, if they don't I'll get a kill. This allows me to harass and fight the enemy dual lane quite well. It's pretty impressive how far 4 tangoes go when you have 7 fucking armour.

I barely use Q mines past the laning stage. If i have a regen I'll place them or if there's a Huskar in the game and I feel like gambling for a kill. They are so unreliable... I mean, you can get kills but they make you spend more time than needed placing mines because you always wanna put more just in case someone survives. Because that's the thing. The damage is so random sometimes one dude walks over 6 mines and survives and you're like WELP FUCK ME. If I use remote mines I can check whether or not it's worth blowing them up and since Techies doesn't require too much attention around itself to play you can stare at the minimap 99% of the time and manually blow up all of your traps. I always ctrl+click my traps and control group them. I try to have 3-4 max so I can better keep an eye on them and make sure there's enough damage to kill someone. I feel like spreading the mines too much will make you annoying but get no kills(or no exp because of the time used). So yeah Q mines I feel like they are the poor man's remotes for whoever can't actually have even the slightest amount of map awareness.

Now, I don't play perfect. I am a lazy Techies player. If I'm winning by a lot I tend to sit back and place mines because it's fun. I should push with my team and win. [It's cost me a few games...](http://www.dotabuff.com/matches/1045397400) But honestly my winrateis still 60%, down from 70% which I kept for some time, and I have a ton of fun anyway.

____

A couple of things for new techie players:

* One mistake I make sometimes is trying to box mines to quickly blow them up and accidentally select my hero with them. This makes pressing Q useless since it'll try to place a mine instead. It's cost me a few kills.

* Chrono stops your mines from exploding, but if you explode them they'll blow up when the chrono ends. Think about it before pressing the button. However, you can explode them remotely using Techies. If you get chrono'd on top of your mines... you're done.

* If there's invis heroes you can place one regular mine on top of remotes. If you see one explode quickly blow the rest of the trap. You can also stack red mines instead but, as I said, I think they suck dick.

* Remotes can be used as wards. Not so much since last nerf but they're still good.

* Red mines block jungle camps, green ones don't.

* Suicide has a pretty big AoE. If you really want that one lasthit on the enemy before he escapes it can be worth it. Just learn how much damage you actually deal.

* If the enemy has a gem, there's a ton of spots inside the trees which allow you to get kills anyway. I specially love the trees on the right of the Radiant mid T2 tower. I think the best way is to go on a lobby and simply place mines around the map and learn new spots.

* There's a spot in the roshan entrance which gives vision inside and outside the pit, yet mines can't be sen even with a gem from outside(I think they're also hidden from inside, depending on where you stand). I can't take a screenshot right now but I could if you guys want, tomorrow.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Marxists inaccurately equate social privilege and rank with capital accumulation itself.

We do live in a ""mixed"" society, where there is still embedded privilege, and a social aristocracy.  It is important to not conflate this phenomenon with the exercise of the free market.  I am not defending our current society, I am defending the voluntary aspects of it.

I hate to have to do this, but: imagine ten farmers.  One learns how to tie tremendously good knots.  These knots are so useful, they save each farmer an hour of retying their hoes each day.  Up until this point, all property was common, because each farmer produced just about the same amount of food.  Now, the knot guy decides to demand a little extra from the storehouse in exchange for his knots.

He doesn't use violence to get it.  There's no state-enforced privilege.  There's no village elder, urban army, priest class, feudal soldiers, or anything to make the farmers do this.  The knot guy does not possess social privilege.

However, he does possess natural privilege.  He was ""born"" with the knot tying ability, let's say.  Do the farmers have a right to deny his request?  Yes!!

But let's say they figure that with the added time for farming each day from the knots, they can afford to give knot guy extra food and still have extra food leftover from the ""knot surplus"" for themselves.

They would probably agree to the deal.

THIS IS HOW PRIVATE PROPERTY NORMS GET ESTABLISHED IN LIBERAL CAPITALISM.

Now, let's say the farmers got together and said, ""This isn't fair, he was born to tie knots and we weren't.  We all work equally hard, we should all share.""

They then tell this to the knot guy.  He says, ""Well, that's fine, I think I'll just farm like you guys then, and not tie knots.""  At this point the farmers steal knot guy's daughter and promise to rape and torture her each day he doesn't tie knots.

THIS IS THE SOCIALIST FORMULATION OF LABOR AND PROPERTY.

Private property is not using the sword to maintain privilege.  Private property can exist by the sword, or it can exist in a free market.

This is a distinction you need to understand, but obviously don't because you're obsessed with you justice crusade against the privileged elite.","1417392372"

The trouble with places like London and Bradford isn't that people have a different skin colour, it's that they are changing the attitude of those areas into one that is at odds with the rest of the country, they contest, rather than enhance, the culture of the area.

I know that immigration from the Commonwealth after the war (e.g. Afro-Carribean) was far from peaceful and perfect, but I can't help but think they tried to assimilate a little bit more, they kept their own cultures, but not in the way we are seeing today. Then again, maybe people back than just didn't but up with it so forced them to adapt. 

I don't give a flying fuck what peoples skin colours are, I care about their attitudes, and think we as a country need to face up to the fact that some cultures have issues that need to be dealt with (FGM, arranged marriage, paedophillia) and that perhaps some are just not suitable to be allowed into he country.

Kpop was making some waves there when I went. This was in early 2013, so I still heard Gangnam Style a lot, but other acts were getting attention as well. I didn't live in Buenos Aires, but the city I lived in had a bunch of fanclubs for a lot of different groups. When I scored a cheap ticket to a Super Junior concert, I ended up going with some fans to Buenos Aires to see them.

The concert was a bit of a big deal because it was the first one to be held by a kpop act in Argentina. It made the papers (one of them [here](http://imgur.com/9XJygU6)) and was talked about on talk shows. MBC even made a documentary about it, which I appeared in for about one second.

It was fun for my first concert, but I don't think I could do it again. The line went for blocks and blocks and blocks!

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","&gt; Make a 1st amendment issue out of a ball hat?

They didn't make it an issue. You have that backwards.

&gt; Civilized behavior makes for better discourse.

The first amendment allows us to express ourselves. What the city council did completely goes against a peaceful assembly. You don't get to pick and choose who is and who isn't civilized. Sorry!

&gt; If you'd just complied with common courtesy, you'd have been welcome to express yourself at the microphone.

And if they realized that that person could wear whatever he wants due to the constitution, there wouldn't be a problem.

&gt; You might make your point more impactful and more cerebral by avoiding phrases like ""fuckin"" and ""shitty public comment period"".

Maybe. Maybe not. Doesn't matter. 1st amendment. Sorry!

&gt; Hat guy, you did nobody any favors by being such a self important douchebag.

The entire room of citizens was in agreement with the 'douchebag'. 

&gt; Way to make sure the cops get more overtime pay on your own dime.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Early in the solar system, before the planets formed, the sun basically had ""rings"" similar to saturn. These ""rings"" are called a protoplanetary disk. This big disk has to rotate in one direction. If part of it rotated in the opposite direction, it would collide with the other parts of the disk and eventually one direction would win. The planets that form from the gas and dust in this disk are going to orbit in the same direction as the disk.

The gas and dust collapse into a single disk for similar reasons. If you had two disks of gas and dust, they would swirl together where they meet, and eventually merge into a single disk.

A sufficiently advanced civilization could construct a solar system with planets orbiting on different planes or in different directions, but it would be unlikely to develop naturally. Also, I don't know what kind of orbital instabilities might happen long term if you had things orbiting in weird directions.","1417392380"

If they tapped a camera that tags me, I want to be able to know able it.  

We are the ones paying for it, and the surveillance is only going to get more comprehensive as technology catches up. The onus is on them to make that data accessible to us. If they want to use it as proof against us then they need to be able to make the information available. And if they can't put these place safeguards on tools used to surveil against us and they shouldn't use them. And if they want to use them they need to be accountable for their use.

"textventures","t5_2yax9","""I'd be happy to,"" responds Cecil, and a cacophony of ""yes"" and ""of course"" follow from the remainder of the group.

""Wonderful!"" Elizabeth says with a grin, ""And yes, of course we'll allow your people to hang onto their weapons. I'm sure any of us would want to do the same in your situation. Alright, We're gonna take, I'm so sorry, I don't know all your names. The order is going to be the older gentleman first, then the younger man who is not Gerald, followed by you with brown hair, young lady, next will be the, er, sorry, Japanese? I want to say Japanese, I'm not trying to come across as racist, girl. Gerald, you will be last, just as protocol, we've always interviewed the leaders last."" She begins to point towards certain people, signalling for her men and women to take them to different spots to wait. ""Jake, you take him, Alex, her, Megan you can take her, and Doug, you take Gerald. We'll get through you guys as quickly as possible."" Elizabeth leads Cecil into the hardware stores.

The man who's name you now know to be Doug leads you to the lower story of a building near the hardware store. You enter a former coffee shop, and he tells you to just take a seat on one of the couches, and make yourself comfortable. He takes a chair and sits near you. You two exchange idle pleasantries, and make casual small talk. He tells you he was actually a barista in the cafe you are sitting in. Place was called Kaffeine, one of those trendy places. It has great couches, and that's where he likes to take people he's escorting here to relax. After no more than forty five minutes, Elizabeth's voice pours through a radio attached to one of Doug's belt loops, and tells him to show you to her office.

""He walks you through the hardware store, which is mostly dark, except for some emergency lights, until you reach an office back in the ""Employees Only"" Area. The office has a warm feel, and it actually looks just like one of the rooms a job interview would be held in. Elizabeth gestures for you to sit down in a comfortable looking, red chair. Doug walks out of the room, and leaves you alone with the leader of the Colony.

""Well, Gerald, I'll say that your people all seem wonderful. Everyone's stories matched up completely, and I'm sorry to hear about Cecil's leg. I'm sure it will heal in no time. Anyway, I understand you are actually relatively new to their group. I can tell you have an innate ability to lead. You've obviously done this group numerous great services already, and I'm sure you will continue too. Natalie, you know, she's rather fond of you, I can tell. I mean, they all are, but she sang such high praise of you. Sorry, sorry, I'm prying. Ah, it's just my husband, he was always so...so clueless. I guess it's just a product of all my time dealing with that,"" She says with a chuckle, before staring off at something you cannot see, and sighing. ""Sorry, back to this,"" She says, focusing on you once again. ""Give me an abridged version of, well, everything that's happened since people started dropping like flies.""","1417392382"

Imagine you had a business in an office building, and you rented one of the office suites.  While the building owner has relatively little to do with your success -- most of that comes from what you said: skills, luck, work, etc.  However, they provided you with the **platform** on which to build your success.  And you entered into an agreement with them to pay rent.  Do you feel like it's fair to skip out on that rent?

That's essentially the agreement within a country.  You build your business in the country, you pay taxes to that country.  On the whole, you are certainly responsible for your own success (or demise), but being in a country where that is possible shouldn't be understated. ","1417392384"

The higher that number the thinner the lenses. You may sacrifice optical performance though on something that high of an index. Seiko is a lens manufacturer who in my experience does very well with high plus prescriptions like yours. Honestly I would look into contacts if you haven't already.

A lot of people will buy a pro controller while they wait for the adapter to arrive. The longer the shortage last, the longer people will get fed up with gamepad and go buy a pro controller. Since there is no way to prove nintendo intention, they get recognition for doing the fan service of releasing an adapter and get more money by selling more pro controller.

- Iran could end this war tomorrow by offering to scrap any nuclear weapons program, patch up ties with Israel, and make any aid to Assad conditional on a comprehensive human rights audit.

Intangibles are code for bullshit.  The only thing that matters is ability.  Quarterbacks are leaders only in so-much as the confidence they give their teammates.  Look at Aaron Rodgers or Russell Wilson.  Plenty of their teammates absolutely hate them as people, but they're still winning games and superbowls, not because of bullshit intangibles or ""leadership,"" but because of skill.  There is no difference in Peyton or RG3 calling out their team when it comes to ""leadership.""  

Btw, Mark Sanchez had the exact same ""intangible"" problems in NYC that RG3 is having in Washington.   You're making RG3 sound like the devil.  Skill-aside, he's had the exact same problems as just about every quarterback in that's ever existed.  You won't find many quarterbacks that have never said something stupid in a post-game press conference. 

If you don't think RG3 simply doesn't have the skills anymore and Chip can't rescue it, then fine.  That's a fair argument.

My mates are renting a full house two blocks away from UOFA for almost 2500 a mont, utilities not included. So it can be a bit difficult in that sense.

If your SO works at the UOFA then southside would be the best option,
Old Strathcona, Allendale, Garneau, Queen Alexandra, ETC
ALTHOUGH finding a house to rent that is animal friendly that isn't a student rental dive is pretty rare.
LRT is great here in Edmonton, heavily used by all students and workers alike.
Find out more about the LRT cost, locations, etc on the Edmonton website.

Shaw seems to be king out here for internet and TV providers.


And for the weather, Its not terrible, once you experience one YEG winter its all gravy. yesterday was -37, with 26km winds. 

I am originally from Kootenays/Vancouver I miss the warm interior winters, blanketed with heavy fluffy snow. =D
Here its basically like a wintery desert sitting a -25 on average.

"GameDeals","t5_2qwx3","&gt; I've heard nothing but good stuff about it

Want to hear some bad stuff about it?

* You get too much money; If you never sell items in the US, you still have enough money to buy every item you want.
* If you only use the Canadough you make in Canada (including selling stuff), you still have enough money to buy every item you want there.
* The level cap is kinda low, i think i hit it before Canada.
* There are some minor mistakes, like the placement of some Fast Travel Points, the arrow-firing tutorial (walk the other way and you miss it) and the location of the hobo camp (too easy to miss).
* Lots of backtracking because you get new abilities that allow you to get past obstacles.
* The classes feel kinda samey. You get a useless attack that is annoying to use, a stun, a power-up, etc. I always ended up using the same 2 attacks.
* Going first in a battle gives too much of an advantage.
* The NPC-switching system seems to point to having a party of three at some point, but they forgot to unimplement NPC selection when they stuck with a party of 2.
* Some of the humor is rather dated. An Inconvenient Truth was released **8 years ago**.
* Too much 'dirty' humor, not even satire or social/political commentary.

Aside from that, i think Stick of Truth has four major flaws:

**Difficulty**

It is far too easy, even on the highest difficulty. On Normal i forgot to even change my outfit. I only just remembered you can get Jesus and some others to help you, i never used them.

**Lack of balance**

Some of the clothing/weapon mods are too disproportionally useful compared to the others. The first playthrough i also missed out on the most powerful one (+1 attack for weapon), which seems like bad design. Also, Kyle is OP as hell, even if you fail his sequence.

**Controls**

The PC port is pretty terrible. They could easily have assigned the various farts and teleports/arrows to number keys, but instead they force you to use the terrible scrolling system.

Even worse is how the key sequences only show WASD. When i play a game, those aren't WASD, they're up/right/down/left. They should've shown both or given an option. Also, having the goth dance sequence use the actual arrow keys was fucking stupid.

**Blocking/Attacking timing**

First of all, you should know that SoT is an adaption of DoubleFine's Costume Quest (i actually played SoT first). In that game you play kids dressing up in costumes, beating monsters, getting upgrades, etc. SoT vastly improved on Costume Quest, for instance by having more than two attacks and even being slightly harder (lol).

Buuuut, they fucked up when it came to combat. In Costume Quest they show a warning in the middle of the screen when to press a button to perform a special attack or to block. For the latter, SoT shows a small ring around the feet of your characters. This has the unintentional result that you miss the often amusing and elaborate attack sequences of the enemy because your eyes are glued to your characters' shoes. That's some bad design, guys.
_____

Other than that, SoT is great. It looks, sounds and feels exactly like South Park should. It's often hilariously absurd and can get away with stuff that no other game could. You can go to any toilet to get a turd that provides an actual benefit in combat, how great is that? It's amazing how much of the series they managed to put in, even stuff going all the way back to 1x01.

If you like South Park you should definitely get it. When it hits 10 bucks. :P","1417392390"

Even further, you could also argue that allowing immigration of Mexican farm workers has drastically slowed technological innovation. Because immigrant labor is so cheap, there is no need to develop technological solutions to fruit-picking or so on.

"wiiu","t5_2sjnz","MK8 is a relatively simple game for netplay.   Lag, at worst, only causes visual distractions 90% of the time.  There's almost never any important difference between playing with people beside you or playing with people online, except that you can't make fun of each other as effectively.  I don't remember ever having disconnections but I've got a decent internet connection.

SSB is much less forgiving of lag.  It's still playable if there's a bit of lag but it's not comparable to sitting next to someone.  After 5 games or so I started adapting to the lag and found it enjoyable again.  It helped to play with a slower character for a few rounds so I didn't need pinpoint timing.  I think playing SSB with net lag might have actually improved my offline game.

If you're having a better online experience with SSB than with MK8 I'm not sure what the reason would be.  Maybe they licensed some lag compensation middleware or something?","1417392395"

So... the fact that something is not demonstrated to be impossible does mean it is impossible?
That does not make any sense. 

&gt; Something cannot come into existence without cause, whether it is re-arranged from existing matter or not.

The causal principle enjoys experiential support. We know of no exception to the causal principle. Why shouldn't we be impressed with this evidence? What reason is there to think that the universe is an exception to the causal principle?

&gt; If it didn't begin to exist then it can have no cause without violating the first premise.

Agree, somewhat sloppy of me. Nevertheless, the Second Law of Thermodynamics predicts that in a finite amount of time, the universe will grind down to a cold, dark, dilute, and lifeless state. But if it has already existed for infinite time, the universe should now be in such a desolate condition.

"Femdom","t5_2qyib","Hi there!

My ex and I had a femdom relationship for a little over two years.
We met in high school, but didn't really hang out until college.  We were vanilla at first, then I started sharing some of my fantasies with her.

Eventually, we created and signed a chastity contract. Chastity was one of my favorite parts of the femdom qualities.  If you look in my posting history, you can read the entire contract.  To me, it was perfect; and I'm really struggling with moving on and accepting that all of that is in the past.  The best sex of my life is a tie between two moments.  One, when she had kept me locked in chastity for over a week and teased me nearly everyday.  She finally unlocked me, climbed on top of me, and I exploded inside her.  Two, once she kept me in chastity and made me wear a HUGE buttplug to the movies.  When we got home, she stripped me of my clothes, bent me over, and fucked me like she's never fucked me before with her strap-on.  That was the only time that I've been fucked with a strap-on while still in the cage.  It was like an ultimate fantasy come true for me to feel her pounding me and be unable to cum or even grow.  She had full control.  Those are the two best sexual moments of my life so far.  Hopefully, there will be more to come with whoever lies in store for me down the road.  Hope that was what you were looking for :)","1417392396"

That's the thing.  You have to care about yourself more than you care about her.  There will always be another girl.

&gt; It would certainly be a lot easier. I can recommend the book sex at dawn and the authors podcast, they give a rational and open minded perspective about these things. 

I think it's definitely based on what your core values are as to what you will make of other people's opinion.  

I would rather she is honest with me, if anything.  It's just harder to go from an exclusive relationship, back to non exclusive LDR, back to exclusive again (especially if you are still in an LDR).

Whatever the case may be, it's best not to think of what other guys she's meeting.  Being outcome based means that you see the results of the actions and not so much the actions themselves.  Let's say she is cheating on you.  Would you hate yourself for not knowing?  Noone should ever blame themself for being cheated on.  I mean, how would you know if it wasn't obvious?

What you need to pick up on is her being aloof or distant for seemingly no reason.  If she does fall for some other guy or is just playing the field while using you for favors, there will be a genuine lack of interest.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","Because we as the audience get a first hand look a much of Voldemort's life away from Harry.  Everything from Tom Riddle to the pensieve flashbacks to the chapters with Nagani.  In many fans' opinions those pages were a waste of time and space since they didn't actually reveal anything about the guy we couldn't tell from the rest of the book.

It's like, if you want to make a 2 dimensional character a villain, that's perfectly okay to do, it's a regular practice in most literature.  But if you're going to try to round out the villain with extra information, then I'd hope you actually tell us something that rounds him out, that makes him at least partially understandable, or we're left feeling completely empty what that character is going through.  If the reader doesn't actually have to think before they decide between Harry and Voldemort then learning more about Voldey's backstory to doesn't really add much to the character, the plot, or anything else.","1417392401"

6 And God said, ""Let there be League of Legends,"" and there was League of Legends. He saw that it was good, and he distinguished the Bronzes from the Unranked. 7 But God saw the community was selfish and compassionate, so He separated the Forums from /r/LeagueofLegends, the Second Day. 8 And God saw this was very good.

"mycology","t5_2qu6q","Just posted looking for the 3 types of polypore mushrooms mentioned. 
the big commercial mushroom houses  do not seem to carry polypores. 

but, one can buy the red reishi he mentioned online, in the form of tiny inoculated wooden dowels.   

to grow your own mushrooms from plugs, you simply drill a holes in a log, and hammer the dowels in, and seal them with wax. 

reishi prefers oak, maple or elm logs.

there are specific patterns (diamonds, 6 inches tall, by 4 inches wide) that you use to get full coverage of a log, and larger logs need dozens of plugs, but the basic process is quite easy, there's just a lot of repetition. 

some species can also be grown on sawdust, and grain, and with a bit of reading, it's not hard to pick up the skillset. 
(these techniques work for edible mushrooms too. Try Oysters. they're a good place for a beginner to start.) ","1417392406"

Protecting the best interests of a certain group of people isn't morality. Morality principles concerning the distinction between right and wrong or good and bad behavior. 

You could argue, for example, that a carbon tax is based at least partially in morality, but no one who has to pay it will ever live long enough to see its benefits.

In fact, a lot of tax law is completely amoral. Import taxes can cripple another country's economy and have often been legislated to do just that. ","1417392407"

So, yes.  In this community, saying things along the lines of, ""I really wish I knew a trusted source."" is analogous to ""source trolling.""  It's inviting people to send you source information via a public channel in the community.

"bicycling","t5_2qi0s","Max amount of spacers under the stem is around 40mm in most carbon forks. This bike looks to have at least 50mm of spacers. [Specialized specifically states a max of 40mm](http://service.specialized.com/collateral/ownersguide/new/assets/pdf/Fork---Carbon-Road-Fork-Instruction-Guide.pdf) for their forks. This is because the steer tube is not designed for loading that far from the bearings. The chance of failure is greatly increased and a broken steer tube is not going to be a nice crash. 

The other issue with this setup is the large amount of spacers on top of the stem. This provides a nice convenient way injure yourself in a crash/or going over a pothole.

The third issue which we can't see here but I suspect is an issue is the placement of the expansion plug. It should line up with where the stem is so it can support the clamping force on the steerer tube. I suspect is way up high in the steerer tube because otherwise this bike would need a gigantic bolt to preload the headset. ","1417392413"

- Rescues that were obvious animal hoarding cases and had all the same dogs for 9+ months and none of them got adopted out
- Any rescue where I couldn't meet the dog before taking it home (we have several that pull dogs from shelters in the south and foster them in the south, and then transport)
- That one weird rescue with the insanely invasive adoption application that they would only accept via fax between 4pm and 8pm on weekdays, because if you're that weird and controlling with the application I don't want to know how weird and controlling you are about everything else

Other than that I was willing to try to work with them if they were willing to try to work with me. I ended up getting my dog from a crappy underfunded municipal shelter and they didn't do a home check OR check references, and the way they checked whether my apartment allowed dogs was asking me if I'd asked my landlord and believing me when I said yes. For all they know I could have taken him home and cooked and eaten him.

Mario, metroid and castlevania are the platform genre holy trinity. 

I'm currently replaying them all! 

There's about 25 in total I think. 

The main story line takes place over the all but the Lords of shadow games. 

Like the Mario games, the story is ridiculous but it's the game play that makes them. 

Have a look at the wiki page on castlevania for the release time line. 

There's 4 nes games, one msx2 game, one X6800 game, 2 snes games, one megadrive game, one pc engine game, 3 gameboy games, 3 gameboy advance games, 3 Nintendo DS games, two PlayStation games, one psp game. 

Those are all the classic story / universes in 2d.

There's 2 ps2 games, one n64, one xbox, and 3 pc games in 3d.

( I might be missing a few there, but I'm only replaying the 2D games myself) 
The 3D games look awful in comparison to the 2D ones.

"occult","t5_2qhmc","I am so glad I don't pay a fortune to be educated by these imbeciles. I'd rather go to the University (Concordia) that hosts Fantasia Festival every year. LOL... ""in the brain's gray matter""... 8 weeks of weak sauce meditation... 10 days of meditation recommended me by Khmer buddhinduists would accomplish more , quickly.. but not even as fast as the simile of the bath attendant. the 10 days are a formality.

[Nang Nak -- Buddhism! -- ""Meditation"" -- Simile of the Bath-Attendant -- sexy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yh6pDjqncQc)

[Initial D - season 1, episode 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hfXHiydW16E) ... I'm more partial to the more Buddhist side of Khmer religion but I respect the eclectic pool of what is available to me personally to learn (I go to a Wat). / just think ""Middle Way"" when you watch this and what the lyrics , the art, the tone is saying, about light , darkness, contrast.. the needle on the odometer being a tell tale sign. Those are not Nikes but New Balance. anyway... its comical once you ""get it"". that's... the joke... Safety in lies, truth is empty? the Vimuttimagga... blah blah. I get it. 

Meditation is fine as a practice as a discipline however for people new to meditation it is important to understand to distinguish what your goal of meditation is. 

I'll give an example, from **Buddhist scholarship**, here's the situation, -- **Haunting the Buddha** by Robert De Caroli 

You go to a temple to meditate. There are other meditators there who have already reached particular states. Some of the meditators are also venerating their ancestors.. and adopting lost souls of the wilderness, such as in a conflict zone, like Vietnam, or Cambodia... some of those people, and the very goal of their meditation, both traditionally and by happenstance, involved being possessed. Now, those people have long noses, as opposed to short... they feel their breath at their nostrils as opposed to their upper lip. ... Proposition. The only way for you to reach a breakthrough meditating is to get possessed, too. That is why you are there. However.. culturally.. the traditional way of introducing new meditators, is they don't tell you. this is what they do instead. this cultural perspective fyi is insane in the modern era.  

Analogy -- Buddha tells a story. In the story he says... there is a burning house. there are children playing in the house and they don't see the flames . the buddha tells them that if they come out, there will be a chariot, pulled by horses, waiting for them. the children come out to see buddha. when they arrive, he is there to embrace them. a gift more precious than any chariot. 

After you reach your breakthrough -- , the analogy reads... Buddha is inside a buddhist temple, but you would never enter a haunted house, that would be like walking into a burning building. you were already outside, and now you're inflamed. 

^ that is Buddhism. but in order for Harvard medical students to know the joke -- which everyone knows the answer to if you read scholarship about it. they would have to walk into a burning , haunted , house. 

the other half of the analogy is that the texts that Buddhists used to teach meditators were frequently burned, because a lot of people didn't find the joke very funny. but that is the fault of how buddhism is taught, and studied, not the fault of the people, or the fault of what they are doing. in S.Korea, people know that to marry a shaman is bad luck (and, well, deadly). shamanism is oppressed, historically, but the people also value the shamans. it's a delicate issue.

there was a schism, that happened in buddhism... the purpose of buddhism... is to reach a breakthrough. the buddhist tradition did this through initiating people as shamans. but not everyone wants to be a shaman. so... the monks remain in the tradition, and they don't teach the people, because they think that they will get too scared (see the burning monastery, library of alexandria, etc example)... but... the people... they're in great distress about this, because they need to adopt lost souls, to appease the well being of the community, and they can't, because not everyone wants to be a monk, in robes... etc

This is Affirmative Action as it relates to securing gov't contracts. All evidence, proven over and over, shows reality is the opposite.  I even know black men who've legally changed their names to sound white on paper just to get a job.  Also, college-aged women are often ignored while they're in their child-bearing years.

I think the songwriting is great! Really nice sound and good vibe. The arrangement is cool, too, with the oohs and aahs in the background.

I think, though, that the performance could be tighter. Especially the vocals. Sometimes the drums and vocals were really off.

The production wasn't bad, but I think the vocals could have been processed a bit better. What are you mixing in? I think even some simple EQ, compression, and reverb or delay could get things sitting a lot better.

I'd recommend getting it mixed by somebody who really knows what they're doing. And maybe, before that, take a few more cracks at the vocal. It's already a great song and it has huge potential to be a really great track.

EDIT: after a second listen, I really like the track. I'd like to take a crack at mixing it. PM me if you're interested.","1417392425"

"sydney","t5_2qkob","I think there's some serious misunderstandings about what TPG is doing and how it's being done that I'd like to take a few minutes to clarify. 

Firstly, there have been promises of high-speed broadband now for +5 years and there is still minimal access to the govt's network; so, if an established telco such as TPG/PIPE Networks already has thousands of km's of active fibre in close to proximity to apartment buildings and has the ability to provide a fast &amp; affordable broadband service then why shouldn't they do so? Especially when it's both cost &amp; obligation free!

And before any fingers are pointed about TPG ""cherry-picking"", how many people know they're offering these FTTB installations at NO-charge to buildings with as few as 10-units...it's not just the high density properties but many of the small &amp; medium ones as well. That's not cherry-picking - that's private enterprise doing it's best to be as all-encompassing as possible.

Another relevant point that's being overlooked is that TPG is not asking for any form of exclusivity or monopoly for a property - with a number of buildings already hosting both TPG's FTTB and the NBN Co's FTTP. Also, TPG is NOT forcing any resident to connect to the FTTB equipment...there's nothing they're doing that obligates people to change from their current service provider if they don't want to. TPG's FTTB is an additional service providing residents with another choice without any effect the status quo of the current Internet connections.

And finally, it needs to be understood that the ""LAAN"" being used to contact targeted buildings is a document specifically mandated by Federal govt legislation for use by ALL licensed telecommunications carriers/service providers when they want/need to access a building. Commercial buildings have been seeing &amp; dealing with these notices for years without any problems, but because they're new to the residential marketplace they're being demonised as a bulldozer.

Yes - a LAAN is a cold document, but honestly, there are few govt documents that aren't...and there are contact details on every LAAN to connect property representatives with people at TPG who will respond, discuss &amp; negotiate with any person that raises questions and/or concerns about the FTTB project.","1417392427"

I think that most character nerfs don't serve to make the character directly worse, but rather require the players to use more strategy/creativity in their gameplay. In my opinion, players should be rewarded for going for cool, creative combos rather than sticking with the tried and true. When the obvious option is the best option, it becomes less fun and rewarding.
&gt; Most of Link's changes since PM 2.0 have been nerfs, and I've felt good about just about all of them. It could partially be my bias as a low-tier main in Melee, but I really enjoy the feel of every option being a commitment, forcing the player to be really smart about what they throw out there. From a competitive player's standpoint, it feels pretty crappy when your character gets a nerf because you feel like you, as a player, were just made worse due to factors beyond your control. That's an unfortunate feeling that can't be rectified, but I think nerfs can be very important for the long-term meta of the game.


Perfect response in my opinion. Thanks for all the work you do, especially that flash on l-cancel.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt;To me, this comes off as similar to people's ""Not All Men!"" reactions. Yes, the person knows not all men (do X), but SOME men (do X), in fact enough men (do X) that it requires calling out. As I am not a man who (does X), I understand that the statement is not about me, and so have no reason to get upset.

Allow me to reframe your point to illustrate why I don't agree with what you said here. Suppose someone made a sweeping generalization about, say, homosexuals. Do you think it would be reasonable for others who don't conform to the generalization to be upset and speak out against the claim? Same thing with race, with gender, with religion, with any other trait or label under the sun.

Just as it would be unfair to make claims about blacks based on the few who are criminals, unfair to make claims about women based on the few who are superficial, unfair to make claims about Muslims based on the few who are extremists, it's unfair to make claims about gamers based on the few who act badly. Not to mention the label ""gamer"" is much more poorly-defined. I think it's absolutely reasonable and indeed morally obligatory for other gamers, even those who aren't bad actors, to stand up and reject the claim, doubly so when it's a member of the press making it.

&gt;You have to also understand that Leigh's article was coming on the back of a week where ZQ and AS were forced from their homes, a streamer was SWATed on stream, and the SOE president's plane was diverted for a bomb threat. In other words, it was a week in which ""gamers"" - the ones she was writing about - were acting awfully.

I can understand that those were emotional times for Alexander, but that's no excuse to publish an article like this. It's utterly unprofessional.

&gt;But above all, I think you're making one major fallacy: You're assuming that the people who write these things aren't nerds, either. Sam Biddle wrote Valleywag for months; someone that embedded in Silicon Valley news and culture has likely lived and breathed 'nerd' for years. Every games site I've ever worked at was crewed to the brim with nerds, with introverts, with people who preferred to interact with the world online than in real life.

Being a nerd or gamer doesn't give them leeway to attack the group as a whole.","1417392430"

&gt; It is impossible to completely answer this kind of question.

Why?

&gt; My understanding of it is that he can't interact as fully with the sinful world without destroying it.

Why?

&gt; Another possibility is that we are simply expected to figure a lot of it out ourselves, so that we grow.

Why.... Joking! Joking! In all seriousness though, if my children grew in a way that I didn't think was right I would tell them. Does God do something similar?

&gt; A child may also say ""why?"" to their parent, but they don't really want an answer.

If my children ask ""why?"" it is mostly because they simply want an answer, and I think sometimes they get a buzz out of seeing me struggle to give an answer! 😉

&gt; But I suspect you aren't really sincere in your questions...

If you have perceived that then I am sorry, it was not my intention at all. I do genuinely want to understand why, if God does exist, he would choose what I consider a flawed method for communicating with us?

Without that narrative, none of the known facts are weird or tie Adnan to the crime in any way.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","A few weeks ago at the start of a session, I had one of my players (an elf druid) find himself situated in a dark forest, unable to see the sun's rise, as leaves covered the sky above them (I had him come up with an environment, and this was what he thought of). He found himself alongside one of the other player's characters (dragonborn monk), and they'd stand there in silence for a while.

They'd suddenly hear moaning and growling from afar, and they'd ready their weapons as they looked around, trying to figure out where the noise came from. After a few minutes, they could finally see what was hiding in the darkness, coming closer to them. Ghouls and ghasts.

The fight was glorious, but it'd end with the player coming to terms with losing his beloved druid. When he failed his third saving throw, I asked him: ""How'd you picture your character die? Does he have any last words?""

The player gave off an incredible prayer to his character's deity, at peace, being one with nature once again. And he'd have his character turn to wood, petrified.

""You wake up, panting and drenched in sweat,"" I said. I had given clues through the whole thing that it might just be a dream, but the player was so engaged he didn't notice. I had him come up with the area, and how he'd picture his character die, but he didn't really register it as something going on within the character's mind.

This is how, as a DM, I had my first PC die. Although not for real, it really did feel like it for my player.","1417392437"

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","Except you're wrong and objectively speaking having a cursor to select targets is objectively better than shit tab targeting the controller has. Sorry but no the game is not objectively better with a controller. Trying to say the controller is objectively better is laughable, and just sounds like you're trying to defend your choice. By all means use a controller. It isn't in any way ""objectively better"". Just because you prefer it doesn't make it better. 

I can make KB+M look better too though. 

* Better camera and movement control
* Quicker reaction speed 
* Superior hotkeys for abilities with again quicker reaction speed
* Separate buttons for interacting and jumping 
* Better looting due to previous superior controls. Mouse allows the game to know exactly what you're trying to do and the f key not being jump allows for less failed looting attempts.
* Far more flexibility with keys that can be customized to your liking
* Much better UI manipulation and when you want to open something like your map or inventory it isn't thrown behind that shitty star selections screen. 

Now I'm not saying KB+M is objectively better. I'm just saying that it's easy to argue that it is and you could probably argue that a controller is. It doesn't matter though, because it's the individuals values that tell them what's important. Personally I tried the controller and found it awful, but that's usually the case for most games people claim are better with a controller. KB+M is just a much smoother experience for me with keyboard interaction being worlds ahead of controller interaction. ","1417392442"

"food","t5_2qh55","I have eaten a variety of bugs. The background is that I am a herpetologist and as such we use an absolute ton of feeder insects every single day (as in thousands/day) and it was part of a challenge that we all did for charity (how to cook a 5 course meal using bugs!). The insects were pre-killed and then cooked, not eaten raw/live as you see in some challenges.

Locusts - They secrete this gooey black liquid from their mouths that is not yummy so don't suck on them head first. They have a lot of juice in them and don't really taste very strongly, perhaps a little bit like prawns? I found it quite mild and sweet. Not an unpleasant taste. We also dipped them in honey and they tasted like honey so I imagine they would simply add protein to a meal if you were cooking them in something stronger flavoured.


Crickets - Crickets are kinda crunchy. I did not like them at all because of the texture. They have slightly barbed legs and I felt like I had insect parts in my mouth forever. Nothing like getting a leg stuck between your teeth. Taste wise there's a slight nutty flavour. I think they would be quite nice if you knew to remove the legs first!


Mealworms - Soft, slightly mushy, not very strong flavour. Again I'd say slightly nutty if anything. Mush them all together in blender or something, cook them up and I think you'd have something not unlike peanut butter.


Waxworms -  Really crunchy when cooked despite being so soft and gooey when raw. The whole ""tastes like chicken"" thing springs to mind here because they just had a bland, crunchy meat texture.


Cockroaches - Yup, we tried these too. Not the cockroaches you get in the USA but 3 different species of tropical roach that are raised as feeder food for lizards in the UK. They tasted horrible. Really horrible. Really strong and bitter taste and had a sticky goo in them that I don't even want to know what it was. Do not recommend.


Overall I would say do not eat cockroaches but the rest of the insects bred for the food industry (usually the reptile / pet trade) are actually quite tasty once you can get over the stigma of eating them and the gross factor. I definitely wouldn't eat them raw or alive, but they were honestly surprisingly edible when cooked.","1417392442"

I abuse filters and folders. I have four root folders: Automated, Projects, Non-work, and inbox. Each of those has sub-folders as necessary. My inbox and root project folders are for active todos, everything else gets filed away into a subfolder

&gt; * How to keep track of projects?

I've been on three projects over my time. Each one had a project manager who kept track of the overall details

&gt; * How to keep track of tasks?

Each project used a task tracking system (like JIRA or Trac). Just logged stuff here and let the system do its thing

&gt; * Organize meeting notes/general notebook

I don't take notes. Haven't found it to be necessary yet (if something is important, I'll either create a task or email. Notes, if they are ever taken, are disposed of once the email/task is created)

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","It spreads to party members during battle if they are adjacent to a pokerus infected pokemon. Generally, one in slot 2 and another in slot 5 will infect your entire party in a few battles. It makes it so it gains double the amount of EVs it obtains from the moment of infection onward. Keep at least one pokerus pokemon in your PC to prolong the effects though multiple is advised, especially on pokemon you don't plan to bring in your party. They last around I think 48 hours but the countdown is frozen when they're in the PC. There's a thing about pokerus having different strains like real life viruses and depending on the strain it'll last either longer or shorter. Either way, any pokemon infected with pokerus that is in your party and not in the PC or Daycare by midnight will be cured of it. The pokemon will then have a pink smiley face to indicate it was cured. The cured pokemon will still retain its ability to gain double EVs but it can no longer spread nor contract pokerus.","1417392454"

If BP and many other energy companies (e.g., Exxon, Koch Industries and others) didn't want their disasters to happen, they wouldn't behave recklessly, gut regulations designed to prevent/penalize those disasters or pay an army of attorneys, government shills and PR experts to protect their hides before and after they screw up.  Sorry, but the energy industry's history does not substantiate the trustworthiness you're attempting to give the untrustworthy.

I'm fairly certain that the reason we don't have raids is because Gumi's servers cant handle it right now - we saw that with all the recent connection errors. Gumi knows we want raid and I'm sure they're working on it. They want to keep their fans happy to make money, it's not like they're withholding raid for shits and giggles. 

Until we get raid, Gumi has to keep releasing new content so that veteran players keep playing. It's been hit and miss - TOTG was well received, halloweeen/ultor was not. Yes it's fair to complain about lack of raid/thunder arena, but I don't think the hate is warranted. At least Gumi is making an effort - I know there are a lot of other companies that would have done a lot worse.","1417392460"

There really isn't anything that is easily done that people couldn't just buy themselves if they wanted to bring their pet anywhere they go. You can go out and buy a harness right now that says your dog is a service animal. All more regulation would do is cause more of a burden on people who actually need the service animal so I'm not sure what the best solution would be. That is a problem with regulation in everything though. 

I'm not even sure if it is worth regulating more, it is currently a minority of people that do it just to have their pet everywhere they go.","1417392461"

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","To give an example on the other end of the spectrum, I'm Filipino-American, and a family friend of my parents (white guy) married a girl from the Philippines about 25 years ago. The girl was easily an LA 9, and now some 25 years later or so, she is honestly still a very attractive lady. 

Anyway, they stayed together for quite a few years (I'd guess around 8) and had a child, but eventually the wife became very Americanized. She developed a taste for all the things you'd expect from a upper middle class housewife, which were far out of the husbands financial situation. Plus, she was smokin hot and he was a very plain guy. She eventually left her husband for another man. She's still with that guy, and the husband is still occasionally going to the PI to hook up with local girls.

This is not to disparage either of them. They were really not compatible and would never have been together if not for the whole marriage situation. Filipino religious standards and morals are all very relative, and no one should expect to get a grateful and permanently loyal wife by marrying them out of their country.","1417392461"

In the late 19th- early 20th centuries, football was a generic term for ballgames played on foot, including British football, American football and rugby. American football became more popular in America so we retained the name while your football retained the name in G.B.

 [**Koh**](https://avatar.wikia.com/wiki/Koh): [](#sfw) 

---
&gt;
&gt;Koh was born to the Mother of Faces thousands of years before the Hundred Year War. He chose the name Koh for himself after becoming distanced from his mother. 
&gt;When Ummi and Avatar Kuruk were getting married, Koh lured Ummi to the Spirit World, where he stole her face and trapped her forever as punishment for Kuruk's arrogant ways.  Kuruk was determined to end Koh's life, but when the two met, the past Avatar could not go through with it as he realized that bringing an end to the spirit would also destroy the love of his life.  Despite Kuruk's vindictive actions, Koh himself held no personal grudge against Aang, as he was a different incarnation of the Avatar. 
&gt;During the Hundred Year War, Koh stole the face of a young Northern Water Tribe citizen, Rafa, though Koh's mother later gave the young man a new face.

For example: u always flip the coin with tails upside, and flip it with the same exact power from ur thumb move... The RNG of getting 22 heads in a row isn't the same at all. (its not 50/50.. it now depend on the ability to be consistent and the more u are, the closer to 100%/0% u get).

- Since you aren't too much into overclocking, you don't need a high end liquid cooling solution. The Hyper 212 EVO will allow you to experiment with overclocking a bit and doesn't cost too much. If you want to have the cool aesthetic factor associated with liquid cooling, then go with a more modest solution such as the Corsair H60.

- I gave you cheaper RAM. It's slightly slower and looks uglier, but the performance difference will really be negligible. You can usually find kits similar to yours for around $150.

- Better SSD.

- Downgraded the GPU to a GTX 970 since the performance difference isn't that big in comparison to the GTX 980 and you'll save quite a bit of money. If you want, you can always add a second GTX 970 down the line or of course you can stick with your choice.

- Rosewill Capstone 750 as the PSU. High enough quality and enough wattage to handle SLI GTX 970s with a modest overclock on the CPU.","1417392469"

Spock's message of cultural reunification applied to the Romulan *people,* not the Romulan Star Empire, who opposed him.  The soup vendor across the street from Pardek's house doesn't oppress Remans, and neither do the hippie kids he was hanging out with in the basement.  Do you know anyone from China?  They love American TV and entertainment, and many of the younger people love Americans.  They aren't responsible for their government's abuses of Human rights, and neither are the Romulan people necessarily  responsible for the actions of their government.

&gt;What would the reaction of the federation at large be if they suddenly gained an ally with an operating and brutal system of slavery? 

The Klingons aren't nice, either.  But the Prime Directive is a thing, and political stability and peace in the Quadrant is more important than policing the galaxy and interfering in other nations' internal matters.","1417392469"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","1. Sexism (and etc.) for artistic reasons is fine. *Especially* in the case of going from 0 to 1 voices for that subgroup. You must think we're all mad!

2. Nope. (But I'm not looking for anything past what you've brought here.)

3. Fail state is a band-aid for lack of meaningful choices. A game that relies on fail states is technical and ideal for fair competition. In the case of a game that is so complex that manipulating the outcome is a (finely-tuned) challenge in itself, in which case the fail state is unnecessary because players will not have the same end state. No reason you can't use both, though. Most games draw from both extremes. They have both fail states and an unreachable (practically) ceiling in their complexity. Chess is probably the best example.

4. In the context of a game, such a thing probably doesn't exist. In the context of a narrative however, absolutely. Even when I take it upon myself to tell my own narrative to myself as I play, like how I might when playing with toy figures. If I can name characters, I usually invent my own stories for them and reconcile them with the game narrative. Unless I have the option to name too many at once, in which case I use joke names and ignore them completely.

5. I don't think they are popular because of the part of them that are games. It is more like Hollywood experimenting with interactive stories using a well established Brand. But they are undoubtedly games, mainly an adventure game with QTEs and (somewhat) interactive narrative through dialogue options.

6. Any platform works. I hate making my phone a vector for attacks (besides the backdoors for the good 'ole 5-eyes), so if it is a mobile game I won't use unless it is open source AND elegantly written (and even then probably still won't bother). Any license is fine by me, but you might have qualms about releasing the source of a proprietary game you intend to sell. It is trivial by comparison to isolate any other platform, so no audit would be necessary on my end.

"dotamasterrace","t5_2z18c","I love how people in this thread are like. 'I spent $500 and don't regret a thing.'

I can see only a handful of reasons this. 

#1, They're incredibly rich. No real idea of the value of money.

#2, Their parents are rich. No real idea of the value of money.

#3, They might have mental health issues, due to how they lack any self control and spend money willy nilly. Same as Gambling or Addiction, could even fall under addiction, you'd be surprised what people can get addicted to.

#4, They're Stupid, Slow, Challenged? Either way you label it, they're doing things sane, semi-smart people don't do. To best describe this, imagine a League player in a office of someone who sells Timeshares... What exactly do you think is going to happen here? If you guessed 'Stupid decision', you're probably right. 

The fact that they try to justify it though is what really gets me. Riot is not a good company, I'm pretty sure we can all agree on this part. Numerous aspects show and prove that Riot is consistently sub-par.

I'm sure you enjoy the game, but guess what. There are other games out there that you would need to invest far less money in, and still have a great time in. The company doesn't need you spending as much as you do, most of them are infact completely fine with something like 5% of the community buying an item or two every other month. If League has 30 million players or something stupid like that, 5% of that is equal to 7.5 million still with just 5$ purchases every month. Spending in excess of 10$ a month is not helping the company as much as you think it would. You're actually a small minority compared to those that simply buy the occasional item. ","1417392472"

The sig 100w has a pretty decent voltage output for whats out there in its price range now, and its considerably lower for say the ipv3 or cloupor t8 to get the max wattage. So just keep that in mind and what your airflow can handle. Think of it all as a balance. god 180 has 12.v voltage output. so will kamry 200 and smy 260 and joy4life i believe. so upping the game slightly.

another issue that I probably shouldve put in the post is that before him I used to be a virgin, when we first tried to have sex it really hurt me a lot. to the point where we didn't have it again for a while. Now we can have sex again but I'm still a bit hurt at the beginning, but once he is in it stops hurting. However, I still do not orgasm. It's like I just want him to finish and enjoy it and to stop having sex. This is not his issue, this is mine. I never had orgasm before as I don't think i ever figured out how to do myself, I had vibrators, tried masturbation it didnt work, always thought that I'm putting too much pressure on it and that with a guy I love it would be different. However, right now I'm still dissapointed that this is it. Part of me wants to just try with another guy, not because I want to sleep with another guy, but I want to see if its my chemistry with him that isn't helping me or because I'm not fully attracted to him physically, or because its simply my issue that I have to deal with a doctor or something.

"business","t5_2qgzg","&gt; For every $10/barrel the price of oil drops, the GDP of US, UK, EU, Japan, and China all rise 0.2%. Oil dropping from $110 barrel down to $60/barrel puts hundreds of billions of dollars back into the pockets of consumers, and it may single handedly bring the EU out of recession and push the US GDP growth to over 4% for the first time in a decade.

Because this will kill our world. We had cars as efficient as those today in the 1970s after the oil shocks [1]. What's more there is the real and persistent danger of fear, uncertainty and doubt. Without major political sustained will to push renewables no one will invest in them if the Saudi can make them unprofitable every time tens of billions of dollars have been sunk into them and they become competitive with oil at a given price. 

Again, we had a renewables boom in the 1970s, which turned into an oil orgy in the 1980s because of politics. Had we sustained the political will them we would have been energy independent by the start of the 1990s with a near zero emissions economy.

The Saudi are a lot smarter than people give them credit for. This isn't any better for the advanced economies than a dealer giving free hits to his best client when it looks the client is about to quit heroin for good.

I think that the way it is now, with various difficulties, they could just add something to the easiest difficulty that allows you to get past things that are too hard.  Actually, it would be neat if they could have an option that said, ""Offer to skip battle if you die __ times"", and then you can fill in the blank if you want to have that option.

"ShouldIbuythisgame","t5_2ud8h","That's disappointing - at eight years old, never having touched an actual skateboard (still haven't to this day), and barely having the coordination to ride a bike, I absolutely adored just riding around the city in Extreme Skate Adventure, trying to pull off stunts from high places, and beating the high score challenges. I suppose there's probably only so many games that can do that before people get bored of it, though. With modern computers and consoles, I can just imagine a giant open-world skating game, though... I'm definitely going to have to pick up Skate 3 after emulating the older games.","1417392478"

However, I think TRP would largely disagree. The perspective would be to have many plates until one plate proves she is worthy of an LTR.

"ChristianOccultism","t5_33mib","Ok, time for my famous self-deprication in the guise of modesty: I am a novice among graduate students, so I don't have too much to contribute, I generally just lurk, but this seems sort of like an introductory thread so I'll put in my 2 cents.

I have bumped up against the fascistic form of electism so I generally do tend to shy away from that word. It seems like being among The Elect is more of a personal decision. Though I have chosen and am trying to follow The Way, saying I'm of the Elect does tend to make me feel a bit holier than thou.

I was raised Roman Catholic, went to Latin Mass as much as possible, wanted to be a priest, went to Catholic boys camp, the whole nine yards. As I grew up, I started gravitating more towards the Left (politically and socially speaking) as my Mom gravitated to the Right and is now a stereotypical Tea Partier. Realized I was gay at 14, accepted it at 17, went away to college, had a huge crisis of Faith, stopped going to church, bounced around Buddhism and Hinduism and such.

Now I'm moved back in with my parents, basically keep everything on the down low. Made a friend who went to a big Christian seminary and studied the Bible and Greek and such and we talked a lot about it. I realized that the Bible really ISN""T a big pile of BS, so I came back to Christianity but still can't find a church.

Then I 'met' bassackwards42 and my Journey really has taken off. He has really boosted my Faith and Hope, it's nice to meet someone who is in the same boat and is a super spiritual person who I can imagine drinking beer and smoking a cigar with. (""There are dozens of us! DOZENS!!!"") I'm learning some practical things and I feel more focused. Bassackwards came at the right time, though. He has helped a great deal, but he came right at the convergence of a bunch of things in my life.

ANYWAYS, to summarize an attempt at shortening a long story, I had the common experience of growing up in the Church, meeting some pretty shitty people, lost my Faith but knew that The Truth was still out there, decided to find The Truth on my own. Unlike bassackwards, my life has been EASY. Sure, I'm gay, I have a stutter, pretty dependent on my emotionally oppressive mother, probably have some kind of learning 'disability', etc but life has been good. Everything basically falls into my lap. All of my jobs have been through connections, family or friend, I somehow managed to avoid being bullied for most of my childhood, never been in a car crash, never broken a bone, etc. I'm lucky and blessed.

Bassackwards has said he has been trained his whole life to be God's Soldier, and it does seem to be pretty evident. The biggest battles I've fought have been with myself; insecurity, not accepting my homosexuality, etc. Perhaps I'm more of a Wizard, Healer, or Bard in the real life RPG lol

Oh geez, ok, what am I thankful for? Having a pretty nice life, God never having left me, having so many great things fall into my lap though I may not deserve them, r/ChristianOccult, the Internet, the Information Age, music......","1417392478"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","That is a wholly different issue altogether. No one should be forced or coerced into sexual activity they do not want. This includes you. Any partner's desire to relive traumatic experiences in the context of a loving, intimate relationship, does not overrule the other parter's need to give consent for partaking in that experience. 

He always can ask you to do something. You have every right to say no. He has the right to sit you down and explain why it is so important for him that his desire is fulfilled. You can still always say no, and should be able to count on having that wish respected. It is completely valid for you to explain to him that you're both incapable of and deeply unwilling to engage in any roleplay on the subject. But that does not make his fantasy inherently wrong or evil or predatory. 

If something goes wrong (or has gone wrong) in the process where he tried to engage you in his fantasy (say, he got pushy or coercive), then that is very shitty. I sincerely hope you've not felt forced into a sexual role play that you were uncomfortable with, If so, then that's a very serious matter, which needs attention by itself.

However, if your partner had had a fantasy involving balloons, or you wearing a penguin suit and sitting on a giant egg, your consent would have been equally important. No matter what the fantasy is, one partner still should not push or try to coerce the other. On the same note, the content of our fantasies and desires should not be open to judgment or shaming. Only the way in which we involve our partners with those fantasies is, because that's the only way our fantasies can hurt others. 

As to your question of why he may have expected (or asked - I hope he asked) you to be involved - I can only guess. As a very positive interpretation: maybe he felt incredibly safe with you and trusted you deeply, which is why he felt he could ask this of you. Maybe he felt that you understood him well enough and were kind enough to make this an experience of healing for him. He may be looking for a way to give comfort to his inner child. I can't imagine that anyone would ask this of another person flippantly, or with bad intent, but obviously I can be wrong in this. He may not have understood the impact your own experiences had on you, or he may have thought you possibly also felt this could be a healing experience.

I hope I'm not sounding too clinical. I think this is a very emotional issue for you and I'm trying very hard not to draw inferences based on your posts. I'm sorry for snapping at you earlier, but Im glad we're having a conversation now. ","1417392481"

A word of warning though - a lot of people buy a Shredmaster because of Jonny Greenwood and expect it to sound incredible because he uses one.

"eldertrees","t5_2tclf","It's a disgrace. I have a long history of mental health problems and have been told the same thing many times. I don't even smoke weed that often. I had a hallucination episode recently with severe auditory and visual hallucinations. I took this to be an outbreak of schizophrenia so I went to the hospital. They asked if I had done drugs that day. I said I smoked a bit (literally had one hit off a joint) earlier that day. They immediately stopped taking me seriously. I had a three hour wait time and had to deal with overhearing doctors and nurses talk about me as a ""dumb kid who did too many drugs"". After a three hour wait they put me in the ""mental health"" room which is a grey box with everything nailed down. They stationed security outside as if I was some kind of threat. The doctor interrogated me several times about other drugs, and was positive I was lying to him. He even laughed directly in my face when I said I thought I might have schizophrenia. Forgot to mention, my heart rate fluctuated at 150-170 for the first six hours I was there. The doctor accused me of doing meth. Obviously I was having severe physical symptoms as a result of being freaked out of my mind at just having had a terrifying hallucination. But all because I said I smoked weed earlier that day (hours before) they treated me with the worst patient decorum I've ever experienced. Ive smoked a lot of weed in my time. One hit off a joint is barely going to register let alone cause a severe and terrifying hallucination that made me run for my life for over a mile at full sprint. When I got home I locked the door and collapsed, my body wanting to cry but being too out of breath to do anything besides gasp for air like that one scene in Gattaca after the treadmill. It was an extremely traumatizing incident. I tried smoking weed a few times since. No hallucinations but severe anxiety at the thought of them happening again. It was the most real and terrifying thing I've ever seen. I don't want to go into details but this hallucination prayed on my own personal fear and made my worst Nightmare become a reality, I was chased for a long time. Sorry to put this long tirade on your comment, I haven't talked about it with anyone. ","1417392482"

Next, be aware that Propylene Glycol (PG) is really what carries the flavor. Vegetable Glycerin (VG) is more used for the thick billowing vape clouds, and doesn't carry flavor very well. If you're just starting off, I'd recommend looking into a bottle of PG (Flavor West, NudeNicotine, Wizard Labs are just a few places to check out for this), and start off with a 50/50 blend to really get a sense of what your bubble gum flavor tastes like.

* Also, each listen check takes some time! I'd say a minute at least. Depending on the dungeon you guys are at, this might be enough time for a random encounter check (or maybe the players are in a hurry).

* Finally, whatever you do, make the consequence clear for your players: ""You may try to hear again, but if there is anything on the other side of the door, it may hear you as well. Do you try?""

When my first child was born, my MIL went completely overboard like yours. I lay down some ground rules and she was respectful. She wanted the baby overnight. I said no thank you. She wanted to buy all of these crazy expensive toys that we didn't have room for. I said no thank you. You get the idea.

Fast forward to just after my second was born and I was completely overwhelmed. I finally decided, fuck it, I'm just going to let MIL jump in with both feet and get all the help I can with my kids. And at the exact time that I made that decision, she got really sick. Luckily, she's still around (for now), but very limited in how she can interact with the kids and can't go shopping for them and do all the things she always wanted to do. She never got to be the grandparent that she wanted to be and I feel like a complete asshole. I screwed her over, screwed myself over and screwed my kids over.

My advice: if it's not a safety/health issue, let your MIL be the grandmother she wants.","1417392490"

The flavor is ok, not like a plumeveil, but still pretty good. With the tons of airflow you have the potential for massive clouds. It has an adjustable pin.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Watch [this clip](http://youtu.be/TxAa2Hd7q8k) of Dan Savage advising on how to deal with homophobic parents and liken it to yourself. Rememer: access to your presence and communication is your leverage. Don't just give it away for free thinking you can just appeal to compassion or persuade them with reason. They weren't reasoned into it, so they won't be reasoned out of it. As soon as you have the footing to do so, you need to exercise that leverage.

Remember, even if you are screaming at their face, you are only affirming their beleif that they deserve for you to justify yourself to them. The contents of your words are completely lost in the action which might appear on the surface to be defiance but is really just submission and deference to what they percieve to be there right to demand explanations from you when they truly deserve none. Actions speak louder than words. When you have the footing, send a brief, simple, and dispassionate note explaining that until they learn to treat you as an equal member of society with the level of dignity and respect that they'd afford a never-Mormon neighbour or colleague , you will not communicate or interact at all. Then give them *nothing* but total radio-silence until they unconditionally agree to those terms. If they do, you begin to reward good behaviour and punish bad behaviour in a rigid, uncompromising fashion. Think of their behaviour like Pavlov's dog. Never visit them without your own transportation, and be prepared to leave *immediately* at at any breaking of the terms. This method *cannot* fail. Eventually they will either reform themselves or reveal themselves and things will be better to be a toxin which needs to be removed from your life. Hopefully it's the former. 

Consider sending your father [this article](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/august-web-only/religion-runs-in-family.html#bmb=1) on faith transmission at some point.

Also please read between the lines of [this article](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/july-web-only/is-family-decline-behind-religious-decline.html#bmb=1) on marriage and reverse engineer it for your situation.

First of all, what, if any is the connection with Corally?

Is Team C stuff ""original design"" or a reproduction of an older car from a bigger company? I say this, not as a bad thing either. A good example would be the Thunder Tiger BXII buggy. It's just a AE RC10B3. Yea, it's an ""older"" design, but I won a regional series in 1998 - with an RC10CE. Reproduction designs are a great way to just get out there. Usually there are a ton of parts out there as long as you know how to cross reference. 

Are Team C parts compatible with the ""industry standard""? I'm a big fan of racing mostly stock cars, but it's a real turn off when everything is proprietary and not interchangeable. I'm talking specifically about things like wheels and gears. I'd rather have a mediocre car that can take RRP Kimbrough gears and Proline wheels than something that needs some special design. 

It looks like it might be a good ""get on the track"" opportunity.

When I do vertical manoeuvres using keyboard and I roll the rolling doesn't stop when I stop pushing the button. It feels very unresponsive when I try to roll or stop rolling.

Aside from that I have yet to survive any hit in it as /u/G18AkimboPro said, DM is questionable.

I personally don't really like them, compared to a meteor F3 (not sea jebus) they are atrocious and I unlocked them at around the same time. With the meteor I just got out the free repair zone and I am nearly done with the performance upgrades, the R2Y2 don't have any performance upgrades (maybe the 1st) and is out of repairs.

I can, since I'm only discussing driving in Saudi to highlight the contrast of attitudes towards something that is internationally seen as the epitome of oppression and nationally seen as the epitome of inconvenience. If I were discussing treatment of women as a whole in the gulf, I'd discuss everything else.

Also I am not knowledgeable on the socio economic status of women in the gulf outside of Saudi, so I prefer not to comment. But it's a discussion worth having and I'd be happy to learn more if you'd like to comment elsewhere on the thread. 

&gt; I do believe you are both guilty of that

I don't think I am. I do not profess to speak for all women in the gulf unlike sdbolts, only a subsection, and even then, only a subsection of Saudi women.

"CalgaryFlames","t5_2roln","Depends, he has a good contract that expires at the end of this year. His production seems to be declining every year and the price of players in trades also seems to be coming down. He'd likely be a 3rd line player on a strong roster, maybe fit in on a 2nd line if a team was desperate. We'd be lucky to get a 2nd round pick but I think a 3rd is more likely to be honest. Couple years ago though, we could get a haul for him. Depends what the demand is, if there are teams out there who really need a winger we could fetch a 2nd. 

He'll likely want a bigger contract, somewhere around 3.5-4 next season I imagine. It'd be his last shot at a big contract considering he's 31. Unless he's going to get us a 2nd round pick, the best route would be trying to get another home town contract out of him. We need veterans who can score goals to mentor the young guys.

"tarot","t5_2qhu4","I did a relationship [mirror spread](http://www.angelpaths.com/spreads4.html) for you, focusing on clarifying what's going on with your relationship and what you need to know. Hope it's helpful:

1. The querent: 5 of Wands
You're feeling a lot of minor irritations and it seems like everything is going against you. You might feel in competition or at odds with others.

2. The way you see the other person: 3 of Cups
Seems like you value friendship and partnership, and that brings you joy. You might feel like you get that feeling from this person, or you might be wanting it.

3. The way they see themselves: 9 of Swords
This person may be making him/herself miserable. S/he sees themself as anguished, worried, guilty. 

4. What the person represents to you: The Lovers
You see a relationship built on deep love. You want a meaningful bond. This card -- and maybe this person -- asks you to think about whether you are being true to yourself and what really matters to you.

5. What you represent to them: Death
I'm reading this as a major change or transition. It's hard to say more without any context, but this card suggests that you represent an unknown to the other person. He or she might feel fated to be with you, like it's inevitable.

6. Obstacles within the relationship: The Sun
There's a lack of mutual understanding and it may be that someone is not being entirely truthful. It seems like neither of you have a lot of confidence in this relationship.

7. Strengths within the relationship: 5 of Cups
This card represents loss, sorrow, regret. If you are able to accept change, you will feel less sorrowful for what you perceive as a loss.

8. Probable result: Knight of Swords
You will find a greater sense of self-assurance and reason. You will become more direct about communicating your needs and wants, andd more logical about figuring out what those are. Trust yourself to make the right decisions. Be careful of being overbearing or rude.

The cards seem to caution that if you continue down this path, it will be a bumpy road. You are learning a lot about yourself from this relationship, but it's not the deep love you're seeking. ","1417392499"

I think the argument is more that ""you shouldn't try to get a good deal on your child's future.""

The way you're saying things comes across as very controlling. ""You do this or you do that. Here are your choices,"" as opposed to ""I'll help you out with this much money; that's what I can give you. Go wherever you want but if it's not enough to cover your degree then you will need to make up the difference.""

The last part of your post here--""one's as good as another""--betrays a condescending attitude that your children *will* pick up on. No, one art history degree isn't the same as another, and your belittling of both of them isn't helping anything.

"MillerPlanetside","t5_2wi6w","I am a moderator (of something else) myself, so here's my advice and opinions to the two in question.

**To Maelstrome**

You took the rules too literally. Yes they are there and there to be followed, but only as far as a guide for the people who use this subreddit. If somebody severely crosses the line, then by all means contact them. Deleting should be the absolute fucking last resort! 

Hell if you followed the rules so fucking closely, why did all the threads and comments about poor robinhugebreasts and SCEV stay up? The ones you've had your grubby mitts on seemed to only be ones with an opinion YOU disagreed on. You can't decide when and where the rules should exist. If you are as harsh with your deletes as you've been on the DIG/DIGT stuff, then you should have been harsh everywhere.

You fucked up. Slap on the wrists. The end.



**To Ruvan**

Oh but wait it isn't the end is it Ruvan? Because what did you go an do you silly old tart? You let a moderator issue slip out into public. Maelstrome posting it was obviously going to fucking happen if you don't handle your mods as though they're your partners. That's what they are Ruvan, your partners. They help you moderate the sub as much as you help them. They are not your ""go through the report list"" slaves. They are your partners. Together you're supposed to keep this subreddit alive and healthy. As a team. You should NEVER be above them. Ever. Had you of talked to Maelstrome as though he was on your level, which he should be, then this could have been handled nice and neat and out of the public eye.

You can't treat this sub like it's yours. It isn't. It's ours. The community is what keeps this place alive and everyone in it has a voice that contributes to it. Without us it would be barren and empty and without meaning. So you need to be super fucking wise about who, what, why things get moderated. This hasn't been true since I got here from Woodman and frankly it's been a shambles from the start. When the hell is allowing moderators to voice their opinions regarding specific outfits or people EVER a good idea?? It should be common sense to keep your noses out of drama, yet all the time I see mods contributing to it. It's retarded and obviously going to end in trouble as were seeing here.

If you feel the need to put arbitrary rules in place, then fine, but at least fucking make sensible ones! It's a game and this is a place where you can talk to and about your enemies. OBVIOUSLY there is going to be a little bit of shaming now and again. Changing them should almost never happen and if they do, then everyone and I mean EVERYONE needs to know about it.

Removing Maelstrome as a mod may have eventually been necessary if he repeatedly fucked up, but it DEFINITELY should have been kept amongst you. All we are left with now is a reddit community full of people not knowing who the fuck to trust. You fucked up, and on a gigantic fucking level.

Bring Stray back, for fucks sake. At least he understood what it meant to be a reddit mod and not a fucking dictator.


**TLDR; You're both utter dick holes and are making our community look like squabbling little kids, worse than any single other person on this subreddit ever has. Sort this shit out.**","1417392499"

All season long as soon as they hit the line, I've been guessing what the play is, an I, as a person who has never played football at a high level or defense at really any level, have been correct about 60% of the time. I can't imagine what linebackers who live and breathe the sport have been doing to it. Sometimes our players are talented enough to over come, but often they aren't. And Mazzone the younger has been an awful QB coach. Hundley has regressed. It's clear. And it's such a shame because he's such a nice, hardworking, respectable young man.

Black/white doesn't make too much of a difference although blacks are more at risk for HTN than whites and blacks are also more likely to have Autosomal Polycystic Kidney Disease (APKD), but anybody can get berry aneurysms. APKD used to be called Adult PKD because it affects adults, mostly, I THINK in their 40s and 50s, double check the age range though. The recessive form is more severe and presents in infancy or childhood, that screws up a bunch of things and is associated with the Potter sequence and some other nasty shit. GFR would be decreased and she'd have HTN because of the bilateral cysts in her kidneys, but that's not too important for the issue she's having right now. The key is, however ADPKD, as well as Ehlers-Danlos, and Marfan syndromes are all associated with Berry Aneurysms and Berry Aneurysms (because the connective tissue type things in the blood vessels are all fucked up), when they rupture, lead to subarachnoid hemorrhage. 

These patients usually describe the pain as the ""Worst headache of my life"", so much so that ""WHOML"" is a ubiquitous and understood abbreviation for it. If you talk to a patient who has it and say, ""Kind of feels like a THUNDERCLAP HEADACHE, doesn't it?"" They'll know exactly what you're talking about. Berry aneurysms can happen all over the place, but they are most common on the anterior communicating artery where it branches to the anterior cerebral artery. A lot of these never cause a problem and are only found incidentally. CT scan would show hyperdense opacities in the leptomeninges/sulci/and ventricals, think of diffuse infiltrates because they are ""subARACHNOID"" I think of ARACHNAPHOBIA and spiderwebs, the CT scans can look kinda like spiderwebs. I've been hearing different time estimates from people but if you do a Lumbar Puncture soon after the rupture you should find RBCs in the csf, so it will be slightly red on serial extractions (so you take 3 tubes or whatever and they all have the same amount of blood) vs a traumatic puncture, where the person CAUSED bleeding when they introduced the needle, which will have inconsistent/fluctuating blood findings on the serial extractions. If time goes by, First Aid 2014 says 2-3 days later (God bless them if they survive that long, ~50% are DOA and at least a third of people alive at admission still die later, can't remember the statistic for that however) they will have xanthochromic CSF, so it will be yellow because of the broken down RBCs and leaked biliverdin. You can also get yellow CSF with fungal meningitis, but symptoms will be very different. Opening pressure probably won't be an issue because it's not so much of a space occupying lesion. Unlike epidural and subdural which I'll explain next. 

Again, subarachnoids aren't really make space occupying clots and so CSF pressure change would be minimal, you would see that, as well as herniations, with subdural hematomas and [epidural hematomas, the latter of which looks like a football, because you get these with intense trauma like a baseball bat or helmet to the temple, rupturing the temporal bone/pterion and tearing the middle meningeal artery. They have rapid onset but their key feature is a lucid interval, so they pass out on the spot for a minute or two, then wake up feeling pretty okay. If they don't get help soon after they will go into a coma and die, this one freaks out a lot of health care workers because the patients come in completely calm and happy, maybe have some visual field defects from uncal herniation fucking up CN III and the occipital lobe blood supply from Posterior Cerebral Artery compression, but they're 100% with it, and then boom, lights out](https://www.med-ed.virginia.edu/courses/rad/headct/WEB%20JPEGS/EDH.jpg).

Subdural hematomas look like bananas on CT, because if you slip on a banana, unlike getting hit playing football, you'll only get a minor bump on your head, these are also space occupying and thus could change LP opening pressure, but more importantly, cause herniations. Acute/recent subdurals are that banana in a [hyperdense color](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Subduralandherniation.PNG/230px-Subduralandherniation.PNG), because that's how blood looks on CT, chronic/older subdurals are kind of hard to see and are hypOdense because the blood breaks down and the particles cause a tonic gradient which sucks in water, making the clot [more dilute and less dense](http://caribbean.scielo.org/img/revistas/wimj/v56n6/a15fig01.gif). These rupture the bridging/emissary VEINS draining blood from the head. Because they are veins, they are low pressure and don't bleed very quickly. The result is that while subarachnoid start hurting out of the blue at extreme, quick, intensity, and epidurals have the immediate effect of syncope, these guys accumulate blood very slowly and patients may not have symptoms until days or even WEEKS later. The result is that they often don't even remember the little bump that caused it. The elderly and alcoholics are most predisposed to this because they have brain atrophy, which puts tension on on the emissary veins and makes them more likely to tear with a mild bump; people who suffer from whiplash in, like, a motor vehicle accident, might also get these because of the sheer force on the ","1417392502"

&gt;Last month Mr Putin made her wait for hours for a scheduled meeting in Milan. Unfazed, she spent the time instead having a leisurely stroll through the city.

His arrogance is off the charts. No matter how powerful someone is (or thinks they are), Merkel's time is very valuable. For fun lets assume Obama, Cameron or Hollande is more powerful than Putin. I cant imagine any of them intentionally doing any of those things Merkel. So damn arrogant. ","1417392502"

The beer is very cheap and the chocolate is very, very expensive. The people are nice if you make an effort to speak French (or Dutch I'd imagine, although I can't speak it).

No, it's completely bullshit. It wasn't until the advent of the modern helmet in the late 1960s and early 1970s that the death rate and spinal injury rate in football saw a sharp and permanent decrease. Take helmets away and we'll be looking at skull and spinal fractures at alarming rates and players dying on the field much much more. We have evidence of what football was like before helmets and padding, players didn't hit nicer, they killed each other. 

&gt;We don't hear about concussions in rugby like we do in football.

For the same reason we didn't hear much about concussions in football in the 1990s and earlier. It's not because they don't exist, it's because they haven't been treated seriously and properly recorded. Rugby culture up until *very* recently saw concussions like we saw them 20 years ago, they were seen as nagging injuries that were to be shrugged off, not anything that required proactive diagnoses and benchings. As stricter protocols are being implemented they're finding they've been massively undereporting concussion numbers and they've [already been finding evidence of CTEs in former players](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/rugby-union/27655550). I mean, are we really going to ignore stories like [this](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=11264856) and [this](http://www.bbc.com/sport/0/rugby-union/23495774).

"funny","t5_2qh33","I think your way of looking at things is reasonable, but the issue is the slippery slope. If everyone was reasonable then applying a law like this has zero issues. The problem is when someone comes into power and uses the law as a bludgeon or silencing tool. I think in America it is in our blood to be fearful of that, and I'm sure Lithuania has similar reasons.

My point is simply that, you can make the distinction between insults and criticism and it makes sense to you and me. But what if you go on TV and say ""The President is a jerk."" What if it is part of your satirical play to begin with ""The Prime Minister is an asshole."" There may not be a criticism in the words themselves but it could be part of a larger criticism. Asking a court to unpack all this is very messy.

Ultimately what your constitution says is how I feel, but I don't think the law lines up completely with your constitution. Your constitution champions the freedom to express convictions. And that includes my conviction that someone is a retarded cunt face bitch. Yes, it's not something that you want to hear, it's not something that adds to the discussion, but I still should have a right to say it. Voltaire and all that.

To me, what you're talking about, you say it should be a short imprisonment or fine. So we agree that if you say something like this, it is a minor infraction at best. In that case, what is even the point? What is the major benefit of having this law, it is only stopping something that we all agree is minor - someone getting momentary hurt feelings (and, without the law, they could respond with their own insult). Without the law, you never run the risk that it is misapplied, or used to silence legitimate speech. The truly damaging insults can be handled in civil court. 

None of that addresses the law that was originally posted, which was up to a YEAR in prison. The idea that you could say something, and get a full year in prison for expressing yourself, insult or not, is utterly noxious to me - even if they rarely apply it that way, the mere fact that someone thinks an appropriate response for someone calling someone a name is a full year taken off of their life as a free person is insane to me.","1417392505"

Some Manson scholars think the whole Helter Skelter thing was nonsense, and point out that Tex worked at the home that became Sharon Tates and was the only one with any knowledge of the place, and it was probably revenge gone wrong and Manson was a fringe figure.

Yet all I've read are the same type of statements in which they try to shift blame to both the community, Dreamhack and other teams. They are trying to play the victim and make everyone else look like the bully, I'm having none of it. While it's true that the reactions towards Flusha his (very suspicious) clips was a bit over the top, people have the right to question if he's legit and if they kept playing legit those accusations would have eventually died down. They actually cemented these negative feelings by their mind-blowingly stupid move against LDLC. I'm not buying the whole ""we didn't realize it wouldn't be allowed"" or the ""it's really not that great of an exploit"" sentiments. They purposly kept it secret for over two months and then pulled it out on a major, ruining the entire map for over 300k people. They knew very well how strong it is, it breaks the entire map if used on an unsuspecting opponent. What's more, I'm confident that they pulled it out as a last resort. They were bound to lose that map, the momentum was swinging LDLC their way and they were on point. Even with that boost, it got really close some rounds and LDLC seemed very rattled. So they figured : ""We do this and risk the fallout, or we lose"".

I would argue the more specific you are the easier it is to differentiate exactly how a game compares to another game. And not only this, but by making it so limited, it's now almost impossible to use 1 or 5, because was anything *really* as bad a ""Big Rigs Over the Road Racing"", or as good as a game like Mass Effect 2 or Half Life 2?

Each molecule of the hydrocarbon compounds in these fuels (neither gasoline nor diesel are just one kind of chemical, each is a mixture of several similar chemicals) has multiple Carbon-Hydrogen bonds.  Burning (oxidizing) each molecule releases energy every time you replace a C-H bond (or even a C-C bond) by attaching an atom of Oxygen to the Carbon or Hydrogen atom instead.  Plus, the fuels are liquid at room temperature and ordinary atmospheric pressure and relatively easy and safe to store.  Compare this to a molecule of Hydrogen: just two bonds per molecule to be replaced with Oxygen bonds.  And the Hydrogen must be stored as a pressurized gas.","1417392507"

1. You are severely limiting your viable space. Instead of say, 250-300 people that may play regularly on a server competing for space and resources, you get that number multiplied by the number of servers in the hive. As an added problem, players have no indication of where activity lies and cannot even defend their tents, since someone could find one, jump into a low pop server and loot it at his leisure.

2. It would be very difficult to keep it synchronized from a technical perspective. Consider two players placing a tent in the same spot in different servers simultaneously, or a player placing a tent as in another server a vehicle or players goes through the location of the tent. This is a real-time scenario and you cannot exactly put a lock on the database to restrict certain spaces, since you will basically restricting movement in all the hive for that location for a small amount of time.","1417392508"

The Logitech gaming software and this headset seem to have issues communicating with each other on Windows 8.1, making it useless unless you uninstall the drivers and just use the generic Windows USB audio driver - losing Dolby and G keys in the process. *Occasionally* the G software will work but it'll take 30 seconds or so for the headset to connect properly *if* it decides you're worthy enough.

On the other hand, this headset sounds fantastic as does the microphone. It has some cool touches like the microphone will mute itself if you place it in the up position. The range is okay but nothing to sing praises about. Battery life is also pretty good but has room for improvement. 

Despite its issues though, it's probably one of the better wireless headsets out there - or at least it was a few years ago when I purchased it.","1417392509"

I don't think she is being selfish, and I'm not sure why your husband is so angry with her. To me, this sounds like an admirable effort, considering that she felt awful on the inside. She didn't have much time to process your news before being expected to put on a smile and spend a long day with you -- but she still went and tried to say the right things.  I think it's unfair to be upset with her for wanting to cut the day short, when you knew how she was feeling.

My advice is to stop trying so hard -- you're coming on really strong with all of your gushing about how she's your best friend in the world, she's going to be an awesome auntie, and you can't wait to see her again.

Rachel most likely needs space to process her feelings. You know that she's not feeling cheerful right now, so stop trying to force it. Give her some time to get used to the situation.","1417392509"

The OP in that thread is acting like a dick. No question about it: He and his wife are blaming the girlfriend while completely ignoring that it takes two to tango. Their son is equally at fault for the unplanned pregnancy and he must deal with the consequences.

But in what world is this man obligated to financially and emotionally support this girl?

Most people would be furious that their unwed teenage child is planning on having twins. They recognize that it is a huge emotional and financial burden to take care of children, and severely hinders their future educational and job prospects. 

This man is under no obligation to take this ~~stranger's~~ child into his home and support her, regardless of the fact that his son knocked her up. I know that everyone on reddit loves to throw stones, but can any of you say with certainty that you would be fully willing to allow this child to move into your home?

This family has raised FIVE children, and now they are being thrust into the position of having to support another three people. No matter how you slice it, that is an enormous burden, and I don't blame them for being upset and wanting to lash out and try to point fingers. They are being put into an extremely difficult situation.

"DIY","t5_2qh7d","Considering the variance in the cut area, baseboards would be out of the question.  So, I'd go with your idea to use 1x6 boards with routed edges.

As for the floor, I've never done the brown bag method, and my only hesitation would be the difficulty of removing it (should you decide to do something different in the future).  I have no idea if it would be hard to take it up, so that's something you should consider.

The cheapest way to cover the floor is probably rolled laminate/vinyl.  There are tons of options (designs), and you can find it fairly cheap.  It's easy to install, and depending on which method you use to lay it, it's easy to replace.  Nowadays, the laminate/vinyl flooring materials are strong and stand up to a fair amount of wear and tear.

I tried to think about ways to argue that it's wrong, but outside of the balance of power/psychological development argument it's really difficult.

Ultimately I think you just have to explain to her that although sex is not a dirty thing both parties have to consent, and if a person doesn't feel that way about you, then you must accept that and not pressure them into doing something they are uncomfortable with.  It does not mean that you don't love her, it's that it's a boundary for you and she needs to respect yours and other people's boundaries.  (basically friend-zone your daughter)

That kind of settles the issue, but it doesn't settle the issue of incest between siblings, cousins, etc.  Another argument is required there, and I don't know how to handle that one.

"factorio","t5_2wabp","I rather like this idea, having a system automatically add bots until the network is satisfied is a great way to conserve resources. These control components arn't all that expensive. 

As someone who is very conservative with logistics robots, I might have use for a design like this. I'll bet you can optimize the design by using the robots themselves for the logic, or just using the green/red smart system for the control. I'll have a fiddle with it. 

Again, cool idea.

*edit* an idea: You could potentially remove the need to calibrate based on bot speed by making the request and destination chest be as close together as possible. What matters is if a robot is in the system that can respond to the request, not the distance they can move an item. ","1417392518"

i have also beat hard raid legit (mythoclast first hm (pre-nerf) and helmet second hm) but this took so much wipes

i now do raid 3x a week on hard, i also have 3 30s (each class). i do not need to waste time on templar with no rewards. i also dont need ascendant materials (200+ of each) but this is the fastest way to beat raid in less than an hour. atheon bugs make it longer than necessary.

i also used to cheese atheon to death for friends. it jus saves so much time. specially when ur friends need gear but rng hates them. i have a friend who tried to cheese oracles and templar for a month jus to get boots or gloves but had to resort to IB boots and gloves to finally reach 30. overall it jus isn't worth the hassle if you aren't gettin anythin u need.","1417392518"

"tf2","t5_2qka0","The problem we have with the economy is that metal is going down. Keys are not really going up, metal is just becoming less and less valued that we need more of it to make a key. The reason metal is going down? Item drops. People are finding items such as weapons or hats and crafting them into metal. This is making metal more common. The last thing we need are more free item drops being crafted into metal.

The solution would be to make something that can only be bought from the Mann Co. Store (but still sold on), like keys, or Tour of Duty tickets, craftable. I would propose that tour of duty tickets be made craftable from 5 ref. This would mean that from then on, refined metal would be worth 1/5 of a Tour of Duty ticket. This would also give keys a static price of 12 fifths of a Tour of Duty ticket. This basically means that everything gets a static price that is not subject to any change.","1417392519"

Artificial amateurs, aren't at all amazing
Analytically, I assault, animate things
Broken barriers bounded by the bomb beat
Buildings are broken, basically I'm bombarding
Casually create catastrophes, casualties
Cancelling cats got their canopies collapsing
Detonate a dime of dank daily doing dough
Demonstrations, Don Dada on the down low
Eating other editors with each and every energetic
Epileptic episode, elevated etiquette
Furious fat fabulous fantastic
Flurries of funk felt feeding the fanatics
Gift got great global goods gone glorious
Getting godly in his game with the goriest
Hit em high, hella height, historical
Hey holocaust hints hear 'em holler at your homeboy
Imitators idolize, I intimidate
In a instant, I'll rise in a irate state
Juiced on my jams like jheri curls jocking joints
Justly, it's just me, writing my journals
Kindly I'm kindling all kinds of ink on
Karate kick type brits in my kingdom
Let me live a long life, lyrically lessons is
Learned lame louses just lose to my livery
My mind makes marvelous moves, masses
Marvel and move, many mock what I've mastered
Niggas nap knowing I'm nice naturally
Knack, never lack, make noise nationally
Operation, opposition, off, not optional
Out of sight, out of mind, wide beaming opticals
Perfected poem, powerful punchlines
Pummelling petty powder puffs in my prime
Quite quaint quotes keep quiet it's Quantum
Quarrelers ain't got a quarter of what we got uh
Really raw raps, rising up rapidly
Riding the rushing radioactivity
Super scientifical sound search sought
Silencing super fire saps that are soft
Tales ten times talented, too tough
Take that, challengers, get a tune up
Universal, unique untouched
Unadulterated, the raw uncut
Verb vice lord victorious valid
Violate vibes that are vain make em vanished
While I'm all well would a wise wordsmith just
Weaving up words weeded up, I'm a workshift
Xerox, my X-ray-diation holes extra large
X-height letters, and xylophone tones

"technology","t5_2qh16","That's an incredibly stupid way to think about it. Programming is good for the brain and develops the logical thinking of a person. I mean, by your argument we shouldn't teach complex mathematics in school either, since they aren't needed in normal life. But the point of teaching mathematics is to improve the logical thinking and deduction of a child. For example, I have never needed to use derivative after learning it, but I still think that learning it advanced my thinking.

Also, if you knew about computers you'd know that it's extremely unlikely, if not impossible, that there will be a new way of computing that has nothing to do with modern programming.

And the fact is that jobs are being automated at a exponential rate. And who are automating them? Programmers, and the engineers who make the machines for the programmers to program. This is why programming can be a very important thing to learn, and the importance of it is only growing.

&gt;Who needs farmers when you have programmers!

It's hard for me to grasp the point of this sentence. Are you saying it's a bad thing that programmers and engineers automating farming so that less farmers is required is a bad thing? Or are you saying that farming is a more important thing to learn than programming?","1417392520"

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

"poker","t5_2qhix","Well, remember the preflop action. 87s isn't likely to 4x 3-bet you OOP; what's he going to do if you 4-bet? (which you probably should have). He's put an awful lot of money out there, and if he was bluffing he could bluff less and have the same effect.  So, I think it's for value - guy's got a pocket pair - a good pocket pair - or two high cards. I doubt very much that he'd have JdTd or Jd9d.  

Then on the flop, he check-called your half-pot bet (when he was the first aggressor). There are a couple reasons he'd do that. 

1) He has a marginal hand with showdown value and wants to keep the pot small to get value by bluffcatching.  (JJ, TT, 99, AQ)

2) He's got what *he* percieves to be a monster and wants to trap you. (Kx, AA) 

3) He's on some sort of draw.  **Because we probably think he's playing high cards or pocket pairs**, and all of the three highest cards in diamonds are dead, **it's unlikely he's got a flush draw.**  So that leaves straight draws, and that's just AJ and JT who might peel one. 

The TURN: 

4) When the 3 of diamonds hits the turn, it's unlikely that he has the flush. In fact, it's *MORE* likely that *YOU* have the flush, given the preflop action and the small bet on the flop, which could be seen as a blocking bet. The problem with betting full pot is that you're essentially turning your strong (but non-nut) hand into a bluff (representing a better hand than you have) which folds out a lot of hands that would call a smaller bet and only gets those hands that are better than yours (made flushes and boats) to call or raise. 

Honestly, I simply can't see a river card that is *bad* for your hand.  A fourth diamond improves you to a flush, an ace or a paired card gives you a boat, anything else and you still have trips-top-kicker.  A fourth diamond might kill action, sure, but so does betting big on the turn.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Kid Icarus Uprising is easily my favorite game for the 3DS I love pretty much everything about it. 

The only thing that is a bit off is the pretty formulaic plot but this problem is completely nullified by the excellent writing and voice acting. For those that haven't played the game, the comedy is a bit cheesy, it breaks the 4th wall a lot, the game isn't afraid to make fun of itself and it makes fun of Pit quite a lot as well. The characters have conversations while you are playing the game which sounds like it could be intrusive or distracting but it isn't, at least not to me. 

I don't know what people are on if they are saying the writing and voice acting is bad, it might not be your sort of comedy but it is done really well. I'd go as far to say the conversations the characters were having during the game were the best part of it. 

As for the controls, I understand how some people might have problems with them but I also think a lot of people exaggerated how uncomfortable it was. It might take a little while but most people will get used to it easily. 

While I do prefer the Air segments, I still enjoyed the ground parts immensely. The bosses were awesome but simple, none of them had a lot of attack patterns but they were fun. 

The Weapon system was great fun as well although it was a little random. I liked that they let you see the result of fusing 2 weapons before you actually fuse them. It's something that should be expected but we are talking about Sakurai here, he likes randomness. 

Most importantly, the game is just fun to play, I would really recommend it to everyone. I think everyone with a 3DS should at least try it since I don't think there is another game like it on the system. ","1417392532"

But, this also seems to be a general trend that when people become more mature, they become more religious/spiritual.  I know, it might just be because of the home I was raised in. And, maybe, a large part of it is the fact that a major part of religion is accepting a higher power and that you are not the center of the universe. Which is probably seen as very mature thing to realize. (Which I think is funny, since a lot of atheists I know say that exact same thing about Christians.)

Making statements on things you are ignorant of certainly isn't the worst thing one can do by any means but is still bad as it further distorts discussion. You seem to be under the impression that Egypt is setting some sort of amazing precedent by denouncing ISIS when they've been pretty opposed to Islamists since the coup government took power. They recently created a buffer zone to further isolate gaza and long before this launched a war against islamists as well as anyone seen to be an islamist. Egypt really isn't admired by muslims across the world and they will not care at all about its stance on ISIS, as they already oppose ISIS and don't like the coup government.

&gt;And while majority of Muslims might have been opposed to ISIS-like organizations, they certainly were much less loud about it, defaulting to a cultural solidarity more often than not.

The general reactions of Muslims to ISIS seems to be getting more attention but is hardly different than it has been for over the last decade in regards to extremist organizations. Muslims governments and scholars nearly unanimously rejected terrorism and there was a civil war in Iraq as well, which saw groups like al-Qaeda doing things like beheading young girls, using children as suicide bombers etc. To say that terrorist groups were ""smoldering"" during this period is to be ignorant of the last decade. Same goes for implying there were no ""loud"" reactions. The majority of the victims of these terrorist groups are muslim and they've been hated for awhile, and not secretly accepted. Muslims don't owe anyone apologies for things they themselves detest, and neither do they need to have million man marches 24/7 just to convince westerners that they condemn terrorists who want them dead.

"LordsoftheFallen","t5_2xjqz","As a souls veteran I was expecting this game to come pretty easy but I was wrong. I think a lot of it isn't actual difficulty but rather this games tendency to leave you with very few opportunities to attack bosses as the game progresses. Some bosses towards the end took as long as 15-20 minutes with a lot of walking around blocking and dodging waiting to get a hit in. That's not difficult it's just tedious. 

Also some enemies were nearly impossible to hit without abusing the shield bash ability to stun them every time. These giant monsters recover from their huge swinging attacks too fast!

This game did a great job with some stuff and got a lot of stuff wrong. It falls short of the Souls series I a lot of ways but the ""this isn't Dark Souls"" argument doesn't sit with me since I first became aware of this game after watching a demo where the developers themselves talked about how similar it was to Dark Souls. 

Also, way too much backtracking, I really coulda used a teleport option by the end.","1417392533"

There are high end escorts that specialize in making people feel cared about and could probably teach someone a thing or two. Who knows if it would actually help an older virgin get over that hump of unfamiliarity and make them more comfortable in an intimate setting. Without ever being in that position, we wouldn't know. It would be interesting to start a thread asking the people who have actually followed this advice and see what effect it had on their sex life. 

I'm fairly inexperienced in the grand scheme. I've only been with two people. The first person I had ever been with I actually just left this year, and it was not a very sexually comfortable environment because he was controlling and his ego got in the way. I didn't realize what sex was actually supposed to be like until I slept with the man I had been in love with for a long ass time. At that point the sex was amazing because neither one of us thought about it and it was entirely driven by passion and 7 years of sexual tension/desire. He said I was fucking awesome. I'd like to think he was serious. 

Despite having so few partners, I really don't think anyone would ever think I was a virgin. However, they probably could tell that I am a little inexperienced. ","1417392534"

The talent that was expected to come through in the last two to three years hasn't really developed in the way they'd like, which is starting to hurt. 

- Christensen is gone (and will be a much bigger loss than most would expect)
- Billie Smedts hasn't been able to make a consistent contribution 
- anything Daniel Menzel does from here on in is a bonus
- Taylor Hunt couldn't hold down a spot
- Mitch Brown never really made an impact (they probably had him earmarked as a foil for Hawkins, but it never happened)
- Jordan Murdoch, Cam Guthrie and George Horlin-Smith are good honest players but not necessarily game-breakers. 

They've brought in Josh Caddy, who's a star, but the list depth that Hawthorn, Sydney and to a lesser extent Port and Fremantle have isn't there - which becomes an issue the longer the season rolls on. 

Clark/Stanley/Walker/Kersten need to take the heat off Hawkins - if your top goalkickers after your key forward are Bartel, Johnson and Selwood the gameplan's not working. Losing Chapman and Podsiadly for not much in return looks like a bad decision right now; they were much closer to a flag with them than without.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","My favorite is a fighting game called BlazBlue Chronophantasma for these reasons:

* A big part of the game is based on changing the combo route to fit the current situation, such as the move at which you start the combo, counter hit or no counter hit, does he have the necessary meter to use any supers in the combo etc., and I find it really fun to see what good players come up with
* You can use 'bursts' to get out of any combo, but the combo-ing player can choose to end the combo early and to block the burst, which is called burst-baiting. It is very difficult to predict when the other player bursts, but they are very effective since during the next few frames the bursting player is open to attacks and cannot burst out of the combo. So seeing someone do a succesful burst-bait is very rewarding ([example](http://youtu.be/MsO_eMiSQAE?t=4m7s))","1417392537"

That goes for every character, but especially Link since he can't really poke around safely until the opponent makes a mistake.

One of my early games, back in the original game (sans expansions) I was playing TEC, and didn't manage to get more than a dozen planets before the hordes of max-level AI started flooding into my system.

Now, AI was advent, I'm TEC, so I've got a massive defensive advantage. My shieldworld took the brunt of an assault for hours if not *days* of ingame time while I slowly reasearched and expanded against the pirates the AI was bribing to murder me.

I won that game. Barely. First victory ever. Took almost a week of in-game time. Totally worth it.","1417392537"

"Denmark","t5_2qjto","Der er jeg så også uenig.

Xenofobi bunder (i min verden) i noget irrationelt. En overdrevet og ubegrundet frygt for fremmede kulturer. Et samfund som Danmark der har taget så mange flygtninge ind og åbnet grænserne til udlandet, kan ikke klandres for at være xenofobisk. 

Det tyder så på at mange af os har fortrudt at vi har taget SÅ mange ind, og også fortrudt at vi afskaffede grænserne, men det bunder ikke i noget irrationelt, men i at vi har mærket konsekvenserne af det. Og at vi gerne vil have Danmark til at blive et trygt lille smørhul igen, uden terrorfrygt, bandekrige, øst-kriminelle, hjemmerøverier og ældre der dør på vore plejehjem fordi der ikke er råd til ordentlig pleje af dem. 

Det er ikke irrationelt, det ville være irrationelt hvis vi IKKE følte trang til at isolere os lidt mere fra omverdenen i den givne situation. Jeg havde heller aldrig troet at Israel/Palæstina konflikten ville komme til Danmark, men det er ikke desto mindre hvad der er sket. Og det bliver værre. Hvis det at jeg er bekymret over den udvikling gør mig til xenofob, så har jeg det fint med det. Hellere xenofob i et godt og trygt samfund end tossegod, der er så angst for at blive beskyldt for at være racist at muligheden for at skrue på den knap der hedder ""lad os være LIDT mere isolationistiske"" slet ikke eksisterer. 

Vi skal kunne begge dele, vi skal kunne åbne op for flygtninge og fremmede, men vi skal også kunne lukke af når det bliver for meget. Vi skal behandle de flygtninge der kommer til vores land ordentligt. Det kan vi ikke når vi tager for mange ind fordi vi er bange for at tage diskussionen om der kan være FOR mange.","1417392540"

also after the show my sister somehow got back stage and smoked a blunt with her, i think because she bought and decorated a shirt for lil debbie, and then lil debbie made her leave by spraying her in the face with a water gun. which would normally be hilarious but my sister never smokes so she was high outta her mind off some cali green and had this hoe spraying her with water instead of just asking her to go.

We're so consumed with how girls are raised, thinking carefully about colors, barbies, if they're treated fairly, if they're too sheltered, if they're too weak, if they're too exposed to realities, etc. etc. It's over-engineering, and with all this effort we develop little princesses who can do no wrong. To them, society revolves around them as we constantly talk about girls with lower pay, not doing well in science, how we can change it. We basically judge our society based on how we treat females. It's just a lot of pressure, and it creates this situation. My girlfriend grew up without a father, and is the sanest girl I've ever dated. Every other female I dated probably ended up worse off by having been raised by a father. The father was either too repressive or too lenient.

No metal detectors, no searches, no taking off of any belts or shoes, no restrictions on liquids.  Nobody's luggage goes through a scanner, nobody gets ""randomly selected"" to get patted down.  And as an added bonus, you never get charged for luggage either, and there's no limit to how many you can carry on.  Also there are power outlets at every seat and a lot of trains have free wifi.

I understand that is the Catholic position. The point I was trying to make is that God wouldn't contradict himself.

I'm not really sure what point you're referring to. The argument only works if we're Christ's physical body, because Mary gave birth to a physical body. But we are not Christ's fleshly body, since John said we are not born of God from the flesh, but from God Himself. So the argument that Mary is our mother because we are Christ's body seems to fail significantly.","1417392544"

Because of the figureheads championing the cause being largely right-wing. Because the targets are largely female, or people who are generally socially progressive, or who offer criticism related to societal issues in terms of gaming. 

Also, feminism isn't a gender. And even so, females are still considered an underrepresented demographic when it comes to gaming, while they get a disproportionate amount of abuse hurled their way, generally speaking. Hence why their cause is  championed, and why gender is brought into it. Just because males get harassed as well, that doesn't mean that people shouldn't fight against female harassment specifically. And that's ignoring, again, that generally speaking, women have it worse in the tech world than men do. If you need convincing of that, I'm not sure what to tell you.","1417392547"

Having first hand experience living in areas where Gypsy travelers visit often i can say that alot of this segregation is due to the shortness and infrequency of the gypsies appearances. im my local area we have a village green where they sometimes stay in caravans for about a week at a time. They dont talk/ socialise with any locals and generally dont clear up the area where they have been just leaving trash and waste every where. which tax money is spent on clearing up. I personally dont want to say its their fault that the British public has such a low opinion of them, but iv never seen a gypsy do anything positive to give people a high opinion of them. 
i think that more should be done on a political level to improve relations but that would require money to be spent on an issue that would benefit people who dont pay money into the tax system. Maybe im ignorant and racist. i hope im not.

Having more weight over the wheels that turn though is known to aid in winter driving but if centered then yeah, likely it's all good RWD or not. Plus for sporty and quick handling on clean roads RWD is preferred so they've got the perfect balance I guess.","1417392547"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; the 1337 byte image you mention doesn't include remote invocation and according to the announcement on the website was created more or less by hand by carefully modifying the VM simulator and jury rigging the created image to begin execution in a specific execution context.

Ah, reading the link, you are correct. 

&gt; This was done in 2006, and it isn't a good illustration of Spoon in general. The images that Craig has released of Spoon are nowhere near this ""smallest image"", and in my experience are very unstable.

Getting better, I think


&gt; http://netjam.org/spoon/smallest/

&gt; Moreover remote invocation is really a VM issue, and as a matter of comparison the 12 byte image I mentioned above is technically capable of talking over the network. Obviously the code to make use of this capability would take a bit more than 12 bytes but we're talking on the order of a few 10s of bytes here [1].

&gt; You just need to pack any arguments to the networking instructions/primitives and then encode the instructions in the image. Smalltalk suffers here because it insists that everything be hung off of some snazzy object model but if you just encoded the primitives you could quite easily do better... but then it's really not Smalltalk any more.

How would your solution work with a massively multi-core distributed system?

&gt; Assuming that the 1337 bytes were in fact related to remote messaging (which they aren't) this would still be rather bloated; it's still more than 1 kb over the baseline.

Depends on what you want to DO with the system, I guess.","1417392547"

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt;My question regarding this one is, is it true that GG is anti-SJW and feminists (not women)? If so, why? 

SJW are racist, i hate rascim, so i'm against them easy as that. GG is not against feminists like Sommers and so on, we are against SJW not feminists. 

SJWs censor us, they compare us to ISIS, they want to ""kill"" us in concentration camps, they want to ruin the lifes of game-dev males and females alike. SJW are fucking poison in any instance and we have to be the antidote.

&gt;How does GG separate itself from the blatant misogynists and sociopaths that most people hear about?

We have the GG harassment patrol, this is enough, there is no real proof of harassment from a GGer anyway, the bigger sites just made this up.

&gt;no major news outlets (gaming centered or not) are really reporting on the breach of ethics going on in the industry.

They will never write about that, sry but this is not how MSM works. Look at other topics, capitalism, ressources, politics. No big media outlet writes about the real problems! 

How many people died of ebola? ~1200. But **every day** 50000 humans starve to death, while we in germany throw away 40% of our food, but you read nowhere about that. The MSM is owned buy rich guys and they only report stuff, which is good for them. The MSM don't care about the truth, they care about what their boss wants.

The G7 states need 40% of all resources worldwide to function (less than 1.5 billion humans). China and India are as big or bigger as all G7-states combined (population wise) and if they get money they want the good stuff too. Nice, now we only need 120% of the worldwide resources without afrika, south america and many EU-countries. How should that work? Why does nobody write about that Oo?","1417392550"

For myself, I was hired on as a interactive designer but now do mostly print work.  But I have also dabbled in css/html and some other misc. stuff depending on where the needs were.

For my internship, It was the same thing really.  Did mostly web design stuff, but also some print and poster design... but then assisted with some c4d and after effects and then tied that all together with premiere.   I ended up getting pretty proficient with after affects in a short time.

"altnewz","t5_2y9zm","You don't need to just believe them.  The Brown family commissioned their own autopsy which had the same results as the local autopsy, the federal autopsy, and the independent autopsy.  All of which showed that Brown was not shot at all in the back and he was not shot with his hands up.  Mike Brown's blood inside the officers vehicle and on his gun (along with his fingerprints on the officer's gun) shows that Brown was, in fact, reaching into the vehicle and grabbing the officer's gun.  (Also realize that the scene of the shooting was surrounded by dozens of people from the neighborhood immediately after it occurred so it isn't like the police could have staged the scene to favor the officer without dozens of people seeing it).  You can ignore his story and just look at the science and you will see what the story is.  Ignore your personal biases and ignore the initial media narrative (it seems most outlets are now coming to grips with reality and acknowledging that ALL of the physical evidence supports Wilson's story) and just read the evidence.  It would literally be impossible for any grand jury to look at the evidence and decide to indict the officer unless they were intentionally ignoring the evidence.  ","1417392552"

"drumcorps","t5_2rwjm","Ah! I've been waiting for the perfect opportunity to tell this story! 

I was 18 years old when I tried out for SCV. Back then everyone who auditioned in the hornline was given a numerical ranking. This year the corps was accepting 22 trumpets, and I was ranked 33. I had such a great time however that I decided to stick it out. 

Flash forward to move-ins and I was now ranked 23. A handful of people dropped in the months leading up to this date for various reasons. I decided to keep at it again and moved in with he corps for all-days. 

There was one veteran member during this time that was in London for his University's Wind Ensemble tour. By the time he returned he had missed 11 out of 14 days of 12hr rehearsals. I had been marching in his spot and had built up trust amongst the other members that I could do it. This, combined with the fact that this guy wasn't the most well-liked member in the corps resulted in the veteran members standing up for me. 

He quit and I was in, and the first performance was the next day. The problem with this was that he was a soloist and I was just a measly 3rd player standing in his solo spot. The night block before the performance was dedicated to switching me with another 1st player in the line for the first 4 1/2 minutes of the show. 

The performance the next day was great, and so was the rest of the '03 season!

4 years later I had aged-out, proud as punch that I had stuck to my guns and spent so much quality time with a great organization. The next few Summers I taught The Academy, then the Bluecoats, and then spent 5 years at Blue Devils as a member of the visual staff. Now I get to travel the world sharing marching band with hundreds of students and teachers.

Never give up. You can never know the chain of events that will be affected by caving in. 

TL:DR I was an alternate my first year in drum corps, stuck it out and now have 3 DCI championships... and the coolest job in the world. I also drive a Dodge Stratus. ","1417392554"

If you're a fan of craft beer there tons of options here in Vancouver.  I know Calgary has some rad bars but there's very few breweries.  Here there are many breweries which have tasting rooms as well as interesting bars.  

For breweries you should check out Brassneck, 33 Acres, Main Street, Storm, Powell Street, Deep Cove, Moody Ales, Yellow Dog, Black Kettle, Steel and Oak, Dageraad, Steamworks, Four Winds and Bridge.  I think Brassneck/33 Acres/Main Street have the best tasting rooms in the Vancouver.  My favourite is definitely Brassneck followed by Four Winds.  

For bars I'd say hands down the Alibi Room.  I know St. Agustin's is popular but I hate the decor and the tvs.   Even little bars like Cafe Brixton have cheap pitchers and decent selection of beer.  There's so many in Vancouver now even compared to a couple years ago.  Matchstick Coffee Roasters opened a new shop that serves many local beers and has great coffee.  

Sorry to go on such a tangent with nothing about badminton but great beer is something the west coast does well. There's so many great breweries in this province (like Driftwood or Hoyne) that make craft beer great.  ","1417392557"

Honestly, the game gets a lot more fun and feels more valuable after you stop IAP-ing. It's like how a game stops being fun/challenging if you use cheats, and you get bored of it quickly.

"Constantine","t5_2viio","It's starting to feel like a chore to me, honestly.

The lack of an over-arching plot is really bad in my opinion. I know this is still the first season, but still, 6 episodes in you'd think they would have  an general idea about what they wanna do with the show, but apparently they don't.

Good shows *do* have an over-arching plot from early on, it's not too much to ask. Even other DC shows like Flash and Gotham, the writers seem to have a much better idea for their shows' plot.

What I also don't like about it is that it's not funny, it's not scary, there's no suspense, there's no action, etc... It's just lacking to me.

Also, while I think Matt Ryan has been doing a good job so far, the character itself, among all the others, isn't fleshed out and feels too 2-dimensional.

I'm not a bit surprised it might be cancelled. NBC didn't do it justice, sure, but the show in and of itself *should* be better. I want it to be, obviously, otherwise I wouldn't have stuck it out thus far.

If the main character's name wasn't Constantine, I would never watch another episode. The only reason I'm still watching is because it's DC, not because it's a good show.

Here's to hoping it gets better, though.","1417392560"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Your take describes what I experienced exactly. As per school protocol, I issued a student with a lunchtime detention for leaving my classroom without permission. She then chose to not attend the detention, so I issued her form tutor a slip detailing the new detention time. When she didn't attend that one either, I assigned a third one, which she did not attend. School protocol then called for us to give our students an after school detention, which in my department was served with our department head. Her father called me in a rage and swore at me over the phone, and I asserted that her behaviour was against school rules and that, as per the contract he signed when enrolling her at the school, she would be required to serve an after school detention. 

A few months later, that same father sat across from me at parent-teacher interviews while I praised his daughter for improved behaviour and generally good work in class. He was silent for the entire conference until I asked if he had any questions for me at the end. He went off on me again about the after school detention, making a scene and swearing. At least his daughter had the good sense to be embarrassed. 

The really unfortunate thing is that by the end of the year, his daughter's behaviour had started to flip and she started to act out in class - following his example. ","1417392562"

- Everyone, but most importantly Scott, wants Lin to ""step up,"" while he proceeds to play him only 30 mpg. I do not recall Lin having stamina issues and he was one of the more conditioned players coming into training camp. 

- Ed Davis is a grey area, since he picks up fouls a lot, so I don't blame him for not starting him.

- In the game against the Grizzlies, Lin started hot by controlling the ball. Offense was good in the first half (which I do believe links to defense). 2nd half comes along and Scott decides to start up his crap version of the Princeton offense out of nowhere and offense stagnates. I'm not saying rely on Lin, I'm saying stop using that crap offense that seems to always only result in a jump shot. Seriously, a jump shot is the ""optimal"" result of that play, not trying to find an easy way into the lane.","1417392563"

I'm guessing 14, but I could be wrong (right at the cusp where usually, in the past, children gave up these fictional friends - or, as s'he's doing, started to acknowledge the fiction of them).  Is it possible this person is older than that?  I ask because some of the headmates are constructed with words that show some small amount of insight that's usually seen in people slightly older than 14.  

If you guys tell me that some of these people are over 18, that's gonna take a day to wrap my head around.

"DecidingToBeBetter","t5_2tand","Career-wise why aren't you able to secure a post-doc? Is it something you're not interested in doing? It seems like your PhD is in physics or something similar, I'm not sure what the trajectory outside of academia is for physics but perhaps you could ask in r/physics. My field is in the life sciences so for us it's generally biotech and pharma but there are options in the military as well as abroad.

Relationship, stop thinking about it as something you're failing at. Just from reading your thread I think you're a wonderful person. You will be thoughtful and considerate of whoever you become involved with in the future. You talk about being a virgin as if that's a bad thing, it's not. I'm very sorry your tries with some of your close female friends were a non-starter that's very unfortunate because friends before SOs is something that I think makes a lot of sense, at least in my life. What I would like to say about this is, don't worry too much, you are absolutely not a failure.

Screw anyone else and what they're doing, this is your life, everyone takes different routes. 

Exercise, I think you should start again. 

Drinking, I think you should stop.

Miscellaneous, I think one thing that helped me was to volunteer my time, for me it was as a tutor for underserved high school students. Why do I recommend it? Because the human connection is there, you're going to enjoy doing it, you're going to feel great about yourself after you do it, and you're going to be helping someone who desperately needs your help.

Also, it will get you out of the cyclic introspective degrading thoughts and conversations you're probably having with yourself. You're going to get to talk with people that aren't yourself. The above isn't a bad thing but from my experience, when I was depressed which was for a period of 5 years, it ended 4 years ago... I did way too much of this and it was a trap and a mistake. I thought if I thought about it long enough I could reason and will my way out of it, no, seek out the human connection, find things to do that have nothing to do with yourself.

Lastly you are not a failure, don't compare yourself with other people, everyone leads different lives, as you well know some look great on paper as yours does but everyone has their relative problems and insecurities, you are absolutely not alone on this. Keep us updated, pm me, live, try living a bit more for others, if nothing else it might keep your mind off of yourself and ultimately I see loved ones and a wonderful family in your future even if you don't but to get there you need to move past this, just like music sort of passes the time when exercising, helping others does the same for living.

Also financially, supplement it with tutoring. You can charge 50 - 110 with a PhD especially if you have experience teaching which I know you do.","1417392568"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","i guess it is harsh, but not all that inaccurate. i personally just cannot stand him. he strikes me as far too much of a showman, and he has ruined many science programs i have seen him on. he has this way of explaining things in a popular science-y way that doesn't set well with me, masking the true way science is accomplished. feynman had many faults, but he was fantastic in showing how science is done without belittling his audience or the subject at hand, both of which tyson does on a regular basis.

and you're right. he doesn't strike me as someone who really wants people to increase their understanding of science in that he seems much more preoccupied in that he wants people to increase their wonder of him.

what's ironic about him moderating this debate is that i bet isaac asimov wouldn't have liked him either. i don't get the feeling that he is as knowledgeable as he thinks he is but has an ability to appear that way. isaac asimov famously said ""those people who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do.""

edit: as an elaboration of his annoyance, tyson seems so proud of himself for pointing out that roman numerals do not have a symbol for zero. but in true NGT fashion, he stretches this to imply that the roman's had not considered the idea of zero, which a [ten second google confirms that they did indeed consider zero](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Zero). it just gets tiresome of wading through his pompousness.","1417392569"

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","For a long time we were like, ""We may have another one...someday."" Then one day I was 35 and someday was NOW! After we thought it out, we decided that #1 Son is so funny and cool and so awesome, we wanted to see what we could make a second time. So #2 Son was born 3 months ago.

#1 Son is 5, so he was able to understand a lot more more than a young toddler. I know he sometimes feels a little neglected now, but his nature is such that if he resents the baby at all, he doesn't show it, just gets a tad more clingy than usual. He has been a huge help when I am trying to deal with both of them at the same time, fetching things, doing chores, watching the baby so I can make dinner. 

For us, this interval worked out well. I know some people want to get all the diapering and nursing out of the way within a couple years, but I know myself well enough to know I couldn't handle a toddler and a baby. 

If #1 Son had been a more challenging child, he might have remained an only child. It all depends on what you want. And there's no hurry, I would think it over separately and together, and have a series of discussions spanning at least several months before you come to a decision.","1417392572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Honestly, I think the whole Celsius/Fahrenheit question boils down to which you grew up with, one isn't clearly better than the other. Like you say Fahrenheit is useful because 0 is the lowest you'll be comfortable with and 100 is the hottest, that isn't any easier to remember than me knowing that I'm most comfortable at around 25°C etc. 

The only reason I see metric as clearly better than imperial is the crazy inconsistent numbering which makes converting up or down a nightmare. Since Fahrenheit and Celsius are both single unit scales in everyday use  they're pretty much equal :).

Just as a geeky side note, Kelvin is simply Celsius shifted down 230-ish degrees (232 I think but don't quite me on it) and it's zero is designed to be absolute zero and so is pretty useless outside of scientific measurements.","1417392572"

I know absolutely zero about police procedure and rules in the UK, so I can't offer educated speculation on this.

Honestly, the demeanor of medical professionals change when it's drug use related (or you happen to be a drug user and tell them). The most info you can provide will always help your care, but my experience suggests that because medical professionals tend to have very limited experience with using drugs recreationally, their attitude becomes one of respecting their Hippocratic oath more than treating the person who is  'suffering from their own choices'. perhaps because their opinion is made more of perceptions than experience which i find is largely contrary to the experience you get from doctors and nurses who make a career out of practical experience.

Alternatively, you can push the bed back against the wedge/headboard, put small tables on either side, and put a small couch at the foot of the bed.  I had a hotel like this once and it was quite pleasant. You'll probably want a carpet under the couch and possibly a small bench/ottoman under the tv that you can pull out when on the couch.

Don't forget that drapery panels (rather than a full curtain) might be desirable to frame the window and add a little softness.

"sevareign","t5_352hw","So two little ideas that I think would be cool:

Random events: Maybe a set amount of OoG time (maybe every week?) related to an in game time (maybe each IG year? Every 6 months?) a mod or GM will post ""Random Happenings"" relevant to each individual kingdom. It wouldn't take very long, and would provide a great deal of unity as we all feel that we are in this world together.  I suggest this so we don't forget we exist in a world and worlds have events that happen and having little activities to reply to can be fun for all.

Examples: Crop boom, Storms, Earthquakes, Flood, Blights, Peasant revolts, Bad omens, Good omens, Plague, Festivals, rebellious dukes, etc.

Second little idea that I feel should be shared:

I really enjoy what everyone is working on for the battle systems. However one of my most picky things is that when armies clash it feels like people just ""dissapear"" i.e. (Party a and party b fight, you lose X you lose Y). I suggest a simple calculation of ""Combatants Wounded"" So that there would be an actual need for healers (Lightbringers, etc.). This could work similar to Mount and Blade where having Lightbringers nearby increases the chance that soldiers are wounded instead of killed, or could simply be a fun little thing to mess with and RP about (Do you take prisoners? What do you do with them?)","1417392581"

However, it is fun sitting back and watching /r/austin. **I'm** trolling, but people freely post ""OMG Laura Pressley believes in God"" or ""OMG Laura Pressley presented scientific evidence contradicting the government's WTC narrative, making her a ""9/11 Truther!""  The best one was ""OMG Laura Pressley had a Ron Paul sticker on her car two years ago, so she is a Republican!"" (never mind that the Republicans hate Ron Paul just as much as the Democrats hate Lyndon LaRouche).

But when I post a bit of intentional hyperbole, to try to get people to re-think their pat answers in a philosophical *Reductio ad Absurdum*, I'm the one trolling.  Clearly, either that attempt to get people to think failed on you, or you don't want people to think for themselves.

Vote however you want.  I endorse neither candidate, nor do I think that either one will improve the lives of people in D4.

But I'm going to say again that you are not doing a good job of moderating this sub.  Your political bias is just as apparent as your racial bias.

If you want to make friends with an introvert, they are easy to spot especially during the holiday gatherings. If you see someone standing nervously alone in a kind of quiet spot, go over and say something like ""Is it ok if I stand her for a few minutes? These things make me nervous and I would feel less awkward if I was not standing alone"".  Try to make a little eye contact when approaching, but it's ok and natural to look away when expressing your discomfort. It's ok to take a deep breath and stand quietly. Maybe they are waiting for friends to arrive, or maybe you just started making a friend.

Because of space, (semi-destination) no one got +1s.

We instead had a fun weekend of hanging out as siblings and it was a lovely wedding.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; You'll be hard pressed to find any economists who would disagree with the fact that high barriers of entry discourages competition. And the illegality of a product is absolutely creating a barrier of entry.

If I start selling meth on my street corner, the risk or being attacked by the controlling gang is way higher than the risk of getting arrested. The barrier of entry here is being killed by the monopoly, not state coercion.

Violence in the mafia doesn't come about only because the product is illegal, but also because that's what ruthless people do to gain an advantage in unregulated markets. That's unfettered competition.

But let's say you are right. Still, not all barriers of entry are created by the government and regulation. There are natural barriers of entry and some monopolies can arise naturally out of those.

&gt; It's supremely easy to show how byproducts of regulation hamper and prohibit competition.

This is still not the same as what you claimed : that businesses *use* regulation in order to become monopolies, and that without regulation there would be no monopolies.

&gt; For example, there are two hotels. One large one apart of a giant corporation, and a non-chain hotel, run by grandma and grandpa. The government legislates regulation that says the elevators must pass new safety requirements at the cost of the company. The giant corporation can eat the cost of the new safety requirements, while the smaller company must pass those costs on to the consumer, causing a price increase.

Hard to believe this is an example of government regulation being a bad thing. Despite the pity that is supposed to be induced by the hotel owners' status as grandparents, I'm actually glad they have to go out of business if their elevators are harmful. Are you seriously claiming we should defend the right of businesses to make unsafe products? What about the right of customers to not die on vacation?

&gt; There are also instances of regulation also harming the consumer, rent control being a well known one.

Some regulation is bad != all regulation is bad.

Some regulation also *helps* competition, such as anti-trust laws and laws against insider trading.


&gt; And you'll be hard pressed to find any economists (aside from the Marxist variety) who believe it's a good idea to remove private property.

""Scientists (except those that believe Not P) believe P.""

Why are you excluding Marxist economists? What you're saying is : economists that agree with me agree with me.

&gt; Private property has allowed for explosions in economic grow and standards of living beyond which we've ever seen before in human history.

Tell that to slave laborers the world over. Capitalism is super for them, isn't it? You sound like 1950s US propaganda.

Also, the biggest economic growth of the 20th century came as the result of government spending in wars and the post-war economy. Things are much more complex than ""private property --&gt; prosperity"". What private property has most certainly allowed is extreme inequality and concentration of economic power, as well as mostly unaccountable and undemocratic socioeconomic organisation. What deregulation (esp. of financial markets) has brought are the 1929 and 2008 economic crashes.

You have claimed and not demonstrated that economic growth and higher standards of living are the *effects* of private property. Why not factor in technological advancement, government spending in education and other areas, social stability, U.S. imperialism, etc.?

Even if you demonstrate that claim, you still need to show that private property is *the only way* these effects can come about. If we can have prosperity without the negative effects of private property, why not choose that instead?","1417392586"

A lot of people keeps guns for protection. Not so much from the government, but from criminals. The highest crime rate cities in America have the absolute toughest gun control laws. Consequently, places with more lax gun laws, walla, tend to have a lot less crime. It does not wipe it out entirely, obviously. And, also sometimes people obtain guns legally to do horrific things. People might not need weapons to protect themselves from our own government, or a foreign one. However, the second amendment is the ONLY thing that we have to make sure we are still allowed to protect ourselves, our property and our families. America does one thing very horribly and that is telling Americans they cannot do something. So, outlawing guns will literally then make millions and millions of people instant criminals because they will not give them up. And, the criminals certainly are not going to obey.  So while some gun people are a bit koo koo, so are people from every walk of life. And, sometimes people just sound koo koo because they are not understanding that there needs to be something more than shouting FROM MY COLD DEAD HANDS. to get the point across that we do have the right to firearms and we're not just refusing to not give up our guns, we are refusing to give up our opportunity to defend what we hold dear.","1417392587"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Back in the day, *Traveler* was the hard science fiction RPG. It has since undergone many different editions, with the most recent being released by Mongoose. It has a system for randomly generating star sectors. Because of its age and position of preeminence, there are numerous supplements for *Traveler*.

*Stars Without Number* is a very popular OSR (Old School Revolution) game that can be described as D&amp;D Basic meets *Traveler* (Psychics take the place of Magic Users). I highly recommend it because it has some very good rules and advice for running a sandbox game, but combat is very lethal. The free edition is a complete game. There are also a number of free supplements as well as paid supplements.

I'm currently reading *Diapsora*, which bills itself as Fate meets *Traveler*. It does not appear to have rules for aliens. Speaking of universal systems, you should look into *Savage Worlds* and its science fiction companion/settings, as well as the d6 system (and related mini 6), which was the system used for a very popular Star Wars game. The price point of *Savage Worlds* is reasonable, and the d6 games are free.

If they were serious about no polygamy, then they would also amend the spiritual practice of it as well, allowing for only one ""sealed"" wife.... right? 

They should just fucking admit they still believe in the practice, but only banned it in the first place due to U.S. Laws and the threat of military action.

"Flipping","t5_2y9q6","Yeah, you can do ebay - there are some liquidation/wholesale sites out there too, like liquidation.com - search for a deal and be picky because it's easy to screw up and buy worthless stuff, or stuff that sits around awhile in inventory.  ebay has a wholesale site too, but requires you to apply and you need a reseller license (pretty easy to get but not sure if there is an age restriction or not).

Check out deal sites like slickdeals.net and woot (side deals only) - but be careful, all of the sites seem to say something is worth much higher than it really is so the sale price looks better.  For example, a lot of times they'll have some sweet electronics on sale, say a tablet, and it's on sale for 199, normall 399, sweet, almost 200 profit, right (minus shipping and fees)?  Do some due dillegence though, say with CamelCamelCamel or check ebay and other sites, and you'll see that nobody is selling it for 399 and the usual price is 249.  

I do almost all of my sourcing online (I work full time and have responsiblities which don't allow me to go to thrift stores more than a couple times a month - and garage sales - this isn't California or Texas, they dry up in the winter), it's possible but you gotta do your homework.

Just bought an auction for 50 bucks today, but I didn't notice was a pallet with 15 or so boxes on it, which wound up costing 300+ in shipping (saw a pic of the pallet, It just didn't ""click"").  Ouch.  I still can make a profit on it when it finally sells, but my margins will be smaller now.","1417392597"

I didn't even know it was going to launch with that cinema so now I am even more dead set on getting the GearVR. That is going to be my secret weapon for demoing it to my friends and family now. SO STOKED.","1417392597"

Then the games we should have won but were beaten I wont even get into to many specifics but for example:

2010 season after the 0:00 in the Big XII championship game against Texas. Nebraska goes into the 6th game of the season undefeated ranked number 5 playing against an unranked Texas team that has been the motivation for the entire off-season with 0:00 hanging up in the locker room. I was there for that game Memorial Stadium has never been louder than that afternoon deafening doesn't do it justice the ground was shaking from the crowd and guess what Nebraska lost 20-13 and never really had a chance to win that game.


This was repeated over and over, Michigan State this year, VT in 2010 a lot of big games that just racked up with Nebraska winning none of them.

Racking up wins against bad teams and then getting trounced by good teams and never really putting together 4 good quarters of quality football is why Bo Pelini no longer coaches for Nebraska.","1417392604"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","Look up Public House on Clark. They have a show called Bye Bye Liver that is a very popular drinking show. There's also a group called Thirsty Improv that does a drinking show at the Apollo theatre. I have not seen either of these but I hear great things about them!

Two of my favorite shows are at MCL (Musical Comedy Live- previously called Studio Be until last June, it's across the street from the Vic on Belmont and Sheffield). Sassafrass is a southern drinking variety show on Friday nights at 10:30 and VAMP is a musical improv show on Saturdays at 10:30. Both are interactive and tons of fun. MCL is BYOB so almost any show there is good for drinking and there's a liquor store down the street on Belmont!

Edit: forgot to mention if watching the actors get drunk is your main goal I would suggest checking out VAMP first :)","1417392607"

Unfortunately, the state of society and media right now is that when LGBTQ people are ""dealt with"" in cinema, it's either extremely subtle (to the point you aren't even aware of it until the director tells you in the special interview DVD) or extremely explicit and sexual.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; The amount of censorship in the UK is... Orwellian. Mock US television all you want, there is no set of media controls on US networks like the UK has. From simple ""taxes"" on various media to the publication stop-orders that UK defense and intelligence agencies can issue, there is quite a spectrum of ways for the UK government to step on stories it doesn't want to get publicized at home. Doesn't work of course, but everyone just lays down and accepts it.

This is kind of an issue but not nearly widespread enough for people to care. It's certainly not at an ""orwellian"" state yet.

&gt; Why give up Hong Kong!?!? It was the only damn colony in the 20th century that was worth anything! Yes, dump Kenya and the whole African mess, but Hong Kong?!?! Blow a billion to keep the Falklands, and give Hong Kong away for free???!?!?

Because the people of Hong Kong are Chinese and pissing off China isn't the smartest thing to do.

&gt; The House of Lords. What a scam.

Depends on your view. It's a relic of a bygone age but it still works so it doesn't really need changing.

&gt; Clinging to the special relationship. The UK gets nothing from it.

Again, relic from the Cold War. Though it looks nice what with Putin's who's got the biggest dick competition recently. 

&gt; Clinging to the Euro zone. That's WWIII in the making. You know damn well you give nary a finger-fuck about France or Germany or the rest of Europe, and they give nary the same about you. Stop pretending.

We're not clinging to it, many people want to leave it. Though that would be stupid as it would fuck our economy.

&gt; Complain about Google street view cars taking pictures and whine about privacy... say nothing of having police cameras on every corner.

We don't complain about Street view and those cameras are actually pretty useful as evidence in trials.

&gt;Whine about about a few hundred suspects held alive in Guantanmo, but say nothing about thousands ""remanded to His Majesty's permanent custody.""

That's just a saying. Being in Her Majesty's Custody just means you're in prison. Whereas Guantanamo Bay is a camp on a piece of land you don't actually own where various human right conventions are broken against ""terrorists"". ","1417392612"

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Like others have said, Common Core is an attempt to unify/standardize state curriculum. Opponents will point out its downsides, which include:

a. A single curriculum for all states must either slow down the fastest states or make the slowest states move faster than they wish.  This is especially problematic for states dealing with heavy immigrant populations that speak English as a second language (eg California). Combined with No Child Left Behind, the system errs towards slowing down the fastest states.

b. A single curriculum can potentially mean that in order to make a change at your school, you'd have to make a change at every school- people may avoid making minor improvements because of the effort it would take to implement them across the country. The US education system is clearly lacking, and standardizing before we have a working system reduces schools' ability to search for solutions.

c. There is more than one way to answer a problem or question, especially in math. A single curriculum promotes teaching a single way to solve problems for the sake of unity, which in turn has the potential to reduce mathematic curriculums to ""plug these numbers into this equation, never-mind why"".

d. At the most basic level, conservatives will opposite based on the principal that it reduces local independence.","1417392613"

It works the same way for audio signals on a headphone (aux) cable. There are only two channels being sent on your cable. Right and Left. Both the right and left channels have their own ""+"" wires.

But I always liked gadgets and technology. So much so that I paid more attention to having the coolest gear than basic amenities. 

And so. I went on a 5-day hike through Kalbarri NP in West Australia with nothing more than 5 packs of noodles, Candy, Condensed Milk with Coffee in a tube and UHF gear/ military camo packs (I wanted to be tacticool).

Day 2. 
Crash. After exhausting all my glucose supplies, I was down to Noodles as my only source of energy. I fell down a small scree slope from exhaustion on trail and my teacher noticed and called me an idiot. Then gave me some of his emergency rations; Trail mix, cured meats, grains and spices. 

I was a changed teenager overnight. I bounced back instantly it was amazing.

The quote in question, in case you can't be bothered to read through that.

  &gt; But the biggest blow to the marketing campaign came from a group of volunteers who had been involved in the vaccine’s prelicensure studies and who reported developing arthritic symptoms after the vaccination. Although the rate of arthritis in the vaccinated volunteers was the same as the rate in the control group, some Lyme disease activists concluded that the vaccine caused, rather than prevented, Lyme disease. In 1999, a class-action suit was brought against the manufacturer. Retrospective studies have shown no connection between the vaccination and arthritis, but at the time, sales of the vaccine dropped precipitously, and in 2002 the manufacturer withdrew it from the market.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Not an expert here, but I think I understand what you are asking. Basically, projection is the angle at which your tissue juts from your chest - closer to perpendicular equals more projected. Like if you stood sideways to a mirror and looked at the line where the bottom of the breast is, and from the root the tissue then went down (an acute angle), that's pendulous. If it goes basically straight out, that's projected. If it gently slopes up towards the nipple (like an obtuse angle), that's shallow.

Similarly, like others are saying, pendulous does not necessarily equate to full on bottom, because full on bottom is a statement about where the majority of your tissue sits in the whole breast. Pendulous, projected, shallow are terms about how your breast joins your chest wall. That being said, as your skin weakens over time, I suppose FoB breasts could shift towards a more pendulous appearance losing some of their projection if before they were very self supporting and that firmness is lost.

Wide and narrow (and tall and shallow) are how your roots are distributed across your chest wall - they also don't necessarily have to equate to pendulous, FoT, shallow exactly. I think the fact that there is all this information one needs to keep aware of during the fitting process is why it can be so difficult and potentially frustrating.","1417392619"

As for answering the question I have many but the one that comes to mind first because the anime is currently airing is **World Trigger**. I love the manga and while I would love to live is an alternative reality where the manga survives (sells really good) and does really good in the rankings for over 3 years and then gets an anime made by a studio like Madhouse that isn't what ended up happening. I am very glad the series got an anime and while many people have already dropped it and I have been somewhat disappointed in Toei Animation I still have watched every single episode multiple times. I have seen the newest episode which just came out yesterday a total of 3 times already. I really just love seeing one of my favorite series animated and can't wait for some of the later parts animated including my favorite character. So I do think loving an anime of this quality this much is a bit unreasonable but I just really love the series a lot that I can't help myself. ","1417392621"

The city surely is quite fun, with a lot of ways to make it work, but then again the last few points are just the same as were the first couple ones. 

Almost any map is great if you've two competent teams and high level of teamwork. Bridges demands a lot from SLs, I'd be ready to say more than any other map. Even one guy not delivering can make it almost impossible

Sadly the times when the teams are actually very even and competent are rather rare. Bridges is maybe the most infuriating map if it turns out to be total failure from one team. It still takes closer to 30 minutes to see your team delivering nothing and getting nothing done.

Maybe the biggest issue with Bridges for me is the fact it's so goddamn long. If it's really tight you will go +40 minutes with it. As I mostly play the campaign, getting Bridges just means that you'll not be playing through the whole campaign. Of course there are some other maps which I dislike for the very same reason, but then again none of them gets the same kind of ""special spot in my heart"" sort of comments.

Now I'm not saying Bridges is utter shit. It has its place and I wouldn't mind playing it every now or then. But for me it's not special compared to some other ""long and variating"" maps. ","1417392627"

Both penis and testicles sit higher up than you think they do. The penis is just a much bigger clitoris, after all, and the scrotum is made of fused-together labia.

Guys are stereotypically surprised to find that the vagina is as far down/back as it is, and it seems a hell of a lot of women are surprised to discover the opposite about our bits. 

When we stand with our legs together, all the dangly bits sit in front of our thighs. The balls might swing back mid-stride if we walk wide-stance, but only a little bit. 

The penis has a ligament at the base that doesn't really let it hang down much - it can droop when flaccid, but the base doesn't go much below 45 degrees downwards unless you make it. 

When wearing clothes, it'll tend to sit anywhere from 8:00 to 10:00 through the day.

The recovery was maybe a week of active healing, and then a few more weeks of lingering soreness before I was all better. The procedure to remove it was VERY painful--a shot of lidocaine and then cauterization with silver nitrate. I honestly found it more traumatic than childbirth. Not to scare you!

"Birmingham","t5_2r3nd","But it's a minority with some money and some power. Jimmy Filler and his foundation pledged to raise 4-5 million in the first year. Mayor Bell and the city council promised financial support, and continue to offer the land swap that would make an on-campus stadium possible. 

If they'd be honest, the BOT and Ray Watts would realize that there's at least the possibility of support out there, and would explore those options. Give the football program a 2 or 3 year deadline, for example. Set attendance and revenue goals (realistic ones) that have to be met. 

But this isn't an honest, rational decision. It's the culmination of a vendetta by one petty little man, and a spineless university president allowing it to succeed. Football is pretty unimportant in the grand scheme of things. But this gives me NO confidence that Ray Watts would stand up for UAB's interests against the BoT in any other matter. 

Eliminating the football program damages UAB's other athletic teams, and makes it a much less attractive undergraduate university. I know the west side of campus is the less powerful side, but UAB claims that it wants to increase campus appeal for undergrads.  This is a huge step in the wrong direction. ","1417392630"

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Every year, Linux gets more improved and polished. There is a steady increase in usability and quality over time and it has a very user-centric philosophy behind it.

Windows is the standard monolith that everyone is used to and deals with. It gets updated every few years and is only as good as it is because of its mainstream use. Completely owned and controlled by Microsoft, mostly to make a profit.

I personally use Linux because I'm trying to become a programmer/developer and Linux is much easier and nicer for developers to use and bend to their needs. Almost all the software, including the OS itself, is open/free; it's modular; and bash is just better than the Windows command line.

However, if you aren't programming or working as something like a dev, then I don't see Linux being that appealing unless Windows isn't working or you can't afford alternatives.

Here's what's wrong with Linux: There are only a few distros that reliably work out of the box, most applications/services still prioritize running on Windows over Linux, and gaming is still objectively less-good. Plus, I haven't had to spend hours and hours searching through old forum posts and wiki pages in order to get a feature or program working correctly in Windows.

Imo, give it 5 or 10 years and Linux will be totally viable for regular consumers and it'll probably destroy Windows, but for now it's still too finicky and complicated for regular consumers.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt; The ending confrontation was odd. It didn't come out of nowhere, but it was a little unexpected how suddenly things exploded. This would have been a good way to use the various characters and the city environment to build tension and drama over years, rather than just a blood mage mission every once in a while and then boom, mages are the core issue.

That's a nice pun at the start.

The problem was that they badly mangled the three-act story. Act one set up the Qunari as a major factor in Kirkwall's future. You also had to deal with the odd blood mage. It also set up the expedition as a big deal. Then the expedition was quickly over and never talked about again. And then act two was about the Qunari problem - and then that problem was *resolved*. So, the key thing that had a visible influence on how Kirkwall changed actually ended up not being the main plot. The main plot ended up being what was a previous subplot that suddenly got thrust into the forefront.

It would be like defeating the Empire at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, and then Return of the Jedi is entirely about Greedo's family out for revenge. It's a jarring shift to the narrative, particularly because even the promotional material made it out like the Qunari were *the* big deal.","1417392635"

**1. What's the cheapest mode of transportation toget around?**  
Walk. Prepare your feet for a gruesome all-day walking! :D  
**2. What's are the places we should not miss?**  
Aside from the top tourists destinations, Malls (SM Baguio is one of the best observatory you can find in the center of the City), you should try some of the authentic food such as the ""Pinikpikan"".  
**3. What are the expected expenses?**  
P450x2 - Transpo Manila - Baguio vv.  
P250-1500* - for cheap transient houses and or budget inns and hotels.  
That's all! Just prep some budget for food and if you'd go shopping (don't miss the Night Ukay-Ukay @ the Harrisson Road!).  
**4. Do we need to reserve bus tickets going there and going back?**  
There are many busses so I think you'll never need reservations. If you'd like you can.  
**5. And this might be too much, but do you have a packed itinerary you can recommend?**  
Just enjoy the place. One trip is not enough for Baguio. Hindi mo malilibot ang boong Baguio in less than Two days! :D  
.

The article is about friendships and sexualization. My comments have addressed that directly. You have taken my comments and applied them to your own tangent about the value of therapy. 

My story was directly relevant. It has nothing to do with insecurity. Instead it has to do with an acute understanding of how the world works. Yes, I prayed and was granted grace and my heart was strengthened through a serious personal issue, which happened to be related to physical attraction and attachment. 

At no point have I mentioned intercessory prayer. Stop putting words in my mouth. If you're not gonna open your mind and heart to a greater reality, I can't convince you or force you nor am I interested in doing that.  But don't pretend to address what I am saying via unrelated tangents. 

Meditation and prayer are slightly different. I am already self-aware. Meditation is just exploring my insides more deeply. Prayer is taking those insides and offering them to the Father.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","In the hands of equally capable people, Emperor would win. 

[Spoiler pt3:](#s ""Hol Horse fires several bullets down a tube according to a prediction made by Tohth. These bullets travel down the pipes together, controlled by him, and end up backfiring (much like in the case of Oingo) by hittim himself in the head. The bullets stop short though, and Hol Horse isn't killed, but he is put out of commission for the remainder of pt3."")

So, now we know that Emperor can do several things: Fire multiple rounds, control multiple rounds, isn't limited by ammo. These rounds can also shift direction, however, it's noted that these are curves, rather than redirections, which are much sharper and more exact than curving. So, Emperor has less accuracy. 

Compared to Sex Pistols: Limited by ammo, six possible redirections, *requires a weapon*.

Emperor is a much higher quality Stand, and it fits into the idea that Araki goes with: The bad guys are always more powerful. It's the hero outwitting the more powerful villains that makes for a great fight.

Hol Horse is a bit of an idiot with his stand, but when it comes to which is better, Emperor, hands down. It may not have the accuracy that Sex Pistols can achieve, but it's changes to trajectory are unlimited, as well as it's ammunition, and it doesn't require a pre-existing weapon to provide the initial velocity.

To boil it down, Emperor is a gun with infinite ammo that can fire several controllable bullets.

Sex Pistols is a stand that allows the redirection of small projectiles, which can be used up to six times before a cooldown (reload) is required. 

It's pretty obvious which is more powerful. Hol Horse is just inept. ","1417392637"

...What? you clearly are new here. It is a pretty common complaint on this subreddit especially.

Good for you, such people deserve it.

&gt;  BTW, you brought up your college status, nobody else. I couched my initial responses in my real world experience, and I still stand by my statement that you don't know shit about reality.

I brought it up in relation to the fact i'm a young guy living away from home, I live with a roommate so obviously how can I have ever claimed domestic abuse? you are the one who seems to think i'm some weird college shut in that goes off what books say and never leaves the flat.

How can someone not know shit about reality? i'm mentally healthy, not on any drugs or medication, so yeah i'm experiencing reality as it should be, you on the other hand keep saying things about me that you just made up on the spot to fit whatever preconceived notion you have about me.","1417392641"

I have heard the claim that some American accents are closer to how English was commonly spoken at the time when Britain still had The Colonies.

you are not white, and therefore you are not afforded a luxury allowing you to conduct yourself as you please without said conduct being attribute to your race.  you will never have that privilege!  your behavior, does, however, feed into various stereotypes of black people: light skin, straight hair, and light colored eyes are considered ideal among blacks.  aka, black people will spend thousands on skin lightening treatments, hair care, and resort to contacts in an effort to ""lessen"" their blackness, and claim whiteness.  let me guess, on grindr you list ""Mixed"" as your race.  and you do that, probably, failing to ever consider its true implications:  ""Mixed"" for when you are actually ""Black"" represents A) acknowledging the racism within the gay world, b) racism outside of the gay world, c) concluding your chance of finding someone is limited, and finally d) in order to reverse the limited interest you'll garner, you begin distancing yourself from your race.  those responding your profile or whatever, i'm sure of this, know deep down what you're doing there.  they probably pity you.  and often will continue to engage in conversation with you not because of an interest, rather solely to not hurt your feelings.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","The most powerful are the dragon aspects, they are basically gods. Empowered by the Titans who basically made the world the way it is, they are basically the lords of their element as assigned by the Titans and nothing in HS comes close to challenging the power of them.

1. Deathwing, aspect of Earth is the most powerful one as he is corrupted by the Old Gods and gone super mode. It took the combined effort of all the other aspects + friends to take him down.
2. Alexstraza/Malygos/Nozdormu/Ysera, the other aspects, rating them together although I guess their powers could maybe be argued.

3. Cenarius/Ragnaros/Jaraxxus. This one I can't decide, Cenarius is a demi-god that seemingly doesn't die, Ragnaros is basically the aspect of fire but he is still a lieutenant of the old gods, Jaraxus is the current lord of the burning legion. Thing about J-rax is that he has very little behind him, the 2 other eredar lords were total badasses and J-rax is just a random one thrown in with very little lore(although hes apparently the same rank, so must be quite powerful). Personally I would say Cenarius/Rag &gt; Jrax.
4. Al'Akir, wind Raggy although he is specifcally stated multiple times to be the weakest of the elemental lords(fun fact, Rag is the next weakest!)

5. Onyxia, I'm just putting her here as shes the daughter of Deathwing and probably 3rd most powerful black dragon ever, dragons are typically pretty badass.

6. Kel'Thuzad / Ilidan, I'm rating them equally since Kel'Thuzad is an incredibly powerful and inteligent lich whereas Ilidan is just superpowered by the skull of Guldan. Arthas beat up Ilidan before he became the Lich King so I'm rating mr Demon Ilidan equal to Arthas lieutenant at that time.

7. Gruul, hes a massive ogre demi-god, pretty simple I think he can smash anyone below him.

8. Grom, for just an orc he has done some crazy stuff with his demon blood, hell he ""killed"" cenarius!... although the C-dog didnt care much for dying and came back like it never happened.

9. Antonidas/Tyrion/Sylvannas/Velen/Baron Geddon - I can't really decide between these guys, but they are here because every legendary that isn't above them is definitely weaker than them.

Everyone else DOESN'T MATTER!

First off, people and things moved at a slightly faster speed, making evertything look weird.

In a system dominated by external assessment controlled by a government agency the interests of big business will always speak louder. 

&gt;The debate on assessment is, in the last analysis, a debate about teacher professionalism.  If the professional status of the teacher is to have any meaning, the teacher should be actively involved in all four aspects of the curriculum mentioned earlier - setting aims and objectives, choosing content, discovering the best teaching and learning methodologies and implementing the most suitable assessment and examination modes.  The essence of professionalism is a commitment to serve the best interests of one’s client group, and  to do this effectively, the professional needs to have the necessary knowledge and skills, the freedom to use his or her own judgement and the opportunity to act in conjunction with fellow professionals. Arguably teachers cannot claim the status of professionalism until they assume their full responsibility towards all aspects of the curriculum, and this includes assessment.  The concern of the Shannon and Dublin curriculum centres to involve teachers in new forms of assessment was always in the context of enhancing their professional status and giving them more ownership of the curriculum.

3 had lots of small gameplay improvements -- it had the best inventory management and combat, but the jump was less than 2 was over 1. And the main plot missions are better than ME2 for sure, but having the Reapers mid-invasion made me feel like I shouldn't take side missions, and the ones that were there weren't as good as ME2's.

EDIT: I didn't mention 1 much there. It had the most boring side missions, and my least favorite crew. I actually enjoyed Vega, whereas I was really bored by the likes of Ashley and Kaiden.

They even killed the rightful leader of Russia, Czar Nikolas II. There is no way to remove the Bolsheviks from Russia. We are far too outstretched and I fear that we will fight two fronts. This will be a blessing to the Germans. I can only do a minimal defence force on the border and set up small raids against them. I shall tell my plans to Prime Minister Borden about my new plan for minimal defence.

-Brigadier General Thomas Harper, CSEF

Thank God the Russians are at war with us. Thanks God Alaska is in America. We saved a lot of our boys from the sea and just use the small water crossing at the Bering Strait and stay near the coast away from the Japanese. As long as we are under radar, Japan will not attack our convoy. Alaska is a lifeline for them. Without it, I'm sure Hitler has pushed through Moscow and his now on the top of the Urals rolling down to the fields of Siberia. The war is going pretty badly still but with every little ounce of help we can give to them, I'm sure we can win this war with Hitler's head on the spike and Japanese ladies by my side.

-Charles Otis Thomson, USAAF

Dear Molly,
   If war does happen, please try to drive as far away from the cities as much as possible. I think the HQ is thinking of launching an attack in Alaska and taking it before we attack Cuba. NATO already has its forces at the borders in Europe and Canada is with us. Please kiss Jack and Lizzy for me if I don't return. I can only send short letters to you now and I might not be able to send you letters now, darling.

With unending love,

Edward Winston

A lot of illegal crossing. We are receiving an average of 1000 persons per day, mainly children and parents crossing the Russian-Canadian border. All of them claim refugee status but we can't take them anymore. Most of them are heading to the United States and they are not willing to help with the situation. We don't have enough blankets, food, shelter for them. I fear that they might freeze to death. Lieutenant, please tell the commander that this situation is unprecedented. All of them are starving and are escaping the oppressive government of The President. With all of strength, sir, please tell the commander, the prime minister, heck, even NATO, to help us with securing the refugees.

Sincerely,

Captain Leonard Rogers","1417392662"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Psalm 82: God passes judgement on the other gods. Very clearly, there are other gods but this passage places God as the god of judgement (as opposed to the god of war, the goddess of love, the god of rain, etc ad naseum). Kinda ties in real nice with ""Thou shalt have no other gods before *me*"" saying, yeah, go ahead and pay respect to these other gods but I'm first (it's not a commandment of monotheism as that comes later).

Oh how the south would be different if people paid more attention to that.

Or how about where Jesus killed the fig tree for not giving him fruit (hey, it was out of season because there is a time for everything was just so cliche, right?).

Or maybe how God promised the Hebrews meat and killed all of the people that ate it (https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Numbers+11). (God answers your prayers and kills you for it)

Ooh, I know, about about how the whole book of Ruth was specifically written to be a piece of historical fiction.

Or maybe how there are 3 versions of the 10 commandments. And how it's really a suzerain treaty.

He will admit that he has issues, but he gets offended REALLY easily and becomes defensive about any kind of advice/criticism.  He also usually turns it back on me.

Politifact, which I linked, called them ""Weasel Words"", for a very specuific reason.  I don't have to know what your message history is to know what your agenda is. While I don't support the president as my chosen representative, I still acknowledge he is the President, and not ""Barry"" as is a typical practice in the passive-aggressive partisan atmosphere of those wishing to promote their disagreement. As for jobs, the term ""shovel ready"" is simply political hyperbole, and of the 5 Million jobs that we on all sides have created in the last 6 years, I'm sure plenty of them are ""shovel ready"" as is possible. That being said, shortly after the President took office, he [said](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-no-such-thing-as-shovel-ready-projects/) there are ""No Such Thing as Shovel-Ready Projects"", a point that the people this particular talking point relies on typically forget to acknowledge.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","This sub really hates on hunters for whatever reason, don't let it hold you back from asking though.

I believe you already hit on some of the points yourself. Dropping a Kill Command for an extra Cult Master seems quite bad.  
Despite how awesome Cult Master plays are when you pull it off, it is a very situational card and it can sit dead in your hand for many turns.

Sludge Belcher is often a better card in that position and it can really help you on the mirror. It is also a lot more reliable and it sinergyzes with your snake traps.

Loatheb is great and you should really include it in 90% of your decks. You don't talk about Scavenging Hyena though and I believe Ironbeak Owl is a much stronger card.

Again, it is not such a flashy card but it stops enemy taunts and can turn the game around if you silence important minions (Highmanes vs hunters, Drakes vs handlocks...). It is again much more reliable and better by itself.

The Snipe is your personal preference and if it has done you well, go for it, but Freezing Trap is a more reliable card and it sets your opponent back a lot more than Snipe does. Playing Snipe from hand slows you down a lot.

Wolves vs Jugglers decision depends on what you run in the rest of your deck but since you are running double Snake Trap, their combination with Juggler is really good and scary for your opponent.  
Juggler is indeed random but you must use it to your advantage, using Spiders or Traps to help you out with extra hits. It can turn the game for you with its randomness.

Lastly, Hunter's Mark is a good card and probably worth running over the second Belcher, but you must try the first Belcher first to know about it.

I would take out Cult Masters, Wolves and Hyenas for 1 Belcher, 1 KC, Owls and Jugglers. Also swap the traps.  
This is my take on it though, and it might suit you more to change the cards in a different way. I tried to make valid points though my post.","1417392669"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I smoked for the psychadelic/intellectual feeling I got from it. It felt like I understood the world in a more cool way when I was high. 

I stopped because I realized that feeling good/smart for 20 minutes, before getting super tired was not worth it. It made me lethargic even when I wasn't smoking, and it was hard to sleep well.

I quit because I realized it made me more cloudy than clear-headed, and that it was making it hard to do well in school.

I don't regret stopping at all. I think everything I've learned via marijuana, or the extremely sensual senses you get while high, are totally possible while completely sober. It just takes work and discipline and practice to get there. The difference is, if you train yourself to be perceptive and see the world clearly, you get to always be like that. With weed, you might get cool insights for a short time, but then you'll be tired or have to smoke again.

If you like collectible card games, Hex is pretty cool - but there isn't a group function.

For thought-provoking group play, there aren't many that fit the bill and aren't just other (often inferior) MOBAs like LoL. You might try Smite because it's 3D rendition is such a neat change of pace, but I think you'll find it intense too. The other option as people mentioned is an MMO, like WoW (which I previously replied is on sale for $5 right now).

What is *considered* and *accepted to be* a human right depends on the culture of an area, and a culture will sometimes be tied to a geographic area and a government. That government may issue statements about human rights, and it may consider human rights as a basis for law. For example, in the USA, our founding principles include the axiom that we have an inalienable right (ie human right) to life and liberty, so if the government wants to kill us or imprison us, it should have a tough time to prove it's okay.

Right now, the two teams who'll definitely be entering the EULCS are Giants, n!faculty, Meet Your Lublin Reason Makershores Gaming and H2K. None of these names have been very impressive in the past, or in the expansion tournament itself. The competition has just been shit and the EU challenger scene itself seemingly void of talented teams.

And the EULCS itself isn't better. CW has been systematically losing their star players to richer organisations with better rosters. Gambit has been in steep decline since Alex left, replacing all the M5 players with honestly mediocre challenger players. I don't expect much out of UoL either. Nobody knows what's going to happen to Fnatic. SK is a ticking timebomb with 4/5 players having displayed extreme toxicity in the past and no one to really keep it in check. SHC is looking to be a worse version of Alliance by removing Impaler, with mechanically skilled players, but hardly any tactical insight.

Both put heavy emphasis on the idea of a capsule wardrobe and it's a useful concept.  If you're doing a major purge yearly and turning around and getting rid of most of what you bought a year later, it sounds like you're either buying a lot of trendy and/or poorly made items or that you're just not happy with your purchases.  Getting a skeleton wardrobe of clothes you love, that fit properly, and that will last over several seasons will help give you a jumping off point.  After that, you can look at new trends and colors and just edit your wardrobe a bit, swapping newer pieces in for things you're not as happy with now.  You obviously don't have to limit yourself to 33 items, but it's a good starting off point, especially since you can see what other people do with those items.","1417392675"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Round 1: I might give this to Supes and WW. They all have very close strength, but Wonder Woman is a great fighter and Superman is the only one who doesn't need weapons so he's equally dangerous. I think Herc's durability is super amped with some of his magic garments, but without it Heat Vision could probably take him out. Thor still has lightning control without Mjolnir but less controllable. Herc and Thor are physically stronger but WW's fighting skills should be helpful, plus Superman can dodge magic lightning if he needs to and he's the most versatile. 

Round 2: Mjolnir is potentially a game changer, I can see Superman getting K.O'd by Mjolnir or magic lightning now that Thor can focus it. Wonder Womans sword is insanely powerful too, IIRC Amazonian Steel is the most durable metal in all fiction, it might be able to cut Thor. I dunno about Herc though because his magic garment I think makes him 100% invincible, like Juggernaut's durability, literally nothing can harm him. I think. I might give it to Herc and Thor, because Herc easily has the best durability now and I doubt even Wonder Woman or Superman can tank a couple full power hits from Mjolnir. ","1417392675"

From my perspective, you have a really nice, full head of hair. Like you said, you might have some genes that will cause MPB at an early age. And it might. But to start worrying about it at this stage will not benefit you at all. 

Seeing the first signs of balding can be frightening, trust me I know. But even if this is a first sign of balding, which might turn out to be nothing at all, it's so minimal that it's not even worth the trouble of worrying about. And even if it is, you'll have plenty of time before it's bad enough that it's even noticeable.

Enjoy your hair. If it happens, it happens. Go with the flow, my brother.","1417392676"

You misunderstood what Mango_Flame is saying. He/She/It is stating that what is important is not the constitutional law that's been granted to us via our founding fathers and rooted into the core of our American culture and has been in place long before his/her/it's birth. What's important to all the people and the reason our rights are being denied to carry is because of the fantasy that might possibly happen with someone that is intoxicated and irresponsible. 

In conclusion, 

The fantasy that there might possibility be an irresponsible drunk person accidentally discharging their weapon on a Friday Saturday or Sunday is more important than the actual law itself, the constitution, our culture, and law biding citizens having the ability to protect themselves.

"PowerMetal","t5_2qwe4","**3rd place: Fairyland - Score to a New Beginning**
Fairyland's final album is better than their previous two put together. It's one of those albums I usually want to listen all the way through rather than listening to separate tracks randomly. It's got a very impressive line-up with like 7 guest vocalists, genius musical composition, super-uplifting melodies and symphonic elements. The title track is so good it's unreal, it's so uplifting and so incredibly fantastic. Assault on the Shore is equally fantastic, and most of the rest of the tracks are great.

**2nd place: Masterplan - Aeronautics**  
Jørn Lande is my favorite vocalist, ever. The guy is so incredibly talented and is just the king of metal. Everything he touches turns into gold. Aeronautics is pure gold, tons of kick-ass tracks.

**1st place: Heavenly - Virus**  
This album is the epitome of power metal, imo. The opening song (The Dark Memories) is just insane and is pretty much my favorite song ever, in any genre. It's got the catchy Spill Blood on Fire and the super badass title track. The first 8 tracks are top-tier stuff, most consistent album I've ever listened to.","1417392679"

Yes when someone tries to take the rights of an American we don't lay down, protest and revolt don't qualify as being bitches. It was ruled that even British police do not have the right to self defense therefore can not have guns. Agreeing with an argument because the opposition is stronger than you is being a bitch, agreeing that you have no right to self defense is being a bitch. 
I will agree we have a problem with violence in the US but guns are no more the problem than football in your country. At the end of the day armed Grandmothers in the US can stand up to a pack of violent men. Guns are the only thing that truly make people equal.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sure. I don't know if Pakrat is a great example. Despite being a Mindcracker, he's still a pretty small channel and he doesn't get a lot of views.  If he wasn't on Mindcrack I don't know that he'd have much of a following at all. But Pause, on the other hand, can just stream Binding of Isaac and get tons of viewers just by being himself, and that's because he's already got the fanbase. He could stream himself playing almost anything and get the views.  That doesn't mean it's easy, it's just hard in different ways.  If you've ever tried to be entertaining while playing a video game for 4+ hours while staying funny/upbeat and engaging your audience and performing well ... it's not easy.  

And a lot of times you can be exceptionally talented and people still don't watch.  Half of YouTube/streaming is who you know/luck, and half is actually having talent.  I won't say that it's a hard job in the way that construction is hard work, but it's definitely harder than a lot of people assume. You don't get to really take a day off. If you don't feel like playing Minecraft/putting out a video, people crap all over you. (See how much crap Pause or Milbee get for not doing Mindcrack videos.)   Most people want to play Minecraft for a few months in a big burst, then leave it alone to do something else for a while and come back to later when inspiration strikes. You can't really do that when it's your daily income. People want to see Minecraft, they watch for that. If you don't put it out they complain/stop watching.  You have to enjoy it, or pretend you enjoy it. And all the while you've gotta deal with people sending you hateful comments every day because you didn't see a diamond vein, or you died, or you killed Etho, or any other number of things. You could build and amazing castle but all anyone wants to talk about in the comments is how dumb you are for being killed by a Creeper, etc.

There's also a ton of networking that has to happen. If you can't network you don't get very far.  There are some outliers, but a lot of networking is a huge part of a channel's growth. So you have to be charismatic and talented and make people want to know you and work with you. not always easy, especially if you're an antisocial/awkward nerd, etc.

It also doesn't pay well until you've got at least 50,000 regular subscribers. That's not easy either.  It's fun, but it can be a very difficult thing to do fulltime.","1417392682"

Kanon is trying to deal with her anxiety for dancing in public and finally explains exactly why she doesn't want her mom learning that she's a hip hop dancer. Pretty much the entire episode is her being afraid, and then finding out there's nothing to be afraid of.

I think this would have been a bit better if they hadn't already addressed Kanon's nerves in the first few episodes. It feels like running over a problem that was already mostly solved. They also made the lame move of *not* having her mom find out she dances yet, just everyone else on the planet. Wonderful, we get to postpone this melodrama for another episode... 

I'm glad the artists took advantage of this opportunity to draw some nice clothes for the crew. Kumo in particular was looking spiffy. In this epsiode in particular I noticed the artists really seem to be trying to give every single person a unique look. Even random strangers who's faces are shown for all of two seconds all have their own individual head shape, hair style, skin tone, nose and eyes. It's a nice touch.

But, I think it's pretty obvious that the Florida board of Governors does not operate with the level of bias and singular focus as the UA system board of trustees. That said,

&gt;is that the school's fault?

Well, how can anything be the fault of a school? A school isn't an actor, it's an institution, comprised of many actors. I might rather say that it's the fault of the graduates that the school has produced, and the culture that is present within and around the school, that would lead to an institution like the Alabama BoT who behave in the way they do. The UA BoT is welded to UAT. I don't see it as legitimate for you to separate their actions when it so incredibly clear what the agenda of the UA BoT is, and where that agenda originates.

Question, if the brass at UAT had an ethical problem with the way the BoT behaves, why don't they speak out about it? Maybe (just maybe) its because they're of like minds. I mean that makes sense, doesn't it? Since the board is responsible for identifying candidates for high-ranking positions at UAT? You know? I mean why would you hire someone that will go on to be critical of your most unsavory practices? 

&gt;So I ask you once again: if the State University System decided to start playing favorites toward the school in Gainesville, is that the school's fault?

I think that if you think really hard about the framing of this question you might eventually arrive at the problem with the BoT/UAT relationship in the state of Alabama.

&gt; You're not making any sense and are acting like a childish tool about it

Consider a modern example, USA goes to war with Mexico, takes about enough land for 1 or 2 new states.

Logically, it's best to create a subject nation, and integrate them later (release vassal + integrate).

But in the case of direct annexation, people living there are now American subjects, but American government doesnt know who they are yet. Eventually they will all become american citizens, but right now they see themselves as oppressed people, with a different language, different religion and different ideology. As they enter US society, they may come into conflict with americans, this creates resentment towards government for both parties towards the government, and in places with already high unrest, revolutionaries, nationalists etc uprisings will not be that surprising.

1 or 2 states worth of conquest isnt that much compared to overall population, but it can certainly have a major. Consider this situation in 1600, where most people dont know how to write, administration will be much more difficult, the problem will be even larger.","1417392684"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; For the workers, not so much. They don't have the means to be a capitalist, so they sell out their labor and receive a wage, unrelated to the amount of value they put in to the commodities they produced, that pales in comparison to the capitalists' profit, they get the fruits of their labor stolen from them, and a whole bunch of nasty stuff along with the good.

Since workers can become capitalists and vice versa, as well as being both at the same time, this argument doesn't hold.

Also, if I save for 20 years to buy a truck as a *worker* then pay a person to load the truck. Why should I be forced to give him the same percentage of the profits then me as the driver? I saved for the truck, I trained to driver trucks, he just loads it with my help.","1417392685"

"nursing","t5_2ra72","&gt;  You should be doing it because you want to and enjoy helping others

It's perfectly valid for this to be a secondary reason, as long as it's up there somewhere. 

Nurses who bare themselves to the bone every day for the sake of others with no other consideration may burn out. 

Your statement is akin to saying that it's not valid to join the military unless you want to kill people. It's quite polarizing and very black and white, and does not take into account the myriad and perfectly valid reasons one may become a nurse. For some nurses, helping someone may be secondary. This doesn't mean that they are bad nurses. It may mean that they are interested in doing a job and making a paycheck.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","IIRC, a big reason as to why GTA V and Halo 4 looked so good was because they required you to install a heavy portion of the game in advance. Halo 4 could only look so good if they were able to fit the entire single player on one disc and throw the multiplayer on another. When you install GTA, your console is able to recall data a lot quicker than it would be reading an optical disc for its content. 

It really is a wonder how developers were able to make their games look as good as they did. Even with some work arounds, old hardware is old hardware. If you look at a game like Halo 4, GTA, or Uncharted (to name a few) you can tell that the publishers pretty much gave each studio a blank check to make the games look as good as they did. 

It really excites me to see what a game might look like if it were designed for modern hardware. I think once developers drop support for previous generation consoles and focus on the current gen and PCs, you'll see better graphics. Unfortunately, the problem is that consoles are inherently limiting. By today's standards, it's hard to compete with newer hardware, even after a couple years. I guess we'll see what happens, but I wouldn't be surprised if we saw ""upgraded"" hardware a la the Nintendo 64's upgraded RAM unit from back in the day... Something along those lines haha.

Make sure if you can to get them fitted and properly installed if you can. If not take your time with the initial install and with proper maintenance they will last forever.  I always feel secure and the power transfer from foot to pedal is great and very comfortable. Also I like the 2 sided design that makes snapping in a breeze. You can adjust how easily or not it takes to get out of them and generally the more you get used to them the less play you can put In them to snap out.  Honestly you really won't be able to do much with tennis shoes on and these pedals. Perhaps a really quick ride going slow to the store but not much more. These pedals really are not the best choice if you want to do any real rides without being clipped  in . Other then that I highly recommend them. ","1417392688"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Well, the behaviour of any program I could possibly write would be something that ""I programmed"", pretty much by definition. 

Sure, in less trivial cases the exact consequences of my programming could be more difficult to infer from the sourcecode (and, quite possibly, entirely beyond my own ability to predict); but I don't see how this is relevant to the problem of consciousness. After all, *my* personal ability or lack thereof in predicting some other entity's behaviour should not have any effect on their status as a conscious or non-conscious entity. 

But there is an even worse problem, I think. Suppose that this time I wrote a program that extracts random words from a dictionary (or even random letters from the alphabet) and strings them together in (usually nonsensical) sentences, again and again. 

Then I would have no ability whatsoever to predict what the program would do next; and while it would take a frankly insane amount of time, eventually this program *would* generate that question -- which, this time, could not be found in the code at all. 

Yet, I think that we are in agreement that this new program would not be conscious either - it's just generating random strings, nothing more. ","1417392694"

"transgamers","t5_2scaw","Good old typical ignorance, perhaps not directly malicious but destructive nevertheless. I guess posting with evidence would help clear up these issues as it has been said. As with most trans understanding most of the issues stem from misunderstanding what it means to be trans. People rely on sterotypes and assumption instead of facts. Education is important and I wish more people were better educated about WHY people feel that way inclined and what their reasons are for potential transitioning. Maybe one day it'll be as well understood as being gay. Sure, there will still be bigots, just as there are for gay people, but at least it won't be people who consider themselves tolerant and whom fundamentally believe in equality, yet feel trans people are ""wrong"" due to lack of understanding. It bugs me how conceptual being trans is, because it makes it an incredibly difficult thing for people to explain to other people well. Even trans people themselves struggle with explaining. I guess we as trans people need to try our best to educate those around us and over time; people will slowly begin to understand. So 

I ask everyone to consider learning about what it means to be transgender for you AND for others. Dispel myths, shatter stereotypes, provide facts and reason. In time we can help promote positive equality for trans people throughout society, where we won't be simply the butt of jokes, the people who are often disregarded as freaks and deviants. I would suggest helping with activism but often trans activism is tainted with excessively vocal proponents, extreme views, poor reasoning and discussion, poor use of language, which can and has actually damaged mainstream view of trans people significantly.

With my Maraduers I try to take an extra step past the enemy and start attacking so its sandwiched between both chars. WoW has something called interact with target that makes this much easier.

He was a little rescue kitty, so I'm pretty sure he was separated from his mom way earlier than he naturally would have been under normal circumstances. His sister (not biological and a couple weeks older) was found abandoned within two days of her birth and was hand raised, but she doesn't ever suckle on anything.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","There are some pretty good ways to handle missing data within IRT (and related approaches - I am not a Rasch modeler but I interact with more than a few on a regular basis), though you'd need to calibrate the items first - that still wouldn't mean respondents would need to complete every discrimination task. It would require some test takers that can discriminate at higher bitrates, sure, but there are many individuals out there that claim the ability. Once calibrations are made, it won't be necessary to offer more than a small fraction of possible items to any particular participant (more will give more confidence in their scores, of course).

&gt; The staircase method and IRT are similar in that items are of varying difficulty, although in IRT the difficulty is determined by how people respond whereas in the staircase method the difficulty is **pre-known** (e.g. signal strength difference, or in this case bitrate - which does assume 160kbps is harder than 128kbps which is harder than 96kbps).

I'd say this is a testable hypothesis - the amount of signal strength difference is known, but how hard it is for a human to detect isn't. This may vary for a variety of reasons (point in the audible frequency range, complexity of passage, partial hearing loss in a certain range, etc), or it just might not be as simple as we might expect for unknown reasons. Techniques like IRT (or CFA, or some other latent variable measurement framework) can let us test those hypotheses, and more over, they can help us identify situations where the real world deviates from our expectations (i.e. what should be an easy discrimination task isn't), which leads to better theories about what is going on.

&gt; Sorry if that comes across as a bit gibberish-y. Hot weather -&gt; terrible sleep.

That said, I don't want to throw a bunch of cash at the format to see what sticks and instead have pretty much decided that I'm either going to build U/W heroic or nothing at all. I have the flooded strands necessary just from drafting so that seems to reduce my investment cost by quite a bit.

My questions: is it currently a tier 1 deck on MTGO and does it hold up against the MTGO meta game (I'm not sure if this is an answerable question)? Is there deck list that is currently seen as best?

Also, I guess a question I should ask are there any other budget tier 1 decks (less than 100 tickets online)?

I think the whole scandal around pros cheating definitely has the potential to hurt the scene, but I think that'll only really be in the short term. Valve seems like they're wising up a bit more as far as detecting cheats and enforcing restrictions on them. I imagine the game growing like it is will serve to motivate them to try and keep the scene as clean as possible so as not to lose viewers and tournament sponsors/organizers.

I still wonder if Valve will consider making the game Free to Play any time soon. As it is they have the same sort of free to play structure in place with skins and cases similar to what they did with TF2 and Dota 2, so it's not like it would require *too much* change as far as how the game works. I think the big concern that Valve might have that would prevent it going F2P is just how big the cheat/botting ""industry"" is for the game. 

Making it F2P would likely mean that more people could skirt around bans (at least temporarily before switching to a new account), though like I said that could be much less of an issue if Valve continues building up their anti-cheat measures. I feel like one of the bigger reasons that CS and SC2 (and maybe a case could be made for Street Fighter, though I think that's a bit of a different beast) haven't quite been able to touch LoL and Dota numbers these days is because of the requirement to purchase the game.","1417392711"

"CubeWorld","t5_2t4bs","Your argument makes me laugh. You do know that the only reason he released it when he did is because people wouldn't shut the hell up about wanting him to release SOMETHING, right? So he did, now he's working on the rest of the game. He didn't say he would be updating you all the time, he didn't promise a date for the release. To me, most of you just look like a bunch of kids that can't wait and just because you got screwed over by another developer, you think every dev that doesn't constantly update you on their progress, took your money. News flash, games never used to have open development like there is today. He could develop the game for the next 10 years and release it before the world ends if he wanted to, but he's been nice enough to at least give you SOMETHING to enjoy and look up to, and in my eyes, that's plenty.

If he wants to take a long time to get as much as he can in the game, then so be it, i'd take polish over a rushed copy any day.","1417392713"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I'm very glad you brought this up, and I would if I knew how to articulate it. I think that not considering this aspect is a blind spot in radicals such as ourselves.

Here's what comes to my mind - I think there are already awful instincts that exist within human kind, which have been tamed. Maybe not 100% but at least somewhat. Ethics overcome the instincts, and/or the instincts get sublimated into a civilized outlet.

For instance, though the details are still a hotly debated topic in our society, men socially dominating women has come to be unacceptable. Is it a natural instinct for men to want to dominate, and for women to want to be dominated? If so, it still is at odds with women's sense of dignity (even if dignity is an instinct, nobody said instincts couldn't contradict each other). So it's become socially unacceptable.

But behind the bedroom door, whatever happens, thankfully, it's become a social convention that whatever weird thing you're into, you're into, and nobody should judge you, so long as there's *consent*. Here is where otherwise unpleasant or even unethical instincts can play out in a civilized manner.

So the question is, can we sublimate these instincts to have leaders? Can there be ""safe"" leaders in society? Perhaps church leaders? CEOs? These people already exist today. Tribal belonging? Ethnic social clubs exists without the state as well, and it can be peaceful. It irks me from my hyper-individualist standpoint, but as long as people recognize it for whatever irrational thing it is, and just do it because they feel better, it's cool with me.

I think we need to consider these questions further though.","1417392713"

"nintendo","t5_2qhnk","I'm not really understanding the difference between spending money to get Nintendo to fix your gamepad and spending money to buy a replacement. The only notable advantage to being able to buy one is not having to wait for the shipping and actual repair. But that would depend on stores having them in stock, which would be slow-moving stock if it even sold at all, since I doubt many people would buy replacements often.So really, the two options I see are Nintendo offering to repair the gamepad for a fee, or Nintendo offering extras for sale on their site, both of which offer nearly the same level of convenience. The purchase would possibly take slightly less time than the repair.","1417392713"

Thou shalt worship no other god.

Thou shalt make thee no molten gods.

The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep.

Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day rest.

Thou shalt observe the feast of weeks.

Thrice in the year shall all your men children appear before the Lord God.

Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven.

Neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning.

The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring unto the house of the Lord thy God.

Thou shalt not seeth a kid in his mother's milk.

27 Then the Lord said to Moses, “Write down these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 
28 Moses was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights without eating bread or drinking water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant—the Ten Commandments.","1417392714"

The idea is that you start with the original trilogy's storyline, get introduced to the characters of Luke/Leia/Vader in ep4, then see some character development in ep5, get taken to a [""flashback"" (spoilers)] (#s ""which covers the events of Anakin becoming Vader and the introduction of the Clone Army (which then become the Storm Troopers) and the birth of Luke/Leia"") in parts 2 and 3, which sets up the crescendo of ep6 and the ""coming together"" of all the previous loose ends (well, most of them...)

The reason ep1 is left out altogether is because none of the events that unfold have any bearing on the storyline of the other 5 films (should you watch them in this ""machete"" order) and it was generally regarded as the ""worst"" of the 3 secondary-trilogy movies (unless you were really in to pod racing).

I would give her some time. It's not about you, it's more that everytime someone else gets a little closer to their dreams in life, she has to confront her own life. I know it's not fair to you, but she's human and probably trying to process it. 

Obviously, I think if she really wants a baby she should leave her bf and find someone who wants the same. That's probably where the distance comes from. She may be the type of person who retreats inside themselves to resolve conflict instead of talking about it. ","1417392725"

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","&gt; あしたは日本語のクラスがありません。

は serves many roles. It replaces が in a contrastive construction (英語が話せますが、日本語は少し話せます), for instance. In the example you gave, は merely adds emphasis. It is similar to the contrastive property I listed. You are singling out 'tomorrow' contextually to emphasize the action takes place on it and not 'today' or 'the day after tomorrow'. 

By the way, you do not need to use に with あした here since it's what you can call 'relative time'. If no emphasis are added, the sentence will be "" あした、日本語…"". It's used in the sentence before that because 火曜日 (specific time) has to take に with all verbs (ある and otherwise).

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","I'm tired of people not getting this.

In person, I am a pretty valuable male. My last girlfriend was beautiful. On OkCupid, I can't pull SHIT that isn't disfigured, transsexual, or ugly... and as for the ugly part and all things considered, I have really low standards these days (because I'm trying to amass plates)...but bitches that are not even in my LEAGUE (no body, busted faces, I mean these are like 2/10 girls who are just absolute bottom of the barrel bitches) don't even message back. You know it's an issue when you have to look at all the pictures and carefully read the profile to make sure you're not talking to a man. Fucking annoying.

Understand especially on OkCupid, to get girls to message you, you have to either look phenomenal or have a good match rate (and even that doesn't mean shit). With a good match rate, you have to answer survey questions. Women will look at your survey questions and look for ANY reason to disqualify you. OkCupid is literally the anti-thesis of TRP.... you don't give all this information about yourself to bitches... it'll almost never be used to your advantage.

I've sent probably oh about 500-1000 messages on OkCupid, and I've swiped thousands of girls on Tinder. Again, I'm a pretty good looking guy, but I've really only gotten 1 number from a chick with no body who was pretty mean to me in messages. An absolute shit-show. All the girls I've talked to on Tinder were clearly just fishing for interesting conversation (aka ""**If you're going to just say hi, don't even BOTHER**), or looking for a confidence boost (a comedian has done a bit on this).

I have literally spit very very good game to some of these girls even when I get them in a conversation, making them laugh, putting them through a range of emotions... and still no go, even with strong closes. For me, I'd get much better attention in pretty much any bar, and get better looking (or agreeable women) while doing it. An ABSOLUTE... WASTE.... OF....TIME..","1417392726"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","IMO Chen and Ench, I sent email to IceFrog with some suggestions.

Problem with Ench//Chen that junlge creeps are really slow, as soon as players buys boots, creeps can't catch him and then even when Chen gets boots he needs to wait his creeps over and over again because they are slow.

So one of suggestion is that when Ench//Chen uses spell to take creep that creep also gets +10 ms or +XX ms whatever IceFrog finds that is balanced.

Junlge creeps will still have same ms so this will not screw pullings and stacks, bonus ms will come only when Ench//Chen uses their spell for controling creep, this would help to their early game, and if they have more impact in early and mid game then they will still be good and in late game.

Other suggestion was reworking golem camp and make them like  Hellbear camp and Cent camp, make 1 big and stronger Mud Golem that will have medium-range disable spell (it could be 300 range stun by throwing rock on hero head and it uses all his mana so he can only cast it once) and other small Mud golem without any spell.

Because after 6.82 Holy Persuasion is no longer restricted from targeting Spell Immune neutral creeps (Mud Golem camp), same could be aplied to Ench spell and then by doing this Ench and Chen will finaly have 2 neutrals with range disable spell, Troll and big Mud Golem.

Right now only neutral with range disable is Troll and that is not enough, I think that my 2nd suggestion is cool idea and it should be considered, it would be good and deserved buff to Ench and Chen.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","what i feel is that IV needs to be redone; its a great skill but sometimes it doesnt do the job

i think it should be redone into a skill kind of like purifying flames

a no target skill that instantly removes a large fraction of his health and armor for damage, armor regen (a la Weave) and increased regen to reheal him more than he originally had, and the buff stacks a la PF

so he would cast it, the ability would take 30% of his current hp, in return for regening 20% of his total hp over a period of time. it would also remove 30% of his current armor for 20% more armor than he ever had (a la Weave). as well, damage would also increase over time (maybe based on a percent of his hp missing). the damage, armor and regen buff would be removed once the buff is over

this is essentially trading IV's team capabilities for a more severe skill that buffs his damage dealing potential. he always has been like viper in which he can trade hits, but he always has to drain his own life a little first. this new skill makes huskar slightly weaker at the start of the fight, but he will gain full strength and more as the fight drags on

"GraphicDesign","t5_2qrct","I wouldn't sign that either. But here's the thing about contracts: they can be negotiated. I would come back with suggestions for alternate terms, or clauses being stricken, and refuse to sign until I was comfortable with the terms. The standard procedure is to strike clauses and date and initial each strike or change.

A reasonable person will accommodate reasonable changes to a contract. It sometimes requires back and forth, but that's negotiation. If they refuse to make any changes at all to a contract then I that is a signal to me not to continue doing business with them. The especially toxic techniques I've encountered are ""this is a standard contract, we don't change it"", and ""don't worry, we never actually do anything about this."" Those are both bullshit: contracts can be altered, and one should never sign a contract one doesn't agree with. 

The geographical limit, and the broadness of the non-compete clauses are of specific concern to me. Most non-compete agreements I've seen are very specific about not stealing existing clients.

"loremasters","t5_2wwy5","I hate to toot my own horn but I am a DM/livestream 4 groups all set in the same homebrew/open world.  There are set NPC's throughout the world and some NPC's have interacted with multiple groups.  The sheer number of groups moving at different paces has lead me to build a calendar where place important events on a timeline so I don't reference something that hasn't happened yet.  

As far as interacting with each other I limit it highly BUT I do have soft interaction between the groups (as opposed to hard interaction).  For example 2 groups were in the same city assault, albeit on opposite sides and with opposite stories.  The same NPCs were in the fight and interacted and one group, who's session was two days later, heard about what things that the first group did as they occurred.  

Overall it is VERY tricky to keep everything in track and as I spend so much of my life in my own make believe world I have upwards of 30,000 words of lore/plot written to keep me on track.  My proudest achievement is my appendix which boasts over 300 named NPCs with some lineages, basic descriptions and achievements.  

So...long story short, if you're looking to do multiple groups I have attempted to tackle this and I find it extremely satisfying to see my own world interact with different groups and I get to watch the world evolve first hand.  ","1417392730"

Answer: Cosplay enthusiasts and the anime section of Barnes and Noble are both excellent places to find hurtful stereotypes. 

Most of them have never seen a female and/or homosexual before however this is great news because they will have little or no baseline for comparison once you start talking to them! 

Even if they are not necessarily marriage material(their food stockpiles are limited to Kraft Macaroni &amp; Cheese, Ramen noodles, Doritos, and Mountain Dew); you can likely sell their World Of Warcraft accounts for a reasonable supply of .22lr ammo and a bolt action rifle at your local gun show.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","No worries. The USSR technically dissolved in '91, but that was a result of many factors that had been brewing for many years; economic crashes don't just happen overnight. 

Anyways, the US had been sending ""military advisers"" to Vietnam as early as the late 1950s, but for clarity's sake, I'm going to assume a time placement of 1964, right after the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution was signed and the US really started to openly ramp things up. 

Since the US and Russia are on separate continents, the key factor in any global conflict is going to be their navies. Without ships, you can't move troops across oceans. It's that simple. And while Russia's ground forces were arguably on par with the US during this time period, and certainly held the numerical advantage, the Soviets were never able to match the USN. They built up a significant submarine fleet, true, but you can't move many troops or much equipment in a submarine. 

So ultimately, I doubt either country would be able to touch the other's homeland. Russia can't get to the US because the USN would blow any significant troop movement out of the water, and the US doesn't want to invade Russia because duh, it's f**king Russia. 

So, with that in mind: 

US strategy: starve the beast. Use your navy to cut off Russia from the outside world, and put enough pressure on the European/ Mideast fronts to tie up their ground forces in a defensive conflict. Then call on your wealthy Western European allies for reinforcements/more trade sanctions, cripple the Soviet economy, and wait for the Russian people to sue for peace.

Soviet strategy: go for the oil. You can't compete on the water, and you don't have the economic strength to slug it out over many years, so you need to hit the US/the West where it hurts. Throw as much of your forces as you can spare at the Middle East, moving down through the Caucuses and Eastern Bloc states, and try to capture and hold the significant oil fields. Without fuel, the American war machine grinds to a halt, and their vaunted navy can't venture out of their ports. Gas shortages wrack the Western economies, and they give up. 

Alternatively, take London, Berlin and/or Paris. Capturing the capitols of the US' major European allies should take them out of the fight, deny the US access to their bases, and provide powerful bargaining chips to force a truce/surrender. London would be difficult to take due to the English Channel and the Royal Navy standing in the way of a ground invasion, but could be bombed into submission if the mainland was controlled. The best bet would be to go for Paris. 

Most likely scenario: Russia goes for the Mideast, and is initially successful due to the element of surprise, but gets bogged down by local resistance/harried by air attacks from Mediterranean-based US carriers. US/allies push back up from Egypt, out from Israel; stalemate forms in/around Iraq and Syria. 

In the west, Russia captures the rest of Berlin almost instantly. West German forces withdraw to the French border and form a defensive line with the help of French, British, and American forces. Stalemate on the Western front. 

Meanwhile, the US and Royal Navies tighten the noose in the Pacific and the North Sea. Russian submarines exact some toll on Allied cargo, but the sea war is still skewed decisively in America's favor. Denied both their lucrative oil exports and most imports, the Russian home front is crippled. Faced with a starving, riotous populace at home and an impossible stalemate abroad, Russia eventually withdraws after European go-betweens broker some way for them to save face. 

So, all in all, I would say US 6.5/10, maybe 7/10. If Russia can conquer Europe before the US can effectively react, and/or seize control of the Mideast, they would be in a very powerful bargaining position. That said, if anything goes wrong, and the war drags on, Russia simply doesn't have the economic strength or global allies to go toe-to-toe with the US for very long, nor the naval forces to seriously threaten the American homeland.

"slp","t5_2sjju","I have worked in several school districts (not in WA, though), and I haven't heard of evaluation-only positions unless a) you're bilingual and doing the evaluations in the minority language or b) you're on an early intervention/preschool diagnostics team. It may be worth combing the job descriptions on different school districts' websites near your area or contacting contract companies to see if they have anything available that fits what you want. Where did you read about the evaluation-only positions? Was anyone named in the article that you could contact?

Unfortunately, I can't imagine that doing only evaluations completely eliminates scheduling issues, drama among the teachers, or behavior management issues. There's parent-drama, too, if you deliver unexpected results, and administrator pressure to make sure costs stay low. Just a tip from a full-time school SLP. ;-)

I'm not sure what the laws are in Washington, but you may be able to provide services to parochial students through a public school system. In my experience, parochial schools are just glad to have someone there to provide services and can be much more flexible with scheduling.

Have you considered working in an outpatient clinic? That would certainly reduce scheduling issues and teacher drama, although behavior management is always going to be on your plate as long as you plan on working with humans. :-)

Best of luck in your search. Let us know if you turn up anything!

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","We use equations that rely on the speed of light being a universal constant maximum speed all the time. If it wasn't a universal constant, if gravity or anything else could break the limit, the things we use the equations for would not work. GPS being the prime example. 

Time dilation for example, part of relativity, isn't just an Einstein thought experiment. It's a real thing, a thing we can measure, and a thing that's important to account for in anything involving space. We have to specifically engineer GPS satellites to account for relativity, because time passes differently in high orbits where those satellites are.

All of the equations and fundamental principles that underpin the design of sucb systems rely on the speed of light being a universal constant maximum. If it wasn't, they wouldn't work. They do work, so it clearly is.

You're asking for very complicated concepts to be explained simply and they just can't be simplified past a certain point. If you still don't understand, you're going to need to educate yourself further.

So hours of searching go by. I can't find any of my 3 sets, including the one I keep in the drawer next to the door. I call the lock smith to let me out of my own house. 

I did find the 1 set of keys later that night. My main set was in the dishwasher. Pretty sure I set them on the counter, they got knocked on to the door of the dishwasher by my asshole cat, I closed it and started. The second set found 1 week later is on my bathroom towel hook. I put them there then hung a towel. The third set is still yet to be found.","1417392739"

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Because there are already tons of props in the game for people to use, and no real variety between them - during wars, you are more likely to see new variants of existing aircraft than new aircraft altogether unless something just doesn't work. The Spitfire for example was one of the best models of prop aircraft ever developed, hence why the Brits have about 50,000 variants of the Spitfire. The jets on the other hand were developed mostly during less intense wars, meaning that defense initiatives could focus more on variety than consistency. And even then there weren't that many different models of jets. More variety in top tier is always nice.

And you're example with the F-86 F2 doesn't really work. That is literally one of the top three jets in the game. Of course it is going to have a huge grind. Same with the Meteor F.8. On the other hand, the Venom is also a high-tier jet that you only need to get through one jet to obtain. Now granted this jet is the Vampire which is horrible unless you know how to use it properly, but it's still much less of a grind.","1417392739"

It was cold, wet and windy, and felt like some great hand had just grabbed onto my belt and yanked me up, about 5 seconds after that I came out of the bottom of the cloud and saw the countryside stretch away with rolling hills of greens and browns.

Number two was on a camping trip with my best mates about six months ago, we were just chilling on a riverbend a little after sunset with a few brews and passing a joint around under the stars. It was peaceful, I'd talk about serenity, but there wasn't any powerlines around.

Number 3 isn't really a moment, but it's the same feeling when I get off my train, or boat, or bus or plane and take my first steps into a new place. Doesn't matter if the weather is total crap, I'm lost or broke, I'm always happy to be seeing new things.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","You know what, I've been thinking about it.  I have been having this discussion with you and a similar one with another poster at the same time.  I was thinking what has me so against taking Mariota.  Honestly?  I think it is a few things.  One is just being gun shy taking a QB in the first round because of the Bucs past history of first round QB busts.  Another part is just to defend the opposing view point.  I have seen too many fans, Bucs fans included, think that QB is the savior of a team and that the Bucs will become winners if the Bucs take a QB high, no matter who that QB is.  Especially those who screamed to take Tebow and Manziel.  Those people just seemed to be jumping on the cool new hot college QB and I was getting that vibe with a lot of Mariota supporters.



With all that said, and actually thinking about the situation, I am not as vehemently opposed to taking Mariota as I was and come off as.  Primarily because you brought up a great point, that he is not a diva and a hard worker.  He clearly has some talent.  If he works hard and keeps his head about him, he can develop into a solid QB.  


How is he as far as leadership?  I hear he is a super nice guy and quiet.  I haven't paid that kind of attention to him to notice details on whether he has it in him to grab an o-lineman's facemask and call them out in the heat of the game.  How does he handle adversity in a game?  How does he handle coming out the next week after a loss?  Will he earn and keep the respect of his teammates through winning and losing?



Fans like you and others are starting to win me over.

In his 5 years with the Kitchener Rangers he took them to the playoffs every year (showing drastic improvement to before he was hired) and winning the Memorial Cup. 

Florida was a terrible team and its hard to blame the coach alone when the management itself was terrible.

I don't think Pete is a great coach, but I think he is way better than average. If we fire Pete, who do we choose? I can't think of a realistic coaching possibility that would be an improvement with the team we have.","1417392744"

For help with a new PC build, submit a post in /r/buildapc, to look for sales on parts, check out /r/buildapcsales, and if you have an idea of what you want, but not sure of the parts, submit a post at /r/buildapcforme. Since you have your parts thought out, i recommend you make a [Build Ready] post on /r/buildapc. ALSO, if you have any general questions, /r/buildapc has an IRC channel, but i can't link it as i am in my phone.

My personal suggestions for your build: the PSU should have about 30% more wattage than pcpartpicker reccomends because your system will use a lot more power under full load, and you do NOT want to run short on wattage.

Make sure your case has clearance for all of your parts, including the video card. I recommend a good half inch of extra video card space for extra wiggle room/future expansion.

Go with a FULLY MODULAR Power supply, you will not regret it.","1417392745"

It was definitely tongue in cheek.   It was a reference to the way sexist people start rationalizing women kicking ass in chemistry when you put enough irrefutable evidence in front of them to get them to admit that women are :

A:  Good at it.

B:  Taking over the field through sheer numbers.

It is also an example of pink washing in action.  The moment you get someone to acknowledge that women are good at a previously male dominated career track they immediately *start belittling the field*.  Well of course women are good at it!  It's *just cooking*!  Easy!  Can't be that hard if women are good at it.

Also why we shouldn't pay it much.  Its not that hard.    


Also, [MIT thinks cooking is chemistry](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/special-programs/sp-287-kitchen-chemistry-spring-2009/):

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

I would highly recommend getting Paragon as well, if you can, because it makes the Limit Breaker grinding tolerable. As someone who has spent 100 hours grinding without DLC, do yourself the favor xD. Here are the pairings I have planned out...not too many, but some.


-----------------------------------


**Chrom x Sumia**


*Chrom – Support Paladin*


Lord&gt;Great Lord&gt;Great Knight&gt;Paladin


Charm

Dual Strike+

Duel Guard+

Defender

Limit Break


*Sumia – Lead General*


Dark Flier&gt;War Cleric&gt;Great Knight&gt;General


Luna

Galeforce/Renewal/Lancefaire (Pick one)

Aegis

Pavise

Limit Break


-----------------------------------


**Frederick x Panne**


*Frederick – Physical Lead*


Luna

Aegis

Pavise

Dual Guard+

Defender/AS +2


*Panne – Wyvern Lord Support*


Pass

Deliverer

Lancebreaker

Swordbreaker

Limit Breaker


-----------------------------------


**Donnel x Sully**


*Donnel – Hero Lead*

Armsthrift

Sol

Counter

Axebreaker

Limit Breaker


*Sully – Paladin Support*


Dual Guard+

Defender

Swordfaire

Lancebreaker

Limit Breaker


-----------------------------------------


**Stahl x Miriel** (Some people ask me what a ""Switch"" is. Basically, it's a pairing in which both units are competent fighters on their own; neither is restricted to lead or support skills. They have a mix of both, making them weaker in each area. The advantage of running a switch is that if one person gets low on HP, you can simply switch and have a equally competent fighter available until help can arrive. For example, Stahl, the lead, has skills like Defender and Swordfaire, just in case he's supporting. Miriel has Lifetaker and Renewal, just in case she's leading. It's an experimental pairing, as I said :P.)


*Stahl – Assassin Lead/Switch*

Defender

Luna

Aegis

Swordfaire

Limit Breaker


*Miriel – War Cleric Boltaxe Support/Switch*


Dark Mage&gt;Troubadour&gt;Valkyrie&gt;War Cleric  


Lifetaker

Anathema

Renewal

Dual Support+

Limit Breaker


-------------------------------------------


**Yarne x Lucina**


*Yarne – Wyvern Lord Support*


Dual Guard+

Axefaire

Lucky 7

Defender

Limit Break


*Lucina - General Tank* ...you can't go wrong with a simple tank. And you certainly can't go wrong with a not-so-simple Aether/RK tank. :P

Aether

Pavise

Aegis

Rightful King

Limit Break


------------------------------


**Brady x Cynthia**


*Brady – Lead Anything Magic*


Luna

Galeforce

Tomefaire

Renewal/Dual Guard+ if Cynthia doesn't have it. [Any skill can go here, I just chose Renewal :P]

Limit Breaker


*Cynthia - Dark Flier or Sage Support:*


Aether

Galeforce

Tomefaire

Dual Guard+

Limit Break


--------------------------------------------


**Inigo x Noire**


*Inigo - Physical lead. Hero/Swordmaster/etc.*


Vantage

Sol

Galeforce

Armsthrift

Limit Break


*Noire - Assassin Galeforce Support:*


Luna/Astra

Galeforce

Bowfaire/Swordfaire

Dual Guard+

Limit Break


--------------------------------------


**Laurent x Severa**


*Severa - Hero Lead*


Luna/Sol

Axefaire

Galeforce

Lifetaker/Dual Guard+

Limit Break


*Laurent - Warrior Support* -Warriors are very underused support units. I prefer them to Berserkers, but many people will disagree. Go with what you want.


Dual Guard+

Dual Support+/All Stats+2

Bowfaire (If Warrior)

Axefaire 

Limit Break


------------------------------------------


**Morgan x Gerome**


*Gerome - Pure Physical Support (Wyvern Lord)*


Axefaire

Armsthrift

Dual Support+

Deliverer

Limit Breaker


*Morgan – Hero Tank*


Armsthrift/Galeforce (Not too useful because Gerome doesn't have it, but the extra attack can help. I prefer not to have Galeforce because I like being attacked (PavGis) instead of attacking. And Armsthrift is helpful as crap.

Ignis/Luna

Aegis

Pavise

Limit Breaker


--------------------------------


**Owain x Nah**


*Owain – Sorcerer Glass Cannon*

Vantage

Vengeance

Wrath/Miracle

Tomefaire

Limit Break 


*Nah - Manakete Tank Failsafe* (Failsafes are quite self explanatory. If Owain is about to get demolished for some reason, you can switch to the tank to save you. However, it might not be very effective because Owain is always ""almost dying"" with his skillset. So predicting the difference between ""almost dead"" and ""dead,"" and switching accordingly might be hard.)


Luna

Pavise

Renewal

Dual Guard+/All Stats+2

I have a full-size Asus 970 GPU, normal SeaSonic 550w PSU, etc. Aside from only having one PCI-e slot and two RAM slots, it really has everything I'd ever need. Anything and everything can be OC'd, and I have more than adequate cooling with a single 200mm intake and 120mm exhaust fan.

And does this mean you're saying you can be a Zen Master without students? Because the implication of the term in Chinese, is that you teach - not that ""you're enlightened""

Anyone who goes around considering themselves ""enlightened"" has already violated a key idea, that of no-self. 

If there is no self to be enlightened, whoever says they are enlightened are certainly not.


So I find that definition not only to be different than its historical purpose and use within the sect, but also potentially incorrect.

I know a homeless guy who apparently had everything in his live happen in 1953.

""hey tim, what do you think about milk?""

""nah... the best milk I ever had was in 1953.""

""Hey timmy, you going to the meal tonight?""

""Back in '53, I had a great meal.""

Shit like that.

He also blames the pentagon for everything... And by everything, I mean everything...

Apparently according to him, when he was in the army, probably in '53, he was held captive at the pentagon and had experiments done on him.

He is quite a character...

 Volunteering at a homeless shelter has its ups and downs... Ups are the great people who I get to help, and the downs, are well, knowing some people will never over come their homelessness due to serious mental issues.. According to ""Chopper Bob"", he is really smart, but only opens up to certain folks....

Not without rewriting the physics of the early universe. BAO both in the CMB and late time rules out baryon densities high enough to account for all of dark matter. This is the strongest price of evidence which say's dark matter isn't baryonic.

&gt;A recent experiment detecting the diffuse glow of dim, intergalactic stars, found enough stars, and therefore matter, to account for 2/3 of dark matter.  Other, previous studies that tried to account for dark matter as rogue planets were given up on, because they could only account for about 1/4 of dark matter.

I'll ask for your sources on these. I think you're mistaken. Stars would have shown up in micro-lensing surveys which ruled out small dense objects like low mass stars.

People are living longer and healthier lives and thus they work longer. But even though the participation rate in that group is up, more people are in that age group! Even though participation in that group is up, you still have more people retiring than ever before because that age group makes up a larger proportion of the US population than ever before. It's crazy that people don't realize this... What matters is the percentage of all Americans that are retiring. Not the percentage of older individuals that are still working. You can have a super high labor participation rate in that group and still have more people retiring than ever before.

Yes part of the story is lower participation from younger individuals, but you know why? Because young people are staying in school longer. But by far the biggest contributor to the declining labor force is a growing retired population.","1417392757"

So what I should have said is that I compiled FNIS Main and FNIS Flying Mod and when that was done compiling a created a new mod out of that called ""FNIS Flying Mod GENERATED"". Now I click to activate all three in the left-hand 'mod' window but the only esp file that shows up in my plugins list is from the original FNIS Flying Mod that I downloaded from Nexus.  
  
EDIT: I played around with the two test mods, FNIS Sexy Movement and FNIS Pretty Motion Package, and it looks like I got those to work. I compiled both of them with FNIS main into one mod, ""FNIS Sexy Movement + Pretty Motion GENERATED"", and I activated the FNIS Main, the two FNIS mods, and the Generated Mod, and they both worked without much problem (I noticed when I quit to desktop it took a long time to actually quit the program). So I'm going to play around with the flying one some more.  
  
EDIT 2: I got it to work! I compiled again and activated all three in the left ""mod"" list, started up the game and before I knew it I was flying! Only problem is now I need to find out how to make it configurable, that spell eats through stamina like no spell I've ever seen.

"melbourne","t5_2qkhb","Hi! I graduated from marketing at RMIT in 2006 as a mature age student. I'd say you're in the perfect position, having retail experience means you can probably fit a couple of jobs around study, that's what I did.

The subjects I struggled with were the ones like statistics and accounting, where having that foundation out of high school, like the rest of my class would have really helped.

To compound the problem you're studying with a bunch of kids with newly discovered freedom so forget concentrating in those first year subjects (because the kids will pass by showing up, honestly first year uni subjects are frequently a distilled version of a high school concept) where you really need to and the kids understand it. Subjects you struggle with and the kids don't, means lots of extra hours studying in the library for you. 

I built my life around the city campus of RMIT, I got a job across the road at a franchise with stores across the city and would pop in every morning to let my manager know I'd be available for shifts anywhere in the CBD after class. I'd normally pick up 4 or 5 shifts a week doing this. Sometimes I'd go to Uni, grab a coffee, have a class, work for 5 hours, do another class, work till 1am and then catch the last tram home. I was studying 20 hrs working 45+ in the holidays I'd just work my arse off and take home $1200 - $1500 a week to support the study periods where my availability dropped. 

Be fit, be super fit. Your brain will work better and you'll have the energy to live a double life. 

Make downtime study time, uptime is either at uni or at work. 

In my final semester I was a Volunteer for the Commonwealth Games, Studied an 8 subject load and worked 40 hours per week casually. I graduated with excellent marks and had enough money to go to Europe for 3 and a half months on a better than average budget. ","1417392759"

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","They come in all sizes, though (at least in my experience) larger ones (4U) are more typical.  From the perspective of the people for whom this gear is designed, if you needed fewer drives, it would be simpler to just directly attach them to your server(s), wouldn't it?

There is nothing *special* about a JBOD chassis; something sold as a ""JBOD chassis"" is just a pre-assembled set of the right parts.  You need the chassis, which can be anything; you need a power supply; and you need some way to communicate with the drives.  Many storage chassis models (which can be used to build JBODs or to build servers) will include backplanes that have SAS expanders on them.  (With Supermicro, for example, any chassis whose model ends in `-E16` or `-E26` has single or redundant 6Gbps SAS2 expanders on its backplanes.  You plug a single four-lane mini-SAS cable into each backplane.)

The one slightly special piece of hardware you might want is a power relay board.  (You can buy Supermicro's for about $30 as a spare part, if you need one.)  This just watches the main chassis' power and turns the JBOD chassis' power supply on and off as appropriate.

Four-lane mini-SAS ports are common, but don't necessarily mean that you are limited to four drives.  This is what you would plug into a SAS expander; the downstream drives would share the four upstream lanes back to the SAS controller (HCA) in the server.  (Check the total number of drives that your SAS chipset supports before trying this.  If it's a normal LSI part, you are almost certainly fine.)

If you have a non-rackmount case and just want to add four drives, then I would suggest getting a [drive cage](http://www.moddiy.com/products/5%252din%252d3-Device-Module-Hard-Disk-Cage-SAS%7B47%7DSATA-Expander-Enclosure.html), a mini-SAS breakout cable, and a SATA/SAS power splitter.  You can either install that thing in your non-rackmount case, if you have the three 5-1/4"" bays to spare, or sit it on top like you were asking about.  (Remember to grab a 120mm case fan and appropriate power cabling if your drive cage doesn't come with one.)  This saves you the second power supply and the power relay, though it obviously doesn't scale.

That said, there *are* consumer equivalents, but most of them will wind up wasting your time.  SATA port multipliers, in particular, have all sorts of performance and stability quirks.  They are *not* generally supported by SAS adapters (with the exception that certain Marvell SAS controllers support certain Marvell SATA port multipliers).  The one that I wasted a bunch of time on is the [RSV-S8](http://www.rosewill.com/products/1189/ProductDetail_Overview.htm), which is basically a little box that has two four-port SATA port multipliers (SiI3826) and a tiny power supply in it.  Good luck, if you go that route.

All of these solutions fall under the umbrella of ""direct-attached storage"" (DAS, versus ""network-attached storage"", or NAS), in case Googling that helps you.","1417392761"

Ellie's sacrifice would be tainted in Joel's eyes since it wouldn't make anything better

Ellie in the game is the embodiment of hope that Marlene and Joel fight to gain control of in the game. Marlene's hope is to find a cure from Ellie's body, even if it kills her in the process and for Joel it's that he can be forgiven for not being able to save Sarah and regain what he lost in Sarah, which was his hope, his reason to live. Marlene stands to threaten that which forces Joel to kill her out of selfish desires. Tommy found his hope in the building of his community and Joel finds his in Ellie which brings him full circle to where he was at the beginning of the game and he regains his hope and his reason to survive.

People always seem to think steep top tube angle = an aggressive ""track"" geo. Out of the frames you listed, the vigorelli has one of the more track oriented geometries. It will be better suited to the track because of its steep head tube and seat tube angles. The histogram has a really relaxed head tube angle (to eliminate pedal strike for ROAD riding) and is not too suited for the track. Dosnoventa is probably the most egregious offender of aggressive looking but relaxed frames for this reason. Out of the cinellis, the parallax and vigo are the most track oriented. The langster pro and omnium are probably more suited to the track than the parallax, even, as they were designed to be track bikes, not fixed gear frames for road riding/crits. ","1417392762"

A base int buff of 4 or so would be far more beneficial than a 0.4 per level increase for example. 

The reason I suggested buffing his abilities' mana/cooldown if because they're incredibly terrible compared to other supports. 1.5 second stun and 70 magic damage at level 2 for 270 mana is a joke. Extra stats would help but hs spells would still be terrible when it comes to efficiency. My other suggestion was a speed buff because then he could better make use of the one good thing about his non-ultimate spells, the cast time. With something like 310 move speed he could be very proficient at catching people off guard with Telekinesis and also be less susceptible to just being blown up early on. ","1417392764"

There's very little you can read into the behaviour of others imo because it's too subjective.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Any Rammstein music video is mesmerizing to watch. And I mean *any* of them. I haven't seen a single bad Rammstein music video.

Metallica's videos have always been well done. Mostly because they have the money to do them well.

Van Halen's early 80s videos like ""hot for teacher"" are really comical. The video for ""hot for teacher"" was also banned from MTV. It caused a big uproar when it was released because people said it ""sexually objectified teachers."" (Which is awesome.) 

My personal favourite though is ""let forever be"" by The Chemical brothers. It's like watching an M.C. Escher painting come to life, watch it once and you'll be like, ""how the hell did they film that?!"" 

Literally ALL of Eminem's music videos are well done too.

He won't get VAC banned or anything else, and his every day life will continue.

He visited me for a day and a half, which sucks. Afterwards, I got that post-seeing your s/o depression. It sucks but if you guys plan out the next visit, it just makes you more motivated to do more and get going. 

Yes, we are still in our long distance relationship. 9 months on 12/11! Well, he plans on moving here within a year to a year and a half, with occasional visits every 2-3 months. It honestly makes the waiting a lot easier. 

He visited me again in November for 3 days and it felt as if he never left. It's an amazing feeling. Whenever we're down about the distance, we always remind one another about the upcoming visit, and we're happy again. ","1417392768"

"cinematography","t5_2ri38","I second /u/2old2care's sentiments about dslr's for live work, but not ""auto everything''. Auto won't work with multiple cameras shooting different angles. Unless the light is insanely even... like true 1:1 (which almost never happens), including background and foreground, then it doesn't work. Variations in shadows, set piece colors, and skin tones will throw off  exposure and color settings. Auto focus is a terrible idea unless things are constantly in motion, and even then studio productions have people pulling focus remotely. Too many things can throw off and fool the AF for you to trust it. I don't care how fancy the face tracking is, it's not a substitute for the human eye.

A better idea is to pre-light the set with stand ins, then use a meter to figure out your ratios and a consistent exposure to keep all the cameras at. For depth of field and sharpness reasons, you probably want to expose your cameras at f5.6-f8, and their native ISO/gain. As long as each camera is the exact same, same exposures, same color balances, then you shouldn't have any inconsistencies.  

You also want to make sure that the lenses being used are either all the same, or are from the same set.

As far as cameras, it depends on how you want to edit the show, and what the workflow will be. If you don't care to monitor each camera during shooting, and aren't doing a live edit with a tricaster or something,  then a GH or a BMPCC would do fine. However, if you want to monitor everything from a booth during shooting, then you need to use cameras with an SDI out. HDMI is flimsy and prone to breaking, especially the micro hdmi on the pocket cam. 

So I'd recommend the full sized BM Cinema camera, BM Production camera, sony F3, Canon c300, etc. All of which have SDI out's. If you get a canon mount camera, then zooms are very affordable to rent. The 24-105 F4 L is pretty great. Your cheapest camera options will be the black magics, but if you trust your operators and don't mind not being able to monitor, then smaller and cheaper cameras will suffice.","1417392770"

When I decided to get one, I spent a weekend looking them up and reviews, and then made my purchase. I have been using it for a couple of years and have been very happy with it. But I have had zero reason to need more of a community to it all. I bought the keyboard, I use the keyboard. I enjoy using the keyboard. Do I need to talk about it and join communities?

I have no idea why things are the way they are, it just sucks. Rescuing the Yazidis WAS an amazing move and fully justified, I concur.

Hitler moved to declare war on America within two days (that timing may be wrong, but it was almost IMMEDIATELY after Pearl Harbor) of the Japanese sneak attack, but the ENTIRE high command absolutely and ultimately wanted to sever ties with Japan as a result, most going so far as to claim the war was doomed (not in the Fuhrer's presence, of course) because they knew America would have been better as a neutral trade entity. Hitler claimed it was to carry on their non-aggression pact with Japan and to act as good allies, and ultimately tried to reason that America was going to get involved anyway so it was really necessary, honestly guys, really, it just HAD to happen, promise. Sidenote: he sincerely sucked at rationalizing his actions, and this one almost led to a coup d'état and was part of the reasoning behind initiating Operation Valkyrie. And yeah you're right on that note, Germany absolutely was threatening countries we were allies with but the populous at large did not want to be involved in a war until it was made personal, something Japan decided to ignore without even warning Hitler of their intent (he learned America was attacked the same time we ourselves did). 

Involvement in the middle east has been a clusterfuck ever since the end of WWII, ironically enough considering the sidetrack the convo took. It's an issue that won't go away without a lot more pain, I feel, and that's really sad. ","1417392771"
"science","t5_mouw","Lots of folks commenting here are saying they had trouble getting diagnosed, even when they themselves suspected Lyme disease.

Why not just prescribe antibiotics on suspicion alone? Antibiotics are prescribed on suspicion for much less serious stuff - strepp throat, sinus infection, etc. Over-prescription of antibiotics is rampant, so wouldn't the additional instances from Lyme suspicion be a drop in the bucket? Seems to me like an extremely serious disease is a good candidate for where you *should* adopt a better-safe-than-sorry approach, unlike when your GP gives you antibiotics for a sore throat or runny nose... Is there a reason why this over-prescription phenomenon does not spill over to Lyme disease? Are the antibiotics used different from those that are typically over-prescribed? Are the courses of treatment different/longer?","1417392771"

In the brain, the areas that govern the feet and the genitalia are in adjacent areas of the somatosensory cortex.

Well, some people can derive sexual arousal, or pleasure through stimulation of the feet.

Seems like, since public teachers are public employees, they've been tarred with the ""inefficient government, sucking off the public teat"" brush. Teaching used to be a respected profession, but now teachers are so underpaid and overworked that anyone who can, gets a private sector job that pays more. That leaves the bottom of the barrel teaching in public schools, especially in urban districts that don't have the money coming in that suburban upscale districts do.

It also has to do with the fact that all of the interest these days is in standardized test prep, so students are no longer being taught critical thinking *how to think* skills, but instead are being taught ""to the test"" which leaves out a lot.","1417392772"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt;Education Minister Christopher Pyne has also conceded to crossbench demands on his higher education changes, retaining the student interest rate at the consumer price index instead of lifting it to the higher bond rate.

&gt;The Government has also agreed to a proposal from Victorian senator John Madigan to give students who are new parents a five-year interest rate pause.

This indicates the *opposite* of ditching its university overhaul. Compromises suggest that the core element of deregulation is being passed. They're hardly looking for compromises if they're backing down. Something like deregulation can't be effectively undone.

Incidentally, that new parent thing is a fucking rubbish suggestion. It's punishing people who choose not to have kids, or do the responsible thing by finishing their education first. I'm so glad to know that I and all of my childless friends at uni are having the tertiary system sold out from underneath us but people who choose to have kids at 20 get a break. Even with all that, declining parenthood as education qualifications rise means that this will be a minor benefit for a major disadvantage. Get fucked Madigan.","1417392775"

And if illegals were not in the US to begin with, the could not have committed these murders... and that's not to mention all the other criminal activity outside of homicide!

And to suggest that legal immigrants increase welfare, so illegal immigrants should be allowed to increase welfare as well, is ludicrous on its face.  The US owes no special benefit to them as non-citizens.  

Additionally, I still have not seen the numbers concluding that this economic gain you state Illegals bring to the US,  completely offsets the financial burden they impose.","1417392775"

At 3:45 your mono sawy synth goes down a semitone I think and it sounds ugly. Overall you have a 'W' mix, where things are either extremely stereo or mono.

Secondly, Flusha could've easily proven his innocence at Dreamhack. I'm a person who likes to believe people are innocent unless proven so, and I feel a huge weight of suspicion would've been lifted from me and many people who think like me if he had done so.

Finally if Fnatic really disband or any of the players leave because of any of this I will personally have no sympathy towards them. These players are mentally really strong to be able to play professionally, and if this gets to them then I feel either they aren't fit for esports or (hopefully not) the accusations are true. Either way their lack of sportsmanship on this tournament really made the whole esports scene hit a new low after the bans from a couple weeks ago

That is also the date that they send them back, but if they kept the date on the cover as November then it would be hard for a stand to realize when Dec. came around then they should take all the Nov. ones off the shelf and to take them back. So makes sense to put the pull date; instead of the release date on the magazines/comics because if someone stopped in Jan. and saw Nov. on the cover then they are less likely to buy a magazine/comic that is 2 months out of date. So they stuck the pull date on the cover and customers think it is new even when it isn't and more likely to buy it.

They have sockpuppet accounts on youtube that write ""[As a black Oath Keeper...](https://reddit.com/r/asablackman)"" comments on videos criticizing them.

Check out some of their local rallies on youtube. If a speaker doesn't talk about the world being rapidly overtaken by some big bad evil, you win a hat. You have to make it yourself though.

They're pretty typical of an ultranationalist group - paranoid and itching for conflict.

 Does the use of deadly force on a black person justify a rallying call to threaten more black people with deadly force? Of course it does!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This dude is right. 

In terms of financial regulation it is going to be fairly irrelevant once we see the planned role out of Basel III by 2019. I'm not sure I necessarily agree with Basel, but the common equity and capital conservation requirements being inflexible but I think the counter cyclical buffer fixed at 2.5% could lead to some interesting national variations. 

Anyway, as for European and US financial regulations, they're fairly similar and let's face it, Dodd Frank and our European equivalent are bloody similar. Particularly when it comes to measures to mitigating against the  'too big to fair' mentality we adopted prior to 2007. We also have both taken very similar measures to avoid the moral hazard of mortgage securitisation and deposit insurance. 

If we (London) ever were less regulated then we certainly won't be in the future. This chap above me will tell you better than I ever could, the whole point of our recent banking reforms has been to make the global regulatory system more homogenised. ","1417392782"

"hoggit","t5_2tifv","I do not own the steam version of DCS World, but I've found this FAQ on the ED forums that might help you out: http://forums.eagle.ru/showthread.php?t=113587

&gt;**I have added my key to Steam but the module does not appear in the game**

&gt;After entering the key of your newly purchased product, Steam will update DCS World. Make sure the game is not active and let the update finish before re-entering the game.

I myself have not played around with CA very much, but I have had people in multi-player use the ground units to act as a human JTAC which is pretty cool. I cannot help much more than this, sorry. Hopefully someone else that runs DCS through steam can help you out here, good luck!

"GTAV","t5_2rjys","Sell cars to the spray shop whenever you can but don't sell anything for less than $6000 as you can only sell a car every 45 minutes I think so to sell for anything less is a waste. I tend to look for Ubermacht models or Gallivanter Ballers both old and new as they are pretty common and go for around $9000. Also sell cars to Simeon when it's available. If you are seriously wanting to save money then I suggest doing all of this in an invite only game as mingling with other players will eventually cost you money one way or another.

I also found banning myself from making frivolous purchases helped a lot if I was saving for something. It's easy to spend $10k on a few items of clothing or something without realising it, or spending $20k on your car. I ended up only allowing myself to buy ammo for the guns I actually used and I noticed a big difference in the money I was saving.

Generally doing a mix of missions and playlists in between selling cars seems to be the best way to get money. Personally I like survivals. You get $30k if your teams good enough to survive wave 10, although on average I'd say most teams get to around 7 or 8 where you get around $10k. They can last a while if your team goes the distance and can fill up the time between selling cars nicely.","1417392783"

"WoodenPotatoes","t5_34l7g","It finally happened.

I've really ""discovered"" WP just maybe... 2 weeks ago? But you've probably seen me participating in a lot of discussions, and leaving quite a few comments. That was partially fueled by the observation that WP seemed to share my opinion in every single aspect, on nearly every single topic. At first I was amazed... then slowly terrified by this observation. Had I become some weird fanboy, worshipping each word that was spoken by the great prophet and spiritual leader that is WoodenPotatoes?

And today, it happened. WP said about one of the best movies ever made by mankind, Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, that he didn't like it. HE DIDN'T LIKE IT.

And that means: I'm not a fanboy. I've got my own opinion. Maybe I'm not even insane. But the most important part: Wooden Potatoes, you've got a very bad taste for movies.","1417392787"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;We're discussing a country with a highly active gun culture

Where most people will claim that a big majority if not all gun owners know what they are doing and the police shouldn't fear them. If that's true, my statement still stands. If your statement is true, than something has to be done with gun control.

&gt;Oh sure, they wont fight the cops as much. How about committing the crimes in the first place?

Well having good education and social welfare will help to prevent crime. Also would rather have that mobs go riot after a cop emptied a full clip in some desperate young adult or that that same young adult is locked away for a fair time?

&gt; 'Hey, come look, prison is fantastic' is exactly what you want to be telling a bunch of homeless people who are struggling to survive

I have yet to meet a dutch cop who says that's a big problem. Only heard tales of homeless people coming into the police station at night cursing the attendant there, so he/she could sleep one night on a metal bench in the cells in the station because it was too cold outside.  
It's cheaper here to give a homeless person a one room in permanent shelter than putting them in prison. 

In the end, if something is done the wrong way doesn't mean it isn't realistic. That's like saying you can't build a comfy car at all if one guy made the wheels look like squares instead of rounds.","1417392787"

"HIMYM","t5_2rcqy","I just finished it last night and loved it. I actually like the ending more the more I think about it. I already posted my thoughts elsewhere, so I'll just echo it here:

To be honest, the only thing I've ever disliked in the show was the back and forth between Ted and Robin in the later seasons. It felt redundant and at times painful. After seeing the ending, now I know why they stretched it out as much as they did. So it alleviates my one complaint about the show.

As for everything else that happens in the finale, they accomplished what they were trying to do. It was painful that Barney and Robin divorced, and when the group gradually grew apart, and when Tracy died.

It probably affected my view of the ending that I had a detail spoiled for me -- I knew someone would die. I had a good idea it was the mother, and since they hinted at it a few episodes beforehand in the episode with Ted and her at the restaurant, I pretty much knew for a fact before the finale. I don't know how I would have felt if this was a surprise for me, but my brother didn't know and enjoyed it (I asked him at the time and he said ""ended how it should have), and I probably still would have too.

I would have liked a predictable happy-ever-after ending, but I knew that wasn't what was coming. What it was was tense and emotional, and I appreciated it for that. I don't see it as this massive ""fuck you"" everyone else thinks it is.","1417392788"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Just saying, Fizz is slightly op atm, and he could use some nerfs, but not alot. He gets countered rly hard by diana, mordekaiser, riven, and etc. Most people find these Melee Assassins OP, (Ex: riven, talon, fizz, zed, rengar, akali, etc.) but, you should know. They're MELEE ASSASSINS. Which means that they're best at melee 1v1s and has the best burst in games. You shouldn't ever try to fight them 1v1, or stay in lane behind towers if you're low. That's what they're good at. They however, usually have bad laning phase (at least early), and gets countered easily by CC, Silences, Tanks (Armor/MR), peels, etc. They're squishy as hell, takes lots of skill (usually), and their job is to kill. Knowing this, you can't just say they're op because they can kill you easily at melee range, because that's what they're made for. They however, lack in Teamfights due to being squishy and easily countered by focusing or cc. So, just letting you guys and the author know before they bash on every melee assassins.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; But wasn't King Harald a descendant of a proper scandanavian viking?

I haven't studied it, but I'm fairly sure he and his predecessor Edward the Confessor, were both Anglo-Saxons. King Cnut was king of England, Norway and Denmark. I'm not sure how that worked. 
I've no idea about Beowulf, there had been some treaty dividing the country but there was probably some inter-marrying going on. TIL that Tolkien wrote a translation and an essay on Beowulf, that i might look up if I get time; probably the inspiration for the LoTR stuff.

If she wished to engage in relationships with other women, I'd leave personally but more power to you if you are cool with polyamory. 

I assume she means it when she says you are the love of her life and wants to marry you. How was your physical relationship? Did she enjoy sexual acts such as making out or beyond if you got that far? If so, her question should be answered. She would be bisexual. If she is questioning it, that would hint that she is either using the lesbian thing as a cover up to date women or she lied about what she felt.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt; I'm not a scholar and obviously can't understand what clear **english** truly says without years of study.

lol 

First off your not reading it in the original language, so any translation will be dependent on a authors opinion of a word. Let me show you why your aren't a scholar just with just one of the examples you put down.

&gt; 9:11, 

Hmm I'm not scholar but lets get more context about the whole chapter first....

&gt; 1 [This is a declaration of] disassociation, from Allah and His Messenger, to those with whom you had made a treaty among the polytheists.

Hmm this looks to be directed at polytheists, and not any polytheists but those who made this treaty. What is this treaty? A treaty of 4 months of peace. And what happened to this treaty? It was broken when the polytheists attacked and hindered their oath of peace. So your try to pull a verse and show Islam is violent and hostile without any knowledge of history or tafsir and got egg on your face. Heck, even in 9:6 it says:

&gt; And if any one of the polytheists seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the words of Allah . Then deliver him to his place of safety. That is because they are a people who do not know.

Give polytheist protect and deliver them to safety (your probably say ""well only if they convert"" which I say no, it says only so they may *hear*, and remember there is no compulsion in Islam.

This is how bad people use verses to make some people hurt other people, Muslims or non Muslims. They take a message direct to a specific time, a specific event, and a specific enemy(not a entire people or ideology) and tell others we/or they do this all the time. How can you analyze a verse and say ""People who don't think like that aren't Muslim; they're rejecting what is clearly written in the Quran"" when you don't even know the** Period of revelation**, **historical background**, and all the **themes and subject** matter of the ENTIRE chapter. 

You are literally doing what ISIS and other evil groups do, are you proud of yourself?","1417392797"

"3Dmodeling","t5_2sawg","Well, I got a couple minutes, let me see if I can give you some good advice.

It shouldn't take longer than about six months to get pretty good at just modeling. Firstly, I suggest you download Blender (but only because it's free). Maya is the industry standard, and frankly it's easier to use than Blender, and you might be able to score a student license straight from the Autodesk site.

You need to learn basic modeling tools, which should be pretty similar no matter which app you use. These are things like extrude, bevel, splitting polys, and merging verts.

A great place to get started is to jump over to YouTube and look up 'speed modeling'. Videos like this will give you a feel of how to go about modeling. You want to practice modeling pretty much until you can model *anything* and you can imagine the process of modeling in your head.

So there's modeling, but you can also learn:

- UV Unwrapping. You'll need to know how to do this if you want to texture your models.

- Diffuse, Specular, Normal maps. These are the main texture files that you'll use to texture your models.

- Rigging. Building a posable skeleton for your movable models.

- Animation. Pretty easy to get your head around, just takes a lot of time. (Pose, key, next frame. Pose, key, next frame. Pose, key...)

- Compositing. Combining your 3D models/materials/animations with live-action footage.

- Sculpting. A bit like modeling, but will feel like you're carving digital clay.

- Rendering. Generating a production image from your 3D environment, also what's happening while I'm typing this.

- Game Design. GD can incorporate all of the above, to one degree or another. There's also programming, bugfixing, networking, insomnia, and drinking problems involved.","1417392798"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt; Also, the trade embargo thing isn't really confusing (within the scope of the entire trilogy). Palpatine is using the trade federation to strangle his own planet to drum up a sympathy vote for him as Chancellor. He also uses the Queen to get the current Chancellor thrown out. Maybe it's not interesting, but it certainly isn't confusing. 

That's not what people are confused by. Everyone gets that.

There's several problems.

One: the Trade Federation are the foreground villains of the piece, but we have no understanding of what the hell they are up to. Yes, Palpatine's pulling the strings, but we're given no reason why the Federation doesn't cut those strings and go home. They're just being evil stooges for no reason, and that makes for bad drama.

Two: Palpatine's actions once the movie starts make no sense in the context of his plan. His every order to the Trade Federation and Darth Maul will result in nobody making it to Coruscant to complain about the invasion. His plan only works because his underlings fail.

Three: No stakes. We never see what's so awful about the Trade Federation taking control of Naboo. We're told some vague stuff about people dying, but we never see it. If the movie wants us to care about the Jedi succeeding, it has to give us an idea of what will happen if they fail.","1417392798"

"ketorecipes","t5_2t46o","In the top photo, going from left to right, you have a tuna stuffed pepper, then a few slices of pickled jalapeños, then half a slice of bacon, and finally a slice of muenster cheese. 

For the filling, I used:

* Two cans of tuna
* Two hard boiled eggs
* 5 tablespoons of mayo

I halved two green peppers and roasted them on their own in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes or so just to get them a bit pliable. To each pepper, I added:

* 1/4 of the tuna mix (came out to about 115g per pepper half)
* Three pickled jalapeños from a jar. I used B&amp;G, any brand is fine.
* Half a slice of bacon that I cooked in the microwave
* One slice of muenster cheese

I baked all four on a foil lined sheet pan just until the cheese was melted, about 10 minutes. Then, I put two of them into my facehole.

Makes: 4 servings. 1 serving: Half a stuffed pepper.

**Nutritional info per half stuffed pepper** (rounding up): 24g fat, 27g protein, 2.5g carbs, 340 calories. Depending on amounts and brands, YMMV.

They were pretty fucking delicious and the pepper gave me that much needed crunch that I sometimes miss while on keto.","1417392802"

Since then one cousin had a baby, another moved in with her boyfriend, etc.  

I'd prefer not to completely omit SOs because there are a couple of people whose SOs I definitely want to invite.  However some of them are as young as 23...and if I invite 23 year-old friends to bring SOs, the 20 year-old will want to know why her SO was excluded...and then we start giving mice cookies!","1417392803"

The main surfing season here is during the summer but you can still surf here year round. Unless you're a big wave surfer you'll probably spend most days at La Punta.

Unless you're dead-set on having language class be part of your fun, you could probably skip the course...a friend of ours visited us from Australia and did courses and after 2 weeks he still could hardly say anything, ha.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; ""Well, what would we expect if Jesus were who he claims to be?"" looks rather like the world does,

I would very much disagree with that. 

If Jesus was who he claimed to be, I would expect that more people would have written about their encounters with this being. I would expect that more contemporary sources would have reported people claiming this happened. 

I would not expect people to lie about certain texts claiming that those texts mentioned this leader attempting to create the illusion that this religion has more historical basis then it does. Yet, this has been proven to have happened. It is a fact that there was text added to Josephus to make it look like he talked about Jesus more than he did. (the only part that is agreed by scholars to be a legitimate reference to Jesus in Josephus is ""Jesus the brother of James"" which is says nothing about who Jesus was) 

&gt; ""Ahh you say, but that's because of evangelism, what of other religions?""

I wouldn't say that is because of evangelism. There were many superstitious and  religious beliefs at that time. However, once Constatine became emporer there became a targeted effort to eradicate all other religious beliefs, and this started with constatine and only got bigger after that. After a while people started using more agressive methods to spread their religion (crusades, inquisition, burning at the stakes for heresy, and other violent methods) And that's why this religion survived. It's also why these other religions died out. They didn't die out because they weren't sustainable, or because they were just too obscure. They died out because of a targeted effort to eliminate them. That's also something I would expect from a false religion. Only a false religion requires violence to survive. If it's true, then we wouldn't have had to use a sword to convert people. 

&gt;   inexplicable tradition carried on originating from a middle eastern peasant who should have died in obscurity, as did many of his contemporaries who claimed to special divine powers, leading to the world's major religion.

This is also assuming from the beginning that the bible is true, and that all church historians are reliable, even though it has been proven that some Christians deliberately lied to make themselves look better. 

&gt; So we're already accepted the cupcake is on the table,

No we haven't. You made an assertion without backing it up, and I haven't accepted it yet. 

&gt; The ability to exercise free will implies there must be a scenario in which the proposition could be asserted in the negative

Which proposition? 

&gt;  A scenario denied if the premise is that God would remove all ambiguity.

Once again, convincing someone that Jesus is god does not force them to worship him. There are many who even if they believed Jesus was god would still choose to reject him. Therefore they would still have free will. 

You see it's not a choice between is there a god or isn't there. There are plenty of people who believe there is a god that still go to hell. The real choice is between accepting Jesus as your savoir or not. And it is possible to refuse Jesus, even if you know he is god. Satan did it, the demons do it. So can we","1417392807"

After a day like today, some people need to lose their jobs on the team, and as close as we are to the end, the front office. If Greg Olson won't be fired he should be bound and gagged to prevent any chance he may call a play. Darren McFadden and MJD? Cut em both. I'd rather see Michael Adam, Tim Tebow or a mall Santa take another snap before either of those two again. This raiders team didn't just look bad or god awful. They looked anemic and sickly. 0-52 is an unacceptable margin of defeat. I think I just felt Al Davis roll over in his grave.","1417392811"

Not in my experience. I've seen lots of sons of feminist single-mothers who had fearful sons yet strong (some a little too strong) daughters. I've watched these kids grow up and then have kids of their own.

&gt;I'm a strong critic of a school system that forces kids to sit still too much.

Me too. When I was a kid we played on the playground before and after school and had two recesses plus lunch. I think it's good for kids to get a lot of play in their day.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","&gt;So with that said, how does GG shine the truth and protect the movement's reputation?

Simple: We don't. Some people choose to call it out, and protest to the media, but we're met with silence, or [are told the harassment angle was deliberate](http://blogjob.com/oneangrygamer/2014/11/gamergate-abc-reporter-admits-they-chose-harassment-coverage-over-corruption/)

&gt;And do you find these methods to be effective in clearing GG's name?

Nothing will work, so it's best not to waste our efforts on it, IMO.

&gt;Also, outside of subreddits like this one, does the movement have any major platforms that they can spread the message of ethics reform from?

Twitter, obviously, and Tumblr, plus 8Chan.

&gt;Is it true that GG is anti-SJW and feminists (not women)?

Yes.

&gt;If so, why?

Because we're sick to fucking death of having their ideology shoved into our games, gaming media and so on.

I'm a woman, and I fucking HATE listening to the ""but women have it SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad"" narrative. I'm sick of being told that I can't like sexualised women in games because it panders to MALE sexuality. Guess what? I love sexualised women in my games. Why? Because it's an escape from reality. The reality that I'm not sexy. Mostly, I just don't give a flying fuck how the character looks since I'm an FPS gamer for the most part, or Diablo 3, and thus don't really SEE the character often at all, rendering it irrelevant how she looks.

I've also been a gamer for 25 years, and have NEVER experienced anything like is claimed. No exclusion just because I have tits, no harassment or threats. Nothing. Nada.

&gt;what is the purpose of hating on SJWs (other than them being snobs)?

As I mentioned above, to get them to stop shoving their beliefs down my throat. They're like fucking Jehova's Witnesses, coming around with ""Have you embraced feminism and renounced your cis-het male privilege?"". *vomit*

&gt;SJWs are annoying sure, but why does GG, the movement, not like SJWs or at least associate themselves with NotYourShield?

Not quite following. NYS is a sister-movement to GG where those of us who don't fit the bullshit ""straight white men = gamer"" narrative being peddled can stand up and say ""fuck you"" to those who're erasing our existence.

Sorry if this comes off as aggressive. Lack of sleep makes me a tad grumpy and I got up at 05:30am and slept horribly last night. Plus, the SJWs piss me right off.","1417392812"

For there to be any real risk of take down you need to do some seriously illegal shit like CP, drug sales etc. I would worry way more about the hosting. Use a dedicated server on something like OVH or Nforce, they don't care unless someone force them to act (everyone uses them for seedboxes, and they never do anything about it), AVOID shared hosting like the plague. VPS's are better, but still not as good as dedis.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","No, Britain has not been self-sufficient in food since basically the late 18th century. By that point, it became clear to British policy-makers that not only would Britain no longer be an exporter of food, as it had been in much of the early modern period, they would have to import in years of poor harvests. In years of abundance Britain could mostly feed itself. 

The situation was largely disrupted by the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, however, as imports were harder to come by and prices rose substantially. This actually led to some important pieces of legislation with long-term consequences, including the implementation of the Speenhamland System in 1798 and the passage of the Corn Laws in 1815. The Corn Laws were a series of duties on imported grain implemented at the conclusion of the wars in order to keep grain prices high, and to continue the period of prosperity for landowners. Britain's population growth, however, meant that the problem of short food worsened over time. This led to the period (retrospectively) called the ""Hungry 40s,"" and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846: with their repeal, we get proper ""Free Trade"" in food for Britain. 

At that point, in 1846, British farmers typically produced about 75% of the wheat that Britons consumed. By World War I, less than 70 years later, that figure had dropped to less than 20%. And, in addition to wheat, Britain imported massive quantities of preserved and refrigerated meat from the US, Argentina, and Australia; butter and other dairy products from New Zealand, and continental Europe; and an assortment of other products like tropical fruits. These added to Britain's prior dependence on the tropical world for its chemical stimulants like coffee, tea, chocolate, sugar, and tobacco (not a food, but useful to consider in the same category), as well as spices. This utter dependence on overseas farmers was obvious their enemies in both World Wars, as evidenced by the resources Germany put into submarines. Their principal goal was to disrupt the trade in food between Britain the rest of the world--especially North America--enough to force the UK to a negotiated peace. Convoys, the US and Royal Navy, rationing, and government support for intensive agriculture prevented this from happening both times. In 1947, the wartime support for agriculture (itself a fascinating story of top-down environmental management) was made permanent with subsidies for intensive agriculture. Britain abandoned the free market for its food supply, and has been much more capable of feeding itself since then.

Also, I should point out that Ireland was in no way part of a separate economic system in the 18th and 19th centuries. It has long served as a combination of captive market for British goods and a supplemental granary for British stomachs.

Your response to her tells her that, while professionally you may have become the man you always wanted, emotionally you are still a train wreck, even after 9 months of separation, which IMO is not healthy. There is a lot of shit you still haven't moved on from.

In my opinion it is done with her. Mostly because of the way YOU appear to feel about her. You do not trust this woman and appear to hate her guts, why are you trying to get back with her any way?

Learn some theorems in this area and attempt some exercises. Repeat and rebuild until you solve the big problem.

Ahora mismo no se sabe cuantas prostitutas ejercen en Suecia, ni en que condiciones precisamente por las absurdas leyes impuestas, lo que paradójicamente está beneficiando a las mafias.

Por cierto los informes hechos por las autoridades danesas demuestran que una mayoría aplastante de prostitutas ejercen la prostitución libremente en Dinamarca.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","If you go to 15:14 in the video, you'll see a benchmark showing Intel scoring almost 100% more fps on average than AMD in Planetside 2. Why? Because the game only utilizes one core at 100%. Also, interestingly, Intel was almost 130% better in minimum fps. The difference slightly diminishes in 1440p, but that's because the game starts to get very GPU bound because of the resolution.

I thought I'd already explained why I'm comparing the fx 8320 and the i5 4690k, they are clocked the same so it's easier to compare them in percentages. We're not talking about price now, we are talking about single core performance. 

And those benchmarks you showed me are comparing an 8350 which is clocked at 4/4.2Ghz and the other Intel CPUs are at 3.4-3.9Ghz. That's around a 10-12% difference in clock speeds. AGAIN, we are comparing percentages, and for percentages, both CPUs have to have the same frequency. 
Overclock that i7 4770k to 4.2Ghz, the difference would be 70%, not 60% and that fits perfectly into my 70-100% estimate.
It is a fact that one Intel core clocked at 3.5GHz equals one AMD core clocked at 6.2-7.00GHz.

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","The author may have different answers, but I would like to give your questions a stab. 

There already has been a time where planning was used in agriculture, which was during the Second World War. Food supplies could easily be planned. For a given size and age-structure, total food requirements could be calculated. Presuming that this is (by and large) a non-capitalist economy, food would come from the following sources: imports, socialized farms and fisheries, and private farms and fisheries. For the sake of it, let's assume that long-term contracts were negotiated for the imports, so (barring catastrophic drought in those countries, or a political mishap that cuts off supplies) there would be some reliability when it comes to expecting what food supplies will come already.

The precariousness comes with what happens at home. How would we achieve the target level of output here? Output fluctuates with weather, so exact planning is not going to be perfect. Fluctuations could theoretically even out by carrying out a policy of holding buffer stocks over time, I'd assume. 

....

Well, every modern industrial economy needs some sort of process by which the unknown becomes the known. Incalculable elements of national psychology and culture enter the equation, like people wanting four cupholders over two. 

For automobiles, there will first and foremost eventually have to be a decision as to whether to extend or restrict the use of cars in the first place, which will have major industrial implications. Here where I am (the U.S.) the automobile industry directly and indirectly employs millions of people making cars, making components, providing petrol, servicing, building and repairing roads, and so on. The layout of cities and the forms of retail trade are influenced by car ownership. Planning is the only mechanism by which this relationship could change in a systematic way. If a decision is made to restrict the use of private cars, the plan must call for the redeployment of the labor associated with the car industry.

But to get back to product quality, there could be competing design teams. Maintaining a line between pure research, applied research, product development, and mass production seems to be crucial in promoting innovation. While Spacex and Google is cool and all, Asian capitalisms have had the benefit in economic performance over the West precisely because the state has been so involved in fostering R&amp;D in electronics.

I don't think the empiricist would say that there is any.

And we can do this with mind-body interactions too.

&gt; As an aside, can you explain why my immaterial mind seems only able to have a casual relationship with my material body and no other material things?

You learnt to use the expression ""my material body"" (or some version of this--your way of speaking here is peculiar) in relation to your sensorimotor engagement with the world, where you understood to be yours that body whose movement you could elicit volitionally, whose location in space relative to other bodies you felt as a sensation of resistance exercised by those bodies, and whose interactions with other bodies you perceived visually were correlated with tactile feelings you experienced at the same time.

"podemos","t5_31h78","Excelente noticia. Los militantes y simpatizantes de IU no se han dejado embaucar por la miserable campaña de difamación que desencadenaron los cínicos burócratas pringados hasta el fondo en el blindaje político de Blesa en Caja Madrid y en el cogollo de la corrupción inmobiliaria madrileña. Esta gentuza ha causado un daño enorme a este país, para empezar ser corresponsables de un agujero de 20.000 € en Bankia y el consiguiente Rescate europeo que tiene secuestrada y amarrada toda la política del Estado.

También podemos sacar valiosas moralejas sobre la irresponsabilidad de una prensa canalla que acepta servir de vehículo  a las filtraciones de los corruptos(desesperados por conservar sus poltronas), por oscuros intereses materiales o por odio ideológico y sectario.

La secuencia de informaciones injuriosas en ABC, La Razón y VozPópuli son una antología de la difamación de manual, rozando el ridículo en algunos casos, tal era la prisa y la ansiedad por descubrir cualquier cosa con utilidad denigratoria que hasta llegaron a confundir a un extraño homónimo con el padre de Tania Sánchez, atribuyéndole un piso de protección oficial con la intención de sugerir trato de favor .O publicar trivialidades como que un concejal de Medio Ambiente subvencione un proyecto de una asociación ecologista(debería dárselo a alguna asociación de la Guardia Civil, ¿eh?), que tiene entre sus miembros a la propia Tania, hija suya, que no lo oculta sino que lo publica bien grande en su web oficial del Ayuntamiento ,y otros militantes de IU, como si fuera raro que una organización política con fuerte compromiso ecologista tenga militantes de este estilo y participen en proyectos así, que consideran legítimamente de utilidad pública, y como no son millonarios para financiarlos, pues tienen que solicitar subvenciones municipales, acogiéndose a los presupuestos asignados a tales fines, dentro de unas prioridades políticas, además aprobadas por los electores.

Si los militantes del PP quieren conseguir subvenciones similares, pues que den el callo y formen asociaciones así, con proyectos solventes y reales. pero mucho me temo que no estén por la labor, y lo consideren ""chorradas de vagos y rojos"".

En algunos posts he insistido en este asunto porque me parece un ejemplo perfecto de lo que nos espera en los próximos meses. Todo militante, todo simpatizante, todo cargo electo de Podemos va a ser atacado por cualquier cosa que haga o diga; se nos acusará de ser personas poco fiables simplemente porque así ocurre siempre con el desafío emergente a un poder moribundo. En sus últimos estertores es cuando se vuelve más peligroso, preparémonos, pues, para tener toda la firmeza necesaria, este país no cuenta con muchas más oportunidades

Sólo me resta felicitar a los militantes y simpatizantes de IU por su ilustración y coraje .Que emprendan rápido una limpieza contundente y consigan enviar pronto a la cárcel(pero ante todo al paro, fuera de las instituciones y fuera de la militancia), a tales siniestros personajes..

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","&gt; If a quad core i5 and an 8 core fx perform the same in multithreaded applications that are able to utilize up to 8 cores, which is true, wouldn't it then be expected that an i5 performs two times better than an 8 core fx in applications that only utilize up to 4 cores?

Being multithreaded is not the same as being able to make full use of every core available. For most tasks, there's only so much you can offload to additional threads. Past 4 threads, it gets really hard for a programmer to find things to put onto additional threads, unless the task you're doing just happens to be something that's easy to chop into small atomic parts and distribute.

The advantage comes when you're doing a lot of different things that can all benefit from an extra thread or three. Most benchmarks don't really capture that unless they simulate actual loads.

&gt; The i5 has 4 cores, the fx has 8 cores. If they both perform roughly the same in programs that utilize 8 cores, that means the i5 is roughly 100% better core-per-core and the evidence suggests that this is indeed true.

It's not a valid comparison because multithreading doesn't actually work that way. Say I write an app. Say I shove all the actual work off to a second thread, leaving one thread for the UI and one for a worker. That's ""multithreaded"" but it's not going to get any additional benefit from having eight cores over four cores, or probably even four over two. This is why we ought not expect some major difference between the two--there's only so many things you can divide into threads in most sorts of programs, and there's definitely diminishing returns there unless the task just happens to be something that can be fairly divided in an atomic manner.

It's the same reason not every task can be pushed onto a cluster even though some tasks can be efficiently distributed. The same sort of tasks, in fact.

It's not meaningful to take the end result and divide it by the number of cores on a desktop benchmark because even the benchmarks that are multithreaded do not evenly divide the workload among an arbitrary number of threads. It simply does not yield a useful measurement. What would give you a useful measurement is forcing the system to use a single core and measuring *that* performance. But that doesn't yield the numbers you're claiming, it yields a difference more along the lines of 50-60% in single threaded performance.","1417392832"

Loss of bair was a nerf, but Gordos are better than Waddle Dees, his smashes are better, his grab game is still great. He still has a chaingrab (dthrow --&gt; upair --&gt; fastfall --&gt; regrab). His offstage game is even better. His recovery snaps to ledges. His jab is better. He's incredibly tough to KO. He can juggle like a pro. Downthrow leads into more than just more downthrow. Combos against him are way harder than you give them credit for. And as I've said before, multiple times, he can still ""bait and switch."" Just because it's a new game doesn't mean he has no options, it means that you're stuck in a Brawl mindset.

Everything else you said was unsubstantiated bullshit.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","-shrug- Well, first, I didn't say that the ""top 9% are upper middle class"". That makes no sense, since it defines everyone above that as middle class. I said $90K, specifically, is upper middle class.

Maybe we need another word between ""middle class"" and ""wealthy"", but when I think wealthy, I don't think grabbing one person at random and 1 out of 11 will be wealthy. More like 1 out of 100 (at least) or more like 1 out of 500. Wealthy, to me, is ""this person could stop working right now and they're set for the rest of their life.""

I understand that many people make a lot less than $90K, and it probably seems like a hell of a lot to someone making, say, $30K, but expenses go up really fast when you improve your lifestyle. A $90K lifestyle is not 3x better than a $30K lifestyle. A $90K lifestyle doesn't look even remotely like what people think of when they think of a ""wealthy lifestyle"". That doesn't get you into the ritzy neighborhood, it gets you into the upper middle class neighborhood -- maybe. If you live in the right part of the country.","1417392833"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories. I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone. I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care. The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome. That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator. All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me?","1417392835"

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","I was seventeen, on my first holiday with only friends, and I was drunk on Captain Morgan's Dark Rum on a beach in Norfolk. I had my pirate hat on (a drinking tradition) and felt like a king. Drunk, I fell back into a chair, and watched my friends. They were happy - it was a good day, and a better evening. At some point, over walks Dani - she ducks down to be level with my chair, and was intentionally showing off her cleavage. Holy shit, that cleavage could be the last thing I saw and I'd die happy. She reaches over, takes my hat off my head, places it on her own, and says ""Am I a pirate now?""  
Pretentious and inebriated, attempting to be clever, I reply ""It's not the hat that makes a pirate, but the head he wears it on.""  
Without skipping a beat, she reaches into my jean, clutches my shaft, and asks me ""which head?""  
I don't know when I got an erection, but in those few seconds, I'd gone from flaccid and drunk to stone-cold sober, fully erect, and getting the closest thing to a handjob I'd ever had.  

Anyway, I bailed because she was going out with one of my best friends who was ten feet away from me and was also my ride.","1417392836"

It just seems inconsistent with that message to offer the viewer this ""oh hey we could totally prove she is right but we won't because ""spooky national security guy reasons"".

**Obesity is common, serious and costly**

Obesity-related conditions include heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, some of the leading causes of preventable death. 

The estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the U.S. was $147 billion in 2008 U.S. dollars; the medical costs for people who are obese were $1,429 higher than those of normal weight.
 
There is health in a RANGE of sizes. If you deviate from the normal range and believe in HAES you are bolstering your pride at the cost of your health. Like the post above said, HAES started out as a body positive movement and turned into a farce.","1417392838"

"writing","t5_2qh2n","&gt; What would [creative] writing be considered (Not the novel itself.)

I would say creative writing on its own is neither a product or a service. In my mind, creative writing is the process that leads to a product like a novel, play or movie. If someone specifically hires you to write something, then the creative writing is more of a service. 

&gt; What is more important to keep in mind; the service to the reader or the product itself?

I think these are one in the same. If the service to product is lacking, the reader will probably be disappointed and if the service to the product is high quality, then reader will probably be more satisfied. Of course, there are always going to be exceptions. 

I think it was Toni Morrison who said ""If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it."" This seems to be the literary equivalent to your Steve Jobs example.

If you are writing for someone else, you should cater to the audience they want, if you are writing for yourself you should write what your mind tells you to write.

It all depends on how things are going in my life, how much time I have, how I'm feeling, and more. I just sort of feel it out.

1g or less, I've found, is great for headaches that just don't want to be treated by anything else. It's also nice to get 'something' from a lower dose while I'm doing yard work or something else, something that could use a 'little bit of something extra', but something that 'more than a little extra' would ruin or make difficult.

If the bill of sale simply has none of the boxes checked and the title itself has the ""not actual mileage"" box checked, then that will also likely not be considered material.

If the bill of sale has the ""actual mileage"" box checked while the title has the ""not actual mileage"" box checked, the fact that there is a discrepancy between the two is very likely going to be sufficient for a court to determine that you should have been aware of a potential issue and clarified.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not sure if this is current news, but the fact that women cannot be prosecuted for raping/abusing/stalking/etc. a man (or other women) based on the 'fact' that women are not capable of raping/abusing/stalking/etc. and can only be raped/abused/stalked. Unless a child is involved, a woman can basically not be touched by the law in the UK in regards to these crimes.

I know that the US is pretty bad about this stuff too but at least it's acknowledged (in most states) that a man can be raped by a woman/man and leaves open the possibility for a man to report that they've been raped.","1417392842"

I have goals for a sub 20 5k by the end of this winter, and my training runs on easy days are in the low to mid 7:00s, tempos in mid 6:00s, long runs at 8:00 a mile straight up. ","1417392842"

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","Read the article. It's not about the capital controls. The title of the reddit post kind of suggests that it is, but it isn't. The actual article is about CFC law, which governs how the companies offshore which are owned by Russian individuals and firms are taxed. That they should be taxed as companies in Russia (based on certain exceptions and rules of course).

Once again, this is only bad news for large companies that try to stash their operations offshore to avoid taxes. This is good news for an average person, since the government will receive more money from these corrupt companies. ","1417392843"

Anyone who keeps harping on the fact that Wilson did not get indicted indicates his innocence is talking out of his ass. The only reason why the prosecutor allowed a grand jury is to pull wool onto every else that the investigation against Wilson is fair when it was anything but.","1417392843"
