&gt; From gun rights to terrorism to same-sex marriage, many leading advocates on the right who grew frustrated with their country’s leftward tilt under President Barack Obama have forged ties with well-connected Russians and come to see that country’s authoritarian leader, Vladimir Putin, as a potential ally.
&gt; 
&gt; The attitude adjustment among many conservative activists helps explain one of most curious aspects of the 2016 presidential race: a softening among many conservatives of their historically hard-line views of Russia. To the alarm of some in the GOP’s national security establishment, support in the party base for then-candidate Donald Trump did not wane even after he rejected the tough tone of 2012 nominee Mitt Romney, who called Russia America’s No. 1 foe, and repeatedly praised Putin.",1493596800

Prioritize stronger single-shot weapons over weaker automatics. Early on, weak shots from a pistol or shortbow have a high chance to enrage animals, but lethal shots from pila or greatbows means most animals don't have a chance.  Assault rifles are about as low-tier as I'll go for automatic weapons, and even then I prefer survival rifles at that level.  

For minor amounts of crossfire micromanagement doable at 2x speed, simply draft-then-un each time a colonist scores a kill. That'll prevent them from wandering up into the line of fire to haul, and instead pick a new target. ",1493596801

If you're wearing a coat outside, then the cable of the ear buds running from your poclet is inconvenient no matter if it's inside or outside, so Bluetooth ear buds are also really cool.

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","So a while back there was a similar thread that kicked me into a two day anxiety attack.  Honestly, I'm a successful 35 year old woman with her own house, financially stable, great job, amazing friends and has HSV2.

I've had long-term three partners - and one intimate relationship outside of those.  I was extremely safe in all but my last long term (8+ years) relationship where I contracted it shortly after meeting him.  Thing was - he had no idea he was a carrier - he'd never seen any symptoms (this honestly is a thing - most people don't actually know they're carrying and not as diligent as those in this sub).  But at that point in time - we were perfect for one another, I saw myself with him for the rest of my life and HSV2 was an annoying skin rash I'd just have to deal with as there was no going back.

That relationship ended a year and a half ago - and threads like these make my anxiety hit a 10/10 as I start to contemplate dating again it's very clear that the annoying skin rash that I contracted - that I know how to control (through meds, the right combo of vitamins, a healthy diet, exercise and keeping stress down) is apparently going to be a huge deal to someone else.  

Yeah, not something that will ever be cured, understood all other tests I've had done have been negative.  I will never hide it from someone, I will always disclose well before any form of intimacy - but reading these threads make me think that I'll be alone with my cat pretty much the rest of my life due to what I consider to be an annoying skin rash.  

Honestly - I'm not a terrible person - I've not slept around, been unfaithful, lied or hidden anything from anyone.  I'm a wonderful person and I hope that one day someone will see past this.

I'll not be checking this sub frequently as honestly I feel like the anxiety and shame I feel after reading things like this isn't worth it.",1493596803

Because here we see Sigma, he's kind of walking in to this with a bit of  grin on his face.  But from what he's said, he might be overconfident but he realizes what he's going to do is going to be for a greater purpose.  That purpose being...  Stop the red maverick that's killing everything for fun.

The fight begins and it's pretty clear that Sigma isn't thinking much of Zero.  The light surprise when Zero rushes at him, I take that to be more of a ""this guy's really just going straight at me?"" response.  For a short bit the fight seems to be mostly Sigma just toying with Zero for a bit, until he decides to try ending the fight.  Only to be surprised that Zero isn't even fazed by the impacts.  Which puts Sigma on the defensive, so much so that he decides to bring his saber out and try to put an end to it quickly.  Sigma does get his wish...  Only it turns out to be a monkey's paw because he had to pay an arm for it.

In the end, the only reason Sigma won was because Zero ended up stalled for that unknown reason and was wide open as a result.  Sigma knows that this victory was an absolutely lucky break, and the fight itself left him so broken that he couldn't even be what was his usual self.

...'Course.

Fournette could very well turn in a season we saw from Gurley year 1 and end up top 5, with ~1200+ yards 10TDs.

McCaffrey has questions regarding goal-line where we can assume JStew will take these so a ceiling of 200 carries, 80 receptions 8TDs on offense 4 receiving, 4 rushing (maybe some additional returning). 

Cook also has some depth questions, will he take goal-line carries or Murray. I also think he'll be on the field less than either Fournette or McCaffrey.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","TL;dr: Prohibitions in Lev 17-26 focus on religions that are present in the vicinity of the Israelites.  The prohibition against homosexuals is incorrect because the focus was for prohibition of male and female ritual prostitution practices of local religions that existed concurrently with the Israelites.

Thanks for doing the leg work to itemize the verses.  We're in agreement about a lot.  Let me clarify because I was pulling up what I remembered from a week long case study I did on these chapters over five years ago.

I think we can both agree on a good portion of the following statement:
Lev 17-26 (Holiness Code) is focused heavily on creating laws that draw a line between the Israelites and the religions that worshipped Baal, Asherah, and Molech.  This allows for the invading Israelites to differentiate between themselves and the ""Others"" that live and exist alongside of them in the Holy Land.  The laws found throughout the Torah codified the Israelites ""xenophobia"" and allowed for the Israelites to ultimately populate the area without immediately blending/dulling their ancestral cultural practices with the cultural practices of the Others.  To use your point:
&gt;Leviticus 20 begins in discussing ""any man of Israel..."" having some form of intercourse, with ...specifically, those who worship the god Molech.

By the time the OT narrative gets to Judges, we're able to see what happens when the tribes of Israel bred with aliens from outside of their tribe/faith/orthopraxy (see Judges 2:12).

I don't have any idea if there is transcription of what beliefs were held by the Others during the time that the Holiness Code was disseminated throughout the Israelites, so I can only assume that many of these practices that are prohibited by the Law were observed to be ritual and cultural standards of the Others.  We do know that the Torah mentions sacrifices, scarification, idolatry, and **ritual prostitution**.

We know that Shrine/Ritual Prostitution was a practice of the Others:
&gt; There were even male shrine prostitutes in the land; the people engaged in all the detestable practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites.
&gt;1 Kings 14:24, NIV (see also: 2 Kings 23:7)

And we know that the Jews were already practicing foreign ideas by carrying idols throughout the Wilderness:
&gt;“Did you bring me sacrifices and offerings forty years in the wilderness, people of Israel?  You have lifted up the shrine of your king, the pedestal of your idols, the star of your god- which you made for yourselves.  Therefore I will send you into exile beyond Damascus,” says the Lord, whose name is God Almighty.""
&gt;Amos 5:25-27 NIV, (also see: Joshua 24:23)

So far we agree that the Holiness Code is to reiterate what is HEBREW and what is NOT HEBREW in order to protect the cultural and religious practices that were inherited and carried from Abraham to Slavery in Egypt to Leviticus.  Many within the Israelites had already adopted practices from outside faiths by the time the Law was given to the people, so this is a ""deep cut"" that clarifies everything (on top of the 10-commandments) that helps the Priests to *really* drive home the point.

So this is where you asked for clarification, and I apologize for being loose with my statements from recall:
&gt;...It's also not an issue of cross dressing and I'm not sure why that's even a part of the discussion as it's not implied anywhere... but I'm not familiar with anything in that culture that suggests that crossdressing would be as, or more, likely of a phenomenon than homosexual practices.

The crossdressing I referred to in my linked comment was a mistake.  I was referring to male and female ritual prostitution which (and this is something I do not have quote for but recall from two university-level Old Testament classes confirming the same) the tents of prostitutes in the High Places.  Please review my claims about the HC in light of this clarification.  

My hypothesis is this: ""The Holiness Code from Leviticus is designed to tell the Israelites what outside-faith practices are not allowed.  Because of the Bible's repeated emphasis on prohibitions against ritual prostitution, and because of OT's lack of emphasis on prohibition of homosexuality, we can infer that the often cherry-picked verse prohibiting homosexuality is in fact focused on prohibiting the ritual prostitution (both male and female) that was practiced by the faiths of Baal, Asherah, and Molech.""

I apologize additionally for shifting to NT focus with my argument, I was trying to make an easy jump between what Paul wrote about how Christians are to view intimacy/intercourse because he did the leg work.

Good discussion.  Digging your POV.

"evangelion","t5_2r6ex","To me the series more than anything else is a treatise on trauma, anxiety and existential suffering.

All the characters suffered a massive trauma and demonstrate various [counter productive] coping mechanisms throughout the series and what many fans truly seek through Shinji isn't the resolution of the plot per se but him overcoming his anxiety. That is why for so many the TV ending seems more fitting.

The way Shinji dealt with the loss of his mother and rejection of his father was to disengage with life. He convinced himself that it was better to float through life with no associations because it was less troublesome that way. But like most anxious people he is a hypocrite because at his core he desperately desires intimacy, ergo he is so easily manipulated by his father. Throughout the series we see him struggle against this narrative he had defined for himself, his mantra became 'I mustn't run away' being not the situations themselves, he has a frankly baffling capacity to deal with unbelievable bullshit, but rather the belief that he doesn't deserve intimacy, that for him to desire or strive is wrong or silly. 

That's why the metaphor he explores in that final episode means so much. He didn't want a world of nothingness, something that traumatised people so frequently convince themselves they desire and achieve through disassociation or self medication. Instead he wanted intimacy, and he came to appreciate that to get that he had to be willing to reach out, to take a chance to be hurt and to a degree had to see that he was doing it all along. That is what living always was. It's a real Wizard of Oz style approach. No place like home, it was in you all along, the dog being a penguin. 

I don't think one ending is better than the other. I personally think the TV series is clever and well executed, but the EoE is the actual resolution to the plot and while that is 'less important' it is still, you know, important. 

Note I would say that clinical or chemical depression, bipolar, schizophrenia and other disorders like that aren't necessarily what are being covered in this series. Many of the characters have clear environmental sources, in fact many of them show PTSD symptoms. I could understand how someone who is suffering clinical depression might find the insights and the progress he makes contrived as a result, though I would invite them to reflect on the way their disorders also tend to be comorbid with anxiety disorders and the ways people often have to disassemble those concurrent to dealing with their chemical imbalances.

In 6.88, Oracle has received some important nerfs. Most significant one is base damage reduction, as it has put his damage below the necessary for zoning offlaners, so this means pos 5 Oracle is far weaker.

As I said in above post, he os one of the heroes who need either better talent and/or make it non-competing. As a pos 5, you want high cast range spells so you can cast it outside of harm, but his cast range talent is at level 25, which not only is hard to obtain from most games, but also competes with +2s ult duration. Level 20 talent is just useless as neither movement speed will save you neither extra intelligence is valuable at this point. 60 gpm at level 15 is too weak (Phoenix has 150, 2.5x more).

I'd probably do in this way:

* Level 10: 20% experience gain or +15 intelligence
* Level 15: +150 cast range or +120 gold per minute
* Level 20: -40s respawn time or +300 health
* Level 25: +2s False Promise duration or XX 

Another thing that could make improvement is Fate's Edict being two separate effects instead of a single effect and allied dispel only dispelling the disarm instead of disarm + magic resistance. Before, this could be justified as improving the skill cap, but after 6.86 giving Oracle the chance of dispelling allies and Guardian Greaves/Lotus Orb, there are big chances that Fate's Edict will be dispelled by the other support/offlaner consequently to Lotus Orb use.",1493596810

And if you recall, we're in a thread discussing how shitty this subreddit has gotten, so it's fair to point out that the general consensus in here and in /r/politics is that as long as Trump said it, it must be ridiculed. As evidenced by the fact that a claim that is strongly supported here is then turned around and reposted in a clickbait fashion with the main appeal being that Trump said it so he must be instigating something. And sure Trump's administration is trying to sell a war, but it's one that will happen if nothing is done to prevent it, because that's the whole point of all these missile tests that have been going on lately.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt; But thank you so much for changing my view. You made me even more convinced. Your response epitomized everything wrong with BLM and their supporters. 

How is it logical to change your view to be more strong based on arguments you don't like?  Someone makes a straw man (that's not what a straw man is, but let's assume it is for now), then why would it convince you of the opposite?  That doesn't make any sense.  Clearly there's a strong emotional investment here on your part... there's nothing inherently wrong with that, but it's something you need to acknowledge.  

This is the second time you've perceived a direct accusation of racism where none existed.  You appear very, very motivated to shift the conversation to that, and when you feel like an accusation of prejudice has been made, it seems to make you quite angry and upset.  

It's fine that you feel this way, but do you see how it's a potential problem if you  start seeing your own feelings about racism as central to the issue of how Black people are treated in the US? 

&gt;How many people you kill is the degree to which you are engaged in ethnic cleansing. That's the metric of ethnic cleansing: murders.
You then proceed with another massive straw man. I didn't say one man from Toronto is my reason. First of all it's a woman. More importantly, I said her, the founder of the entire movement, dozens of others, and the statements released by the organization itself are the problem. No I didn't list literally every statement every person associated with BLM has ever said in the OP.

If these statements exist, you didn't supply them.... all I can go on is what you said.  You had one quote that was extreme (the Toronto person), one quote that was hyperbole, and later, one totally mundane point about the school-to-prison pipeline that you confusingly interpreted as some kind of accusation of personal racism.  These are, to put it colloquially, weaksauce.  You keep implying there's all these terrible quotes that you won't say, but I don't have access to those, so how am I supposed to address them?

My point with the post you're replying to is that you are, for someone who supposedly cares about racial justice, spouting all the usual suspects people use to reject Black Lives Matter.  Your argument here is indistinguishable from someone that of someone on the alt-right... you're using the same quotes and evidence and arguments they use.  

You say you agree with the basic ideas of BLM, but every time a specific issue is down on the table, you're against it.  You disagree with the school-to-prison pipeline, and potentially institutional racism in education generally.  You disagree with the idea that police shoot black people dispoportionately.  These things are *a major part* of caring about racial issues in the US.  If you disagree with them, you don't just dislike how BLM talks, you disagree with progressive politics in terms of these issues.

And that's fine (I disagree with it, but it's fine), but it's impossible to do this and also have to maintain the self-concept that you agree with all the issues.



&gt; Finally, rejecting the main group trying to accomplish goals is not practically the same thing at all. 

Then what are you doing to address this problem yourself?  If the issue is important to you, but you don't like BLM, have you... I dunno, started your own group?  Practically, what's the difference between rejecting BLM and rejecting these issues altogether... especially when your priorities seem to be your own discomfort about being called racist?

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","&gt;&gt; I think I move too slow for online dating.

&gt; Nope, not possible!

I respect where you (and a few others of similar mind) are coming from—and in fact I love reading your posts, Hera—but I am going to respectfully disagree with this one particular thing, and for a very specific reason: logistics.

Logistics, timing, and old age for me are currently forming a bit of a perfect storm.  I'm almost sixty, don't have a whole lot of time left, don't have a whole lot of extra time in general, and if I would have to spend three to sixth months dating someone in a sort of ""slow mode""—and if I combine that with the two- to three-month period it seems to take to find the right person just to be dating the right person—then I'm only looking at potentially a few shots at this before I'm 70 and probably in permanent ED hell.  It's just not a viable strategy for someone in my position, especially since I'm going to be still working for awhile and hence can't devote 20 hours a week to socializing and meeting potential partners.

Believe me, I would love to do a ""friends first"" approach; I did that with a few people when I was in my twenties, with great results.  I don't have that much time for the investigative phase anymore, though.  It has to be much more on a fast track.  And from what I've seen, most people in their fifties are similarly inclined.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've been totally into this extremely attractive co-worker. We flirted for months until we finally got physical. For the next several months that followed, she fulfilled a lot of at-work fantasies. She'd get on her knees and give me a blowjob. She would totally get into it and would tell me to cum in her mouth, and of course, she swallowed. I'd get regular handjobs from her early mornings at her workstation before anybody in her area showed up. I'd often get to fingerbang her and even suck her tits. I titty fucker her too! Bless her amazing tits! I once made her fingerbang herself so I could suck her finger. Damn did her pussy taste good! Although she didn't let it be know, it was clear she was a freak. One time some of my cum got on her pants and she proudly left it there the whole day. Even in the middle of the workday, if nobody was around, she'd let me grab her tits, pussy, and ass. We eventually stopped doing this at work because she was afraid we'd get caught (there were a few close calls). We'd occasionally meet up after work for some beers. One of those times, we ended in the back of her car and she gave me an amazing blowjob. I thought she was getting into it when we'd do this at work, but (as she explained) being in a situation where we would not get caught, she *really* got into it. We talked about many other fantasies she'd be more than willing to fulfill but we never got around to it. She wanted to stop because she was feeling guilty. ",1493596817

It's worth noting that some names may not be available because they contain words that are not, or are no longer, allowed in name so they won't show up as taken in the database. 

For example, if you do a search for ""Iron Blade"" it will show as ""No data available in table"" (at least on US/PC) but that's because the word ""Iron"" can no longer be used in a name as a separate word (maybe to protect the copyright of the Metal Man named ""Iron"", but it's kind of silly to not allow it as a separate word in other names).

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Let me spell it out for you.  If I have income and can pay for a place to live, I can also pay for another place to live.  That's just a matter of paying a different person for an equivalent service.  It doesn't (necessarily) cost more than paying for where I am living now. If there is a fire that destroys all my belongings, there is nothing to move, so it would just be a matter of finding a new apartment.  Yes, I would be out of all of that stuff, and that would suck, and I would have to buy some new stuff, eventually.

However, what is valuable about my stuff isn't its monetary value.  I have a lot of things that are essentially unique because I made them or they are tied to specific events in my life and are consequently irreplaceable.  Renter's insurance cannot replace it.  Can it get me a new computer, yes.  Can it replace all the data on that computer, no.  Can it replace all my drawings and artworks and obscure books and collected items, no.  I don't even know what the monetary value for them is, and it may very well be zero.

According to my roommate, renter's insurance here is about $25/month.  I might could afford that this month, but I don't have a long term job, and I can't really afford to pay random fees that will never have an ROI.  I definitely could not when we moved here, and I never know outside of a particular contract what I can afford.  Also I've lived in dozens of places which have not burned down, and none that have, so you're not going to make a lot of traction with me to pay a fee I can't afford, to cover an extremely unlikely circumstance, in which it won't do anything for me anyway.

If C9 wins the finals they will move into second place behind TSM and secure the second bye for the live finals. 

If you are referring to who is thought to be the best in the region, then the answer is still TSM is thought to be the best. Hammers and C9 are thought to be the next best teams in the region. Hammers are also the only team that TSM seems to have trouble against. If you are asking who is thought to be best in the world the answer is Armada from South Korea.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","It's possible and something you should consider if you are storing a life-changing amount, but it is not so likely.

Any hardware can be backdoored to steal Bitcoin private keys, including computers or hardware wallets.

In my opinion, I think that it's more likely a Bitcoin hardware wallet would have a backdoor that is targetted to steal Bitcoins than a common PC would.

I also think the real risk is a targetted backdoor, where a backdoor is put into some hardware that has been ordered by someone known to have a lot of Bitcoin. A backdoor put into every device would likely be found by someone.

The best advice I would give would be to go into a store and pick up a laptop box off-the-shelf randomly and buy it. That way you can be fairly certain that there isn't a targetted backdoor in your machine. Every one of those laptops would have to be backdoored, increasing the risk of someone else finding the backdoor.

Use that machine as an offline wallet for electrum/armory. Additionally you can use it to read/write important documents, and store important PGP keys etc.

One risk with an offline wallet is how you transfer data back and forth. Electrum lets you do this using webcams and QR codes, but IMO it's a bit too inconvenient and also cannot be used to transfer files (which you SHOULD NOT do without A LOT of care).

If you use a USB stick, a file you transfer can get infected and used to spread the infection, but a second risk is that the firmware on the USB stick gets reflashed by a virus. This kind of attack is very rare, but it is known the NSA has the capability to do these kinds of attacks. There is a cool device that can protect you from this:

https://hackaday.com/tag/usb-condom/

If you do plan to use a USB stick, have it be a dedicated stick that you only use on your online and offline PC, and get the smallest size you can (1GB is plenty).",1493596822

"TeemoTalk","t5_38i2f","To address each point:

1. Wits has INCREDIBLY strong late game scaling due to its synergy with Rageblade and Teemo E, which I explained above. 
2. Bork is terrible paired with wits, correct. But you dont build Bork on Teemo if you actually know what youre doing outside of specific lane matchups/ team comps. Same with the bloodrazor top fad. 
3. Youd still build Tabi/Mallet with on-hit, thats part of the core.
4. Runnans isnt needed, On-Hit Teemo plays to control a quarter of the map by slaughtering anyone that face checks into his shrooms and threatening a Sorc Elixir gambit if the enemy team ignores you. Wave clear is fast enough already with Rageblade and Wits. 
5. Visage is crap on on-hit Teemo. He doesnt need CDR, he gets more 10 more MR from wits, and he doesnt need the extra sustain

When you say ""Late Game Scaling"" I get the feeling you're uncomfortable with how cheap the item is and feel as though low cost=bad item late game. Look at the item as I explained in the context to Teemo and youll find its worth far more than you think. Going by the gold efficiency per stat explained on the wiki: http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Gold_efficiency

133.33 AP = 2899.9275g
25 MPen = 933.25
40% AS =1000
65 MR = 1170
Total = 6003.18g

Which is why I said Wits is such a retardedly strong item on Teemo.

She herself has some too, considering that she is planning on going back to school at some point. I think that at to be able to take our relationship to the next level, I'm gonna have to step up and work on some personal issues I feel I have, the ones I listed in the post. The fact that I withdrew from school has been a source of anguish for myself in the past, so I think it has caused me to be weary of going back only to drop out and waste money.

the only strategy I can think of is rush belias while trying to kill off one or two of the archaeodemons(without synergy..this'll probably be very difficult) as their Ultimate Gigaflare and Dark holy hit pretty hard.  accessories with petrify and silence resist will deff aid in preventing your party form being wiped(not really, **especially** with the adds U gigaflare spam and lifebreak to make things harder, plus Belias's powerful magic attacks as well)

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Em 1988 criaram a CSLL que nada mais é que um adicional de 9% do IR que só as empresas pagam.

Depois criaram o PIS (que antes era o fim social) e também o Cofins.

Depois o PIS/Cofins Importação,  que apesar da semelhança no nome não tem nada a ver com o Pis/Cofins e é só mais um imposto aduaneiro.

Em seguida aumentaram a alíquota do Pis e da Cofins tornando ambos não-cumulativos. 

A essa altura já foram criadas várias contribuições que só são pagas somente pelas empresas. Eu nem falei das CIDES (contribuições sobre intervenção no domínio economico) que devem ser mais umas 8 contribuições diferentes.

 As empresas já fizeram sua parte sim, essa coisa de criar mais e mais contribuições toda vez que a previdência não consegue pagar as contas é uma loucura. Vai arruinar nossa já pouca competitividade.

Nesse momento ou se aumentava a contribuição Precidenciaria dos funcionários  (como tentou fazer o RJ) ou se aumenta o tempo de contribuição, não existe uma terceira saída.

Conforme os juros forem sendo cortados isso vai fulminar a rentabilidade dos fundos de previdencia. Se o Brasil quiser deixar de ser ""um país de rentistas"" ele vai ter que ter uma reforma na previdência.",1493596825

An older, more established man is a good choice if you're into a more traditional dynamic and you're somewhat traditional yourself. Looking after a father figure is not inherently wrong, when it offers you stability.

OTOH, if you're looking for a 'partner in crime' type of relationship, then, usually, a smaller age gap is better. Besides, if you'd like to have children, but not in the next, say, couple of years, it might be easier with a younger guy, first and foremost from a practical point of view. Biologically as well.
I know there's a lot of bro science going around TRP about this, and yeah, *technically* a man can have children even in his, say, 80s, but the reality is just as female fertility and chance of healthy conception decreases, so does a male's.

Also, similar experiences build up similar characters/tastes/traits. Let's say I grew up in a good economic climate and my partner who is some years older experienced political and economical instability growing up. Those experiences alone bring up very different individuals, I would tend to be more careless with money in the sense that I'd spend it on culturally enhancing experiences while he would be much more down to earth, trying to secure a home, a stable career, etc. You can see how something simple as this can bring a lot of strain in a relationship with a big age gap.

Not really, a good example of your rule being broken is apartheid South Africa, far more black people than white but white privilege mattered quite a bit.  It's worth mentioning that whiteness being viewed as positive isn't just a facet of western culture anymore, and while I certainly don't have the international or racial knowledge to say exactly how this works, whiteness can still get you advantages in a county with a majority people of color. (one good example is that in countless places across the globe being white comes with the implication that someone has more money, thus improving their service.)

Prep and sanding is the same no matter what paint you use, although, you can get by with 400 grit single stage, where I'd sand with 600 for base. Depending, you could get away with one quart of green to do a b outside. Typically it gets mixed 1:1 so you have 1/2 gallon of mixed color. To be safe I'd get 3 pints, but I know what I'm doing. Now again, depending on the type of paint, it may mix 4:1:1 making less mix. Low voc stuff. I liked the old deltron that was 1:1:1/2, it's obsolete now. On that page I linked it has all the info on how to mix and use all the products. ""JAU"" is single stage urethane. 

People use single stage because it saves steps, typically 3 times around the car. With base / clear, you got 3 and 2 of clear, time is money. Personally I do everything base / clear. One reason is base is like lacquer, you can dump unused mix back in the  can, that shit is expensive to mix and toss. Single stage, once you mix you use. It's also easier to spray base. Generally, you are going to have trash, mistakes, so you plan on sanding and buffing when you paint in less than ideal conditions. Clear buffs nice, technically it's the same chemically as the single stage color, but I would clear solid colors because the sun is brutal here, the uv protection is nice. 

[I did a thing on one of my cars](http://imgur.com/a/1Y8nF), I painted this back in 2002, I know the color is diamont base, I don't know what clear I used. It was something I got free, the car sat out in the sun here all that time with no taking care of it, not even washing it. The clear eventually gave it up. I did this in 3 days in at tent in my front yard, with obsolete old old paint from the early 90's, again free. This color doesn't match the car, it was from our old race car, but you wouldn't notice. This car is hot as fuck inside with this color. If you follow the steps in the instructions, use the right shit, don't skip steps, it's pretty easy to paint a car.  ",1493596834

I'm to lazy to look it up, but I'm going to confidently guess that growing up as an orphan has been proven to have a pretty negative impact, probably more than being raised by gay parents.

allowing gays to adopt won't cause less hetero parents from adopting, it'll add to the number of children raised by parents rather than as orphans.

Do you generally believe that being raised by gay parents is worse than being raised as an orphan?

if not, do you for some other reason, disagree that this makes gay adoption worthwhile?



I cans see someone making the argument that some child who would've been adopted by a hetero family might end being raised by a gay couple. In this case, the hetero family is still going to adopt a child and one less child is going to grow up as an orphan. Unless you believe that the children who were going to be adopted by typical families but were instead adopted by gay families are much mroe valuable than the would-be orphans, then there isn't any argument that I can think of that allowing gay adoption move harmful to children than not allowing it.",1493596834

However, I'm starting to run out of T. I had gyno as a teen but had it removed, some glandular tissue was left in so my nipples are a bit perma weird but not too bad. I'm starting to run out of T and never really want it to end so I was thinking of dropping to a cruising dose to ride it out a little longer and add another compound on top of it. I really want to use mast because of the possibility of shrinking the small amount of glandular tissue the surgeon left in, but my source of choice only has mast p and i fucking hate pinning, plus it would be expensive as hell to get any meaningful amount. A good dose of mast p would be something like 500mg a week(please correct me if I'm wrong) and at $30 for 100mg/10ml that shit would get costly real fast. What should I do? What do you think an appropriate cruise dose would be? Been blasting 500mg/wk test c with 7.5mg LGD daily. Was planning on dropping the test to 100-200/wk, stick with the LGD and add something non aromatizing(or very little aromatization) to finish leaning out. I'm not opposed to running an oral but I've beaten the shit out of my liver over the years from all sorts of shit and would like to avoid any liver metabolization, if possible.

We generally use Polycom phones, but have tested a wide variety and didn't have any issues when using standard codecs.

Asterisk also has support for further video functionality like video voicemail, video IVRs (which is pretty useless but cool nonetheless), and video conferencing. Pretty much anything that uses voice can also use video. Keep in mind it's pass-through support only, no transcoding as far as I'm aware.

"SideProject","t5_2w2vn","Holy shit this is clever, and finally. As context for other users: this app accepts artist, song name, albums, and Spotify playlists as input (some require pairing-- e.g. just a song name won't work).

It then uses Spotify APIs to find the music and tag information, and YouTube to download copies of it. 

(I take it that it ONLY downloads the audio portion, correct? I seem to remember that that youtube-dl has to recombine both portions into an mkv for high quality.)

I don't pirate, but I do, for example, have (or had-- it was stolen), an old iPod classic with music from an iTunes account I don't remember the email to, and rebuilding that collection the ordinary way (through a torrent or otherwise) is completely tedious. 

I don't feel that acquiring music that I've previously purchased is stealing, no matter the format, as long as I'm not pulling in value add works (say, a remaster) in place of the original. 

A program to reliably and automatically find, download, and properly tag music is a complete first so far as I know. Everything else is either a means for obtaining the music, or a means to automatically tag it, which is a pain to do separately. As well, when using YouTube as a source, the odds are even obscure music is covered is excellent.

I think at the end of the day, something like taking one's life proves how purposeless and arbitrary all of these self-imposed conventions in society are. That's a tragic thing to discover for someone who might have a bit more emotional investment in these conventions. That's probably why it's so hard to form relationships now. When my best friend killed himself at a young age, I was disrupted in a very similar way; I began to look at life as fleeting and meaningless. My relationships with people therefore became meaningless. This disruption can present an opportunity for either nihilism or some sort of philosophical nuance.

"dryalcoholics","t5_39pn6","Today marks two weeks without being drunk. I inexplicably was able to have a few beers several times in social contexts without going off the rails. Tuesday was my last drink -- went out to the bar with my ex-gf and only had two beers. 

I'm still cripplingly depressed and struggle to motivate myself to get out of bed, eat, etc. Still missing my ex-gf like hell. I started this attempt at sobriety to impress her, but it seems like a case of too little too late. She's gone off and started banging some normie who's into normal stuff like football and call of duty.

As I mentioned in a previous post, exercise is the only thing keeping me sane. I've been working out immediately after waking, then just bumbling around the rest of the day, pretending to be productive and waiting to exercise again. I've lost 10lbs in five weeks which doesn't seem like it should be possible, but I'll take my victories where I can find then.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p"," no, that is stupid. You are implying that physical processes cannot produce consciousness. In point of fact, physical processes are the only things which have ever been shown to be able to produce consciousness.",1493596842
"environment","t5_2qh1n","The simplest explanation starts with behavioral economics.  I don't know if you are familiar with the topic - so let us try an analogy.

Let's assume we have a rich person.  Really rich.  Like he or she has $100 Million dollars in the bank.  They're living in an apartment and paying rent of $2,000 a month.  A year goes by and the landlord says he is raising the rent to $5,000 a month.  Does the landlord's change in the rent require that person to leave the apartment?  No.  There is $100 million in the bank and the $36,000 extra each year doesn't materially impact the tenant's wealth.  He or she could comfortably keep living in the apartment.

Let's say instead that person earns $50,000 and has little to no savings - that's the median household income in some places around the country and lots don't have much in savings.  Same facts.  Landlord raises the rent to $5,000 a month.  Now the rent costs $60,000 and is more than the person earns in a year.  Is the person likely to move?  Absolutely 100%

You can see from the example that the difference in finances *can lead to different behavior* between the two people.  The poorer person has a 100% chance of changed behavior.  The richer person does not have a 100% chance of changed behavior - they can *afford* to stay.  

So, if you keep the fine as $20 million - because the crime itself is all that matters independent of the party who commits it, then you have had money change hands - but you can't guarantee that you change behavior in the same way.  The rent increase for the rich person in the example is a ""cost of doing business"" whereas the rent increase for the poor person is prohibitive.  So, keeping the rent the same doesn't guarantee the same fair result between tenants.  Nor does it result in the same behavior.

Now let's assume the landlord REALLY WANTS THE TENANT TO GET OUT.  But doesn't want to say so.  To make the rich person leave the apartment, the landlord would almost certainly have to raise the rent MUCH higher to get the same behavior.  

See how there are different parts of criminal/civil penalties to consider?  Whether you want to just get some money to change hands or you want to get the result you want by changing behavior?

So the question is: why do we have laws?  Do we want the rich to be able to just pay the fines and break the laws as much as they can afford?  What if MURDER could be a crime with a financial penalty.  $1,000,000 for murdering someone.  The rich could go on murdering people and paying the fee because they derive greater satisfaction out of murder than the money.  The poor could not murder people because they couldn't afford to pay the fee.  Would you really want a society where the rule was: same crime same punishment for murder if money was the measure?  What if criminal and civil penalties were really designed to make it so people didn't commit crimes/infractions?  How would you have to structure the law to achieve that goal.  Is it different?  Sometimes yes.

"roguelikes","t5_2rhpi","I think comparing to any one specific game is bound to cause problems either way; finding the 'epitome' of roguelikes wouldn't help much even if we agreed. It'd be better to look at multiple games, but break them down into their most *important* elements rather than their most *common* ones. Then if we did use some kind of a rating system, it could be a *weighted* system with more points assigned to important elements and less points for less important elements (for example, permadeath could be worth 5 points while ascii display is only worth 1).

This would still be tricky, though, as we'd have to come to a general consensus about which elements are actually important and which ones are not-so-important (taking my previous statement as an example, our opinions about procgen'd environments might be wildly different). And even between games, there are some elements that are very important for some but very bad for others; giving character levels to Brogue would, I feel, probably make the game much *worse*, while taking them away from ToME would be a horrible idea! There's not really a good way to decide how important character levels are on their own, and that's just one element out of many.

I kind of feel like there are two different branches of traditional roguelike: those that focus on short-term tactical combat decisions (such as Brogue and Cogmind), and those that focus on long-term strategic character development decisions (such as ADOM and ToME). In a weighted rating system, should the value of these elements change depending on whether the game in question is more tactical or more strategic? What about games like DCSS that try to skirt the line between both? Do the 'gray area' games occupy so much of the genre as to make a weighted rating system not worth the time and effort it'd take to make? Not easy questions to answer, in any case...",1493596843

"stunfisk","t5_2sn6d","I was using Mimi-P2-Magnezone-Mudsdale-Snorlax-Hariyama (i.e. Gavin's team, but with Mudsdale over Araquanid).

I went 14-4, ended a little over 1,650, which I'm perfectly content with. 3 of the 4 losses were very clearly down to misplays on my end, with the last being a close game decided by a string of bad luck. My losses were disproportionately against weird stuff, so I probably need to re-evaluate how I respond to unconventional pokemon. I found opponents were generally under-prepared for hard Trick Room, and so in several games there was a very simple path to victory after the first few turns.

Lele was incredibly common, forcing me to bring Mimikyu more than I normally like. However too many Leles stayed in on the Z-Shadow Claw which baffled me - I thought more people would recognise the set from team preview. The games helped me realise that with this team it's not always best to go for Trick Room as soon as you can - there are times when dangling the threat of Trick Room can force your opponent to over-extend and get punished. Magnezone is particularly good at doing that IMO.

I'm slowly getting better at using Snorlax, but for some reason it's taken me a while to figure out when to set up, when I can switch in etc.

Having Mudsdale over Araquanid was definitely a big help. I'd been finding Araquanid had just become too awkward on Showdown (thanks especially to the surge in Gigalith usage). It does make the team a little too dependent on Snorlax or Magnezone to actually KO Tapu Fini, but High Horsepower spam won me a couple of games. The 50% berry didn't activate all that much (partly because I kept using Mudsdale against Muk); the most notable activation was when it allowed me to survive another Ninetales Freeze-Dry, only to get frozen for a second time.

I'm presuming it was only because I didn't ladder high enough, but I didn't face any opposing Snorlax, which made things a great deal simpler.

"FATErpg","t5_2toez","I gotta admit, I'm not really into the idea of players getting two characters each; Fate tends to shine brightest when players have built up the relationships between the PCs (and especially when those relationships have aspects to emphasize them). Doubling the number of characters will dilute that. Furthermore, since Fate characters are meant to be generally competent and heroic, it's not usually important to have specialists for a given mission, so unless you're doing some tweaking to make party composition more of an issue, the choice of who to take on a mission would be fairly arbitrary. This isn't to say it's inherently a bad idea, and there are some settings (such as Good Neighbors) that give players multiple characters. But in this case it's not clear to me what having multiple characters adds to the game, to justify the increased complexity.

On the other hand, giving the rebellion and empire character sheets is a good idea, a perfect example of using the Fate fractal. I'd suggest not overloading them with aspects or stunts at first (you'll usually find that there are a lot of aspects to try and keep in your head even if you're playing perfectly vanilla), but like two aspects and a ""once per session this faction can do a Surprising And Awesome Thing""-style stunt will do a lot to give personality to the rebellion and Empire as organizations.",1493596844

It was in the mid 80's (I'm old), and I happened by an NAACP convention on C-SPAN.

If that person can get by on 90% of our money, then you should be able to as well. You can learn to cook, a little bit at a time, and eat for a couple dollars a day. You can find a slightly smaller place to live, or get roomates, or use a flip phone instead of a smart phone, get rid of cable.

"starwarsrebels","t5_2xavr","Although they didn't directly say it, I felt the whole episode was building towards her backstory.  We see that she is reluctant to return to Mandalore; Kanan even says this.  And that question is riddled throughout the episode: why?  That ending monologue is when we find out her true past.  I think it makes sense.  After being angry and walking away to be with her thoughts, I think she'd be ready to share her story (after some taunting).

The monologue came after 1. she walked away and talked to Ezra about family 2. Kanan spoke to Hera about training. After these two primary characters are told advice, they face each other again.  I think it built very well in that regard.

While I partially agree the dialogue to the monologue was a bit shaky, I love the monologue.  I personally get chills every time I watch it.  I think this is primary the music.  ""Sabine Suite"" by Kevin Kiner is one of my favorite pieces.  I just love the delivery and music.  It brings a new depth to Sabine.

I also somewhat agree that Sabine has a lot of stuff in her past, but it's been established that she was a good weapons mechanic already, and drawing is just something she does on her free time.  Overall, I adore this episode and I think it has great atmosphere/music/character development.  But opinions make the world go round!",1493596849

"restaurateur","t5_2u6u9","I've run an ice cream store for 7 years now. Two thirds of your sales will happen after 6 pm. Two thirds will be between Friday and Sunday, and two thirds will be between spring and summer. So basically all your profit is made on weekends after 6 pm during the spring and summer. All of the rest of the time you are open may or may not be profitable at all. If your lease lets you be closed during the winter, that can be a significant benefit. Because of the limited amount of revenue you'll want COGS and Labor to be lower than a traditional food service operation. 25% labor and 25% COGS can work, but if you can get it even lower, the better. If you are going to be the first scoop shop of this brand, then you'll have to spend on advertising, because they certainly aren't going to come in from brand awareness. In fact, the supplier should really be doing that brand advertising since they are the ones who own the brand and the goodwill that will be attached to it if you succeed. If I were you, I'd require them to spend a certain amount in advertising as a condition of you selling their product. There is also the risk of minimum wage rising soon. Hand dipped shops require a lot of minimum wage scoopers, and I predict that when minimum wage does increase, a lot of scoop shops are going to go out of business because of the increase labor costs. In a nutshell, it seems like an easy business, but because you are dealing with such a limited time frame of when people want your product, the low cost they expect to pay, and the labor involved especially when they all come in at once, it's actually a very difficult businesses to succeed at. Don't think for a second that you can just hire a manager to run it, so you can be an absentee owner. Succeeding at owning an ice cream store is an owner/operator endeavor. ",1493596851

I like this ED a lot. I probably won't do a music corner for it because it doesn't connect to anything specific, but its lyrics are a really good summary of what Monogatari is about as a whole. Empathy, fear, love, and the convergence of all those emotions when you bare your soul to another person and make a genuine human connection.

""The ace is worth half of Seixas Pereira/six ____ "" so perhaps it indicates that Mr. Pereira is even better than the ace of hearts?  Not sure, don't really get it.

"communism101","t5_2uc81","&gt; people want and declare their demand for X Y Z. group 

Not necessarily. I mean, that will happen obviously, but the way I take it is that there will be a committee specially picked out to calculate the demand through scientific evidence. 

&gt; group A people be like 'ok i can make x' other group b be like 'i can make y', and group C for Z. So they go and keep making it

Yup, but in a more colossal sense. We're talking about factories, vertical farms, automated machineries, etc. And just to add to that, ""they go and keep making it according to the plan devised""

&gt; SO people are here making X, and X doesn't need more people anymore, or demand for X fell, so people who work for X stop working for X and go to Y

That depends. Can the people who work for industry X work in industry Y? Does industry Y need more laborers or less? Again, it all depends on the common plan. 

&gt; Until all work can at all times be perfectly done by machines and no one gives a shit anymore unless they want to bring new inventions to the world and maintain those for fun or necessity

Personally, I don't believe that machines can fully take over labor to the point where we won't have to care anymore. We'd still need to take care of those machines somehow, we'd still need to account for damage and whatnot. I think we can automate society to a point where human labor would be significantly lowered. But who knows. 

&gt; People can pick up whatever job they like, be it menial shit like janitor or be an engineer. I suppose currently the respect that engineers have over janitors is that the capitalist machine can use them better in production. Whereas janitors are dealing with secondary tasks in the capitalist economy of cleaning up offices and shit

Basically, yeah. 

I will have to tell you though that most of what we can say about communism is mostly speculation, not necessarily 100% accurate. We can only guess based on what we perceive now as practical since society has never reached communism. Society has reached socialism in many areas but that's as far as we get. We'd need the whole of society to be socialist to begin transforming into communism and currently, there aren't any socialist countries anymore. There are socialist revolutions headed by a communist party, both in India, the Philippines, Turkey, etc., and the Philippine one is the most advanced revolution currently, but yeah. ",1493596857

Which I guess in isolation is fine, but then at the same time, they provide endless excuses for the Raps (see above In this whole string of comments): ""we dropped the lead but we came back"", ""we got stomped but we won the series"", etc. 

I just find it funny that people are critiquing the Cavs for not blowing out their opponents, while forgetting that we got blown out once in our series and also let huge leads slip away in multiple games. So what does that say about us?

And I do acknowledge that Bucks and Pacers aren't the same level of team, but our 6 game series against the Bucks wasn't any more confidence-inspiring than their sweep of the Pacers.  ",1493596857
"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","Having maintenance issues isn't an exceptional circumstance. Exceptional circumstances is a bad title, because it makes it seem like the balance of responsibility lies on your side.

It's not. If the airline did anything less than taking all reasonable steps to prevent the delay, they're responsible. Previous court cases have shown that in the case of maintenance issues, unless it's an inherent design flaw that was previously unknown, or some really bizarre scenario like that, they have to pay up.

They should have had another plane on standby. They chose not to probably for financial reasons. It would have been reasonable to. So they didn't take all reasonable steps to prevent the delay.

Take it all the way. Ryanair and the budget airlines are known for rejecting you flat out, even when you have a good case.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Maybe you need to put off moving in together for a while. Combining finances to any degree requires a lot of trust, and while many couples are ready at this point others need more time. 

In terms of your solutions, yes your position on financial management is reasonable. Splitting things proportionately and using a joint account asking with individual accounts are common ways to combine finances and they're widely seen as fair. That doesn't mean they're the only fair way to do things. Some couples prefer to split things 50/50 anyway. Some keep completely separate accounts even after marriage.

I think it is truly important to try not to take differences of opinion personally. It seems like you're hearing his view and interpreting it as ""he doesn't trust me."" Instead, try to ""ascribe the best intentions consistent with the evidence."" Considering self preservation is important for everyone, balanced with trust. And maybe try having a discussion where you don't try to convince the other of anything, but simply thoroughly share your own view and listen to the other's view. (Look up the Speaker Liatener technique for a potential format.) The goal should be only to fully understand not to prove or come to a decision. What are the financial values he considers important? And you? How do you each think a married couple should handle finances? An engaged couple? A dating couple? I wonder if part of this is if you're simply moving too fast for him.",1493596858

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","I think your feelings are valid, BUT I'd really caution you not to put all of your ""emotional eggs"" into that basket, because when your relationship is on the rocks (as they inevitably will at times) it will rock you way too hard. My husband is sometimes the only reason that I stick around, BUT when I was in the middle of a PTSD drunken episode recently I was literally saying goodbye to him. Which I never would have imagined happening even just a year ago. My aunt went through with her suicide and had a son who was about to get married and two more kids and a husband and parents and brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews who LOVED her to pieces and she still did it. You have to have a will within yourself, I think. It makes a difference to know that people care, but it's also a bit dangerous I think to rely completely on that. It's also not realistic to expect another human to reliably be a perfect support system. Sometimes it almost feels like it just adds an extra layer of guilt when the suicidal feelings happen because I know how hurt they would feel by it. When my husband is in a bad place it sometimes even makes me worse. It's not his fault, he's human and allowed to have bad days, but I just want to give you some perspective. All of that said, relationships are absolutely rewarding in many other ways. Please stick around to give yourself that chance to experience that!",1493596863

SNIP

&gt; The findings are significant for a Democratic Party, at a historic low point, that's trying to figure out how it can win back power. Much of the debate over how to proceed has centered on whether the party should try to win back working-class white voters — who make up most of the Obama-Trump voters — or focus instead on mobilizing its base.

&gt; **Turning out the base is not good enough, the data suggest.**

&gt; ""This idea that Democrats can somehow ignore this constituency and just turn out more of our voters, the math doesn't work,"" Canter said. ""We have to do both.""

And then, of course, Third Way has to weigh in:

&gt; ""There's an active conversation within the party about whether persuasion was the problem or turnout,"" said Lanae Erickson Hatalsky, vice president for social policy and politics at Third Way, a center-left Democratic think tank.

&gt; That debate is complicated because some Democrats think winning over voters is already a lost cause, Hatalsky said.

&gt; ""There's still a real concern that persuasion is harder and costs more than mobilization, so let's just triple down on getting out the people who already agree with us,"" she said. ""And I think there's a lot of worry that we don't actually know how to persuade anymore, and so maybe we should just go talk to the people we agree with.""

I'm sure *everybody* wants to be a member of a political party that shies away from doing anything *hard.*

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","What made him so special boxing wise? I would say first and foremost his defense and counter punching ability. Both were excellent. 

His chin? Good but not great.  Mosely hit him with a decent overhand right that had Mayweather holding on. His defense was so good that this wasn't much of a problem. 

His power? Despite only recording 11 KO's in his last 30 fights, he had adequate power. Enough to get your attention at least. I suspect a big reason why he didn't score more KO's was due to his defensive approach to the sport. Perhaps he would have scored more had he been more offensive minded. Perhaps he would have been stopped had he been more offensive minded. 

Speed and quickness? Very good. Nowhere near someone like Roy Jones Jr. (Montell Griffin spared with Mayweather and fought Roy, and said it wasn't even close. Roy was much faster ), but who is? 

Longevity? Very good. He fought for 19 years  (which includes a couple of sabbaticals, one of which was forced ), and maintained a very high level. This has certainly been matched and exceeded by some fighters  (Jones Jr., Hopkins, Klitschko, Mosely, etc.) This is certainly a testament to the care he took of himself. 

Opponents? In terms of names, there's no doubt that the list is impressive. A lot of people would argue that a lot of those opponents should have asterisks because of when he fought them.

Where does he rank all time? That'sn purely subjective. It depends on what you think deserves weight and what doesn't. If I were to try and break that down, this post would increase 5 fold.

Landlords abuse tenants in signing asking for key deposits (which are illegal) and no pet clauses (which are unenforceable).

As a landlord I'd like to see more protections for landlords, tenants have too many rights; it takes about 6-8 weeks to kick out a tenant who doesn't pay rent, which is unfair to someone who has a mortgage/taxes/insurance to pay. I've seen my fair share of horrible tenants but I've also seen many many more perfect tenants.

But the lease agreements that we use as agents are pretty standard with clauses added in. I don't see how there wouldn't be a clauses section in the new standardized lease",1493596865

The only recent champion design talks they've done, that I could find, were ""The 'Sexy' Factor"" in which they're talking about how the character look needs to fit the character archetype, as well as one that Greg Street did in Sept. 2016 that I think might piss off a lot of people in this thread - and he said as follows:

""Having a game with space dragons, robots, scarecrows, mummies, and giant bears, actually creates plenty of room for diversity. We do talk a lot about sexuality, ethnicity and gender, and what are the right decisions for individual champions or League as a whole. At the highest level, we’d love for every player out there to have a champ that they really identify with. It doesn’t seem like an unreasonable goal to have our champions be at least as diverse as our player base.""

But please, continue to gibber about how [fat people can't be even the tiniest bit athletic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg6K5-KRvtU) and how ""no matter how powerful their magic is, a champion who can't fight back physically won't fit well"" while we have [a literal child strolling around the Rift](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Annie), as well as [a sixteen year old girl](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Taliyah) who was a relatively recent release.

As for my 'mental gymnastics' - I'd actually love to change my mind on this issue, so let's go ahead and see how you'd argue against what I have to say. My favorite argument is this simple analogy:

If I hire a thug to rob you, then I guess we agree that i've violated to the NAP and you have the right use violence against me as self-defense? Now, let's say that I, John and George vote on whether we should hire thugs to rob you. I and John vote 'yes', only George votes no, so thugs get hired and you get robbed. Wouldn't you say I and John violated the NAP and you can take violent action against us to prevent us from doing the same shit again?

With the code + sale + a few memepoints it came to $79.50. It wouldn't be Memebox without an error though -- and they only sent one Benton Travel Set.  I emailed them, and they claimed they didn't have any more to send out (but they were still being advertised for sale hours later) and they would give me a refund.  When I checked the refund email, it said it was for $2.35 instead of $2.50. They reduced my refund because I used $4.50 in Memepoints on the total order.  I decided that despite it being only a few cents, it was the principle of the matter and I would question them on it.  Rather than refund me the additional 15 cents, the customer service rep is continuing to argue with me that I only paid $2.35. I tried explaining that if I only ordered one travel set to begin with, my total would have been $77.00 and the full $4.50 would have still come off the total, it wouldn't have cost me $77.15, and also that it was their error, not my decision to return the item.  In typical Memebox fashion, they will not budge.

Case in point is the Williston ND McDonald's where you can get a job for $18/hr. even if you're a terrible employee.

Second, only 3.9% of workers make minimum wage in this country, and about half of those workers are dependent teenagers. This is proof that negotiations are based on the overall job market, which is ultimately driven by supply and demand, not some arbitrary number created by the government. 

Third, no. These stores do not sell luxxotica brands. Look it up. 
 
Fourth, again your claim has no basis in truth:

&gt;A deep recession might explain an extinction-level event for large retailers. But GDP has been growing for eight straight years, gas prices are low, unemployment is under 5 percent, and the last 18 months have been quietly excellent years for wage growth, particularly for middle- and lower-income Americans.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Just over 600,000 people in Vancouver and about 2 million people in the greater Vancouver area is HARDLY too many people...

Rent and housing prices are astronomically high, and that climate mainly opens up for foreigners to purchase the expensive real estate. These people usually live elsewhere and leave these properties empty.
The city also follows an archaic visual cones rule, where they don't allow anything to block the view of the mountains. Therefore, high-rise buildings are barred from being developed, even though the city could totally benefit from mixed-use high rises to support a more dense population. Many top architects have been vocal about dropping this law.
The city has so many areas (like Jack Poole Plaza, Stanley Park, Olympic Village, beaches etc.) that could support fun events that would attract tourists to the city but they are so stringent on so many liquor laws, community laws etc. (ex. not allowed to drink at the beach in the summer?!) that it's basically a no-fun city.
In addition to all this, the city itself spends money on absolutely ridiculous/trivial things like unnecessary suicide barriers on bridges, bike lanes while things like homelessness are rampant (I'm not against bike lanes or the lifestyle change... it just doesn't make sense to REMOVE NECESSARY car lanes which create more congested traffic to make way for these. smh). All in all, Vancouver has so much potential to be one of the coolest cities in the world, given its mountains, oceans, food and ingredients, education, friendly people, healthy lifestyle, etc. but it's not as progressive as it could be because of the city's strange priorities and strange laws.

I don't recall seeing any other Ajinomoto products at Costco, but a word of caution:  They use MSG.  If you're sensitive to it, then I'd recommend not getting any of their products.

I find that Clarisonic removes makeup much better than just rubbing face cleansers and cleansing oils on my face.
You know how sometimes you cleanse and then go in with a toner and a cotton round and there's still makeup coming off on the cotton round? Doesn't happen with Clarisonic.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","Depends what you're up against really but there's somethings consistent, Treant destroys chip away damage and forces a team to siege in one go,  Arc Warden can hold a tower for an incredibly long time with 2 magnetic fields. These are more general

  To be specific if it's a hero that does the damage themself, ember spirit, tinker, natures, antimage etc. then you want a hero with pick off or thay can catch them before they escape, Spirit breaker, disruptor, Kunkka, Clockwerk and many more, a blink and a scythe with pretty much delete any split push attempts

  If the method of split push is illusion spamming then hexes and lion are the best options for this because of their ability to instakill them, OD pretty much does the same thing aswell and any hero with burst damage can usually hold back the illusions from doing any chip damage.

  The hardest case to counter, Arc Warden and Lone Druid (with aghs). Both do incredible damage to towers with little risk to the hero, zet can spam a lot more as the clone can just push till it dies while the spirit bear must be returned but at the same time the bear will push much faster if undisturbed. This is extremely rare to see even coming up to low 5k but in the case of these heroes you want to be able to find and kill the original, have a treant, or high damage again, except this time it's killing a whole hero.

  The biggest way of stopping splitpush is to have it yourself, your tier 3's aren't at risk of dying if the creeps are in the river for instance. If you have your own split push heroes then the enemies won't be able to rat buildings all too easily

In interval arithmetic, you keep track of the possible range of values for your computation instead of individual values. For example, if you know that x is in he interval [9,10] and y is in the interval [19,20], then x + y is in the interval [28,30]. Similarly, x * y is in [9*19,10*20] = [171,200].

In the case of floating point arithmetic, the input ranges for computations will typically be small (just the 1 or 2 floating point values nearest the ""true"" input to your problem) and the interval arithmetic will keep track of the worst-case roundoff error in each direction.",1493596876

"freebsd","t5_2qi1e","As many these days, I was introduced to the UNIX class of operating systems through Ubuntu. I had little computing experience at the time, but the switch from Windows caused me do dive deeper into computer science. However, the deeper I went into Ubuntu, the more I realized I didn't like it. So I went shopping for a new system.

I didn't originally choose FreeBSD for the big name features that many cite. Truth told, the system just made sense to me. The little things. And an operating system is comprised of a massive number of little things. I had tried numerous Linux distributions, but once I installed FreeBSD I have never looked back.

That said, the big name features are awesome. Linux has analogies, but these are typically NIH reimplementations of technologies from the BSD and Solaris systems. I'm positive that in a blind taste-test of the BSD solution to a problem and the Linux solution, I would wind up taking the BSD solution every time. But that's my taste, and other's mileage will vary.

At the end of the day, though, nobody should really be saying that one should or should not run FreeBSD. Those of us that build and run BSD systems do so because we want to. That is reason enough.

Install FreeBSD, OpenBSD, or NetBSD. Give it a test run. Check out the documentation. See if you like how it works. If you do, then good. If not, then that's fine.",1493596877

Some people say you should get a SSHD (hybrid hard drive) or a 7200 RPM hard drive.  But honestly it doesn't make a huge difference.  The stock hard drive is a 5400 RPM hard drive, and the PS4 is designed with a 5400 RPM hard drive in mind.

Just be aware that 2.5"" drives are the same form factor used by enterprise hard drives.  Enterprise hard drives are *extremely* expensive, and you simply don't need one on a PS4.  So stay away from them.

---

Alternatively, the PS4 now supports external hard drives.  And just about any USB 3.0 external hard drive should work.  I'd suggest grabbing one that powers externally rather than powered by the PS4 to ensure you don't run into power issues.  External drives are a great option if you don't want to have to worry about reinstalling the PS4 software and reinstalling all of your games... but... external drives obviously take up a port on your PS4 and you have to figure out where to stick the drive itself.",1493596882

Heres the thing.  Everything I say wont really feel all that great because truthfully while we've all hit that awkward rejection, a failed test, a complete failure to communicate, a job done poorly - the long and short of it is that our society tends to make us believe that never happens.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It is a fact the war ended the depression and boosted technology development.

War is one of the biggest motivators to bring new technology. WW2 drastically increased the money, motivation and political resources available for science. Two related factors that really revolutionized science was the Tizard Mission - where the UK effectively gave away all its tech secrets to the US so as to build enough weapons to counter Germany. The second one was the German scientists who were then given the resources of US and USSR after the war to build massive projects. US got to moon with a Nazi scientist. 

Space exploration
Nazi Germany originally developed the V-2 rocket to hit Britain. It was the world's first ballistic missile. After the war, US and USSR split up Germany and got a large number of these German missiles, facilities and scientists. This is how both countries got to space in the 1950s. 

Nuclear Research
The Manhattan project to develop the atom bomb was the largest ever research project until that time. The race to build the bomb produced major breakthroughs. A decade post the war, Soviet Union [again with the help of German scientists] began civilian production of electricity and two decades later it became a key energy source for the world.

Medicine
Although Fleming had invented Penicillin in 1928, it was not put to wide use. It just stayed low until war needed it. Suddenly it was produced at massive numbers and had a major change in global health. The cavity 

Air travel
Until 1940s, air travel was primarily for the adventurers. The main issue was the cabin was not pressurized leading to very high discomfort when flying high. For the war, Boeing produced B-29 that had cabin pressure and this quickly became a standard in civilian aircrafts. How Things Work: Cabin Pressure. Radars, radio navigation and a variety of things needed for modern aircraft have their origins in the war. More importantly, we now had Jet engines due to the war allowing much higher speed and range of airplanes. 

Cooking
Microwave oven really became a practicality only when cavity magnetron was invented. Someone (Percy Spencer) working at Raytheon found melting chocolate in his pocket and that became the motivation for the oven.

Computing
While computers were around for more than a century, they never got major government patronage or big use case. The need to break enigma machine provided all the resources needed to make a computer work. Without the war, introduction of computers might have been delayed by a couple of decades.

&gt; Unfortunately, one thing we agree on is that you can never predict the future, including how you or your partner will act... 

I agree but at the same time, there are things you should hopefully predict your partner won't do, lines they would never cross. Plus this particular comment is about how you two should manage your finances in the short-term future, not what would happen if you break up in 5 years.

In any case, if you limit the joint account to your shared living expenses and especially if you postpone opening it, the risks exist but they will be limited. You could keep your savings separate to protect them.

If you want to try lifting weights, that can be a bit more intimidating, but it doesn't need to be!

Not in general, he'll have insurance and the car driver's insurance company will come after them.  But let's continue despite your lack of knowledge about basic concepts involved in being legally allowed on the road.

&gt;So if that same truck is now driverless, who gets sued? The programmer(s)? The company that built the self driving system? The trucking company itself? It's a really cool idea for a driverless highway, but I can assure you that it will NEVER become an actual reality.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;There is a wage gap, but it's not because of females are being paid less.

Nobody has ever claimed that the wage gap is the result of a bunch of evil men in a boardroom laughing maniacally as they decide to pay women less. I assume that's what you're referring to here, unless this is just some bizarre doublespeak in which women both are and aren't paid less than men.

&gt; females

Why would a human with a reasonable opinion of women ever call them this?

&gt;If feminists argue that women are paid less for the same work, companies would hire mostly women for more cost-efficiency.

It's almost as if people who are in a position to consciously pay a woman less than a man don't consider their work equally valuable, and thus don't see hiring a woman as getting the same quality for less money. Or they consider women so generally incompetent that they only hire them when they blow their other applicants out the water and still try to pay them as little as possible when they do so. Your argument is essentially ""people can't be doing one irrational thing, because if they *were*, they would act with cold, robotic rationality in response to it, rather than continue to act in a generally irrational way.""

&gt;culture and career choices

Believe it or not, some people consider women being told to have a different work/life balance than men or being told high-paying careers are less feminine to be somewhat sexist.

&gt;men are more likely to negotiate better deals

Because people are more likely to agree with them when they say they deserve raises/promotions/etc, since men are still seen as having more of a responsibility to provide, and therefore more of a right to those things.",1493596886

"pie","t5_2qhui","Sure! From ""Pie"" by Ken Haedrich.

* 1 pie crust, partially pre-baked

* 1/2 cup butter, cut into pieces
* 4 oz bittersweet chocolate, coarsely chopped (I use high quality bittersweet chocolate chips; they're usually cheaper than chocolate sold specifically for baking)
* 1 1/4 cups sugar
* 2 Tbsp fine yellow cornmeal
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 3 large eggs
* 1 large egg yolk
* 1/4 cup half&amp;half cream
* 1 tsp vanilla extract

Pre-heat oven to 325.

Melt butter &amp; chocolate in a double boiler, whisk to smooth; cool briefly.

Combine sugar, cornmeal &amp; salt in a large bowl. Add eggs, egg yolk, milk &amp; vanilla. Whisk until evenly mixed. Add the chocolate mixture. Whisk until smooth. Pour into the cooled pie shell.

Bake 35-40 minutes on the center rack. Rotate 180 degrees, and bake  20-25 more minutes. The pie will often puff up during baking, and will sometimes form a very thin, crispy top crust of chocolate. To test for doneness, I give the pie a little jiggle. A little wiggle is good, but if it's at all soupy or moves in waves, it's not done yet.

Cool about 90 minutes. Store in the fridge if you're not eating it all right away :)",1493596888

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","&gt;That salary seems low, but what are the costs to go to medical school? Here the high salaries are partly justified due to the enormous debt to attend medical school?

Well, it's actually roughly the same as any other degree. There isn't even a separate ""medical school""; instead there's a ""medicine degree"", just like there are engineering degrees, history degrees, etc. 

There are some differences in that the degree lasts for 6 years (as opposed to the usual 4), is considered equivalent to a masters degree and that at the end of the degree you have to pass a test to become a doctor. (and I think then you are automatically hired in something but considered ""in training""? I have no idea about how it works exactly)

Actual costs vary depending on the region (as public university prices are set by each region), but I think it goes between 800€ a year in the cheapest regions to 2200€ a year in the most expensive ones.

Also no one takes on debt to study. If you can't pay, normally you are given a scolarship, which is automatically renewed as long as you pass at least half the subjects and your family earns less than a certain amount. Basically free tuition. If you earn even less, you are given an extra amount of money at the beginning of the year.

&gt;Also, does Spain have a dual private/public system. How does that work?

Sort of. First there's the public system. Everyone is automatically enrolled, it's paid with general taxes and it's basically free for almost everything. If you know the British NHS, basically like that, except handled at the regional level (so quality can vary depending on where you live). Almost everyone uses this.

Then there's private healthcare, apparently paid for by 18% of Spaniards. In addition to paying your general taxes to the state to support the public system, you also pay an insurance fee to a private company. In exchange there are private hospitals you can use. 

The main advantages are that it's faster (less waiting lists) and it includes stuff not included in the public system (like for example dentists). I don't think it's of higher quality though. 

Keep in mind I'm far from an expert, this is mostly from a user's point of view.",1493596893

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","Day 2:

Overal: Oberon is an energy pig, but he still has his moments that show me that it really wouldn't take much for the current rework to be tweaked to make it outstanding.

Smite: Other than how much orbs split synergy damage amongst themselves to the point of armor being able to make the secondaries all but useless at higher levels? Good idea but poor exicution. However itend to use Smite for its hard knockdown and cheap cost more than its damage.

Suggest having Smite's secondary orbs do a hard ten percent of the EHP of the primary orb target. Also have Smite give back five Energy (base) per enemy hit by orbs. This rewards Power Strength use since more strength means more orbs and each orb gathers more energy. Also ties in to the fact hallowed ground's suggestion is innate more power strength.

Hallowed Ground: On Syndicate Missions and Low Level Fissure Missions it's fine CC. ON Sortie and High Level content it's basically there as a knockdown prevention tool and mechanic for letting the rest of Oberon's kit do its thing, which adds cost to Oberon's kit as a whole. Plus since it is the center of two other abilities its range does not match either and so leaves gaps allies and enemies can fall through.

Suggestion: Give it innate Damage Reduction (Base 30% caps below what trinity can give.) Remove it doing radiation damage innately because Smite and Reckoning guarantee radiation. Instead give it a +100% power Strength and +50% efficiency for Oberon. Make it so that Oberon is ON the carpet he is casting.

Renewal: Energy hungry regardless of build, however fantastic at what it does IF you can catch team members on hallowed ground when you cast it.  The biggest problem other than its energy cost is when you don't catch allies on hallowed ground it really does feel like you're only using half the ability.

Personally I can't tell if Allies (rescue targets/structures/etc) are being healed, but I don't think they are. However Nekros's shadows of the dead are and they are a MASSIVE energy drain. No idea on if spectres heal.

Suggestion: In this order. Reduce energy cost per target. Make Iron Renewal Part of Renewal by default. Allow us to heal allies.

Reckoning: Strips a percentage of the target's current armor per cast rather than total. This kills it as an armor removal tool and makes me view that part of what it does as irrelevant. Again, I dislike that you don't get health orbs on missions you NEED health on (high level) because Reckoning can't KILL at those levels due to its low damage,  and it just plain feels unsatisfying to use since to be effective it needs to be spammed, and it's so expensive especially with renewal up I don't want to spam it except as a panic button.

Suggestion: First off have it tag enemies that you have a chance to get health orbs from if you kill them within x time (hard percentage NOT affected by any mods.) Second after making armor strip a part of reckoning to decouple it from hallowed ground, either have the armor strip work off total armor value for that enemy type/level or axe that component since if I have to spam my most expensive ability over and over again for any value it's not doing its job and doesn't have a place in my kit. Thirdly. give it back its pre-20.3 range please.

Passie: Only useful to people that bring companions. Useful to an extent, which is more than I could say about his old passive, but about all i can say is it's 'fine.'

Suggestion: Give him innate Rage and life/armor link to the rest of his team. That way oberon simply BEING there is a boost to everyone, and an innate rage plus suggestion for hallowed ground/smite can keep the paladinball rolling along murderin all that stand in the path of Glorious Tenno Conquest.

This is a baseless assertion as explained by the CBO, multiple economists, and studies that show the wealthy actually save and horde their money.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","From personal experience:

I grew up going to church and stuff but never took it seriously till I had to face some personal stuff I was going through at age 18. 
I sort of hit a point of like, just meaninglessness and not knowing what this life is all about, (things humans have been discussing for like ages). I didn't like who I was (cynical, negative, mean). I was also struggling with depression and depersonalization, which scared me lots.
So, I figured that if the God of Abraham did exist, hopefully he would help me and know what was wrong with me.
 
Long story short, i just started reading the Bible (started with 1st Peter, and reading the Psalms out loud). I discovered Jesus did indeed exist, that he is God, and that the Bible is actually his word, and that he really does love us (more than we can comprehend)! I would read the Psalms out loud in the morning and just start tearing up from joy and not know why. As I continued to pursue Jesus, he changed me (for the better), saved me, and gave me a new identity. 

Basically, in my opinion, its not ""catholic,"" ""lutheran,"" or denominations that matter but rather the heart. Its hard to explain lol but I don't think anyone can convince you that the God of Abraham is real or not. That's something you need to discover for yourself. In the words of C. S. Lewis, a former atheist,

“A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.”
(I would definitely recommend reading Mere Christianity!)

""Praise the Lord, my soul,
    and forget not all his benefits—
 who forgives all your sins
    and heals all your diseases,
 who redeems your life from the pit
    and crowns you with love and compassion,
 who satisfies your desires with good things
    so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s."" -Psalm 103: 2-5

""Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
'For who has known the mind of the Lord,
    or who has been his counselor?'
 'Or who has given a gift to him
    that he might be repaid?'
 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen."" Romans 11: 33-36

A lot of the early Cruz Records have that same kinda sound as Allroy Saves, like [Chemical People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ezrNinB5ok) 
It was all the same studio and I think Bill and Steven had a big hand in engineering. 

I love Milo Goes To College. Something about the single guitar track thats neck pickup and not too dirty is really refreshing when pretty much all mainstream punk is cranked JCM 900's on a Les Paul's bridge pickup. I remember hearing Steven Egerton saying how he found Frank's guitar sound really inspiring. All Descendents records have really cool and unique sounds. The drums on Enjoy! are lush, same with ALL. 

All - Allroy For Prez and Allroy Sez... also have a really unique production as in [EVERYTHING](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkLtRpK5RtM) is caked in reverb and there's just delay all over the place. 

[Fifteen's Liberation 7""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-mJzBx_gDM) has a very special sound. Jeff Ott's vocals sound so haunting beautiful when they're quadruple tracked. Again, a lot of Lookout! records have a similar sound being in the same studio with Kevin Army as the producer/engineer. I much prefer Swain and Choice's sound over the later Fifteen records as they have that more dry sound with the boring JCM 900 guitars. 

A lot of people shit on early Green Day records' production (and just Green Day in general) but thats because theyre comparing them with Dookie which has an almost indie rock, tame sound. [1,000 Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TGPyiOyUvA) has a truly magical sound. The way the arpeggio's reverberate and the vocals' chime together in the delay is really special in my eyes. 

[Husker Du's Zen Arcade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwOMXfkh1c8) - I love Bob's guitar sound. Even though its fuzzy solid-state, it works perfectly for his melodic guitar playing on Chattered Trips and Pink Turns To Blue. 

Any Steve Albini 'recorded' record is great: [Like Jawbreaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LcrKwcXJtgg)
The drum sound he gets is really something, I see why Nirvana went to him for In Utero. It's harsh yet still harmonic and beautiful which works great for the emotion music on 24 Hour Revenge Therapy. 

Although admittedly mostly down to the music, [Sunny Day Real Estate's first 2 LP's](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=13&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0v_u_sc3TAhUHD8AKHaQACZMQtwIIcDAM&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuWohXYfiKoQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNHhIndvy8oCHWBRJLh29stIHZsLUQ&amp;sig2=3dObNDtavPl-A3Cj1LFhHw) sound *sunny* as odd as that sound. The clean sound mixed with the raw distortion of the guitars is beautiful and the drums are so punchy. 

To contrast, [BoS - Second Coming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=daQGQjpXRrI) really show's how raw hardcore *should* be done ",1493596897

"travel","t5_2qh41","I often wear clothes without pockets, so I need a purse to carry my wallet and phone. Due to shoulder issues, I use a shoulder purse that converts into a backpack when I travel. 

If you use all that stuff in the course of a day, then it makes sense for you to carry it around. But if you rarely use those items during a full day out, it sounds like they're more ""security blanket"" items than anything else.  Maybe practice leaving out a little used item when you're at home to get used to the idea. 

I still pack too much stuff in my main bag, but I'm slowly learning to let go!  Kinda. 

Also, I admittedly have the luxury of being able to throw money at problems if need be (e.g. I can begrudgingly pay stupid high tourist stand prices for water if needed). If you don't have that luxury, packing tons of water and snacks makes sense. ",1493596897

About children, it is true that I understand children well but oftentimes I end up not liking them because children aren't all pure or good-natured as they are commonly believed to be. Children can be mean and dishonest. I sure remember when I was a child, I was at times like that. So when I find those qualities in children, my endearment sort of vanishes. 

But I am capable of finding grown-ups who have somehow managed to protect the child in them, sometimes fighting externally and internally to do so, all the while fixing their own flaws as they grew up. These people are capable of being mature and open-minded at the same time and I cherish their existence.",1493596898

"NSFWIAMA","t5_2v08j","&gt;I understand that, 

Do you? Do you *really* understand that?

&gt;but that occurred after someone got caught with the video. 

Usually for an unrelated charge. Not accounting those who download such content thinking they're 100% off radar only to find out they're not.

&gt;What I'm asking is, ""I do everything I can to make sure I'm not caught with the video, so given that, how can it affect anyone else but me?""

What does this have to do with you? The fact that no matter how careful you are you'll eventually slip up like your kind tends to do. You may think you're getting away with this 100% but in reality you're not getting away with anything. It's just a matter of time before you're left wondering ""But how did I get caught?""


&gt;Again, I don't download stuff from forums or sites, and I do everything to make sure it can't be traced to me or recorded -- by cops or by the creators -- so I ask again, ""how could anyone know?""


Well you're getting your **""entertainment""** from somewhere so either you're making it yourself or you're lying. I'm willing to bet a year's wages it's both.


&gt;I'm not bragging, 

That's absolute bullshit and you know it.

&gt;I'm pointing out that I do everything I can to be safe and make sure no one knows what I'm watching. If no one knows, then the creators can't know, so I'm not promoting more creation. I'm pointing out that I do what I do to make sure that it's not hurting anyone because it doesn't promote anything if no one knows about it. 


Despite the fact that you have legal options that you can use to get your rocks off guilt free. You choose something that is illegally and rightfully so.

&gt;It's not bragging to want others to be safe.

You want others to be safe? 


&gt;When I say ""I make sure I can't get caught"", I'm not bragging about how smart I think I am; 

That's exactly what you're doing.

&gt;I'm telling you that I don't want anyone to get hurt, 

As if you actually care.

&gt;so I do everything in my power to ensure no one can ever know what I watch.

Like I said. That only goes so far.


&gt;Why? Is there some connection in your mind between computer science and pedophilia? 

No you moron. The fact that you have a degree in computer science. Guess they really are just giving degrees away to anyone these days.

&gt;Because I only mentioned it to point out that I know what I'm doing when it comes to cyber security and making sure no one knows what I watch.

Yeah I know **why** you said all of that.


&gt;And I am careful--not scare-quotes ""careful""--because I don't want people to get hurt just because of me. 

By people you mean you.

&gt;It's not about bragging, it's about empathy.

If this is how you express empathy then you have bigger problems.


&gt;Would you prefer I told you, ""Hey, I don't really know what I'm doing, but I don't think the creators know I'm downloading stuff. If they do, oh well""? 

No. Though you assume they don't take measures to see who's downloading content on the DL.

&gt;Is that what you would rather the case be instead of me ensuring they can't know and thus don't make more because of me?


Just because you're barely less of a scumbag than those who make and upload content doesn't make you saint. 


&gt;I do feel guilty. 

Not really. 

&gt;Never said anything about crying; that's in your imagination.


You missed the part about insinuation. 


&gt;and so I have to keep reiterating why it won't.


If you actually cared about children you wouldn't watch child porn. You would instead find something you could watch hat would be enough for your needs while avoiding doing something like what you're currently involved in.


&gt;""Your kind""? 

Mmm-hmm. You're not some poor struggling pedophile who suffers from guilt. If you were you'd use your skills to find a legal method(or create one) for your urges but you actively choose not to do so. Yet you post here acting like you're some great human being that's trying to do the right thing when in fact you're nowhere near close to the person you're trying to portray yourself as. 


&gt;That's what I'm doing here, not trying to gain trust so I can secretly move in and rape a kid while you watch.

Who's to say you want do something like that and try to justify it like you're justifying your use of CP?


&gt;It's clear you're not talking about me anymore, just your general idea of what a monster all pedophiles are.

I didn't mean all. Just the majority. 


&gt;Your idea of me is based entirely on the word ""pedophile"" and the phrase ""child porn"", ignoring everything else I've said in this thread and anything else you don't even know about me.


Nope just going by your words. And like I said I'm quite good at seeing through the façade pedophiles will often put on. It also means I can weed out the genuine ones from those who want to act like they're some poor oppressed class who's bad actions aren't ever their fault. 

&gt;Once again, you're talking about your idealized pedophile, not me.

Idealized? Nope. Blunt? Definitely.


&gt;And if so, then I'll get caught and be off the street, maybe killed, and you can be happy about that.

If you get caught you only have yourself to blame.


&gt;In either case, you should be happy.

Pedophiles don't make me happy. There's maybe two that I've spoken that didn't outright make my skin crawl or make me feel nauseous. I was wary of them after first but so far it was clear they weren't putting on a show. Even though my only contact with them was online and not in person. I'd rather not interact with a pedophile in person ever again.

&gt;You sure I'm not a necrophiliac?

Oh ffs. If you are that's much worse. But you don't seem like one.


&gt;And for the last time, why the hell does ""I make sure I'm safe so that others can be safe"" sound like bragging to you?

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","This my gaming group's most played game. We absolutely love it. BUT... We do play it heavily house ruled; with not placing the noise tokens on the board and taking turns in any order being the two most important changes we make. We also have LOTS of zombies so extra activations due to lack of zombies never occur.

The sweet spot is prison break combined with toxic city mall and using zombie dogs. The combination of original zombie, toxic, berserk and dogs makes it the most enjoyable for us.

We all felt season 3 was awful. We didn't like the new zombie types and the spawn changes were woeful. 

Black plague is played occasionally but we prefer the modern setting. The targeting priority rules from black plague are much better than survivor is always hit first, but we never had an issue with that rule in the original, unlike a lot of people. 

We are also terrible cooperative players, we argue (all in good fun) about what we should do, we keep the best weapons for ourselves even if our character can't maximize the potential from it (everyone wants that chainsaw!) and we will happily leave others to die if survival of all isn't needed to win a scenario.

We have created ourselves as characters, designed scenarios based around where we live and created hilarious moments that we can look back on and laugh about. It's very much a mini sandbox that you can tailor to suit the way you want to play. We curse the dice gods when things don't go our way and we have cheered at stupid plans that came to fruition because of those same dice.

It's simple enough to teach anyone in 2 minutes, it doesn't really have any strategy or depth, but it's fun. I'm yet to introduce it to someone who hasn't enjoyed playing it with us. ",1493596900

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","You are probably in their territory. They may have been fed prior, and now they expect that from you.

Also, crows have good memories, perhaps you have accidentally done something they perceived as threatening and now they are aggressive towards you. 


At least one of those pics has a juvenile crow so this could just be them being protective and it will calm down in a few months.

It may sound crazy but if you read a lot about bird behaviour you'll see reports of crows holding grudges for years. One of my favourites is about a kid that would throw stones at the crows in his yard and they started to swoop him and follow him around. Years later when he moved nearby, they followed him and continued with the behaviour.

To make that even crazier, it may not have been the same group. It's believed they can communicate to other crows ""good"" or ""bad"" people.



On the other side of the coin, perhaps there's a history of people in the past feeding them. When my crows, kookas and magpies come, they wait at the door or the window sills watching intently and waiting for the fridge to open and then they scatter to feeding positions.

Either way, as many have said just give them a feed and maybe you'll have friends instead of foes!

I do agree that it it is a ton of information that has to be soaked up by the student very quickly. The thing is that with every block (""blocks"" are several weeks of courses focused on one organ system) we get lots of review on histo, physio, path, and anatomy, so it's not a learn-once-and-forget system. We learn a lot by studying cases that exemplify the organ system were currently studying, thus have to integrate all the subject matter we've learned. At the end of year 2, we take a huge exam that covers all topics from years 1&amp;2. Also, here in the States vet students get around 2 years of heavily supervised/mentored years of clinical cases while still students, which is the second half of our 4 year degree. I'd say almost all US vet students have a bachelor's/undergraduate degree, but it could be in any field as long as certain science and math prerequisites are fulfilled.

I've known both male and female Jewish people that have married outside of the religion. Unless you are only talking about only the older, orthodox sects.

Perhaps talk to David's mother.  She might open whole new doors about your mother, that gives you a whole new insight.

Anyhow, instead of getting all wound up about what I think, once again, I am going to make the suggestion that you talk to /r/legaladvice.  He might get the closure that he needs, and you both might learn that he isn't owed any standard of living or inheritance, by birthright.

They can also tell you if you can force a DNA test on your brother's paternal grandmother, perhaps by subpoena, at an accredited lab or something.

But when I make a good suggestion, and you keep going on whining about things that aren't relevant, it makes me think you just don't have better things to do, and I do have better things to do.

So either go talk to legal advice, or go watch tv or something.  But one more bit of whining out of you, I am going to ban you.  Just to not have to listen to it any more.

"OldSchoolCool","t5_2tycb","Sapper Reginald A. Stevenson (with the fuse cord around his neck) and L/Cpl. Raymond C. Mace, 2 members of the 2/13 Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, exhausted after the initial attempt to get ashore and blow wire defences at Lingkas, on the Island of Tarakan which is off the east coast of Borneo. 30th April 1945.

The primary objective for the Allied attack on Tarakan (code-named ""Oboe One"") was to secure and develop the island's airstrip so that it could be used to provide air cover for subsequent landings in Brunei, Labuan and Balikpapan. The secondary objective for the operation was to secure Tarakan's oilfields and bring them into operation as a source of oil for the Allied forces in the theatre.

The task of clearing the beach obstacles at Lingkas was assigned to the 2/13th Field Company. These defences comprised rows of barbed wire, wooden posts and steel rails which extended 125 yards from the beach. At 11:00 on 30 April, eight parties of engineers went forward in LVTs and landing craft to clear the obstacles. The engineers were supported by the guns on Sadau Island and Allied warships and aircraft. Operating under Japanese fire the engineers cleared all the obstacles obstructing the landing beaches. While heavy casualties had been expected, the 2/13th completed their task without loss.

Military Medal award: 'Lance-Corporal Mace was the non-commissioned officer in command of a demolition team engaged in the breaching of underwater beach obstacles on Tarakan. Despite the intermittent fire of the enemy the working party coolly kept on and completed and sign-posted the gap in thirty five minutes. Lance-Corporal Mace then withdrew his party and went to the rescue of another party who were hampered by the depth of the mud. He attempted to carry a line to secure one of the obstacles to enable the Section to drag themselves to the proposed gap but sank in the mud and had to be dragged back. He then took his L.V.T. to the oil pier and led his party to the beach and attacked the obstacles from the shore side with success. Lance-Corporal Mace's personal endurance, courage and leadership were wholly responsible for the effective completion of the two gaps'.

They conveniently omit any atrocities stated or actioned by religions over the years.   
They also conveniently omit thousands of religions that do not meet their narrative, a good example is the Sumerian mythology which influenced Judaism, Christianity and Islam.   
They claim to be religious historians and they compare all religions to come up with a unified religion, but its all empty claims.

"grilledcheese","t5_2qyw8","A grilled cheese consists of only these following items. Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire subreddit consist of ""melts"". Almost every ""grilled cheese"" sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this subreddit is called ""grilledcheese"" is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. 

Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It's called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don't know what the hell you'd call that but it's not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I've eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. 

But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled ""melts"" because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I'm not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. 

Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I've seen post after post of peoples ""grilled cheeses"" all over reddit and it's been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own subreddit just because I know this one exists now.

You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is. Or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is. A melt.",1493596905
"drones","t5_2rudk","Having whizz bang avoidance sensors might be advanced, but it isn't multipurpose.

I don't think the question is a good one. Are we looking at whizz bang features, versatility of mission, areas of operation, etc. Inspire seemed to tick lots of boxes in easy payload swap, portability, operating conditions, pricing, availability and payload information displayed on-screen (my understanding was that you could see the thermal info while operating)

""Multipurpose"" meaning what? Is hour long surveillance flight a significantly different purpose to what a Mavic/Phantom could do with a 20 minute flight? Is being able to fly more than 400m of elevation from your takeoff point (e.g. in mountain ranges, or airspace that allows it) a different enough purpose to regular flight? Is being able to look up and down a different enough requirement to move it from ""flying and taking pictures""?
Is flying for film one day, and a thermal inspection the next ""different purpose"" or both just taking pictures?
Does it need long endurance and VTOL? Or sealed and able to fly in rain or submerge in water like an H2O hex?
In cinema drones, flying small spaces an Inspire (or Phantom, or Solo, etc) fit through is a different role to a heavy lifter, and amongst those, no doubt having the gimbal for a RED vs Arri or something else might count as important enough to be a different purpose.
Is centimetre precision from RTK a purpose, and would it be important enough to differ from PPK?

"btc","t5_2si5v","Look dude. I'm levelling with you here. You say you want a blocksize increase but don't like BU's proposal? BU isn't even proposing an increase themselves. It's a modification to the Core client that allows the client to accept and relay blocks larger than 1 MB, *should there be any that are broadcast* by miners. It's still up to the miners and community at large to determine that. And that's where the decision SHOULD be, NOT in the hands of a few core devs who claim to know best. THAT is the point of the divide between r/BTC and r/Bitcoin. 

Lastly I leave you with this. Despite their words (and oh how many words there have been), the actions of Core have shown zilch in terms of actually increasing the base blocksize. Full stop. Segwit is not a blocksize increase. Neither are schnorr Sig's, LN, or any other bullshit. A promise was made (Hong Kong agreement) and a promise was broken. 

So really, I (and many others) don't care one whit about what each core devs latest BIP or tweet says. They've had their chances to lead, and squandered them. Bitcoin is moving forward without that team, and is all the better for it. How can you observe their shifting narratives and ugly tactics and take them seriously still? Take a look around at the unhappy people here in this sub. Are they really all Roger Ver shills? Just out to get Blockstream? ""Blocking progress""? Or do they all just want a fucking base blocksize increase like Core said we would get YEARS ago and has done nothing but beat around the bush and chase other improvements instead? Bundling this with that, claiming this really meant that, and ending with SegWit was the blocksize increase they intended all along???? 

Fuck that noise. Crypto was not designed to be dependent on a single Dev team, and if one dev team won't adhere to the desires of the community, then crypto moves past them, either via another team or via it's death and replacement by a competitor crypto. Since I don't want BTC to die, I choose to listen to other dev teams and run a client that lets ME choose what size blocks to accept and relay. ",1493596906

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","You do realize that ~3% of the Soviet enlisted troops were women, right? The Soviets threw everything at the Germans, including not only the kitchen sink but even the bolts holding it in the kitchen. Yea, the women were *mostly* second line troops, but they were in combat roles and being 'behind' the front line only meant you were going to be in the front line soon enough. Not to mention that any AA unit that was overrun or had to hold their ground in the face of a ground advance had a very good chance of being mostly women. 

If there's an Eastern front in the game, women being involved in combat could be slotted in. Especially if Stalingrad makes an appearance. 

Otherwise though, I've read that Germany used a lot of women in reserve forces, which inevitably were thrown at the Soviets towards the end. I never looked into enough to get hard numbers though. 

Next, if there's any levels pretty much *anywhere* in WWII involving a breakthrough, women could plausibly show up. They were used quite often behind the front lines in support roles (where as the Soviets had them explicitly in *combat* roles) by pretty much every major power, except the US (which I'm not actually *sure* about, and I'm too lazy to check).

So I suppose if you don't have *any* of those scenario's, then sure, it's ahistorical to show women in combat. Personally, I'd be excited to see women pop up in CoD because you're fighting in Stalingrad or making the final push to end Germany.

&gt; On his downfall from Heaven to Hell, Lucifer passes through the earthly paradise, a village in Mexico, where elderly Lupita and her granddaughter Maria live. Lupita's brother Emanuel pretends he's paralyzed so he can drink and gamble while the two women tend to the sheep. Lucifer senses an opportunity and plays the miraculous healer. He forces Emanuel to walk again, seduces Maria and makes Lupita doubt about her faith. He didn't bring bad luck, he only illuminated the line between good and evil, where it didn't exist before.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Japan did apologize for the atrocities they did twice but it was not really accepted and I guess they did not express them fully.
From wiki: 
&gt;The official apologies are widely viewed as inadequate or only a symbolic exchange by many of the survivors of such crimes or the families of dead victims. On October 2006, while Prime Minister Shinzo Abe expressed an apology for the damage caused by its colonial rule and aggression, more than 80 Japanese lawmakers from his ruling party LDP paid visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. Many people aggrieved by Japanese war crimes also maintain that no apology has been issued for particular acts or that the Japanese government has merely expressed ""regret"" or ""remorse"".[153] On 2 March 2007, the issue was raised again by Japanese prime minister Shinzō Abe, in which he denied that the military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. He stated, ""The fact is, there is no evidence to prove there was coercion."" Before he spoke, a group of Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers also sought to revise the Kono Statement.[9][14] This provoked negative reaction from Asian and Western countries. ",1493596907

I've actually had the sleep/wake cycle problem on my own computer. As long as I never let it go to sleep it was perfectly stable. I don't remember it ever having a BSOD without first going through a sleep/wake cycle. After months of trying to figure out what was going on, testing every part, even replacing the motherboard because I figured it was the only thing it could be - my problem was fixed by replacing the seemingly perfectly fine power supply. I can't say for sure that's what is going on with yours but keep it in mind as a possibility.

If you would please run [autoruns](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx), open the Drivers tab, and see if the drivers I mentioned for the virtual DVD program are gone. If they are still there uncheck the box next to them (you'll get a User Account Control prompt so click Yes), close autoruns, and reboot. That should disable them. Then I would test the system by putting it through numerous sleep/wake cycles.

edit: It might also be a good idea to look at the timestamps for the files on autoruns Drivers tab and see if any look old, besides ""Adobe Type Manager"". I'm not sure what's going on with the timestamp on that one but it wouldn't be the problem.",1493596909

Firstly, *both* men and women are meant solely to produce viable offspring like every other living thing (and ideas as well if you follow memetic evolution) has evolved to do.

Secondly, this ""complex understanding"" helps you do just that. 

&gt;. Women are also meant to raise and educate their young, to help their daughters raise their young (as grandmothers) 

Yes, and? That supports greater pregnancies and infants surviving to sexual maturity so they in turn can have viable offspring. Remember it is not about number of offspring, but number of viable (ie offspring that go on to have offspring of their own) offspring.

&gt; No other species on the planet, btw, has grandmothers.

Yes, they do. Elephants, great apes and lions immediately spring to mind. Most tribal species also has the concept of relatives aiding in the development and maturation of the young. Humans didn't invent grandmothers.

&gt;All other female species are fertile until death.

And many women (especially in the past) were fertile until death. We've extended the human lifespan well past the age of menopause. 

Everything we do, both men and women, furthers the prospect of more viable offspring. That's how evolution works.

The Jazz get out in transition more, speed the game up. Contrary to popular belief playing slow, minimizing your possessions and allowing the Warriors to set up their halfcourt defense is a recipe for disaster

Curry and Durant need to play well below their own standards. Missing looks they'd usually hit, being psyched out Rudy's prescence at the rim

Hill shoots well, plays with urgency. Hood needs to play with consistency

Little to no miscommunication from Utah defensively

Warriors role players are utterly ineffective against the Jazz size, Gobert kills their centers in the P&amp;R and on the glass. He and Favors give them a decisive advantage in second chance opportunities

Green gets in foul trouble. Can't hit his 3's, turns the ball over 

Warriors as a team turn the ball over a ton while Utah minimizes their mistakes

Joe Johnson gets Curry into foul trouble on switches

Thompson has one of his infamous cold streaks at the wrong time. Ingles is in his jersey like he just finished doing to JJ Redick",1493596910

"AskEurope","t5_2uayg","&gt; Tell me, how do you tell ""moderate"" muslims from ISIS? What filter do you suggest we use when accepting immigrants?

I suggest doing the same as we do now, welcoming all but keeping tabs on people who become a cause for concern. I'm not overly familiar with the ins and outs but I'm happy to let our security agencies carry on as they are, they do a fine job.

&gt; Do you honestly not believe that if there were fewer muslims in Europe there would be fewer islamically motivated terror attacks in Europe? Because I do. When there were hardly any muslims in (western) Europe there were hardly any muslim terrorist attacks either.

No, I don't. The vast, vast, vast majority of Muslims are not terrorists, so you'd have to be extremely stringent to make sure that none who are actually terrorists slipped through the net. There's hardly any attacks by the IRA here now either, but are there fewer Irish people? I highly doubt it.

&gt; I would advise from visiting Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, muslim ban or no muslim ban. And in any case safety in your own home country should be the priority here and this a distant afterthought at best.

I don't mean the Middle East. I mean countries that would currently be regarded as relatively safe that may become dangerous for tourists as a result of this ban. And what if I want to move elsewhere in the world? Plenty of people make their lives in countries that aren't their own. Again, I don't want to be trapped here out of fear.

&gt; The simplest and most effective solution is not to have muslims in your country. Islam is the problem. The motivation is islamic and the perpetrators muslim - no nonsense about the evil west bringing it upon itself and deserving it will change that fact. The root of the problem is islam and stopping it at its source is by far the most logical and effective solution.

No, Islam is not the problem. A small group of very nasty people, acting in the name of a particularly hardline branch of their faith, is the problem. The perpetrators are Muslim, true, but Islam, like many religions, does not consist of just one branch. It'd be like saying all Christians are white supremacists because the KKK existed. Obviously this is untrue, and so is the thought that all Muslims follow the particular branch of Islam that ISIS follow. The root of the problem is the branch, not the whole tree.

Anyway, I need sleep as it's now 1am here and I have revision to do tomorrow (technically today). Much as I disagree with you in every way, it has been interesting having my thoughts challenged. The only thing I would advise is not to paraphrase people in such a way that it changes the meaning of the quote, as that is no better than the worst media companies and does you no favours in a debate.

One day I was working with my dad, pouring concrete. 

The guys that hired us were drilling a hole I believe. We attached the hose to the drill shaft thing (which could elevate in height). The hole was about 40 or 50 feet deep meaning the hose would eventually reach those heights as the shaft continued to go up. 

Now I guess the guy operating the shaft wasn't suppose to let it get too high without lowering the hose. None of us knew though so the hose got pretty high and up at about 30 or 40 or so feet, one of the metal clamps holding the hose got loose from all the wriggling I guess, and fell off.

This thing was easily 15 pounds and plummeted down to where my dad, the shaft operator and I were standing, it barely missed me by about 2 feet and we all just kinda stared at each other like ""yeah that could have been really bad"".",1493596912

Since when?

&gt; Coulter was invited to Berkeley, not ""anywhere,"" and approved as a speaker, 

And then they asked her not to come.  If I invited you to my house on Friday and then later decided I didn't like you and told you not to come it wouldn't mean you had some right to come to my house.  Invitations can be rescended.

&gt;at which point the government's responsibility is to protect her First Amendment rights

The government has nothing to do with this.  First amendment mean the government can't silence you, which is very obviously not what happens here.  It does not mean it's the government's fault if you get your face kicked in at a bar for running your mouth.  Have you taken highschool history?

That's really enlightening. I had suspected Jerri flipped on him because she didn't trust him after All-Stars and decided the devil she *didn't* know was the better option. It sounds like that's part of what happened.

I think one thing we can safely say about Rob is he sucks at defense. In All-Stars and Redemption Island he had absolute, uncontested control and could drive the season however he wanted. In Marquesas and Heroes vs Villains he had to play off his back foot and just couldn't do it. Case in point, he was playing an unstoppable game in HvV up until Tyson fucked up. And that bit of destabilization completely trashed his game and he could not recover.

Jerri really doesn't get enough credit from some people for her game that season. Parvati played flashier but Jerri made two huge moves that pulled her right to the F4: Flipping on Rob and flipping on Danielle. And if she wasn't playing with an insane delusional person she could have won the season.",1493596922

All I can reccomend is trying to get in touch with the nearest Catholic priest. A lot of churches have websites now, so you should be able to search for Catholic Churches that are near your university or home.

&gt; I'm looking for some help here as I don't know what to do. My options are (from what I know) to increase my credit line, get a personal loan, or transfer the credit. I'm just lost onto where to start looking at the pros/cons so I came here.   
&gt;   
&gt; Here's my low down:  
&gt;   
&gt; I take home about 3k a month

&gt; I have a 50k credit line on the house with a 46k balance

&gt; I have about 20k in credit card debt (300 a month in fees)

&gt; Bills are about 1k (Phone, Gas, Electric, Cable, Car, Insurance)

&gt; My credit score is at 720 right now.
&gt;   
&gt; I dump all my money into the credit line and credit card and keep about 500 bucks cash to spend and it's about 500 short of what we need to live comfortably. I've cooled down my spending dramatically, but my GF just got into pharmacy school and I'm probably going to have to go back to supporting us again which is what got me into this mess. At this point it's time to get a hold of the credit card debt so I can stop leaning on it.   
&gt;   
&gt; Any help would be great. Thanks for reading.

My view (which is still evolving but I am working on it daily) is that if you look at the outcomes of religion across the world in historical and present context, on balance the effects are decidedly negative. I consider the ""misuse"" of religion or the atrocities committed in name of religion to be a negative outcome of religion (I can expand on that if you like). Religion, carried out properly as you say, can absolutely motivate people to be better. It turns out I think that religion is no a necessary condition for moral societies/individuals, and so we can avoid the negative effects of religion and have moral societies.

2. No because I don't think the solution is to vet every single person that comes into Germany. A system for asylum seekers is the priority. In which case, yes, I'm comfortable. I'm of the opinion that it's our duty to pass on a society as good, if not better, than the one we inherited. Sabotaging a cohesive and liberal society because of the risk of more paperwork is indefensible. Plus nobody loves 'massive bureaucratic undertakings' like the Germans.

3. There is no society without its share of saboteurs. That's a challenge. My point is lets not amplify such challenges by importing additional - and in many cases, worse - problems.  By way of lazy analogy: acknowledging that there's already water in the boat shouldn't increase our apathy towards new leaks.

We've built a 'live and let live' society for the most part. But such societies depend on such sentiment being universal. An influx of people who refuse to play by such rules, or don't believe such rules exist, or believe that their rules are better, leads to lack of trust and social cohesion. ",1493596924

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","The differences are just too great. 

I'm not even particularly aggressive with my politics but just knowing I have them is too much for them.

The modern left is a psuedo religous movement. 

The demonization of dissent is a projection complex to show their ""superior virtue"" and receive the spiritual rewards of group acceptance and reassurance. 

Instead of a simple political disagreement it is conflated into a battle of good versus evil which is exactly why we see such hysteria and violence. It is a modern day witch hunt. 

To have non sensical or quisling political views is a small price for them to pay though. It doesnt matter if they believe it or not anyway. 

Its about feeling that they are better people and receiving reasurance that they are ""The good guys"".

There was a time when taking certain left wing political stances took bravery.

That time is long gone now. I don't want to associate with people on the left anymore at all. It's bad enough I have to deal with it in my own family.

I'm going to try to link up with the LA proud boys but I deleted Fakebook. If anybody has resources they can share please let me know.

Private schools are not chosen based on specific principles, they're chosen based on how rich a person is, or how well perceived the school is. There is no great value in allowing parents to choose a school for their children. In fact it would end up stunting economic mobility, because parents would choose schools that most appeal to their work ethic, so kids would be stuck into schools teaching the same skills they learned in their work, meaning the kids would likely end up in the same sector as their parents.

Cheers!


BTW, I'm liking your inquiries because they remind me of our history and prompt me to refresh or research about the related topics so feel free to ask whatever you like. [Here](http://www.sikhnet.com/Siri-Guru-Granth-Sahib) is another good resource for looking up Gurbani and it's english translations. Please keep in mind that many scholars have written english translations and some may be more accurate than others. There can also be instances where multiple (non-contradictory) meanings can be derived from a given passage and each of them may be correct. For me it's analogous to doing prayer recitation where each time I recite the same prayer I have a different type of spiritual growth/experience.


Since you're showing curiosity about sikhi, I'd like to let you know a few basics about Gurbani (Guru Granth Sahib - the scripture). It starts with [Mool Mantar](http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/Mool_Mantar), which is an explanation of the of the source (Vaheguru). The explanation of the Mool Mantar is then expanded on in the first Sikh prayer and the primary morning prayer known as [Jap Ji Sahib](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbkJ39xnza8). The rest of Guru Granth Sahib is considered an expansion on Jap Ji Sahib. All of Guru Granth Sahib is poetry and contains instructions on the manner it can be sung (not a requirement, mind you), except Jap Ji Sahib (it is not meant to be sung, and is not structured/written with that intention). When you go to a Gurdwara and hear singing, it will be recitation from Guru Granth Sahib.",1493596926

I read a comment here awhile ago explaining why this scene punches so hard.
The whole time we're led to believe that Forrest is somewhat oblivious to his disability. He knows he's not normal (""Stupid is as stupid does""), but in most cases everything seems to work out pretty well for him. So because he seems to stumble his way from one success to another, he probably doesn't mind that he isn't very smart, right?
This scene completely blows that assumption out of the water. Forrest has been acutely aware of his condition his whole life. We the audience might wish that our lives could be as ""simple"" and exciting as his, but in this scene we learn that he would throw away all his adventures in a heartbeat just to be smart. Beyond wanting it for himself, he so desperately wants it for his son. Is he smart or is he like me? Will he have a normal life, or have to face the same challenges and struggles I did? His reaction upon finding out that his son is smart says it all.",1493596930

But in real life I have gotten used to it. Because it's my body and I've learned to love it because it's the only one I'll ever have. And I use my flaws to see people's true natures by how they treat me. So I know all my friends are truly good people.


You need to understand that you are not defined by your flaws, but by your positives and the way you use your mind. You can be better than a beautiful celebrity.


But you need to be on your own team here. Be friends with yourself and be kind to yourself. These self doubts and judgment are unkind and you wouldn't say these things to your best friend. Don't say them to yourself. Because you have to live with you for a long time. You best be on good terms.

"politics","t5_2cneq","How do you make all the people ""well regulated,"" then?

I wouldn't call every Dick, Joe, and Harry owning a gun a well regulated militia.

Mind you, I'm not saying ""citizens should not own guns,"" I'm just saying the verbiage of the second amendment does not say ""every person can have guns."" The right of every single American to own guns is not explicitly written into the constitution, because the average citizen does not belong to a ""well regulated milita"" because they are not routinely training on maneuvers, etc. the closest to that is the state reserve forces, which pretty neatly match the image of a well regulated militia.

The right of the average citizen to own guns is a constitution right simply in the fact that if no legislation is in place to forbid it that, and any legislation that would attempt to forbid them to do so would be an undue burden, then their ownership of a weapon cannot be infringed. 

This does not mean that, as an extreme example, were passed to forbid the sale of all firearms is inherently unconstitutional, but it WOULD be unconstitutional to pass a law that required citizens to relinquish their already owned weapons in the absence of a felony conviction. 

I know that this is not a popular stance with guns rights advocates, that it is a slippery slope in their eyes, but so there s the current situation: statistics have been floated about suggesting that practically every single citizen has, at one time or another, committed a felony crime, and probably most of us do so on a fairly regular basis. As such, should the government decide to do so, they could strip most folks of their right to bear arms just by paying closer attention to their activities: NSA data collections are a great threat to your right to bear arms than any proposed legislation in the past few decades, simply because no law needs to be changed to take your weapons, they just need a warrant to go through your communications to find the felony you unwittingly committed.",1493596930

&gt; The lobotomy procedure could have severe negative effects on a patient's personality and ability to function independently. Lobotomy patients often show a marked reduction in initiative and inhibition. They may also exhibit difficulty putting themselves in the position of others because of decreased cognition and detachment from society.
Immediately following surgery, patients were often stuporous, confused, and incontinent. Some developed an enormous appetite and gained considerable weight. Seizures were another common complication of surgery. Emphasis was put on the training of patients in the weeks and months following surgery.

Funny how you just decided to leave out the parts that actually explain *how* it affects intellect.  Being dumb and being confused/dazed are very different things.

Regardless of any of that, this conversation has stemmed from your arguing ad hominem, so I assume you've just given up on debating the original point and that's why you have to resort to plainly insulting me.

arcane whirlwind/Black ice warhorse both have 4k power which is great but the combat powers are not that great

swift golden lion has a great combat power but the mount power isn't that great (except if you pvp, then it can be good unless you want to spam dailies in which case you use the 25% AP gain from the snail)

basically, you need to get 3 mounts. the swift golden lion, tensers and the arcane whirlwind/warhorse :D

-edit- the legendary griffon has a decent combat power with the 30% damage reduction being useful to protect the party if well timed and the mount power is 35% CDR whenever you use your artifact which is not a horrible thing

-edit 2- do you have 25% AP gain from a snail or are you only using a 15% ap mount or something else? because that is a great mount power from the coastal flail snail (or the legacy purple version) but the combat power is poor for a DC

-edit 3- don't forget to buy something pretty so you can display the fact you have a fancy legendary mount. there is nothing worse than having a legendary mount that you don't want to ride because it looks bad in your opinion (a problem i have with the golden lion)",1493596933

A 480 can be flashed to a 580 and there are minor improvements to be had if the silicon you already have is good. I could be wrong and they may release a matured bios and driver at launch that competes with the ti.

However, I expect AMD to do better on launch with their drivers than with Polaris. They have said that they are devoting 80% of there driver team to making Vega good. I assume that if this card is Vega, then the drivers running it are probably tweaked un-optimized Fiji drivers designed to work with Vega. 

That being said, I would expect this card to beat the 1080 at higher clock speeds with optimizations and new architectural improvements which I doubt are yet to be utilized in this benchmark.",1493596936

"solotravel","t5_2rxxm","Well, honestly, no. However I *am* a big fan of fitting as many science museums into my trips as I can, and I guess that's slightly similar.

First off, if you're a sociable, outgoing person then you'll have very little trouble finding someone to talk to in an evening. Whether you find someone wanting a night out depends on when you go, really, but aim for a larger / more popular hostel and you'll probably be alright.

Secondly, a quick taboo check. 90% of the people here, we go on these trips on our own because we want to. We want to see the stuff we like, do the stuff we want to do, stay wherever we want to stay. I like forests and science museums. Some people like beaches and bar hopping. Other people like sports events and exploring the history of public mass transit. You like what you like. Not everyone is going to understand why you want to go to Disney. I don't understand the fascination with Thailand, it just doesn't do it for me. So if you want to go to Disney, go to Disney. If it's something that motivates you enough to book a hostel bed and a ticket, that good enough. Don't worry about what other people think.

Third (and final) slow months are great, but they are slower. Hostels are quieter (good for sleeping!) but also quieter (if you expect an array of bar crawl/walking tour/pizza party stuff to fill your evenings... you'll probably be disappointed). I like being able to chat to the locals to get tips on good food, without feeling like I'm holding up the next group waiting in line. But I also appreciate being able to walk up to a notice board and discover there's a walking tour that ends at a brewery that evening. None of those things are meant to put you off, but it's all worth thinking about. 

Prioritise what you want out of the trip,  and work backwards from there.",1493596937

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Overall a great episode but there were definitely a few inconsistencies. For example, Bill is completely outraged that the Doctor has killed people, but then doesn't even mention that he basically lured someone to his death so he could get the sonic screwdriver (the Ship-Tattoo guy with the fish). The Doctor straight up knew that the fish were being lured by the sound of the sonic, and told the guy to grab it anyway, and then voila he dies - and Bill doesn't have an issue with this other than looking sad for a few moments?

Support ults (Transcendence, Sound Barrier, etc.) are aimed at your teammates, so you hear the same line your team does when you use the ult.

Edge cases would be Infra-Sight (very much support focused but you can argue it's still a global enemy debuff), Teleporter/Shield Generator (the enemy doesn't hear Symmetra say anything), and Nano Boost (this one's just a mess: Ana says one thing that's also heard by her boost target, the rest of the team hears something else, and the enemy hears something completely different).",1493596949

"CodeGeass","t5_2tjxg","I would like for you to not take small bits of my response out of context so that they fit your viewpoint better. 

To begin with, I didn't talk at all about Lelouch sacrificing himself with Zero Requiem, I talked about how Zero Requiem being viewed as an ""escape plan"" is a flawed view point. I explain my reasoning for my own viewpoint later on in the response.

The next point I disagree with is

&gt;If he's alive, he's only alive because he betrayed his personal code (""The only ones who should kill, are those who are prepared to be killed"") and lied to all those who wanted to see him suffer or pay for his crimes (Suzaku, Nina, etc.).

The most outrageous point of this argument is that it assumes that Lelouch faked his death. We as the audience have no concrete understanding of how Lelouch survived and thus can't assume this to be an escape plan until we are given further information on the matter.

You next take one of my points out of context when I said, 

&gt;Whether he accomplishes that by dying, or going into hiding doesn't make too much of a difference

You should also remember that it is prefaced by, 

&gt; Lelouch has seen enough suffering from his friends, family, and the world that I believe he simply wants to rest. 

Since my response has taken the viewpoint that Lelouch wants to rest (I'm not stating that it is a ""correct viewpoint"", merely the one I agree with) your final point about,

&gt;I hope you haven't forgotten that Lelouch only comes up with the plan for Zero Requiem after defeating his father. At this point Lelouch has absolutely nothing and he's left face to face with Suzaku, a man who's immune to his Geass and could whip him into submission with a hand tied behind his back, a man who desperately wants vengeance for Euphemia.

is also invalid in terms of countering my viewpoint. If Lelouch simply wanted to rest, he always had the option of just having Suzaku kill him then and there. It is perfectly reasonable when you take into account Lelouch's guilt for the actions that he has done over the course of CG. After all, he just wanted to make sure that his father was killed so that the world wouldn't be affected by Ragnarok. I believe he went through Zero Requiem because he realized that even with Charles dead, the world would continue going through a cycle of hatred. He wanted to accomplish one last thing with his death, and that would be an attempt at world peace. 

Anyway, I hope you realize that I am not trying to berate you for taking a different stance on Lelouch's character or motives, but when the time comes to have discussions such as this one it is not helpful to your argument to take statements out of context.

What I like about tempo runs is that I do not rigorously stick to staying at a particular pace- I just run faster than normal where it feels challenging but slower than I would in a 5k race and at a pace where it would be difficult to maintain a heavy conversation but I can still talk. Since doing these, I've increased my speed quite a bit- what felt like an all-out sprint has now started to feel more like a tempo run, and what was once a tempo run has now become marathon target pace.

"curlyhair","t5_2t79l","My hair is fine, 2c/3a, medium porosity. I don't see much of a difference when I put in extra effort, and every extra product just weighs me down and stifles the curl. I used to buy every expensive thing that promised results, but now I just:

1) Use any cheap no-cone conditioner with slip to scrub my scalp, lately the RenPure coconut conditioner from Walgreens or the Tresemme Perfectly Undone, then detangle.

2) Use as I am leave-in conditioner, either as a leave-in, or I wrap it in a grocery bag to deep condition while I shave or clean the bathroom. 

3) ACV rinse once a week, or just a cold upside down rinse every wash to keep my bangs from getting trampled. 

4) Dry with an old t-shirt and scrunch in the OGx Curling Perfection defining cream

5) On second and third days, I just scrunch a little of the RenPure/Tresemme conditioner and then add water. 

The best part about my routine is that I can skip literally any step and it's fine. Only want to use one conditioner? Fine. Don't want any product left in? Fine. That way I can just listen to my hair and do extra steps when it's feeling too dry and undefined. I don't really plop anymore, I just scrunch it as dry as I can and then chill on the couch with my hair flipped up onto the back until it's dry enough to hold its own weight. 

EDIT: I'm not 100% sure that the RenPure conditioner is cone free, but I do ACV rinses regularly enough that it doesn't really matter. ",1493596953
"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; I don't think it undercuts the philosophy of the show to say that Kyubey's perspective, while perhaps valid, is not the most ideal and has some glaring flaws that he's refusing to acknowledge because it doesn't serve his purposes.

Obviously it's a skewed perspective on it. I'm almost going a bit meta here on this one though as to why even by Kyubey standards we should take what he says here with a bit more of a grain of truth.

Though obviously the way he presents it will always be sketchy as fuck but the fundamental mechanics of the inevitability and that it's the girls' own desires that ultimately betray them are sound.  It's the building blocks of the show's philosophy of hope and despair that Madoka ultimately counteracts not just by overturning the system but the manner of her wish negating the problems.

It of course does not absolve Kyubey of his part is pushing girls into terrible decisions.",1493596953

Barwin was one of PFF's lowest graded starting RDEs in the league and Curry was only slightly higher graded. Them being on the right didn't help any, but Graham is a perfect fit for the left end position in Schwartz's system. He's super athletic and Shwartz's attack is based on DE's beating OT's wide. If you watch Barnett's film and review the numbers... I've never seen a RDE do a better job getting around LT's in my entire life watching film. 

The biggest factor, though, is DEs converging in on the QB from both side and squeezing him up to the DTs. Last year, Barwin and Curry were both inconsistent in that regard and couldn't beat the block with their hands or feet quick enough. They pressured and put hits on the QBs but that sack count was horrendous and we let up too many big outside runs because Barwin and Curry don't set the edge sometimes. Nolan Carroll and Mychal Kendricks looked like absolute bafoons out there once the edge was exposed. Teams knew to attack us on our right side so hopefully that's no longer the case.",1493596954

The iPhone is changing. 2017 marks the 10th anniversary of the world’s best selling smartphone and  is planning a major (if expensive) redesign. Now we know a lot more…
As a tonic to the triple confirmation that Apple’s flagship iPhone will be delayed, there is now better news because a further three independent leaks have revealed exciting and - most importantly - consistent details which show this is a device worth waiting for. 



Benjamin Geskin

Interestingly two of the leaks are detailed schematics. The first (simultaneously obtained by reliable veteran OnLeaks and prolific newcomer Benjamin Geskin) shows a design entirely in keeping with everything we have heard so far: vertical dual camera arrangement, home button removed, both the front facing camera and Touch ID integrated under the main display, no return for the headphone jack and the introduction of wireless charging (the circular component). 

This was soon corroborated by a far more detailed schematic from the endless Apple treasure trove that is Weibo. Again wireless charging is at the heart of the design and OnLeaks found perfect alignment between the two diagrams, while Geskin illustrated how the schematics fit perfectly into the render he had previously created:

The latest 2017 iPhone schematics fit perfectly inside existing renders.





Lastly adding further credibility to these leaks is none other than Elad Dubzinski, CEO of wireless power giant Powermat. In an official press release discussing the growth of wireless charging he let slip: “wireless charging will become a standard feature in the next iPhone, [so] we are finally at the threshold of mainstream adoption.”
All of which means we may finally be able to banish fears of Apple’s modest Plan B iPhone backup. Companies will always prepare multiple test versions of a device, but with this year being the 10th anniversary it seems Apple has adopted a strategy of no compromise and will simply swallow the delay. 
Of course what the name of this all new iPhone will be remains less clear. History says we should expect the ‘iPhone 7S’, but that may be reserved for two lesser models while 7S, iPhone 8 and iPhone X (given there is no more ‘macOS X’) all make little sense for a 10th anniversary device. My tips: iPhone Edition or even ‘iPhone’. 
Regardless I expect Apple to break sales records here, as do investors judging by the company’s stock performance. And that’s despite a massive price hike...

As I said in my linked post (not sure if you can see it since OP deleted it), it's possible for your float heights to be within spec but your float valves leak, or the fuel level is out of spec. 

It's a bit of work to check fuel level but it's the best way to find out if one or more of your float valves isn't working right. Depending on the bike it may be far easier to check it with the carb rack on the workbench rather than installed on the bike. In fact if your carbs are mounted at an angle, it can be practically impossible to tell if your fuel level is in spec or not, since it will be both above and below the parting line, depending on where you measure it. This was the case with my EX250, hence me measuring it with the carbs on the bench, held perfectly level.

I can find the 30m free, but need better resolution for work.  In this environment 30 horizontal meters can be more than 100m vertically, 15m horizontal, and another 50m back down the other side of a feature.  Some of the karst pillars are smaller than 30m at the base and basically don't show up at all.

Purchasing the 1m datasets is far beyond the budget of our project (the cost is nearly the annual budget of our project) and even the 5 meter would be a sever financial strain on us.

I need them to run habitat analysis, make detailed contour maps for the national park rangers and out field staff, etc.

If anyone has access to 5m or finer or knows where I can get access to those free (or for a very minor cost), please let me know.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","""Oh, I don't know,"" I said. I hoped that my voice sounded as nonchalant to her as it did in my head. ""Now seems like a pretty good time.""

""Really?"" She let out a low, braying moan. How I hated that sound. ""We're tied up, about to die, and you want to talk about last night? Honestly, Steve, do you really need *me* to tell you why we're divorcing?""

I ignored the sarcasm in her voice. ""I'd rather not meet my maker with this business unresolved.""

She snorted. ""Don't you think we'll have plenty of time in heaven?""

""Certainly,"" I said. ""But I don't expect you to be there with me.""

That earned me a furious wriggle. We were tied back-to-back, with an ominously tickling box between us. The cable ties around our arms and wrists didn't allow us much freedom. It was the first fight we'd had in years where nothing had been smashed. It was a shame. I really felt like throwing a vase at Linda right now.

A wire ran from the box to a rudimentary dial that ticked down the seconds in demoniacally glowing red LCDs. The dial of the clock was the only light in the little room our kidnappers had deposited us in apart from the blinking light of a CCTV camera on the wall. Whoever the assholes were who'd stolen us from our hotel beds that morning, they wanted to watch us suffer.

The counter hit the ten minute mark.

""To get back to my original question,"" I continued once I'd steadied my nerves, ""what I don't understand is why you waited until we were on vacation to ask for a divorce. Wouldn't it have been easier back home?""

""Hey, this vacation wasn't my idea,"" she snapped. ""Blame our marriage counsellor, why don't you? But no, you were the one who had to flash your wallet every time a pretty local girl came near you. You know, that's probably why we got kidnapped. Somebody wanted your money.""

""I doubt it. I still have my wallet and they never asked for a ransom.""

""Do you have a better idea?""

""I do,"" I said. ""Where were you last night?""

""None of your business.""

""Oh ho, I think it is. You're still my wife. For another nine minutes, anyway.""

""Fine. I couldn't bear to be in the same room as you after I asked for a divorce, so I asked the hotel for a different room.""

""With a view of the water."" It wasn't a question.

""How do you know-. Oh.""

""Yes,"" I said. ""'Oh'. I saw you gallivanting about on the balcony last night. But did my eyes deceive me, or was there a second figure up there with you. Perhaps that pool attendant you were so fixated on all day.""

She tried to lash out at me with her leg, but the ropes holding us together were too tight. She settled for, ""You bastard. I might have known you'd poke your nose into my business.""

""I may be a bastard,"" I said. ""But at least I'm no whore.""

""Did your secretary tell you that before or after she fucked you?"" She was screaming now. God, I loved to wind her up. If these were the last nine minutes of my life, at least I'd get as much entertainment out of them as possible.

""Well, my dear, it may have escaped your notice but adultery is illegal here. Perhaps this is the local way of telling us to take our Western immorality back where we came from.""

""So you're blaming me for this?""

""My, your remarkably bright this morning. Did you forget to take any of those pills you're so fond of?""

In hindsight I was lucky she was tied up. As it was she thrashed like a crocodile's prey trying to get at me and, like the prey, it didn't do her much good.

When she'd stopped struggling, she slumped back against me, and began to heave giant sobs. 

""Don't cry, honey,"" I said. ""Think of all the money we'll save on the divorce.""

Before she could respond, the door of our little prison opened, and a shadowy figure came in. A disgusted, but familiar, voice said, ""Ok, that's quite enough. Untie them.""

I squinted towards the woman. ""Madeline?""

""Yes, Mr. Harley. I'm sorry to disappoint you, but you'll be spending quite a lot on that divorce after all. Mrs. Harley, it's ok. This was just an exercise.""

My wife began to scream. ""An exercise? AN EXERCISE? I'll have our lawyers on you so hard you'll wish you were... you were... Don't just stand there Steve, help me out!""

""Actually,"" Madeline James, America's most famous (and expensive) marriage counsellor, said, ""you won't. Do you remember that little contract you signed when you started your sessions with me? You gave me permission to use any means I deemed necessary.""

As hands loosened the ropes that bound me, I found my voice at last. ""You mean... this whole vacation was a set-up?""

""I'm afraid so, Mr. Harley. I often prescribe vacations to the clients that I counsel. Perhaps you remember the moonlit elephant ride that I planned, which was supposed to rekindle your romance. Until you lost your temper at the driver in a drunken rage, and were thrown off. Or the private cruise on the yacht, that accidentally left you stranded on the island? You were supposed to bond over that, not threaten to cannibalize your wife.""

""And this was a bonding experience too?""

The marriage counsellor sighed. ""I've used it as a last resort on seven couples before you too. In each case, they were able to work together to escape and overcome their differences through the experience. It even worked on that famous Hollywood couple who were always in the news until they hired me. But you two...""

She shook her head. ""If that had been a real bomb, I don't think either of you needs to worry about ending up in Heaven."" And before I could have the satisfaction of firing her, she added, ""Consider this a termination of our arrangement. When you get home you'll find my final bill in the mail.""

Come up with a statement that counteracts on a fundamental level the emotion you're dealing with. For me I hate myself was what I would hear in my head
Counterstatement
I fully and completely love and accept myself. 
There's no room to hate yourself on that statement you dig?
Then you tap while you say your statement 
 and you tap these places
Above eyebrows 
On cheeks below eyes
Switch to one handed dominant hand tapping 
Above lip
On chin
Bottom of neck between those two bones ?collarbone??
Both hands again now 
Beneath armpits on obliques
Single hand where wrist meets hand
Single hand on meaty part of thumb bottom of hand

"lrcast","t5_330dh","My thought process for each of these was as follows, and I'll freely admit I could have been wrong about any one of them:

I did side the guardian in against aggressive decks and it did alright, but I still think the beetle does the job better. The beetle doesn't die to 3/5 camels or the two mana 3/3 trampler in red at common or some random 2/2 with a cartouche. It also doesn't turn every random pump spell into removal. I just needed to clog up the board until I could get an engine online and the beetle did that job well.

I've been pretty underwhelmed by illusory wrappings in most decks since it leaves the creature with all of its abilities and as a blocker, but this may have been the deck for it. I didn't really want to cut a creature or actual removal though, and I wanted all of my other stuff to have cycling.

Pitiless Vizer was kind of in an awkward position. Against aggro which dominates the format a four mana 4/2 is way too slow and it can't become indestructible until turn 5 at the earliest which means it can't block profitably the turn it comes down. Once I've survived initial aggression I can do more with a cycler to look for my combo pieces or to fuel my existing combo pieces than I can with the vizier. 

What I really would have loved would have been the horror since it cycles for one, has an effect when you cycle other things, while being a 4/4 body when you run out of gas, but unfortunately I wasn't passed any.",1493596962

It brings rise to fury

A system broke

By the people 

for the people

More like buy the people

Fur the people

Unless you have melanin 

Listen man I'm tellin' em

Then it is fleece the people

Whether by hook

Or by steeple

Pity a crook

Ask the men they are lecturing her

""Your dress is too short,

Your legs are too long.

You were asking for it,

You had on a thong!""

Yet the same man calls her a prude

When she turns him down

Because he was rude

You wonder why she has a frown

Do your duty

Life, liberty, and the pursuit...

It is not your duty

I suggest you peruse it

Happiness has been pursued 

Like a criminal

Kept terse, sued

Listen men, women, all

We have chased happiness away....

I suppose it's not totally unreasonable for me to force users to template the arguments supplied. However, making the user repeateadly supply the same information multiple times always strikes me as poor practice.

I'm using this to extend my game engine. I decided that, since I was already at it, that I'd abstract this out and future proof the solution in a sense. I'm more than willing to abstract this out now and have a very *user friendly* implement. 

That said, the crux of the issues is with the handler class. I already supply the program with what data the Events are. There's some very bad, hackish solutions to this on my mind. I seem to have done enough of that already, so I'll take a more thorough look at better solutions for handling.

And when I was younger it wasn’t so small,

It stretched so that no other places were seen,

So we had to accept what the ocean would give us

Or settle for nothing at all. 

-

One morning, a man wearing nothing but rags

Was found on the beach, washed up from the shore,

Though he wouldn’t speak, we invited him in

And fed him until he was full, or at least

Would not accept food anymore. 

-

He stayed in a cabin we kept as a spare,

And made sure he slept and provided him food,

But after some weeks many people had thought

He had outstayed his welcome and didn’t seem grateful,

The bad had outpaced the good. 

-

One morning the men who had made their decision

Went to the cabin to ask him to go,


And, until that moment, he had never spoken,

He didn’t speak to them either, this time,

At least, as far as we know. 

-

He stood up and walked to the beach he had come from,

And as he got closer the water pulled back,

At every point, all the water receded

Until he was gone, we could only see sand,

And then, skyline went black.

Sometimes cultures are different, for example in the US having a mistress is not as acceptable as it is in European politics.  The thought process is if even his own wife, whom he presumably loves, can not trust him then can the general public trust him?  In Europe that seems to be yes but in the US that tends to be no.

I cut up fruits and steamed veggies when I do my meal prep on Sunday (also keto) and set them aside for the kids. 11 month old has loves carrots, broccoli, melon, or berries. Sometimes she eats sugar snap peas too. But she has a lot of teeth so my experience probably varies.

Oh! I read about some cookies made with bananas, oats, and peanut butter powder. Those might be good for kiddo but also probably tempting for you. 

As for full meals I'm a terrible help. My kids eat whatever I eat, or fruits and veggies... But I am a carb addict and can't really keep other things in the house or I will eat them. Sometimes I make them vegetable fried rice (because I don't like it), and they eat it cold for a couple days.

We really just eat a lot of eggs. You could make frittatas in a muffin tin and reheat those as necessary if you want more variety from hard boiled and scrambled eggs.

You're quite right, euro isn't the contributing factor to the success. I got my thoughts mixed, my apologies.

&gt;It's easy for Belgians or Dutch to see themselves as European as they are central Europe.  We are peripheral to Europe a bit like the Finns,  Portugaleese and Greeks...Peripheral countries are doomed to suffer country specific asymetrical shocks because of the euro. 

I am not convinced on what you're saying about peripheral nations. Finns are still pro-EU and doing well as far as I am aware and Ireland is the strongest performer in terms of GDP growth. I can't say about Portugal but I would attribute the economic failures of Ireland and Greece to internal mismanagement instead of EU. Greece was particularly very callous with public spending under the previous conservative government who practically gave people hand outs to keep voting for them as well as manipulating financial records to keep their credit rating good in appearances. The bail out term was harsh but that was their own doing and the Germans are pissed about bailing out the Greeks. But really, the loose governance of the EU and the incompatibilities of individual nation's policies are partly to blame for the financial shockwave that reverberated the union so it's understandable if the EU wanted more control of the rein. That's not to say that I would like more integration but it's incorrect to put the blame solely to the EU especially that we are the ones who fucked up.  ",1493596968

"news","t5_2qh3l","I went, and I had to pay for my bus ticket, and my food, and my metro pass, and I couldn't work Saturday. Attending this march cost me a few hundred dollars. 

Considering I make $60-75 an hour while working, it would take a little bit more than $15 an hour to get me to skip work, if I was only going because I was being paid. 

The majority of the people on my bus to DC were professionals with a degree, and the majority of the people I met at the march were Sierra Club members. There were other groups present there as well, but the Sierra Club had chapters there from many states. 

I'm not sure where you are getting the idea that ""most of the kids there were from Denver."" That's simply not true. Most were from the greater DC area: Maryland, Virginia, Baltimore, Delaware, North Carolina, etc. I also met people from New England, Texas, and New Jersey. I can't recall meeting a single person from Colorado, and I didn't see the Colorado chapter of the Sierra Club there (although they very well could have been there). 

I know you like this narative that some rich Jewish guy is paying poor people to go protest, but the majority of the Climate March participants were professionals. $15 an hour to ride on an all night bus and then stand in 91 degree heat isn't really all that great of a deal. Take into account that a round trip on the metro is $8, bottled waters were a few bucks a piece, food from a food truck was $10 or more -- your $15 isn't going to go very far. 

If you want to actually see who attends these events, my advice would be to go to one and ask questions. You don't have to march or anything, but just try to form your own opinion about who these people are. The shit your reading (whatever the source) is doing a piss-poor job keeping you accurately informed.

1. Minimum wage is too low. Cost of living has been accelerating faster than the minimum wage for decades.

3. Of course people with more valuable skills make more money in our current society. My point of contention is that minimum wage is too low, and companies absolutely can afford to pay more. 

People shouldn't be trapped in poverty because millionaires and billionaires want to amass unnecessary amounts of wealth. I was trapped in poverty at one point, and was fortunate enough to have my vocational school paid for by a family member. I was fortunate enough to not have children or debt, and yet still I was trapped. Poverty is a manufactured prison for the benefit of the very wealthy, and intention is irrelevant to the end result.

"OverwatchUniversity","t5_3ejpe","It really is situational based on the map, and not killing anyone doesn't mean the Ult wasn't effective.  It may have caused 4 enemies to run, which were then hunted down and killed.  It may have cleared the point/payload long enough to help secure the objective.

 That being said here are a few things that may help, if any of these are painfully obvious I apologize:

* It's almost always better to throw your ult up in the air then to explode on the ground.  You have a better chance of taking out high ground (ie Genji, Hanzo, Winston) and airborne enemies (Pharah, Mercy), and are able to threaten more enemies with it.
* Throw it over walls and through windows.  The confusion that results from not knowing where DVa is when she begins her ult can lead to not knowing where to seek cover.  The shorter of a time the enemy has to react the greater the chance of taking them out.
* What is the enemy Winston / Rein doing?  They can make your ult useless.  Try to ult only when you see that their shield is on cool down, especially Rein.  An ult again an enemy rein with a shield up is almost always wasted, not even achieving much scattering of the enemy team.
* Look for a flanking route.  Usually DVa should be front and center with her team to make best use of her Damage Matrix but when using her ult the element of surprise is so important that a flanking route is often better.
* When throwing your ult, try to aim for the back line as usually people will instinctively run toward their own spawn rather than toward the enemy line.  Aiming your ult to land in the back of the enemy line towards their supports and DPS will usually get more kills, and also cause them to scatter in more directions.  Sometimes even if you get nobody the disarray caused by her ult can put the enemy team at a significant disadvantage.

I'm by no means an amazing DVa but I do play her a bit and one of my frequent OW buddies is a DVa main.  Most of the above I've learned from watching him tbh.  Hope the tips help!",1493596973

But I honestly have the feeling that you didn't follow the story around him at all and are now forming an opinion on the subject without knowing what he did and for how long he did it and in return you call me negative for stating something that is clearly the most logical thing to assume (occam's razor).  
High elo players (even pros) would dodge games over this guy. He was ruining the game for many months, day after day.  
He had a shit list with people on it for who he would automatically ruin the game from the minute the game started by intentionally feeding (just running it straight down).  
He had a total of 17 accounts permabanned over this period (22 by now). Once again, he did this for a very long time before riot started banning him on sight.  
Also, his popularity came exactly from being like this. People were watching him to see him rage at people in chat and intentionally ruin games by feeding. This is what his fans loved.  
Now you're in here stating that the publicity may have caused him to take another look at his actions. Nope. It was the fact that he was now starting to get a popular stream but the second his stream turned on Riot banned his account.  
So he actually had something to lose now, his stream income.  
He had MANY chances to reform over all these months of negative publicity but he actually made his negative image his selling point. Once riot started banning on sight that was over so it was time to 'reform'.  
By the way, congratulations on graduating from medical school, this clearly has to do with the subject we're talking about, thanks for the insights.",1493596974

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Depends? Like on which console?

If you're building a PC to emulate SNES games, building is probably cheaper than buying a console (because hipster demand means SNES's can sell for way more than they're worth).

If you want to play XB1/PS4 gen games on a PC, you're going to spend more building. $800-1k if you're skimping on the luxuries. $1k-1.5k if you want some of the good stuff. You build not because you're cost sensitive, but because you're performance sensitive.

Ult lines would work too.

All that would do is make everyone ignore audio in the game.

I'm coming at the debate from a different angle. I want the barrel length specifically. I know that the .mil's ammo isnt exactly match grade, but I prefer the 6 inches on the barrel because it does make a difference if you ever have to get into long drawn out distances.

I've shot 600m with ironsights with a 20 inch barrel and it was doable. The shorter barrel of the M4 isnt going to allow that, and since I am looking to specifically maximize the range I'm going to go with the 20 inch.

That said if my mission was to specifically go in and clear buildings non stop and that was basically the crux of my deployment then yes I'd obviously want the M4 and I would let the guy with the 240 reach out and touch people far away.

So much of it got done this weekend. We bought his suit, I bought wedding party presents and accessories, last week I bought my ring, we're pretty close to budget even though fiance's outfit was much more expensive than we thought. 

Things to do:

I kept working on our decor and that's going to be every weekend between now and then, I think. Only thing left to buy is his wedding ring (that's planned at least); I need to finish our cranes, card box and guest canvas - if that goes to plan then I'll be able to fit in finishing my rainbow petticoat. I also have to finish off the playlist (have drafted it and listened to it and I'm not 100% on it), figure out logistics for playing the playlist, and write detailed timelines for everyone. Thank you speech, photo request list. When we'll pick up the cupcakes. How to display the cupcakes. Dress alterations booked in for next weekend. Set up and tear down plans. Harass the venue for answers about drinks, set a bar tab for the time that's not covered by the drinks package.

Invites have gone out and about 50% RSVPs back. No ""nos"" yet. I don't see many nos coming in (famous last words?)

It's just nitty gritty stuff, for the most part. We will be getting married even if I get nothing done in the next 10 weeks. But it feels so real and so close and I feel like I'm going to hurl. God.",1493596980

You have completely disregarded the evidence I proposed to you. So I will copy and past a bit of it.

I don't know much about Minnesota populations so this may not be true, but Minneapolis is Blue, and the surrounding area could be farm land or richer rural housing area's who normally vote Republican. If you look at NC where I am from and most other states in the south you will see large populations of Democrats in Cities and Republicans in Rural. I believe this holds true for most areas. You then have to look at other influences (I.E. Education levels, religious influences). I believe Minnesota has a fairly decent education system (ranked 10 from a quick google search and that is after ""plummeting""). More educated people tend to vote Democratic. This will not hold true to all educated and uneducated(read high school max) populaces. After factoring all of this data you look at by how much a margin the candidates won by. If it is a slim margin it might deal with voter turn out, or persuasion. Looking at a congressional map with no extra information is like looking at an impressionist painting. I can normally figure out what it might be, but with out the artist mindset, and things going on in their life you can't get extrapolate more from the painting than how it makes you feel, and if you like it or not.

This is what /u/Lazylifter was talking about Dem's have a 7/3 victory, but territory wise Republicans look like they have a larger chunk.

"feedthebeast","t5_2v620","2D GUI design is all about recognizing common visual patterns, and deliberately using or omitting them where appropriate.

Top-lit UI panels were quite common until the ugly new flatshaded UIs were popularized by a few large corporations (and everyone panicked to follow the trends), as the older style of baking lighting into UI textures didn't work on phone and tablet screens laid on a table and observed from multiple angles, rather than fixed-upright PC screens.

I bet it would work even better with an explicit point light source just offscreen, if all apps could be convinced to follow the design, but as it is, we lose an entire dimension of subconscious hinting, because Microsoft set a trend by unifying Win8 PC and mobile visuals, and everyone else foolishly copied that in their web page designs.


I expect that cursor shadows provide a subtle hint that the cursor is not confined to the UI ""below"" it, and helps to further distinguish the solid cursor colour from similar background colours. This was the case in earlier windows versions, but the unlit flatshaded look at least had, if not still has, overtaken far too many visual designs.",1493596983

1) Is glycogen related to muscle loss, or what causes muscle loss?

2) If you're a runner/ walker doing it for the sake of fat loss would it be more beneficial not to eat carbs before and instead protein? If the goal is weight loss over performance.

3) if someone loses 20 lbs in 3 ish weeks, how much would you say is just that initial 'plunge' and when does the real fat loss happen?

"discgolf","t5_2qk68","If you throw either disc on an anhyzer, you are releasing it with the wing opposite your grip tilted up.  In this case both discs will hold the right turn.  The disc with 0 turn should hold the angle you give it while the -3 disc will turn even harder to the right as it flies forward.

Whether or not the 0 turn disc pans out depends on a number of variables.  In general, given calm weather, the shorter the throw and the less severe of an anhyzer you give it, the more likely it is to flatten out.  The harder you throw it the more likely it is to hold the release angle to the ground.

You can throw overstable mids on an anhyzer and they'll do a good job fighting back to flat or even fading left a little.  This line is called a flex shot amd is useful for getting around obstacles.

Throwing both flat the one with 0 turn should go straight and have a late, mild fade.  The -3 disc should turn to the right.",1493596986

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","That outfit is decidedly masculine - plain shirts with that cut at the neck will probably serve you well, although the jeans might be a bit on the skinny side, as they're giving me the impression of slightly wide hips and, well, a small penis at best.
 
Ultimately, I think the people misgendering you are likely reading from your face and (unfortunately) your height. Growing facial hair will sadly just take time, although I'd say your eyebrows are definitely bushy enough to look masculine, although they do have a bit of an arch to them right now. There's not a lot you can do about your height, but I agree that building a bit of muscle would help. It's nothing to fuss over, ultimately - there are plenty of short cis men out there.  
(Again, I don't have much advice for how to dress formally; my 'interview as a man' kit includes exactly one dress shirt, a tie borrowed from my father, and some vastly-too-big dress pants. Unfortunately, men's formal clothing tends to be tighter at the chest than everyday casual stuff.)
  
Behavior and voice also don't show up in photographs. The way you move and act is important - as someone who not once in her life tried to act masculine, I can't really offer a ton of advice there. And while testosterone will almost certainly help lower the pitch of your voice (5 months is usually a work-in-progress stage for voice changes, if anything), it won't change the *manner* in which you speak, so consider that as well.  
  
Edit: Oh, and you do look like a guy, in my opinion, thought not a particularly masculine one.  
  
Edit x2: Someone else here mentioned button-ups. Yes. Those look good and come across as masculine. My sister apologized for buying me one for my birthday before she found out.",1493596986

Its fucking hilarious, because for shits and giggles I put on FOX in Friends when I woke up this morning. 

They were shilling the same story about Trump being super open and telling reporters that he'd be willing to answer any questions they had. Like, how fucking dumb do you have to be to believe that when the media has a pretty overwhelming belief that this is not the truth? You're acting like Trump hasn't framed the media as the enemy of the American people and a defacto arm of the Democratic Party. You're acting like Trump isn't using a revitalized version of textbook Goebbels Lugenpresse.

&gt; They said so at the WHCA dinner.

No. Jeff Mason said it. And he just had a very long expose interview with Trump, in addition to being the leader of the press corps. Might that have had to do with the statement? Merkel may think Trump is a fucking moron, but she's give him nothing but respect in public. Also, Mason has made it clear when he says ""access"", he means being able to talk to Trump. Not exactly useful if you're being fed BS when you do talk to him, which he also often concedes is probably the case.

&gt; Then, he spoke to the NRA and promised to never touch the 2A and to roll back existing gun regulations.

Only ignorant people think that blanket gun control is an important aspect of fascism. If you're seriously uneducated enough to think that most German households didn't have a weapon pre-1939, I'm not sure what to tell you other than to read about what you're so confident about. What is relevant in fascist regimes is **specific, targeted gun control**. However, since the left is rarely armed, its not really even necessary in the US for a fascist transition.

You really have to be familiar with history and politics before you go making absurd claims ..

Also, Trump will never be a dictator. And the reason isn't that he's a good guy who wouldn't abuse his powers like you suggest. Its because we have a deified Constitution with very powerful legal writ and vigorously respected judiciary. But don't act like his supposedly ""conservative"" voters wouldn't support nationalization in a heartbeat if he suggested it. There is no ideology. His only goal is to be ""great"" whatever the fuck that means, and his voters only want to ""MAGA"", without having an ideological compass or leader to get actual change done. 

At worst, he'll turn his administration into one similar to what you have in banana republics until he's voted out of office in 4 years. Most likely, however, he just wallows for the next 3+ years as nothing gets done and GOP fatigue sets in.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Maybe your right, but I don't think this is an ""old people"" problem. I think this is a broader social problem that we need to address as a people. In either case, I really hope we do figure this out. I may live in a racial majority now, but that's NOT how I grew up, and it's very strange for me to see the shoe on the other foot so to speak (I realize how ridiculous this sounds coming from a white male in his mid-30's living in rural Oregon).


The problem seems so simple to solve, if we could only get people to see what's really causing it. Fear and resentment. We can find better, more effective solutions than fighting and punishment. I truly believe people aren't hateful in nature, just fearful and ignorant. When I was a kid in the Virgin Islands a man named Adelbert Bryan was a popular political figure promising to ""cleanse"" the territory of the white people. I spent recess in school with the vice principal most of the time, she probably thought I was an odd kid, but I was hiding. The local kids would do stupid shit, chase me down and kick my ass, or chase me up a tree and hold me there while they got a teacher to get me in trouble (no climbing trees). They did this because they thought I was stealing their home, their parents thought our parents were taking good jobs from locals and hoarding up all the businesses. It's the same shit, it's just the skin colors are changed around. As I got older and people got to know me personally the hate against whites continued, but I stopped being considered white, earning the label ""clear skin"" and enjoying a position in their culture and society, once I wasn't an outsider anymore, I was just another dude. 


It's really hard to see this as anything other than fear and ignorance when you've grown up with that perspective.",1493596991

&gt; It was pretty hostile and deceitful. 

And Microsoft intentionally stealing services from Google in order to show youtube videos without ads wasn't? Microsoft threw their own users under the bus by violating their contracts with Google and then not fixing the problem when it was pointed out.

&gt; It was pretty shady and shitty by their users. 

They weren't Google's users if MS wasn't showing them the ads they're supposed to be playing.

Google gave MS the code to play youtube videos properly. MS refused to use it. Who is ""in the wrong"" here is something I think you'd have to be an insider to figure out.",1493596992

Latency is game traffic to the server, processing of that traffic, and then the return. Latency is always higher than ping. Unfortunately, in order to find out what your latency is you have to pull up the graph... which is annoying af.

You can ping to a server just fine but still have high latency because the server doesn't process any corresponding data with ping. 

If there are server issues, like, for example, people connecting with high ping, then that can effect the server tickrate, which must then wait for those high ping clients, which can in turn effect everyone's latency. This can all happen even though your ping is 40ms. Because again, in terms of processing game data to and from the server, ping is meaningless.

To be clear, both are getting on in age, but are reasonably user serviceable. I've been inside my 8000 a good number of times now to relubricate the rails and tidy up in there, and you don't need any special tools outside of silicone lubricant. Still, it can be a bit of a pain. 

The 8000 and 9000 have almost identical hardware, but Nikon goofed and screwed up the calibration on the special three-line CCD in the 8000. At lower than maximum dpi you'll be okay, but scanning at full resolution and full speed generates basically unfixable banding. The solution is to use fine mode, which only uses one line of the sensor-- in exchange for a 1/3rd as fast scan speed.

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","FHA has both an upfront 1.75% (that can be financed) and monthly mortgage insurance. 

Conventional, typically, it's one or the other. You can pay the insurance policy off upfront, or pay it monthly. 

Fannie and Freddie's 97% LTV programs, that are part of their congressional mandate, are both currently more competitive than FHA, assuming you do not presently own real estate and have good credit. You don't hear about them, and see lenders pushing FHA, for three reasons:

* FHA is more profitable. Our employers pat us on the back when we do a bunch of FHA. It's been illegal to explicitly pay us more for shoving everyone in FHA since 2013, but banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies, get busted for de facto ""paying for profitability"" all the time.

* FHA typically has a lower nominal interest rate, even though in every other way it is worse. So for people that are just like ""BOTTOM LINE JACK WHAT'S THE RATE AND DON'T YOU GO OFF WITH YOUR FANCY SILVER TONGUED DEVIL-SPEAK?!"" and don't really want to understand things, you shut them up &amp; give them what they want by going FHA. (Though looking at that Wells Fargo link, maybe FHA doesn't have a lower note rate at Wells...)

* The Fannie/Freddie congressional mandate 97% LTV programs take another few hours for the LO to originate and submit compared to FHA.

[Here's a commercial for Fannie's 97% LTV program](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BNfRtb7TgY).

There are times when FHA makes more sense, or is the only option (like bruised credit, over income limit for census tract, high balance, etc). But I'd advise first timers with minimal down to explore at least one of the two 97% LTV options. Most ""special deal just for you because you're a first timer!"" type deals are shell games, but the basic Fannie/Freddie 97% LTV are part of their congressional mandate and legit.

This is why it is really easy to give people false memories, by encouraging them to remember something that didn't actually happen, and then their mind will remember a particular little detail that might fit, and then automatically construct the memory that's desired around that actual detail (and sometimes the detail is unrelated to the actual memory you're falsifying).

I'm not a PhD student, but I am finishing up my first year in a clinical doctorate program. My mom was diagnosed with stage three breast cancer back in August, the week before I started my program. She went through six cycles of chemotherapy, had surgery in January, did 30 straight days of radiation treatment, and will continue with chemo through the end of August. I won't lie, it's been hard to juggle everything and stay sane at the same time. I spent that first semester working hard on coursework and clinic duties during the week, and drove home (only 1.5 hours away, YMMV) to help take care of my mom most weekends. I'm interested in pursuing research, but had to put a lot of that on hold my first semester to accommodate the chaos. So I was able to juggle my coursework and clinical duties fine, but as a PhD student your obligations are obviously a little more demanding than mine. Overall, I guess, structure is what helped me. I set up a huge calendar with everything I needed to get done each week before the weekend and stuck to it. 


Managing the stress and emotional side of things has been more complicated. I'll admit, my strategy has been to bottle everything up and never let it out ... 0/10, would not recommend that approach. I've spent more time crying in my office than I care to admit. Plus, back in December, smack-dab in the middle of finals week, my grandpa was diagnosed with and passed away from end-stage pancreatic cancer all within the span of four days. I just sort of... broke down and couldn't do anything for the remainder of that week. So... don't treat me as an example. I'll bet your university has free or cheap counseling services for students. I would utilize that resource. And, find some time during the week to set aside for yourself, even if it's just half an hour.

"politics","t5_2cneq","It was designed that way. The problem is we're shifting the goalposts... and I can't say I don't want the goalpostts to shift... i do, kinda. But i recognize my bias. If the Senate being non-representative of the people now means that our democracy isn't healthy, then the truth is that it was never healthy, because the Senate was never representative of the people. 

So perhaps your (our?) idea of a healthy democracy is incompatible with the constitution. So then we have a problem: either our notion of a healthy democracy is incorrect, or our founding fathers were very incorrect to structure the Senate this way. 

Now, I believe I'm a smart person... but I have more faith in our founders as to what a healthy nation is structured as. They were not always right, but they were right a lot of the time. 

The fact is, if the Senate became representative of ""the people"", then our country would split in two. It's a simple fact. The huge mess of red in the middle (and it *is* huge), would see no reason to participate in a game in which they are consistently a minority and at the mercy of the city-folk. 

We are biased. We (probably?) live in areas that have lots of people and less land. The other team lives in areas with less people and lots of land. We want it to be more about people, and not about land. They maintain that land matters and deserves equal weight. Thus, we have the House (people) and the Senate (land). It's only now that the system appears to be breaking because the majority of people now live in cities or suburbs, and we may be heading for a situation where a consistent majority of people (popular vote) believe one thing, but land is still given equal weight. 

This isn't an easy problem to fix. But we should recognize the result should we misstep: if we don't give land equal weight in representation (the Senate) and mixed weight in the Presidency (electoral college = #reps + #senators), they will see no reason to keep the union together. At that point, the cities either need to dominate the rural areas and control them and force them to accept a new normal in which the rural folks can't win, or the country splits. 

It is impossible to be happy with the current situation, for either side. The rural areas are looking at being a future permanent minority if population shifts continue. They will be completely dominated by the cities and suburbs. This is in addition to the inevitable red to blue shift in raw people numbers and popular vote. The Republicans need to somehow lock in their gains now, either by calling a constitutional convention, overturning some structurally important supreme court cases, or making more restrictive voter laws that are hard to undo. And that's why shit's breaking. One side is fighting for their lives, and playing dirty, and the other is floating ideas like national popular vote that will further minimize the rural areas. Both are looking to structural solutions to lock in their imagined majorities (either in people or land). 

The coalitions and the desire to work together are all at the breaking point, and the game is now switching to finding structural solutions. There's evidence Gorsuch actually wants to reverse one of the One-Man-One-Vote laws, and, for example, allow states to pick their state senate based on land (like the US does) rather than people. 

There are big problems in our future. But they're not because the Senate has equal representation per state. They're much deeper than that. ",1493597003

The point of the drowning was for Sophia to be reborn and set the ritual in the right path, towards vengeance. Why would guardian angel hurt Joseph? I particular disagree because from a religious standpoint, Angels aren't the type to ask for blood. This open to debate. 

In regards to Joseph and his sister, no context is given. This is very ambiguous. 

Was God present? Unsure. We do know demons were present from the very first square. Joseph closed that circle when the floor began to tap. Her guardian angel made his presence known (flowers and gold flakes). One thing for sure, it seems Joseph summon pagan gods as well. Most of the incantations contained Greek/Roman gods. 

Nonetheless, good reasoning. This movie leaves a lot to interpretations. ",1493597006

[Sous Vide Pickled Spring Onions](https://recipes.anovaculinary.com/recipe/sous-vide-pickled-spring-onions) are also a nice touch but are marginally more work.

"FixedGearBicycle","t5_2qo7a","well, first off, people are people and people fuck up. And when you're new its easy to get confused. 

Depending on the shops return/exchange policy and your local laws, that may be the best you can get. If its a local shop, they run things on a shoe string budget and it would really be hard for them to give someone a new frame out of pocket a year after they bought a bike from them, even if the fuck up was on their end. If its a chain store, see about calling their cooperate lines and  maybe they can work a better deal out. One thing is for sure, be understanding, going in yelling at them isn't going to want to make them do any favors for you. 

As far as the nuts digging in the frame, that tends to happen. soft aluminium, steel bolts, one is going to give before the other. Its not going to damage the frame, but might be cosmetically ugly. ( but who the fuck cares, its a bicycle ) If its slipping, you need to tighten the nuts more. 

Seatpost can slip depending on the bike, I'm not sure why they are shimming it assuming the seatpost is the right size for the bike. Unless maybe you're a bigger guy and the seatpost clamp is just a poor design. ( which some bikes have ) but generally, if you tighten the hell out of it, it shouldn't slip. 

As for the sizing mix up, thats a pretty giant fuck up on someones end. But once you took it home, its kinda out of their hands. If you're sized for a 55, I don't even know how someone could ride a 49 without it being nearly painful. I ride a 54 and even on my 51 it can feel a bit small. My outside opinion is how did you not notice something like that sooner? a 49 frame is for someone around 5'0 area, and a 55 would be for someone around 5'9 or higher. Its a huge difference. If you have any paperwork of the serial number that states its a 55, that would be your best proof on a mess up on their end. ( and probably part of the reason why the seat post is slipping if you have it sticking out a foot out of the frame to fit you ) 

If you're having to pay $200+ either way, personally, I'd just cut your loss, and buy yourself a frame such as a crew district or other affordable FG frame. If its a $500 bike, and he is charging $200, basically they are just selling you a new frame and giving you the labor free. Hell, i'd maybe even see if I could sell the bike as is and buy a new complete such as a kilo tt ( $400 ) if that is a way you'd like to go.

Check out to see if there are any other local bike shops, groups, or friends who ride who can move all the parts over to the new frame, and then steer clear of the original shop if you can. ",1493597010
"TrekRP","t5_3elki","The Caitian's jaw shifts into a rather dour expression towards the end of Fisk's lengthy tirade on his feelings regarding the young officer.

""Rrrnm."" is all he says, clearly displeased as this sort of thing is much better explained by fiction.

The next remarks are listened to, but a brown-furred hand is lifted and waved in dismissive fashion.

""If it is what it says on the tin, then what clues it could offer are already wiped clean, and even if it wasn't, I fully expect that the device would not make it to my hand, regardless of the effort made to put it there.   Scan it, study it, backup the findings in a Level 1 security data vault, and store it for when you next dock at a Starfleet facility.""

The Caitian lists forward slightly, exhaling a stiff breath.

""Whatever task Bradley was set out to do are either already complete or will be complete by some other means.  Do not set your guard down, Fisk.  Someone on your ship, which may include yourself, is going to be exploited in a heinous matter.  Take whatever steps are needed to protect them, Starfleet, and the Federation.""

Having another nation's electorate  always deciding (because of sheer size) your Government can only be be borne when the countries are in rough political alignment, but over the last 40 odd years there's been far too many extreme  and repugnant policies imposed,   and far too often what's in Scotland's national interest is simply ignored as the UK Parliament has other priorities it wants to achieve or address.

The Scotland Bill was the last straw for me. The sight of an unholy alliance of Tory and Labour MP's  tearing themselves away from the HoC bars to vote down amendment after amendment after amendment proved that they see Scotland more as a colonial possession than as an allegedly ""equal partner"".

Then there is the imposed  daftness of  Brexit and - again because of extremist attitudes  - a likely 'hard' Brexit at that. 

Instead of being continually unhappy being about governed by governments you didn't necessarily vote for and  have next to no say in, and who have little interest in Scotland,.  and being constantly waiting for the next round of jingoist nonsense to surface,  a simple solution is for the countries to amicably go their separate ways.

Sam and Will have the most coverage responsibility, if Whitehead is there then he will get targeted every time. Putting Davis at Will and JRM/Killebrew at Sam to take over the coverage aspect would let Whitehead do what he does best which is chase and tackle vs the run.

But a story not mentioned as much is Wehrlein not only finishing last but 2 laps down.  Today I couldn't tell if it was the 2016 Ferrari engine or his driving. I just can't make up my mind about him...  
  
Lance Stroll at #11. We gotta give this guy *some* credit, don't we?  He kept it out of  the wall and somehow managed to stay in front of Kvyat in the Toro Rosso.  True he's not proving himself worthy of having a historically top seat. Then again, McLaren-Honda is proving that one's historical standing doesn't mean much if you're not on the track.  Stroll managed to complete his first race.  I think the guy deserves his dad buying him a beer.

In addition to the spells that others have mentioned, I'd suggest Misty Step for a bonus action survivability option if that's up your valley. And as far as Bard spells go, Hypnotic Pattern (2nd lvl) can be really useful. So can Dissonant Whispers (1st lvl) and Heat Metal (2nd lvl).",1493597014

and if you had your earthly power again you will do exactly the same! and you will get it sooner or later.

your teachings are pure blasphemy and you robbed nations and filled your churches with gold and silver. your popes, with all their pomp and luxury, claimed to be gods on earth but none of them can compare to the poor and selfless life of jesus!

learn your history catholics! 

this is not gods church and never will be! i know there are earnest believer in you who love jesus from all of their heart, to them i say, search for the truth, study daniel 2 and 8, study apocalypse, see how your church is described in the holy bible and turn to the only father you need, the one in heaven.",1493597017

I've been a veggie, a low carb diet isn't tolerable as a veggie. I  gave it a go once, too much nut and bean involvement (lectins and  gas) and veg oils aren't great for you because of the O6 content and they don't taste great either. I'm not going to live on avocado alone.

&gt;especially over extremely dangerous 

I'm sorry but that's bullshit. If a low carb diet was a vegan diet you'd have zero issues with it. Humans have evolved to spend months at a time in keto during winter, it doesn't do us any harm. That myth that it does comes from the liquid keto diet they gave to epileptic kids.

And I'm not that exceptional. There are whole ethnic groups that are insulin resistant and have issues with bulk carbs. It's the metabolism for abut 15% of northern Europeans.


Keto diets are beneficial for a lot of people.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/

*The present study shows the beneficial effects of a long-term ketogenic diet. It significantly reduced the body weight and body mass index of the patients. Furthermore, it decreased the level of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and blood glucose, and increased the level of HDL cholesterol. Administering a ketogenic diet for a relatively longer period of time did not produce any significant side effects in the patients.*

There's also a five year long study that found no issues in people following it.

"Filmmakers","t5_2r1ip","I absolutely second the advice about becoming a PA in a production office - or if you've got a bit of experience then applying for Production Secretary jobs (don't be put off by the title - it's basically the Co-ord's right hand person and depending on the size of the team/whether it's TV or film/drama or factual is a great place to start - and I speak from experience!). Anything where you can be around Prod Management is a good place to start. You'll likely overhear a lot of discussions, negotiations, can ask questions - and read contracts and such while you're copying/scanning them. That last point isn't being facetious - being low on the totem pole is where most people start and it's all about making the most of the opportunities that those positions provide.

Google for free crew templates for TV/film, take a look at them and compare them. Familiarize yourself with the common clauses and the language (payment terms/buyouts/NDAs/rights/employment law clauses (depending on where you are - these will vary depending on location obv).

Tax Credits/incentive stuff can get complicated quickly but even so have a look at the US State/Canadian Provincial tax credit websites and see what their main criteria are (usually a certain proportion of your budget spend/proportion of resident labour engaged in the State/Province etc). Again, for things like permits a lot of US Cities/counties have websites with criteria and application forms so you can see what information is needed and what the rules and regs are.

Entertainment law is a bit more difficult to delve into but the main things you can familiarize yourself with are very general principles regarding showing logos/featuring copyrighted works/fictional characters vs depicting real people (both alive and dead)/clearing music etc. Also have a look at E&amp;O Insurance and production insurance in general - it's something a lot of people starting out don't think about - but should!

For budgeting there are so many templates and variations depending on genre and platform - but even so - take a look at any examples you can find. Look at the number of schedules (the 'overall' categories - like Producer/Camera Labour/Camera Equipment/Offline Editing/Online Editing etc etc). Then take a look at the 'line items' (the specifics - DoP/1st Cam Asst/2nd Cam Asst). Get an idea of the big picture and the specifics - big features will likely use most of them (that's not my area of expertise) but in factual TV we use fewer (because our crews are much smaller). If there are terms in there that you're not familiar with then give them a google.

I know your question asked specifically about legal but I'm assuming that you're coming into this fresh so the above is geared towards giving you a general place to start in all these areas. If that's not the case then obv disregard what you already know!

It's nice to hear someone be interested in this aspect of the business, so if you have any questions then feel free to PM me (I'm in TV Prod Mgt).

The American Dream has eluded a German immigrant, after a last ditch effort robbery of a barber shop, an empty pickup truck circles a parking lot aflame, our protagonist takes a solitary ski-lift ride, we watch the lift ascend and a single ominous gun shot rings out, farm animals dance and play piano in little garish glass cases.

Mohumatsu the Rickshaw Man, Toshiro Mifune's character dies in the street after being brushed off by an arrogant young man whom he had taken under his wing throughout his youth.

The climax of Hara-Kiri - after we witness the tragic events that led up to a desperate husband and father's attempt to con a samurai clan into hiring him (which lead to his humiliation and forced suicide), his father in law takes revenge on the clan, slyly and brilliantly exposing their hypocrisy and subsequently killing many in the process only to be overpowered and slain. In montage we see the event is covered up, omitted from the clan's official records. The shamed clan loses no face, the tragedy is lost to history.

Ran - betrayed by his quarelling sons over his throne following his retirement, Tatsuya Nakadai's character, shell shocked and driven mad, slowly descends the steps of a burning castle amidst the throng of his son's assailing army.

The Russian rhoulette scene in the Viet Cong camp in Deer Hunter.

Since this isn't much of a crowdpleaser, I'll tack on that when I was a kid, Arnold's self-sacrifice at the end of Terminator 2 and Mufasa's death in the Lion King were two big ones.

My product routine is, however, very set. I use a turbie twist to get out some of the water, and then I brush with a wet brush. After getting out the knots, I use a dollop of L'Oreal Professionnel's Mythic Oil Creme Universelle and comb that through. I then part my hair and rake and scrunch in three pumps of TIGI Catwalk Curls Rock Amplifier.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; You should be looking at content creators for Youtube or Facebook in comparison to the people who own those companies.

It's an interesting intellectual exercise, but one you're unlikely to get a lot of people to actually respond to.  The income inequality between Pewdiepie (et al) and the CEO of Google is a pretty easy comparison to make, and one which definitely shows inequality, but few are going to have the same visceral reaction to the CEO of Google making more than creators who already make more than enough to live on as they do to the CEO of Walmart making more than his workers who use welfare.

&gt; the path to wealth is paved by government connections subsidizing massive tracts of intellectual property.

I don't mean to be rude here, but I have a pretty solid grasp of intellectual property law and this statement is farkakte.

First, the profits of Facebook and Google (through Youtube) aren't based on owning intellectual property, they're licensing agreements with the people who do own the property.  The only people who could receive a ""subsidy"" for intellectual property would be the people who actually own it.  Youtube does not own a copyright in the videos uploaded to it (it might for Youtube Red content, but that's small potatoes).

Second, what subsidy?  The content creators hold the same copyrights held by every creator in America going back to 1790.  You could argue ""well it's longer now"", but since most of the profit comes from ads from immediate viewership that's complete nonsense.

&gt;the 'knowledge economy' has taken over and create massive fortunes based on enterprises that depend on exploitative labor practices to be viable.

Who is being exploited?  The copyright holders who choose to license to Youtube in order to try to profit from that?

Your ""diagnosis"" relies on the ""exploitation"" of people making a product and then trying to sell it through a market which takes a cut of whatever sales they make.  Is your hypothetical shopkeeper also being exploited if he happens to *rent* his building rather than owning it outright?

So we have a subsidy which doesn't exist given to content creators who are the new robber barons while *also* being exploited by other evil companies who they licensed their copyrighted works to?  Am I getting this right?",1493597030

In the case of the vowel repeater, /a/ on its own is an prefix, which changes a verb to the infinitive form. For example, a word like Anamasus (To Act), would be normally written in blocks as such: /ana.mas.us/, and with the infinitive prefix, it would be written as /a.ana.mas.us/.

In terms of pronounciation, the first /a/ in asa would be stressed after the infinitive prefix. No glottal stop between the /a/ and /asa/. Not too big a fan of those.

"privacy","t5_2qhlc","Normalization. First people celebrate a useful tool, then they accept it as the new normal.

The cloud is useful as a tool, but it has one fundamental problem: centralization, and thus power deprivation of the individual.

Any service or tool not owned by you will not even in the best of circumstances *exclusively* serve your interests; at worst, it might not even primarily serve your interests. When your data is housed online somewhere, you are at the mercy of the provider, and you are subject to their level of concern about protecting customer data.

The good news is that there is a tool that can at least *mostly* protect you: encryption. Encrypt before it goes to the cloud and noone can get at it. However, you could still be *denied* access either by technical problems or by NSL/etc.

The bad news is that the majority of people dont use encryption. This leaves them vulnerable to spying for profit, vulnerable to spying by state level entities, vulnerable to hacks against the cloud provider, and vulnerable to people who have somehow gotten the password to their service.

The cloud is an acceptable tool still... so long as you use an open-source method of encrypting the data before it is uploaded. 

For now, decentralization of this particular service is not as good a solution as using encryption with centralized services. Given all the vulnerabilities in software (tons everywhere discovered and undiscovered), any decentralized option would open your home network to the web- you become the one responsible for proper server security (certainly not something everyone can do). Further, if service providers can get hacked so can the server from your home network- you'd be smart to encrypt data anyway just to be safe.  ",1493597032

"DataHoarder","t5_2x7he","Yeah, I'm similarly unenthusiastic about RAID with drives this large and slow. I feel like RAID beyond mirroring is not the definitive go-to for inexpensive redundant storage it once was, or at least it's certainly not doing it for me anymore. For me personally, I don't feel good anymore about striping my data across multiple drives (regardless of redundancy); I don't need the performance an array could offer because I'm not editing tons of raw uncompressed files, I just need cheap long-term storage with boring speeds, and I'm tired of managing large arrays full of drives with superslow accesstimes. I don't need the redundancy, because it becomes counterproductive with these sizes and speeds, and because I can't trust it anyway. And I'm also trying to get away from the insane noise pollution rather than expanding on it.

That's why I was considering a bunch of RAID1s for my next setup; literally a bunch of individual 2x8TB pairs with LVM to treat them as a single or multiple organized volumes, rather than actually striping data across. Each drive is backed up right away and offers twice the read speed, and can most importantly be shut off when it's not in use, while still being able to read/write data from everywhere else without needing to have multiple drives running. I'm not that crazy about spinning my drives up and down constantly, but most drives would probably be read or written to less than once per day, so I don't think there'd be all that much more wear compared to keeping to the more technically ideal scenario of running them 24/7, and you need secondary backups anyway.

The concrete plan I was considering was mirroring a bunch of 8TBs individually, using LVM to interact with the multiple RAID1s in a sane way rather than having to deal with multiple individual filesystems and mountpoints of course, and then repurposing my older array or the drives in it (9x3TB, which are still too large too feel comfortable with even in RAID6) as a sort of off-site backup solution. So literally multiple individual RAID1s, not a RAID10. I figured this way, I'd have to lose two PAIRED 8TB drives within a day or so before losing any actual data, which seems kinda sorta improbable enough for me; and even then, I could only lose up to 8TB of not-super-important data, because I'd have a backup somewhere else of the most important stuff. Of course it'd suck super hard to lose 8TB of finely organized movies I haven't watched in years, but I'm pretty happy with that ratio of ""probability of data loss/affordability"", and the only data I could actually reasonably lose would be stuff I've deemed expendable; the irreplacable stuff would essentially be saved on 3 drives.

Long-term, I can't form a more coherent plan (for my personal usecase) than multiple RAID1s with 3 drives each, the third ideally being a networkdrive offsite with delayed-write. I haven't looked into unraid, but it sounds sweet; but also not that dissimilar from what I'm planning. I've wondered if there are any obvious flaws with this, investmentwise, but I definitely can't see myself striping actual individual bits across multiple large slow drives ever again, especially not with archive HDDs with horrible speed drops during huge sequential writes. It's loud as hell, and it's also neither cost-effective nor actually redundant anymore. RAID for me is reserved for smaller or faster drives, but I'm lucky enough to not actually need any performance from my large storage anymore.",1493597033

&gt;SHINBO: Although that doesn't mean that there's another story coming; that ending on its own should just be seen as the conclusion to this story. It does seem as if the story has come to an end after achieving a mysterious kind of balance. Considering the fact that it's the sequel to the TV series, it's really not that far-fetched to say that we planned to end that way from the start.

&gt;Urobuchi: It was also the director, Mr. Shinbo's opinion that the outcome of the TV series, ""a human becoming a god"" might be too heavy a fate for a girl in middle school to bear. Since that was the case, I decided to try to come up with a way to create a story in which Madoka could escape that outcome.

Then this interview has Urobuchi explain why the movie was a movie, mostly due the inability to write a full season. He also states when asked if there are differences that there are none at all.

&gt; Rx Bandits is a four-member band based in Seal Beach, California, United States. Their musical style is an eclectic mix of progressive rock, punk, and reggae deemed groove tech by the band.

&gt; The band started out in 1995, amid other popular southern California ska-influenced acts such as Reel Big Fish and No Doubt.  Of the original line-up, only singer/songwriter Matt Embree and drummer Chris Tsagakis remain. Their first two releases were recorded with bassist James Salomone and trombonist Rich Balling. Upon signing to Drive-Thru Records, the band released the album Halfway Between Here and There, a straightforward third-wave ska effort, though lyrics in songs such as ""Gun In Your Hand"" hinted towards the political leanings which would be evident in their subsequent releases.

&gt; They are notable for their strong political views, which they share with fans through periodic website posts.  

&gt; Their live shows are known for being highly energetic, with improvisational jams in between songs. They perform extended versions of many numbers; they fall somewhat short of being a full fledged ""jam band,"" however it is fair to say that they exhibit musicianship live that is not captured by their recordings.

&gt; With 2001's Progress, the band took a huge step forward musically. The incarnation of the band which recorded the album consisted of Embree, Tsagaskis, Balling, Salomone, and current trombonist Chris Sheets. Steve Choi played keyboards on the album, but was not credited as a full member of the band, although he often joined the band on stage. With this album, the band moved beyond playing pure ska. Progress involved elements of punk, reggae, and hardcore punk. Indeed, the band itself notes influences ranging from Fugazi and Bad Brains, to Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, and Toots and the Maytals. The album spawned their only music video, for the song ""Analog Boy"".

&gt; Some time after the release of Progress, Steve Choi was made a full time member of the band, however both Rich Balling and James Salomone left the band. They gained saxophonist Steve Borth, who had played formerly in the popular East Bay ska-punk band Link 80. Bassist Joe Troy, a longtime friend of Embree, joined the band as well to complete their current line-up.

&gt; In 2003, they released The Resignation, a CD/DVD release. The album was recorded live, with the exception of vocals and some overdubs. Embree also shared songwriting duties with Steve Choi, whereas he had previously been responsible for all of the band's material. Also of note is the album cover, which was originally a painting by Aaron Nagel, a Bay Area artist and member of both Link 80 and DESA. Musically, the album continued the genre mixing of Progress and experimented with unconventional time signatures. It again featured overtly political lyrics, evident most obviously in songs such as ""Overcome (The Recapitulation),"" and ""Mastering the List"".

&gt; Since the release of The Resignation, several members have found time for side projects. 
In July 2006 band member Steve Borth left the band to pursue his side project turned main focus, Satori. Embree is involved with his own independent label, MDB Records, as well as his own solo project Love You Moon also contributing to the hip hop group Seekret Socyetee, Coke vs. Bills with Joe Troy, Pebaluna with Lauren Coleman, and Apotheke with members of the Rx Bandits. Steve Choi plays drums in Machines and has collaborated with Asian Man Records founder Mike Park in both The Chinkees and The Bruce Lee Band. Embree and Tsagakis are two of the core members in The Sound Of Animals Fighting.  Tsagaskis is the creative force behind his ambient, electronic project called  Technology.

&gt; On October 10th, 2006 they released the follow-up to The Resignation entitled ""...And The Battle Begun"" 
through Sargent House  / MDB Records. ...ATBB continued to show the changes that the Bandits were making to their sound, adding more elements of progressive rock and funk grooves. Sprawling compositions and virtuoso playing from all the members of the band won the band many new fans, and gained a spot on the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival.

&gt; On July 14th, 2009, they released their latest album, Mandala. The band showed tremendous musical growth since their early 3rd wave ska roots, and Mandala was a true musical force to be reckoned with. Prodigious drumming from Chirs Tsagakis and solid bass grooves from Joe Troy  formed the backbone, while Steve Choi and Matt Embree dueled with noodley guitars and emphatic vocals from Embree. The Bandits had reached a progressive peak, showing that progressive instrumentation could still have soul and feeling, and that a few songs could change a room's demeanor.

&gt; In 2011, the band announced that their summer tour would be their last tour. Despite this, on May 6th, 2013 they announced that they will be embarking on a 10-year anniversary tour for Resignation, and will also be releasing an EP this summer.

&gt; Rx Bandits toured the United States during the summer of 2013 to mark the tenth anniversary of the release of The Resignation. The band released an EP featuring covers of The Police, Blonde Redhead, Weezer, Fugazi, and King Crimson.

&gt;  ""Gemini, Her Majesty"", the bands 7th studio album was released on July 22nd 2014 via (Mash Down Babylon/INgrooves). Produced by Jason Cupp (Maps &amp; Atlases, Birthmark) and recorded at Prairie Sun Recording Studios in Sonoma County, CA, Gemini, Her Majesty is the follow-up to 2009's critically acclaimed release, Mandala.

&gt; ""In the past, our aim was to bridge the gap between our recorded music and our live performance,"" says vocalist/guitarist Matt Embree. ""But this time around we really didn't ever consider that. We almost willingly ignored it. It was really nice to make a record that we didn't apply live performance constraints to. That said, now we're going to have the hefty task of figuring out how we want to arrange and play these new songs live. We love the challenge.""

&gt; Over the course of the past 19 years (yes, 2015 will be their 20-year anniversary), RX Bandits have managed to stay light years ahead of the pack by taking a genre-blurring approach to songwriting. Their adventurous style of play gives them a unique sense of flexibility, one that allows them to seamlessly fit anywhere and everywhere, from the main stage at Bonnaroo and Coachella to Bamboozle and Reading. Their songs have been featured in video games (Guitar Hero, Rock Band), used as the backdrop for ESPN's X Games and continues to be religion for their legion of diehard fans around the world.

&gt; In support of ""Gemini, Her Majesty"" RX took to the road in the summer of 2014 with support from The Dear Hunter and From Indian Lakes. RX Bandits are looking to a stacked 2015 Spring touring schedule with plans to attend the 311 Caribbean Cruise with 311, Pepper and The Dirty Heads, a West coast run in March and a East coast run in early April. The band is also looking forward to touring the UK with Circa Survive in May 2015. Read more on Last.fm.

"NFL_Draft","t5_2t21g","this time of year everything is a projection on where that player could end up if they develop more during their senior year.

None of the QBs next year are #1 pick material right now. not one.

 Darnold throws high way too much and doesn't have great pocket presence. guys who get scared into rolling out too much don't typically do well in the NFL. His footwork is also pretty lazy

Rosen gets tunnel vision when he's about to throw and often doesn't see defenders coming to undercut the route or sack him. He also throws high a lot. 

Browning has consistency issues.

This time last year the top QBs were Kizer, Kaaya and Watson. you saw how that played out once we saw how they developed in their last season.

Allen has his problems just like the rest but he also has some really nice traits. He's got the size and arm strength you want. he makes full field reads. he has the arm talent to make all the throws NFL Qbs need to make. His release is really ffast. 

but his footwork needs help. he needs to get better at judging when to throw a 50/50 ball and when not to. He needs to do a better job looking off the safety and he needs to keep his eyes downfield when the pressure first comes. 

you should also consider the talent of their teammates some. Darnold has a ton of weapons. where Allen was working with non NFL level players. 

I'm not the biggest fan of Allen either but I can see why some like him. he's got a fantastic set of tools. 

Rosen is my guy in this draft because he's the closest to developed to an NFL level but that could easily changed during their last year",1493597040

The girls both had Swedish boyfriends living close by but the beautiful one named Kristin and I still made passionate love anyway. Often she would go out with her boyfriend and they would drink and dance and I could hear her tell him he couldn't come in and that she would see him the next day. Then she would come to my room and shut the door behind her and turn and give that wry smile. 

The sound of the door lock clicking even today excites something deep inside me and takes me back to when life was much different. Back when I didn't have mortgages and loans and kids. Back when the only thing in the world I ever wanted to hear was that door lock and the only thing i ever wanted to feel was her on top of my chest, brushing her hair back and whispering Du Hock Fina Ergon (You have beautiful eyes) in a voice so sultry even today it makes my neck feel wet where her lips were so many years ago.

### Episode 11

So after yesterday's emotionally draining episode we start with a nice peaceful bit of exposition. We learn that Homura is the cause of Madoka's incredibly high potential power, her meddling with timelines causing her to become more and more powerful with each rewind. Of course it's only downhill from here. I was quite shocked to hear Kyubey make the same comparison between livestock and Humans that I made in an earlier thread. I was even more shocked to learn that Human development had been guided from the beginning, simply to function as an energy source for the incubators. It's a nice plot revelation, and of course it baits Madoka into yet another logic vs. emotions debate. Poor Madoka, she really can't seem to catch a break. I'm sure most people would react in a similar way upon learning that human history was effectively a lie, I know I probably would.

Cut to the next encounter between Madoka and Homura and we're treated to more even more emotionally charged dialogue, after yesterday's episode I thought I was braced for this one. Madoka's sincere concern for Homura  almost got the waterworks going for me again. That head tilt/crying combination is an incredibly potent combo :( and Homura spilling the beans and revealing her motives directly to Madoka, I wasn't prepared. 

So after my attempt to think manly thoughts got completely ruined by two crying anime characters again, we're treated to Homura's battle with Walpurgisnacht. What a battle it was. Alas, even Homura's unlimited rocket launcher works wasn't enough to stop the strongest witch. With Homura's defeat (and a little conversation with her mum) comes Madoka's acceptance of her ultimate fate. The entire series has been leading up to Madoka becoming a magical girl (In the present timeline) and the moment is finally here which leads me to...

"StarVStheForcesofEvil","t5_32uti","&gt;I'm sure there's a lot of confusion on what's happened to the old server and what this server is, so I'll tell you what's been going on.

&gt;This started when a bunch of users had gotten fed up with Landin's administration in the old server. We went to Infernape about this, and he said there was nothing we could do. We thought of trying to make a new server, so Infernape let us use one of his old unused servers. We helped to set up the server, trying to improve on the old server's faults, and invited all the people who had issues with Landin. We tried to invite more people slowly, but soon it got out of control and activity was starting to stop in the old server and go on in the new. At this point, everything went a bit crazy with Landin finding out about the new server and everyone wondering what was happening. He was (understandably) angry that we went behind his back like this. Eventually, we talked to him about this, and he told us he was really getting sick of administration, and that he was trying not to let 8 months of work go to waste. We've made our peace with him, and he's a member of this server now with no ill will. We all agreed on shifting to the new server under new administration, as the owner of the previous server was MIA.

&gt;Neither parties in this were completely innocent, and we both made mistakes. This shift could have gone much better, or we wouldn't have had to shift at all, there were many other things we can do. Both sides made mistakes, but it's over and done now, so we're going to try to make the best of this server. There's no longer a divide between both sides, and we will welcome anyone who joins this server.

&gt;What happens now? Well, life goes on in this server now. It's not completely finished, of course, and we're working on that. Mod applications are open until 12PM EST, so if you want to apply, fill in the form above.(edited)

Once upon a time there was an 18 year old man who really *really* loved tractors. He was obsessed, to the point where in his room was filled with posters of tractors. He would buy children's books that had tractors in them, documentaries, anything that had to do with tractors he had it.

Then one day, he met the girl of his dreams. He loved her so much, and she loved him back. After a few months of dating the guy had wanted to take their relationship to the next level. He decided that the next time they were together, he'd take her home with her.

'What if she doesn't like how much I obsess over tractors though?' he thought. He wasn't about to let some silly obsession come between him and his happiness, and like that he was over tractors. He got rid of everything, and when she came over they made sweet love.

Fast forward a few years, they're getting married. It was a big event on a beach. Very expensive. Each and everyone of their family was there. Everyone had dressed in white for the occasion, not to mention the decorations were white as well.

Then all of a sudden the wind picked up. Sand blew everywhere. It was all over the place. Everyone's collective attire and the decorations where ruined. Things seemed pretty bleak.

The man knew what he had to do.

""Whhhhhrrrrrrrr..."" A low sound started to come from the man, and with one big intake of air, he had somehow gotten all of the sand off of everything! The wedding was saved!

""How on earth did you do that honey? You saved the wedding!"" his soon to be wife asked, clearly enamored at this wonderful moment.

""Well you see, the thing is... I'm an extractor fan.""

You're extremely biased and need to take a second to calm down and be a little more rational.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So... When I was 19, I was a terrible person, alcoholic, and freshly moved out of my parents house. I was very much drunk one night texting this girl I went to highschool with. She had moved halfway across the country right after graduation to go live with her biological mom (she was living with a foster family when I knew her). She was telling me that her mom and her had been fighting and that she was kicking her out and that she had no place to go. Being a drunk fucking idiot, I told her that she could come stay with me. Shortly after I passed out.

When I awoke sober and hungover, I saw that I received a text in the middle of the night saying she bought a Greyhound ticket, she'd be at the bus stop here sometime in the afternoon. After I finished freaking out, I told my roommates, who also freaked out.... but it was too late.... She was cute and I was lonely, so I figured what the hell, she can share my bed and we've got plenty of space in the apartment...

So she shows up that afternoon, I go and pick her up, help her bring her stuff into my room, and she says ""I'm gonna get changed."" and before I can even leave the room, she's completely naked,  pulls me onto my bed with her, and tells me to fuck her in the ass. I obliged her, we take a nap, wake up and bang some more, and then fall asleep for the night.

I wake up the next morning to leave for my job at Kmart, open the front door to find an eviction notice. Come to find out, my roommates haven't paid rent in 6 months, and we have 48 hours to vacate. I come home from work and break the news to the girl who just took a 15 hour bus ride away from her broken home who's ass I came in that she has to leave because we're being evicted. Some friend she had from highschool came and picked her up from my place, and I've never heard from her again.

"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","To argue that first line, their are schools of thought out there who see autism/aspergers not as a disorder but just a different way of thinking with its own advantages (I'm not well versed in that subject so I'm not the best person to ask. It would make sense though because some people I've met on the spectrum definitely have more intellectual capability than normal people).

In terms of liberal stance, it depends (not every liberal/republican is the same. Most people learn via their communities, it's not like theirs ""one"" memo everyone gets). Most incest cases are consenting, loving cases, imho, a lot of them are born through abuse. Abuse isn't love. Maybe their are some loving, consenting incest couples, but I don't agree with it from a biological perspective that there would be fucked up children. You don't get fucked up children from LGBT parents just because the parents are LGBT (it would be from if the parents themselves were lacking parenting skills).

Why should straight people get a tax cut? To be honest, I have people in my family who are relationship psychologists, and I too have studied the history of marriage in the states, so I do feel a little bit more qualified than you to state that marriage hasn't always fit the mold it does now. In previous generations it was strictly to bore children to work the farms/maintain the house, and also to bridge royal families/leaderships, then the idea of love was introduced into marriages. The idea of marriage has changed and bent more than you think. I don't think heterosexuals should get a tax cut if homosexuals are denied the same thing.

History does not support your claim. Neither do any of the links you provided.

The tactic was a rousing success and it almost put an end to Marijuana use altogether. 

It wasn't until some beatniks stumbled upon a wild mother in full maturity and using their training they plucked, dried, and smoked that plant.

The Ganja transformed them and they became what we now call ""hippies"". 

The new hippie way spread throughout the population like a tactical virus. Eventually the alarm was raised by President Richard Carter who after sniffing too much cocaine made being a hippie illegal. These were dark days for the movement and it almost seemed over. That was until the glorious Reagan Revolution.

Can you tell me why you seem to know for sure that Cosby gave the drugs to the women without their knowledge? Or is that just some assumption you made?

Here's some text from [this article](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/07/us/bill-cosby-quaaludes-sexual-assault-allegations/):

&gt;While Cosby admitted that he acquired seven prescriptions of Quaaludes with the intent to give the sedatives to young women he wanted to have sex with, he has not admitted to actually drugging any of his accusers.

&gt;While Cosby's attorneys cite two women who ""allegedly say that they knowingly took Quaaludes offered to them by Defendant in the late 1970's"" -- one of them being former model Theresa Serignese, who has shared her accusations publicly -- they do not address the numerous women who say they were given pills for a variety of reasons, including to ""cheer up.""

Then the city itself (my phone can't fix my terrible spelling of Rikavik) is just touristy crap expensive shops and a big church. Really just a town, not a city. 

Afterwards we learned we should have rented a car to drive ourselves around (and spend enough time to do this) and gone to the grocery store for food (restaurants are crazy expensive). So mostly we just did stuff all wrong. Still no real interest in going back. I would rather spend another day in London or Amsterdam. ",1493597059

A power of attorney (POA) or letter of attorney is a written authorization to represent or act on another's behalf in private affairs, business, or some other legal matter, sometimes against the wishes of the other. The person authorizing the other to act is the principal, grantor, or donor (of the power). The one authorized to act is the agent or, in some common law jurisdictions, the attorney-in-fact (attorney for short).

The Belief Aqua bomb was good at first, but it just dried me out. I do like Jojoba oil, but it's not a quick sink into your skin. The 3 that work really well for me are: DermaE hydrating Day Cream (it doesn't play nice under makeup though) and it is in a jar so I personally suggest a scooper, Naobay Oxygenating Cream (this is soooo good and plays really well with makeup and sunscreen), and a heavier lotion that I wouldn't use everyday, but works great with my face is Les Couvent des Minimes Loving Care Face Cream for sensitive skin. It does have a scent, but I find it very pleasant. It's kind of like honey and fresh flowers, but it dissipates. It has been pretty magic on healing scabby or dry acne. I've been working very hard to rehydrate my skin. I also use 100% pure hyaluronic Acid after I wash my face. It can dry you out so I suggest putting it on after you wash your face (keep it wet) and then locking it in with a moisturizer on top (I've been using my loving care). It helps heal spots faster. I also have switched from using an AHA or BHA everyday (which was great for a year and then too much) to once or twice a week at night. And I've been drinking tons of water (take your body weight and half it to get an idea of your oz. I personally have to drink way more; I drink a gallon of water and then about 32 ounces of an electrolyte drink. I've always required extra hydration... just had my blood tested and I'm healthy, so I can't say why. It's helped with my skin hydration). Good luck! ",1493597060

&gt;The contradiction is clear, and absolute. If the Catholic Church has become one of Islam’s loudest boosters, then those who are aware of the nature and magnitude of the jihad threat, rooted in Islamic texts and teachings, have to make some decisions about where they stand.

&gt; John Craigie is an American singer-songwriter. He has been hailed as a ""Modern-Day Troubadour"" in the style of Woody Guthrie and Ramblin' Jack Elliott.

&gt; Over the years, Craigie has taken his unique musical style across the western United States.  He stays true to the essence of folk music, and the traditions of the seminal writers of our past century. With timeless melodies and insightful lyrics—interspersed with witty storytelling—his songs take many poetic turns before bringing you back home. His themes range from social commentary to personal empowerment,  political satire, and modern love. Craigie writes, sings, and plays for the people.

&gt; The story of Craigie’s first album begins with a new folk singer on the scene in Santa Cruz, CA, with seven years of songwriting pent-up in a 23 year old brain and a 6 year old guitar. In an attempt to put these songs down on disc, Craigie found himself in the middle of the woods, outside of Santa Cruz, in a one-room studio that also served as a recording studio. With the help of the very eccentric owner of the studio, in about three days, john had laid out over 20 songs. Satisfied with the sound john grabbed the rough mixes and began to pass it around to listeners and fellow musicians. Packaged in a home-made sleeve and case, “I always –ed you” became Craigie’s first album before he got a chance to change anything. It was too late. The response was huge and the demand for the raw sound kept it untouched. Still packaged in the same home-made style, it remains as one of john’s most beloved albums. Like most debut albums, it reflects the innocence and the honesty of a musician’s first step on his/her path.

Thanks to PtV, Contessa is effectively omniscient with regards to achieving victory. Any weakness, any kryptonite, any chink that exists in a conceptual defense, her power knows about and will exploit. If a MGs powers rely on being happy, she'll use Excalibur's Madness Wavelength to get her angry. At which point she'll behead her. If a MGs powers rely on feeling righteous zeal, she'll act like a scared puppy until Contessa's opponent is reminded of her dead younger brother. At which point she'll behead her. If there's anything a MG's powers are fuelled by, she'll deny it to them. Etcetera, etcetera. Since almost all magical girls can be communicated with or influenced in some way, almost all of them can be manipulated.

"berkeley","t5_2qh9w","I heard that 140 is strict about the Data 8 prereq (even if you have basic programming and stat experience), so you'd need to take that first (summer maybe?). Idk who's teaching Stat 140 in fall, but the person who is teaching it now (Adhikari) is fantastic, but tough. She used to teach 134, I don't think she would go any easier on 140 students and I'm sure the class is curved similarly to stat 134 (check berkeleytime.com for stat 134 grades)

That cc class sounds like it taught you more than what most people would go into stat 134 knowing. But I can't tell you if you have a good enough intuitive understanding of the concepts in order to apply them to diff situations (I would recommend you take a look at least the first 5 ch of the stat 134 book: Probability by Jim Pitman).

Are you a transfer? I get that concern completely. What course load you should take depends a lot on how much you want to try to get involved in berkeley in the fall (are going to go do internship recruiting ?, are you looking to socialize and explore berkeley a lot?, do you want to join a club?), how easy it is for you to adjust to a new environment, and how good you are at picking up on math/stat concepts (good study skills help, but some people are just naturally smart here and you are competing with them). Personally, I was dealing with some other personal issues during my first semester, so I decided to wait till my second semester. I know transfer stat majors who got grades ranging from B- to A+ in stat 134 so it just depends on the person, how easy ur CC classes were, and your luck.",1493597062

Moved from that to rewatching **GITS: SAC** to fill the gap. One of the first series I ever watched after the first Toonami era ended and still enjoy it immensely.

Also in the middle of the **Monogatari** rewatch and it's always fascinating to follow along, pick up new things, and watch first timer reactions.

Finished watching **Watamote** with my wife. We recently finished **Himouto Umaru-Chan** and she wanted to watch a comedy. Boy, this was painful to watch! Everything about her life is absolutely brutal and difficult to watch. To make it worse, I found the main character to be almost completely insufferable. Between Umaru and Tomoko, I think no kids are in our future.

Started watching **Ground Control to Psychoelectric Girl**. Talk about another sad story. But at least this woman has a reason for her problems. Only on episode 3 at the moment.",1493597062

I was walking through the woods when I was about 12, and ran into a spider web. During the flailing whirlwind of panicky ""GTFO ME"" dance I was doing, I felt something crawl into my ear.

It was the spider. I knew it. I could hear it rustling around in there, and tried with all my might to get it out, but it just receded further. Inside my *fucking head*, making little scraping sounds.

20 hours it was in there. 20.

I was at camp when this happened, and no one believed me. They took me to the nurse on staff and she looked in it with one of those little ear scope things, and didn't see anything.

20 hours.

A few times during this horrible adventure, it would start to crawl out. I could both hear, *and feel* it attempting to make its escape from the inside of my body, and each time my initial reaction was to try and grab at it, smash it, anything. Each time this just made it recede again.

Woke up the next day, and could still feel and hear it scratching around in there. Then, I felt it trying to get out again. I resisted the urge to once again jam my finger in my ear, and instead got my flashlight (it was very early in the morning, very dark still).

I yelled ""EVERYONE LOOK."" and shone the light at my ear with my head tilted, ear facing downward, and from a single gossamer thread the spider made its descent. From ear to floor, it slowly dropped as the rest of the campers, and counselors who refused to believe my plight looked on, the sounds they made slowly turning up in volume as they watched.

Fucking terrible 20 hours man, I was convinced I had spider eggs in my brain for a few weeks and expected something like that one awful ""Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark"" bit where the girl has spiders burst out of her face in the night. It never happened.",1493597064

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","So, Estonia is the first country in the world to declare internet a human right, in 2000 and it is the first country in the world to have online elections (e-voting) in 2005. How the hell is that not being a pioneer? It literally fits the definition. I just copy-pasted a few chapters from the article I gave you a link for before:

Given Estonia’s history, the invention of Skype in this country was ironic. While Americans were buying their first cell phones, about a quarter-century ago, Estonians were shut off from the world as an outpost of the Soviet Union. You could easily wait 10 years to be assigned a landline phone. By the time the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, the country was in a time warp. “We did not have anything,” says Gen. Riho Terras, the commander of Estonia’s armed forces, who had been a student activist at the time. The country had to reboot from zero. Terras says each citizen was given the equivalent of 10 euros, or $10.60. “That was it,” he says, laughing. “We started from 10 euros each.”
One generation on, Estonia is a time warp of another kind: a fast-f orward example of extreme digital living. For the rest of us, Estonia ­offers a glimpse into what happens when a country abandons old analog systems and opts to run completely online instead. That notion is not fanciful. In various forms, governments across the world, including those in Singapore, Japan, and India, are trying to determine how dramatically they can transform themselves into digital entities in order to cut budgets and streamline services (and for some, keep closer tabs on citizens). Estonia claims its online systems add 2% a year to its GDP.

The moment I land in Tallinn, my phone pings with the city’s free Wi-Fi network, which rolled out more than 15 years ago. But the extreme-digital life of regular Estonians is far less visible. At birth, every person is assigned a unique string of 11 digits, a digital identifier that from then on is key to operating almost every aspect of that person’s life—the 21st-century version of a Social Security number. The all-digital habits begin young: Estonian children learn computer programming at school, many beginning in kindergarten.
In 2000, Estonia became the first country in the world to declare Internet access a basic human right—much like food and shelter. That same year it passed a law giving digital signatures equal weight to handwritten ones. That single move created an entire paperless system. Since no one was required to sign with a pen, there was no need for paper documents to pay taxes, open a bank account, obtain a mortgage, pick up a prescription, or perform most of life’s other tasks, other than marrying and divorcing. “I established my company in about 20 minutes, without going anywhere,” says Kaidi Ruusalepp, 41, CEO of Funderbeam, an investment t rading platform for early-stage, non-IPO startups, which she founded in 2013. “We never visited the tax board, the Social Security agency, anything,” she says. “Everything is online.”

So, too, are Estonians’ taxes. Almost all Estonians file taxes online—within minutes. Since public registries are all linked in one system, Estonians can log in to prefilled tax declarations showing their income, property, number of children, and so on. They make necessary tweaks and hit the send button. (Outside the U.S., this type of approach is increasingly common.) Last year then–Prime Minister Taavi Rõivas earned loud cheers on The Daily Show when he described to host Trevor Noah how he had filed his taxes on his iPad during a few idle minutes in the Luxembourg Airport.
When I visit Rõivas, 37, in his office in the Estonian Parliament, it’s weirdly devoid of paper. He says during nearly three years as Prime Minister the only time he signed his name in ink was in ceremonial guest books. Theoretically, he says, the government could issue an online order to send troops into battle. “I never signed any law physically,” he says. “Never.”
Estonians were also first to be able to vote online in elections, back in 2005. When I ask Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid where she voted in last November’s elections, which brought her to power, she responds as if my question is dumb: “From my computer at home.” Kaljulaid was ­speaking to me while we were on a boat to Tallinn from Helsinki, in neighboring Finland, where she had just signed a deal allowing the countries to recognize each other’s digital ID cards. Now, for example, Finns and Estonians can visit doctors in the other country and automatically call up their medical records—all stored online. “We have been using digital identifiers for 17 years,” she says. “People have learned to trust the system.”",1493597064

I don't know how bad your autism is but in my experience alot of it is really simple things that off put people. How you wave, your tone when you say hi, how you normally shape your sentences, etc. 

Those things aren't going to be fixed by any book or general help from people online because anyone writing those things take your difficulties for granted. 

What I would do is find someone who's really willing to be extremely critical of all your regular gestures, and for you yourself to be willing to accept them. It will feel unnatural, but unfortunately that's autism. I would hope with practice it becomes habit for you though :) 

EXAMPLE
The person with autism I helped, when he would say hi. Like ""Hi Mike"". He would say the entire phrase just too long with alot of change in tonality. That's weird, I taught him to say it more quickly, and with a normal change in tonality. The normal tonality is just a small shift from high to low between the two words.  ",1493597065

I just finished a mostly T8 game in my Molotov, and while I died (as is customary) I did 40k damage and defended a cap point from advancing enemies with the support of a New Mexico for the entire game. I am running it with the concealment skill, which absolutely saved my arse when a Scharnhorst decided he didn't like the look of me. The Molotov is *not* a stealthy ship, which compounds it survivability problems. Basically just try to put yourself in the enemy's shoes and imagine which ship on your team they would focus fire - if looks like you, fall back. Let a BB or CA take the punishment, retreat a bit and lob 180mm into someone's broadside halfway over the other side of the map.

Matched with guy while out drinking on Friday night with a friend, he was funny and actually made conversation, yay. I felt a bit bad though, I wasn't in much of a position to text much that night. He gave me his number and asked for a date the next day after some more texting. Cool, I appreciate it when guys offer a concrete plan date ie. time, place and activity. Didn't hear much from him Saturday to Thursday (the day of the date), is that really that common? Set up a date then don't text? I find it a bit annoying, oh well.

Date itself was a bit confusing. He was 25 minutes late but was coming from work and it was raining in peak traffic so no worries there. We seemed to get along well, had a bunch in common and no awkward silences. He definitely talked the majority of the time which is fine I'm a bit more introverted anyway. Went for a walk after dinner and stopped for a bit at this bar playing live music. That's were it got kind of awkward, we were sitting at a right angle and he continues to talk about his job, but doesn't look at me at all for an entire conversation. He's just looking straight ahead. That felt a bit off-putting. We left and he walked me to the bus station, awkward hug good-bye, though he maybe lingered a bit on the hug? Anyways I actually liked this one except for the weird no looking at me for awhile thing. Would like to see him again, but somehow and I don't know how, must have messed it up because I'll never hear from him again.


Met another new guy for breakfast on Saturday morning. He was nice and talkative but there was nothing else there, no connection whatsoever. It was just a pleasant friendly breakfast.

Hung out with a friend that is a few years younger drinking and playing video games and crashed at his place on Saturday night. Was supposed to take my mind off of failed tindering for a few hours. Instead the friend did a feelings dump on me while I was there, drunk. Lost a friend cause that was super awkward and uncomfortable.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Ok so, no.

A) Your article is talking about domestic abuse when it comes to partners, not children. There's no actual statistic or graph or study that talks about gay couples and how they treat their children.

B) What your article actually talks about is the abuse men get, and not only gay men. A big reason for this domestic violence is because hot lines would hang up on anybody seeking help that were male. And there's a social stigma around the fact men can't be abused. Compiling that with the added social pressures and negative effects that are caused from people hiding who they really are and it causes the worst in people.

C) This article is outdated and is mainly talking about 2014, where at the time only one state, Massachusetts, had legalized gay marriage. They also mention that because of that domestic abuse, as well as the environment in general, had gotten much better for gay people. Keeping in mind that gay marriage was legalized across the US, it's entirely possible that domestic abuse problems have significantly decreased. 

4) Your point makes no sense if you change gay to white or any other race or minority. If white people statistically abused children more would we not allow them to have or adopt children? I think not, in fact, I'm pretty sure that would go against our very constitution. 

Conclusion: If you're going to post an article, post one that is relevant to today and actually relevant to the topic and isn't you twisting what the article really means. Because the article makes no mention that gays shouldn't be able to adopt and provides no proof of gay couples abusing their children anymore then straight couples. Or talks about children much at all besides the interview(?) portion. You can't post something like this and say its not 'in the child's best interest' when the article itself literally does not support that argument. The article is also remarkably positive about things improving, contrary to your statement.",1493597072

Emery was GM to a team that went 10-6, 8-8, and 5-11.  He netted us Jeffery, Long, Marshall, Bennett, Slausen, Bushrod, Willie Young, Fuller, Charles Leno, and role players like Sutton and Lamarr Houston. 

Pace has gotten us a few decent pieces but folks are so quick to shit on Emery when he put together a team that was #2 in offense (behind the Manning Broncos) and just in need of some defensive help.

"adultsurvivors","t5_2ub55","I am sorry that you were sexually abused. I was similar to you, but it was serial monogamy and I was the one typically used.

You've taken the first step by admitting you have a problem. The next step is to go see a therapist on how to learn new strategies for dealing with life and to forget your self destructive ones. This is why I'm a big advocate of seeing a psychologist over a psychiatrist because the latter expects you to find your own answers. ;)

By recognizing your self destructive behaviors, it's time for you to modify them. Speaking as a 47 year old male survivor, I do not want you to go through what I did when my ex-wife hid my daughter from me for 14 years and did parental alienation. I wasn't the one that cause our marriage to go south; it was her and me finding her having sex with my dad is what did it. The last thing I want any father to go through is the pain of never knowing your child(ren) are alive and if someone else is called daddy. I'm a grandfather now, but I will never see my grandchild or my daughter ever again. 

Change your behaviors and be the best darn husband and father you can be. The other option is the worst path that any father can tread and it's a lonely one.

God bless you and yours. I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. :) ",1493597079

&gt; As the legal economy withered, drugs, crime and despair moved in. Many of the people who could afford to sell their homes left the city.

&gt; From 1970 to 1990, the white population in Milwaukee declined by a third, falling from more than 600,000 to just under 400,000. In some areas on the north side, including neighborhoods once served by Samuel Clemens school, the number of white residents fell by more than 90%. Many moved to the suburbs of Waukesha, Washington and Ozaukee counties where the population grew more than 30% in that 20-year span. 
&gt; 
&gt; Many African-American workers, who had only recently purchased their homes, saw them fall in value to below what they owed on the mortgage loans. The homes were not building equity, which might be used for home improvements and repairs, or to get through a difficult time, or to help the kids through college.

Of course, I'm still happy they haven't banned more cards. Regarding the P9, I wouldn't mind people in my playgroup playing them.

Of course, things are different for the new 1on1 league format, which I am expecting to be played in paper as well. The P9 would provide too much of an edge there. I would be against banning Crypt and Cradle respectively, though. I don't fancy playing Singleton Modern.",1493597081

"52book","t5_2s935","This Week I Finished:

**The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett:** As a young girl, I was obsessed with this book and **A Little Princess** by the same author. They are both stories about young girls whose parents die and who are thrown into miserable circumstances, but then find new and loving families through virtue of their own unique personalities. When I was twelve, my mother and I went to New York and saw the musical version of The Secret Garden, and I have been listening to the soundtrack on a regular basis for the twenty years since (look, sometimes you just need to sing both parts of ""Lily's Eyes"" at the top of your lungs to get through cleaning the bathroom--my apologies to my neighbors). Now the touring company is coming to my city and my mom and I are going to see it again, so it seemed like a perfect time to reread it. I didn't realize how much of the musical was pulled directly from the book, so there were tons of lines that had me singing (again, sorry to anyone who had to listen). I really enjoyed the first half of the book, where petulant little Mary Lennox learns that she's not the center of the universe and begins to care about the people around her. Then cousin Colin comes in. He's annoying in the musical, but I somehow forgot that in the book he's not only annoying, but that he essentially takes over the plot during the whole second half of the book. Mary, who previously had been delightfully selfish and forthright, is relegated to his biggest cheerleader. I try not to judge historical novels through a modern lens, but it's hard to watch Colin go on about how he's going to be an athlete and a scientist and a religious leader while Mary and the servants just stare at him, awed by his ability to do things like stand and walk, and *not* reflect on white/male/class privilege. In my mind I've always thought of this as Mary's story, so it was a bit disappointing to go back and see that Colin might actually get  more attention in the book. However, I still really enjoyed the language and descriptions of the wild moor, and I particularly enjoyed listening to it in the past week, as all the trees and flowers are blooming around me. My warm nostalgic feelings about this book remain, although I'll probably stick to listening to the musical from here on out. 

**Forbidden by Beverly Jenkins:** When I first got into romance novels, Beverly Jackson was a pretty big name, but I never read her books because I don't really go for cowboy/Old West romance. The covers were memorable, however, because they frequently featured black women, which was a rarity at the time. A while ago I watched a documentary called ""Love Between the Covers"" about romance novels and the culture surrounding them, and y'all, I fangirled so hard. Nora Roberts! Jennifer Crusie! Kristan Higgins! Eloisa James! Beverly Jenkins was also featured, so I pulled up my trusty Overdrive and ordered this book. This book is set primarily in Virginia City, Nevada in the 1870s or 1880s. Eddy Carmichael is a black woman trying to get from Denver to California who makes some rather desperate travel choices that leave her stranded in the middle of the desert. She's saved by Rhine Fontaine, a former slave who is now passing for white and has become one the the foremost citizens of Virginia City. He's impressed by her pluck, she's impressed by how handsome he is, so on and so forth. The romance isn't particularly hot or satisfying, and both characters are sort of irritatingly upright and moral. Frankly, the only thing I really found interesting about this book was the historical context. There's a lot of discussion about the rift in the Republican Party at the time about whether abolition actually meant desegregation, especially given that blacks still lacked legal and financial power but their post-Emancipation voting bloc had helped put many Republicans in office. I've never read anything that focuses on Reconstruction politics in the Old West, so that part was interesting, even if it was delivered in bulky, inelegant chunks. I was blaming some of these issues on the book being written twenty years ago, but it turns out that this is Jenkins' come-back book--it was published in 2016. I'll read more of this author, just because I'm curious what other stories she might tell.

**You Are Not So Smart: Why You Have Too Many Friends on Facebook, Why Your Memory Is Mostly Fiction, and 46 Other Ways You're Deluding Yourself by David McRaney:** This is basically a pop-psychology bathroom book.

If conservatives wanted to live in a bubble away from liberal opinions, we'd have small schools like Hillsdale, one news channel and a few actors and entertainers we could watch. If the left wanted to live in a bubble, they'd largely carry on as they normally would, because they're likely already boycotting Fox News and Clint Eastwood movies. The left has such a stranglehold on aspects of the culture like entertainment, media, and academia that their ideas are all the ""mainstream"" in those fields. 

This asymmetry (that conservative *have* to be exposed to and deal with liberals, but not necessarily vice versa) may very well be a contributing factor to the right's greater tolerance, but the problem extends far beyond just college. I know of far more liberals that I'd be less comfortable expressing a dissenting opinion in front of. Hypothetically, would you rather tell one of your conservative friends that you're pro-choice, or one of your progressive friends that you believe in traditional marriage?

65 points.

&gt; We will finish this season with more points.

And so will every team in the top 7 except Arsenal. Consider it inflation. It's nothing special if your relative position doesn't change within the general league inflation. We've improved the least. 

&gt; We have scored more goals in 34 games than we did in 38 last season. Our offence is better

Actually, it's not. Our conversion rate is worse. We've scored more goals but have had to take almost double the amount of shots to accomplish that. So yes, we've scored more goals, but our efficiency is worse. No top team deals in poor efficiency. 

&gt; If we concede less than 10 in the next 4 games (very likely) our defence will be better. So our defence has improved.

good. 

&gt; We have two opportunities for champs league. It is possible we finish the season with 2 trophies and champs league.

This was the exact same case until we lost to Liverpool and West Ham. Nothing has changed. 

&gt; More goals. More points. Less goals conceded. What's the issue?

Less points against top teams, worse home record, more draws at OT than ever before. More draws than any other team in the league. Worse relative to other top teams in the league. 

Everything is relative. It's easy to drop all those facts and say we're doing better, but when compared to the remainder of the league, and other factors, not so much. You're comparing to a season in which we had 14 injuries at the same time, and didn't have 4 of the most impactful players this season. Yet the differences isn't as marked. 

Take for example the simple fact that Valencia was out for 1/2 of last season and has barely been out this season. That completely changes the relative context of our defensive performance. We conceded 35 goals with Blind and Smalling and a mixture of youth fullbacks all season. Compared to Rojo, Bailly, Valencia, Jones and Blind this season. We played games with Blind and Carrick at CB and Fosu Mensah/Varela and CBJ at fullbacks yet kept 17 clean sheets and conceded the same as spurs. We're doing relatively similar with a far more solid defensive unit. To me, last season seems more impressive. ",1493597089

The reason to use passive skills is to speed along gameplay, so you aren't doing a bunch of rolls and having to spend the time doing the arithmetic. 

When you design a dungeon crawl for your players and you put a trap in there, you know the passive perception for all your players. Say your players have passive perception of 14, 14, 14, and 18. Why bother putting in a trap that requires a DC of 17? You know the players are automatically going to find it. So now you've wasted time describing a thing which isn't really a problem. The whole point of passive perception is to save time, but instead it just leads to excess talking by the DM for no gain. No interesting challenge has been created.

If you don't start working on your pronunciation now, then you'll never be ready for iTalki conversations, no matter how much vocabulary and grammar you have.

At your stage I would recommend 50% pronunciation, 25% vocabulary, 25% grammar. Keep the 10 words/day, Duolingo, and journaling. That will take care of all your vocabulary+grammar development. Drop the grammar lessons and podcasts. Replace them with minimal pair activities, phrasal shadowing, and work on singing an easy French song. It's better to delay the grammar lessons and podcasts until later, when you're better equipped to learn French grammar in French, instead of being forced to learn about French grammar from English translations.",1493597092

In the end, I decided to go with the cheapest possible option, and to not buy any ""extras"" (souvenirs, beer, extra activities) while there. In that way I knew that I had at least minimized the amount of money my visit brought to the government. 

In retrospect, I really can't see how they made any money on me at all. They even had a camera man follow us for the entire week or so we were there, filming us at all times. He edited a DVD of our visit that we could buy at the end of the tour. I think maybe two copies were sold. That's not a substantial income for a week of work, with lots of overtime. You could argue that maybe the guy couldn't have done anything more productive during that week, but I seriously doubt that his resources could not have been used better elsewhere. 

Anyway, compared to the real money earners of North Korea, tourism is a drop in the ocean. I think that when I looked at the numbers and realized that, that's when I decided it would probably be okay to go, ethically. Especially because some of the people who have escaped North Korea have said that they encourage a little bit of tourism to the country, as it leads to more openness and knowledge about the conditions in the country, and they think it's a good think.

However it's written in this style that's really unappealing, where lines are constructed by matching the sounds of previous lines and not because they are actually the right things to say in any sense. This works better  in the context of a song where the charms of the performance or the instrumental can cover for the fact that basically nothing is being said. Usually though, at least for the people who are really good at writing in this mode (I'll put Doom here), one manages to have many individual lines that are funny or interesting or otherwise compelling: this piece falls down there.

So the content here is basically nonsense with nothing much worth remarking on. The structure is even more bizarre. I cannot make anything of stanzas 4-8 just being the same lines haphazardly repeated -- it honestly reads like the author was wasting time to hit a word count.

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","&gt;&gt;I'm still skeptical. I can see a company like Google notice the trend of programmable blockchains, and want to make sure they'll end up as the market leader in blockchain technology. I'm aware that they cannot recreate an ecosystem the size of Ethereum's overnight, but I can imagine that if their interest is big enough, they have the resources to completely overtake Ethereum, hear me out. My argument relies on the assumption that Google has a serious interest in becoming the blockchain market leader, and has a respectable budget available to reach their goal. I'm not sure what kind of a budget this would require, but I believe Google has enough money to achieve the strategy.

Let's look at Ethereum. 

- Is it underfunded? Absolutely not.
- Are developers as a whole seeking to leave Ethereum? Absolutely not.
- Are devs receiving adequate funding to build atop Ethereum? Absolutely.
- Is Ethereum paving the way in smart contract tech, and doing things no other devs can just ""copy and paste"" to start doing on their own without Ethereum (i.e. code their own PoS client in place of Casper)? Absolutely.

So with all these things considered, why on earth would a majority of devs leave Ethereum for another blockchain startup operation? They're already leading the charge in this revolutionary tech. It's already far too lucrative and already has an entire alliance of companies as big as Google helping develop it (Microsoft Azure anyone). It's doing just fine luring in enterprise attention, and does NOT need the public at all -- the public can use Ethereum based dapps without needing to know they are using Ethereum (so Google appealing more trustworthy to Joe Schmoe is a virtual non factor). 

I think the concern is if Google develops something better, not if it tries to hijack Ethereum and its platform.

"LawSchool","t5_2rb9g","**Community Property** – All earnings and all property acquired with earnings during marriage becomes Community Property. It's automatic, so the spouses don't have to choose (and don't get to choose) whether to put it into marital property like in common-law states. Everything owned by spouses before marriage or granted to a spouse by gift or devise is separate property and not part of community property. On divorce, community property is split EQUALLY. On death, each spouse gets 1/2 of the community property.

&amp;nbsp;

**Separate/Common Law Marital Property States** – Different rules in different states as to what actually counts as marital property (for purposes of divorce and death), but if it's a common-law state that still recognizes Tenancy by the Entirety, both spouses have to proactively put property into TBE (usually the family home). On divorce, there is EQUITABLE division of marital property, which, depending on the state either is all property owned by the spouses, property acquired during marriage (by any means), or sometimes only property acquired with earnings during marriage (same approach as Community Property states). Today, EQUITABLE division usually means EQUAL division, though, so really the main difference between Community and Common-Law Property states is what is included in the martial estate. On death, in many Common-Law Property states, the surviving spouse can exercise his/her Elective Share, which is typically 1/2 or 1/3 of all of the decedent's property (real and personal) owned on death.

&amp;nbsp;

**Migrating Spouses** – Marital property is characterized by the state in which it was acquired. So you could potentially end up in big trouble if you move from a CL Property state with an elective share to a Community Property state, because none of your property will exist as Community Property to be divided on death. You could go from automatically getting half of your spouse's estate by statute to nothing.

Inflation is the measure of the increase in the price of goods from year to year. There is no such thing as a single inflation number; it is an estimate.

The problem is that the idea that incomes have only gone up by $3900/year since 1990 is an obvious lie, and is really a great indication of why the CPI (which is the metric in this case) is garbage.

So here's the deal: there are multiple inflationary indicies. CPI and IPD are two of the better known ones - the Consumer Price Index and the Implicit Price Deflator. They're calculated by different government agencies for different purposes; the IPD is the inflation adjustment used to calculate productivity increases, for instance.

The problem is that neither inflationary index is actually designed to measure long-term inflation. CPI, for instance, is calculated on a month to month basis; long-term inflation is simply ""calculated"" by multiplying together smaller changes and getting a bigger one.

The problem is you can't actually do this; it leads to wildly inaccurate results.

The reason is that inflation is calculated by taking a bundle of goods at one point in time, then taking that same bundle of goods at another point in time and calculating how much the price of that bundle of goods has changed. Obviously, your choice of goods in said bundle of goods affects the calculated inflation rate, as does your weighting of the prices of said goods.

The problem is that when you start looking at long periods of time, you come to the obvious and immediate realization that you cannot actually do this. While a bag of rice is a bag of rice, a car is not a car; a car from 1970 is not equivalent to a car from 1990, which is not equivalent to a car from 2017.

This is one of the ways in which things go completely wrong. The average price of a car has approximately doubled since 1990. But if you compare a 1990 car to a 2017 car, the 1990 car is vastly worse. If you look at the bottom level 2017 car, the cheapest one - the Nissan Versa - it is a vastly better car than the equivalent 1990 cars. Indeed, if you compare it to equivalent vehicles from 1990, you find that you simply cannot get a vehicle with a lot of its features from 1990 because they didn't *exist* yet.

The 1991 Geo Metro LSI had worse features and yet still cost $11,121 for something with [pretty minimal features](https://www.cars.com/reviews/los-angeles-timess-view-1420689068837/) - fewer than even a bottom-rung vehicle like the Versa has today.

The 1990 Ford Festiva was cheaper but was even more lacking. At $7,750, it *is* appreciably cheaper… but it doesn’t include power steering, anti-lock brakes, a trip computer, stabilizer, tire pressure monitoring, the LATCH system for child seats, air conditioning, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system, a CVTCS, 46 less horsepower (63 vs 109),  auxiliary 12-volt DC power outlets, a 4-way adjustable driver’s seat, the ability to play CDs or MP3s, an auxillary audio jack, a radio data system, speed-sensitive volume control, illuminated steering-wheel mounted audio controls, roof-mounted airbags, an ELR seatbelt system, modern crumple zones and buckling mechanisms…

To put it bluntly, it is lacking a lot of features. Probably more than $4k worth.

Which would suggest that the inflation on at least some vehicles is probably pretty close to $0 - you're getting about as much value per dollar spent now as you were then, if not more.

As it turns out, inflation has not been anywhere near the CPI numbers. People have more and better stuff - houses have continued to get larger, people's stuff is better, they have new things (Internet, computers, tablets, laptops, cell phones, smart phones) that are considered staples which few people *had* in 1990... the list goes on. If you look at things like video games, like home movies, like computers, the nominal price of them has barely budged in decades. The first Apple computer cost $666 in the mid 1970s! Midrange computers have had the same nominal price for decades now. TVs have gotten better *and* cheaper, with higher resolution, better color displays, lesser power consumption, ect.

The reality is that simply multiplying together CPI numbers and claiming that is somehow ""adjusting for inflation"" over the course of decades is obvious nonsense. You'd have to argue that all of the improvements in stuff between 1990 and 2017 plus all of the new stuff people have is worth only $3,900.

If we look at the nominal price of 1990 quality goods in 2017, this is simply not the case - the improvements are much, much larger, and worth much more than $3,900/year.

This is why it is important to sanity check numbers before you throw them out there. It is pretty immediately obvious that a set of 1990 goods is worth far less than a set of 2017 goods, and that the difference is much more than $3,900/year.",1493597097

I was commenting on your complaint that it should be smaller, because thats more ""apple like"". 

Don't you also think that if this were possible and cost effective, that apple wouldn't already be doing this? 

Capacitors (Which are used to smooth out he 60hz alternating current cycle was provided from to the AC to DC adapter, via a wall socket ) Have a minimum size. They carry extremely high voltage, and discharge quickly in a circuit. The reason that Apple cannot make this smaller in this case, is physics. You can use the smallest AVAILABLE capacitors (Believe me they do already) for smaller wattages, but you have a minimum based on the need for 

a.) Capacitors (Multiple)


b.) Voltage rectifiers &lt;- This part actually changes the AC to DC.


c.) Transformers. &lt;- Electromagnetic Induction


d.) PWM &lt;-Power management


e.) Heatsinks. &lt;-Metal used to draw heat away from a component.



The above devices. 

I think your complaint that the ac/dc adapter for your laptop being too big because you bought an apple is dismissive of all that I explained above, and that the epidemic in this country of ""not knowing how the sausage is made, just knowing that the sausage is good"" is a giant problem in a society that desperately needs a wake up when it comes to our lack of leadership in engineering, mathematics, space exploration and sciences.

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I've heard this before but there are some circumstances where the not knowing can cause severe psychological damage that can only be rectified with some light shed on a certain set of unknown experiences where you were given enough evidence to be horrified, but never given any sense of closure to be at peace. Sometimes only the truth can set you free.  
  
I was the subject of an investigation by over-reaching federal agencies. In the course of the investigation they criminalized an innocent person and conducted an extremely intrusive and exploitative investigation, sharing very private health information with friends and family, without my consent, damaging those relationships, and compounding the complications of a  psychological injury that resulted in an extended bout of severe PTSD. In the course of investigating a false claim, some folks in law enforcement stumbled across some online musings of mine that led them to think that the case was not serious and that I was somehow just some joker faking a psychological injury. By the time they realized what they'd done, they were already knee-deep in something that, if all facts were known in the public, people would be horrified about their conduct. Rather than make it right, they chose to cover their ass. They shut the whole thing down and rather than giving me the little bit of light I needed to recalibrate my grip on reality and have any trust in humanity again, they responded to my FOIA requests asking ""why do you need to know?"", but not before diminishing my credibility, whether intended or not. A few people did eventually give me a slight heads up but they were clearly afraid to elaborate on details so somebody put a hush on it. So many odd experiences have happened that I'm just exhausted from living in this false reality, in limbo. There is no returning from this mindf--- without the truth to be able to get a grip on reality or even begin to trust again. I don't even bother trying to rekindle old friendships etc. I'm just tired of being reminded of a situation where I was scrutinized behind what felt like one way mirrors without ever getting the chance to defend myself. Such an odd situation. I can't imagine that anyone could ever understand it from my perspective but just understand that, however unlikely, there are circumstances that can cause damage to a person that, without clarity, are essentially permanent. If the truth sets you free, being denied it can imprison you. ",1493597101

Your second point is right, but that's not exactly what we were talking about.

"simpleliving","t5_2r0za","&gt;$30,000 over the course of a year.

And then:

&gt;$500 rent...and utilities...about 1/3 of the cost.

So if the rent and utilities together at full price were, say, $2,000 a month, they normally would have spent the 30k in 15 months. But now that should last about 3 times as long, so perhaps 45 months, or 3 years 9 months.

In other words, going through the trouble of this nets them at least 2-1/2 years of free rent and utilities. Or even more if they can keep it up. Pretty impressive.

I'm skeptical the bus will last that long without needing expensive input though. And if they think they'll be just as comfortable 2-3 years down the line when some of those kids become school-age, they may be in for a surprise. (Edit: I just noticed she's preggers! 4 kids and both parents in a bus. Wow.)

The Thunder would be looking at that 2012 roster and be pretty much locked into that outside of the MLE. They have a couple of big seasons but no way can they stop LeBron without multiple elite defenders. The best perimeter defender was Sefolosha, a guy who has shown he can't guard LeBron.

It's pretty clear that elite perimeter defense has been the only way to stop LeBron, and the Thunder with Westbrook, Harden, and Durant would struggle to make it out of the West vs the Spurs or Warriors.

I know this may seem antithetical, but bear with me. Going to an early morning Mass allows you to do all of those things. Obviously you may be thinking to yourself, ""but getting up early? Doesn't that defeat the purpose?!""

Well, think about it like this. Let's say you would normally wake up at 10am to get to the 11am Mass. That means that you're probably not back to your house until 12:30 *at the earliest*. And by that point the day has gotten into full swing. No sleeping in, no lounging around, by that point it's time to do what you gotta do.

But, let's say you woke up at 6am and went to a 7am Mass. That means you're back, in all likelihood, by 8:15. Even in the Ordinary Form, most early Masses tend to be the liturgical equivalent of a Low Mass. That means you can ***sleep for 4 more hours and still wake up by Noon***.

I used MassTimes to check around the Roxborough area and found the following:

Our Mother of Consolation has a 7:30am Mass, Saint Philip Neri Church has a 7:00am Mass, and Our Lady of Lourdes has an 8:00am Mass.

I know it seems strange to think of an early morning Mass as a solution, but believe me when I say that there's something magical about a post-Mass siesta.",1493597105

Heck he wouldn't even BE able to run that fast cuz he wouldn't even be able to grip the ground to accelerate. But due to the Speedforce energy, he is able to be just fine yet still have that kinetic energy transfer so he can shatter the wall. 

So basically in universe, the Flash can run at whatever speed he wants and hit you without breaking his hands. **Totally** science fiction but then again, it's an in universe explanation to why the Flash isn't killed by hitting a bumblebee at the speed of sound lol",1493597107

Sendo being (iirc) on a 5-fight win streak shows that he's at least the level of his rank, and arguably is the best in the world - he just haven't gotten a title shot yet. Also he wrecked ippo in that spar/friendly fight and also beat Miyata in a spar (although Miyata was holding back). So, hard to say, internally between the 3 obvious rivals of Ippo sendo has beaten the others. He doesn't have a title though. Then again I don't know how strong Volgs current division is cmpd to the FW.

1) Sendo

2) Volg 

3) Miyata

"history","t5_2qh53","There are some great answers here. Tanks and airplanes are a major part, as are the trains behind the lines ferrying troops into the gaps faster than the attackers could pour men into the breach. 

I think what is somewhat lacking is the tactics. Tanks and planes existed in WWI, but it took time to refine how to use them on the battlefield (would this be called effect tank and air power doctrine?). Further, at the outbreak, INFANTRY tactics, too, were e outdated, too, and also develop over the war. In 1914 infantry operated much as they had in 1870, think Franco-Prussian war or US civil war. Massed infantry charges were still common and the bayonet was a fundamental weapon of war. By 1917, both sides of the western front had abandoned the old tactics and switched to shocktroops and infiltration tactics, which meant bypassing strong points with lead infantry using grenades, pistols and some rifle, the idea being to keep the advance moving as long as possible since as soon as it faltered, it would take another barrage and fresh reinforcements to get it moving again. 

Finally, the unique situation was August 1914 in the West led to the stalemate. Two large, determined, industrial, populous and competent armed faced each other. When the battle of the Marne failed, everyone was near exhaustion. By the end of the race to sea, everyone WAS exhausted. No one had reserves to throw in to tip the balance. This allowed a period of entrenchment to develop as new forces were mustered and trained. Now the other factors like machine guns, ineffective infantry tactics, etc., took their toll. Had the Germans succeeded in entrapping the French in August 1914, the war would probably have been much shorter with no trench warfare. Both sides were 'all in' and had one army been destroyed, their nation likely would have sued for peace. ",1493597108

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; The socialist response is that nationalization does not solve any of the problems of capitalism 

This is what I thought you were initially implying. That's the stance of Man Ray who decries capitalism as being the problem in and of itself without understanding its the insidious relationship with an institution that permits force (government) which is the problem. Capitalism by itself is voluntary exchange in open markets. Capitalism + government is controlled exchange in controlled markets for the benefit of specific capitalists.

The video is a perfect example of the lack of understanding of the root cause. Socialists think the root cause is capitalism itself, which is incorrect. If I twist socialism into a dictatorship, ""that's not real socialism"" (which is correct!)

&gt; How saying ""but capitalism is not the same as government"" is relevant to anything about this dispute, I don't know.

Because you ignored the very next words in my sentence: ""Government and capitalism are two different things that get lumped together by socialists because crony capitalists are in bed with crony politicians."" I keep making references about how government is the problem in any dynamic. Capitalism's problems are a result of government. Socialist programs problems are a result of government (as well as other reasons which I'll leave out for the sake of simplicity). Dictatorship is a problem of government.

"DC_Cinematic","t5_2ykm6","Absolutely. The film Snyder showed the studio execs in mid 2015 was without a doubt the original cut. The 3 hr UE. 

 I guess management needed to be a part of the production from its scripting stages. Snyder made the film he wanted to make. He did his job, but he had no oversight, but even he was aware that a 3 hr cut isnt necessarily what the studio wants.

The studio shouldve just released the UE. It probably would've made less with the decrease in number of showings, but it would've been a more respected film, and that carries more wait in the end. But the movie was uneven in its delivery of action sequences. It was mostly contained to the last act. Having a 2 hour set up of character building and dialogue isn't the best strategy when marketing to GA. They want to be entertained. WB probably saw this and wanted to get to the action much quicker, even though they wouldnt' have had to do that had there been multiple action sequences throughout the entire film. But all we got in the first 2 hrs was the short scene of Superman in Africa, Knightmare Batman, Batmobile scene, and then the non-stop 3rd hour.

This film needed clear work from the very beginning.  The ""filmmaker-driven"" approach can still work as long as the studios create a sort of minimal blueprint for the director that sort of matches up with what ""entertains"" a general audience. ",1493597108

At the end of episode 11, you see Homura lying down miserable and her soul gem darkens as she puts her hand down and tears well up. A single tear drops but it hits the ground because Madoka clasps her hand and raises it before it can happen. I'm sure if Madoka hadn't grabbed her hand in that instant, the tear would have dropped onto Homura's soul gem and she would have turned into a witch right then, which would explain the why it showed the tear drop on the floor.

Maybe I'm biased but a lack of owner-occupied and long-term rental seems to be a great way to end up with residents who don't take care of their rubbish, then the attitude continues with the entire local area.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Não tenho como falar nada sobre dados e números, na verdade parto do princípio de que a previdência, como muitas outras áreas de interesse público no país, é mal-gerida e tem recursos desviados. Só gostaria de apontar ao fato de que, em geral, a medida em que um país se desenvolve e passa do padrão de terceiro a primeiro mundo, é natural que ocorra uma reforma no sistema previdenciário devido a 2 fatores principais:

* A expectativa de vida aumenta;

* A taxa de natalidade diminui.

Isto significa que, em %, há cada vez mais pessoas idosas (= beneficiárias da previdência) e menos pessoas jovens (= colaboradores da previdência). Ou seja, uma menor % de dinheiro entra na previdência e uma maior % sai. Logo, mesmo em um país gerido perfeitamente, é natural que reformas tenham de ser feitas a cada 2 ou 3 gerações de modo a não quebrar essa conta - pelo menos enquanto os 3 fatores que citei acima cotinuem na mesma tendência. Uma das formas mais fáceis (e impopulares) de corrigir isso é aumentar a idade mínima de aposentadoria, baseando-se na lógica de que, se a expectativa de vida aumentou, significa que a saúde média das pessoas com 50~60 anos também, e logo elas continuam aptas (e possivelmente voluntárias) a trabalhar.",1493597114

Chances of getting him likely depend on the way the FO handled McCloughan's departure.

How it was handled between Scot, Bruce and Dan really isn't known. 

What Cooley did seems like an asshole move, but if he genuinely didn't know, it's semi-understandable. It was clearly accurate, so he was doing his job, but publicly questioning if your alcoholic superior has fallen off the wagon isn't a good move. 

Edit: A possible move would be to promote a ""face."" Similar to what the 49ers did with Lynch. Let Schaffer handle contracts, Campbell handle scouting, and Bruce oversee it.

No, Bannon is not waging war against anybody. That's more anonymous source bullshit in the media.

President trump is entirely within the rules to continue operating his hotels, get over it. The Mar-a-lago is a valuable asset to the president, it gives him an opportunity to host world leaders in a more laid back environment. Mar-a-lago was gifted to the government for the use of presidents before they sold it to trump. Trumps travel expenses will be larger, obamas was smaller than most (lazy), as he actually gets out of washington to speak to real americans across the country. He has saved billions already on the F-35 and Air force 1 projects plus he saved thousands of jobs and secured investment across the rust belt by pressuring companies, travel expenses are small change compared.

Trump is an extremely effective communicator, hence why his rallies are so popular. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK1eUSvxJSQ

Illegal immigrants have broken the law, I have no sympathy for criminals, they are a drain on our resources and commit a disproportionate level of crime. Trump targeted criminal aliens, which have been deported in record numbers along with regular illegals. Illegal border crossings are down 73%, this is what a strong president brings. 80% of illegal women are raped on the journey, luckily they have trump to stop that.

The middle class decline started under glass-steagall.

Trump signed more laws in his first 100 days than the last 3 presidents, so he's having a pretty good honeymoon. The failed healthcare bill was actually a blessing in disguise for president trump, it was a crappy plan he had to support to keep ryan on side, now that it failed he gets to watch obamacare implode which it will, it's already down to one provider in many states and some states premiums will double. If trump can't get his tax plan through then I see no future for establishment republicans. 

Obama was the worst president in history for internet privacy, are you high?

The clean streams act was pathetic, it gave the EPA power to regulate waters the size of a puddle on private property. Trumps repeal included the protection of actual streams that lead to rivers.

You really are a victim of liberal media, Trump didn't repeal an order so the mentally ill can buy guns (background checks are still in place), this proves you just read headlines on sites like salon and vox and form opinions. He repealed an order saying that someone who cannot manage their finances is dangerous and cannot buy guns. That order was so messed up and entirely unconstitutional, the American civil liberties union and many other disability groups supported the repeal. 

http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/444582/no-gop-did-not-just-repeal-background-check-system-or-give-guns-mentally-ill

Trumps first 100 days has also been hampered by the dems using obstruction tactics, he still doesn't have his full cabinet. 

I don't know how you think you are qualified to psychoanalyze me, you're just being silly and divisive now. You have this convenient little picture painted of a stereotypical republican. In reality you are not used to your world view being questioned because you hang around with all lefty friends and get all your news from left sources. I'm honestly a classical liberal, your regressive brand of liberalism pushed me away. Neoliberals rely on identity politics, without telling minorities they are oppressed they have a nothing platform based on possible future environmental disaster. I believe in the American identity, we are all one, fuck hyphens. 

You keep hiding away from discourse like most lefties, there is a reason why people like ben shapiro and milo destroy your type in debates, it's because you are used to attacking peoples character instead of their points.

The idea of having non-homogeneous religious-social structures has also existed for a long time - probably as long as tribes have been ruling each other by violent conquest.  The Egyptians had client states of differing religions, and so did the Greeks and Romans.

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","I'm the worst so account for that, but as a raised Yankee fan who used to have a lot of hate for the Mets, I think that it's a case where a rivalry can be more friendly than anything. Even as a kid I admired Piazza enormously, and I've been to some Mets games over the years too.

As my posting history shows I'm an Isles fan, and I hate the Rangers more than I hate the Sox, the Eagles, the Cowboys, the fucking Patriots, I hate them more than any team in sports. But I can enjoy a Mets game, I have very fond memories of watching the Mets with my grandmother and grandfather (Sox fans, respectively departed and not doing so well) and my other grandmother and I have watched the Mets a lot recently, as well. The Rangers and Islanders are direct competitors, see each other a lot during the year, and have one of the most vicious rivalries in the NHL. Yankees and Mets is more of a cultural phenomena and I can't bring myself to hate the Mets *that* much. I'll make a joke about the Mets but I would fucking fight people about the Rangers.

It's probably a lot easier for a lot of people to say they don't hate the Yanks now that they're rebuilding some, and this is the sort of thread that naturally would draw responses agreeing with OP but I don't think it's that weird. New York's baseball history is so rich that hating the Yankees doesn't need to be part of your identity as a Mets fan in the way that say, hating the Rangers is for an Isles fan.",1493597121

"LegalAdviceUK","t5_32g6u","Having maintenance or technical issues, even if they're caused by a third party and are out of BA's control, isn't an exceptional circumstance. The fact that a third party operates the cable is of no relevance, as they're acting on BA's behalf and so BA is responsible - you don't have a contract with the cable company, you have one with BA.

Really, exceptional circumstances is a bad title, because it makes it seem like the airline isn't responsible if things are 'a little difficult'.

It's not. If the airline did anything less than taking all reasonable steps to prevent the delay, they're responsible. Previous court cases have shown that in the case of maintenance or technical issues, unless there's an inherent design flaw that was previously unknown, or some really bizarre scenario like that, they have to pay up. For example, mobile boarding stairs collisions with aircraft have been ruled as a non-exceptional circumstance, and this is pretty similar.

They should have had, or used, another plane on standby. They chose not to - probably for financial reasons. Nevertheless, it would have been reasonable to, rather than waiting around 6 hours for a fix. So they didn't take all reasonable steps to prevent the delay.

Take it all the way. BA, and really all airlines, are known for rejecting you flat out, even when you have a good case. Read up on your legal rights on the CAA website, and read through the text of the relevant law on the EU website (it's not too long). Don't hesitate to threaten alternative dispute resolution or court if they decide to call your bluff. Go through with your threat, and either feel them wince at a judgement giving you your statutory entitlement plus compensation for their messing-you-about, or be happy at a big fat settlement offer.",1493597121
"fo4","t5_2tzv4","The minigun's a terrible weapon against that deathclaw, or anything with much armour for that matter. You're better off using VATS and melee.

Ammo: there's plenty around, provided that you're not trying to use full auto weapons. Single shots penetrate armour better, and they're more efficient to boot. Full auto is a gimmick that only really works well with a couple of the legendary weapons. Basically, just check every container, cabinet and satchel. Learn to recognise the safes - they can be hard to pick out, but you get used to them. The ammo you pick up depends largely on level - as you go on you start getting more ammo for the more potent weapons.

The biggest difference comes from modding weapons. Even if you're not skilled into the appropriate perks yet, just applying a few basic mods to a pipe rifle can completely change the experience. You can cheaply add 25% damage to your basic pipe weapon right from the start.

Useful early weapons:
1. If you check the upper floor of the house on the far eastern side of the same road that the museum is on, there's always a bolt-action pipe rifle already modded for basic sniping. You won't have much ammo for it early on, but it's nice for hard targets.  
2. On the road down from the Red Rocket garage, the first house that you see has a baseball bat behind the front door, easy to miss. Once again, you can mod it early with a bleeding effect that stacks quite nicely on the deathclaw.  
3. Don't underestimate the good old 10mm pistol. It outclasses the pipe weapons quite handily. Alternatively, don't be afraid to use the pipe weapons early on - they may look like scrap, and they mostly are, but their easy modding and flexibility is great for early-game. Plus, they're *light*.  
4. If you really have to go heavy, there's a garage not too far south-east of the industrial complex. It's at the edge of a small village populated by ghouls, but there shouldn't be any near the garage. On the roof is a sniper rifle. It's heavy, it's slow, and you won't have much ammo for it early on, but it's very accurate and does good damage early on. You'll be able to mod the pipe sniper earlier than you can this rifle.  
5. When Preston tells you to help him in the museum, he also tells you to pick up a laser musket. This thing is once again heavy as anything and needs to be cranked after every shot, but it can be overcharged by reloading additional times and is, once again, much better against the deathclaw than the minigun. Assuming you've not used the ammo you get for it on the raiders in the museum, that is.

There are a bunch of other weapons scattered around the map like this, but these are the easiest to reach, and usually you won't have to engage in combat for them.",1493597122

"fireemblem","t5_2t0cn","Yeah I was just re-reading my list and I definitely think there should be some shifting, mostly Alm in the top 5 and Hector and Eliwood maybe just below it.



Alm vs. Ephraim is very interesting and I'm going to break this down because this is my favorite lord matchup out of all of them.

They're pretty similar in terms of upbringing. Both pretty much take control of an army and crush an enemy country single handedly. I'll give this one to ***Alm*** though since he does single-handedly kill a dragon god while also overthrowing a very militant enemy country.

Alm's a natural born leader like you said although Ephraim is similar. Here is where I'd argue that I would give ***Ephraim*** the edge in battle tactics and battle-sense in a fight. Ephraim's reckless for sure, but he's not a slouch once a fight gets going and he knows the ins and outs of a battle going on. This is probably the one where you'd disagree the most and that's fine, it's just how I feel.

Signature weapon wise, Ephraim's Siegmund gives him superior reach to Alm's Falchion, although Alm counter plays this with his shield. Ephraim on his mount also grants better mobility and hit and run strikes but when they're both on foot, they're both pretty even. I call this ***even*** since a mounted Ephraim is dangerous to a foot soldier, but on foot, Alm's shield allows him to block and rush in.

Training wise, both are trained by battle-hardened, accomplished knights, Alm with Mycen, and Ephraim with Duessel. Alm's training was apparently very rigorous if his Heroes' quote has anything to say, and Ephraim eventually reaches the end of his teachings and arguably surpasses Duessel spear-wise at the end of their Supports. This is a tough call since I still know little about SoV and the extent of Alm's training, so for now, I'd give this to ***Ephraim***.

On fighting styles, both strike me as very aggressive opponents, with Ephraim leaning towards aggressive and precise, and Alm leaning towards aggressive and overwhelming if the SoV cutscenes with Rudolph indicates anything. I'm not going to claim I know which one is more effective in dealing with the other so hopefully someone can help me out with that. 

Now, strictly off those things, I give the very, *very*, slight edge to ***Ephraim** on a 1v1 with Alm. I'm talking, 5.5/10.

The real kicker, though, is Alm's [SoV Skill spoilers](#s ""special skill, Draconic Conquest. From what I've seen, that attack is absolutely devastating and can easily turn a fight just on what it can do."")

So taking in that, I think that's what would give ***Alm*** a victory in the end.

TL:DR Ephraim wins until Alm decides he's had enough.",1493597122

Nothing will make you more eager about life than seeing goals being accomplished. Keep a journal and write your thoughts down.

But you say *I also want to implement some sort of friend list.*. implying that many players can play and invite each other? Then it only makes sense to use a server that controls everything. 

Not using a server would lead you to creating some hacked up class that ends up trying to act like one and makes your life even more difficult. Servers are cool and you learn a lot, they're really not as scary as they sound.

**I'm not asking for code but could anyone help me visualize a way to implement such features**

Create a GameServer class that listens for incoming connections and spins up a new thread for each new player connecting. You'd need to keep a hashmap or something that keeps track of each player and their thread with all associated player info so you send messages back to each player and send friend invites to selected players etc.

The GameServer then has a loop that continuously listens to messages sent in from each player and then processes the request by looking at the 'command'. So one command could be a player requesting to move which involves the server modifying the game state and then broadcasting that state back out to each players that's connected.

Agree on a data exchange format between client/server like json or something. For example.

    player -&gt; server
    {
       command: MOVE
       player: alfie2938
       move: up
       alive: true
    } 

    server -&gt; players
    {
       command: GAMESTATE_UPDATE

       lastPlayerMoved: alfie2938,

"touhou","t5_2qvi5","The gun in the stock room is a really interesting point but I feel like as a murder weapon, it has a number of major issues.

First, unless it's possible to remove it from its room, then Mokou would have had to have been killed in the stock room. Ignoring the fact that she was seen alive in the trash room just before her death (something a certain illusionist could handle setting up), I don't see how it would be possible to move her to across the game area without leaving a trail of blood or otherwise arousing suspicion.

I also kind of doubt the fact that the bullet failed to penetrate the second victim's head completely despite being .45 caliber will be a major piece of evidence, if for no other reason that there isn't anyone among the group of players that should have the kind of knowledge for that sort of deduction. Firearms are not a major point of study in Gensokyo. Reisen or Nitori might be able to say as much, but even if either of them were the hidden extra player I don't think either will be participating in this trial.

Regardless, I seem to recall that it was a rather significant point earlier on that only the ultimate weapons or the player's abilities could be used to commit murder. For whatever reason, Yukari set up the game area such that no other object is lethal enough, which to me excludes the possibility of a makeshift firearm as you propose.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I was diagnosed with anorexia nervosa at 19, and am now 23 and recovered. I was a competitive figure skater, and still struggle with extreme perfectionism, so how it started is pretty straightforward. I wanted to be thinner, I started dieting, and that slid very quickly into starving myself.

**[how did that change you as a person]** It made me a much more mentally stable person because all the therapy I went through is applicable to a lot of things beyond my eating disorder. It also made me someone who promotes balance and pleasurable eating to the people around me, and who is very skeptical about most nutrition ""research"".

**[how is your body now]** My body is significantly healthier than I was when I was sick, but taking two years off of exercise to recover definitely hurt my fitness levels. I picked up a few stretch marks while weight-restoring, but I'm now at a pretty average weight for someone of my height, and my blood work, blood pressure, and bone density are all much improved, as are my energy levels. I'm now finally getting back into exercise and running a few times per week!

**[what was your experience like recovering]** Recovery was the hardest thing I ever did. I was in outpatient treatment for two years, and it was by far the most emotionally and psychologically draining experience of my life. I cried a lot, and I had a lot of panic attacks. I've had very short relapses since, but always pulled myself out of them. I feel like my recovery is pretty stable, but look forward to feeling less sensitive about my triggers, and being able to participate in conversations about diet and exercise instead of just shutting down/removing myself.

**[what are some major triggers for you]** Conversations about diet and exercise. Hearing about how people are putting themselves through extreme diets. Other people criticizing their own bodies. People making conversations about my body (positive or negative). All of these things make me incredibly anxious and occasionally trigger behaviours. I do my best to remove myself from those situations when I can, and to talk myself down from the stress.",1493597137

We can suggest to Lord Titus to make the claim again that the castle's vassalage should be transferred to him. We'll put our support behind House Peake, and even if Osmund were to accept, it would boost our relations with Peake while we search for other ways to destroy Tyrell integrity. Another possible plan we can pursue is somehow forcing Osmund to attack one of the holds in the Westmarch on false pretenses - a land-hungry lord still not sated from the spoils of war continues to rain terror on those forced into Tyrell vassalage.

The battery is amazing. I charged it last time on the April 21st, I've used GPS for about four hours total in that time. Plus messed with plenty of watchfaces and countlessly fiddled with settings and I'm at 21% right now. 

So far, the only issue I'm having (and it's a known issue on the 5X) is the watch not sending certain info to custom watchfaces. Hopefully they can get that minor bug fixed soon. Overall an excellent watch. Way better than any AndroidWear or Pebble watch I've had",1493597144

I understand if you don't want to subscribe (though I think our digital-only subscription price is a pretty good deal, and we're working to try to make it even more worthwhile in the months ahead), but it's a reality of the business. Nothing is free, even if it looks that way from the outside.

Italian minor (prefer Florence, but probably much easier as Venice or Genoa) into British colonial empire.

Stay Italian and own Egypt, India, and some American colonies... quite fun, and its interesting to transfer trade through Egypt instead of all the way around Africa. Bonus points for not forming Italy and staying small in Europe. Came up with this because I wanted to get Indonesian trade before all other Europeans, and was out of range of African colonies... so I decided to take out Suez and skip the 30+ years of going around the cape and waiting for colonial range techs.

Paul Bettany has possibly one film left on his contract (this isn't 100% confirmed), so it would make sense that he could potentially die; given that Thanos is going to need the Mind Stone for the Infinity Gauntlet.

I can see this. But to me then the only thing going for Relinquished is it being a near hard counter to GK. I feel GK deals with other decks better than Relinquished does, especially Burn and Mill. Relinquished's counters are just too common.

&gt; Harpies imo is the best out of the top three. It can OtC GK tributes and also take out defensive cards not letting GK get their tribute off

I can accept it being your top deck because it's more then just HHG. OtC is near broken in the current state of the game, being the only reliable m/t monster destruction that exists. Imo, it's access to OtC that makes it more lethal and the backrow destruction is what pushes it above all other vanilla beatdowns.

I don't see how GK would have issues with it though. If anything it seems like an even matchup, both playing defensive cards and going back and forth removing monsters from each other's field. SE is a potent monster removal option while Double Summon allows for OTK potential. ",1493597148

"BetterFap","t5_368u8","This would probably be big on resource and devtime, so maybe not viable or even possible with current technology, but an autotagging system that reads all the frames of the video and provide a set of tags, replacing or being an addition to the current tags created by humans.

This would standardize the way videos are tagged and it would be a lot more accurate to describe what is in the video since human tagging is poor at best, most of the videos have tags missing that should be there(lots of POV videos without the ""pov"" tag, for example). 

The improvements that this would bring to the system imo would be huge, the recommender system would be 1000% more effective, clicking ""I want to see more of this"" would actually bring meaningful results most of the time, it would be great. But again, sadly it probably wouldn't be viable, the only system that can autotag porn vids that I know of is [miles-deep](https://github.com/ryanjay0/miles-deep), but right now it can only identify a handful of tags, even though its mostly more of a proof-of-concept thing, I don't know how possible would be to expand it to a bigger set of tags while maintaining accuracy.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","My problem in a relationship with a bi-girl is simply that we can never know the depth of feeling someone does or doesn't have toward one gender or another.

I can trust, no problem, but I have eyes and ears and am going to be hyper-sensitized to competition I can't compete with. So, if you think you can slide a little grrly action on the side, maybe once or twice it goes unnoticed, but no more than that. And no, I don't want a semi-permanent third party in the bed who's not that interested in me at *any* point in the relationship.

So, if the lady in question can ""give it all up"" (except the porn. girl-on-girl is not my thing but I get it), then I'm good. I don't share, I'm funny like that. Not on the net, not in person.

If you are an inventive, creative lover,  you will not suffer many of the obvious pitfalls of  straight-guy-on-bi-girl sex.

I have a push-to 8"" Dob -- the Orion Intelliscope. My son has just about ""got"" the idea of aiming the scope: look through the Telrad, then look through the eyepiece. The Moon is his favorite target. It will stay in the field of view long enough for him to satisfy his curiosity, then he wants to look at something else. Re-centering the scope a couple of times isn't an issue; it takes my only a few seconds to do so. Pretty soon I think he'll be able to do it himself.

I've been considering getting a GoTo Dob, but have so far not pulled the trigger. While the tracking might be nice, the Intelliscope feature on my current Dob allows us to find dimmer objects fairly easily, but doesn't interfere with just pushing the scope to whatever object strikes our fancy at the moment. 

I think at this age it's really important to be able to react to impromptu I-want-to-go-look-at-the-Moon-right-now moments. The 8"" Dob is light enough that I can set it up, from garage to driveway, in about two minutes. Putting it away is likewise just as easy. The GoTo Dob might be heavy enough that I'd think twice about getting it out.

I believe in empowering kids. I'm considering getting the Orion StarBlast 4.5"" tabletop scope which is small enough that he can set it up *by himself* and doesn't need a stepladder to look into. The less I stand between him and the heavenly sights, the better.",1493597154

"politics","t5_2cneq","Newt Gingrich paved the way for Trump. I'd urge anyone who is unfamiliar with him to acquaint themselves:

&gt; Back when the average millennial voter was still playing the original Pokemon—or, you know, being born—Newt Gingrich brought a new, confrontational, shoot-the-hostages approach to Congress, shutting down the government twice in the process. He's the man who divorced his first wife while she was in the hospital for cancer, and was eventually forced to resign as speaker not only because of an embarrassing Republican wipeout at the polls, but also because Congress began investigating a labyrinth of fraudulent nonprofits that looked like the kind of scandal that would send anyone back into permanently quiet retirement.
&gt; 
&gt; Gingrich styles himself a big-ideas, think-outside-the-box kind of guy. In 1994, he penned a national platform for Republican congressional candidates and called it a Contract with America. It was an attack on taxes, welfare, moral decadence and the entrenched political establishment. Its promises included a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution; a crime bill financing prison construction and additional law enforcement; an exhortation to “discourage illegitimacy and teen pregnancy” and reform welfare; increased military spending and decreased participation in the U.N.; capital gains tax cuts; and term limits for legislators.
&gt; 
&gt; It was a bold, conservative agenda, and politically quite popular. Gingrich and his Republican army claimed it as a mandate and continued to try to ram the Contract’s various iterations through the White House with as little compromise as possible. They wanted to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for drilling. They wanted a quarter-of-a-trillion dollars in tax cuts. They wanted to get rid of certain government agencies. They wanted to cut funding to the congressional Black Caucus. 
&gt; 
&gt; More than anyone else in the modern history of Congress, it’s Gingrich who observers credit for bringing the hyperpartisan, obstructionist approach to Washington that we associate with the capital to this day. “When in doubt, Democrats lie,"" he said in 1988. He trafficked in sticky political nicknames: the “loony Left” and “daffy Dukakis.” In 1996, he actually sent out a memo to Republican candidates to help them learn to “speak like Newt.”

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt;My line is one that leaves room for no error, for if you are wrong, that means you have allowed the executions of millions

Gotta balance the equation bud. If you are wrong you are limiting the bodily autonomy of millions of free individuals, increasing their risk of morbidity and mortality by forcing them to carry to term, and exacting a large economic hit to both these women, their families and society at large. The precautionary principle cuts both ways.

&gt;My example was a correct comparison.
Yours is a logically fallacious false equivalence.

Actually it's a reductio ad absurdum, demonstrating the false equivalence in your own example. So you are kind of right I guess.

&gt;Far more then you, I wager. I have no need to justify myself to you, random stranger, and see no reason to list what I do as if I did need to justify myself.

&gt;No. Abortion is literally killing a human life.

But you don't really believe that. As in my other post, I would posit that if you think an abortion provider is literally equilivent to the most prolific serial murderer on the planet, you would probably do a bit more than argue about it on the Internet or print out flyers or picket clinics.

No, no, no, no, no. You were implying that he came into office and had to deal with those crises immediately. Given the context of the conversation, that is what you were implying. Let me quote you directly.

&gt;When Obama took office, he had to deal with the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression, the Arab Spring, Syria, Libya, and the continuing fighting in Afghanistan and the emergence of ISIS. Not to mention Russia starting to act a fool in his last two years. AND dealing with Iran

This is what you said. You can quote flawed polling data all day long, but you said that **when Obama took office** he had to deal with a finanical crisis (true), the Arab Spring (false), Syria (false), Libya (false), Afghanistan (true) and ISIS (half-true - though the organization had existed for several years, it came to fruition in 2013, after Obama had been RE-elected).

Listen, babe - the only thing I took issue with in my original comment was your assertion that Obama came into office immediately having to deal with these crises. And you were wrong &lt;3

School Vouchers = Government funded private industry.  As a center-right person, I am against this.  I don't own stock in a Charter school system.  Charter schools look like shit, and they are clearly for-profit, and a bad environment.  The whole Charter system has ruined education in this country.  

What made sense was local, small schools in your area.  This was expensive, but it worked, and it was the system I was educated under.  

The education system today is headed in the wrong direction, and vouchers are very much part of this.  

Public education is like roads or national defense.  It's something the government is good at, and private companies are not.  It sounds good when it's a special private school.  It's fucking dismal when it's applied to everyone.  ",1493597160

With Villain Siege tokens, spend them on Elsa. With dimension rifts, Yellowjacket would be a good option to get.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I don't think younger infants really need toys at all. Once they've learned to grip things a plastic spatula  is as good for hitting themselves in the face as anything else. Though rattles make noise when you move them - there's a reason that's a classic. And for older infants, educational toys are anything they can manipulate and comprehend. Cups and blocks and stacking rings are among the  early classics here, but they rapidly start seeking out more exciting toys - one toy that was a big hit with both kids around 7-9 months was a noisy ball tower with a spiral ramp. As they approach toddlerhood they will use bells and whistles and other noisemaking toys to drive you insane. 

Plastic is good - lightweight and easy to clean. It holds bright colors well and they can be integral to the plastic so you don't have to worry about paint coming off. Remember that everything heads for the mouth, and everything is a teether when the teeth come in. Commercial toys must meet safety standards that an Etsy crafter may not be aware of. ",1493597165

"xboxone","t5_2xbci","Here's my take on how to have a Flash game:

-----

The game starts out with Barry somehow hosing his power or his connection to the Speed Force. Maybe he fucks up the timeline so bad that he finds himself powerless or near powerless, and in a world where nobody's ever heard of the Flash.
The point of this is that the game would start off fresh, with the player not being able to do much, but as the game goes on you could improve Barry's speed and learn new skills and whatnot.

.

I'm thinking of an open world type of game, with missions and quests and everything. But instead of being able to wait years and years before starting a mission, the longer you wait, the more it impacts the game. Suppose that a villain, let's say it's Heat Wave, starts doing bad guy stuff and you have to stop him. If you choose to start the mission almost immediately, the open world won't be impacted by his presence at all. But if you wait a while before starting, then there will be consequences in the open world -- in Heat Wave's case, there will be more reports of fires and you'll have to save more people from burning buildings.

.

The more you just let bad things happen (e.g. Villains roaming free and people not being saved), the lower your Hero Reputation will be. Having a high HR gives you certain advantages, like getting help from cops in the area and whatnot. Your HR can't go below 0 unless you actually *do* bad things (like hurting people or destroying/stealing property), but if it's close to 0, people will consider you more of a vigilante than a hero. If your HR goes below 0, you'll be considered a Villain. Cops will shoot at you, any 'good guys' you've befriended or allied with will attack you, and people will cower in fear when in your presence. Your standing with other villains won't be friendly, but it'll become neutral, with the option to be partners in crime.

.

If you're fighting crime and you cause collateral damage, your HR might go down a bit, but not as much as if you cause unprovoked damage/harm.

.

There would also be a Free Play mode where you can just mess around without risking your HR levels, so you can do whatever you want between missions.

.

I dunno how the leveling up system would would work, but maybe by doing different things with your speed, you could tap into the Speed Force and learn new abilities.",1493597166

"numenera","t5_2w096","GMing is a subtle and difficult thing. Becoming a good GM takes a lot of experience, especially bad experiences, to know how to run a great game. There's no one way to be a great GM.

I think your best move in all of this is admitting failure and persevering. It's easy to blame others or table flip your way out of a bad game.

Player agency is a term that gets thrown around a lot. Your first game it sounds like your players being able to play their characters was denied to them, being unable to avoid being snuck up on or avoid being robbed or their abilities being ineffectual. Being denied in one way is okay, being denied in all ways is frustrating. Your second game the players got to make choices that affected the game, them having the gumption to put cyphers together to get past a problem is exactly how cypher system/Numenera is supposed to work.

It sounds like the bad guy was supposed to steal the artifact from the PC. The biggest sign that you are going down the wrong path is when you start declaring verbs in your session plans. Your players might not even meet a person, they might not even go to that town. A good piece of advice I've heard is ""Don't write plot, set up situations"". Making a player immune bad guy who teleports out of a scenes at will is a way to get your players to revolt.

Coming up with medium sized problems that they can have an impact on, that aren't a cake walk, can be difficult to tune, but it is the heart of player agency. 

Don't fixated on bad sessions, learn from them and roll with the punch, but hang in there.",1493597166
"politics","t5_2cneq","Not sure what the ratio of helped vs hurt is nation wide to be fully honest. 

For reform mainly I would do an actual cost control. Right now its set up to cap insurance company profits, with the idea that Hospitals would receive payment for all patients and start charging less with insurance companies negotiating lower payments. Problem is that insurance companies are able to keep 20% of that pie, so they have no motivation to negotiate lower prices. If anything the more expensive health care gets, the more money an insurance company now stands to make; especially now that everyone has to do business with them regardless. 

Top that off with high deductible/HSAs being the norm, we now have a way that someone who is insured might still not be able to afford to pay for the care they received; meaning hospitals may still have to perform free procedures, and may need to raise prices accordingly. 

So to fix this, deductibles need to be tied to total income as a percentage value for the year to make sure that people have a chance to pay them, and hospitals/clinics need to post actual costs and present them to patients during a visit. Treat it like any other service, quote on a job ect.

Insurance companies need to have their profit dropped to a lower percentage, and incentivized to provide better value to their customers via tax breaks that would allow them to exceed their new lower cap.  So basically encourage them to better do their job.",1493597166

Sputnik: Russia Has Proof of Yatsenyuk’s Involvement in Chechnya Executions in 1995

&gt; Russia’s Investigative Committee has evidence of former Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk's involvement in execution and torture of Russian servicemen during the hostilities in the Russian region of Chechnya in 1995, the committee’s spokeswoman Svetlana Petrenko said Saturday.
&gt; 
&gt; MOSCOW (Sputnik) — Petrenko added that the investigative committee intended to seek the conviction of Yatsenyuk in accordance with the Russian legislation, using all legal instruments of the international law.
&gt; 
&gt; “The committee has evidence that Ukraine's former Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk participated in at least two armed conflicts on the Minutka square in Grozny city on December 31, 1994 and on February, 1995, while he was also involved in torture and execution of captured Russian servicemen in the Oktyabrsky district of Grozny on January 7, 1995,” the spokeswoman said.
&gt; 
&gt; In March, a court in Russia's southern Yessentuki city ordered the arrest in absentia of Yatsenyuk. Ukraine's justice and foreign ministries have opposed the move. On Friday, Russian Prosecutor General's Office sent a request to Interpol to put Yatsenyuk, who resigned from office in April 2016, on the international wanted list.
&gt; 
&gt; In 2015, the head of the Russian Investigative Committee, Alexander Bastrykin, said that Russia's investigators had information that Yatsenyuk was a member of several gangs, namely ""Argo"" and ""Viking,"" fighting alongside Chechen militants against Russian troops between 1994 and 1995.

Wentz didn't have a great season, but he definitely flashed the talent that got him drafted so high.  His mechanics issues stood out more because he wasn't playing in an offense that could overcome them.  Plus, awful receiving corps.

"yugioh","t5_2rpe6","I don't know what the rules are when trying to enter a hearthstone tournament, but I'd imagine it isn't absurdly difficult. Do you have to be like a certain rank or better in legend? At low ranks, the game isn't really much of skill, but a pure game of chance, getting good hands and streaks of good matchups to winstreak your way up the ladder. I by no means thought I was particularly good at the game, but I netdecked and made legend while freetoplay the past few months, though I've only played the game for about a year. 

Afterwards, it actually takes effort to rank up beyond just hitting legend, so if you have to be like top 100 legend in your region, it would make sense for it to be difficult, but if you just have to be legend, it isn't that hard. There's no limit on how many people can be legend. If you have to be like a sponsored player, that could also be difficult, but I doubt that's correct, seing as Reynad literally owns tempo storm, so that would kind of be cheating his way into it (""Yeah I'm sponsored by myself."") 

TL;DR I don't know the exact system that they use to allow people into tournaments, but I'd imagine it isn't that hard to enter, winning is certainly difficult though, I don't want to take anything away from the professionals.

lol... it's really not that hard but expect to goof it up a bit.

Also, with Shimano brakes sometimes the fluid migrates up to the reservoir and doesn't want to go back in the lines so they feel spongy. Normally this happens after hard rides where they get hot. You can take the wheel off and rapidly squeeze (more like flick the lever with your finger) until the pads touch - then squeeze once more (not too hard). Stick a nylon tire lever in and push them apart just enough to get the rotor back in (so it drags). Then go ride it down the street and pump the brakes a bit, they should settle back into place and probably feel brand new without a fluid change.

Also, make sure you watch and see both pistons are extending. If one is stuck, then don't try this trick until you unstick the piston. Push them all the way open with a tire lever and hold the one that was moving with a tire lever while you squeeze the brake lever to force the stuck one to start moving.

After 2 years however the fluid definitely needs changing. I change mine once a year, but do the trick I just mentioned a few times, usually after hard rides where I used lots of brakes.

Don't put words in my mouth. Believe it or not, it IS possible to be pro 2a and want responsible carry. No where did I say you should have a license to OWN a gun, I am talking strictly about carrying one. The training doesn't have to be expensive, onerous, or anything like that. Nor did I mention mandatory training or taxes? 

&gt;You're trying to impose a restriction even though you admit that a problem does NOT exist. That's my entire point. The very fact that an innocent bystander getting shot is such a rarity should end the discussion right there. There is no problem, and so there is no solution necessary.

Where did I say it doesn't exist? Are you kidding? It's hilariously easy to find examples of people who are idiots with firearms. By your same logic the fact that many CCWers will never need to use their firearm should be justification for the left that CCW is not necessary, and should be repealed. How did you say it?

How is a guy muzzle sweeping ME MY problem, or any indication the range is shitty? The range is very responsible and there are RSOs for every 8 bays. The fact of the matter is the RSO comes in after he's already swept me. Sure, they'll get a ration of shit for doing it after the fact, but it only takes one joe bob gun owner to sweep with his booger hook on there and have an ND. Unless you are talking about going to a range with ""responsible"" gun owners only, in which case isn't that infringing on the people's 2a rights who don't know how to shoot a firearm responsibly?

"wow","t5_2qio8","like many m+ affixes, this one falls flat on a basic design level, and does some things that you flat out shouldn't do:

- it gets harder the better your damage dealers and tank's gear is
- it completely disables some progression feedback mechanisms. tanks with sick gear can't pull more mobs, dds with sick damage now have a hard cap (since the dot timer is a static second amount) on how much faster they are allowed to kill stuff, etc.
- countering it is done by waiting (which is boring). in fight as well as after a fight.
- its implementation completely ignores various outlier scenarios (like the arcway rat pack) making it almost trivial in some cases, too hard in other cases.
- there's no difficulty curve to the affix for healers (who the affix is probably mostly targeted at). with too many stacks your group just dies and you can't outplay the affix. with too little stacks you can almost ignore it with a bit of aoe healing or hotting. there's only a small wiggle room where you can pull all your cds to keep a group just alive, but that's not enough.

i should make it clear that a lot of affixes have problems like this. people just complain about this one now because it's new and because it results in lower chest counts or depletes (there are affixes that have similar design problems, but they are easy so nobody complains about them, but that doesn't make it right)

there's no hope that blizzard removes or significantly overhauls it. just hope there are small changes to make it slightly more enjoyable and hope that for the next expansion, blizzard lays some ground rules for what these affixes are allowed and not allowed to do.

People who dislike feminism tend to dislike other sorts of groups like BLM, and vice versa.  I don't understand why you think if you apply something universally that means it's nothing; if anything that means it's a bigger, underlying flaw.

&gt;Why are you the one with the double standard?

What?

&gt;If Elizabeth Warren called blacks sub human and has to pray for the strength to not kill them, and the Dems were ok with it, I'm done calling myself a Democrat.

What is happening?

&gt;Second of all, I am pro civil rights movements, I support Obama's policies and his statements on race, I support affirmative action and even reparations.

The point is though is that you think of yourself as an individual.  For the most part you aren't, but that individuality is the biggest part of your life.  You have the privilege to be for Civil Rights now but years ago when that was new, you almost couldn't be in public.  Supporting affirmative action and reparations is a comfortable position to take too, and at one point it wasn't that way.  It's the same thing with feminism.  Everyone's okay with the first wave of feminism now, but you can still find old cartoons calling them hags. It's the same thinking.  In 50 years people will be defending feminism of this era to use it against the feminism of that era.  Maybe ""fourth wave"".  This is a pattern that keeps repeating, hence my other point.

&gt;Maybe you need to figure out your racial bias.

I do, as do we all.  You need to figure out yours too.  Everyone does.  I don't understand the negativity.

&gt; The lesson form ETH/ETC is the market choose at the end and the currency will be stronger.

Bitcoin is a money that lives and dies by the network effect.  Ether is a nerd toy's fuel that is subject to their dictator's whims. There is almost zero resemblance to investors.

"PantheonMMO","t5_2zmi9","You can find this information and more in our Q&amp;A: http://www.pantheonmmo.com/game/faqs/

Since we are focussing on PvE for our game, you will find PvP on separate servers where we can tweak and balance both styles of gameplay with affecting each other.

Specifically:

**16.0 Will there be PvP?**

Pantheon is primarily a PvE (player vs. environment) game. In fact, when we say ‘environment’, we don’t just mean NPCs, but also contending with climates and atmospheres, the very world itself. That said, we understand that a portion of our target audience also enjoys player vs. player. Our experience is that separate PvE and PvP shards is the answer, however it is too early to predict how many PvP shards we would launch with. That being said, we will definitely launch with at least one player vs. player shard. It is also worth mentioning that when we do eventually focus on PvP we will do so such that tweaks and changes to classes and races in order to make PvP more fun will not affect the balance of Pantheon’s PvE experience. As the game grows there could be additional variations of PvP shards and more attention paid to the unique gameplay mechanics associated with PvP.

**16.1 Many games struggle to create unique classes because of the balancing issues that PvP creates. How do you prevent PvP from affecting PvE?**

The issue with balance and PvP vs PvE is not one that is that difficult to solve but it does require planning: you just use different formulas and data - you don't cross your streams. That way, if we need to make Paladins in PvE more powerful, we can do that without disrupting PvP balance. And vice versa.",1493597185

I just have a hard time believing any individual let alone a company would just idly sit on a matter like this without backing themselves and protecting their investment i.e. the group and it's reputation. 

Even if they can't show proof of purchase themselves at least say that you're actively working to get those through other channels to show you're not in the wrong. That would put me at ease and if it riles up the natives even more in the short term then so be it. At least some sort of resolution is in play. 

Ignoring it and hoping it blows over is a terrible idea. To me, that may as well be a concession of guilt to some degree which I'm obviously praying is not the case. 

Regardless, the situation is leaving an unpleasant taste in my mouth and I just want the group to continue, black cloud hanging over them or not. The Lattes are fervent and will always support them and if it means sinking back to nugudom then so be it. It's always about the music to me and not the success which is why I support almost exclusively nugu groups (not saying successful groups don't make good music). 

Maybe I'm just a naive stan but those are my thoughts. ",1493597186
"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","I saw this talked about a lot when the study was originally put out. There are actually some specific problems with the methodology they used, but what I think is more telling is that we've had this discussion so much within the larger academic community, low effort social science like this is just plainly misleading now. On the absolute face of it, I think the ""2:1"" statement is misleading abuse of numbers. That is actually that ~66% of the preferred portfolios were from ""women,"" and ~33% were from ""men.""

But what less trivial is that I think the experimental design introduced another level of conscious bias. That is, the professors who were sent the credential portfolios are smart enough to know that they were involved in an experiment. And I don't think it takes much meditation to realize when it's about discriminatory bias when you get a bunch of anonymized portfolios that *don't* anonymize gender. It was overtly an experiment, and I think we can expect that then those who were subject to the experiment ""corrected"" or ""overcorrected"" for bias (if we even assume there was bias in the first place). This makes the general problem with this kind of research that it is very hard not to condition certain kinds of responses through the broader context of gathering your data. Of course, this is general problem often encountered in social psyhology research, and it can be overcome. But my feelings about this particular study is that it is structured so strongly around controlled comparison that it actually mistakes what it purports to measure.

However, what I think might be more important is that in reflecting on the struggle establishing equality in the academy, we should recognize that it doesn't all boil down to hiring decisions for tenure-track positions. In fact, the very context of this survey indicates that limitation. For an advancing academic, to be hired on as a tenure-tract professorship is the last hiring you'll ever experience. In so many words, it is the last leg of your career. Depending on your field, there's at least 10 to 12 years of previous work, applications, evaluations, and ""life"" that brought you to this point. And as people talk about the barriers in STEM (and elsewhere), those obstacles are things like getting into graduate programs, finding mentors and advisers, grant applications, and competitive post-docs. The list goes on. So, even if we were to believe that in the final lap, professors rate female applicants higher than male applicants, the reality then is that our problems are elsewhere in society.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Well if you have microcells anyway, why choose low frequency over high frequency? Low frequency drops off slower so there is more noise with adjacent cells, and less capacity. Still better to use high frequencies which are unlicensed, especially for that. 

There is a reason why people with degrees and engineers plan the spectrum usage. If you'd like, I can discuss it with you, over phone would be easier. PM me. I'll explain why it makes more sense. 

If we did, even if each cell is only 100 feet range, three people per 100 feet isn't enough still. There is so little bandwidth. You can transmit about 8 times as much data on a 2.4 gigahertz band of 5 megahertz wide, then you can of 100 megahertz at 5 megahertz wide. On top of that, with lower frequencies, you have less frequency reuse, because the signals drop off much slower, limiting your bandwidth on adjacent cells. You're supposed to use low frequencies for long range, and high frequencies for short range. If you use low frequencies for low range, you are wasting opportunity for bandwidth that could be used for long range, and nobody can use that spectrum for long range now. It's better to push unlicensed 2.4 spectrum for long range wifi up to a quarter mile, which is actually useable, with a modest amount of bandwidth. 5mhz on the 100mhz band doesn't get anywhere close to as far. 5 megahertz might give you maybe 2 megabits per second, which means you're sharing that among everyone else. At least when you're talking about the 700 megahertz band 12, you can use 5 megahertz and get usable signal, like a good 30 megabits per second. That bandwidth is basically only good for radio broadcasting, it's barely even usable for video.",1493597188

Having done that, that it could not be found again is no surprise given, as you say, the size of the ocean, but to have vanished in the first place, from airspace reasonably frequently used and monitored by both civil and military aviation tracking, that is where the mystery lies.

"apple","t5_2qh1f","Frequently there are essential elements that are written in JavaScript. Say, a dropdown menu (not all of them are written purely in CSS). And by turning js off, guess what happens, you can no longer navigate throughout the site. And that's just one of the countless examples. You simply cannot edit the code on every single page you happen to be browsing. If a page's core function is somehow written with js, how would you be able to use the page without it? And it doesn't require the majority of the website to be that way for it to become a bad idea to turn off js altogether, it can simply be just a tiny thing here and there to affect your web surfing. Lots websites don't just use css for layout and styling, but also heavily rely on js to control the changes. Heck, even main contents can be from the js itself. Anyone with basic understanding of web development would know just how much stuff you can break by turning js off entirely.

The volume buttons will be on the right side and power on the right with the fingerprint scanner in it like sony does.

Give the screen the G6 treatment to shrink the bezels and fill up the front of the phone more. Make the size of the camera lens smaller and add a flash. Get rid of logo under screen.

Add sensors for moto display.

Scale the phone to so it has a 5.3"" screen.

The display will be a 1440p super amoled from Samsung with HDR.

Internal speaker components will be from the HTC m9. 

Headphone jack on the bottom along with USB C port. The phone will have quad DAC from v20 and viper4android preinstalled so you don't need root to use it.

IR blaster up top.

The back will be flat and have moto mods.

Will run the latest android and be mostly stock except for sound customization, native substratum support, and moto custom gestures and customizations.

Use snapdragon 835 SOC.

4GB RAM

Dual cam setup on the rear. One from the pixel, and the other the g6 wide angle.

Dash Charging

64GB, 128GB, and 256GB UFS2.1

SD card slot.

ip68

AM/FM radio

As much battery you can fit while keeping width under 7.5mm

I would point out many many decades too late. 

It will be interesting to see how the church handles the recent scandal in Australia. It has an opportunity to demonstrate that it has changed, or that it hasn't.

Alakazam: 

I love Alakazam, so I find it hard to get rid of them, but I would transfer C/DG. It has lower iv's and not too usable currently. Psycho cut fills charge bar so fast, and I feel like the Focusblast one is the best one you have. Alakazam has such high dps that it can eat through Snorlax and damage blissey well too. It resists their psychic moves, and focusblast is super effective against normals. It's useful for sure. If you want futuresight, it's awesome. But I don't think think it would be a mistake to power up your focusblast one up. I would keep the PC/DG one just in case of move re-roll in the future. 

Arcanine: 

I would transfer #'s 2 and 4. Power up #1. 

Exeggutor:

I would max out #2. Its the most useful. It shreds vapes. I wouldn't transfer the others, because they are still useful.  Seed bomb is best for defending, but it's much better with confusion, but zh isn't too bad. 

Jolteon:

Thunderbolt is superior, so I would definitely power it up. Thunder is still good, so I would keep it too. 

Jynx: 

Maybe keep #1. Ice punch is no avalanche, but it's okay. I wouldn't power it up though. Evolve some smoochum and wait for one with avalanche, then power that one up. The other two, I'd transfer.  

Snorlax: 

Of course keep #1. Numbers 2 and 3 are too high in my area for prestiging with. But I keep all mine until double candy events, then transfer them.  But that's up to you. I never use Snorlax for attacking, but some people like it. #4 is the best cp in my area for prestiging, but I never prestige with them.  

Vaporeon:

Power up 1 and 3 to at least 30,  or max. I'd use hydropump for offense, aqua tail for defense. But that's my preferences. Others prefer AT on offense. They're versatile. ",1493597199

Again, you're making up numbers. The risk is 1% for a 42 year old, not even 2%. A 35 year old, which you've been using as a basis for your arguments, has a 0.25% chance, not 2%. That's miniscule in the grand scheme of things and not something that should take precedence over a parent feeling ready to have a child.

&gt;You don't even have kids, you speak from complete ignorance.

No I'm not. I'm citing actual science, you're citing your personal experience and made up bullshit. You are coming from a place of feelz, I'm coming from a place of realz. Sure, some 35 year olds like your ex will have a tough birth, just like some 25 year olds will. 

The point is that the difficulty of an average pregnancy at 35 compared to an average 25 is largely insignificant, yet you think a woman at 35 is decrepit, barren, and useless. Just not scientifically true.

I can't do basic calculations according to you yet everything you've posted has been emotional internet whinging that has no basis in fact. All of a sudden you changed your story completely from ""anything over 30 is too old!!!"" to ""she meets him at 35 and it takes 4 years to have babies so now she's 39"" when I presented you with facts as to why your argument is wrong and that 38 is the age range that *starts* to generate concern. Pathetic. Even TRP would be disappointed in you. At least admit you fucked up.

There's also studies that a father's age is linked to higher incidences of autism and schizophrenia just like mother's age is linked to higher incidence of Down's Syndrome.

It is an absolute certainty that the criminal justice system has executed innocent people.  So if innocence is your argument in support of life, then you should oppose the death penalty as well.

- Underdeveloped characters. The new actors playing Scott, Jean, Nightcrawler, and Angel are fine, but they don't bring anything memorable to the characters and neither does the writing. Jubilee does nothing. Havok exists only to get blown up and forgotten. Psylocke has no characteristics beyond looking ridiculous.

One thing you have to consider is that Ferguson was on a whole different scale than the Berkeley protests. I'm not excusing things, but there was a fire set to a barricade, and some windows were broken, and a few people got pepper sprayed or hit with things. Definitely bad, but it was a relatively short frenzy. Looking at the wikipedia page for Ferguson, it was protracted enough to be described in multiple *waves*. Berkeley's response is at least partially in the hopes that things *don't* get to the level of Ferguson. 

There might be sympathy for BAMN, I'm not sure. I find it unlikely that people who go into law enforcement are sympathetic towards ""first against the wall"" type people, but I could be wrong.

 The main reason I jumped into the discussion is to defend UCB. UCB doesn't deserve to get funding cut because of Arreguin.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","So Malazan taught me a lot. I grew as a reader in many ways. I had to go out of my comfort zone on a lot of things to read and enjoy it. Off the top of my head: 


1. Not knowing what's going on, or basically trusting the author 2. Skipping around continents and therefore characters. 3. Military fantasy. 4. Honestly just committing to a large series 


Probably others as well but having come out the other side, I can tell you, it was all worth it. I went out of my comfort zone and pretty much just found a much broader comfort zone. I love all those things listed now (VERY much) and they have opened up a lot more fantasy for me. If there's any author to trust in taking you out of the ol comfort zone, I promise you, you couldn't do better than Erikson. It *always* pays off.

s6 Mundo OTP, at one point boasting a 80% wr on him

This will be addressing the jungle Mundo, i can answer top questions but I mained him jungle since it's more fun.

He is a skirmisher, decent duelist, sustainy bruiser. He does decent aoe but is best focusing one person down in a 2v2 or potentially 1v1.

Cinderhulk, always. Usually go machete first with triple pots if you think you can get away with a full clear, otherwise go refillable and sell it in the midgame. If you plan to do Raptors into wolves or something, start talisman. Then rush Cinderhulk and get t1 boots. Here depends on your situation of how well you are doing and what you can do. almost every time you can, build PD. The now-somewhat-
famous Mundo (twitch.tv/mundo_stream) and i have been building it for quite some time. It's not troll, every stat it gives is great. If you can't afford to go it then titanic hydra is fine. Then straight tank, finish ninja tabis UNLESS you need mercs. Then, DMP if you want to run down carries, Randuins for fed crit users, ZZ'rot for pressuring sidelanes, SV if they have AP, Warmogs if you want to breifly skirmish, then sustain quickly and fight again, and Banshees if they have ap (SV is always a first). I wouldn't recommend ZZ'Rot or Warmog's as your first tank item. It's pretty flexible, so don't worry if you aren't needing any MR, you don't always need a SV.

Start Q for Blue, E for red (although I start Red almost every game) and W for raptor start. Then go either q or e (whichever you didn't take first/depending on next camp) then whatever skill you don't have level 3. Max R&gt;E&gt;Q&gt;W EVERY game. E max is 100% the best  imo. Both your Q and E hit camps hard, and E does a lot of damage to enemies and the most to towers. If someone ever tells you to do W max, ignore them because it kills all your ganking potential because you do far to much damage to yourself.

His first massive spike is at 6, followed by completion of Cinderhulk, then finishing PD then 11, those are his most notable spikes

12/0/18 with grasp almost every game, stoneborn can work but relies a lot more on your team to carry. AS quints are absolute core, the best. I find standard armor yellows and mr blues are fine. reds can be AD or AS, i prefer AD.

He synergizes with engage or counter engage, as well as strong 2v2 skirmishers that he can fight with and go off on

Grievous wounds are the reason he isn't LCS viable. AD MUST get executioner's, a mid cannot reliably burst him down to use morello by itself to cut his healing. ignite him in fights the majority of the time. If Mundo gets behind he gets FUCKED. Life gets so hard for him, because mundo is literally all tank/sustain and damage that can stick onto targets well. Putting him down early can take him out for almost the whole game

Ones the most artistic, creative little shit ever. She gets anxious and tries to put up walls, we try to get her to see that you need bridges to escape when the walls collapse. Still we need her and she needs us. She's also very survival driven, and occasionally violent. She has tackled me in public, but no one said anything since she's this little pixie-like blond. 

One is a bit larger than all of us, militaristic. It's her dream to become a marine, and anyone who gets in the way is fucked. She's also very honest and defensive of us, and she knows where the lines are. 

Then there's the third. She's a dancer and a singer, she can be a bit dark and insensitive but we love her anyway, and she's also somehow the best at comforting people. She's the kind of person that people just naturally love, and she's likely to be famous one day. 

And me... Well I guess that it's hardest to describe yourself. I'm a bit creative, good at a few mediums of art. I'm considered ""the intelligent one"", and I just love information and learning and actually applying that, but I'm not a ""nerd"" in the traditional sense. 

It's crazy, very soon after meeting each other we just clicked. We're so different, yet also so similar. I couldn't ask for better friends, and I'm not going to anytime soon.

"archeage","t5_2sf59","Many of these quests are event quests that aren't turned on or older quests that got removed over time. I don't think they ever really gave a reason why they continue to be tracked. My assumption is that because ArcheAge services multiple regions, many small differences in-between them fall through the cracks. 

Another thing is just ArcheAge's tendency to hold onto old functionality and items rather than discard them. There are various trinkets, items, and even lore-related artifacts you can find in the world that don't actually serve their proper purpose anymore. 

My hope is that they're being held so that they can be revisited some day, but it's far more likely that they were just forgotten. Not only is ArcheAge quite large but the game went through some severe revisions in its early stages as it tried to figure out what its players wanted. It technically started development in 2006, so it could even be that the people who worked on those parts aren't actually on the team anymore.

I can't find my copy, but based on the table of contents I dug up online I'm pretty sure the story in question is D.R. Smith's short story Why Abdul Alhazred Went Mad.  

It is from the perspective of Alhazred himself, then only a cultist, and he witnesses a battle between some Roman leader and Cthulhu?  Nyarlathotep?  It's been a while but it ends with the leader killing it and tearing out its heart.  I remember the story breaking down around then as the author decends into madness, saying something to the effect of:  ""He ate the heart.  He ate it!  The heart of the god and he ate it!""  Does that sound right with what you remember?

The book runs about 20$ I think, but if I can find it in my library I'll copy over the story in question and post it up here.  I'll report back tomorrow if I do find it tonight.",1493597219

In some cases, when they do it is complicated as it is religion mixed with nationalism and liberation. You are quite right to call out people like Nawaz Sharif, but the problem in places like Pakistan is more structural as the fundamental feudal structure of society hasn't really changed. Until, the government addresses it seriously, the inequality and disparity isn't going away, which is often the reason for extremism.

If it only takes 30 minutes to tell if a game sucks, that's more telling on the game than the reviewer. If their experience was so bad in that first 30mins that they don't ever want to go back and play it what does that say?

I'm all for putting 10x the money into a legal system that can prevent **innocent** people from facing capital punishment. I understand that our complicated legal system is designed to protect everyone, even if that means using trickery and doubt to get a Not Guilty verdict, and that's fine. But, in my world, being complicit in a Capital Crime is a Capital Offense.

Like that Mumia guy - I've read his story over and over. Not his gun, he didn't shoot first, it was his brother - I'm just grasping at weak memories, the details aren't important.

"Fallout_RP","t5_3jrfi","Vince had hit the road southeast after a couple days in Goodsprings, his attention span drained. The sun was high and beating down on him, sweat rolling off his forehead. “You’d think without hair I wouldn’t have to worry about sweat as much, but *noooo,*” said Vince as he wiped his forehead off. He could see the air rippling above the asphalt, slowly baking it as the day got older. The only good thing about this western heat is that it wasn’t near as humid as his hometown back east, though this dry air made his already rotting flesh uncomfortable.

Despite all this, Vince continued on, his new .357 lever-action repeater resting against his right shoulder, which both sides were hunched over as if carrying a great weight. He grabbed the flask of firewater that was in his inner coat pocket and took a long swig as he walked down the barren road. Eventually he saw something that caught his attention, a tower of sorts surrounded by a fence. As Vince rounded the corner he saw the whole facility, for that was what it was, a large facility out in the middle of nowhere. It looked like a small prison, and Vince had spent enough of his life around prisons to know, or at least, he thinks he has, it’s getting hard to remember that far back.

Vince approached the front without a care in the world, trying to remember the name of the song stuck in his head as he hummed it. He noticed the NCR Trooper guarding the front door right away. The trooper looked bored and wasn’t paying Vince much attention as he approached. Vince said something along the lines of, “may I go in?” but he wasn’t paying himself that much attention at that point either. Not like it mattered since the trooper didn’t bother to stop Vince from walking into the visitor’s center. There were a few NCR troopers lounging around the tables, drinking and playing card games. They barely looked up at the new arrival as Vince walked through. *Well,* he thought, *if they’re gonna ignore me, then I’m gonna ignore the bastards too and see how they like it!*

Once outside in the courtyard, Vince stopped, not real sure what to do now. The yard was a buzz of activity as people went to and fro, working on getting everything repaired. Vince just stood in the middle, twisting this way and that as he watched the workers do their thing. He had a stupid grin on his faces as he hummed, thinking, *why am I here again?*

I managed to pull through, and I think I did pretty well, but man the second I turned my test in my head was on the desk. 

All I can remember is the thoughts going through my head: something about a jacket being green like her marijuana, and that the smaller chameleons didn't like having their chins rubbed by toothbrushes, while the larger ones did. 

I wrote the garbled words ""the chameleons object to toothbrush rubbing"", on the back of my notebook and, satisfied with my work, promptly fell asleep. When I woke up to one of my friends shaking me awake and telling my that the test was done, I looked at my notebook and saw, to my horror, those words written in pen on the back of my notebook. 

And the kicker? That was the notebook for the class of one of the scariest teachers in our school. This school did regular binder and notebook checks (junior high, so they, while pretending not to give a shit, gave all the shits), so I'm lucky that that particular teacher didn't find those words. 

Writing them down wasn't ""bad"", per se, but their discovery would have definitely resulted in a serious stare down. ",1493597228

"anime","t5_2qh22","### Episode the 12th
End of Evangelion! I kid, I kid. I could see how people could make the comparison though. This episode starts right where the previous one left off, Madoka's wish: To be granted the power to erase witches past/present and future. Now my initial guess for Kyubey's goal was that he wanted to raise humanity/a human to godhood (Specifically Madoka). Upon learning his actual goal I discounted this, now imagine my surprise in learning that her wish actually allowed her to become a god! A lot of you probably saw it coming. But wow. This was quite a big twist for me. 

Seeing Madoka speak with such positivity and hope and the agreement from Kyoko and Mami really gave me those warm fuzzy feels. Throughout the series I was sceptical towards Madoka becoming a magical girl. I didn't know if I wanted it to happen or not. And it seems it's both a positive and a negative. On one hand her becoming ""hope"" for all magical girls and easing their despair was beautiful to witness, it's a wonderful achievement and extremely fitting of Madoka. Taking the burden of all girl's pain so incredibly selfless, I'm glad she accomplished her noble wish. But on the other hand it means Madoka no longer exists...and that's left me kind of grief-stricken. 

I'm a bit lost for words in regards to the scene in space, my brain's still struggling to digest it. If I'm correct Madoka's powers forced the universe to rewrite itself, and Kyubey seems to think that her eventual despair from her wish will destroy a universe? But this is countered by the wish itself because it made it impossible for her to become a witch, right? Kyubey then explains that Madoka has ascended to another plain and written herself out of existence. Initially I reacted the same way Homura did, surely Madoka doesn't deserve this? Why's she the one who has to sacrifice herself? Madoka may have secured a brighter future for magical girls, but at what cost to herself? I don't want to see her disappear...

I think Madoka's floating space weirdness was arguably the most touching scene in the series for me. The dialogue is so well done in this scene, the way it flits between happiness and despair, Madoka and Homura. Madoka's acceptance of Homura's deeds. Queue the waterworks. At least I got a little bit of closure by hearing Sayaka come to terms with her destiny, just before Madoka takes her to magical girl heaven? I'm still a little unsure. And after that...this series punches me completely in the gut. The fact that Mami and Kyoko can't remember Madoka, the fact that it's just her brother and Homura left with memories of her. Not even her mother remembers her existence. This just seemed so depressing to me, it turned the trickle down my cheek into a stream. FUCK THIS SCENE WAS TOO SAD. I really didn't need this, 'specially after yesterday. It's a small comfort to me that Homura is fighting in Madoka's memories, fighting because of her ideals. But I suppose that's the nature of this series. 

Which brings me on to the end. It's left me emotionally spent and at moments it had me crying. something I didn't think an anime series could do. it's quite the feat. We're left with this rather melancholy ending, one that I think is suitable for this series. Did I want it to end this way? Nope. Do I think it's a fitting ending? Most definitely. Every single moment of this series was an incredible ride, the few ups, the numerous downs, all great. it's more than earned its place among my top five series. Take my 10/10 Madoka Magica, you've earned it. I'll be back for Rebellion (Very curious to see where this movie goes) and the overall series discussion, thank you to all the people who've read my poorly written and planned thoughts over this rewatch.

The trauma that turns Finn is probably something many other Stormtroopers have gone through. I think, The Order may be experiencing a ""civil"" war of attrition within the ranks of soldiers on the inside that awaken and are preemptively caught because of Finn's ""journey"". This could be hidden from the viewer. It may be a flaw within The Order's programming that will cause them to lose more stormtroopers over time. Only to be countered by swift changes and coverups. Killing the stormtroopers in my eyes is a way of ending their ""mental slavery"". I like to think Finn was the beginning of that end.

I watched a scene recently where the actors were fixing their gaze intently in the appropriate spot, but I found it unnerving because at that point in the scene, they were just at the flirting stage and it would have been more realistic to be glancing at me, then looking down, looking at each other, then back to me.  As the flirting progresses, people naturally move their eyes into a triangle pattern of both eyes and mouth, occasionally glancing down to chest or groin. Only after they progress to full-on romantic or sexual advance do they intently stare into each other's eyes.

Here is an interesting article on the topic: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3028929/Tracey-Cox-five-eye-contact-tricks-man-s-attention-spot-s-interested-you.html

"imaginarymaps","t5_2vqof","This is the year 10583. Civilizations have risen and fallen and countless apocalypse-level catastrophes have happened many times over in the 11,000 years since 2017. If anything, this future more closely resembles a high-tech version of the dark ages; absolutist monarchs and decedent oligarchs, widespread illiteracy amongst politically-disenfranchised under classes, political chaos and a reemergence of feudal structures (feudalism made something of a comeback during the Second Empire's golden era of interstellar colonization, due to the vast distances involved and the limits of communications technology).

So that's the backdrop.

The actual posthumans, well, they're just as flesh-and-blood as you or I, and are just as flawed. Some are actually more prone to aggression and tribalism (e.g: Noaptes and Thuktuun'illi). Furthermore, in an age of human morphological diversity, biology becomes as much of an aspect of one's identity as language, culture or nationality. For the most part, people are unwilling to live next to beings that are THAT different from them in so many ways. There are certain exceptions, though. The Third Empire is a vast interstellar feudal empire that incorporates thousands of human species under the grand meme of there being a ""greater human family"" (though even that is underpinned by nationalism). But the Sol System has not been part of the Empire for over 3,000 years now.",1493597231

All that running and taming, for 10 feet. I reloaded and it was gone. Fuck that dudes wife. Expect my ass to use chryosis to travel down river when he can swim. Stop being such a whiney bitch, get off your ass and go look for her. I came back later to grab some weapons I didn't have room for at the time and decided to look around the reservoir. Nothing.

"overlord","t5_2tvlr","Perhaps, but Tsuare had nothing to do with Nazarick and the situation is entirely different.

Touch me is a moralfag, thus making the point still not matter. He wouldn't betray his friends and everything he has made because his friend killed people for the sake of what they created together. As you said, he has morals. You're basing pretty much everything off assumptions that you know how the characters really are when either of us could be right or wrong.

""At one point in time there existed a goblin king, wielding the Branch of Tonelico, a powerful magic item which he used to slay countless dragons.""

It's also very assumptious to think there can be a plan against against Victim and tgoalid, and even more so that Ainz wouldn't have a counter measure against that as well. The entire reason Ainz was ever good at pvp was because of his forethought and planning, as well as knowledge of his opponent. Which this time around is one of his friends he knows best. It's not a legitimate cause to just believe ""it will happen, or it will work"" because the same can be applied to the opposing side.

Edit: Also you ignored half of what I said. There aren't many other supreme beings who would agree with Touch Me, the vast majority are evil aligned or care more about Nazarick like Ainz does.
Also the entire point behind Albedo's death squad is to prevent stuff like this and out of hate for the other SBs. Touch Me very well could just be killed by her and Rubedo before even meeting or learning about what Ainz has even done.",1493597232

"htpc","t5_2rbfy","&gt; HDMI to Samsung TV =&gt; TV optical out to receiver.

This is your problem.  Optical is your limitation, as that's SPDIF and SPDIF only supports 2-channel PCM.  You'd have the same problem if you used HDMI ARC from your TV to your receiver, because ARC also only supports SPDIF.  Furthermore, many TVs won't even allow you to bitstream AC3 or DTS (being 6-channel formats that can compress into two channels of PCM bandwidth), even though technically they could pass that through unmolested to the receiver.

Your real solution is to go HTPC DisplayPort -&gt; DP to HDMI adapter (assuming this isn't also a bottleneck -- it may very well be) -&gt; AVR -&gt; TV.  If your receiver doesn't support HDMI input, then it's time to upgrade.

The volume issue is also by design.  Bitstreaming means that the PC isn't touching the audio. It's simply passing through the signal for the AVR to decode.  Which means you can't do any manipulation of that audio -- no volume, no spatial effects, no loudness normalization, etc.  You can ""mute"", because muting doesn't modify the stream -- it stops it.",1493597236

Today, talking to someone is easy as a phone call. You can order food delivered at your door. You have all of these applications that do everything for you.

It's amazing how many people are on their phones and have to be plugged in all the time. We are living in a world where we can now completely cut out people who have different opinions than we do and associate only with those that think like it. Technology has allowed us live in echo chambers where we actually don't learn principles of tolerance and opposing worldviews.

A lot of anxiety comes from having a want and not being able to get it. People in today's world are so bombarded with tons of crap. You have to look like this. You have to buy this car. You have to wear this dress, etc. It's amazing how much influence popular media has on people. You have more people following celebrities on Twitter than actually voting in elections.",1493597240
"Psychonaut","t5_2qplv","Your and my view of the universe are similar, except we interpret and express it in different ways. 

I view it very similarly, except the labels are different. What you call 'God', I call 'Seed/Source'. And existence in its entirety grows from this 'Source' as a tree would grow from its seed. And then galaxies and planets and entities and all that wonder and awe flourishes and blossoms. 

Then there's the ""nothingness"", which in my view is pure, unadulterated consciousness. Primordial awareness. It's the ""silent observer"", which identifies itself with whatever it hosts. If it has nothing to host, like a body and mind, and perhaps even a soul, then there is no ""I"" that it experiences, because it is nothing at all and has nothing to identify with. 

So, from my view, these are a couple parts of the all of existence: The Source, and the Universes and Planes it grows into. Then the ""Nothingness"" - Pure Consciousness that allows this Source and the beings that grow from it to identify themselves as whatever they are, and to recognize that they exist.

I guess that was the 'nothingness' I meant to express haha",1493597240

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","&gt; they can still be necessary to achieve some non-economic goal if that goal is deemed more important than the negative economic impact of the tariff

That is true, preferences are normative, but whenever this argument is used it should be taken with a huge grain of salt. For example, ""national security"" today is a bullshit argument for protectionism generally. Yes people can invent scenarios where we absolutely have to have say a shipping industry that is already developed in the case of a major conflict (its not like we have ever built industries from scratch with existing skills from economic depression in the face of worldwide conflict /s) but that can be said for anything. 

For agricultural subsidies, people can make up arguments that if the world went though a total drought then we need a buffer, or other food security arguments, but those are generally bullshit. The US is a net exporter of food and our industry in incredibly productive. we don't need protection

And it can get annoying when the people arguing for protectionism have far more expertise on the subject and are better placed to make up these arguments but they also have a huge self interest in protectionism. And more than free trade globally, that is why things like ridiculous licensing laws still exist. 

So yes, protectionism can be good to satisfy some normative goal not related to economic prosperity. Even Milton Friedman acknowledged this. But in general, we should be very careful when attempting something like that. And we should also acknowledge that the people most knowledgeable about the industry are also generally self interesting in preserving that industry, even when in the interests of free trade it might be better off dead.

My personal experience: Pretenting that certain things are not happening at all ""out there"" will not work, however: What you are making of it will be decided in your mind by yourself. Only you can do this. And this is a good thing. (SEELE wants the opposite, and this is obviously a bad thing...I think Shinji realizes this just in time in EoE...and I think this might even be the *actual* connection between the TV ending and EoE...)

""Weird anime comparisons"" are my speciality as many of you already know XD - and I learned from Madoka Magica that trying to turn everything and anything upside down and inside out will only cause a lotta trouble - however trying to make the best of it without corrupting yourself, which isn't at all too easy way too often, is better or at least the lesser evil.

"BasicIncome","t5_2v1jk","&gt;So you are saying that the LVT and the UBI would somehow be balanced?

Yes.

&gt;How does that work? Because not all land is of equal value, but a universal benefit pays the same across the board.

Those who use the more valuable land pay more for it. Those who use the less valuable land pay less for it.

Someone for whom UBI is their only income won't be able to afford any arbitrary parcel of land. They may not even be able to afford one standard-sized lot in a big city. But that's okay, they'll just move out of the city to where land is cheaper, and they'll rent a parcel of the size they can afford while leaving some income for other things. In the meantime, those who rent the expensive land in big cities will have to pay more, but they will be the people who also have other sources of income and can afford that land.

It doesn't balance out on a per-person basis, but it balances out across the entire economy. Essentially, we're dividing up the *value* of the world's land into (more or less) equal-sized chunks, one for each person. And then those who *actually use* less land (as measured by value) than the size of their allotted chunk end up with a corresponding net income from the UBI, and those who choose to use more than the size of their allotted chunk end up paying a higher rent than their UBI. The land rent flows from the more intensive land users to the less intensive land users, *in exchange for* what is essentially a 'loan' of the land itself from the less intensive users to the more intensive users.",1493597241

"penspinning","t5_2ryre","&gt;You're saying someone needs style but why can't their style be doing power tricks?   

No, please read my post very carefully, that is precisely what I'm not saying. Maybe I should have not used the term ""style"" here because you seem to use it differently. As I said, 

&gt;there's nothing wrong with doing power tricks   

but focusing on learning power tricks often leads to people just quickly learning trick after trick without watching their execution and mastering individual tricks.   

&gt;Are you implying that you will not be able to control your pen because it's heavy?   

No, I have not implied anything like that, please don't put words in my mouth. Spinning heavy pens often means that you will not be able to spin lighter pens properly later on. That is not necessarily a problem but as I've said in my original post: This route of learning penspinning often correlates with people not watching their execution, not mastering tricks and instead using the ""easier pen"" to learn trick after trick.    

&gt;For that matter what's heavy? Why is it arbitrarily assigned to a KT, Buster, VGG, when they are all different weights?   

What the fuck are you talking about.    

&gt;I'm really curious on how you're going to do a quantitative analysis on something subjective.   

Seriously, what is this? I was talking about a correlation between ""[...]learning only certain tricks and never acquiring style[...]"", that is not something subjective. It's something demonstrable by numbers but I am really telling you this from my personal experience over the years. I've seen spinners come and go and whenever I see someone going down the route of heavy pens and power-tricks, they end up having (among other things) little to no control and a shitty style (which means ""bad microexecution"").    

I am still unsure of what exactly you mean by ""gatekeeping"" but when someone asks for tips on how to git gut fast, I'll tell them to master individual tricks instead of rushing things and spin light pens instead of those that lead to overly focusing on so called power-tricks (even though I would not discourage people to learn those as they can certainly be effective).

Spend the time to go through those Uworld blocks because they really are gold. When I wanted to review a subject during dedicated, I would use a resource and then go through the respective anki deck to make sure I learned it well. For example, you can watch Pathoma Renal and then go through the renal pathology deck right after. You can suspend cards that you feel you won't need to see again in dedicated and then continue cards that you found were more difficult to remember. This will help narrow down the total # of cards so it's not too overwhelming!

Dear Diary:


It was the night of April Fools’ Day in 2006. I was 23 and nursing a drink at a bar on Ludlow Street.


After commuting from my parents’ house for a year, I had finally moved to New York City. It was a playground of cool people and things and culture, and I was awkwardly trying to find my place in it all.


“Do you want to try some fancy mixed nuts?” a guy asked, handing me a can.


I took it, skeptically, and twisted the top open. Out sprang a leopard-print “snake.”


“April Fools!” he said.


It was the kind of gag gift you would find next to whoopee cushions and Precious Moments figurines at a Long Island card store, not at a cool bar on the Lower East Side.


The prankster may have sensed that the snake-in-a-can was my spirit animal. He gave it to me as he left the bar.


I used the gag as an icebreaker for the rest of the night. Most of the conversations were one-sided, but I didn’t care.


“Do you want to try some fancy mixed nuts? … No? O.K.!”


At one point, I walked up to the biggest hipster in the place with my newfound confidence. He was tall, dressed in black and sitting in the corner. Then I recognized him: the musician Jack White. I was about to target the epitome of 2006 New York cool with the corniest April Fools’ Day gag ever.


“Do you want to try some fancy mixed nuts?” I asked.


He looked at me from under his wide-brimmed hat.


“I’ve fallen for that one before,” he said.

Keep in mind, this is the civilization that piggybacked on the advanced from the Greeks and Indians before them. They invented algebra, trigonometry, irrational numbers. This civilization mapped the stars and dominated the world in the collection of knowledge and holding learning in esteem.

This was until Al-Ghazali wrote *The Incoherence of the Philosophers* in the early 12-century. Elite scholars were not affected immediatley, but at the base level of the culture, these teaching demonized scientific pursuits such as astronomy and mathematics. Fast forward a few decades, his teachings then became the fundamental and dominant way of thinking about the hierarchy of science and religion. After Al-Ghazali, the Koran outweighed the pursuit of truth through experimentation, and that steamrolled into heresy and power fell to the Imams and prophets. Later events like corruption, war, and accidents of history, put the civilization, and all of human civilization, into the dark ages.

Why didn’t defenseman Brendan Smith see more ice time in the third period? Why wasn’t the checking line out there in overtime? Why, oh why, do the Rangers keep throwing away almost certain victories in the final minutes of playoff games?


Coach Alain Vigneault faced considerable second-guessing on Sunday, the day after his Rangers blew a two-goal lead late in Game 2 of their playoff series with the Ottawa Senators — and then lost, 6-5, in double overtime.


Vigneault understood that this sort of micro-inspection would be only the beginning if the Rangers persisted in their self-sabotage. He was doing some of it himself, along with members of his staff.


“People have the right to analyze,” Vigneault said during a conference call with reporters. “Right now, we’re in the process of analyzing, and everything is on the table. Minutes are based on how you’re playing, not experience. Not everybody’s game on certain nights is the same.”


The Rangers, now down by two games to none in the Eastern Conference semifinal series, head back to Madison Square Garden for Game 3 on Tuesday knowing not only that they are skating to keep this series alive, but also that many on the roster are playing to stay on this team.


Major changes are certain to be forthcoming if the Rangers drop two more games in such panicky fashion to Ottawa — a club that gave up more goals than it scored during the regular season, that earned fewer points in the standings than the Rangers, and that lacks experience deep in the postseason.


Losing to the Penguins in the conference finals might be an acceptable conclusion to this season for the Rangers. Elimination by the Senators in the second round would not qualify as a success, by anybody’s standard. The team has advanced to the second round or further in five of the last six seasons, an admirable record. But the biological clock is ticking on the extraordinary career of Henrik Lundqvist, the 35-year-old star goaltender.


Despite some very visible mistakes by the Rangers down the stretch on Saturday, Vigneault said he was likely to keep his defensive pairings the same. That did not stop him from blaming defenseman Nick Holden for the 2-on-1 opportunity that led to the Senators’ winning goal by Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Holden overcommitted in the offensive zone, going for a puck he failed to reach.


“If you’re going to pinch and go down, you have to have a high F3 there, unless you’re sure you’re going to get the puck,” Vigneault said, referring to a backup forward. “They were able to get the chip and get 2-on-1 there. It was obviously not the right decision at that time.”


The Rangers’ current predicament clearly isn’t just Holden’s fault. Other players have been too willing to settle for icing the puck while protecting fragile leads, creating dangerous face-offs in their own zone. In addition, Vigneault has seemed at times to lose faith in his younger players, juggling lines and shortening his bench in almost random fashion.


Even the coach admitted there was no particular reason for the brevity of Smith’s appearance in the third period — only 2 minutes 34 seconds.


“We were looking for certain matchups, and sometimes with the flows and the matchups, certain players get lost for a couple of shifts and a couple of minutes,” Vigneault said. “He was playing a good game, playing with bite. It just happened that way.”


Lundqvist was off his usual form in Game 2, allowing a couple of soft goals on shots he normally handles with relative ease. There has also been some luck involved, good and bad. Each of the Senators’ six playoff victories in April has come by exactly one goal. Pageau scored a grand total of 12 goals this season, yet he managed four goals in Game 2 with the help of a couple of seeing-eye deflections in front of the crease.


“Maybe I’ll put a checker on their checker,” Vigneault mused about Pageau. “He’s supposed to be their checker.”


All this leaves the Rangers in a grave situation. They badly need to win the next two games at home, where they have enjoyed little success this season. If they lose on Tuesday, falling into a 3-0 hole, their chances are next to impossible.


Before this postseason began, according to NHL.com, only four teams out of 184 had ever climbed out of such a dire situation. That amounted to 2.2 percent, or about a 1-in-45 chance.


“It was a tough way to lose a game, but it doesn’t mean the series is over,” Ryan McDonagh, the Rangers’ captain, said after Game 2. “We can’t do anything about it now. Just have to hope in the future we find a way to get it done. It stings. It’s a good thing we’ve got two days, because it might take a full day to let this one go.”


Vigneault agreed that he and the team could use the extra day off to figure out exactly what they have been doing wrong.


“There are some areas we can be a little bit better at, show a little more video,” Vigneault said. “Having the extra 24 hours to consume it, adjust in a couple areas, it’s going to be beneficial with our group.”


The N.H.L., too, has much at stake. The league may be headed for a perfect storm of small-market playoff matchups. It is not unlikely that the conference finals will involve teams from Ottawa, Edmonton, Pittsburgh and Nashville. Good for Canada. Not so good for TV ratings in the United States.


This is not a direct concern for the Rangers, of course. They just want to bring another series back to New York, regardless of population size.

I think technically I've changed your based on the topic you posted if you agree to that, but I'd be happy to discuss the policy aspect further.

In regards to policy, Lets start with a few questions:

1) Why do you feel that biology should influence policy?

2) If you *could* control those social pressures, would you? and if so

3) What sex characteristics would you try to select for and why?

4) Do you feel the current system in whatever country you are from is doing a poor job of accounting for sexual dimorphism in humans in their policy?

 - **Wheel of the Infinite** by Martha Wells.  Set in a vaguely eastern, buddhist inspired empire, we follow Maskelle, a priestess whose exact nature is left somewhat mysterious initially, but seems to be in some form of disgrace.  We start with her protecting a troupe of performers who are trying to get rid of a cursed puppet, but she's soon drawn into a deeper threat, as something is wrong with the ceremony recreating the titular wheel of the infinite: a mandala remade by the temple every hundred years that recreates and sustains the world.  It reminded me a little of Bujold's *Paladin of Souls* in a few ways (the protagonist is a middle-aged woman serving a divine power whose job is dealing with demons, and who royally screwed up the last divine task she undertook years ago leading to serious self-doubt issues), and I think anyone who liked that will find a lot to enjoy here.  I think my favourite thing about Wells's books is her world building - she presents wonderfully vibrant worlds that feel alive and lived in, and this is no exception - we get an interesting culture that is both interesting on its own, but still feels like part of a greater world.  Definitely enjoyed this one.

 - **The Spirit Lens** by Carol Berg.  Set in a fantasy world analogous to renaissance era France, this is somewhat reminiscent of Randall Garrett's *Lord Darcy* stories in setting.  The protagonist is a failed sorceror turned librarian who is recruited by the king (a distant kinsman) to investigate an attempted assassination attempt involving magic.  Assisted by a social gadfly and an ill-tempered sorceror, he attempts to unravel the mystery.  This was decent, but it never really gripped me - the pacing felt a bit too slow for me, and while it picked up a little later in the book, ultimately there wasn't really enough payoff to satisfy me.  Of course, part of this is that it's the first book of a trilogy, but not sure I'll continue with it.
 
 - **The Long Way to a Small and Angry Planet** by Becky Chambers.  This is something of a slice-of-life novel, set on an interstellar tunnel building spacecraft and following the crew.  It's very much character rather than plot focused: the title refers to the job they're hired to do, but they don't even reach that point till the last 50 pages.  Instead, the focus is very much on the characters and relationships of the crew, and is done very very well.  I really liked it - definitely something of a comfort read, where you come out feeling that you just had a great time hanging out with a bunch of interesting and (mostly) likeable people.
 
 - **A Closed and Common Orbit** by Becky Chambers.  A loose sequel to *Angry Planet*, this follows two minor side character from the first: Pepper, and one we briefly meet at the end of the first book.  It's told in two interleaved timelines - one set in the past, recounting Pepper's history (something briefly mentioned in the first book, but here expanded greatly), while the other narrative is set after the events of the first.  While it's still very character driven, there's more to the plot here, and I liked this one even more than the first. 
 
 - **Wylding Hall** by Elizabeth Hand.  This follows the members of a 70's british folk band, who have been set up in an old manor by their manager to work on their next album, but where something disastrous seems to have happened.  It's told in a series of interleaved interview style passages by various members of the band and others describing the events long after the fact, as something decidedly creepy seems to have been going on in the ancient house.  
  
 - **The Troupe** by Robert Jackson Bennett.  This follows a 16 year old pianist who is searching for a mysterious vaudeville troupe, whose fourth act no-one seems to remember.  On finding them, things get stranger and he becomes enmeshed in strange events and conflicts.  Loved this one - Bennett reminds me a bit of Tim Powers, but mixed with Lovecraftian cosmic horror.  His worlds are beautiful, dark, disturbing and fascinating to read about.

As far as Bingo goes, *Angry Planet* fits for debut,  AMA author, and probably several others.  I'd actually been going to read *Wheel* last month, but decided to delay it under the suspicion that we might see an ""older protagonist"" square, though it looks like lrich1024 outmaneuvered me with the 50+ specifier there, since I'm not sure she qualifies (I think she's in at least her mid 40s, and could easily be in her 50s, but if there was something that confirmed her age more precisely, I missed it).  *Wylding Hall* maybe fits for horror (though it's a novella, so will probably go for a novel for this).  Possibly *The Troupe* too, though may be using Bennett for the 2017 square, since I'm planning to read his *Divine Cities* books once the third comes out this year.",1493597249

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Essentially, there's 3 types of d20 rolls in D&amp;D (well, 5e at least). Attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. This is how I rule things, at least (not 100% sure how much they agree with RAW, but it works pretty well).

**_Natural 20s are easy._**

**Attack:** The attack hits, even if the grand total (20+attack modifier) doesn't beat the target AC. Double damage die are rolled.

**Saving Throw:** The saving throw succeeds, even if the grand total of the save doesn't make the DC.

**Ability Check:** Ignore the fact that it's a 20. Take the grand total of the ability check. Does that beat the DC you set to make it happen (note, rolling a 20 isn't an automatic success. You're not going to have a 1 in 20 chance of convincing the king to abdicate and proclaim you the new monarch, however high your persuasion skill is).

**_Natural 1's are a little more controversial_**

**Attack:** The attack misses, regardless of whether you hit the target AC or not. No other ill effects are applied.

**Saving Throw:** The save fails, regardless of whether you hit the target DC or not. No other ill effects are applied.

**Ability Check:** I tend to make these rulings much more case-by-case. If you crit fail your persuasion check to get a merchant to lower his prices, he's not going to attack you. He might think you're a little rude, or presumptuous, but that's about it. If you crit fail your acrobatics check to somersault off of the giants knee, over his head, and land behind him, slashing him with your sword as you do so, You're probably ending up prone at the giants feet. Depending on how mean I'm feeling, you might have no movement speed left as well. I think that triggering a mimic to make a surprise attack on a crit failed investigation roll is perfectly reasonable, as I suspect that would involve touching (or at least taking a close look), but a crit failed perception or knowledge check would not (unless they specified that they were taking a close look/touching it).",1493597250

"incremental_games","t5_2yia0","A few observations:

* I think the layout and styling is fantastic. /u/totominc did a fantastic job on the design.
* There are three command line features missing that really ruin this game for me.

 * There's no `history`, so I have to retype every command. In a normal terminal I'd be able skim my `history` with the arrow keys so that I didn't have to keep retyping the same phrase over and over. This would be as simple as storing everything a user enters in an array and spitting it out when the arrow keys are hit.
 * I can't copy and paste. I can understand removing selection from a good chunk of the screen to keep things pretty, but I should be able to copy and paste from the input line.
 * There's no `completion`, so I actually have to type out commands and script names. Tab completion is a must in a terminal. Doing it in the browser could be a little weird. [This](http://jake0oo0.github.io/tab-complete/) looks good, as does [this](https://github.com/softprops/tabcomplete), and [this](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tab-complete) is on NPM but seems like a lot of work.
* A stored [RegExp](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp) is faster than [String.prototype.indexOf()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/indexOf) (although, to be clear, we're talking pretty miniscule differences here). More importantly, it's a more ""proper"" tool for the job. regex is the universal language of pattern-matching and string parsing. To put this in context, check out the source for [`skidinc.console.checkStr`](https://github.com/TotomInc/skid-inc/blob/master/js/console.js#L59), and then take a look at [these tests](https://jsperf.com/regexp-test-vs-looping-indexof) (Edit: YMMV, [these results](http://imgur.com/a/bzZ9T) aren't what I got initially). At first glance, it seems like `indexOf` might be better at rejecting bad commands, but it's not. It's only better at rejecting bad commands if the user optimally entered the first character in the search array (that little insight took me more than half an hour to realize, during which time I completely questioned everything I knew about JavaScript and regex). Because you're iterating over an array, a good command has to wait for all that processing.

    So what exactly did I do? First, I reviewed syntax [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/) because no one has regex memorized. Next, I approached the problem from two directions: what's acceptable and what's not acceptable.

        var notAcceptedRegExp = /[&lt;&gt;\(\)\[\],;\\\/'""]/;
    Here I've set up my regex using the literal syntax `/.../`. I'm searching for specific characters, so I enclose the characters in `[...]`. I have to escape most of them because we're working with special characters. Then you just use [`RegExp.prototype.test`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test).

        notAcceptedRegExp.test(""good command"") // false (we didn't find anything)
        notAcceptedRegExp.test(""bad ' command"") // true (we found one of the characters)

    From the other direction,

        var acceptedRegExp = /^[\w\- ]+$/;
    If we're attempting to exclude something, we might as well try to match only what's accepted. Again, literal, `/.../`. Now because I'm forcing this pattern on the entire string, I explicitly state this pattern has to start at the beginning, `^` (as opposed to before, when we didn't care where it was). I then say I'm looking for specific characters, `[...]`. `\w` is [shorthand for `[A-Za-z0-9_]`](http://www.regular-expressions.info/shorthand.html) (word characters). `\-` escapes the minus (e.g. `-l`), and ` ` adds space. Next, I say this pattern should be [repeated one or more times](http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html) using `+`. Because the next character is `$`, the end of the string, I'm saying that the entire string has to match this pattern (word character, `-`, and ` `). Throw `.test` on the end, and it should work.

        acceptedRegExp.test(""good command""); // true (it matched the pattern)
        acceptRegExp.test(""bad ' command""); // false (it had a bad character)

    You're definitely not wrong looping over an array. It's a common approach and easy to figure out. Plus regex can be pretty dense. I'm not trying to attack you or your code, or say that my way is the right way. I point it out because I like your code, and I think you could do some even cooler stuff with new tools.

**TL;DR:** regex isn't scary and lazy typers need their shortcuts. Design is rad.

**Edit for clarity:** Most of the time, `String.prototype.indexOf` is the right choice. If you need to match patterns, or find multiple things, or do anything more than check the index of a single substring once, it's usually better to use regex. If you can, always [pick the right tool for the job](http://wiki.c2.com/?PickTheRightToolForTheJob), but [make sure you understand the job first](http://wiki.c2.com/?FallacyOfTheRightTool).",1493597251
"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","The deaths in Rogue One felt like watching Serenity without seeing Firefly. They were so emphasised and dramatic that I felt like I should care about the characters a lot more than I did.

That, I think, is where the real problem of Rogue One. It spent so much time in the first half trying to flesh out this over-complicated plot that it didn't have time to give us a genuine human moment with the characters. Hell, I'm not even sure why half of them were there in the third act. Nobody seemed to want to; they just ended up there.

Yeah this subreddit is, isn't it? 


**DID ANYONE ON THIS SUB EVEN READ THE FUCKING ARTICLE POSTED??**

This is probably the lowest level fucking 'news' site I've ever heard.

There's literally no new information here. They're parroting what *everyone already know* slapping on a bull shit conclusion that somehow Pence knew about it and then lied (maybe he did maybe he didn't maybe the article should do some actual investigation and prove it) and then posted it here.

If this is true did the NYT cover it? WSJ? CNN? And if they did then..why is this here again because I assume those articles were already posted. Hell as far as I can tell they disprove their ""rock solid"" point that this is true in the very article by saying that it was done 'casually'. With the fucking incompetence of the Trump administration he could nominate Vladmir Putin himself accidentally and not realize he's the leader of a foreign country. But no there's rock solid evidence in this article from this random website, that provides no *new* sources of information,  that Pence totally lied and isn't just incompetent. 

This is *literally* just an opinion peace from a left-wing version of breitbart being held up as fact *BY PEOPLE NOT EVEN READING THE FUCKING ARTICLE*.

The problem is that you seem to take Egwene's beliefs about herself as true, when her actions are often at odds with them. You see it most when she thinks about the Emond's Fielders, but also with Aviendha and Elayne. Every single one of these characters has earned their abilities and demonstrated exceptional character, yet Egwene is frequently dismissive of them. Elaine has been trained her entire life to be a leader, yet Egwene frequently thinks her opinions on the matter are silly or unfounded. She frequently dismisses all of the women and their attitudes towards their SOs and even their taste in men, yet she's the only one who makes a bad match. She's the only one who acts like a silly lovestruck girl. She consistently underestimates Rand and is the only one who can never accurately predict his actions. She goes on and on about how no one knows him like her, but the events prove the opposite.

"Browns","t5_2s1wh","They definitely did not have a deep threat receiver after Fuller left. Yes, St.Brown was very good but he did not get the same attention as Fuller from opposing defenses. The offensive roster from 2015 from 2016 lost 5 guys to the NFL plus a 4 year starter at slot. With that turnover Kizer ended up with all new first time starters at receiver and some non existent TEs. Having watched every ND game since I can remember I can tell you that Kizer gets into his own head with trying so hard to keep his team in games with how bad that defense was that he locks into trying to hit that 1 play touchdown. When he's right and seeing the field he's unstoppable.  His ability to read defenses, check in and out of different plays and adjusting protections were actually pretty good IMO. Sure he did some stupid shit but that team wouldnt have been in any games without him. Everybody rags on them for going 4-8 BUT every loss up until the shit show at USC was by 8 points or less and they had the lead in the beginning of the 4th quarter in 5 of the 7. Few plays in each games and they 9 to 10 wins and hes a top 10 pick.There's no denying that he needed to be humbled a little but and I think this whole draft process did it.

He talks about how a drummer thinks and teaches a couple of patterns. Focus on up beats to push the music forward.

As a harmonic instrumentalist though, you should also be aware of your voice leading. Make sure the top note of your chord connects the chords smoothly as you comp. 

You can also experiment anticipating the next chord. First play the anticipated chord on the and of four. Then four, then and of three, then three. You'll see playing the anticipated chord shouldn't go past and of three. ",1493597253

Sobriety becomes a distant memory, whatever issues you have going on fade into the distance and you just live in the moment. That moment of course, is a wobbly faded disoriented universe. But, at first this feeling is scary. Over time you fall in love with that feeling and chase it. 

Now the scary part is, with other classes of drugs (stims, opiates etc.) you can chase that first feeling and probably never get to it. However, dissociatives you nearly always achieve that feeling and its sustainable. When I say sustainable, you don't perceive those negative side effects. 

You feel as though you're making good choices and that whilst 'not high' you're sober, but I've found you're never truly sober. Whilst using, the afterglow has a profound effect on your thought process, and this really isn't always a good thing. In fact it can be bad.

I'm not associated with this group in any way, I don't even share most of their views. The super important thing that people have to realize when comparing them to any other ""fascist-like"" groups from Europe is that the Polish version of it is deeply connected to Catholicism. http://prawy.pl/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/onrmszabialystok-300x225.jpg This is very important, because it means that they are ideologically limited by the religion. Nazis were pagan, they were destroying Christian morality and developing their own. This movement however does not try to develop their own morality - it is safely protected by Catholicism from degenerating into some neonazi shit, so I feel pretty safe about them, and would never compare them to some western real neo-nazi groups. Poland cannot have real neo-nazis, it's impossible here for obvious historical reasons, and people outside of Poland should be aware of that, and be careful with drawing parallels to western ""fascist-like"" groups.

In general your RAM is below standard, college recommends DDR4 and higher clock speeds (RAM). Non-dedicated graphics should be fine according to the standard. However, when software runs out of VRAM on the HD graphics card it begins to sap RAM, hurting speeds. I would recommend an upgrade IF you have the money. It's a close call and ultimately up to your judgement. I7 should be fine though.

Could be fussy, my computer had troubles AND CAD systems are a bitch. However, if don't have the money, campus services and COE labs have computers to run stuff.

Tl;dr: Would suggest an upgrade for modern ram. Follow the website advice!

"cycling","t5_2qhyi","I realize I didn't answer your main question bibs/jerseys...

I have worn several different brands of clothing: Hincapie, Primal, Pactimo, &amp; Castelli.

Hincapie clothing I feel is built for larger people because George is a big guy and that is who they designed their clothing after. By this I mean the jerseys are larger than most others as well as the bibs. On the downside their chamois don't last more than a season of solid use.

Primal is the smallest stuff I have worn. It fit very well once I was lean.

Pactimo had great chamois and overall fit.

I currently ride Castelli and I have to say they have the best chamois so far with Pactimo in a close second. Their jerseys are a little larger in the stomach than Pactimo.

This is also the first season I have started to use chamois cream. I have fought through the saddle sores for far too long. Going from rest week to rest week hoping they would heal enough for me to make it through the next racing block. I started using DZNuts Chamois Cream. David Zabriske is the owner/sponsor of this formula.

Hope that helps a little more.",1493597258

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","EDIT TO CLARIFY: I am mostly asking about how to formulate a strategy so that I am equipped to enter the system again despite my fear and previous bad experiences. I know I need therapy. 'Go to therapy' is not helpful advice.

I think we are talking past each other. I appreciate your time and your help. I know I'm being frustrating - I'm just really distressed, and yeah, most likely not being rational. I'll try to make myself clear, and I will bold the important stuff and stuff I didn't include before.

I have some problems. My problems are life-long, and complex. I don't care if they turn out to be ADHD or not. I agree that psychological support would be a good idea. I want that support. 

The problems are not down to depression or GAD: I've been screened for those, I've been depressed before and know what it's like, some family members have GAD but I know for sure that I do not. Some parts of my situation are making me anxious, and I self-medicate for that.

I tried therapy with a student clinic, but that was unhelpful - the support I received was in the form of organisational strategies that didn't work. **At the end of my treatment, the student psychologist recommended that I find an ADHD-specialist psychologist.** He reasoned that regardless of the cause of my problems, ADHD-friendly strategies are likely to help me. 

I need a subsidy to afford such a specialist. Accessing such subsidies means getting a mental health care plan from a GP. I found a clinic that appealed to me, and went to a GP to ask for a mental health care plan and a referral to that clinic. **I was acting on the advice of my psychologist at the time.** I got a whole bunch of blood tests (all normal), and was referred to a no-cost psychiatrist instead.

The psychiatrist was dismissive until I mentioned that I am not interested in stimulant medication, I would like a referral to the clinic of my choice. He took more notes in the last five minutes of the assessment than in the previous hour. He sent me off with a request for a urine test, and no psychologist referral.

I knew I'd fail that test, and because the psychiatrist was so hostile I thought that he would dismiss me as a drug-seeker. I didn't want to experience more distrust and hostility, and I bailed.
 
**A big part of why I bailed is that I am afraid of amphetamine stimulants.** The fact that the doctor requested a urine test made me afraid that I would get a script and no psych support. I know that stimulants help a lot of people. But three (!) of my colleagues received adult ADHD diagnoses, all three took stimulants (Dexedrine and Ritalin), and all had severe issues (psychosis, steep decline in previous conditions, etc). I was worried that I would be prescribed a high-risk substance that I might not even need instead of adequate assessment. 

**The present problem** 
 I need support, but I want *the right support*.** I need to figure out a strategy for approaching therapists so that I am assessed appropriately and taken seriously. I don't want to get a diagnosis if it is not appropriate. **

The advice of my old psychologist was that I find an ADHD specialist, but the barrier to that is cost. The cost can be reduced with a mental health care plan from a GP, but that went badly in the past. 

I'd like to try again, but cost, and my capacity to deal with the system are real limits. I already approached therapy without considering ADHD as a possibility, and it came up. Going through all of that again is a dreadful prospect. I just want an assessment so that it's ruled out as a possibility if I don't have it. 

&gt;again look for that suppport not the ADHD diagnosis

As you can see, I want support but I am scared that I will be dicked around again if I try. The possibility of ADHD and my desire for assessment came out of the therapy I initially received. I just thought I had cognitive issues of some sort. ",1493597260

If that's his only line of credit, closing it will take away from the age of his credit history and may make it more difficult for him to open another account on his own.  

I would have him check to see what companies might pre-approve him for a credit card, submit an application with one of them, and get approved.  There are some links you can check [here](http://www.magnifymoney.com/blog/building-credit/minimize-risk-check-if-youre-pre-qualified-for-a-credit-card220647375).  Once he has his new card in hand, close the joint account you have.  Then, if you have an older credit card with a low or no balance, add him as an authorized user (assuming you trust him enough).  You don't even have to give him the extra card to use; you can chop it up if you want.  But then your line of credit would appear on his report and help his score, as would the age of that credit.  It's different than cosigning, since the account is still solely yours, and you can remove him at any time without closing the account.

You didn't.  I asked why you think Tomlinson can succeed, you bring up Hankins and Odell.  I'm not asking you to evaluate scouts, i'm asking you to evaluate a player.  

&gt;I don't see why I need to say anything other than the scouts know more than you do, are you saying they don't?  

I mean, we ended up with Flowers at LT.  They're human just like anyone else.  There's a reason we don't have a single player from our 3rd or 4th round picks earlier than 2016 still on the roster.  I don't even know if any of them are in the NFL. Again:

Glaz is towards the bottom on there.

Then there is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPLzWqRc7u0

Then there is the fact that they have mostly fixed the in game damage stats. In game it says 152 damage. Each armor class reduces damage ~10%. 80% of 152 is 121.6 meaning it definitely downs and probably kills 3 armors close range without rook armor. Now rook armor makes things do ~15% less to 1 armors meaning it definitely still kills, ~17% less to 2 armors which means it does 152x.9x.83=113 so it 1 shot downs them, and for 3 armors it does 20% less meaning it does 152x.8x.8= 97 so they will be left with around 3 health. All of that is only under 5m, but he still 1 shots anything except a rook armored 3 armor under 5m which is close range.

"Insurance","t5_2qs6s","Diminished value is extremely difficult to prove. You have to prove the value of the specific vehicle just before the accident and the value just after the accident. And you have to technically incur the loss to have diminished value (i.e. in selling the vehicle).  I have worked property damage claims in 15 states (not California) and the only time I paid diminished value was to get a release for my insured. And it was never close to 10%.

You might ask why it is difficult to prove? You have three types of diminished value - immediate diminished value (which is the true loss of value as a result of the accident), inherent diminished value (which is the stigma of seeing a wreck on the carfax - even if there is no true immediate or repair-related diminished value) and repair related diminished value (which is where the repairs were not done properly to bring the car to a pre-loss state).  The idea is that a properly repaired vehicle will have no diminished value as the repairs bring the vehicle back to a pre-loss condition - and most proper repairs do.  This leaves the inherent diminished value as where the amount of a successful diminished value claim lies. If your vehicle was the only one on the lot and I really wanted the vehicle, I might pay the full blue book value of the vehicle. Now, if your vehicle is next to a vehicle in the exact same vehicle which hasn't been in an accident I would buy the other vehicle at blue book value or negotiate a discount to buy yours.

The real crux is there is little to no case law (outside Georgia) to establish a value and even in Georgia there is quite a disagreement over the value.  Truth is, you are likely to get a settlement only to avoid case law.

A good place to look for a good write up is at: [Matthiesen, Wickert &amp; Lehrer, S.C.] (https://www.mwl-law.com/a-primer-on-diminution-in-value-claims/).  They are one of the premier insurance subrogation attorneys in the nation.",1493597266

I know nothing about the gallery in question, but there certainly are galleries in Toronto that cater to tourists who don't really care about art but want to purchase a recognizable style.

To directly answer a couple of your questions, the above guide can help. I would also recommend ""The Practice of Network Security Monitoring"" by Richard Bejtlich, and ""Network Flow Analysis"" by Michael Lucas. Both are published by No Starch Press, which publishes a ton of fantastic books on security.

Regarding an entry level SOC analyst? Sure! Plenty of companies manage SOCs that have a good setup for entry level employees with opportunities to learn and move up within, or to other security teams. If you happen to live in Texas, a number of large banks and other firms have SOCs or other security shops setup here. I would also recommend working in space as a L1 sys admin or network analyst, anything in the infrastructure operation space can only help you be better at security. ",1493597271

"eGPU","t5_2ukno","Hey there,

I was in a similar situation but with a Dell E5440. I was able to get the eGPU to output to the internal monitor by using the 375.65 driver version on Windows 7/10 AND under Linux with Nvidia's proprietary driver version 375.39.

In my (2 day) experience, Linux was actually more performant and stable than Windows.

My initial plan was to use the eGPU outputting only to the internal display but I have since then given up on it.
After some testing I noticed that the fps I got when using an external display were roughly twice as many as when I was using the laptop's internal display. Besides, when testing the eGPU with the internal display I noticed that the mouse cursor would lag behind the movements I was making with the mouse, making it less than ideal to play or even work on.

Best of luck.",1493597273

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Part 2. Bralette reviews. Should have mentioned that I'm a 32C and would describe myself pretty much the way you did. My boobs must like to live kind of high on my torso, since I find myself thinking that bra straps are too long a lot of the time. If you don't have that issue you should disregard my criticisms based on that!  

1. Free People Galloon Lace Racerback, $20 ([link](https://www.freepeople.com/shop/galloon-lace-racerback-41333865/)). Came highly recommended, but I didn't love it. I thought the straps were too long and the bra made me look kinda flat and droopy. 

2. Tobi Lizze lace bralette, $13 ([link](http://www.tobi.com/product/65188-tobi-lizze-lace-bralette?encoded_id=9d6c396cf949898d106eb888f63841685e088252&amp;utm_campaign=order_order&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=transactional&amp;color_id=93937)). I think this may be a rebranded FP Galloon? Felt pretty much identical.

2. Aerie padded romantic lace bralette, $25 ([link](https://www.ae.com/bras-aerie-padded-romantic-lace-bralette-nude/aerie/s-prod/4447_2364_130?cm=sUS-cUSD&amp;catId=cat7530008)). Okay, I didn't actually buy this one. I really want to, but they're out of smalls in every color that I would consider. :( I mention it only because it looks promising, and Aerie is always recommended around here.

3. Victoria's Secret high-neck keyhole sport bra, $24.50 (I did the two-for-$25 deal, of course!) ([link](https://www.victoriassecret.com/vs-sport/all-sport-bras/high-neck-keyhole-sport-bra-victoria-sport?ProductID=320370&amp;CatalogueType=OLS)). This one is decently supportive, but the high neck makes me feel a bit like I'm getting strangled. Bear in mind that I may be a weirdo; I also dislike turtlenecks for the same reason.

4. Victoria's Secret strappy seamless sport bra, paid $14.99 but that must have been clearance and they're gone. :( This one is actually my favorite; maybe look for medium-support sports bras on VS that you like and you'll have similar luck? 

5. Hanes bandini bra, $10 for two on Amazon ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Hanes-Womens-Bandini-White-Medium/dp/B00EVLUXJ2/)). I'll wear these around the house, but I found the straps too long and the support pretty lacking. 

6. Queenie Ke light support cross back, $20 ([link](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06WWRW9FH/)). This is my second favorite behind \#4. I wish it weren't *quite* so padded, but I like the support. I got the pink, which is actually kind of a neon salmon.

That was the treasury notice

Here is a NYT article questioning Obama about the decision...

&gt;NYT: And then -- I’ll let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I don’t think you’ve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there’s been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow you’ve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that?

&gt;NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer?

Obama response doesn't say anything insightful. But... the law was very clear about when the mandate will be enacted. Obama, through executive action (although not signing an EO) delayed it. And it seemed to get pass major scrutinize because Republicans dislike the mandate anyway. 

But notice... the president doesn't have a one-line veto right (as dictated by the SCOTUS). Yet, Obama did a one-line veto and put in another date. But because the measure itself wasn't too controversial, the expansion of executive powers wasn't scrutinized.

That was the treasury notice

Here is a NYT article questioning Obama about the decision...

&gt;NYT: And then -- I’ll let Jackie go -- but on the employer mandate, I don’t think you’ve been asked the question directly why you made the decision to delay it, and whether, given your criticism of President Bush over the years for potentially exceeding his executive authority, there’s been a lot of folks out there on the Republican side who claim that somehow you’ve exceeded your authority on this. Is there anything to that?

&gt;NYT: People questioned your legal and constitutional authority to do that unilaterally -- to delay the employer mandate. Did you consult with your lawyer?

Obama response doesn't say anything insightful. But... the law was very clear about when the mandate will be enacted. Obama, through executive action (although not signing an EO) delayed it. And it seemed to get pass major scrutinize because Republicans dislike the mandate anyway.

The series will be a machinima, probably animated using Skyrims engine (Using better textures and lighting than vanilla) which will loosely be based off of Arena's story, but presenting it as it should be in the lore without gameplay limitations the games suffer from. So that means huge cities with lots of citizens vs. small villages with twenty houses we see in-game. Potential storylines include:

**Imperial Simulacrum** Jagar Tharn overthrows the Emperor and takes his place with the help Mehrunes Dagon and some of his cultists. The EC escapes and goes all over Tamriel to bring him down, learning all about the world of Nirn, acting as a proxy for the audience.

**Battlespire** Mehrunes Dagon invades the Imperial Battlespire as payment for helping Tharn, and two battlemages get caught up in the invasion and eventually defeat Dagon himself.

**Barenziah** Barenziah plays an incredibly important part of how Jagar overthrew Emperor, but also how he was brought down. Her story is very interesting and ripe for adaptation.

**Tiber Septim Flashback** Flashbacks to Tiber Septim and how he forged the Empire. Considering Barenziah is involved in his story as well, this gives us a great segue to this flashbacks. We could see how he forged his alliance with some of the last remaining Dragons, one of which are actually in the Battlespire.

It makes her worthless in my eyes. It's so sad to see. Pearls before swine.

I understand that pedestalizing women is no road to success. I've had plenty of ""success"" if that's what you want to call mashing genitals with a strange woman. It's just that we need to stop pretending to be r selected animals, hooking up with strangers, treating women like dogs, etc. As long as our society is infiltrated by propagandist Jews and mouth breathing animals, we have no choice but to play the same game... 

Which means smart people who wear condoms and abort unwanted kids are not breeding, but dumb careless animals with no sense of responsibility do breed.

White men are aware that the prettiest of their girls throw themselves at a less than average tyrone simply because he's black. If beastiality was a popular trend then do you think women would care the quality of the animal? Of course not, in fact it might be more edgy if the animal was especially ugly.

They're testing us. They're pushing our limits. What are we doing to do about it?

I work in an office building where I need to scan a card to get to my area. If tomorrow they've taken away the need to scan my card I'll have the same access but on different terms. 

&gt;(it's not the same as a non-tariff trade barrier, which might involve common regulations)

You need to be careful about labelling and such, look at the garlic smuggling (yes, garlic smuggling) that goes on through Norway into Sweden.

The meeting was cancelled because it wasnt seen likely [being productive](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/05/philippines-president-rodrigo-duterte-barack-obama-son-whore) given the insults and decided to meet with the S. Korea cult puppet president instead.

On the surface Trump's meeting isnt significantly different. Meet with a hostile and dangerous leader of what should be an allied nation.

It was the moment of truth, I thought to myself, fingering through the black leather for my drivers license. This ID had cost me a handsome Benjamin, but that was nothing compared to the price of Legos on the streets. They costed a solid grand for a set that a child could get for a hundred dollars, and that's totally excluding any sets to do with Star War. 

""O-oh, u-umm..."" I stammered  before my fingers finally closed around the license. This had better work. ""H-here."" I gave him an uneasy smile as I held the card out towards him. The grocery clerk, who was named Jeffrey by his tag, gave me a suspicious glance and carefully took the card.

""I should inform that we have a new security measure in place,"" Jeffrey said, eyeballing the card in his hand, ""I'm just going to give this a quick scan. You should understand - it's not every day you see an 8th grader with stubble.""

My eyes instantly widened. Internally I was spewing expletives. I should have shaved better, used a sharper razor, something! I knew the jig was up. Before Jeffrey even got a chance to scan the card, I bolted for the sliding doors the led out of Target, forgetting the Legos and the fraudulent identification alike. 

However, my escape was not to be. In a few moments that felt to be an hour, an alarm began to blare and red beacons flashed above the door. I was so close, but as soon as I got in range of the exit door-sensor, thick metallic bars slid up from the ground, blocking my escape. I hit the door with my moment, letting out a surprised cry. 

""Freeze! Hands up!"" sounded a voice from behind me. I slowly turned my gaze around, kneeling on the ground after the impact. It was Jeffrey, except he had a taser pointed directly at me, and you could see the red polo he was wearing discarded behind him, replaced by a navy button up with a badge displayed on his chest. 

""I forgot retails had skeleton crews..."" I cursed under my breath...

""Don't make me ask again!"" Jeffrey shouted.

""Okay, okay!"" I yelled back, standing to my feet and putting my hands behind my head.

""You are hereby under arrest for the attempted acquisition of products beyond your age group!"" He shouted, hastily moving towards me, pulling out his handcuffs.

The minutes flew by, and before I knew it, I was in the back of a police cruiser, another man sat next to me. He was heavily tattooed, bald, and muscular enough to challenge a comic book superhero.

""What are you in for?"" He asked in a gruff voice, glancing at me.

""I... I tried to buy legos,"" I said, intimidated, ""You?""

You make some great points. My argument about the basic life requirement fact is not so much that it's about the money, but more that you're talking about behaviors that *all* people do.

More than 20% of people are eligible organ donors.

Point is, you're *expected* to take care of yourself. That's called being human. That's what keeps you alive. You have every right not to. But that doesn't mean that you've earned your organs in some way.

I personally would like to know why this spirit contacted me and showed it's probable sigil. Try to meditate like you did before, be aware of your dreams and wait to see if the entity will manifest itself again to you. If it won't, you could evoke it and use whatever method to communicate, like a pendulum or a Ouija board. Remember to be friendly, but also cautious. Carry any item that you know will protect you and ensure that you are in control. Ask it whatever you want and draw your own conclusions about the nature of this entity. It could even be a spirit willing to guide you or something, like your ""guardian angel"". In this case, evoking it to make a pact could be beneficial.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt; If he's so dumb why can't we just invade NK and take him out with no civilian casualties.

This is the part you don't understand. No one wants to deal with millions of uneducated, illiterate, brainwashed refugees. The US could probably take him out without many casualties. Kim doesn't control every aspect of the military at all times. If there is an attack on the country, they will strike back with their border defenses. Did you think kim invented all of that technology? 

&gt;If he's so dumb how has he continued to play the world for care packages and gifts while he commits atrocious acts on his people.

Even an idiot can put pieces together and realize that his father did the exact same thing and no one ever did anything about it because of China. No country has anything to gain by attacking North Korea either. Do you think any government actually cares about citizens in basically a 3rd world country? The US is known as the world police, but only when it really benefits them or if they can see no consequences. The consequences from attacking NK would have been huge in the last 10 years once again, due to China.

&gt;If he's dumb then why doesn't a military leader just overthrow him and assume the leader role?

His military leaders probably live great lives and will expect to be assassinated after killing a ""god"", what do they have to gain? Kim has the support of his entire country due to his father's/grandfather's genius. A military leader who kills him will not have that same kind of support.

You still keep dodging the fact that he is basically being cut off from China, his only support, after ignoring their warnings for the last few months. He isn't too bright, get over it. How about you explain this before we continue? What is the genius behind getting cut off from your only real support?",1493597281

Too many people are absolutely clueless when it comes to staying safe in a natural environment.

The summer I took my family to the the Grand Canyon, I read ""Death in the Grand Canyon"".  Most of the deaths are due to people just not understanding how dangerous the environment is.  It's not that it's hard to follow the few simple rules you must follow to be safe.  It's that people don't believe that not following those rules can get them killed.

A couple of years ago there was a story out of central Texas about a family who died when the vacation house they were staying in was washed away in a flash flood.  Even though the husband had grown up in that area and even though they had moved their cars to higher ground, they did not fully understand the danger they were in.

While they did fail to give the troops proper winter attire, the main reason the Germans got fucked was due to their stretched supply lines and the fact that the Soviet military had reorganized and was actually much more competent then commonly show in the media.

The ""deadly winter"" thing was largely a concoction of German propaganda that was used to justify why they didn't plow through the supposedly inferior Slavs. After all, the Nazis were convinced that they were naturally superior, so it couldn't have possibly been the skill and tenacity of the Soviet troops that caused their offensive to fail, right? So instead they blamed it all on the weather.

This stuck in the post-war West as the traditional explanation largely because of our feud with the Soviets. We didn't want to make them look good during the Cold War, so we ended up adopting this largely untrue idea that it was primarily winter that defeated the Germans.",1493597283

Scientists focus on natural law - discovering new information.

Engineers use said information to use it to address real world problems.


Engineers and scientists can mingle in each other's fields but that's the general idea.

Being an engineer doesn't make you a scientist.


Source: work in reliability engineering.

Edit: and applied scientists could be any technician. We use science for our jobs. The only thing an engineer could do that would be related to being a scientist is research. However, it would be to improve their own engineering discipline, not for the science world, but that would make him scientist- so if you develop robots or bionic arms you discover new bs so you could be labeled a scientist.

I disagree with /u/kakap0123, the real thrill was finding a bolt or ak at a rad town and running back to base to research it, gambling an AK now just feels shitty and a waste when other weapons are nearly as good without having to use rifle bodies.

&gt;Every wipe is different depending on what components you've been able to find.

It's different for maybe the first hours, on whether or not you get an early semi auto body or not, even if you only loot the small harbor you still get multiple rifle bodies pretty easily.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I am not trying to push blame or say it isn't Trump's responsibility. I am alluding to the fact that maybe Flynn is a really good liar and bamboozled everyone even the all powerful FBI, DoJ, and DoD.
I don't believe this leads any real credibility to the Russian collusion accusation. The RT work was done in 2015 before he was apart of the Trump campaign.  And there are no other ties.  
To me Flynn is illegal of what most powerful people fall prey to, they think the rules don't apply to them.  
I think trying to link all of this to the allegations of Russian collusion is stretching it beyond what is allowable.

"pebble","t5_2txls","I'll post this again as it's relevant:

&gt;The OG Pebble has a 130mAh battery, which is roughly 0.5 watt hours. The Pebble Display is a Sharp Memory LCD with a 25µW Static draw, and 35µW Dynamic draw (never updating the screen vs once a second). If your battery life is 10 days, the display is responsible for 0.0084 watts, or 1.68% of the battery usage if it's refreshed once a second, and 1.2% if the image is static.

&gt;This means if the battery was only powering the display and nothing else, you would get a 595 days of battery life, which you could up to 833 days by never updating the image.

&gt;The biggest power draw is bluetooth by a large margin, followed far, far behind by waking the CPU to issue a redraw for the screen when the time changes.

---

&gt;A proper eink, like on a Kindle, uses no power to keep a static image but uses quite a lot when changing it. The memory LCD of a pebble uses practically the same amount regardless of what it shows or how often it's updated, so it's all about what does the updating.

&gt;Walking up the CPU once a second to render a new screen uses a lot of power, and 60 times as much as once a minute, but it doesn't matter what is shown on the screen. So the all black NightFace is barely any better than any other basic (no weather, health, seconds etc) watchface. If you have motion activation on, you'll wake it up quite often anyway.",1493597291

Since your SCV survived I would have looked for the Stargate and might have accidentally found the hidden base, but you randomly scouted it anyway.

Right off the bat I would have saved my Factory after the scout. Stargate tech means no detection, or at least only Oracles for detection. Mines could be pretty helpful on defense. After that your priority should have been Vikings and then Stim for Marines. If you started two Vikings right after your first two Medivacs finished then you would have had them for your first move out.

First move out went poorly because you did a move command instead of attack move and lost a cyclone for free. You didn't micro your other cyclone to lock on to a void, and you didn't stutter step your marines to get under the void rays or focus fire to kill one. If you do any of those things or have vikings for support then you likely kill a void and he never gets a critical mass of units.

You need to defend your base while killing his gold base, so Vikings are essential. You should have just taken the time to kill the rocks to get to the gold so you stay close to your base. With rocks down, a huge ground army vs none and four vikings you crush his air and his base easily.

I have since returned my plates and have a receipt that I surrendered my plates and it's on my DMV abstract that I surrender my plates (the supervisor at the DMV showed me his computer screen) but to this day I still get toll evasion notices and fines I get to try and defend myself again - it's easy, but also a pain in the ass.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt;Community colleges don't get you nearly as many jobs.

You understand this is a path out of poverty and not, you know, a path to the upper class, right?

Community colleges don't get you as many jobs as an ivy league or state school. Does that change the fact that a community college degree is worth more than *no* degree? Didn't think so.

&gt;Because payday loans accept people with no credit and banks require reasonably good credit. If you're in poverty, you are unlikely to have much credit.

Most people can qualify for bank loans if they have a credit rating in the upper 500s. If you don't, you'd still be good to just put the cost on a credit card(even at 22% interest yearly, it's still worth the investment). If you don't have that, then do side jobs until you've saved the staggering $200 needed for the course.

&gt;If you're in poverty and trying to get out, you're probably already taking those extra shifts and extra jobs when they're available.

&gt; Do I even have the option to choose where I want to stay?

They will send you the info eventually

&gt; is it harder to make friends if you don't have a roommate?

It is harder to make friends if you aren't living in the dorm residences (that is, REV and V1). However, you can make up for it and make friends, it's not difficult. But it does require some kind of effort, so if you want friends with little to no effort, the solo room might not be for you.

&gt; do you think I could fit a full-sized desktop PC in my room without making everything crammed?

Not an issue anywhere

Bottomline: If you can and want to cook, have your own solo room, and don't mind spending a bit of extra money, go MKV. If you really want the easy social life, no worries about cooking, meal plan for everything, but less privacy, V1.

Point is the military loves forward operating bases. They don't like to give them up just because whatever leader in the country is unsavory. We still have aircraft in turkey and Saudi Arabia for this reason. The Saudi royals are worse than dueterte imo. In case something bad happens with Iran we can launch from Saudi Arabia, not North Carolina. An airforce 4x as close is 4x as effective. When aircraft are so expensive that helps. 


The majority of bombs ready for the b52 are still considered dumb weapons. The b52 is kept active because it can drop so many pounds of ordinance. We don't use them at full lethality because we haven't fought a serious opponent in decades. The b52 is how we would de industrialize an enemy though. Aircraft carriers are indeed the most useful, but f22 don't launch from carriers. They need f22 for any invasion of china or Russia, because our stealth aircraft can't launch from carriers. The aircraft on carriers are only useful for countries where they don't have modern air defense. 

You don't think America keeps bases near china because it's the only other competition for superpower? Why do we insist they don't militarize the islands they are building air bases on? We claim they could use them to stop trade, as if somehow china would block trade routes they are dependent on. It's equally unthinkable that china would block trade as America invade. Yet we spend 600 billion on a military every year capable of just that. The military doesn't plan for things going well, they plan for crap hitting the fan.

The Think Tank bag is quite small but if you're organized it can fit a pile of stuff and most importantly be unobtrusive enough to not look out of place in a decent restaurant, bar, club, etc. (I'm not a fan of the ""backpacker uniform"" look, not at all.)

It carries a mirrorless camera, external camera flash, mini tripod, spare camera battery, external battery for smartphone, sunglasses, water bottle, umbrella, knife, flashlight, notepad/pen, toilet tissue/wet wipes and a few other odds and ends. I swapped out the shoulder strap for a slash-proof model and I've been very happy with it.

Adds Umami, body, and dimension imho. Plays really well with all the other flavours. Plus cinnamon in chili is underused. That and proper Chipotle are Ace in my experience. Meat eaters even raved about it, so I will take that. ",1493597303

 [artist pic](https://lastfm-img2.akamaized.net/i/u/252/f9883c6738bd4497ad6fc4b63a3df76b.png)  

&gt; Ali Farka Touré (October 31, 1939 – March 7, 2006) was a Malian singer and multi-instrumentalist, and one of the African continent's most internationally renowned musicians. His music is widely regarded as representing a point of intersection of traditional Malian music and its North American cousin, the blues. The belief that the latter is historically derived from the former is reflected in Martin Scorsese's often quoted characterization of Touré's tradition as constituting ""the DNA of the blues"". 

&gt; Ali Ibrahim ""Farka"" Touré was born in 1939 in the village of Kanau, on the banks of the Niger River in Gourma-Rharous Cercle in the northwestern Malian region of Tombouctou. His family moved to the nearby village of Niafunké when he was still an infant. He was the tenth son of his mother but the only one to survive past infancy. ""The name I was given was Ali Ibrahim, but it's a custom in Africa to give a child a strange nickname if you have had other children who have died"", Touré was quoted as saying in a biography on his Record Label, World Circuit Records. His nickname, ""Farka"", chosen by his parents, means ""donkey"", an animal admired for its tenacity and stubbornness: ""Let me make one thing clear. I'm the donkey that nobody climbs on!"" Ethnically, he was part Songrai, part Fula.

&gt; As the first African bluesman to achieve widespread popularity on his home continent, Touré was often known as ""the African John Lee Hooker"". Musically, the many superpositions of guitars and rhythms in his music were similar to John Lee Hooker's hypnotic blues style. He usually sang in one of several African languages, mostly Songhay, Fulfulde, Tamasheq or Bambara as on his breakthrough album, Ali Farka Touré, which established his reputation in the world music community.

&gt; His first North American concert was in Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia. 1994's Talking Timbuktu, a collaboration with Ry Cooder, sold promisingly well in Western markets, but was followed by a hiatus from releases in America and Europe. He reappeared in 1999 with the release of Niafunké, a more traditional album focusing on African rhythms and beats. Touré was the mentor and uncle of popular Malian musician Afel Bocoum.

&gt; Some of Ali Farka Touré's songs and tunes have been used in different programmes, films and documentaries. For instance, his guitar riff on the song ""Diaraby"", from the album Talking Timbuktu, was selected for the Geo-quiz segment of The World PRI-BBC program, and was retained by popular demand when put to a vote of the listeners. This song is likewise used in 1998 as a soundtrack for the film L'Assedio (Besieged) by the Italian director Bernardo Bertolucci. His songs Cinquante six, Goye Kur and Hawa Dolo from the album The Source are also used as a soundtrack in the French film Fin août, début septembre (Late August, Early September) directed in 1998 by Olivier Assayas. The song ""Lasidan"" was featured in the award winning documentary ""Sharkwater"" by Rob Stewart.

&gt; In 2002 he appeared with Black American blues and reggae performer Corey Harris, on an album called Mississippi to Mali (Rounder Records). Toure and Harris also appeared together in Martin Scorsese's 2003 documentary film Feel Like Going Home, which traced the roots of blues back to its genesis in West Africa. The film was narrated by Harris and features Ali's performances on guitar and njarka.

&gt; In 2004 Touré became mayor of Niafunké and spent his own money grading the roads, putting in sewer canals and fuelling a generator that provided the impoverished town with electricity.

&gt; In September 2005, he released the album In the Heart of the Moon, a collaboration with Toumani Diabaté, for which he received a second Grammy award. His last album, Savane, was posthumously released in July 2006. It was received with wide acclaim by professionals and fans alike and has been nominated for a Grammy Award in the category ""Best Contemporary World Music Album"". The panel of experts from the World Music Chart Europe (WMCE), a chart voted by the leading World Music specialists around Europe, chose Savane as their Album of the Year 2006, with the album topping the chart for three consecutive months (September to November 2006). The album has also been listed as No. 1 in the influential Metacritic's ""Best Albums of 2006"" poll, and No. 5 in its all-time best reviewed albums. Ali Farka Touré has also been nominated for the BBC Radio 3 awards 2007.
Touré was ranked number 76 on Rolling Stone's list of ""The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time""  and number 37 on Spin magazine's ""100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time"".
His record label, World Circuit, said that he recorded several tracks with his son, Vieux Farka Touré, for Vieux's debut album which was released in late 2006.

&gt; On March 7, 2006, the Ministry of Culture of Mali announced his death at age 66 in Bamako from bone cancer, against which he had been battling for some time.

&gt; Cultural references

&gt; In the French film The Spanish Apartment (2002), two characters are seen playing air guitar to ""Ai Du"".
In the movie Unfaithful (2002), Diane Lane and Olivier Martinez slow dance to ""Ai Du"".
In the French film Irma Vep (1996), Maggie Cheung and Nathalie Richard ride an old motorcycle down the quay to Touré's song ""Soukoura"".
In the 2005 travel film Michael Palin: SAHARA, his music is heard in a scene about Nigerian nomads.
The World, a radio show distributed by Public Radio International, uses the song ""Diaraby"" as the theme to their Geoquiz. The song is a collaboration between Touré and Ry Cooder; the song is featured on their Talking Timbuktu album.

For example, bear game: 

Me: ""if I'm a bear,  and Jeremy is a bear... is Diego a bear?""

New person: ""uhhhh I don't know""

Me: ""no. He's not a bear.""

        ""Ok, now listen. If I'm a bear and Jeremy is a bear, is Diego a bear?""

New person: ""no""

Me: ""yes, he is. You need to listen.""

""If Jeremy is a bear and Diego is a bear, am I a bear?""

New person: ""uhhh no?""

Me: ""correct. Now, why?""

NP: ""fuck, I don't know.""

Me: ""ok, now listen... if Jeremy is a bear and Diego is a bear, am I a bear?""

NP: ""no""

What?

&gt;I think that porn companies try to appeal to guys more than gals because on average, guys are more turned on visually than gals.

This isn't an excuse.  This is openly thus stating that there's a bias in porn for men.  The patterns are misogynistic, but most people think to be so, or racist or sexist or whatever, one needs to be *openly* that way.  That's untrue, and that's the reason a lot of stuff goes unchallenged.

&gt;EDIT: As for racism in porn, it's interesting that in the gay section pornhub, searches for 'black' or 'BBC' tend to be highest in Southern states.

And in countries where homosexuality is illegal, searches are higher for that.  People like to dabble in taboo things.",1493597309

"fantasywriting","t5_2uch5","&gt; Tell me, were you more invested in the force when they started talking about midichlorian counts or when Obi Wan was telling Luke to let it flow through him? For the most part, magic can be nebulous.

Choosing an example from a shitty screenwriter isn't a good way to prove your point. 

&gt; Laymen in a fantasy world wouldn't know much about it except that it exists and practitioners don't usually bang on about the specifics. 

You're worldbuilding. That's not a universal assumption. 

&gt; I had a friend who was writing a fantasy novel and came up with a really cool magic system. Problem was, he got so caught up in it that he forgot that novels are mostly about conflict and drama.

Again, using shitty writers as an example is not a way to prove your point. 

&gt; In terms of resolving conflict, it's a good idea to let on what your magic can do but much like in Star Wars and any pulp fiction soft sci fi, it's not the mechanics that draw the readers in, it's the characters, the world and the structure.

You didn't actually read any of the Sanderson links did you?

If you did, you wouldn't be blathering on about ""mechanics drawing readers in"" which is the _exact opposite_ of the point Sanderson makes.

It was most of the hotel that had poor service but there actually were admittedly a few employees that I spoke to that were actually incredibly nice, especially during the night shift.

Long answer: That's a question fans have been asking since the movie came out. Some people think that it means eradicating the Jedi, others think that it means conquering the galaxy and still others think that it simply means pursuit of the dark side. There are some speculators out who think that Kylo might be something of a double agent and be referring to bringing balance to the force by destroying the dark side from within. As far as what Kylo knows and doesn't know...we don't know. We know for sure that Ben Solo didn't know that Darth Vader was his grandfather until about 6 years prior to The Force Awakens, so it's possible (maybe even likely) that Luke/Leia never told him about much of anything regarding Anakin's fall and eventual redemption. If Kylo does know about Vader's redemption and what he did to the Emperor, does this mean that he will try to kill Snoke? Who can say for sure...",1493597317

Your contact information can be condensed and on a single line. You don't need a full address, or an address at all actually. Your city, state is more than enough. Nice to see a LinkedIn! Too often on here I am asking people where that is!


You don't need to indicate that your job title is a job title, we get that. I also don't think the ""Level 2"" is needed as it won't mean anything to someone outside your company. If you were aiming for the same company then it would help them understand your place in the system, but you aren't so ""Junior Developer"" works just fine. Your date range has an odd slash between March and 2015 that should just be a space. There should also be space around the hyphen in your date range. The biggest problem though is you don't have bullet points underneath this job. You tell us nothing about what the job entails.


Think about your time in this position. What are you responsible for? What have you done in terms of larger projects and what results did they have? What do you feel like you accomplished in this position? There needs to be content here.


Why do you have an extra line after the heading for education that you don't have after the heading for work experience? Be consistent with your formatting. Experience and skills also don't have the space, so either make all the headings have a extra line of white space after them or not.


You don't need to list the awkward pipe (this | character) after your graduation date. You should be listing your degree first with the graduation date following it. Your GPA is not high enough to note, remove it.


I don't understand this ""Experience"" section nor the ""Related Educational Projects"" they both feel like they don't have any thought put in. List the specific project you worked on, your role on the project, and then have bullet points talking about the project, project goals, what software or programming languages it used, and what it accomplished. Focus in on just a few projects that you feel are most important, you don't want to push your resume onto a second page.


Your skills section is okay, but it should be higher on your resume. Are those the only languages you know? Do you know any frameworks or libraries? You can list those too. Do you have any technical certifications? Those might be something employers would pay for you to have, including even something like a certified Scrum Master as your career goes on. Don't underestimate certifications and I would do research into them and if any companies you work for going forward would be willing to help you earn them. Linux and Microsoft are operating systems not environments, so unsure why you labeled them as such. No Mac? Might be good to get going forward, but also you could stretch yourself into mobile platforms by picking up something like Android Studio or Swift down the line.",1493597318

You say what if they are innocent, thats a good argument. I never said how often, or to what degree we should enforce the death penalty, just we should keep it.

In 2011 I was on this solo road trip hosteling across the Southwestern US. I had lived in Houston my entire life and just needed some change. When I got to California I visited my cousin—a UCSB student at the time—and fell in love with Santa Barbara overnight. I left the next day for whatever reason and returned the following week after chatting with my cousin's friend who needed a roommate. We hit it off and Santa Barbara became my home for the next 3 years.

The only opinion that changed was that I couldn't stay in Santa Barbara and be successful. I decided I'd be better off in a big city where I'd have better career opportunities, so I ended up moving to the Bay Area in 2014.",1493597320
"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","The entire Federation isn't exactly morally bankrupt, but there are government agencies with... less than pleasant histories.

The **Office of Special Intelligence**, or **OSI**, acts in the public eye as a military intelligence agency that identifies and monitors potential threats to Hadean civilization. Behind closed doors, OSI maintains an extensive public surveillance network that monitors public discourse, influences popular perceptions, identifies dissidents -- and in some cases, silences them. OSI's mission, essentially, is to preserve the Federation at all costs.

The dirty work is carried out by the **Spec**ialized **T**actical **R**econnaissance and **E**spionage division, or **SPECTRE**. Officially, SPECTRE does not exist. Everyone who supposedly works for it are likewise officially dead, complete with official death records. Unofficially, these are known as **Shadows**, and through a combination of intense psychological, genetic, and chemical conditioning, as well as cybernetic augmentation, the Shadows are the finest warriors and spies ever fielded by the Hadean species.

There are never any witnesses to Shadow activities. Nobody is ever seen entering or leaving the area, and the only evidence they leave behind are craters and corpses. Federal records are altered and investigations tampered with to create official stories of accidents, criminal murder, or natural deaths.

SPECTRE was first activated on a large scale during and after the Corsair Wars, c. 2389-2404AC, where dissident factions calling themselves the United Free Colonies rebelled against the Federation, stealing colony ships and escaping to unclaimed space using terror attacks as a diversion. Once the main Federation military had put down the insurrection, OSI convinced the Central Authority to grant ""autonomy"" to the UFC, ostensibly as a social relief valve where citizens could willingly renounce their citizenship and permanently emigrate to UFC worlds. In practice, OSI used SPECTRE to kidnap, coerce, or otherwise relocate potential dissidents to the UFC, which was more or less used as a penal colony.

OSI and SPECTRE are not *all* bad, though -- the activities carried out by SPECTRE during the Extinction War -- particularly the operations DARK WATER, DEAD HAND, and PERSISTENT DOUBT -- were critical in securing the Hadean victory, sufficiently weakening the Val'Turri enough for StarForce to turn the tide and eventually defeat the alien menace.",1493597320

It seems like he's thinking about the idea more and more because the first roadblock when we started talking about everything was that I was because I was a man but that was about a month ago now. Now when he talks about us it's more about wanting to be single and not having to deal with the drama of being in a relationship (which I totally understand, it just sucks because I know if I can trust him, and I do to a certain degree, that won't be a problem). I think I'm emotionally mature when it comes to being in a relationship with someone and I don't want to be manipulative or crazy or evil or anything. I think there's already too much toxic in the world and I don't want to add to it. I just want to love him, support him, make him laugh, and experience the adventure that is life with him. If I were to go in an official relationship with him, I'd enter it with the mindset of: ""If you love something, let it go"". As in, I fucking love you man and I want to share this life with you, the good and the bad, but I don't need you, I need myself. I choose to be with you. This is something that I carry with all of my friendships and family members.

Yeah, I love your unbiased yet clear perspective. I don't feel emotionally anguished by him at all. That's why I feel that this is so right. I just feel like loving him isn't hard and he's just in a box that doesn't know where to go and here I am caressing him and supporting him along the way. It's not emotionally taxing on me. I just feel right. I'm excited to see when he comes out of this box because I know it's going to be absolutely magical.

If you were being suppressed, don't just stay still then. Move to a different position or engage targets that you can still hit while suppressed.

Fly better than the other pilot. If you're in an Attack plane or a bomber, unless you take a decent amount of damage, a ram from a Fighter shouldn't kill you.

"Paranormal","t5_2qjxn","I have a background in science and history.  There's a logical order to the world and universe. We understand the world on the subparticle level.  We understand how life is created. How it's structured.

We can trace religion back to the earliest known civilizations.  Religion is based in fear, superstition, and political control  In Sumerian the people believed the priests &amp; priestess interpreted the will of the gods.  That gave them not just political control, but control over the economy, including production and distribution of food.  

Understanding something about biology, geology, and human history makes it impossible for me to embrace the concept of God that is promoted by organized religions.  I've explored a number of religions from Catholicism to Unitarianism.  It's all about blind faith, accepting as a truth all things they promote as a truth, and the demand to question them not.  They are cults--they isolate themselves.  Non-believers are cast out.  Religions like Mormons and Jehovah Witness practice forms of shunning to keep their followers mentally isolated from non-believers. 

I always hesitate to say I'm spiritual because it's a very vague term.  Life is energy.  The human body produces electricity to power bodily functions from synapses to heartbeat.  I just can't comprehend how that cellular activity is able to move beyond the physical body after death. 

So that's why I have such a difficult time with this series of events...so much of it cannot be logically explained.",1493597325

Arguing with a rager in chat *is* contributing to the problem. Both people are a problem, both people deserve to be punished. There's no fair way to determine who ""started it"" and who should be punished more heavily. If you rage less, you'll be punished less. You're seriously suggesting that Riot employees scroll through chat logs of ragers, see who ""started it"" and then punish only that person and not the person raging back at him? Never going to happen.

And I don't understand what solution you're suggesting. Riot's system does discourage repeat offenders. You're going to get several bans lasting a few hours to a few months before you get perma banned. And getting perma banned is a *massive* blow to the player who could have put thousands of hours and hundreds of dollars into that account. What is your suggestion? You're saying they need to be punished, but if they get punished then they will make a new account? There's no way to solve the issue.

I've been playing the game consistently for over 7 years now and I have seen a visible change in the community since Riot took a strict approach to banning players. Ragers are far less common and more tame than back in the day. Clearly their approach works. ",1493597326

Evolutionary pressure, before modern formula feeds ""leaving a newborn under age 1-2 for more than 3-4 hours at a time"" was a good way to kill it pretty quick, unless you were a queen/noblewoman able to afford a wet nurse, and even then only in the post-agriculture era.

Is she required to give any kind of notice to the new tenants that the house is being foreclosed on by the HOA? I have also read that if the people that buy the house want to move in themselves they don't need to let the tenant live out their lease?

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","I'm glad you mentioned that, because I did see a doctor and then also sought a second opinion. 

Why?

Because I honestly thought I was cracking.

So I underwent a battery of tests with the first doctor and was given a clean bill of health.

I then got a second opinion and the results are the same.

Understand that my entire life, I have maybe 5 dreams I can recall. After this event in September, I started finding answers via these synchronicity events. An event would happen, it would spur a question in my mind, and then I'd think to myself ""Ok...so what if I then search for X in Wikileaks, CIA files, FOIA files, etc.""

Each time, without fail, I'd uncover information which constituted the building blocks. Once the base was built, it was then a matter of re-examining history to see if events with flimsy explanations as taught...or still lingering questions and doubts...could be viewed in a different light or answered through this theory.

....and that's when the floodgates opened.

I operate under the presumption that similarities of deiti S (good and evil) in ancient cultures are not coincidence and that to discount botbthese similiarities....and the staggering amount of admissions in the modern day by military and high ranking defense officials from nations around the world as they get up their in age...and the admissions of our own astronauts...cannot be discounted.

Do you really think we just had NASA stop manned space exploration due to budgetary issues when we give a blank check to DoD and CIA to be spent on MIC companies like Boeing and Northrop?

MIC, in conjunction with the USAF and USN, are the ones truly doing the development and exploration of space.

NASA in the modern day is a poorly funded puppet show and how people have not yet figured this out is beyond me.

Also, ever notice how any nation with the technological capability to send a man to the moon claims it will do so by X year, but then quietly scraps the plans to do so and never talks about it again?

Some nations are ""in the loop"" and others are not. Nations not in the loop are brought into it the second they announce their intent to put a man n the moon.

If we could do it in 1969 with CPU power akin to less than a TI-83 calculator, any damn country today with $ and engineers proficient can get a man onto the moon with modern technology.

Start finding logical inconsistencies.

Start trying to glean answers from that which you're not told.

A great way to do this and train your mind is, surprisingly, to retrain your brain into understanding and applying formal logical reasoning for critical analysis. LSAT materials are a great help.

"androiddev","t5_2r26y","Hi there, I’m the maintainer of the NDK. I wanted to take a moment to respond to some of these points and show that things are improving here.

&gt; [Bionic] doesn’t care about POSIX compliance. It doesn’t even care about ANSI compliance...

We've actually put a lot of effort into this in recent years, specifically to ease porting cross-platform code.

&gt; If we try [building Lua] with a modern Android NDK we get [a] build failure.

If this talk was given around the same time as the article was date, this ""modern"" NDK is about a year old. We've made some really rapid progress in the last year.

To match your Turbo-C for MS-DOS example ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jvLY5pUwic)), we can build fresh out of the box:

    $ git clone https://github.com/lua/lua
    $ cd lua
    $ $NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py \
        --arch arm --api 21 --install-dir toolchain
    $ toolchain/bin/clang *.c -lm -o lua

We set our minimum target as 21 (Lollipop) because the C library locale APIs weren’t in place until then (we’ve long maintained the stance that any useful locale aware code needs ICU anyway, but we added them for exactly this kind of compatibility). We can actually make this work all the way back to the minimum supported target (currently 14, Ice Cream Sandwich) by taking advantage of the NDK’s `libandroid_support` (used to paper over the cracks in old releases):

    $ $NDK/build/tools/make_standalone_toolchain.py \
        --arch arm --api 14 --stl libc++ \
        --install-dir toolchain --force
    $ toolchain/bin/clang *.c -landroid_support -lm -o lua

Works fine on my Galaxy Nexus running ICS.

The MS-DOS example does not enable `libreadline` support. To match your example, neither have I. Probably not something you need for including Lua as a scripting engine in your game, but I decided to give it a shot for the sake of completeness.

Lua can build with `libreadline` support with the absolute latest NDK (r15, and you need a nightly build of the beta at that) and only when targeting Android O (explained in more detail in the linked project). The only real trouble is that you have to also build `libreadline` and `libncurses`, and both of those need minor patches (none of which are the NDK’s fault, fwiw).

I've uploaded examples of how to do both of these [here](https://github.com/DanAlbert/lua-ndk).

&gt; The NDK provides five different C++ standard libraries you have to choose from.

I completely agree that this is a problem, and this is why the last two years of work have been stepping stones to fixing this. If you check [our roadmap](https://android.googlesource.com/platform/ndk/+/master/docs/Roadmap.md), you can see that we’re narrowing this down to just libc++. We just want to make sure we’re not giving a degraded experience in the meantime.

&gt; The Android NDK provides almost no libraries we are responsible for building every library we need and shipping it with our app.

We’re working on this too. ICU will be one of the first things we make available once we get some plumbing in place.",1493597332

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","TL;DR: the two are infinitely close, and we (sorta-)define infinitely close numbers to be the same.

It's actually quite difficult to nail down what a real number is. One definition of real numbers is as ""sequences of rational numbers which get arbitrarily close to each other"" [searchable term: (equivalence classes of) Cauchy sequences]. Decimal expansions are one example of this, such as the sequence (0.3, 0.33, ...) for 1/3.

Two real numbers are ""equal"" (i.e., the sequences are actually the same real number) if their sequences get arbitrarily to each other after enough terms.

Then, you can see that the sequences (0.9, 0.99, 0.999, ...) and (1, 1.0, 1.00, ...) get arbitrarily close to each other (by which I mean, for any rational number q, |1.000...-0.999...|&lt;q once you get enough digits).

Thus, the number represented must be the same; i.e., 0.999...=1.000...",1493597334

"The_Donald","t5_38unr","&gt; I would love to hear you tell either of those two statements that to any current, past or aspiring MD regardless of their political leanings. 

&gt;Why didn't you first make that statement if that's truly your belief, you are okay in a world where high school drops practice basic surgery on each other if they have belief in themselves.

It should absolutely be legal for one uneducated adult to perform surgery on another uneducated adult if they both legally consent beforehand, with notarization or a lawyer or witnesses, as is present in any hospital today. 

In reality, this would almost never happen, even in a free market, unless one of the uneducated adults happened to be a prodigy in surgery, and was already renowned for it.

Freedom means you have no right to tell other adults whether they can or cannot enter into a consensual contract or transaction.

&gt;Meaning you are okay living in a society where a &lt;18 year old can perform surgery, meaning someone above or below the age range that goes to high school.

Straw man argument. High school dropout != minor &lt;18. I am not arguing for letting children enter into any contract.

&gt;How in such a society would you prevent this from being used as a out for murder? Or skyrocket the rates of harm done by surgical accident or experimental pharmaceutical treatment?

How do we prevent doctors from using their profession as an out for murder in the present? Criminal and civil liability. A doctor can go to jail for manslaughter or negligence. A doctor can be sued for wrongful death. The same would apply in a free market. One of the primary proper roles of government is to enforce contracts and civil liability and to prosecute obvious murderers. It can be more difficult with medical professionals to tell where negligence crosses over into murder, but it could be applied just as well in a free market.

Again, though, this would be handled most of the time by most consumers not making stupid decisions. For example, Michael Jackson arguably committed suicide by hiring a doctor and purchasing drugs. And he had every moral right to do so. You have no moral right to stop Michael Jackson from hiring a morally uninhibited doctor and taking as many pills as he desires; it is his money, his body, and his freedom of association, not yours. After Michael Jackson's death, his doctor still had to face criminal and civil liability, which is the proper role of government in that case. Medical licensure didn't save Michael Jackson's life, and the outcome would have been the same in a free market, because an adult has the right to put anything they want into their own body.

&gt;If markets are not free then specialization cannot occur

&gt;Markets that are not free do not have specialization 

No, I didn't state this. You are making the [""Denying the Antecedent""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denying_the_antecedent) fallacy.

I argued that specialization would occur more in a truly free market. Some specialization has occurred even in this mostly unfree market, but more specialization would occur in a free market. Every doctor being required to get 16 years of education is nowhere near optimal, and it is a product of government interference and artificial barriers in the health care market.

&gt;You want the freest medical market to allow the possibility of children prescribing and doing amateur surgery?

This is either a straw man or misinterpretation of what I wrote above. By ""high school dropout"" I meant people who failed to earn their high school diploma. I was using it to discuss a lack of certification/formal education, not a lack of age. If I wanted to argue that children should be allowed to perform surgery, I would have written ""anyone, even people under the age of 18, should be free to purchase or sell any goods and services."" But I didn't write that. Throughout my comments, I have argued that two consenting adults should be free to buy and sell any good and service they desire, and you have no moral right or imperative to stop them.",1493597341

Brave is also a practical company. They don't see decentralization as the solution fits all. They'd use centralized servers if needed (until a solution is now in place). With that, it can be possible to maybe just limit the token earnings by IP address. And do some analysis to find and ban the bots.

Wouldn't his suicide have the same outcome, a Republican taking his spot. A horrible as it is that his sons homosexuality being used as blackmail, I feel like quietly resigning and giving health reasons would have been an easier way out. 

He also claimed he didn't want his sons secret to be dragged out during his election. It doesn't say he was ashamed, without more detail it just seemed like he wanted to protect his son from other people, it was the 50's after all. The counter culture movement hadn't started yet. Also he said he didn't want to re-election to have a negative health effect on his wife, but I'd wager his suicide probably had some negative effect on her. 

Just seems like he had an easier out that suicide. Only other thing is that health might have been the deciding factor. The article both states that it was no secrete that he had kidney problems, and the later states that he had no serious health issues  

Edit:

I'm just saying it didn't seem like he killed himself because he was afraid of his reputation getting ruined. The wiki paints it in a way that he chose suicide to protect his family, but I think stepping down would have protected his family even more.

In the course of last five years I did a lot of Ketamine. At first it was very intensive, glitchy... completely distorted perception and thinking. But, over time, my brain got used to the SRI/NMDA part of the trip, to the point where I can be completely functional on ketamine. Like drive a car or even write computer code. I've either completely fried my receptors, or my brain learned to filter out the distortion.     
But, I've noticed the ability to imagine my entire timeline as a whole on Ketamine, even when it feels like it didn't really hit me. Or to actually think in n-dimensional space.    
A point in 3D space is just a collection of values [X,Y,Z] which is very logical to us. But, add another dimension, and you're really struggling to imagine a shape or a body. Ever heard of quaternions? It's a mathematical construct to rotate a set of coordinates trough the fourth dimension. If you haven't, check out the [imagining 10 dimensions](https://youtu.be/hf2CxZPl7KI) video, to get the mood of it all.   
Back to my drug abuse. At the time, I had a fairly good understanding of serotonin pathway and how MDMA, LSD and mushrooms work, and understood that patterns come from different affinity of certain molecules to different subsets of receptors, and how certain patterns emerge when cells are dividing. I also attributed the ketamine ketamine glitch to SRI effect: for neurone to fire, you need a change in number of active serotonin receptors in the synapse. Since reuptake is blocked by ketamine, you have a fixed number of serotonin molecules circulating in the synapse, so on average a fixed number of receptors is active, and no change means no firing of the neurone.

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","I struggled with social anxiety through adolescence into early adulthood. I was very social as child, but became very withdrawn in my teens, and it carried well into my mid-twenties. I sought help on my own, often searching out and reading books on the topic. Very few did any good, until I read How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie. As an aspiring entrepreneur, you should be able to digest a good book, and this will help on both fronts.

I am glad you are getting over your social anxiety, but regret to say that I think you are drifting towards sociopathy and/or religious fanaticism, and people you associate with may be better off not knowing the thoughts that are in your head, should you open your mouth and let them know. I do not know of any books that would help with this issue. However, should someone express that they had lost a loved one to suicide in person, I really hope that you would not proceed to lecture them on sin, as one example. To many this would put you in the category of ""some sort of religious nut job,"" which based on your own words is adverse to how you'd like to be perceived. ",1493597344

Everyone who wronged her felt scared and guilty, and that gave a sense revenge. Not sure if you're old enough to remember the copycat teen suicides after Kurt Cobain died, but a lot [psychologists are worried about the contagion effect from this show](https://www.google.com/amp/amp.usatoday.com/story/307592001/).

I personally didn't like how the girl's friends were all scared of the legal ramifications because things are common and innocuous as ending a friendship over a boy (even if it involves a slap) or making a ""best features"" list of the girls in your class are portrayed as legitimate reasons to implicate people in a girl's decision to kill herself. Or, **spoiler alert**, how she tried to make her friend feel guilty for slapping her and ending their friendship, while she herself didn't stop someone from raping this friend - and yet the friend is someone the guilty one. It just makes the person who committed suicide as seeming to be all-knowing and wise, and everyone else just a remorseful or scared pawn - which is a very dangerous message to send to a specific subset of teens who already have suicide and non-violent revenge ideations.",1493597344

Different people, when presented with the same idea, will naturally form different conclusions. As I said in my first comment, rights are a concept. I don't really care if someone does or doesn't believe that they exist objectively, I only care about how we as people can have a discussion as to how to maximize human liberty.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The German invasion of Belgium.  


First off, it was a neutral country. If you are the opposition, they are literally *giving*you propaganda that paints you as a monster, a nation that derives it's imperial power off of the soul of weaker nations. You are the nations that disregards self-determination, nation's wishes and are now engaged in an all out, complete mobilization war economy against other powers.  


In addition, the British were unsure whether they wanted to enter the war.  There is a great deal of debate on this topic whether they were or weren't.  There were rumors that they were going to tell the Germans that they wouldn't enter the war!  But everything goes out the window once Germany invades Belgium.  If I recall correctly, the British empire would intervene in a defensive war should Belgium be invaded by external forces.  


Lastly, the entire purpose of going through Belgium was that it was supposed to be quick.  They did not expect resistance, they expected the Belgians to cower and throw their weapons down.  As we know now, they resisted enough to stall the German forces. In addition, they also were able to demonstrate what the war would come to face. The defensive technology had outpaced the offensive technology so much so that even smaller nations like Belgium could cause sizable casualties, relative to size. 


Naturally, the Germans would still penetrate their defenses quickly and gain enough ground to invade France, but in the invasion, machine gun nests, artillery, kill holes, barbed wire, all these things would result in a meat grinder scenario.


Could the entire war have changed if they didn't invade Belgium? Possibly.  But we know what happened when did go through Belgium, and this would shape the history of the twentieth century.",1493597349
"intj","t5_2qowo","I'm seconding therapy because it's useful, with a caveat: For me, therapy is important but it's also a bit of a cheat, because getting into my own head is too easy and gives me the false sense I've done something hard.

If you're anything like me--never athletic and living in your head--what might also be good is to get some exercise, something like yoga or pilates where you're focusing on the nuances of different physical feelings within your body. Eat and savor flavors, when you have a stomachache pay attention to where and how it hurts, whatever connects you to your physicality. Emotions often have a physical component as well, and you'll be better able to identify your emotional reactions when you know what it's like to live in your whole body, not just your brain.

To develop compassion, think about the things that make life harder for you, the systems where you don't fit in. Are your religious beliefs non-dominant in your area? Have you had someone in your life die? Even just being a woman means you're operating within a system that has certain expectations of you that you won't always live up to and might resent or at least find get in your way. Either way, you must have had some experience of kicking against the larger social system, losing something or someone you loved, etc. 

When others bring up their own struggles (illness, job loss, rejection, grief), use that brain to imagine how you would feel in that situation--not what you would do in response, but how you would feel. Frustrated? Indignant? Powerless? Give yourself time to feel it. It takes practice, and I can't always call it up on command or when I'm with someone I'm not comfortable around, but the practice has helped me access those feelings more quickly and actually empathize.",1493597349

There is a very good chance she doesn't know because no one wants to go near the subject.  My advice is to talk to her about it.

"CatholicPolitics","t5_3cfrp","I have a few thoughts. If mainstream democrats and their supporters also call themselves progressive despite the clear differences between your views and theirs, why continue to use the lable? I'm a traditionalist, so I have to deal with this same problem when it comes to sedevacantists calling themselves traditional. In response, I argue that sedes are acting against the *first* Vatican council's dogmatic definition that the papacy is not a temporary office that will go away before Christ returns. Do you have a similar argument based on Progressivism that the mainstream Democrats and their supporters fail to meet the standards of their own ideaology?

I actually agree with what you say about subsidiarity and capitalism. The former does not always mean a thing should be done on the local or state level, just the smallest *appropriate* level. There certainly are duties appropriate for the federal government. But it seems to me that most Democrats (and a lot of Republicans  too, to be fair) *default* to working on the federal level without considering if certain functions would be more efficiently done by the states, and this has added to our debt problems. And both major parties seem more than happy to push this debt onto our future generations rather than seriously try to fix it asap. 

As for Capitalism, it does usually place the employer and employee in competition with each other, which means *very* few places meet the demands of justice, neither towards the boss nor towards the worker. I don't know about personalism, but the moral relativism of the ""free market"" definitely doesn't fit well with Catholic Social Doctrine (except in the vague sense, where both boss and worker are free to live by those values, just as their neighbor is free to act like pre-christmas-ghosts Scrooge).

It's really fucking annoying when a good brand places his W so you have to run towards him or run back and eat the W. Sometimes just running forwards and missing the W can be better, even if you have to run in to the enemy duo because he can't get the stun off with his Q, he'll have to use his E first then his Q, which is easy to dodge.

Or, you can just play back, eventually he'll get bored (probably, hopefully) and start going for 'risky' W's that you can easily dodge. Go in to a custom or 1v1 with a friend on brand and learn the range like the back of your hand.

Brand is squishy so harass the shit out of him at level 1 and when he misses his spells, make him use all his pots early so he'll have to play back/scared. Feels so bad playing a mage support with no sustain when you're too low to be useful in lane.",1493597356

You don't have to get angry or yell, all you do is offer up the facts. I'm Chaldean, I refuse to live in a community of separatists. That is why I like to educate people on our history. Fortunately, many Chaldeans (although they still identify as Chaldean) are accepting the facts that they are simply a sub-group of Assyrians.

But that is because when seeing the show the second time through you can see how everything comes together, how the story properly lead up and follows through with its plot points, and that puts an interesting new perspective on the show.

You mean in the audience? If random people are allowed in the audience, then sure, nobody would know or care that they were a lawyer, so they could sit with everyone else.

But that's not relevant to anything, because a lawyer sitting around not allowed to speak doesn't help anyone. They may as well be back at the office for all the good that it does.

Note that I was careful of my phrasing to try to avoid this misunderstanding, where I said ""to use"":

&gt; neither party is allowed to use their lawyers 

and quoted can't *represent* from the government site:

&gt; not allowed to have a lawyer represent you

I never said they weren't allowed in the building, or in the room, or whatever.

The big advantage of having a lawyer in a regular court is that they understand the law and the court procedures, whereas most non-lawyers really don't, leading to figuratively fatal mistakes.

In small claims court, everyone is potentially more equal by not having lawyers to advise and/or speak for them, and the judge goes out of his way to be patient (up to a point) with reasonable polite people who don't know the law.",1493597360

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I had been considering something like mobile SAM launchers. Ground vehicles have the advantage of being able to support significantly more weight than a ship. Essentially any type of fighting ship still has to be concerned about its weight. So yeah, a retaliator can carry a lot of missiles. But you could mount them on a truck half its size (slightly exaggerating). Something like a modern mobile SAM could easily threaten an area. Trucks/vehicles with guns would be great at close support, or anti vehicle support for ground FPS gameplay. But with a 2-3km range, not really threatening enough for ships that can move 200m/s. So imo you'd need like S4+ missiles with 20km+ range. We also have utility equipment like area shield domes etc. that haven't really been discussed. Perhaps upgraded radar arrays that add accuracy to nearby guns/missile launchers, to counter flares or chaff. 

Maybe a 200m shield bubble, and a couple launchers would be dangerous enough to make someone think twice about flying up and dumping a couple fps squads. They'd have to drop in their own ground vehicles and hoof it from a bit outside of defense range.

I feel like we will start seeing a few more ground vehicles come out once we have someplace to drive them around. Despite the fact that they are not on the schedule (with the exception of the Nox, no new concepts are on the schedule). And the ship pipeline if ramping up pretty well. Not to mention that towards the end of the year, it's mostly the bigger ships left in the pipeline. So my guess (total speculation here) is that people will be working on some of the smaller, unannounced concept ships/vehicles. ",1493597362

Going from AMD to Intel or vice versa will mean changing not only your motherboard, but your RAM as well. (And that can add $150-ish to the price of your upgrade CPU if you get a mid-tier mobo).

My #2 advice is to pick a motherboard that is compatible both with your cheap first CPU AND what you think you'll want for your first upgrade. The metric ""TDP"" (thermal design power) is the one that can help you with future proofing. Even though CPUs are being designed for lower power rather than higher performance these days, making sure motherboard TDP is higher than your cheap CPU's TDP is a safe move.

If you can make #1 and #2 happen, then you'll most likely only have to buy a new chip when you upgrade. You can keep your old motherboard and RAM.

Sanders compares the Naqba to the Trail of Tears.  

Signing a document saying The United Nations is unbalanced in its treatment of Israel doesn't mean he ""endorses the Occupation"".  The letter asks for equal treatment of Israel as compared to other countries.  

&gt;since its formation in 2006, the United Nations Human Rights Council has passed more resolutions condemning Israel than any other country.

&gt;But more eye-opening is that it’s condemned Israel more times than every other country combined.

&gt;The Geneva-based U.N. Watch counted all of the resolutions out and summed up the findings in one stunning table: https://twitter.com/HillelNeuer/status/613899574047076352/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theblaze.com%2Fnews%2F2015%2F06%2F25%2Fthe-u-n-s-treatment-of-israel-summed-up-in-one-stunning-graphic%2F

&gt;UNHRC resolutions condemning countries that were not Israel totaled 55 over nearly a decade. By contrast, Israel was targeted 61 times.

&gt;U.N. Watch executive director Hillel Neuer compared Israel’s treatment with that granted to its Middle East neighbors who don’t exactly hold the most exemplary human rights records:

&gt;Total UNHRC Condemnations

&gt;&gt;Israel 61

&gt;&gt;Sudan 2

&gt;&gt;Libya 2

&gt;&gt;Egypt 0

&gt;&gt;Saudi Arabia 0

&gt;&gt;Yemen 0

&gt;U.N. Watch accused the world body of engaging in “endemic selectivity and politicization” for nine years. Not only did the number of resolutions overwhelmingly target Israel, countries with poor human rights records have been awarded seats on the council.

&gt;“Sadly, with members like China, Russia, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Venezuela and Qatar, the UNHRC today may possibly rank as a more corrupt international organization than FIFA,” U.N. Watch said in a statement, referring to the scandal-ridden international soccer federation.

From the Chicago Sun-Times - “Saudi Arabia has a horrendous human-rights record — recently a blogger was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for ‘insulting Islam’ — but not only is Riyadh not criticized, it’s given a seat on the council,” wrote Steve Huntley.

"ReddLineNews","t5_3hyku","**Amid Brick-and-Mortar Travails, a Tipping Point for Amazon in Apparel**




SEATTLE — If future anthropologists want to study the rubble of early-21st-century retail, a good place to start will be what Amazon.com did to apparel shopping in the few years before and after 2017.


The outlook for physical retailers is grim, the sector roiled by store closings, layoffs and bankruptcies. This year, Amazon will surpass Macy’s, which last year announced it would shut 100 stores, to become the largest seller of apparel in America, by several analysts’ estimates.


It is looking at ways to keep expanding, too. Amazon is exploring the possibility of selling custom-fit clothing, tailored to the more precise measurements of customers, and it has considered acquiring clothing manufacturers to further expand its presence in the category.


If there are tipping points in retail — moments when shopping behavior swings decisively in one direction — there’s a strong case to be made that apparel is reaching one now, with broad implications for jobs, malls and shopping districts.


Those moments often occur around the time that online shopping reaches about 20 percent of total national retail spending in a category, the research firm L2 has concluded after studying the evolution of e-commerce. Online clothing and accessory shopping’s share of retail hit 21 percent last year, according to estimates by Cowen and Company, a stock research firm.


“I do think this year is the year apparel e-commerce takes off,” said Cooper Smith, an analyst at L2.


Apparel has been something of an e-commerce laggard. In years gone by, buying clothing over the internet was only for the fearless, with most shoppers unwilling to take the risk that a dress or a pair of shoes would fit poorly or look terrible on them.


It took time, but shopping habits for clothing are shifting profoundly.


Amazon’s solution was to improve clothing selection, pour money into photography to give internet shoppers a better representation of garments and offer free returns on most apparel so customers could order untroubled by the thought of sending items back.


Pia Arthur, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment for this article.


Amazon is by far the biggest beneficiary of e-commerce growth, accounting for 43 cents of every dollar spent online in the nation last year, estimated Slice Intelligence, a company that measures online shopping.


But there’s little chance Amazon will come to have in apparel the crushing dominance it has established in, say, books, because of the way clothing sales are fragmented among so many retailers. Amazon accounts for half the country’s consumer book market on a unit basis, according to the Codex Group, a book market research firm.


Last year, the company’s gross merchandise apparel sales — Amazon’s direct sales of clothing plus the commission it collects on sales by independent merchants on its site — were $22 billion, or 6.6 percent of the market, Cowen estimated. By 2021, the firm has forecast, Amazon will account for just over 16 percent of apparel sales.


“We look at it as winner take most,” said John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen. “That’s their game.”


Still, Amazon faces hurdles in its apparel business. Some apparel makers have been frustrated by the prevalence of counterfeit versions of their products on Amazon, peddled by independent merchants.


Last year, Birkenstock, the sandal maker, stopped selling its footwear directly to Amazon, becoming one of the biggest brands to cease doing business with the retailer. Since then, Birkenstock has warmed somewhat to Amazon, allowing authorized independent sellers to continue to sell its products on the site.


“We have seen improvements on the Amazon marketplace addressing our core issues of unauthorized sellers and counterfeit goods,” said Dania Shiblaq, a spokeswoman for Birkenstock USA, adding that the company still does not directly sell to Amazon.


The idea of buying clothing without first trying it on is still a deal breaker for many shoppers, even with the security of free returns. Amazon executives look at such hurdles as “friction,” which they are constantly seeking to eliminate.


“Anytime you make something simpler and lower friction, you get more of it,” Jeffrey P. Bezos, the company’s chief executive and founder, wrote in a letter to shareholders in 2007, after the company made getting a book nearly instantaneous with the original Kindle.


One idea Amazon is considering to lubricate apparel shopping: custom-fit clothing. The company’s apparel team is exploring the possibility of offering “on-demand” clothing that would be made only after a customer submitted an order, using the customer’s precise measurements, according to a person briefed on the discussions who asked for anonymity because they were confidential.


The group has described its intentions as “five-day custom” in an internal presentation, the source said. In April, Amazon received a patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing, though that is no guarantee it will pursue the plan.


If it works, the plan could make shoppers happier by delivering clothing that looks better on them, while also addressing the ruinous consequences that returns can have on the profits of internet apparel retailers. It’s not uncommon for shoppers to order three sizes of a shirt or dress and send back two.


About 35 percent of all apparel orders are returned, said Stefan Weitz, chief product and strategy officer for Radial, a company that runs e-commerce operations for other brands and retailers.


“That has huge impact on customer experience and satisfaction and also on that retailer’s P and L,” said Drew Green, chief executive of Indochino, an internet retailer of custom-fit suits, referring to profit and loss statements. Mr. Green said fewer than 1 percent of Indochino’s orders were returned.


Amazon could use its growing private-label apparel business as the springboard for any custom-fit clothing it starts. It already sells cashmere sweaters, dresses and men’s suits under brands like Buttoned Down, Lark &amp; Ro and Paris Sunday.


Amazon has also considered acquisitions to increase its apparel manufacturing expertise. According to the person with knowledge of discussions within the company’s apparel group, Amazon has considered buying Indochino. This person also said it had mulled a bid for American Apparel during its bankruptcy auction, which Reuters first reported in January. (A Canadian apparel company, Gildan Activewear, won the auction.)


Mr. Green declined to comment about whether Amazon had made an offer for Indochino.


There’s still the matter of how Amazon would get a customer’s precise measurements. Indochino’s answer has been to coach customers to do the measurements themselves, and to open showrooms where Indochino employees can do the measurements for them. (Its 13th store opened on Friday.)


Amazon has developed a camera and scanning software designed to automatically determine customers’ measurements and upload them to their accounts, according to the person familiar with Amazon’s apparel talks, who saw an early prototype of the device.


The source said the device resembled a camera product that Amazon announced last week, Echo Look, the latest in a line of gadgets powered by the company’s Alexa intelligent assistant.


Amazon has described the device as a kind of digital fashion adviser, allowing people to upload photographs of themselves to get style recommendations through a combination of software algorithms and human fashion specialists. The company declined to say whether the device would be updated in the future to capture clothing sizes for customers.

ISTANBUL — A dissident Iranian television executive was assassinated in Istanbul on Saturday evening, months after he was sentenced in absentia to a six-year prison term by an Iranian court for spreading propaganda.


Saeed Karimian, the owner of Gem TV, a network of television channels that broadcasts in Farsi and other languages, was shot as he drove through an upscale neighborhood of northern Istanbul “minutes after leaving his office,” Gem announced on Sunday. Also killed was his Kuwaiti business partner, whose name has not been released.


The assailants fled, and their vehicle was found abandoned and partly destroyed in another part of Istanbul, according to reports by Gem and several Turkish news outlets. Sukru Genc, the mayor of the district in Istanbul where the attack occurred, confirmed the killing in an interview. The attackers’ motive was not immediately clear. Mr. Genc said he had been told by police investigators that Mr. Karimian had been killed because of “a dispute over money.”


Mr. Karimian’s company has made dozens of soap operas and holds the broadcasting rights to several famous Turkish dramas. Gem, which has offices in Istanbul and Dubai, has expanded beyond its Farsi programming and also broadcasts in Arabic, Azeri and Kurdish.


“At this stage, all I know is that the most likely motivation behind the assassination could have been financial disputes between Mr. Karimian and his wide networks of business partners from Dubai to Malaysia,” said Ali Vaez, the senior Iran analyst for the Crisis Group, a research institute focusing on international affairs.


Others sensed the hand of the Iranian state. The National Council of Resistance of Iran, an exiled opposition group, claimed that Mr. Karimian was assassinated by Iran’s Revolutionary Guard on the orders of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the country’s head of state. Iran has been accused of assassinating Iranian exiles in the past, most recently Abbas Yazdi, an Anglo-Iranian businessman who was kidnapped in Dubai in 2013 and is now thought to be dead.


In January, an Iranian court announced in a judicial newspaper that Mr. Karimian had been sentenced to six years in prison for spreading propaganda against the country’s Islamic government, and acting against national security. The Iranian government sees westernized entertainment, such as the types of series broadcast by Mr. Karimian, as a threat to the conservative society it has built in Iran since seizing power in a revolution in 1979.


While satellite dishes are banned in Iran, they are widely used, and millions of Iranians watch Gem’s programming. “The regime is very sensitive about culturally subversive media and entertainment broadcast from overseas,” said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “Khamenei believes this is precisely the U.S. strategy — to overthrow the Islamic Republic via a soft revolution,” he said.


Mr. Karimian had suggested that he hoped his work would change Iranian society. “We will do our best to create an Iran one day that we can take pride in,” Mr. Karimian said in comments that were broadcast posthumously on his own network on Sunday. Analysts said it was possible that Mr. Karimian might have been targeted by the state. “One cannot rule out the possibility that he posed a serious threat to a powerful stakeholder in Iran,” Mr. Vaez said. But he added that Mr. Karimian “doesn’t fit” the profile of someone important enough for the Iranian government to assassinate on foreign soil.


The Iranian Embassy in Turkey, the Turkish Foreign Ministry and Gem did not respond to requests for comment.

Imagine opening an old shed by the side of the road and finding a 19th-century painting by a master artist. That’s what happened to me recently in the small, indigenous village of Old Massett — except the ancient art was a totem pole, and a master carver, Christian White, led me there.


Haida Gwaii, this cluster of islands 70 miles off the northwest coast of Canada, was once known for its totem poles, tall and regal, like the temples of Angkor Wat.


In 1862, a smallpox epidemic wiped out most of the 10,000 to 30,000 members of the Haida Nation living here. Many of the totem poles that adorned and surrounded their long houses were carted off by collectors and museum curators. Others were absorbed back into the forest, like this one I came across in the former village site of Yan.


In 1884, the Canadian government outlawed potlatches, the public ceremonies that formed the basis of the Haida legal and political system. Because totem poles were intricately tied to potlatches, the ban essentially spelled the end of poles. The ban was finally lifted, and in 1969 the first new monumental totem pole in almost a century was raised ceremoniously in Haida Gwaii.


Since then, a dozen free-standing poles have gone up around the Haida reserve of Old Massett. The interesting thing about them is that they are not recreations of old poles or commemorative pieces remembering the height of Haida culture. They are modern tributes that recognize recent events, like the inauguration of a new hereditary chief or the opening of a new building.


During my visit to the village, I heard that Mr. White, a well-known argillite carver, was working on a new totem pole — his fifth. When I dropped by his work shed, his son Vernon was chipping away at it.


The pole will be huge — 51 feet long, with an additional 11 feet in the ground. It came from a 600-year-old red cedar that Mr. White picked out. It took him and his team weeks to strip away the bark, flatten one side, hollow out the rot and finally start the carving. That they do with hand tools, like chisels and axes, not much different from what their ancestors used centuries ago.


The Old Massett Village Council commissioned Mr. White to build the pole for a village named Hiellen. He decided to copy many of the images — mostly clan crests — from a pole that was built in 1820 and was at one time attached to a chief’s long house in Hiellen. It will take his team of three carvers six months to complete the pole.


Assuming the ancient pole was long gone, I asked Mr. White if the carvers were working from a photo of it. His answer surprised me: They were working off tracings of the original. “It’s in a container,” he said.


He agreed to take me there — to this old wooden shed behind the village’s former school. Its door was held precariously shut with an old nail. Mr. White pried it open using a hammer.


There was the pole — 197 years old, cut or rotted into two long pieces.


I crept inside and gazed in wonder. The detailing was marvelous. I could detect a carving of a face inside a bear’s eye.


I couldn’t help but also marvel at how the old pole was being stored. It spoke to me of many things — the fact that the Haida residents of Old Massett, faced with 70 percent unemployment, have more pressing issues than preserving history, but also a lack of nostalgia for Haida culture, perhaps because people are still living it.


For Mr. White, this ancient pole is a teaching tool. “I’m involved in creating new things,” he said. “Some people say we should let it go back to the earth.”

"ReddLineNews","t5_3hyku","**In France’s Poor Suburbs, Angry Voters May Skip Big Election**




STAINS, France — For voters in the poorer, largely immigrant suburbs of Paris, the motivation to turn out for France’s presidential runoff seems clear: to defeat Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, who has pitched her campaign against immigrants and Muslims.


The other candidate, the centrist Emmanuel Macron, would seem to be an easy alternative. But the reality of this election cycle in towns like Stains, where public frustration is high over the failure of politicians to deliver on past promises, is that many voters may simply choose to stay home on May 7 for the critical, final vote.


“Don’t count on the working-class neighborhoods this year to save France,” said Inès Seddiki, a 26-year-old French-Muslim in Stains, whose parents came from Morocco.


Although Ms. Seddiki said she would vote reluctantly for Mr. Macron, she feared she was an exception: “White people who say ‘You have to vote against Marine Le Pen because you will lose more than we will’ don’t realize that for us, we already live in a racist country.”


In the first round of the presidential election on April 23, voters in many poorer Parisian suburbs did turn out, but for the fiery candidate on the extreme left, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, who channeled the anger of communities neglected by the political system. And many also chose not to vote. That second option — not voting — is now a real possibility in the final round for those who previously voted for Mr. Mélenchon, even though they arguably have the most at stake.


Just how many voters abstain could determine whether Ms. Le Pen can upend expectations and beat Mr. Macron. The prevailing assumption is that a broad majority of voters — a so-called Republican Front that includes the poorer suburbs — will come together behind Mr. Macron in the name of turning back Ms. Le Pen and the far right. But a low turnout could threaten this belief and help Ms. Le Pen.


In France’s poor suburbs, many French are of Arab extraction with parents or grandparents who came from Algeria, Morocco or Tunisia. Many are also from sub-Saharan Africa; the former French colonies of Ivory Coast, Mali, Senegal and Togo; and what was once French Indochina, today’s Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam. For them, neither the right nor the left has delivered when it comes to making jobs more available and reducing discrimination.


Recent terrorist attacks have worsened the  stigma attached to immigrants and Muslims. A number of the house searches after the terror attacks in and around Paris on Nov. 13, 2015, were conducted by police in Seine-St.-Denis, the political jurisdiction that includes Stains.


“The second round is a catastrophe,” said Cheker Messaoudi, 29, a Frenchman of Tunisian heritage. “I think with Macron we are facing a war on the economy and with Le Pen we are facing a civil war, so it is bad both ways.”


With an abstention rate of 38 percent including blank ballots in contrast to 23.5 percent nationwide in the first round of the presidential election, Stains reflects a particularly high degree of disillusionment. A community of about 38,000 inhabitants on the outskirts of Paris, it voted overwhelmingly for Mr. Mélenchon, a former Trotskyite, who finished fourth. With Mr. Mélenchon out, many people see the race, as expressed in an old French saying, as a choice between “la peste et le choléra” (the plague and the cholera).


To many people here, the policy proposals of both candidates are unattractive: Ms. Le Pen proposes a law-and-order program that would place binational Muslims at higher risk of expulsion from the country if they are considered even remotely connected to those suspected of having terrorist links. She also has inveighed against wearing a head scarf in public.


Mr. Macron, a former banker, is seen as close to the moneyed elite. He is disparaged for his support for Uber, which employs many people at low wages and often under poor conditions. He worked as a minister to the Socialist president François Hollande, who promised improvements that never arrived.


Sociologists and political scientists who study France’s poorer suburbs with substantial minority populations, known here as banlieues, said neither candidate had given people much reason to vote for him or her.


“They are really tired of people talking about the banlieues but not doing anything,” said Julien Talpin, a researcher in political science at the University of Lille. “Macron in the banlieues is a kind of big failure. He appears to be an embodiment of the establishment, of the elite, and people can tell he’s not one of them.”


Mr. Macron received 22 percent of the vote in Stains.


Thomas Kirszbaum, a sociologist, says the demographics and voting patterns of the poorer suburbs are far more complex than is widely understood. Living together are people of immigrant background, who vote on the far left or not at all, and some longtime residents, usually white, but also some immigrants, who vote on the extreme right. In Stains, nearly 15 percent of voters favored Ms. Le Pen.


Then there is a small, new class of young entrepreneurs, both Muslims and non-Muslims, many of whom support Mr. Macron, who has made outreach to entrepreneurs a priority.


Mr. Talpin noted a big change from 2012, when the poor suburbs turned out in large numbers to vote for the Socialist Party candidate, Mr. Hollande; he was running against President Nicolas Sarkozy, whom many people opposed.


“They haven’t really mobilized so much against Le Pen,” he said, despite the xenophobic tone of her campaign. “They are somehow feeling they are experiencing that discrimination on a daily basis.”


Sitting in his office not far from the central square in Stains, the mayor, Azzédine Taïbi, who is Muslim, suggested that it would take someone who inspired people, as well as effective government programs, to get people to embrace the political system again.


“This is an electorate that has nothing more to lose,” he said. “For this reason, what I see in this election is a sense of abandonment from working-class people: Either we leave them in total hopelessness or we build hope with them through an alternative policy.”


Yassine Belattar, a popular stand-up comedian who grew up in the suburbs, said that anti-government feeling was significantly stronger this year because of Mr. Mélenchon, who ratified people’s sense of injustice and their fury at the system.


“He manipulates anger for his personal ends,” said Mr. Belattar, referring to Mr. Mélanchon, adding that the candidate’s refusal to endorse Mr. Macron helps Ms. Le Pen. Mr. Mélanchon announced on Friday that he would not vote for Ms. Le Pen but refused to endorse Mr. Macron.


Mr. Belattar said he intended to vote for Mr. Macron.


Yet the sense of betrayal is acute among many people, not least toward the Socialists who had promised change but failed to follow through.


“Hollande visited the suburbs but these were visits for the media,” said Slimane Abderrahmane, an assistant mayor in Bobigny, a neighboring suburb to Stains, where the abstention rate in the vote last week was 37 percent (including blank ballots). Mr. Mélenchon took 43 percent of the vote.


“Hollande promised social and economic programs,” he added. “He promised to end racial profiling. He was full of promises that people never saw come true.”


Mr. Abderrahmane said he was voting for Mr. Macron only because he was afraid that the situation for Muslims would get markedly worse under Ms. Le Pen.


However, his friend Sylvain Legér, a municipal counselor who is white and has spent his whole life in Bobigny, said that after voting for Mr. Mélenchon in the first round, he could not bring himself to vote for Mr. Macron. He instead will abstain.


“He’s for globalization 100 percent,” Mr. Legér said. “What does that mean when workers come from their own country, mix with French workers, and on one side you have young people who want to work and on the other you have people who come from elsewhere in Europe or from other countries and who work for less?”


On Friday, Catharine Bonté, 75, a former nurse’s aide, recalled writing letters to past presidents seeking help.


“They all helped me a bit with social care,” said Ms. Bonté, who is black. “And Giscard d’Estaing’s wife even came to support me once because I was a single mother and I was a victim of injustices and racism.”


“But Hollande, he never helped me; he never answered my letters,” she added. “So I understand the ones who gave up on voting. There is a lot of suffering here.”

I play only the inner city of a small town. The inner city stays blue where I and a few other res play. We don't drive and are always walking/biking the town.

Most of the area out of the inner city is green, and stays green and we can't drive out there.

That was the long reply to your question. There is a good chance that portals taken before the 5th might either stay blue or if they are captured by ENL they will just be turned back blue again by others with only the chance of now getting 2-4 res spots rather than 8.

You either:

1. Need to bust your ass so hard at your current job that promotions/large raises are a foregone conclusion

2.  Need to take on a second job that you use to exclusively pay off student loans.

On top of one of these two(or both), you also need a strict budget to abide by.  

Unfortunately, you currently have a mortgage payment without the house.  If you ever hope to own a house, you need to get rid of that payment.  If you want kids, you likely need to get rid of that payment.  If you want a nice car someday or whatever.  Get rid of that debt.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Also not a qualified expert but here are some thoughts:

1. Marketing and it's complete lack thereof in women's sports
2. Subliminal sexism. People are just generally more interested in things men do. If there's already an established and we'll marketed men's league, why should people spend their time, money, and energy on women. Plus I feel like a guy might get flack for saying ""did you catch the women's game last night?"" The main exception being UConn women's basketball, one of the most winning teams in all sports history (probably).
3. Some sort of chicken and egg thing between those too things. To spend money on marketing, people will have to think itll be effective. With the current state of affairs its probably not worth it since people don't care. But in order to care, people need some smart marketing.
4. Men tend to be more interested in watching sports than women. People like watching people they relate to.

"halo","t5_2qixk","I've definitely given some thought to this and have come to the conclusion that it would be possible to do. If you play a game like quake it definitely feels fast enough to have slide, and it doesn't have sprint, so it may be possible. I don't think that increasing the movement speed exponentially would be the best way to do it though because it would probably screw up the halo feeling. The best way to do it in my opinion would probably be to have a small (&lt;1sec) window of time after using thrusters where you can slide. That way base speed wouldn't have to be insanely high and sliding would still feel right because there would be enough momentum built up. (Plus, the thrust+slide+jump+crouch mobility trick would remain, and I love mobility tricks)

The perfect movement for a Halo game in my opinion would have Halo 2's mobility/movement with the addition of Halo 5's thrusters, but sprint and spartan charge are the only abilities I hate, and a lot of people like the others, so I'd be completely happy with a Halo game that functioned like the one in my original comment. It would play like the proper evolution of Halo, rather than what we have now which feels like Halo+some good innovation+popular FPS mechanics thrown in to make COD fans/non Halo players feel at home.",1493597379

You were talking about the 2DS. Why the ""??""?


I agree that the Wii Mini was a dumb decision (no internet or GameCube support? Really Nintendo?), but I don't get why people are freaking out so much about the New 2DS XL. Nintendo made the GBA Micro after the DS came out, and no one freaked out. So what makes the New 2DS XL so special?


&gt; Next time you wish a game was cheaper for your Switch, remember that you're paying extra for a bunch of retards in their company to construct and market a 2DS that nobody wants, that didn't improve gaming whatsoever.


Actually, there's quite a few $40 games for the Switch, and the games were the same price as the Wii U's games when they first came out.


The NES Classic was an event item. It was *never* meant to be a permanent product.

This is hardly saying that the dog is healthy.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","Sure. I found it in general to be a very sensible and un-gimmicky approach to potty training. Her whole thing, I guess, is about putting away the idea of kids being ""ready"" to use the potty and instead looking at when they are *capable* of being taught to use it. Like, you wouldn't expect you kid to one day just be ""ready"" to tie her shoes and start doing it on her own; you discern, as her parent, that it's time and that she's capable, and you teach her. Same idea. No sticker charts, no rewards, no punishments either -- just ""ok, we are going to put your diapers away because you are going to learn to use the potty"". And then you do, and then they do.

Glowacki says that the ideal potty training window is between 20-30 months: when they are old enough to have the physical and communication skills they need, but young enough that they're not yet engaging their wills in the way that, say, a three-year-old does. We trained right after my son turned two and will probably time it that way for our infant when it's her turn. And of course there is guidance provided on recognising the signs that your child is capable.

What I appreciated the most, I think, is that she gives really clear ""building blocks"" (or steps) for the whole process that make it easy to understand how to move your child's understanding from *totally clueless* -&gt; *I peed* -&gt; *I am peeing* -&gt; *I need to pee*. They also make it easy to figure out what/when something went wrong if you run into trouble... you just move back a block or two until they're rock solid, and then go on again. There are a lot of troubleshooting tips, and a lot of chapter addressing specific scenarios: working with daycare, younger than 20 months, older than 30 months, transitioning from elimination communication, common problems, etc. She also has some strategies for families who have kinda started potty training but not been consistent, and how to reset that process. It's very straightforward, and if you want more she also has a website, a YouTube channel, etc.

For us, our son was basically 100% trained for pee in about two weeks. Poops took closer to 5 or 6 weeks -- he just had trouble recognising the feeling of having to go before he had, well, started. But we got there! And having a two-year-old who toilets independently is *awesome*. 

Blah blah blah... that's my two cents off the top of my head, anyway. Feel free to ask follow-up questions :)",1493597385

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The young man's face was streaked with soot and grime, and his eyes were red with exhaustion. Flint offered him a steaming tin mug. He took a cautious sip, a bit of the tea spilling down his chin as he fought to steady his shaking hands. 

""Christ that's good..."" the youth murmured, pressing the hot metal cup against his forehead with obvious relief. ""I owe you people my life.""

He was seated at the base of an old red oak, a cook-fire a few paces away. The coffee pot still hung half-full above the low flames. Hilary Flint shrugged as he accepted a bowl of frumenty from Faith and spooned some of the thick porridge into his mouth.

""You owe us a great deal more than just your life, Mister....""

""Shaw, Rodger Shaw. With a Dee.""

""Right..."" said Flint slowly. ""Anyways, I just turned two Spriggans into fertilizer not half an hour ago. And I don't know who the fuck you are. So now you're gonna tell me exactly why I made the right choice shooting them.""

The young man, Faith guessed he was twenty though it was hard to say with Humans, spread out his hands in a conciliatory gesture.  

""Look, I know it seems bad, but I've had one hell of a bad day. I've been shot at, beaten and ran at least a dozen miles as fast as my legs could carry my sorry ass.""

""No kidding,"" shot Hilary Flint. ""So who were they?""

""Bandits. There's a whole nest of them prowling somewhere in Hell's Heights. Mostly they've kept to the foothills, extorting the hamlets there and jumping the odd caravan or trader who's fucking dumb enough to go through those passes. My village, Coopersdale, who pay them off occasionally in grain or salt pork. This time though, something set them off.""

""How? What set them off."" Faith asked, taking a sip of her own tea. The youth turned to her.

""Lady, I don't fucking know. They're bandits, half of them are as high as a fucking kites, and the other half is doped up on moonshine and rotgut. Maybe they couldn't take no for an answer from one of the girls. Maybe they thought our offer was insulting. Or maybe they just hadn't had a good fight in weeks. How the fuck does it matter?""

""How many? Numbers, weapons, equipment?"" growled Flint. 

""Two dozen, maybe a couple more. Fae muskets for the most part, a few hunting rifles as well. Tulor, their leader, he's got an AK.""

""You sure, kid?"" Flint asked dubiously. ""You're like what, seventeen? Have you ever seen one before? Just because it's heavy with a folding stock doesn't make it an AK. But that's beside the point. You're gonna lead us to this village and you're gonna like it.""

""Yeah, and why would you be stupid enough to take on two dozen bandits?""

""Because I need to see for myself if a Sprig really does have a Kalashnikov; never seen one with an AK-47. Be a first for me.""

That's definitely true because having all the latest games and systems is expensive, but I think gaming is probably the broadest shared interest among people 35 and under, and maybe that's why it's such a cultural battlefield. It's pretty easy for a lot of people to avoid (intentionally or not) people who aren't like them in daily life, but if you play any multiplayer games or are part of gaming communities, you're going to interact with people whose experiences are completely alien to you. And people don't know how to deal with that, so clashes happen. I really respect Dan and Arin for being just good people trying their best and admitting when they're wrong, even when I sometimes cringe at uninformed things they say. Like with Dan's story about the phrase ""new moon,"" people can't just expect everyone to know everything without being told.

My biggest issue with people like you is that you keep saying stuff like, ""why can't they come the legal way?"" while completely ignoring the fact that for most of the world, they don't qualify for any immigrant visas currently available. Look, I get it, I'm not saying the U.S. should just open its borders and let everyone in. A country has the right to determine who can immigrate, and the needs of the U.S. are different now than they were 100 years ago. At least, that's a legitimate argument worth debating.

However, insisting that ""there are legal ways for people that want something really bad"" has no basis in the current realities of immigration laws; it's simply something you want to believe in order to justify your worldview that ""people that come illegally are lazy/cheaters/line-jumpers who can't bother to go to a U.S. embassy abroad, fill out some forms, and get a visa... so they deserve what's coming to them"".

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt;Or is this actually happening back in time somewhere as Madoka rewrites history?

I suspect it's a conversation that actually happened with those two. Madoka became an entity that exists beyond time and space, and has a high level of control over the universe. If she wants to have a conversation with Mami and Kyouko about her wish, it would be trivial to accomplish compared to everything else she does.

&gt;Interesting to see Homura’s perspective that this is negative – I guess it makes sense that since she’s been working so hard to sacrifice herself for Madoka, she’d be upset that the reverse ended up happening

Homura's only goal is a safe and happy Madoka. Anything else than that is insufficient.

&gt;So I’m seeing some serious Jesus parallels going on here. I don’t know that I’m a fan of that; it’s just adding more symbolism to the already complicated soup the show has thrown together and it probably just creates more problematic consequences – and given how much of a hornet’s nest I seem to have kicked last episode by suggesting that this show’s symbolism may have unintended implications, I’d imagine I’d get a stronger response by trying to have a similar conversation about the Christian symbolism I’m seeing here.

I think the Christian parallels and symbolism aren't just something added to symbolism soup, but a core aspect of the show. The whole thing seems to be a Magical Girl take on Christian mythology. The girls making their wish is falling into temptation, with the Incubators serving as a stand-in for the devil as a tempter, and sin. They are thus damned to an eternity of suffering and despair as witches. Madoka becomes a Christ figure and takes that sin upon herself, allowing the girls to avoid that damnation. In a kind of Harrowing of Hell, Madoka herself becomes a witch and emerges triumphant. Madoka thus exists as an omnipresent, omniscient, and all powerful being providing salvation from damnation. 

There have been references and parallels all along, particularly of a Faustian nature (the contract, for example). There are, of course, also numerous places, sometimes quite notable, where they don't align -- Madoka becomes divine/she is not born as such, Madoka must sin to become the Christ figure, etc. However, I think that can come down this being a new take on the story.

[Rebellion](/s ""And we get a neat twist in Rebellion with Homura. While Kyubey is the devil as the tempter (particularly in a Faustian sense), Homura becomes something of a Islamic/Faustian/Miltonian mix of a devil. She descends into evil out of a love for God. It wouldn't be quite accurate to say that she believes mankind to be below God's attention like the devil of Faust, but out of her desire for God's happiness she thinks that Madoka's sacrifice was unnecessary. Homura as the devil believes her 'Hell' is better than the 'Heaven' that is being taken by the Law of the Cycle."")

I'm not religious, but I think it's overall something that adds to the show. It's a new take on a classic story, using a good mix of old and new ideas of various sources to create something interesting and worthwhile. ",1493597393

We also lose some contracts which will free some space for top players out of camp. Things are looking bright for how deep of stock we have in the system going into camp. Not having to play the playoffs also means our boys will be well rested and recovered from lingering injury pains and rehab, and we can start the season ready.

But if the Basic Assembler doesn't need those items, there's still the problem of making the leap to a full Refinery and Assembler setup, because you can't without a way to process silicon. They would need to add silicon to the materials an Arc Furnace can process. But if that's the case, why would you need a Basic Assembler in the first place? Just make a regular Assembler.

So, my guess is that they're going to make some significant changes to the regular Assembler, like make it much larger (2x2x2?) and more costly.",1493597395

Your previous posts were removed because you didn't flair them. And the removal notice told you how to do that. Which you didn't do.

**That said**, your question shouldn't be on ELI5 because it is based on a **false premise**. 

Your ""subconscious"" doesn't ""remember"" very single thought you have ever had. You *brain* stores these memories. Memories are easier to access the more connections they have to other memories, which is why it's harder for you to remember some things more than others.

Sure there are references to the republican party and Trump, but I think the main enemy in the album is ignorance, apathy, inequality and lack of emotion as world affairs become increasingly inhuman.

Now combine that with with over striding (in my mind, the really running injury culprit), you get excessive forces that get sent straight up the legs that could be mitigated by a few different techniques:  
   Midfoot striking   
   Forefoot striking   
   An increased cadence (footfalls per minute.  I've seen anywhere from 170-190)

Here's what I've done since I moved into my house.  I wish I had done them a lot sooner, but after a few super high electric bills, doing these things actually made a noticeable difference

1.  programmable thermostat - you already mentioned it, but I'll second that recommendation.

2.  [Switched all my bulbs to LEDs](http://bestairbnbhostingtips.com/led-light-bulbs-reduce-operating-costs/) - LEDs use 85-90% less energy than incandescents and don't give off any real amount of heat.  So they use less and don't produce heat which is awesome for people like us trying to keep the house cool.

3.  Keep you blinds/curtains closed, especiialy on the south facing windows.  The tint you are adding will help too!

4.  Attic tent - may or may not be applicable to your situation, but something to look into

5.  Turn your water heater temperature down - Check to see what it's set at.  I'm not an expert on water temperature, but 120 degrees seems to be good enough.

Hope this helps!",1493597403

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","One of my best friends went to the Philippines a few years ago. At the time she was *very* Christian so she was going with a religious organization. She was super gung-ho about it at first and put a lot of effort into raising the funds to pay for her flight.

It was life changing alright. She said she saw orphans literally living in gargantuan piles of trash, quite literally a dump. The organization she went with with would put on these little skits about how Jesus Christ loved them, and the kids knew the deal. They would sit and wait patiently through the skit knowing that they'd get a sandwich at the end. 

Basically, there was nothing being done to actually change the way of life of these poor children. The cycle of poverty would go on undisturbed.

Of course, not every experience is the same, so I don't mean to paint these sort of trips with such a broad brush. I'm just saying this was my friend's experience. She said the whole thing was extremely humbling and really rubbed her the wrong way.

When she arrived home she had a whole different outlook on the ""voluntourism"" trend. Many of the people she went with were posting on Facebook about how happy they were that they were able to change lives, posting pictures to the reception of comments like ""how cute! so proud of you! glad you could be a hero to these children!"" and the like.

She said it really bothered her that people could come away from that experience and still feel like they were some sort of savior.",1493597403

People use dating sites for two reasons: to find love and to hook up. If there isn't a reasonable expectation that you'll be successful at or one both, you won't participate.

I don't think the idea will work as a sub, truthfully.

What could work is to have a mutual agreement to allow dating posts on either sub. These posts should be flaired ""Black4Black"" and could have additional rules from other posts in the sub. Obviously, moderation would be necessary to protect OPs and maintain the integrity of the posts.

This way, people have a higher chance of finding an interested party. They are still shielded from harassment/bullying/etc. Also, it may allow black ladies a bit more comfort if they choose to make a post. (Look at how few ladies have posted on B4B.)

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","It was more of a realization that everyone else wasn't.  From a young age I loved playing sports and a big highlight of a good workout was feeling sore afterwards.  There were a few times as a kid that I was reveling in the fact that I had a nice sore feeling going and when I mentioned it people reacted as though I was complaining.  It wasn't until my early twenties that I sort of made the connection that there were many types of pain that others found uncomfortable that I found pleasant.

After some introspection, I am pretty sure that it is at least somewhat related to being an adrenaline junkie.  I think that I either naturally release more adrenaline under certain types of pain or I am affected by the hormone more, and so instead of it acting like a pain relief I instead get a bit of a high from experiencing pain.  Of course, after enough exposure to this cause and effect, classical conditioning has got me enjoying the pain itself even before the adrenaline hits.  I'm not sure when this process started, but I can think of examples of me exhibiting either unusually high pain tolerance or enjoying a sensation that others would call painful.

Of course, once I realized it consciously I started to specifically go after it and test what kinds of pain.  Now I have pushed my boundaries of what kind of pain and what amounts I can enjoy.",1493597405

The problem I have with separating God from the equation is that I think we lose our sense of truth. I don't know if you think the same way I do, but my introspective self can define truth any way he wants, and I don't really like the way I define it. I also think truth is an important concept that has been lost on this generation. It may boil down to me wanting to believe there is right and wrong, and you believing in shades of grey, but I do think there is an innate desire for mankind to desire to do good things.

Secondly your entire argument is an [appeal to nature](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-nature) fallacy.

So all the rest of my responses are basically moot after this but I'll play...

&gt;Yes, and? That supports greater pregnancies and infants surviving to sexual maturity so they in turn can have viable offspring. 

So this, means you admit there are people in a tribe for whom reproduction may not be the ideal for the future of the family. Aunts, uncles, grandmothers, sisters, brothers, can contribute more by not reproducing, especially in hard times. . . 

&gt;Yes, they do. Elephants, great apes and lions immediately spring to mind. Most tribal species also has the concept of relatives aiding in the development and maturation of the young. Humans didn't invent grandmothers.

You cut out the context. I specifically mean grandmothers who cannot reproduce (did you read the next sentence). All elephants, all lions etc all other mammals are fertile **until they die.** They do not just have the sole role as grandmother. Only human women survive with a post-fertile period. One that they theorize evolved so that human grandmothers could solely be grandmothers (not hindered by pregnancy and small children anymore) and support the rest of the tribe.

&gt;And many women (especially in the past) were fertile until death. We've extended the human lifespan well past the age of menopause.

Yah, no. Periods and menopause are still uniquely human, and human's have lived into advanced age since the dawn of our existence.

&gt;Everything we do, both men and women, furthers the prospect of more viable offspring. That's how evolution works.

Buuut, like I said, what we are talking about is all like a useless game of checkers since you are using a fallacy in the first place.

I think the odds need to be reassessed. Here's what I propose: the bottom 3 have clearly had terroble seasons and deserve higher odds, but there should be little disparity between the three. The next two have likely had disappointing seasons, and therefore deserve a fair chance. From 6 - 10 we see a drop in odds. This is where the mediocre teams will land. They are not terrible, they are not great. They could use the help like any one else, but do not deserve it based on a tough season. This is the gray area where, if you find yourself hovering around here mid season, it does not make sense to try and tank to maintain this position. You might as well keep trucking for a playoff spot. The key here is what happens to the teams from 11 - 15. If you land here, you have just suffered a disappointing playoff push. This may hurt for the fan base, but a playoff push generates buzz and excitement and it's a whole helluva lot better than being in the bottom 3 for the entire year. Teams here should just take there 1.5% chance and just be happy that they were playing meaningful hockey in February and March.

From what everyone says (even those who can survive off streaming) wait until you know you can make enough every month (with the ability to put some money into savings in case things go under) before you go streaming full time. 

Im streaming knowing that there is only a slim chance I would ever get enough donations to survive just off streaming. Yet my reasons for streaming is to build a community of like minded viewers and streamers and not make money so I may be the last person to ask hahaha. I feel I'm successful because I've already found people to meet irl of stream and hang out with who also watch me on stream and still chat and have a good time :) 

So like what others said I would find what you're goal is and go towards that in the long run. Everyone has their own goal and what they feel is successful in the end. Good luck in your hunt!",1493597410

She is stringing you along for validation, most likely. Off-chance she is testing you to see how you will react to flakiness.

I'm currently dating a girl who did this twice before we hooked up on the 3rd date. Goes like this.

Date #1
Going to mutual friends party, you should come!

She says she would love to and will see me there. Never shows up, never texts me. I make zero attempts to reinitiate and move on figuring that's it. I do *NOT* text her that night asking where she is. She dropped the ball, I let it drop.

Date #2
Randomly about 2 weeks later, she texts me out of the blue on a Friday night.

I reply with something witty like ""oh so now you want to have fun?"" Girly emoji replies and a 'yes'. I let her know I'm headed to a dance club with some friends and she can meet me there in a couple hours. She agrees.

I expected here there by 11-12, she never shows. Again I think nothing of it and text nothing to her. I leave around 1:30 with my friends. She texts me about 2:30-3:00 saying 'sorry i'm late! where are you?'

My reply was this:

""you are late. If you can't respect my time, we can't have fun""

She apologized and we agreed to reschedule.

Date #3
She comes directly to my house. No date, no meeting out. I do not go out of my way for her. Think it was a Sunday or weekday. Chill on the back porch for a bit, have a few drinks. Take her inside. Fuck like rabbits.",1493597411

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","Bingo. This is a really important thing to understand - there's a different between right of access (which is a reasonable human right - the right to purchase goods and services) and the right to *have* said goods and services.

The idea of health care being a right is deeply flawed because it doesn't have any clear meaning. What is a ""right to health care""? What does that constitute? How many resources?

Health care is a potentially endless resource hole. You don't have the right to enslave others and you don't have the right to the resources of others, ergo a ""right to health care"" is intrinsically flawed because it necessitates violating those basic human rights.

Any right which requires resources must be very narrowly constructed to avoid these issues.

That doesn't mean that governments shouldn't provide health care. But it isn't a human right in the same way that the right to free speech is.

There are some rights which do require the government to provide things - the right to an attorney when facing criminal prosecution is one example. However, such rights are generally sharply self-limiting. This is not an endless money hole because the government is not required to prosecute anyone - they can choose to not prosecute someone, and thereby, not spend the money. Moreover, they're not required to give you a huge legal team. This avoids the ""taking other people's time/stuff"" problem - rather than being an unlimited extrinsic right, it is something which drives up the cost of prosecuting the indigent.",1493597411

I was really hoping this would basically lead to most people using smaller ships because the real ""expense"" of larger ships was getting people to crew them.

OK, if you get that head and arm and want to use it to go from standing to the ground you can't just ease down to your knees, you have to sprawl back and drop your hips. Introduce his face to the mat.

Your guard pull mas marginally better here, at least you had some control, but you did it so slow and gradual that you had to settle for halfguard instead of full.

Ok, I don't know what you were doing in halfguard, but hugging your opponent to you as you turn towards the trapped leg isn't doing you any favors. You want your hips out on the trapped like side, so you were turning the wrong way the entire time, which is why he is able to go to mount, you helped him. Then you tried to bench press him off instead of escaping correctly.

At 1:09 you are trying another flexibility based escape by pulling your foot up in front. Don't do that.  If you want to use it as part of a proper hydraulic into a leg entanglement (Once you have better leg attacks) that's one thing, but just dragging it up in front of someones hip and hoping you can peel them off is white belt shit.


Aaaand at 2:15 we learn why canopeners aren't a great idea when used against people your own size.

If you keep doing shit like you're doing at 2:40 you're going to blow your knee out eventually.

YAY! 2:50 you do a proper escape sequence! But for some reason you get 3/4 of the way through the escape and then give up and go flat again. All you had to do was shrimp again instead of going flat and you were out.

At 3:30 you have an easy trap and roll to your right, but you don't take it and you give your opponent infinite time to set up that armtriangle that you then have to defend.

See how he finishes the arm triangle with his chest flat, the pressure is in on the sides of the neck, not down. That's a much cleaner arm triangle than your early one.",1493597414

The only way to keep America out of the war and force a favorable peace would have been to launch a blown powerful enough to make American's think they couldn't win and Japan didn't have the capability to commit such an act. 

Also yes I know that saying America was uninvolved in WW2 before Pearl Harbor is not true but I was trying to look at this from the mindset of an average American at the time who probably wouldn't have seen an oil embargo or sending supplies to Britain as something that deserved military retribution.

I pretty much agree with your assesment of the titans though I would give both of their first two picks lower grades based on value.  I have not watched film on carraway but I though he fell do to lack of athleticsm (or maybe size it seemed like he was hotter pre combine) 

For the Jags I do not like fournette nearly as much though I tend to dislike running backs that early.  Disagree on Westbrook he is a shit person,  but the guy can play and it probably worth the risk in the fourth round to draft him.   I also love blair brown double no's, when he got drafted no and then no when is saw who picked him.

They are made out of cheap materials, but because of how they are put together and advertised, they are sold at the same or higher price than the gold ring. The important part is not how expensive the commodity is, but how much intellectual capital you put into it.

Imagine a pie. You cut the pie into three pieces. The first third goes to a rich person. The second third is cut into 10 pieces and given to 10 poor people, and the last third is dropped on the floor by mistake. You can either take the big piece from the rich person and give it to the poor people, or you can stop the last piece from falling on the floor and dividing that up instead. 

There is some wealth that is moved from rich to poor countries, but most of the growth in developing countries is attained by making things more efficient and not wasting as many resources (especially human intelligence.)",1493597418

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Its really not that complicated. Start with the pure minor. Its a minor mode and is fine in itself but it is more of a MODE than a scale in the post renaissance period. When functional harmony came into fashion the way to make the top 40 had to use the Major Dominant chord (and with the 7th as well  in lots of cases) because that gave them that Feeling of Finality in the cadence. So everytbing else is the  same except that (Amin) G note is raised to give you an Emaj or E7 dominant chord. And pretty much, As Peggy Lee sang ""Is that all there is?"" and yes that is really all that it is about. And it only is generally used with the V chord and not in any other context as it isn't needed except to provide that Final Full V(7) i cadence. This is easy to remember as it is named the ""HARMONIC MINOR SCALE.""

NOW we understand that it is for HARMONIC use, melody is a pretty important part of music so ""Houston, we have a problem!) When we sing a melody to this, there is often a need to sing over a Dominant chord. So in the upper tetrachord E F G A in pure the Harmonic scale would have you singing E F G# A and they did not like the augmented 2nd melodically. Oopsi! So now what? Those Prima Donna Opera singers said, NO! We are not going to sing that augmented singer. Do something! SO they raised the 6th step to eliminate the aug2nd and that was fine, the problem was solved! NO? They were still not satisfied because it was then Too major! (Make up your friggin mind!)  So they went back to the pure minor when the line was going DOWN So they sang the upper tetrachord in major going up and then went back to minor when the melody went down and they did not need the G# coming down and so everyone was finally happy. 

Well, yes and no. The composers then had to be very carefull how they wrote the accompaniments to the melodies but they worked it out (gigs were not easy if the Singing Stars were not happy) so they either voiced around it or wrotd strong enough melodies that the occasional clash of the G and G# was not noticed and everyone was happy and the Prima Donnas could take credit for stinging such a strong and commanding performance that their singing overrode any conflict and they acctually could shine more than if they did not have to ""cover"" the occasional clash. 

So there you are. The mdlodic minor was only use for meodic singing and you wrote the melodic part(s) with the minor tetrachord on the bottom and the major tetrachord on the top when ascending the scale and the pure minor when you were using the scale in a descending direction and the Harmonic G# was basically only used to make that Mamor V in the harmonic structure. 

Over the years, there has been some changes as always when composers try to be unique and interesting but that in a nutshell is all that there is to it. Today some use the Harmonic minor as a scale of its all and take the ascending form both up and down and some use the Harmonic melodically as they like the ""oriental"" flavor to the scale. Pretty much you can either use it in the original setting or each as a scale of its own and you can use it any way youo want just as any other scale. You can use the ascending or descending form of the Melodic and harmonize the minor with the major tetrachord or not. Its all open and correct how ever you use it if it turns out musically justified. You can in the melodic minor tones to build the chords if you like with either the major or minor tetrachord as the gravity of the Cycle of Fifths and functional harmony is based upon the Tonal descending fifths so the color doesn't matter. 

If you need details of specific contexts, I will try to help you sort it out but this should give you a pretty good overview of what these scales are about.

"stlouisblues","t5_2rlvj","I personally think we'll see two scratches and a couple swaps for players staying in. I think we'll see something like:

|**LW**|**C**|**RW**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:
|**Jaden Schwartz**|**Jori Lehtera**|**Vladimir Tarasenko**
|**Magnus Paajarvi**|**Paul Stastny**|**David Perron**
|**Alexander Steen**|**Patrik Berglund**|**Vladimir Sobotka**
|**Scottie Upshall**|**Kyle Brodziak**|**Dmitrij Jaskin**

Rationale for the changes:

1. Lehtera has played well with these two before, maybe it's time to rekindle the STL line.

2. I think we need to break up Bergie and Perron to get them both going. At this point I don't think it's going to matter who is taking draws because we suck at them, so mixing it up could work.

3. It's time to put PRV back in the line up. The Barbashev thing didn't really work IMO.

4. Jaskin for Reaves... I like Reaves but he and the other fourth liners really haven't done much. I like Upshall's series more than Reaves' so far so I'm putting Jaskin in for him, feeling like he can add a little more skill with his size than Reaves at this point.

I agree that Buick's success in China means Buick is going to stick around.  It seems like it should become a brand for the Chinese market though.

"confessions","t5_2qq6g","I've been where you're at. In your opinion, is your relationship salvageable? 
I would start out by talking to him and telling him exactly how and what you are feeling. 
Something that I would recommend is going to couples therapy if you want to make one last ditch effort. I did this with my ex after being together for 6 years. Everything was always turned around on me like things were all my fault, even to the point of him cheating. I learned a lot from therapy and it gave me the closure I needed. It will definitely help you make a decision whether you want to put anymore time and energy into this relationship or move on. 
You are far too young to spend anymore time with someone if they don't want the same thing.

"ucf","t5_2qh7r","Fil1000 is probably one of the easiest classes, and it also counts as a Gen Ed. The class is 3 hours long (at least when I took it) but it's 1 hour of lecture, and 2 hours of watching a movie, and we very rarely would use up all 3 hours. Out of the 14 total films watched you only had to do journals on 4 of them so you really could only go to 4 classes, although that would make the quizzes about the movies a little more difficult.

Dig3043 is the Video Games History Class. Currently have an A in it and I haven't watched any of the movies or purchased the book so that kind of sums that up. Just check in once a week with webcourses and you'll be fine. You have to do 3 Let's Plays for the class, which I found fun, but others might find tedious.

AMH (2010 and 2020) with Professor McConville is also pretty easy, but I recommend it because McConville is awesome. Makes history kind of funny, not much of a workload either. I ended up taking 2020 on top of 2010 even though I didn't have to because I seriously loved his class that much.
