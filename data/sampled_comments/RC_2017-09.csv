I could feel the goose flesh of her arm as i ran my fingers along her skin. she radiated warmth like a hearth. i drew closer to her as the deepening twilight chilled me. i was terrified and exhilarated. my heart raced and seemed to stop as her lips touched mine. she hunched her shoulders and shivered, sliding closer to me. taking my heat. she seemed to melt into me and i didn't care about anything then. we were everything. the only thing in the world.",1504224000

"gifs","t5_2qt55","He's probably talking about Ash's Charizard, which quit listening to him for some reason after it became a Charmeleon.

When the show Pokemon first aired in the United States, it was owned by UPN and only aired episodes up until Charmander evolved into Charmeleon. Over and over kids would watch, eagerly awaiting to see if this would be the time the show would move forward, because this was the first time since Butterfree that Ash had a long time pokemon of his evolve. Eventually the show was transferred to another channel and the dub continued.

And what happened? Charmeleon was a piece of shit. It was very disturbing because Charmander up until that point had been nothing but a friendly and loyal pokemon to Ash, the latter having done nothing to deserve ire. Charmeleon still didn't improve when it became a Charizard. Charizard was lazy, and never wanted to fight unless it thought the opponent was ""worthy"" of challenging, despite Charizard itself not being skilled at all. 

The worst event was when Charizard cost Ash his Indigo League match. Team Rocket had kidnapped Ash before his match, and he was forced to use his good pokemon in order to escape and reach the stadium before he was disqualified. Since Ash was not offered to reschedule his match, he was forced to compete with half a roster, and ultimately had to resort to sending Charizard out. Charizard did not give a shit, and since it would not fight Ash automatically forfeited the match. 

It wasn't until an entire season later that Charizard realized what a weak piece of shit it was after it nearly died when it got its ass kicked by a Poliwrath after Charizard kept trying to use flamethrower on it like a dumbass. It took Ash nursing it back to health for it to finally stop being such a shithead. But during the next season, they came across a valley of strong Charizards. Instead of getting his Charizard strong with his own ability, Ash left his Charizard there to ""train"" and he calls for it every now and then whenever he needs a strong pokemon to save his ass.

It didn't take literally eight seasons, but Charmander evolved at the end of episode 43 and quit being a shit during episode **107** and left Ash during episode 136.",1504224000

Roadhog is (was) a tank because he tempted you to shoot his 600+ hp instead of shooting his squishy buddies. Its 1) a lot easier to hit roadhog, 2) a lot easier to farm ult charge off Roadhog, and if you kill him, 3) you remove a huge threat and 4) it's a great way to stagger their team because of how slow he is. These are all excellent reasons for prioritizing Roadhog in a teamfight that turn Roadhog into a tank whether the player playing him wants to be one or not.

Now that he has 900 hp 300 of which has dmg mitigation, why shoot him? You can't kill him anyway, he takes a long ass time to kill you, might as well go after the enemies you *can* kill instead. That is literally the exact opposite of a tank. Oops.",1504224001

1) $35K for this truck is fucking insanity if it has airbag deployment on the Carfax.

As a general rule an accident is 10-15% off the value of a vehicle.  Airbag deployment?  30% or more.  So, for $35K I would say, yeah maybe, IF the truck was fixed well and IF it's a 2006 Crew Cab 4WD Denali.  Maybe.

That truck, if it's a Crew Cab is worth, IMO, $23-24K as a trade in with that history.

So let's start there.

Also, is this a Crew or Double cab or regular cab?

And yes, they said whatever you wanted to hear to get you in the door, that's their job.

https://www.allkpop.com/upload/2017/08/af_org/31182017/Girls-Generation.jpg


If you're playing the mobile app game 'Superstar SM' then you will know that many people in the player base were really looking forward to the new theme packs and events for Girls' Generation's 10th-anniversary. 
However, the people who were looking forward to this have been given the news that the theme packs and events have been cancelled.
On the official subreddit for the game, the developers posted, ""Event &amp; New Theme - Cancelled."" When a redditor replied, ""Event &amp; New Theme - Cancelled...for this week right? (ఠ్ఠ ˓̭ ఠ్ఠ) It will be next week?"" The developers said, ""There is nothing Dalcomsoft can do... (╥﹏╥).""




Many of the players are upset as they saved their diamonds (in-game currency for purchases) to purchase the Girls' Generation theme packs.
One player, emailed Dalcomsoft and received the following response:    I asked them if it's because of their contracts . Even they don't know if sm will allow them to update All Night Lol dear sm you really can choke . . . #SuperstarSMTown #SuperstarSM #SSM #GirlsGeneration #SNSD #TAEYEON #SUNNY #TIFFANY #HYOYEON #YURI #SOOYOUNG #YOONA #SEOHYUN #KimTaeyeon #LeeSoonKyu #StephanieHwangMiyoung #KimHyoyeon #KwonYuri #ChoiSooYoung #ImYoonA #SeoJuHyun #GIRLS6ENERAT10N #HolidayNight A post shared by #HolidayNight (@charites.ssm) on Aug 29, 2017 at 11:18pm PDT
Many of the players are wondering if SM is purposely doing this and blocking Girls' Generation due to the ongoing contract renewal situation.
What are your thoughts on the situation?

&gt;I had to dial things down and say she could put aspects on people to incline them to act one way or another, but to have FULL control over someone, she'd have to ""take them out"" in mental combat.

This is basically how [This Secrets of Cats](http://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/134533/The-Secrets-of-Cats-o-A-World-of-Adventure-for-Fate-Core) does it, and it works just fine there, so I'd say you're on the right track.

This continues until you are where you are now.

You obviously also start using Apple's software, as it's the only things that are properly supported on said Apple devices. These things can't be used on other devices, so once again you have no good option of trying something else.

It's this way with everything Apple does, and it is for a very good reason, profits. They earn massive amounts of money by funneling people to their products exclusively.

I really dislike this. Other brands want you to buy their products too, but at least you have legitimate options with Android and stuff like Windows. You aren't chained to the whole ecosystem in the same way.

But then I go back to feeling depressed.

In my life there are three different states: temporary happiness, comfortably numb and stressed. My life was a wage cuck was mostly stress with some temporary happiness sprinkled in. My life as a NEET was comfortable numbness sprinkled with temporary happiness but also feeling a lot of worry in the back of my mind about what I was going to do for money in the future (stress).

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Forgiveness can be a tough thing. To forgive does not mean to forget. It doesnt mean that you think what happened never happened. If someone apologizes for something, they have to say what they are apologizing for, what they did wrong, and take responsibility for it and be accountable for whatever harm came from it in a proportionate manner. Then they need to takes steps to ensure it doesnt happen again. Thats what an apology is and contains. Even with all that, it just means they recognize what they did that was hurtful. It doesnt mean everything is all good or that you need to take them back in a relationship. If the apology is only happening to get back what they want, a relationship with you again, its not genuine, its a transaction. 

I think you have accepted the relationship is over and are moving in other directions. No Contact needs to be in place and to stay in place. You have already been broken up three times. I know you dont want to lose something that ""could"" be great, but heres the thing, this isnt great. It never was. You have already tried and ended this relationship multiple times. There isnt some magic that will happen to make this time around great. It just wastes your time and energy.

There is nothing here that is going to make this relationship suddenly work. You have to accept what and who he is and how the relationship has already ended multiple times. There is not going to be some magical thing that happens to make this a life long story book romance of a relationship. And its time to value your time, energy and moving on is the best thing for you. Dont be convinced to come back. You have to move past this and No Contact is how you do it.  ",1504224008

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","The only time I think you should ever attempt to coach someone is if they ask for advice. I've seen lots of good advice given in game when someone asks for help on how to deal with a tracer as soldier, or how to act with a hero pick they aren't experienced with but made because it fit exceptionally well with the team comp.

However unsolicited coaching almost always just tilts the player your giving advice to. Most people do not like being told what to do, and your critique of their gameplay is going to be awful since you are also (hopefully) concentrating on your own gameplay. Your Winston might have had a very good reason for not diving their supports at that moment in the fight, and he already knows they are a priority for Winston. Trying to coach him about target priority for Winston will likely tilt him, because you are telling him he's not playing correctly... and he might not even agree with your advice.

Many players see someone giving them advice as that person telling them they are shit. By giving out unsolicited advice, you might as well be telling them they are shit, as you're having the same effect on team morale.",1504224009

Unlike others I don't seem to be seeing the distortions caused by the sharpening. 

BUT that is only for the static image.

When in motion, the sharpening introduces a lot of pixelation. It sort of looks like a poorly encoded youtube video. Screenshots won't be able to show this. I'll try get some gameplay capture of this phenomenon. My setting is at 0.25 as recommended, but I think even 0.15 works for me. Maybe it's because I play the game at a very low res (1366 x 768). All in all though, it's still a definite step up from not having this filter at all. I hope the filter can be improved, but even without any improvement, I think most people would still opt to use this filter in its current state than to put up with the blurriness of T-AA. So either way, it would be good to put it into the menu and ship it with the live Season 3 build. Improvements can even come later, after the launch of the season.

The best deck of the format is more than likely going to be hit super hard by konami so there will be a meta change which will start you on level footing with learning the format. There is only 1 playable format as the others are all casual format.

I have experience but with an added side of infertility (not related to the coagulation issue). I take baby aspirin every day and injectable blood thinners, heparin or enoxaparin, the second half of each cycle while I wait for results from the infertility procedures. A little sucky, but very manageable. It was comforting to have a reason for my losses. It's the only thing that has truly been fixable.

Edit: please don't feel at fault. There's absolutely no way to know this was an issue. It's craptastic luck. ",1504224010

Stardew Valley is just plain cute and addictive, if you look at the steam review, it's all time ""overwhelmingly positive"" which means majority of people find this enjoyable! You can also read my review [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/6s1a6x/review_stardew_valley/) (more up to date) or [here](https://www.rpgwatch.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-375.html) (outdated but easier to read with pictures).

Dragon Age: Origins is well loved by many female players cause of the story and the romance. I think the combat is quite easy as well, so pretty good for someone new to gaming too.",1504224010

You always want to be working on your closest targets first, then slowly making your way to the enemy backline. Kalista doesn't have any burst damage compared to other ADC's, so you have to take teamfights really slowly and make sure you minimize the amount of health lost by kiting tanks.

Regardless, you are the one getting a work out twisting the dials to approach an outcome you assume is correct.

I never said anything about whether you should make a bad purchase or whether bad purchases were possible in this market - I said the numbers you laid out didn't reflect the claims you made about them. They don't.

What's soft enough?  DM let me know.  

If it's soft why is it doing so much damage?  Spell says so, whether I animate a stone warrior with a sword or a glass ball the damage, A.C., and HP are determined by the spell and not the material.

What is to keep you from using wooden warriors to bluff enemies?  Dice rolls, but I could just bluff and say I have an army of Treants instead of a few floating logs.

What happens if something is destroyed before reverting?  DM let me know, but if guess it would revert to a dented/broken ball/log.

Why wouldn't the damage type change with the shape?  Spell says all things do bludgeoning damage unless DM says otherwise, regardless of shape.

1. The worst thing is the politics (which affects all financial aspects of the city and state). Everyone bitches and moans about the constantly increasing taxes, yet miraculously the same crooked politicians get elected. If they don't, they just get replaced by someone equally as crooked. Crooked politics have ruined this city and state financially.

2. Lack of diversity between neighborhoods. Yes, Chicago has just about every race and ethnicity on the planet, but everyone seems to be secluded to their own neighborhood. My neighborhood is Canaryville. It's almost all working class white here. A half mile down the road is very poor black. Two miles west is poor Hispanic. Suburbs, despite their reputation as being only white middle class, often have a mix of different races. My parents live in suburbia and their neighbors are Indian, Chinese, white, black, you name it...

3. A large chunk of the city is unlivable due to crime, poor state of homes, food deserts, and lack of  really anything besides a corner store or a liquor store.

But when giving cis men the hormones you'd give a trans woman you don't see the same effects.

He knows that he wants a gamer like Chiaki, someone who isn't super competitive and someone who likes the games he likes. As soon as he finds out that Mono and Nobe is Chiaki I think he's really going to get closer to her. He'll realise that the stuff they clash on are incredibly minor compared to how much they have in common.

Another thing I noticed is that Amano likes that game with all the blonde girls. But at the start of this episode he recommends that rainbow court game where the presumed main character has dark hair. Possible alluding to the fact that he's not just interested in hot blonde girls. BUT... the girl on the front is basically Chiaki's sister, it's the exact same, is she dressing herself based on that? If so then I could see a curve ball where Amano falls for her which would be really upsetting.

Maybe it's reading too far into it though.

It's devs editing their own game because they want to appeal to more people. No, it's not censorship, it's barely even edited. Honestly the changes are so minimal I wonder why they bothered, but whateves I never heard of this game today.

&gt; What is your opinion on anything the dev said in that forum thread?

Seems like they are trying to deal with the ""culture of fear"" created by Anti-SJWs angry at devs making decisions about their game.

&gt; The dev described these as minimal changes, do you think these minimal changes are enough to make most/all people bothered by the original designs to have no problem playing a game with the changed designs? 

No, I think they are kinda of worthless. But they are so minimal, anyone angry about it seems insane to me. Personally for these multi-character games real problem, one I can see from [this character list](http://hyperuniverse.nexon.net/en/game/hypers) for the game, is that male characters get a to be everything from monsters, to little dog men, to pretty boys while female characters are buxom/pretty girls, or a single little girl. Covering up some cleavage won't solve that issue. They need to go down the Overwatch route if they want broader appeal and add female characters with the same scope of designs the allow for male characters. ",1504224014

There I was, totally untanned from the neck down. My slightly chubby ""studies-while-eating-Doritos"" belly hanging over the waistband of my briefs. And my ""bubble butt"" as Ashley always calls it struggling to be contained.

As I ran out the door past a laughing hysterically Ashley, I was running blushing and cautiously, trying to avoid everyone, and I bumped right into a 6'1 girl who happened to be on the girl's basketball team, and I knocked her drink all over her blouse.

She looked at me angrily, then smirked.

I wonder if you could change the problem so that the power is required to make it ""unsafe"", and with out the power it reverts to ""safe"".

I am genuinely thrilled by most haunting and possession stories, but am seldom frightened by creatures or monsters - with a few notable exceptions. I also like slow horror that stems from human behaviour, including serial killer stories and some cult stories. Gore and torture porn do little for me and as far as I am concerned, nothing is lower than the jump scare.

It's not a ""weird"" law.  Similar laws exist elsewhere.

So like I said in my original post, it's illegal for the employer to benefit from the internship.  Directly asking in interview what was in it for them was inappropriate.  Though it was a useful red flag for me.

"SampleSize","t5_2tlqg","&gt; with unclear questions like this in all the answers from trans people have to essentially be discarded as we can't be sure we mean the same thing when we answer the same thing.

To be honest, part of the reason I'm not adding more clarification is that I don't use the results from this question for trans people, especially not transitioned trans people, since in that case it's rather obvious how people feel. For non-transitioned trans people, it can help figure out how ""serious"" of a case we're talking about, but among non-transitioned trans people the clarification isn't necessary as both interpretations yield the same result.

I'm still using the rest of the trans answers, but not so much this question.

2. The mainnet is where smart contracts can be deployed by developers. Currently, there is a testnet where test tokens can be used to interact with the blockchain. 
3. When the mainnet launches, Qtum will be its own blockchain (not running on top of ethereum). The network is not congested. 
4. That's up to the Qtum team's marketing strategy and development roadmap. 
5. Qtum will be traded on more and more exchanges, not less and less. Not sure about Bithumb. 
6. Be on the lookout for Qtum wallets. I haven't done much research here. 
7. Ethereum has not been ""hacked"", but bad smart contracts have been exploited. This is not, and should not, be up to the Ethereum foundation or Qtum. People need to do their own due diligence with where they choose to put their money.
8. Qtum will likely have an alliance similar to the EEA.
9. They're not worried about ""a crackdown"". China is one of the most forward thinking countries when it comes to investments. Qtum, some companies will most definitely be using Qtum to raise funds using the ICO mechanism. Some have already started.
10. Not sure you're ready to run an ICO based on these questions, to be honest. Companies will choose Qtum if they believe in the strength of the platform and have a positive outlook on its future. 
11. Qtum differentiates itself by incorporating aspects of two successful blockchains (Ethereum's EVM and Bitcoin's UTXO model) together. This allows Qtum to build SPV wallets that can run on mobile devices.
12. I have no clue but I expect this place to grow over time.

No such point, not even an allusion or hint, is made that Jon *can't die.* And that's good because if he couldn't die without committing suicide or something, the whole thing would be cheap and pointless. All the supposed peril he has been in would be for nought. Even resurrection is risky on that front.

But no, it's not implied that Jon can't die through normal means such as sinking like a stone in heavy clothes and armour in near-freezing water.

Basically, if you decide to use an action and a bonus action in the same round, you roll both and decide which to resolve first. The second is added to the first count. E.g. An assassin rogue wants to go daggers free with TWF. They roll 4(1d4) to Attack, and 5(1d6) for a bonus action.

Because they fundamentally are able to improve the economy. Now imagine what would happen if the only requirement to enter this country was a background check and enough money to sustain yourself?

No, actually just the mysterious figure in general.

fuck that motherfucking superboss to the highest and lowest pits of the darkest depths of the most infernal forms of hell. fuck him, fuck him and everything he stands for. that fucking boss is such a salt mine it isn't even remotely funny.

To even UNLOCK this asshole, you have to beat vanitas's lingering sentiment

AND HE'S ALMOST AS HARD!! at least he has a predictable pattern, MF is just straight up bullshit. he recovers from ALL of his attacks based on how many times you hit him, but he doesn't just recover, sometimes he'll be in the MIDDLE of another attack!!! so expect to punish a whiffed lightsaber only to have him behind you just finishing a flare cast...JUST FINISHING A FLARE CAST, AS IN HE'S LITERALLY TELEPORTED BEHIND YOU AND SKIPPED 90 PERCENT OF HIS FLARE CAST ANIMATION AND IS JUST ABOUT TO UNLEASH IT, GIVING YOU MAYBE A TENTH OF A SECOND TO RECOGNIZE THIS AND RESPOND ACCORDINGLY!!! then if you try TOO HARD, HE COMBINES HIS ALREADY IMPOSSIBLE TO AVOID BULLSHIT!! YOU THOUGHT HIM GOING INVISIBLE WAS BAD? HOW ABOUT GOING INVISIBLE, CASTING IMPALEMENT SPIKE MAGIC ORBS, AND RUNNING AT YOU COVERED IN FIRE WHILE REGULARLY CASTING FLARE AND TORNADO?!?! YEAH, IF YOU OVERLEVEL TO BEAT HIM ""EASY"" HE AUTOMATICALLY TURNS UP THE DIFFICULTY BEFORE THE SECOND HALF OF THE FIGHT JUST BECAUSE HE CAN!! WORSE, SOMETIMES YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE TO BE OVERLEVELED!! JUST BRINGING THE WRONG DECK COMMANDS CAN TRIGGER HIS ""WELL FUCK YOU TOO!!"" MODE AND HE'LL JUST USE EVERYTHING!! like...at least the fight's addictive because it ends so fast...but you'd better be ready for some serious bullshit with this boss.

two years, it took me two years of stubbornly refusing to use thunder blitz as terra before i beat him.

TWO YEARS OF TRYING TO FIGHT THIS FUCKER NORMALLY AS TERRA  BEFORE I CAVED AND USED THUNDER BLITZ, BUT THE THING IS, EVEN THEN HE CAN FUCK YOUR SHIT UP!!!

so in summation

fuck that boss. fun as hell to fight, but honestly the most evil optional superboss in gaming, he's right up there with parace l'sia and queen larsa in terms of difficulty. fuck that fucking boss to high hell FUCK THAT GODDAMNED B-",1504224026

Then you should dip rather extensively into early Medieval. You may skip the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. That is mostly dangerous propaganda. Now that I think of it, you had better skip the Romantics and the Victorians, too. For the contemporary period, you should study some selected comic books.

You have to keep in mind that you're comparing Lucian to midlaners rather than ADCs now. It fucks up his power curve a lot.

ADCs usually have decent early levels since autoattacks are the main source of damage.

After maybe one item, mages start spiking. Mages are usually quite strong in skirmishes, while ADCs become stronger late game.

2. Identify your Y factors

   y and y

3. Create your factor pairs

  (5x  y) (x  y)

4. Test out signs in the middle to see what you need to get the middle term

Sorta like a combination of Zenyatta and Zarya; This hero can put temporary 'bubbles' on allies. These bubbles would slightly reduce gravity for the hero, increase movement speed by like 10%, and would purify+make the hero temporarily immune to most CC.

This hero could also put these bubbles on enemies, which would cause the enemy to become almost *entirely* immune to gravity (maintaining their current momentum), while making them unable to walk nor use most mobility abilities, and temporarily preventing the enemy from being healed. So this could either be used to cause a fast-moving enemy to just uncontrollably *float away* into the distance, or to simply make a slower enemy float casually up into the air to be an easy target for allies.

I think a hero that plays with gravity could be a lot of fun, and this would add an additional character capable of both purifying and blocking heals.",1504224028

The latter form of apostasy however is a crime that is equated to treason to state and the ummah (all Muslims) and civil disobedience. Even today and in many Western nations, one of the punishments for treason is death. Similarly though, in classical Islamic jurisprudence, such severe punishments (hudd) are rarely given and are reserved for the worst of the worst. Minor apostasy has no punishment in courts as it is a personal issue between the individual and his Lord, after all, [there is no compulsion in religion.](https://quran.com/109)

I think that is a 'colloquialism"", and it certainly wont work with NK because of one simple reason:

NK only wants the bare minimum to survive, while USSR was challenging US for world supremacy.

Great news: Content Drop 1 is here!And with it, Aven Colony is getting 11 new  buildings, a new sandbox map  ...  and a whole new transportation system!This update brings a brand new transportation system to Aven Colony: hovercars!The new Hovercar Station building automatically links to any other Hovercar Stations you build nearby.  Now, you can not only solve your colonists' commute problems, but you can do it in style, by giving them swanky levitating hovercar vehicles to fly all around the colony!(See our Twitter announcement and follow-up for full-size screenshots)Content Drop 1 also brings a massive new Space Elevator.While quite expensive, this elevator provides a literal stairway to heaven, connecting your colony all the way to outer space using a massive carbon nanotube cable.  The  elevator that rides it massively increases your colony's storage capacity while also docking directly with the orbiting Colony Ship to allow you to bring in large numbers of new colonists.There's also a new tool to help your colony deal with plague spores: the  Decontamination Unit!  Just place one of these next to one or more tunnel tiles, and it will serve as a firewall, spraying a decontamination liquid that kills plague spore  microbes and disinfects any infected colonists.On top of all that, there are 8 new decoration buildings that help you make your colony even more beautiful while also improving morale.Finally, this update also brings a brand new sandbox map: Serpent Isle!  This is a  beautiful desert island in the middle of Aven Prime's great northern sea, and is a uniquely challenging colony location due to its relatively low levels of geothermal vents and farmable cropland.  Look closely and you can spot a number of creatures unique to this remote part of Aven Prime.We also have a number of tuning tweaks and optimizations in this update.As a quick note: please bear in mind that we have much more in store for Aven Colony.As we go forward, we want to make sure that we focus our development on new maps, new  buildings, and new gameplay modes that add as much value as possible.  It should be clear from the new features listed above that everything we've added fills a gameplay hole or otherwise addresses key gameplay issues while also giving you tools to make your colonies look even cooler.We have a BIG long-term vision for what Aven Colony can be, and we need your help to get it  there.  We are laser-focused on making sure that every new feature we add makes the game more fun, makes your colonies more beautiful, gives you more tools as a colony  governor, and gets Aven Colony that much closer to where we see it in the future.Here are the detailed descriptions for each new building and the full list of new features:Hovercar StationsHovercar Stations allow rapid transit around the colony  using levitating 1-passenger vehicles.  A small number of Hovercar Stations can  quickly integrate a large colony and allow you to safely place residential and work  sites a good distance away from one another.Each Hovercar Station can connect to up to 5 other Hovercar Stations around the  colony, and colonists will use them to dramatically shorten their commute.  Hovercar  Stations also allow service buildings such as Retail Centers, VR Centers, and  Hospitals to dramatically extend their range around the colony.  Hovercars prefer to  move over tunnels but can also move over empty areas, and can even support  transporting colonists between completely disconnected parts of the colony.  They can  even travel over rivers and crater lakes.Hovercar stations not only help you address Commute morale and keep residential  structures separate from work sites, they also give a Commute morale bonus to the  surrounding area.Space ElevatorA Space Elevator is an enormous support structure for a  carbon-nanotube-based wire that extends all the way up into orbit, close to the  orbiting colony ship.  Its massive size dwarfs all other colony structures, and it  features an elevator that will gradually climb the giant cable all the way into space.   Although a Space Elevator is very expensive and time-consuming to construct, it  dramatically increases a colony's storage capacity and also supports immigration and  emigration with higher capacity per trip than an Immigration Center.Decontamination UnitThe Decontamination Unit is very useful for preventing  the spread of the plague and plague spore microbes around the colony.  It will  automatically detect plague spore microbes and plague-infected colonists, and will  quickly lower arms into up to 4 adjacent tunnels, spraying a special disinfectant  spray that can cure colonists and destroy plague spore microbes that move past.  This  allows it to act as a very effective ""firewall"" if placed at key locations around the  colony.DecorationsA new set of 8 ""Decorations"" is available, including 4 enclosed  ""atrium"" buildings that connect like tunnels, and 4 freestanding outdoor buildings that do not connect to the colony and do not consume power or allow colonists to walk through.  These include  fountains, obelisks, crystals, mini-parks, and more.Serpent IsleSerpent Isle is a brand new sandbox map.  It is a desert  island in the middle of Aven Prime's great northern sea.  Its strategic location and  its abundant metal and Zorium deposits make it worth colonizing; however, geothermal  vents are scarce, and due to its sandy soil, the island has relatively few areas that  are amenable to crop cultivation.Additional ChangesSignificantly modified temporal antialiasing to cause much less blurring,  especially when close to buildingsLots of optimizations that should significantly reduce the amount of hitching with  large colonies and improve large-colony performance overallAdded a new ""Decorations"" submenu and moved the Park into this submenu (from  ""Services"")The ""Spaceports"" menu has been renamed to ""Ships &amp; Vehicles,"" and includes the new  Hovercar StationMade Vanaar and Sandy Gulch in the campaign slightly more difficult (this does not  affect saved games, only new games on those maps)Improved the look of the Employment overlay: now shows green arrows in most cases,  or red if a worker's commute is causing a morale penalty.  Also dramatically improved  the look of this overlay.  It also shows connections between hovercar garages in  purple if any colonists use them in a commute.Improved the Commute overlay: this now also shows the red lines from the Employment  overlayImproved the effect when you recycle a Prometheus LanderSending an expedition out to investigate a distress signal which later turns out to  be rebels no longer leaves you with ""{0}"" and ""{1}"" in the nextCrowding morale should now be a slightly more serious problem at most difficulty  settings -- but MUCH easier to addresss using hovercars!The Morale graphs in the Statistics panel were 50% too small; they are now the  proper sizeThe Bar &amp; Grill now has a smaller morale effect in general and properly reduces the  morale effect further at tier 1The Earth History Center is now more expensive and has a reduced morale effectThe Park is now slightly more expensive to buildThe VR Center's morale effect has been reduced slightlyHabitats and Skyscrapers now use slightly less power and a Tier-2 Skyscraper is  slightly more expensiveLaser mines now use less power and no longer reduce air quality as much as they did  previouslyFixed an issue where holding Ctrl to highlight buildings while dragging a building  for placement could cause buildings to temporarily disappear when you released CtrlCreeps &amp; tentacles now vanish properly the moment a building begins its destruction  sequenceAdded more specialized POI marker types for expeditions: rebels, splinter groups,  creep nests, and plague nestsFixed a rare stability issueWe hope you enjoy all the new features.Finally, THANK YOU once again for being part of the Aven Colony community.  Let us know your thoughts on all the new features in the forums!Also, a final note for those of you playing on console.  We're in regular content with the console team at Team17 to make sure these changes do make it over to Xbox One and PlayStation 4.  It may take a few weeks for all these changes to make the transition but rest assured we're pushing as hard as we can on this front.Thank you, and we're looking forward to getting you even more big improvements in Content Drop 2!Paul Tozour and the Mothership Entertainment team

"Android","t5_2qlqh","1. For tablets, sure. For regular phones? Very small use case. I've worked in several huge offices, one a Fortune 500 company, and have never seen someone use an external keyboard for their regular phone (not their tablets). 
2. Before physical keyboards were removed people would use their thumbs to strike the lower half of their phone. After they were removed, people used their thumbs to strike the lower half of their phone. Nothing actually changed. I had multiple Blackberrys and a Palm Pre before switching and minor quirks aside it was the same. Without a headphone jack I can no longer use most of my audio devices with my phone. That's a huge break in compatibility. 
3. Unless battery life is perpetual it'll always be an issue. More devices to charge is a bad thing. 
4. Every car I've ever hooked a Bluetooth up to sounds horrible without an aux cable, and that's only 320 kbps. It's a huge difference. BMWs, Hyundais, Toyotas, and Nissan. Yes, I've had to rent quite a few cars and I got in the habit of bringing an aux cable.
5. Barring a decent replacement with all the upsides of auxiliary cables and none of the downsides of Bluetooth, I don't see why it can't stay for the long term. The better question is, why get rid of something so damn useful that benefits everyone and has virtually no cons? I've heard no compelling reasons aside from ""it's old"" and ""it might get dust inside once a year."" It's wireless, but that comes with a whole slew of other problems. 
6. Yes, I meant transmission. This has DRM written all over it, same as HDMI. Before we know it we'll only be able to sync with authorized devices. It's not like this is without precedent. ",1504224033

Here's an old land use map of America. Many areas have gotten considerably more developed since it was published but I'm posting it because it's easy to understand: http://images.nationmaster.com/images/motw/national_atlas_1970/ca000113.jpg (notice how much land is used by people or livestock)

We also now have ""empty"" land being desecrated by so-called green energy projects like wind turbines and huge solar arrays, with a lot more of that planned in a vain effort to replace dense energy like oil.  Fracking is spreading into areas previously un-drilled. There's overpopulation of ugly machines all over the place in addition to the people who demand their energy. 

People usually congregate and build cities near major water supplies, though modern people have broken that rule with sprawling desert cities that shouldn't exist, e.g. Vegas and Phoenix. All modern cities would fail in a matter of days or weeks if they could only draw resources from within their physical boundaries.",1504224033

&gt; Personal anecdote, I produce shit I find completely worthless, and yet somebody pays me money to do it, which I find to be very valuable indeed.

The capitalist doesn't have an interest in using the stuff you produce either. The value he sees in it is through its exchange, which is basically the same value you see in it, its value is in its exchange.

That's your processor next to a new Ryzen 3. It has fewer cores and slightly slower clock speed, but is overall a much better processor. In the years since the Phenom II series has come out, CPUs have become more efficient meaning that even if the clock speed is roughly the same, the newer CPUs are (most of the time) going to be better.

It all just depends on what your budget is for upgrading. I mentioned the motherboard because unfortunately, if you upgrade your CPU, you'll have to upgrade your mobo as well. Your CPU uses the AM3 socket which is not supported anymore.",1504224040

There also seemed to be an effort to find a way to make the portal gun work on something less difficult and expensive to synthesize than gel made from moon dust. I'm assuming they cracked that nut at some point and were able to make portal-sensitive materials using artificial moon dust (either that, or a little of it goes a *long* way).

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","&gt;But if men were negotiating more often and more aggressively, we would expect the pay gap to be larger in years of high competition for the company (when profits are low, so bargaining power (skills, frequency, threat of leaving, etc) are the most valuable). They find the opposite to be true.

I wouldn't have expected that to be true. Wouldn't negotiation to be less effective under these conditions as the company isn't in a position to increase wages?

&gt;That's one of their other interesting findings: ""* we estimate that women are paid 15.7 to 16.9 percent less than men relative to their marginal product, and older workers 41.5 to 51.6 percent more than prime-aged workers relative to their marginal product*""

Cool, then I like that finding, it's a shame the media didn't use that as their headline. As to the female, male productivity gap. So if experience is then shown to account for a much larger gap than gender, and we know that gender is a factor in experience (time taken off, higher engagement is part-time work), then perhaps this is nothing to do with gender at all, and everything to do with previous work being overvalued? Now that I could get in board with, as I've always been of the mind that previous experience is overvalued. That really does make total sense too, as pervious pay levels are almost always your anchor points for future pay levels.

&gt;If that's beneficial to the firm, in terms of increasing their output, then it would show up in productivity.

I'll have to check their metrics for productivity

&gt;I think we have to agree to disagree on this one. I think I've made it pretty clear why this top-down approach to measuring productivity is better.

And I think I've made pretty clear why I think it's inadequate.

&gt;The productivity metric is the crux of the whole paper, measured as output divided by labour supply. Seems fine to me.
Skill is measured by ANZIOC occupation codes, and they build the model at the 1-digit, 2-digit and 3-digit levels. These are described on pages 28-32. Seems reasonable.

I'll look into it.

Throughout our discussions I hope I haven't been unpleasant, especially as my OP was quite accusatory. You've been very well mannered, as well as being well informed about the source material.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","&gt; Literally every game company software business on the planet releases bugs. Period. Also, increasing the number of people on a problem often doesn't solve it faster, and being a successful business doesn't always translate to the ability to hire good talent. 

While every software of size usually has bugs still in it upon release, there is a very big difference when talking about games in general.  This includes ESO very much.  Bugs not found in testing and auditing usually require odd circumstance or compilation of circumstance not usual.  ESO has pushed bugs live, found immediately, using them exactly as intended.  Usually means lack of batch testing to see if expected results are returned.  Basic procedure in game testing.

While adding more coders to a problem does not always fix things, if you lack people to do it, you need to hire some to do it.  Same can be said for fixing known bugs.  If a team is tasked with fixing a bug and doesn't, there is an expected issue.  You lack enough people to task to it because it keeps getting pushed lower in priority  or you lack people capable of fixing it in a timely manner.  You address those issues well before a bug lives on live for years.

I expect bugs with a new piece of code.  Though, I don't expect to find them from doing intended things in intended ways that should have been tested.  And, I expect bugs reported years ago to get fixed instead of continually buried because of poor coding procedures, repeated mistakes, or poor testing leaving higher priority bugs on live constantly.

&gt; That said, I have literally no idea who you're talking about that is somehow taking pride in their ability to ignore them.

There are a lot of people on this forum that down vote discussions of bugs and issues in this game with no thought input, opinion, counter, etc.  I've had people in game tell me to ""Relax.  It's just a game!"" after someone repeatedly used broken mechanics, exploited bugs, or old items not updated and still in game to kill us in PvP.  Yes, people are really that dismissive and ZOS has a bad history on fixing these issues and exploits in a timely manner.

And, of course, the whole console launch every DLC that leaves bugs already known and fixed on PC to linger for a month to month and a half after console launch.  I have often suggested, they delay console launch by two weeks.  Apply patches they already did to PC, send it to certification, and then launching it after that 2 weeks.  Better quality launch 1 month later vs buggy launch 2 weeks later than plays with lots of bugs for a month to month and a half.  Which, on several of the bugs, falls back to their testing procedures.  I've also gone into performance on console when it has a single known hardware profile.  But, that would require recoding the clients to make use of multi core cpus better.  Which, they won't do.  Yes, console APU setup is not good for gaming.  But, they launched it and maintain it on console.  Making money from it.  So, there is an obligation to improve.  Which, would also increase PC performance as well.  Though, they started client side authority on PC and hacked it up to prevent some of the cheating instead of a proper rewrite.",1504224045

According to the lore their armour moves in sync with them like a second skin, especially so due to the black carapace providing a strong neural and nervous connection. This means the armour moves like their own limbs, at the same speed they do.

The only way they could apply their own strength is if they somehow moved their own limbs faster than the power armour moved, which they can't, especially when linked because it anticipates their movements. They would *also* have to be pushing harder than the push-back of the motors. It would be like trying to push a car that is moving at the same speed as you. You wouldn't actually be pushing it, you would just be moving forwards with your hand touching it. Then if you sped up, the car is stronger so you would just have to bend your arm because you aren't stronger than the motor.

In short, for them to be able to apply bodily force from inside power armour, the armour would have to be slower and weaker than them and thus be a detriment.",1504224050

My child did many things that are similar to your child and simply placing him in a more structured program (a few hours, a few times per week) where he was exposed to other kids a lot worked wonders for his language skills. 

As someone else said formal diagnostic tools for children that young are pretty few and far between. The closest one that we use a lot in the u.s. is the preschool language scale 5th edition or the PLS 5... but even at that age it's still based quite a bit on parent input and sometimes observations. When we do observations and play we're looking often times for specific things.

If you feel like he needs another evaluation I would absolutely ask for one. If you were thinking autism spectrum disorder you might try and reach out and find someone who is very knowledgeable about that area or a clinic that specializes.

You might consider asking for a full evaluation in the area of autism. What that typically looks like as observations and play as well as some standardized measures and checklists. One of the major standardized measure in the area of autism is something called the autism diagnostic observation system. When they administer the ADOS they set up very specific play schemes for the children and watch for specific behaviors.

Can I also add that there's no rush, take time and plan the proposal. I was never big into proposals or weddings - to me, in my heart, I was already married to her... so I often thought 'what are we waiting for?'. But she always said I would know when it was the 'right time'. The right time was 4 years in, 1 year living together, and just a regular day, and I'm so very thankful I didn't rush any of it!

On to the proposal - my wife had made clear that she wanted to be proposed to and wanted a grand story to tell! But I also knew she hates attention, hates fuss and realistically wanted it to be just the two of us. So one morning I had a fancy car pick us up and take us to an incredible restaurant, and then a very high-end hotel - as expensive as I could find! It was an honestly incredible day, and worth every $$$$.

She says now that she was not expecting a proposal, but we do joke because we watched another couple get engaged at the restaurant, and she told me (as we applauded their engagement) that if I ever did that she would murder me - which with my plans it was hard keeping a straight face and a calm heart!

Anyway, the next morning as we were snuggled up in the biggest and comfiest bed that exists in this world (I swear), I asked if she wanted to watch a video. I had prepared an elaborate cheesy video montage of our love story, ending with a big question mark as to what could be the next chapter...?
So ring, tears, proposal, many more tears....then breakfast! Oh, and on the way home she insisted that we stop and buy a gorgeous ring for me (more tears).

10/10 - would propose to her again!

Why do people glorify 6 figures so much, especially for jobs that require little college and no hands-on experience? I think it's kinda stupid to want a job like that. I hear stories how people who hate engineering go through college because ""that's where the jobs are at."" What jobs? A stable 6-figure job? Whatever, good for you. I rather get a job doing something I love than working at a 6-figure one. I definitely wouldn't want to work for an oil rig either. Those companies are shady. 

Why do I want to reinvent the wheel? Firstly, I don't want money, but I do want to change the world and make my mark in it. And to do that, I need capital, but that isn't the same as wanting money. My passion drives my profit, not the reverse. As for reinventing the wheel, if I immerse myself in the field I want to thrive in, like economics, I'll acquire more knowledge in it, like how it works, and I'll be able to make smarter decisions. 

As for that McMahon guy, idk what point you're trying to make with him. Wikipedia says he's CEO of WWE. That's pretty impressive. 

As for risk, I've been thinking how risk can be replaced with research in the market you want to start your business in. If you have a legitimate service entirely in its own market, not some stupid pizza parlor but like the creation of a new technology, 10 times better than anyone else's service assuming there even are competitors, and you have a strong team of passionate people, and a strategic business model, I don't think there's any risk. You study the market to its finest details, and then you go for it with all your might. 

I'm okay with anything I must sacrifice to achieve my goal. If that means I gotta put in 70-80 hour work weeks, so be it. As for the family thing, there are many examples of career people with stable families. Gwyneth Shotwell, president of SpaceX, is an inspiration of mine. 

Is it worth sacrificing my youth for a chance at running a successful start-up? I think it is. What else would I be doing in my 20s? Smoking pot or going to the movies? Okay, cool. I rather be the owner or executive of an aerospace company in my 40s than do that in my 20s. And I don't care about being ""uber rich"" either. I want to help the world to the best of my abilities, and I believe the privatization of space and the colonization of Mars is the most efficient way at doing that. And on top of that, I'll have a stable family too. 

I think I'm starting to see our dissent, and please correct me if I'm wrong. I believe you think there's some actual roll of the dice in trying to start a business, or going for an occupation that's deemed financially risky by society. And that probability exists regardless of your decisions or actions. I don't think there's any roll of the dice, it's all cause-and effect. And that cause-and-effect can be studied intensely so you can correctly predict the future. Basically, it's all based on you alone. If you fail, you didn't prepare for something correctly or maybe you didn't try hard enough, you didn't predict correctly. But that isn't stopping you from trying again. There's no risk, there is only cause-and-effect. 

TL;DR: I'll be real here. I get there's a future where I don't achieve what I want, but at least I'll wash up with tons of experience, connections, and knowledge. And from that, I can land a sweet 6-figure job too in the aerospace industry. But I refuse to acknowledge this future. As long as I stay stubborn and persevere, I'm sending a message to myself that I refuse to acknowledge a future where I give up.",1504224057

The entire interpreter state is copied whenever you create a new thread, which can lead to unexpected oddities depending what happens to be loaded at that time. In contrast, forking on a unix-like operating system is Copy on Write, which means that memory is only copied when changes are made; this is a key part of the efficiency of forking.

My suggestion for an option to run ""embarassingly parallel"" tasks you can encapsulate in a subroutine is [IO::Async::Function](https://metacpan.org/pod/IO::Async::Function). It abstracts all of the process creation and communication away, and indeed, on Windows it even uses interpreter threads behind the scenes (as forking is not really a better option there).

However, the United States can be reimbursed for the cost of the wall by Mexico in a variety of ways, as outlined by President Trump (remittance payments tax, security tolls, reduction in annual foreign aid, etc).  So Mexico is going to pay for it, no question, but not via a one time big novelty check handed over to the president... don't be silly.

This effectively puts Mexico on a payment plan for a wall that of course they don't want.   But the Mexican economy is desperately reliant on the United States, whereas the United States economy dwarfs Mexico.   Its similar to the negotiating power that Walmart had with the record industry.   Everyone laughed at the idea that one store could set prices for an entire industry, but Walmart pointed out that about 50% of the industries CD sales were through Walmart, yet CD sales only accounted for 1.5% of Walmart's total revenue, meaning Walmart could simply stop selling CDs if they didn't agree to Walmart's price demand... and of course they caved.     The US is not just a military but economic juggernaut, and Mexico has no control or choice in the matter but to pay for the wall.",1504224064

id agree with you if we were talking about regular sports. because you can understand the game super well and just not be athletic enough to be good at it, somebody that understands it less that is athletic would win out if it was football/soccer or other traditional sports. 

in esports about 90% of the game is mental, the other 10% is really just mechanics. if you understand the game really well you should almost always be able to rank up to the rank your decision making is at. you could just play lucio or genji or a hero that doesnt take good aim if you have bad aim, if your decision making is master level lets say, you can probably get master just off of that lol

&gt; 1 : a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race

Well, we don't know what this officer (or anyone who tells offensive jokes) thinks about any race.  I'm white.  If I say that the Winter Olympics were only invented to give white people the chance to win at sports, that doesn't make me a racist against my own race.  It just means I have an off color sense of humor.

So it can't be this one.

&gt; 2a :  a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles

&gt; 2b :  a political or social system founded on racism

Well, this guy certainly isn't running an entire political system.

So it can't be this one either.

&gt; 3 :  racial prejudice or discrimination

Is someone in this situation getting unequal treatment compared to another?  No?

Welp, can't be this one either then.

Actually, when it comes to racial supermounts, the Elves get shafted. their Pegasus's primary attack is just as useless as the unicorn one, and they cant carry at all.


Resource wise, Dwarves get a MUCH more reliable and easy to reach source of plentiful darkstone than elves do imo, aswell as lightstone is moderately easy to reach. Dwarves are also much closer to the nidhogg spawn area, making these excellent flyer mounts easier to obtain for them than anyone else. 

They also happen to be closer to both the snow zone and dragon island than anybody, giving them relatively easy access to both ice imps (best fridges in game) and infernus dragons (which once they get their fire breath back will be top tier again)",1504224069

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","So you recently yourself was eating 1620 and lifting, so you know how hard that is.  It's even more hard for your friend who is eating at very low calorie.  

The deeper his caloric deficit, the more the body turns to lean tissues like muscles and organs to make up for the deficit.   Bad scene - his hair is falling out is a sign of shock.  It can also mean that his heart isn't beating normally and that his organs are being damaged by too much deficit.  

Next stop needs to be a doctor.  

Tell me if we're talking about you, /u/Mody216, okay?  

Can he make muscle gains on a deficit?   No, not on a huge deficit like that.   On a slighter deficit where he's getting enough nutrients and protein, he can slowly make gains and also lose weight.  But take one or the other to an unsafe extreme, neither will work well nor for very long.

Put it like this:  How many police, or people in general, do you hear joking about molesting babies?  Killing grandmothers?  Blowing up churches?   They don't because it would be seen as taboo by their peers. Saying something like this so casually gives me a small glimpse into the conversations this ""officer"" had with many other cops, and that black people getting killed is literally a light matter for them. 

Even worse, if you know anything about Atlanta- Cobb county is literally know for profiling, harassing, and arresting people for BS  (Remember the [cop that was arresting people based on suspicion they had used weed?

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I also love the Elta MD UV Clear!  It took a little experimenting for me to love it - when I used it on top of my morning moisturizer (Cerave PM), it would pill pretty badly.   So now, I either go without moisturizer, or I discovered that I can use a different moisturizer that's got a silicone pretty high up the list (Dermalogica Active Moist) under it and it's fine, no pilling.  I'm naturally oily, so the Elta works pretty good as a moisturizer on its own.   I love that it has what, like 5% niacinamide??  I think my skin loves the niacinamide, because I've been getting great results from Paula's Choice niacinamide booster (I use it at night).   

I've actually never tried an Asian sunscreen - before I switched to Elta, I was using Neutrogena &amp; Cetaphil sunscreens.  If I want to be fancy, I use Paula's Choice RESIST Super-Light Wrinkle Defense SPF 30 - I don't ever wear foundation, but the tint on that sunscreen is perfect for me, so it provides a lot of cover.  I also like that's a 100% physical sunscreen (Zinc Oxide 13%).

I used to HATE putting on sunscreen because it was so greasy and left me feeling like an oil slick.   Getting one that you actually enjoy wearing makes all the difference - if you hate using it, chances are you will not wear it every day :)   

I swear the Elta MD has contributed to my face looking more even-toned - it is so NOT greasy or shiny, it absorbs well (if it pills on you, you'll just have to experiment or go without a moisturizer underneath).  ",1504224071

To elaborate...

Like /u/BearbertDondarrion says, the first thirteen episodes cover the first four light novels. The 1930 timeline comes from #1, the Flying Pussyfoot (Dec 1931) timeline comes from #2-3, and the Dec 1931/Jan 1932 timeline is supposed to be #4...

...Except the anime completely alters the 1932 timeline to the point where it is almost a butchery of it. Parts of it echo *parts* of #4, but there are so many differences. The 1930 timeline in the anime also differs in that it condenses the events of two days and one night to one day and one night, resulting it having to change a lot of sequences and switch around other things.

All three timelines also cut characters, etc. The point is, you have to start from the beginning if you get into the light novels if you don't want to be confused. So much is changed, really. (I've been planning a guide to the differences between the anime and source material for ages now).

Oh, the anime also borrows from LN#5 quite a bit. And the OVAs (eps 14-16) are connected with LN#14. 

Llama, you might want to check out /r/Baccano (we have a FAQ and wiki there that might interest you) to learn more. Also, feel free to ask me any questions about the light novels/anything about Baccano! and the Naritaverse.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","I wave goodbye to Carol as I open the door to my car.  She always follows me halfway to the end of her lawn telling me different news items and tidbits about her children and grandchildren.  She’s a sweet lady and I really wish I could stay just ten or twenty minutes longer and give her some more company but I have so many people to visit.  I always feel bad like I’m trying to escape from her when all she wants is someone to talk to.

I turn the key and my engine sputters to life.  I turn to Carol who is still watching me with a sad smile on her face.  My heart breaks a little as she raises her hand and we wave for the fourth or fifth time.  I start to drive forward as I don’t want to prolong this much longer.

This job is okay as far as jobs go.  All my clients, I guess you could call them that, they are all great people and it feels good delivering food to them and chatting with them even if it’s for a small bit.  Most times though I just wish I didn’t have to be in such a rush.  Maybe I should come and visit Carol on one of my days off.

Next on my list is old man Wilkins.  He used to be my neighbor when I was young.  I used to mow his lawn and shovel his sidewalks for comic book and video game money.

I guess he had a really rough time after his wife Jeannie died because he sold his house and moved into his current tiny apartment.  She was a real treasure, his Jeannie.  She was hands down the nicest person I have ever met.

Maybe that was why it was so hard to bring him his food.  It was really painful to think of losing a loved one, especially someone like Jeannie.  But what also made it tough was that he kept calling me death and trying to hide from me each time.  I literally have no idea where he got that from.  He was kind of a goofy guy even before Jeannie died.

I stop my car outside his apartment complex and grab his meal box from the back seat.  I walk up to his apartment door with his food under one arm while I use the other to knock.  “Mr. Wilkins!  It’s me, Bradley.  I got steak and mashed potatoes for ya.  I know that’s your favorite.”

“It’s unlocked”, yells Mr. Wilkins from somewhere inside his apartment.

I open the door to his apartment and almost drop the meal box when I see Mr. Wilkins standing beside his kitchen counter dressed in a dark grey suit as if he was going to a fancy party.  He usually wore baggy sweat pants and a white shirt. 

I say, “You’re dressed well.  You don’t have to get all fancy for me.”  I try lightening the mood.  It usually worked with him but sometimes he would still try to run away calling me death and saying things like ‘you’re not getting me today!’

“It’s okay Bradley.  I’m ready.”  Mr. Wilkins says.

“Ready?” I ask.

“I’ve been mourning Jeannie’s death now for twenty-two years. It’s about time I moved on.  I may be sixty but I still have a lot of life to live.  I’m sorry I always called you death and caused you such a headache.  Jeannie always thought of the neighborhood children as our children since she couldn’t have any herself.”  A tear rolls down his cheek. “Seeing you these years always reminded me of her death and combine that with the drinking… I’m sorry.”

“Mr. Wilkins, it’s okay.”  I walk over to him setting the food down and I put an arm on his shoulder.
“Thank you Bradley, you’re a good kid.  I’m sure Jeannie would be proud of the man you turned into.  But now I got to make her proud of me.”  Mr. Wilkins shakes my hand and then walks to his front door.  He picks up a suitcase that sat beside it and heads out.

I stand there in shocked silence watching him walk to his car, a red Oldsmobile.  He looks back at me as he's opening his car door and gives me a wave.  I waved back and watched him drive down the street and on with the second part of his life.

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","If you think Daniel Hannan and Jacob Rees-Mogg can inspire a young working class generation who want a fairer, more meritocratic world with more opportunities, you're severely out of touch.
Realistically, conservatism; especially in it's private-school/Oxbridge connection in this country is never really going to inspire the majority of young people, because the figures in the conservative party are so far detached from the reality young people face, and the increasing prominence of figures from such privileged backgrounds just highlights class divisions and the lack of realistic upward mobility for the majority.
I also think you're wrong to assume the reason young people oppose the Tories is because of PR and lack of inspiration, as the ideology of the conservative party just doesn't line up with the majority of young people, as the conservatives continually work to solidify their base of elderly voters, they cement themselves as a party whose goal isn't bringing great opportunities to the young, it's just working for the elderly without much thought given to the younger people, or to the long term effect of their lack of thought for the future e.g. the viability of state pensions in the coming decades.
They further alienate the young with a focus on social conservatism, meaning that, by young people, they will always be seen as the party on the side of homophobia, sexism, racism, and any basically other kind of intolerance you could think of (hatred of the poor being another notable topic with the recent whatsapp leak, and the many stories of money burning in front of the homeless at oxbridge).
I think you're absolutely right to say that the status quo just isn't selling in politics right now, but I think the reason young people in particular, are energised by the ideas represented by Corbyn and Bernie Sanders is because the (relatively) radical changes they support aim to create a fairer and kinder world. So for many the conservative world of privatisation and nepotism and inequality just doesn't appeal, even if it is pushed by a similarly radical figure.

I can understand it mattering if you had weed around, because that could incriminate them as well should something happen, but you cant get arrested for being around someone who's high. So why does it matter? 

You are not selfish. In fact, you were considerate to not smoke in the apartment. You were considerate to immediately notice their feelings on the matter when you were high.

NOPE.

We did everything we could do for the puppy, but after three months we gave up.  She was still having accidents, she was WAY more high energy than we could have expected, she spent most of her time either destroying things or whining or barking non-stop (or chasing our poor cats).

We read every article, consulted every forum, rearranged our schedule to make sure she got the proper stimulation and care, but after three months we were just worn down to the bone.  It was so stressful and exhausting that we never had time to actually fall in love with her.  We dreaded coming home to her.

We did what was right for us -- and for her -- and found her a new home, somebody who already had an adult dog, who had kids to run her ragged, who had someone home all day, and whose schedule was flexible enough to actually spend time enjoying her.  It was the best thing for everyone involved.

"anime","t5_2qh22","I meant to write NCIS and wrote Shield by mistake (was refuting the idea that other average studios/directors/whatever have any relevance on a discussion about what to expect from a good studio), but yeah, I agree - you don't have to have completely novel ideas to be great. I don't think I ever suggested this and if I did then I apologize and retract it, because it runs counter to my views on fiction and I probably misspoke while trying to defend the myriad statements I've made on this branched-out discussion. (my favorite anime is FLCL; nothing about it is ideologically novel.) However, my view is that the craft KyoAni has perfected is that of *extremely* safe, predictable, easy storytelling. Their character writing is *not* special. Kobayashi isn't amazing - she exists in a highly stylized moe comedy and her character is only ""great"" relative to the standards that type of show has for characterization. Yeah she's relatable, I'm a sw dev and I had my self-insert moments with the show, but I definitely didn't find her ""great"" by any stretch. KyoAni's dramas are just as often melodramatic. Hibike is probably their most acclaimed ""drama"" and some of the conflicts in that show were too ridiculous or contrived to take seriously - because it's standard high school bullshit that you stop taking seriously once you grow up. Stuff like that is not compelling past a certain age unless you still think about your high school days all the time. Like, don't get me wrong, I like Hibike, but I'm not going to sit here and pretend that *that's* an example of a ""perfected craft"". The only thing they've perfected is their production, which is no small feat, and if that's what you want out of anime then I'm geniunely glad KyoAni exists for fans like you. I care more about the story being told and I do not think KyoAni tells great stories. That's not because I don't think stories about teenagers or stories set in high school can't be good - I just don't think the way they tell those stories is that good.

The fact that you think ""not slice of life and not in a high school"" is ""incredibly narrow and specific"" is barely even worth addressing. Actually, let me change the criteria - not even ""no slice of life"", just ""no slice of life with a heavy dose of CGDCT pandering"". There, I just loosened the restrictions considerably. In fact, let me make it really easy - *one* good anime with no CGDCT. That's it, that's literally the only ""restriction"". They can keep making Dragon Maids and K-Ons and Hibikes and Amagis and they should because they do it well. And I will legit consider them a top 3 studio if they also made **one** really good, really well-written (and well-directed and produced but I can expect that) anime that didn't involve CGDCT. (If that's Violet Evergarden, good, I'm planning on watching that anyway.) If you're saying KyoAni can't manage that, then my point is made - they're a good studio with great business practices that ultimately sticks to the safest, most predictable stories and because of that, they are not of the same quality as studios like SHAFT, Ghibli, and Production IG. They are a tier below.

"spikes","t5_2utkz","Gonti's helpful in matchups that play a lot of creatures on curve, but only when the game gets really grindy- The only matchup I've played regularly where this is the case is against GB Counters.

He's definitely still good against Control, but I would argue less so than TKS. And I think he's much worse than TKS against Ramp.

In both of those matchups the boardstate often devolves into a race where you want to kill them before they topdeck something relevant because your hand hate options have stripped them of interaction. The additional damage from TKS and the fact that it can clear away a gearhulk from their hand when it resolves usually adds up to a lot more impact than hitting a censor or harness lightning or glimmer with Gonti.

Keep in mind that TKS's ""draw a card"" downside becomes far less bad when they have to trigger it in response to his ETB effect, A'la harness lightning-ing him after he resolves but before he takes the harness.

That said, if we somehow ended up in this situation there would only be two options per the working of our term contracts: either the faculty member would take a 1/6th cut in pay for the year (we measure workload by 6ths on a 3/3 schedule) or more likely we'd find them an extra course for spring semester to make up the difference. At places with interim/January term/winter term adding a course then might work too.

Non-linear editing is defined by it's random access, and non-destructive editing. You can access any point in your source material, trim and expand to your heart content.

Back in the not-so-good old days of linear editing of video we would have a two deck machine. Or if you were on a budget, two one-deck machines. You kept your master in one side, and your source tapes on the other. You would cue up your source to where you wanted it. Then you would play and record onto the master. Then you would stop, move the source tape to the next point, or put in another source tape, and add the next part. If there were transitions or titles you had to do it at each cut point. It was all - well - linear.

If you worked with actual film, you cut the negatives (or positives depending on the stock) with a little guillotine and then glued them together in the order you wanted the footage. Then for distribution, it was re-photographed with title cards, masks, whatever. The term ""left on the cutting room floor"" comes from the fact that unused film frames were cut out and ad literum thrown on the floor. I did it once as an art project in school - one minute film or something like that. It was fun as far as novelty is concerned. But, you really appreciated sitting back down at final cut pro 1.2 on a G4 powermac from 1999. Waiting for your 15 second title sequence to render ... for an hour  ... didn't sem so bad anymore.

The issue is being overly selfish and I don't think you are doing that. If your parents mean friends won't talk to them because their son is gay, ask them why the choose to pick the mean people over their son they love? My mother did something similar to your parents and asked me (before and after I was *married*) to not be out when visiting and to keep it hidden. I did it once, hated it and said no more. She threw a fit, so I was ready to cave when a friend suggested that what was good for me was good for the rest of the family. I offered to ""not be gay"" when visiting if her, my dad, and may sisters agreed to not talk about, show, or reference their relationships or heterosexuality. I told her I would ""act not gay"" for as long as they did not rub it in my face. It lasted all of an hour during my visit before she blew up saying this was ""ridiculous"". I said I agreed and if she was out so was I. Was tense but the point was made.

Having said that, I don't think you have addressed the issues from your past. Putting them behind you and forgetting about them is not the same as dealing with them and they may be impacting your current depression. I think you would do well to get some counseling- as an American with Greek heritage I can still only imagine the pressure against being gay and going to a counselor. You need to address you past, work through the pain and anger, and let it go. At the end of the day you have fear and anger unresolved and bottled up and that colors darkness on every day you have. Do your self a big favor and see someone about that. It may make any visits *you choose to make* back to Greece better.

[The numbers say otherwise](https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2016/12/can-uber-ever-deliver-part-two-understanding-ubers-uncompetitive-costs.html)

&gt;Traditional taxi owners take 15 cents of each passenger dollar to cover dispatching, corporate overhead and profit while Uber currently takes 30 cents. But Uber’s costs are much, much higher; even though they provide less than half the service of traditional companies. The P&amp;L data clearly shows these charges come nowhere close to covering Uber’s actual corporate expenses. Unlike traditional cab companies, Uber fees need to cover the cost of global marketing, software development programs, branding and lobbying programs, the huge market development costs of Uber’s expansion into hundreds of new cities and must also fund a return on the $13 billion its owners have invested.

All those extras costs extra. So higher costs for less service does not equal wise management.

&gt;They are in the red because their fares are cheap and their CS refunds for almost any minor issues, neither of which can be said for cabs.

Yes, to the tune of customers only paying 41% of the cost of their trip. Blame whatever factor you want, that's not sustainable. What happens when they finally bleed through all the VC money? Are people going to be singing Uber's praises when it's full-time surge pricing?",1504224088

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Everything she describes in this video can be summed up in one word: Libertarian. And from the seventies and eighties a lot of the feminist rhetoric was very libertarian. But while the libertarian feminists were leading empowered lives, the Marxist feminists, who had been there from the very beginning of the Second Wave, were taking over the movement. Their goal was to destroy western civilization (use the ""master's tools"" to destroy the ""master's house"") by destroying the nuclear family, which required destroying marriage...which, for them, meant subjugating men. In the 1990s, libertarian feminists tried to gain the upper hand by creating organizations like the Independent Women's Forum to put a feminist mask on libertarianism, but given a choice between libertarianism, with its focus on scary freedom, and big government, with its promise of support, most women will choose big government, as advocated by the Marxist Feminists. So the ""Feminism 2.0"" she describes is nothing more than a reassertion of the libertarian mask, and all other things being equal, it's doomed to failure. Only a reset (economic, social, political) will loosen the grip of the Marxist feminists, and when that happens, most women will flee into the arms of traditional conservatism. Feminism cannot and will not happen unless and until female nature changes. Transhumanism, maybe? ... Edit: while posting this comment on the video, I noticed Paul's comment. He's more than 10 years behind me (just as I'm about 10 years behind Warren Farrell and George Gilder) and, like most MRAs, he never immersed himself in feminist literature the way I did, so he doesn't really understand them, and, last time I checked, he still hasn't fully red-pilled to female nature (MGTOW), so he is both unaware of the history and is still engaged in the futile effort to get feminists to stop beating up on men and shift their focus to demanding real gender equality.",1504224088

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","for cgi to be true or false there has to be evidence of cgi.  if there is evidence of cgi there is cgi.  the visual content on the video can provide clues as to whether something is cgi (ie. impossible acts), as can the data and metadata themselves.  find weirdness in any of those and you have evidence of alteration.  

what does the evidence show?  that there were some cgi'd planes (ie. clipping, mutating shape).  that there were no trailing vortices in the impact.  all these things wouldn't happen if it were unadulterated video of a real plane.  if it were true plane footage you'd see no mutating shape, no disappearing/escher wings, and wingtip vortices in the smoke.  you don't see that.  you see the opposite.  this doesn't mean planes weren't used at the event, just that the vids we've been shown, many of them are cgi'd.

"pcgamingtechsupport","t5_2vsoo","Yes.  Two things to look out for are the socket type and if the BIOS supports the processor.  Also, you can't use an Intel chip on a AMD board and vice-versa.

For example, the AMD A8 is a FM2+ socket while the latest i7 would be a LGA1151.

The BIOS thing will take a little more research.  I think it is more often an issue with Intel than AMD.  For example a 2nd gen Intel core i5 will work with all LGA1155 sockets, but a 3rd gen Intel core i5 will only work with some LGA1155 sockets.  Sometimes a BIOS update is required even though the socket is the same which can get tricky.

Why not be individuals and celebrate commonalities and differences with whoever you meet? Why do we need to have these arbitrary teams to determine who is ""us"" and who is ""them""? Why can't we be bubble tea bros (a joke but you get the idea) and not worry about how the prescribed labels fit? Why do we have to adhere to some ""Asian"" standard or ""black"" standard especially when we did not choose these for ourselves or our family? 

A big difference for you and I is that ""Asia"" is an actual place. I don't think people know or care that ""black"" is literally a label to both signify and justify injustice. Furthermore, there is nothing that can disqualify you as being Asian because it is a continent, a physical place. If you were born on the continent (or have family born on the continent) then you are Asian. Period. There is no such math for being black... ""Black"" is a name given to us by white people to ensure unequal treatment under the law, and it works well to this day.

The Magic had turned the corner...they were 19-11 on Jan 1, 2015, Skiles had just won coach of the month and had a top 10 defense...then Elfrid Payton went down with injury and the back up PG (Watson) had already suffered a torn achilles in the first week of the season.  Skiles was force to give big minutes Shabazz fucking Napier and use Mario Hezonja as the back up PG.  Then Fournier went down with injury as well.  This caused the Magic to free fall...but they leveled off as EP and Fournier returned to health in the final month and ended up with 35 wins...a 10 win improvement from the prior season.  

Then out of the blue Skiles quits...apparently he and Rob Hennigan were at each other's throats.  This causes the Magic to hire Frank Vogel and he totally derailed the progress made.  He forced the Magic to play two center lineups with Aaron Gordon at SF and flat out refused to play the front court lineup that every Magic fan were licking their chops to see Fournier at SF / Gordon at PF / and Ibaka at C.  He didn't play them one single minute.  Every single Magic player regressed under Vogel.   Hopefully Vogel learned his lesson and plays to the young core's strengths instead of against the grain.  If he adapts, expect the Magic to surprise a lot of people.  ",1504224093

If you are bouncing between 3980 and 4010 in which you lose 3 and win two, you will end in Master, thus being rewarded with the Master tier. It will make no difference to us in Grandmaster and Master, I believe. I think the main reason for this was so Diamond players has incentives to keep playing instead of give up at 3000, y'know?

"webdev","t5_2qs0q","You should be separating the logic from the template.  

When displaying the HTML/CSS/JS you should be using a templating engine with the variables needed for the page assigned.  This would allow for caching the template and reduce load time.  So what you say is more natural is actually bad practice.  

In PHP you would use something like Blade, Twig, Smarty.  Assign a variable from PHP (like `$smarty-&gt;assign('smartyVariableHere', $phpVarHere);`) and then use it in the template (like `&lt;span&gt;{$smartyVariableHere}&lt;/span&gt;`)  

You **do not** want PHP or logic in your templates.  Beyond a very basic website you will quickly become an alcoholic and die from poisoning.  SMF does it and you cannot change the theme or install mods without easily breaking the entire thing because the themes have code in them.

Javascript on the server will likely return a response in JSON and essentially be a REST API.  If not then it's still the same as PHP in that you do not want your code in templates.

As for the element, Fire, Water, Ice, Energy, Darkness, and Light are ruled out because your weapons for those elements are great, so that just leaves Earth and Wind. Either would be fine, but a) it would affect your UG shield element also, and Notus is probably better than Chimeran / Tectonic Tower, and b) the top Wind weapon, Tempest Scimitar, is cheaper (Rare) than the top Earth weapon, Giant Butcherer (UR), and you already have a couple things to get from UR.

She would be sister-in-law to Bran, Sansa and Arya (not technically, but assuming that they continue to see Jon as a brother, which we are assuming they will for the moment). This would make any children they had her nieces and nephews by marriage. They would also be Jon and Dany's children's cousins. But, if Jon's child is also his cousin, then he will also be both uncle and cousin to the next generation of Starks.

Phew. Someone check my math!

Edit: and the Stark kids are cousins to Robert Aryn of the Vale, which means that technically, if the Riverlands were reclaimed for a Tully heir, Dany could become family to three houses (Stark, Aryn and Tully) in one marriage.

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","Now that reminds me of my youth.  When I was in college,they had a ""design your own major"" program.  And so I did.  Then you had to meet with the Dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences to argue your proposal.

I still remember the guy. He had a bow tie.  How fitting.  I told him that my major was Renaissance Studies, which meant studying everything to the 400 course level.  I told him that I wanted to study everything to the point of diminishing returns.

He rather haughtily asked me what I meant by this ""so-called point of diminishing returns,"" so I explained.  As I study a subject and get to higher level classes,learn more and more about less and less.   I want to be a Renaissance man and understand my universe.  I am an astronomy major among other things, and right now the next course in line is ""Space Plasma Physics."" Interesting subject, but less useful than diving into something new.

He kind of turned a little red and then told me, ""There is no such thing as a point of diminishing returns in education.  You need to pick something and specialize in it. If you are serious about education, you should pursue it to a PhD.""

I told him, ""Not for me.  I would have to keep taking more and more limited classes to the point where I was an expert on things that no one cares about and that don't really matter. And then I would have to get a Masters, which means becoming an expert on a point so esoteric that I could not even discuss it with anyone else.  And then to get a PhD, I would have to learn everything about nothing."" This occurred not long after my favorite astronomy professor told me that his specialty was the polarization of light from globular clusters of stars that lie outside the plane of the galaxy.

The dean looked at me, and we both knew my major was not getting any approval. 

Like you, I am by nature a jack of all trades and a master of none.  I do not want to master anything, I want to see the connections between everything.  For me, it is all about the connections.  Specializing in anything would kill me.

Now having said that, let me also say that it is just how I am.  I know others who derive great meaning and pleasure from specializing.  They pick a subject and not only master it, but advance our understanding of it.  Their knowledge of their area is truly profound. I totally respect those people, and I know that I stand on their shoulders while I skim their knowledge.  Life would totally suck without them, and arguably they provide more social benefit than I do.  I would never say that my way is right, just right for me.

The world needs both types.  We need people that see the big picture and the people who drill deeper than anyone has before.  The key is to know which type you are and not get stuck on the wrong side of the chasm.",1504224103

Make her into a tank.

M1 leave it as it is, maybe make the projectile move faster. 

M2: lower the max damage to 60, to balance her HP buff, BUT give her a 2.5 critical hit bonus. This will still allow her to one shot tracers and it's a significant broadening of her skillfloor to ceiling window. ",1504224104

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Not an incel, and I don't like the way they think, but I think statistically I can somewhat answer your first question. With the sort of societal movement toward the sexual liberation of women that happened over the last few decades, women realized that as long as they don't get pregnant, they can go out and have as much sex as they want with as many people as they want, just like guys could do for pretty much forever. They still risk being labeled a slut, but no one is going to literally kill them for it anymore in America (which is generally the entire worldview of an incel). I think it's probably true that most people like sex. If you could have sex basically whenever you wanted, you would, I imagine. That is the situation that some women (and a few men) find themselves in. Now that they're free to enjoy sex equally, they have it often with many people. As time has gone on, this has become more common and accepted for women, after all, guys have been doing it forever. Incels see this, and combined with their hatred for ""chad"", assume ALL women are perpetually cock-hungry sluts, even though that's like a very small portion. 

TL;DR it's a combination of recent societal view changes regarding female sexuality and the incel's hatred of women and ""chads"" and their need to vilify them.",1504224108

Bismuth can hold void mana because it isn't a gem and because of it's inherent brittleness. Just like higher concepts bismuth can be broken with brute force or overwhelming power.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","It honestly wasn't too bad. The guy was pleasant and seemed overall sane. There was just weird expectations. There was a definite ""tit for tat"" thing going on, which I wasn't too fond of. Like, ""I did X for you, so you should do Y"". Also, he felt the things he did had bigger weight to them than I thought they did.

For example, if he was at the store and he'll text if I wanted anything, and I am all like, ""Oh, that's sweet! Can you pick up a drink and I'll pay you back."" He'll do it, and be happy to do it. No issues. But then a week later, I'll be studying for a test and be really busy, and he'll be upset that I had no time to see him. He'll say something like, ""Well, I took the time to pick up that soda. I don't know why you can't find the time to hang out for an hour or two."" I am like 1) how are the two related?? and 2) how does you taking one minute to grab a soda when you are already at the store equate to 1 to 2 hours of hang out time?

Overall, he was actually really nice. He was polite and friendly and pretty empathetic, helped out friends at the drop of the hat, volunteered with at risk youth, helped little old ladies cross the road, saved kittens, etc.  But we didn't have much in common and the weird expectations were aggravating. Everything felt like a transaction. And he began getting possessive and controlling and veiling it as concern. ""I don't like it when you take trips to the city because it is dangerous."" ""I don't think you should work at that GameShop because it is sketchy."" ""I'll go with you to the store, to keep you safe."" I am all like, ""Dude, we live in middle America where the last big crime spree was kids vandalizing a sheep. I am sure I'll be fine going down the street to pick up bread."" Then he would be offended that I didn't take his concerns seriously. ""I care for you and want you to be safe. I do so much for you, and I am just asking you to do this one little thing for my peace of mind."" Really... odd.

I honestly don't think his behavior would've escalated into abuse territory. We had stayed in contact and he commissioned work from me a few times, and he was great to work with. He is now happily married and has a kid he gushes about 24/7 on Facebook, so I am hoping he outgrew some of those ""nice guy"" behaviors and his wife isn't actually trapped in a safety basement somewhere with a scorecard taped to her face.",1504224110

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt; If you don't believe that there should be planning

The system I've proposed is effectively a hybrid of Gift Economy and Decentralized Planned Economy. 

&gt; So far, at least to me, it seems mostly like simple market action

If you define ""market"" in such a broad way, then okay. Calling it a ""market"" is an objectively incorrect description. But I'm not one who has much interest in debating semantics so that's fine.

&gt; The 'competitive gifting networks' are literally just money and traditional banking in another name, insofar as people keep track of who is owed what and the IOUs are transferrable and universal and can be used to accumulate purchasing power. Then you iterate back and forht abut this making contracts and purchase orders. Fine. Mostly markets.

There's really no purchasing going on here. But, again, I think your use of terms like ""market"", ""purchase"", etc... is a lot more broad than what these terms actually mean. But I won't debate semantics if that's the only point of disagreement. 

&gt; Lets talk about that, because the link you gave explicitly rebuts that

There are no specific committees that plan production or craft algorithms or anything of the sort. I mean, if producers want to organize in that way they are free to do so. But there's no defined, ossified structure like that which would actively make the overall economic plan. It's trial and error. 

The federation of communes and council democracy that I mentioned was a system of overseeing the planning process. And one of its roles would be to safeguard the integrity of the databases used to store information. The federation does not actively engage in planning itself. Nor does it actively input, modify, or in some way alter the information in said databases. The federation of communes is not an organizational form of the producers. 

&gt; SPECIFICALLY, what I want to know is this part! HOW will producers, or the commune federation, or whatever you want to call them, take these lists of preferences and turn them into the resource allocation and distribution numbers.

Do mean ""resource allocation and distribution **decisions**""?

It's helpful to think of this as two components: the supply-side and the demand-side. On the demand side, consumers are creating and adjusting their personal consumption lists (lists indicating what they want to consume and in which they can specifically pick particular producers they favor). This would take the form of an electronic list, whose contents are aggregated alongside the contents of all other people's lists. As far as a specific algorithm for how these contents are aggregated into the whole? Let's take a simple example: I want a black Mercedes car, you want a black Mercedes car, and so do 1000 other people. Now you have the total number of black Mercedes cars that are being requested. But, each of us doesn't want it equally. I put it on top of my list and you put it on the bottom of your list. So I want a black Mercedes car more than you want it. And (obviously) a black Mercedes car is not the only thing that you, I, or the 1000 other people want. 

Now the question is, how can resources be allocated and distributed such that:

A) **All** people's basic needs (food, water, housing, clothing, healthcare) are satisfied. 

B) the greatest proportion wants are met across the population, with the priority of meeting the wants that people place higher on their lists over those that people place lower on their lists. From a purely algorithmic or computation standpoint, I suppose one could have a points system that sets greater points for satisfying wants that are higher on personal consumption lists than those that are listed lower. And numerically this could be represented such that it's clear how well wants are being satisfied across the population in aggregate. There could be a total points count that would represent the Perfect Scenario where all wants and all needs are satisfied. Then the total number of points that an economic plan would satisfy for the population could be divided by the total number of points available to be satisfied (what the Perfect Scenario would represent). This lets us compare the quality of one economic plan to another or keep track of how changes in a plan would impact its overall quality in creating equilibrium between supply and demand. Hell, we could make this into a fun game to encourage productive competition between producers where those who contribute to the most points being satisfied within a particular category of good/service that was requested, are awarded with some sort of Big Man-esque social status (which goes back to the notion of competitive Gift Economy). This just one possible way. (And to be clear, the points are not some kind of money that people can use to buy things with. So don't let that cause confusion.) I'm sure someone like u/metalliska can come up with an even better method/algorithm (or perhaps has already done so).

The actual process of drafting and editing an economic plan prior to its implementation is basically trial and error via the iteration process facilitated by mesh networking (just as I described in the comments I linked to - it's a lot to read, but it's the best way to understand what I'm talking about).

Of course, the only real concern is that eventually games might be developed to be ridiculously grindy to force you to buy these loot boxes.  As it stands now though, we have no evidence that's the case in single player games.

When you look at a map of the US, especially the typical classroom maps, you see the mainland which hosts 48 states and then you have Hawaii in the bottom corner and Alaska in the other corner. This makes 50. However, it's easy to disassociate Alaska and Hawaii in our heads when we picture a map of the US we usually just envision the shape of the main land. I remember as a kid I was one of those pretentious little shits. 

Friend: there are 50 states! 

Me: come look at the map, look there are actually 52. *points to Alaska and Hawaii*

"nba","t5_2qo4s","* 1996 - Marcus Camby - 2nd Overall - Very Good Pick
* 1997 - Tracy McGrady - 9th Overall - Great Pick - HOF - Generational Talent
* 1998 - Vince Carter - 5th Overall - Good Pick - Dirk and Paul Pierce drafted a couple spots later
* 1999 - Traded 5th pick for Antonio Davis, not bad. Mid-Round pick is a miss with a couple studs drafted after but they play positions Toronto doesnt need at the time. Toronto needed Jason Terry from this draft, pretty big miss.
* 2000 - late pick misses, but nothing really to hit
* 2001 - mid round miss, couple picks later is Zach Randolph at the same position. Randolph developed a little later but that could be because he was on Portland. A good franchise might have been able to get something out of him. I'd count this as a miss.
* 2002 - late round miss, Carlos Boozer, a position of need was selected a few spots later. Made sense at the time, this is a bad pick.
* 2003 - Chris Bosh - Pretty big hit, Wade selected afterwards might be a little better but can't really argue with this
* 2004 - miss with the 8th pick on a center. Andre Iguodala goes next. Al Jefferson goes a few picks later at a position of need. Bad draft.
* 2005 - miss with the 7th pick on a SF. Andrew Bynum goes a couple picks later at a position of need. Danny Granger also goes a few picks later at another position of need. Bad draft.
* 2006 - miss with the 1st pick on Bargnani. Aldridge goes 2nd. Bad draft.
* 2007 - Toronto traded all their picks away for pretty much nothing but theres nothing to take where they would have selected anyways
* 2008 - Toronto traded the draft pick that becomes Roy Hibbert for Jermaine O'Neil. Oops, bad trade, bad draft.
* 2009 - Take Demar Derozan 9th, good pick.
* 2010 - miss on Ed Davis at 13th, nothing too great afterwards except Avery Bradley a few picks later. Can't really say too much about this.
* 2011 - mostly a miss on Jonas with the 5th pick. Kemba, Klay, Kawhi and Butler go after. Pretty bad draft.
* 2012 - miss on Terrence Ross at 8th, Andre Drummond goes next. 
* 2013 - Toronto trades the pick that becomes Steven Adams for Kyle Lowry. This is pretty good.
* 2014 - miss with the 20th pick on Bruno Caboclo, Clint Capela goes a couple picks later. Kind of bad but not that big of a deal
* 2015, 2016, 2017 - Too early to tell.  
  
The Camby, McGrady, Vince trifecta could have been good enough to make a finals but the Raptors were dumb and traded Camby for Oakley, and they weren't able to keep McGrady after 3 seasons. Kobe Bryant said the Raptors with McGrady and Carter would have been good enough to go to several finals if the stayed together, and they would have likely played against Kobe and Shaq. Then Carter wanted to get traded because he was lied to about who the new GM was going to be. He wanted Julius Erving because he wanted someone who could get free agents to come to Toronto. The Raptors hired Babcock instead, someone who sucked. Even though Carter was told Erving was a serious contender, he later found out he was never really in the running. Toronto alienated there only star they had left (after making McGrady's early years hell) cementing them as a place to stay away from if you were a free agent. Babcock was also a pretty big reason they have all of those lottery misses with other stars drafted right after Toronto missed. If there was a better GM, maybe Bosh doesn't need to leave during FA either. The Raptors had a bunch of generational talent they squandered as well as a bunch of chances to draft significant players to help them win, but they failed. The Raptors have had every opportunity to make a finals but they haven't because they sucked, not because they're young. The Heat won in 2006 and they were on pretty much the same path as the Raptors for a lot of years, but the Heat won because they made smarter moves. In other sports, the Marlins have been around about the same as the Raptors and have 2 titles. The Rockies are about the same age too and they made the world series. The Diamondbacks are 7 years younger and have a title. The Rays are 7 years younger and made a world series. The Carolina Panthers are the same age as the Raptors and have 2 super bowl appearances. Most expansion teams in all of the sports that are roughly the same age or younger have made a finals, but the Raptors haven't because they fucked up. ",1504224116

Floss and brush your teeth super well and lick your wrist and smell it before every class to make sure it's not bad breath. Shower and wash every nook and cranny in the morning and after exercise if you do that before class. I would ditch cologne if you wear it. Personally i found it a little nauseating whenever i could smell someones perfume or cologne in class rooms. 
Don't wear dirty clothes to class ever. Even pants that you dont think are dirty yet. Other people can smell it before you can. If you have dandruff on your head/shoulders that can also be an issue.

Honestly looking back i only ever avoided other people for those issues, and i noticed i had people avoiding me less when i started taking better care of my hygiene. 

Also, it's a trial and error process. There isn't a simple guide that fits everyone. Some people have unique challenges and a tougher time reaching good hygiene than some people with naturally good genetics.

Please don't take any offense to this. Its just the only honest advice i can give without knowing you better. ",1504224119

"Nootropics","t5_2r81c","I suppose I should have added a link.  [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net) is basically a fancy flashcard deck.  If you can put information on a flashcard you can put it in Anki. If it's information you need to memorize, that's where Anki excels.   Instead of figuring out on your own what cards you need to study and what ones you already know, Anki does it for you.  After you learn them Anki spaces them out just enough that you aren't bothered by reviewing cards you already know.  It also makes managing your decks easy.  It's most commonly used by med and vet students as well as language learners.

Advice: just get started.  Don't worry about perfection or understanding everything or you will be overwhelmed.  Use the desktop app at first and try out the mobile in a couple of weeks.  You will probably spend more time creating cards than reviewing them.  That's probably fine.  Creating cards is half the learning process.  Just don't hyperfocus on the cards too much.  Study every day.  You may only have 5 new cards and 25 to reviews each day.  Even though it's only 10 minutes of work, you have to stick with it.  In the beginning you may only have 3 or 4 minutes of work each day.  Resist the temptation to up your new card count.  In a week or so you will level off to a sustainable 10,20 or whatever minutes per day.",1504224119

A 1 SCU outer container dimensions is 1.25m^3, because the container walls are 0.125m and then the storage space inside is 1m^3.

A 2 SCU container is a 2.5m x 1.25m x 1.25m container with a 2.25m x 1.0m x 1.0m available interior space.

At any given point, you will have more income boosting cards than you can play, so do a little financial analysis to see which ones will get you more GPT. Often I run the harbor card and not the commerce hub card mid game, since it is easier to get high harbor adjacency bonuses, and it stacks with the production buff. Stacking external trade route cards late game also helps. There are great persons that directly or indirectly buff GPT. 

Resorts are OP as fuck. Yield = appeal, with appeal doubled by cristo, makes 2 food/10 gold/10 tourism tiles pretty easy to pump out.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","It doesn't help that the Bears kept the trade-up completely under wraps. All those TV personalities were caught off guard but had to give their opinions on it fairly immediately. Easy ratings to shit on the Bears there.

I saw criticism that the Bears didn't need to trade up. That's been dis-proven, we know the 49rs had other offers for the #2 pick and Trubisky is the only guy someone would trade up to #2 to get.

I saw criticism that he only played one year in college...well who the fuck cares and it was a great year. How many QBs drafted in the NFL started 2 or 3 years in college, looked great, and turned into duds?

Honestly, even before the draft happened the media was talking constantly about how some teams were rating Trubisky as the top QB in the draft. It's not a surprise he was picked as the first QB, or that a team would trade up for him.

In the end it will depend on how well he does, and he is looking pretty damn good. But even then I try not to shit on a team for a pick like that because picks in the draft are basically 50/50 whether the player works out for the team, hell it's even worse for QBs. There is so much development and experience needed to be a successful QB in the NFL compared to college and the guys who embrace that and put their entire selves into that effort are the ones with the best shot to become great.",1504224123

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah, I'm pretty guilty of this, to the point where until you raised it I didn't even think of it as a problem. I'll try to go over my reasons as to why.

1. I don't like social media. I go on forums, Reddit, really any site that allows me to be (mostly) anonymous, but there's something daunting about going on facebook and actually posting something. Like sending out a text or a message, there isn't any body language or tones of voices to communicate body language, so it's easy to mistake my meaning. Unlike private messaging, my mistakes are public and can be seen and interpreted by anyone, at any time.

2. I fear the opinions of strangers, both on the individual scale and as a mob. Say I posted something controversial, and went in for an interview ten years later. That boss might decide to look me up and find that subject. If nothing else it might make my life a bit more difficult, and at worst it might cost me a job. Now say we scale that up, and that controversial post goes viral in the wrong places. I line myself for doxxing, harassment, a pressure to fire me, anything and its all out of my control. I've seen it happen a few times on the internet, and it's an experience I could do without.

4. It feels fake. Because of this fear of saying anything harmful, of misinterpretation, of knowing that all of this will be known forever, it just feels more like a job to keep it up, and it feels exhausting doing it. 

For the reasons above, I've never felt comfortable using social media sites. That being said, I do use Facebook as a means of coordinating events, getting a snapshot of a person's life, and connecting to them for stuff like Facebook messenger. ",1504224126

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I think you have a few things wrong. 

What are Western Christian values/culture? There's so many denominations, variance within denominations, and not to mention variance within history. What will you do when basic christian values are not agreeable to you? The bible suggests that women should be silent in church and that one man wanting to put his willy in another man is an abominable sin and lots and lots of christians agree with this, that men and women have different roles and that homosexuality is against God. Western liberal democracies however do not support these values. What happens when the basic values i.e. don't kill people and worship your God turn out to be the same as basically any other religion? 

Culture and values are constantly changing, absorbing influences, and updating for the new world and new generations.

You make other claims I want to address. For instance, you suggest Islam has been extremely unsuccessful. On the basis of the last few decades this claim might be reasonable but on the basis of the last 1500 years it is patently, deeply wrong. The islamic conquest was *enormously* successful. At their furthest extent, Timbuktu in Mali, the Pyrenhees mountains in southern Spain, Slovenia, India and Persia, even parts of Southern Sicily were under Muslim rule. They toppled the Byzantine Empire, their navies ruled the mediterranean.

Don't let the current state of the middle east confuse you. In 1550, Istanbul was the only city in the world with free healthcare and education, religious freedom and massive state investment in arts and culture which puts nearly all of medieval europe to shame comparatively, despite the Enlightenment. For instance, Jews were still banned from England at this time, one of the greatest shames of bigotry of a country with a lot to be ashamed of in its past.

Muslims were the world's best sailors, most advanced scientists and astronomers, and had one of the finest literary traditions. The Persian and Arabic art music and poetry was one of the world's finest. The arabic language was the most widely spoken in the world, and the beaureacracy of the Ottoman empire was the world's most efficient, the only state at that time capable of maintaining such a large empire. 

Muslims invented Algebra and the idea of raising numbers to a power. The University. Clocks. Drinking coffee. Some of the first decent surgical instruments. The first truly accurate navigational maps. These are all products of muslim culture we've been happy to add.

Really, it is only recently in the life of Islam that the arabic world has become backwards and ultra-conservative as a reaction to the collapse of the old muslim states and western encroachment. We're still happy to take their oil, mind. And flog them weapons.",1504224128

It's has the *opposite* effect by subconsciously treating it as just another annoyance some people have to deal with, rather than the physically and psychologically damaging trauma that it really is.

Context and subtext are critically important when discussing sensitive issues like rape. A 20-something white dude on Twitch has a statistically low chance of fully understanding the lasting effects this kind of violence has on him directly. His incredibly poor tact of discussing it in the context of stream sniping makes it all the more inappropriate.

Would it be possible to work out all the areas that can be reached from the beginning without any keys at all, then make sure that at least one enemy type from one of those areas drops a variety of catalyst?

It would still be random, just guaranteeing that a catalyst can always be found at any time, which is no different than making the key spawns always reachable in my opinion.

I'm not sure how you handle enemy drops in your randomizer, but if it works like I'm assuming it does, then if one random enemy type that is reachable at all times is assigned a random catalyst as a percentage chance drop, then I believe it solves your problem without compromising the integrity of the project.",1504224129

Leading up to my first marathon, I averaged ~20 mpw. My second marathon I bumped that up to 36 mpw. That spans from 2008 through March of 2009. From 2009 through the first half of 2011, I averaged 36 mpw, not very consistently, occasionally running a random 60 mile week, and a lot of weeks of nothing. Then something just sort of clicked in my head that I need to get serious. For the second half of 2011, I averaged 93 mpw. I maintained that through the first half of 2012 (so basically, an entire year at 93 mpw). Then the next two years kind of just stopped running. I wasn't injured, mostly I was stuck in a shitty relationship, increased depression, and a general malaise that lingered for a while. I averaged ~23 mpw for up through early 2014, when I tried to build back slowly. I worked up to 60 mpw for most of 2014, before once again just falling off with running because of life and depression. I barely ran at all in 2015 (15 mpw) and only marginally more in 2016 (17 mpw). Starting in December of last year, I decided I wanted to get serious about running and try to make it stick this time. So I eased back on the lifting, ran 40 miles that first week, then ~50, then 63, and have been continuing to build for the past 8 months. For large chunks of this year, I've averaged ~90 mpw and plan to run ~110-120 mpw up through December.

Now that I think about it, I can see another foil to Chloe: Meditation XVII by John Donne: 


&gt; No man is an island entire of itself; every man 

&gt; is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; 

&gt; if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe 

&gt; is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as 

&gt; well as any manner of thy friends or of thine 

&gt; own were; any man's death diminishes me, 

&gt; because I am involved in mankind. 

&gt; And therefore never send to know for whom 

&gt; the bell tolls; it tolls for thee. 


And the reason why I bring this up (ignoring the obvious symbolism of Chloe accepting people again) is because the comparison between Donne's narrator and Prospero has been made before, by British writer Neil Gaiman in the final issue of The Sandman. 


At the start of the comic, Shakespeare and Morpheus had struck a bargain: in exchange for two plays, Morpheus would provide Shakespeare with the power to give men dreams that would live on after you were gone.' During this issue, Morpheus (The King of Stories) and William Shakespeare are toasting the end of Shakespeare's career. Shakespeare, wondering why such a creature as Morpheus would grant a mortal such as he this gift, and why Morpheus asked for the plays he did (A Midsummer Night's Dream and The Tempest), asks his patron. Morpheus replies: 


&gt; 'I wanted a tale of graceful ends. I wanted a play about a king who drowns his books, and breaks his staff, and leaves his kingdom. About a magician who becomes a man. About a man who turns his back on magic.' (We'll get to that in a minute)

&gt; 'But why?' Shakespeare asks. 

&gt; 'That is not your concern, Will.'

&gt; 'Not my concern? I gave you twenty years. I wrote your plays... I have earned an answer to my question. Why?'

&gt; 'Because I will never leave my island.'

&gt; 'You live on an island?'

&gt; 'I am... In my fashion... An Island...'

&gt; 'But that can change. All men can change.'

&gt; 'I am not a man.'

&gt; 'But...'

&gt; 'And I do not change.' 


So, if we can think of Morpheus as giving us one interpretation on Prospero, then we can actually see some neat little similarities between him and Chloe. Like Prospero, Chloe is trapped in an idyllic location (the island for Prospero, Arcadia Bay for Chloe) against her will after a great tragedy (Prospero's brother's treachery and Chloe's father's death)with a small support system to support her/cast of characters. While these equivalencies aren't perfect, they do make a lot of sense. 


Playing the part of Ariel, we have the innocent and almost feminine Elliot. 

For Miranda, the family member trapped with our hero, we have Joyce. 

Playing the role of Caliban, the deformed creature who tried to rape Miranda, we have David Madsen. (Not that I'm accusing David of attempted rape, but from Chloe's POV I'd imagine any kind of penetration would be thought of as a kind of assault). 


But what of Prospero's magic? What's Chloe's magic? Her rage (which in BTS is expressed in her ability to backtalk) and her belief that she is the one who controls her own destiny. 


Okay, so we've got some equivalencies. So what? Well, what I'm edging towards is the idea that the central theme of Before the Storm (and possibly Life is Strange itself, from Chloe's point of view) is not so much Rachel and Chloe's relationship (although that's a big part of it) but rather Chloe, like Morpheus, looking for ways in which she can change and escape Arcadia Bay and learning that she is 'not an island' so to speak. 


Now, although I suspect this might start a flame war, I don't think it's Rachel that teaches Chloe this. Chloe is certainly older in Life is Strange, but between Awaken and Chrysalis she hadn't really grown as a person. But between Chrysalis and Dark Room we do see a lot of character growth: she gains empathy (for Kate Marsh), admits that she really loves her mom and doesn't want to see Arcadia Bay turned to glass, lets go of her rage, and is able to really articulate (possibly for the first time ever) how upset she was about her dad's death. By the end of the game, Chloe really has changed for the better. And it's only because of this change that Chloe can finally leave - whether that is with Max, loved and loving in turn, or through the veil of tears and into the kingdom of death. 


And for one final equivalency, just because it's so juicy: 

What heralds Prospero's growth? The sudden re-appearance of his brother, Antonio, after a storm. 

What heralds Chloe's growth? The sudden re-appearance of her best friend, Max, after a vision of a storm. 


Now, I have no idea if Rachel has any powers or not, but I really do like this idea, and it was **hella** fun brainstorming this. I just hope somebody reads it.

Wide exercises tend to target the chest/back or lats more which is why people like doing them. Lots of people can do them and not get injured, and some people have increased propensity for injury over others (see: type 3 acromions).

&gt;But you can't say the DNC shenanigans didn't have an impact on the outcome of the election. Further, to suggest Warren didn't play a role in all that is disingenuous. Warren pounced at the opportunity to endorse HRC, even as the DNC controversy was breaking, even though her political views aligned with Sanders. To me, it appeared as a calculated political move with the intent to secure a cabinet position in HRC's administration. Politics as usual.

This is all speculation. And, I might add, speculation that those Russia twitter-bots *wanted* out there to divide the left.You have no idea what Warren's motivations are, and to say that she ""pounced"" is laughable.

My only quibble with much of the hate is that it isn't being directed at the people who deserve it the most: Sony. The people who took a small, simple space exploration game and through corporate marketing and Sean Murray's utter lack of morals and integrity blew it up into something it could never hope to be.

Failing to raise the debt ceiling would be catastrophic—at least as catastrophic as Hurricane Harvey, probably worse, and entirely self-inflicted. The debt ceiling isn't authorization to spend more; it's authorization to pay the bills we've already incurred.

There's also a good reason these things should be connected. If we pass Hurricane Harvey aid, but then we hit the debt ceiling, then suddenly we won't actually have the money for the aid Congress just authorized. Passing Harvey aid without raising the debt ceiling is actually a really, really stupid thing to do.

This is actually a fantastic idea—notwithstanding the fact it came from Trump. Here Trump is, thumbing his nose at the freedom caucus to do something that happens to be very important for the economic wellbeing of our country. To attack him for wanting the debt ceiling raised is politically irresponsible. The debt ceiling shouldn't really exist at all, and it must be raised to avoid default on our nation's debt.",1504224134

[This interactive infographic from the Economist shows the scale of the issue.](https://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2016/06/daily-chart-1)

[Scott Santens article on the topic is here.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-santens/the-economist-just-came-o_b_7447312.html)

Also, the real cost of the UBI is actually only the [transfer cost](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-cost-of-universal-basic-income-is-the-net-transfer_us_5963d0c7e4b0deab7c646ace), which makes it far more manageable when you realise this.

From where I'm sitting, a rough and ready assessment, I can see that the US already spends about $7k per person between welfare, social security and government pensions. So that's over half way there. And then looking at your healthcare system the US spends about $6k more on average than the average OECD country. So if you can shift your healthcare system to an affordable universal one like nearly all other countries, there's so much scope for taxing more without people feeling any more strain than they already are, PLUS they'd be receiving a $12k UBI.

In reality there's no cost to the economy, because the money still goes into hands that will spend it in your economy, in fact, poor people have a higher marginal propensity to consume which means that it will actually help to address your collapsing [money velocity](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V), and mean that you can stem the flow of the massive and dangerous money printing that the US govt is undertaking.

There is a TEQ SSR Yamcha that you can buy with Baba gems who greatly lowers attack and as such is great for various bosses and events.  Again from Baba's Shop there is Piccolo and Krillin who reduce damage by 50% with a type advantage.  Of course there is SR Chiaotzu who I think also has SSR versions of himself in Baba's shop, but his passive skill of stunning all enemies once on his first turn is the bread and butter of a lot of WT players, same with Jaco.

You've probably pulled some first-form Friezas and those can be used to upgrade the super attack for LR Frieza.  Captain Ginyu will also have an LR form as well.

Other than that, it depends on what SSRs you have and what banners you;re thinking of pulling in the future.  For instance I have an SSR INT Vegeta who has the candy skill for Buu's event and I've pulled tons of SR regular Vegetas who can be used to upgrade his super attack.  Same with Super Saiyan Bardock, etc.

You never know what SSR you'll pull in the future, and what cards will get a rebirth (like that Thouser card or whatever his name is from the curent banner) so you're almost always better off keeping the cards and spending stones on box space.

Some real trash SRs though are other Ginyu Force units, Dr Gero, most of the universe 6 cards imo, etc.",1504224135

Totally agree w Lastimeopiates. Find a non-opiate med for pain. You will be surprised if u get off opiates and I had two huge surgeries

which one? are there so many? why you NEED them 100% to be presented in your SH\Ship? Why cant you get them again on new server? 

-------------------------------------


&gt; Cost

just curious have you thought about it and estimated it? How much exactly? But please not some ""we've spent if i remember 10 billions"" ....you want something exactly to have on new server...guildship - 50m, full unlock - how much? Really need full unlocked ship?  Guild Sh - how much? Guild bank - how much etc etc....what's the number? is it so huge, I mean I actually have no idea...200 millions? 500....1 billion? is it all necessary right away? Dont you want to gain it slowly with your friends? guild farm of commanders like old times, guild runs for NiM decos, happiness to get something and run with everyone into SH to place it and argue in teamspeak where this Oriconion warrior statue has to be placed? You really want exactly static copy of everything you got now? 

---------------------------------


&gt; My friends won't move with me.

why do you need to move then at all? You're playing on Progenitor i suppose? Its not a dead server. Even if it was dead tofn why do you need to move if you play with friends? Not enough people for 8m raid or want 16m? Cant find people for WZ? Cant talk to other guild left to organize coop runs of Ops or Wzs? 

I moved to well-populated server cause I play alone without guild so I need many people in GF to run group content but for established guild, for a person who plays with friends...do you really need other people on server?


And again progenitor is far from dead, why do you NEED to move?

------------------------------------------


&gt; TRE has no RP


well, forced merges (which Im against and that is the main idea of my initial post) will make everything much worse for you, wont they? Now you have a choice, you can stay on rp server or leave for high-populated one, with merges you'll be forced to play on no-rp server. Or you want to get merged with american RP? I doubt its possible due to server locations and thus latency issues, or merged with german\french RP? Do you think you can RP with german-only or french-only speaking people? I mean they play on their own servers for a reason, probably because they prefer to speak their own language. DO they want to be merged into english-speaking server? Will they communicate with english-speaking RPers? There are a lot of questions here...


What's you idea overall? what do you want?  

------------------------------------------ 

&gt; realistically server merges have to happen.


I think it has to happen only if Bioware let people chose to stay where they are or transfer to some server of their choice. It would be awesome and right to let people transfer ships\decos\armors...it would be nice to let it be free but I stand my point....people have to be given a choice.

Then the Weapons would destroy the Corel, Nibelheim, Junon (Emerald Weapon) and Fort Condor reactors before going back to sleep.

Rufus, if still alive after Midgar AND Junon got fucked up, takes over Shinra and decides that he's noping out of Mako exploitation and looking to keep Shinra on top through other means, leading to new sources of energy. 

If Reeve survives Midgar destruction too, then we're looking at a world similar to Advent Children world : humanity is rebuilding and looking for new energy sources after a great calamity, and I'd wager that Edge would still get built.

On the other hand, we're probably looking at a world in which Hojo is still alive. The Reunion Theory worked, clones all showed up in Midgar, but then the city got blown up. So he's trying to scramble to find new mad science to do, like trying to study the Weapons. :/",1504224137

&gt; Our Lady Peace (also known as OLP) is an alternative rock band formed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1992. 

&gt; The band has sold over five million albums worldwide, won four Juno Awards, and ten MuchMusic Video Awards. OLP has released eight studio albums to date, with ""Clumsy"" often being considered the most popularized of the set. The Heavyweight Songfacts reports that their eighth studio album  Curve was recorded from 2010 through 2012 at vocalist Raine Maida's home recording studio. It was released on April 3, 2012.

&gt; Full circle: a theme that eagerly resonates with each member of multiplatinum survivors, Our Lady Peace. As the band approached the release of their seventh studio album, a feeling of renewal and excitement washed over Toronto’s favorite sons in a manner not felt since their earliest days.

&gt; Self-produced in lead singer Raine Maida’s Los Angeles home studio, the 10-track Burn Burn (in stores July 21 2009), marks the longest period between studio albums for Our Lady Peace. It also signifies a sonic and philosophical rebirth. The band now enjoys a creative and professional freedom that they haven’t experienced since the release of their now classic debut. “I think about the way we made Naveed,” Maida recalls. “We were just starting, we knew nothing about the business and we had no expectations. It was four guys in a room just trusting their instincts. We went back to that. ‘Liberating’ doesn’t really even sum it up.”

&gt; Burn Burn is a triumphant return to what Maida terms “a proper, mature rock album,” steeped in the kind of raw intensity that drove their early material. Blinding rays of anthemic light make way to the tender poise and precision of a band that was looking for a way out and found a satisfying new way in.

&gt; With caution thrown to the wind, tracks such as the stunningly arranged “Dreamland” and the overpowering first single, “All You Did Was Save My Life,” soar above angry clouds of confusion and insecurity with an ascending clarity that can only come from experience and growth.

&gt; The pounding affirmation of “The Right Stuff” and the vigilant build of band favorite “Refuge,” also reinforce the notion that OLP now occupy a unique and enviable mindspace. “We’re not looking back with any kind of regret,” Maida points out, “but we’ve been doing this long enough now that we know what we want to say. We didn’t want to compromise a thing.”

&gt; Having scattered in different directions after the release of 2005’s Healthy In Paranoid Times, all four members took on projects of their own, ranging from solo records, production and songwriting work, tours and guest performances. Over the last two years, Raine Maida, guitarist Steve Mazur, bassist Duncan Coutts and drummer Jeremy Taggart sporadically reconvened and lived at Madia’s home, creating what he calls their best effort to date.

&gt; Members would leave each session without tapes, giving themselves a much fresher perspective on the material they created when they returned. Producing themselves and an adherence to rolling tape off the floor gave birth to an urgent, natural body of work. “We didn’t put a lot of pressure on ourselves,” Coutts confirms. “We left things alone and haven't done that in a long time.""

&gt; “For us,” adds Maida, “a big part of this band is playing live. It has to be something that we’re going to enjoy; a real dynamic collection of songs. When we really started to understand that, the record took on this whole other life.”

&gt; This work ethic allowed room for guitarist Steve Mazur, who joined the band in 2002, to blossom on Burn Burn. “On this album I really felt comfortable with my role and what I sound like as the guitarist of Our Lady Peace.” Mazur shines on tracks such as “Escape Artist” and “Paper Moon,” a song where Mazur’s solowork was nailed on the first go-round.

&gt; Our Lady Peace is also striking out on their own professionally this time around, opting for what the band terms a “true partnership” with both North American record labels. “We’ve never been this prepared for an album,” adds OLP founding member Jeremy Taggart. “In the past, we’ve never had the foresight to have maybe two or three singles in the can already with videos, etc.”

&gt; “Nobody knows us better than ourselves,” Taggart continues. “We didn’t over think a good song or idea or under think anything. The good songs really picked themselves.”

Give: Darren McFadden (to the Zeke Owner)

Receive: Kareem hunt 

Is that an even trade? The Zeke suspension might be reduced from anywhere to 0-4 games IMO. Hunt might not be a RB1 and have to split with West and Spiller. 

The Hunt Owner wants me to add someone else on top of McFadden and then he might do it.

**-----**

Here are my RB and WRs:

RB: Fournette, McCaffery, Gore, Coleman, McFadden, and Jaquizz Rodgers. 

WR: Evans, Landry, Garcon, Cobb, and Zay Jones.

**-----**

Here are his RB and WRs:

RB: Cook, Hunt, CJ Anderson, Zeke (SUS 6GM), Rawls (RBBC?), Jamaal Williams, and D'onta Foreman. 

WR: AJ Green, Martavis Bryant (SUS?), Tyrell Williams, Corey Davis, and Cole Beasley.

He has 4 rookie RBs, a currently suspended Zeke, Rawls who might be in a RRBC, and CJ Anderson. His WRs don't look that Solid.

I am not knocking Mazda at all. I am brand loyal and a huge fan of Mazda for many years. I am simply saying the car would benefit from a bit more power, how much? I would think 220-230 should do it. Looking forward to the skyactiv X models to come out which will have more power. I find the Mazda 6 to be quite sluggish in its current form so i do not consider it a very spirited drive.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","With a propeller plane, you could theoretically build the engine with a reverse gear, or design the propeller to adjust the angle of its blades, so as to push the plane in reverse. I'm not sure if this is a common thing in real life, I would imagine not since it just adds weight and engineering complexity and increases the chance of something failing.

With turbojets/turbofans, you can't really do this. I suppose you could run a turbofan in reverse by rerouting power from somewhere else (e.g. a battery), but this would be terribly inefficient. Alternatively, you could build the engine to literally rotate and face backwards, but this would also add a lot of weight and engineering complexity and increase the chance of something failing. In practice, I don't think anybody does either of these things; the upshot is that jet planes are not capable of taxiing backwards under their own power.",1504224141

Played as France in 1444, and made it about 50 years (10ish hours?) and then forgot to check my growing agressive expansion after a long but successful war with the Holy Roman Empire (Austria). 

I annexed too much territory in the peace deal, which caused several neighboring countries to join a coalition war against me. 

Thought I could ward them off with a  defensive war, but it was too no avail. Forced me to release several independant nations and Austria got more of Burgundian France, including a nice new fort I had paid for.

The fuckers.

It was the first of many eu4 Iron Man pre-1500 restarts.

Hate speech and slander is that limit in this particular case. You're allowed to dislike black people and you're allowed to voice that opinion (it makes you look like an idiot but it's your right as per free speech) but you're not allowed to slander them nor do any hate speech.

The most important bit about national economies, spending and debt that people rarely grasp is the fact that government spending is a huge factor in keeping one's economy running and due to this internal feedback loop lowering the spending too fast may actually result in increased debt due to lower income caused by slowed economy because of the lower government spending. 

The way to go about it is, as suggested by Keynesians, to freeze or lower the spending in times of prosperity to lower debt while increasing it significantly by borrowing when the economy falls into recession.

Regarding your self-examination, this is something very few people learn, let alone are interested in.  There is hardly an endeavor more worthy than learning to understand ourselves and becoming more self-aware, emotionally intelligent, and of high character.  

I'd like to leave you with a quote my uncle passed on to me regarding this subject.  It is from Socrates:

""The unexamined life is not worth living.""

I've learned that this means a life that isn't thought about carefully becomes one of little value (not worth living).  

If you want a life of value, examine yourself.  You'll never regret it.  It's the only way to have true peace and satisfaction, when everything you do is done because you know, with logical reasons, why you are doing something.  It gives you purpose and your life meaning.

"AbandonedPorn","t5_2sh6t","**Pocono Mountains**

The Pocono Mountains, commonly referred to as the Poconos, is a geographical, geological, and cultural region in Northeastern Pennsylvania, United States. The Poconos are an upland of the larger Allegheny Plateau. Forming a 2,400-square-mile (6,200 km2) escarpment overlooking the Delaware River and Delaware Water Gap to the east, the mountains are bordered on the north by Lake Wallenpaupack, on the west by the Wyoming Valley and the Coal Region, and to the south by the Lehigh Valley. It comes from the Munsee word Pokawachne, which means ""Creek Between Two Hills."" Much of the Poconos region lies within the Greater New York-Newark, NY-NJ-CT-PA Combined Statistical Area.

I used to do drugs a lot more often but nowadays I trip maybe 4 or 5 times a year, smoke weed maybe once a week and MDMA every few months.

I might seem really motivated and well organised from my long list of sports and hobbies but I can be pretty lazy at times. I wouldn't say I'm a burnt out druggie though.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","One of the more surprising things you pick up after spending a good stretch of time looking at the histories of passenger shipping back and forth across the Atlantic is the short lifespans of the ships, even before taking into account the ones which were destroyed in the world wars. 

Of the ships involved in the Canadian transatlantic immigration lines (and almost all of those also went on to New York after they were done with Halifax), astonishingly few had more than twenty or twenty-five years in them before wear and tear took too much of a toll to be worth repairing. When *Aquitania* was retired in 1949 - after 35 years in service - she was very much an elderly ship and described as such by the press at the time. It's more likely than not that she would have been retired before that were it not for the transportation demands of the postwar displaced persons and war brides movements. 

Some of the exceptions are neat. The old MS *Stockholm*, launched in 1948, probably best known for sinking the *Andrea Doria* in a 1956 collision, is not only still around but still *sailing*! She went through a bazillion separate owners and names, as well as multiple refits, and is currently operating as *Astoria* as a cruise ship for one of the small independent cruise lines. She's among the last tiny handful of survivors from the age of transatlantic immigration that's still under power.",1504224154

Look at the children who are left in orphanages with no love, they self destruct. Self destruction is a reaction to negative experiences, if you are not given healthy positive love, people naturally self destruct.

It's hard enough to homogeneously mix normal fentanyl into a powder or batch of heroin, so it would be pretty tricky to do it with carfentanyl. Of course, fentanyl does appear in a lot of their #4, hence the fatal OD rate.

 Anyway, this thread was basically another dick-swinging, anti-Yank post showing how hardcore us Brits are. I was just thinking that Americans could claim to be more savage with their ridiculous heroin epidemic.

MEC allows you to open your radiators more while you are using WEP. Normally, when you WEP, your temperatures will go into orange after a few mins, but if you open the radiators more, you can WEP up to 6000m or so after take off before temps turn red.

It's made a huge difference for me, I can now outclimb spitfires and I'm learning to use it in dogfights as well. If a spit is on my tail, I put on WEP, open the radiators and point the nose at ~20 degrees. The spits can't keep up. They can still outrun you in a straight line though, also don't keep radiators at 100% all the time, above 350kph I turn them back to auto because they create drag which stops you from reaching high speed quickly.

"ELATeachers","t5_2vvc8","I am a teacher. I just received my master's certification. I've got great recommendations from supervisors and student-teacher practitioners. I had a 3.9 GPA. I've done my best to apply to any teaching position out there. The only thing I'm lacking is experience. That's what I'm hoping to get with this job so I can have my own classroom. 

I was a long-term sub for one semester at a high school in the spring. That teacher gave me an incredible amount of autonomy, and I loved it. This new sub job couldn't be any more different than what I had done before. I was taken aback by the level of control this teacher wants because the former teacher I subbed for hardly asked for any. 

Of course I'm a bit disappointed that I can't be as independent as I was before. But I never said I wasn't going to teach her plans or do what the teacher asked. I plan on following her directions the very best I can. 

Try going from one job where you had almost complete independence and autonomy to another one in which you didn't. Perhaps I was a bit naive to think that this teacher would be similar to the previous one. But I'm a new teacher, so I'm new to all of this. ",1504224158

I started to stay away from Lucky Punch, and then Miracle Punch, the moment I felt it was missing more than it was hitting, honestly. Felt too risky, hoping for it to hit and for it to crit, so I stayed away. And yeah, figures Mona is better on Normal, but I only played on Hard and his low HP/Endurance had him getting KO'd way too frequently.

I don't mean they should map out abilities up to lv99, mind you. Just that the game should give you more to play through after you do get to lv75. Like, if the game was scaled so that you were meant to be lv75 when you **started** Mementos Depths instead, it would give more time to spend with the fully decked out party members. Hell, I think I wouldn't have even been lv75 if I hadn't stopped to grind for money to fill up my compendium right before fighting Yaldabaoth.

Funny thing about the twins, I tried to take them on solo after fusing Satanael to see what's up and got crit'd and AoA'd on the first turn. Their AoA is pretty cool so I wasn't even mad, just like the big Okumura robot nuking my party after saying ""WITNESS THE TRUE POWER OF NOM!""",1504224158

So when they see comments on it they want to talk about how it works just fine for them. And older men get sick of being told they are creepy just for being into young guys. Which is understandable because who doesn't like young guys? However, the thread I was talking about was specifically about young guys feeling pressured when they don't want it.

And I understand the mindset that leads people to be defensive when their sexual choices are called out. As I'm sure most gay guys do because we are all used to it. I think the problem with the whole bareback sex issue is people simply look at it as ""Well I know I'm taking a risk but that's my decision."" Now if it began and ended there I would agree. But it doesn't. It increases the risk for everyone in the community. Even those who use protection methods since none are 100%.",1504224161

A 2 month wait is not enough for any reasonable person to buy 2 copies of a game, as well as most players who play on PC, don't use their console (if they have one) as anything other than a Netflix box. Also the fact that they design these games on PCs means actually nothing, you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. The framework for designing a game for a console and PC is radically different, that's a fact, do some research. If 2 months means we don't get another Batman Arkham Knight level port, I'm happy.

evidence?

This is a contradictory claim. To lie is to knowingly state something that is false. If you take someone's word as gospel, you might repeat it and say something that is false but by definition you don't actually know it's false, so you can't be said to be lying.

Evidence?

&gt;They have stated that Russia had nothing to do with it.

And what is your evidence that they know this is true?

So? Can you name 1 time that I've been proven wrong? No? Then everything I say must be true. Things are true or false because of supporting or contradicting evidence, not because you just like the person making the claim.

Your belief sounds more and more like a house of cards built on other beliefs that come from a pro-Trump echo chamber. It's telling that early on in your post you use these words-

&gt;After doing my own research, and *thinking for myself,*

You've set out to imply that anyone who doesn't follow your opinion isn't thinking for themselves. This isn't about following the evidence wherever it might lead for you, it's about saying the words that make you feel good about yourself and imagine everyone who doesn't believe you is intellectually lesser.

Sure, but this doesn't mean feminism takes into account the male perspective or works on men's issues.  This is just overlap.

Yes, history is male dominated.  But as things are changing now in the direction of equality, we can't ignore the places where men don't get equal treatment.  And feminism ignores those things.  

My voice wasn't generally accepted on the basis that I am a male.  That alone is used as a reason why any disagreement can be simply discarded: you are a man and so you don't get it, your opinion is therefore meaningless.  I support feminism, or at least some parts/definitions of it, but I absolutely believe it is a driven from a female perspective and focuses on female issues.  To me, equality encompasses both male and female issues.  Just because males have held a dominant position doesn't mean we should swing the pendulum the other way and ignore them/deny them a voice which is inherent in feminism.   ",1504224163

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","NEW APP IN NC ALLOWS MINORS TO ORDER BIRTH CONTROL ONLINE WITHOUT PARENTS KNOWING
CHARLOTTE, NC -- Women and girls as young as 13 years old can now get birth control online in North Carolina, without going to the doctor or requiring parental consent.
 
CHARLOTTE, NC -- Women and girls as young as 13 years old can now get birth control online in North Carolina, without going to the doctor or requiring parental consent.

The birth control delivery app, Nurx, was recently launched in our state and is already causing controversy.

“We just have so much evidence that young people are having sex whether we want them to or not,” said Dr. Jessica Knox, medical director for Nurx.

“We have younger patients who haven't been able to access birth control otherwise because their parents aren't comfortable talking about birth control with them,"" Dr. Knox said. ""So they won't take them to the doctor’s office.”

It doesn’t cost anything to use, you just answer a few medical questions inside the app.

The request is then reviewed online by medical professionals like Dr. Knox.

“And then information goes to a clinician who is licensed in that patients’ state,” Dr. Knox explained.

The birth control is then shipped for free right to the patient’s door. The cost of the birth control is the same as what you’d pay for at a pharmacy.

If you don’t have insurance, prices start at $15 a month.

That’s the part that’s not sitting well with some people; minors are now able to get a prescription without a doctor’s appointment, and without mom and dad ever knowing.

“When young people can't access the service is it doesn't mean they're not having sex,” Knox argued. “It just means they're having sex in a way that might not be as safe.”

The NC Values Coalition disagrees, telling us in a statement:

Nurx is dangerous, because it provides another way for children under the age of 18 to obtain contraceptives without the knowledge or consent of their parents. In North Carolina, contraceptives can only be administered by obtaining a prescription from a licensed physician, so Nurx must utilize telemedicine (the practice of doctors seeing patients online through teleconferencing). Legislation passed this year (HB 283) [that] requires the state to study how to regulate telemedicine, and NC Values Coalition will certainly be advocating for legislators to prohibit the use of telemedicine by minors to obtain contraception.
Regardless, experts warn apps like this should not replace your ""real-life"" doctor.

“STI screening or HIV testing, pap [smears], breast and chest exams those things aren't available through apps,” clinic director Erin Wilkins said. “So we definitely recommend that people still get their annual check up.”",1504224164

Steak as most people understand it is lean muscle tissue, and muscular fat with a small amount of connective tissue.

On top of that, the hearts there are repeatable, and there are bounties to take out if you want to sort of free-form monster hunt with whoever else is in the map. In addition to random events that can pop up, the hearts, and the bounties, you can also run into pretty challenging creatures, like the hydras and the sand sharks, which are just plain fun to fight!

The new locations are super unique and interesting, and I have a feeling you'll really enjoy unlocking mounts as a circumstance of wandering around these new maps and playing the new content. If you like running around and doing whatever you want, then get ready to run faster, jump higher, do all kinds of stunts on the back of a cool dog, and float over water.

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","Alcohol tolerance works exactly the same as THC tolerance. 0.08 BAC is about 4-5 drinks, regardless of tolerance. It takes more and more alcohol to get your drunk, the more you often you get drunk. 

My uncle would drink a fifth of vodka every night to get drunk, I sincerely doubt 4-5 shots would make him anything more than buzzed, he probably would have been fine to drive. He'd remember the conversation he had with me that night after a fifth. If I had a fifth of vodka, I'd either black out or end up in the hospital. 

Anyway, the fucker didn't drink and drive but he passed away from cirrhosis, so don't do that I guess.

&gt;Now imagine after a few blunts with my friends how many days do I have to wait before I can drive again?

That's not how it works. All THC will be eliminated in 8-12 hours and you won't test for it. Things are eliminated from your blood at half-life periods. Because at each half-life the THC level is divided in half, it doesn't really matter how much you smoke, because it will still get eliminated logarithmically. Like if you smoke twice as much as me, it still adds only 1 half-life to your total elimination time. You might smoke 8 times as much as me (+3 HLs) but you probably don't smoke 16 times as much as me or 32 times as much. ",1504224165

1. Maybe 3-4 templates for each race city. It's just boring fighting the same thing using he same strats. Don't get me wrong, it happens every TW game.

2. They're small. Say what you want but the combat extends past walls, and it's always just the AI camping one spot. Beyond that, fighting beyond the walls is samey. Little elevation changes, cities are not unique (Tilea could have same template as reikland for example), and there are no bridges. 

3. Siege equipment is kind of pointless. You can rush walls with ladders if you have a siege attacker unit. Cav can break down gates too. 

4. Actual artillery doesn't do much against walls unless it's focus fired, and often times its faster to just break down the gate. 

5. Walls and towers just disappear after destroying them instead of crumbling like in every other TW game. 

6. Complexity of walled settlements is the same whether you're attacking a level 1 city or a level 6 city.",1504224165

The will is part of the unfolding of the world. But there's no evidence that this impedes people being able to do whatever they want.

TL;DR: Civ 6 has potential, but it's probably best to wait unless you have already tapped out on civ 4/5.",1504224168

"tf2","t5_2qka0","To be fair 2007 TF2 doesn't have airblast or building hauling and Vintage is going for a set time in TF2's history instead of the ""What if we made TF2"" route Classic is going for. It's weird how you guys bring up classic because Vintage has had problems primarily with the developers who are really upset vintage stole their remaining playerbase from them.  So far the only people who have really had anything negative to say about the mod tend to turn out to be part of the dev team's inner circlejerk and even then those people still downloaded and play Vintage because no one else is on. In fact one of the server hosts left TF2C to put up a vitnage server because no one was playing. Though he purposely left it a buggy mess to try to shunt people to classic. I dunno looking at it classic and vitnage are vying for two different routes and technically all the gamemodes classic offers are custom in TF2 and more fleshed out, Espionage is just TTT. Deathmatch is FFA Arena (which I know I'm not the only one who finds a FFA gamemode out of place in a game based around teams am I?) and their chinese bootleg of VSH.

Another Issue I know is a lot of the people playing vintage have had a sour taste left in their mouth by classic's development team. I personally remember once one of the classic devs came into a server back when a lot of us were playing classic, gave himself uber and started basically becoming ""no fun allowed"". I find it odd that people from 8chan have been so friendly as you'd figure they'd be hostile to people not part of their ""sekrit club"" but it's been fun, while vintage has it's issues it's still playable. More so than classic which seems to be unable to run certain retail TF2 maps like CP_sunshine. Funny enough even people on facepunch had positive things to say about it and you'd figure it wouldn't since that site is more or less their home turf. Still different strokes for different folks.

"overclocking","t5_2rfc8","On a technical level you are increasing the frequency of a signal extrapolated from a clock generator. This means the logic gates constructed from transistors cycle more often so the component can do more work in a given time frame.

https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/transistors

When talking about overclocking memory it isn't the actual memory chips you are increasing the speed of. What you are actually doing is modifying the memory controller that exists as part of the CPU package. Every operation done to memory is ultimately measured in clock cycles, and there are a huge amount of timings that you adjust on the controller to tune these. If the memory can't handle all the operation(s) you ask of it in that time frame you end up with unstable memory aka corrupted data.

For more information on actual circuitry I highly recommend projects such as http://nand2tetris.org/

-------

There are 3 ways to increase stability for any overclock.

1. Make the circuitry cooler. Up to a point you can lower the resistance of materials so they waste less electricity as heat. This has minimal impact until you get deep into the negative range.

2. Raise power limits. This is mostly for GPU's but CPU's, particularly in mobile devices also have current settings. By limiting current you place a cap on the wattage available to the component, so it essentially can't utilize all of its resources at once. There is a point at which raising this no longer helps, hence why a liquid nitrogen capable BIOS with a 150% power limit would provide you with negligible benefits in most cases.

3. Increase voltage. All those logic gates that are running off that aforementioned clock signal becomes unstable when you ask them to work too fast, adding more voltage to the equation raises stability. This is the biggest area where you get headroom from the factory for overclocking, at least for CPU's. Just because 95% of a chip might do frequency X at voltage Y doesn't mean they can ship products with voltage Y, they have to use voltage Z which might be 5-10% higher so that fewer working products are wasted.",1504224170

A lot of what you are saying about zoning and ""Good Ol' Boyism"" is definitely true, but you also have to realize that while the city itself is 2.2 million, the region is over 6 million.  There are probably 3+ million people worth of homes, strip malls, roads, etc. in unincorporated areas that are effectively run by HoAs and spreads into at least six counties.  Much of this development is north and west of the city proper which means all of the runoff flows right through the city.  This sprawl development is a lot more than just the city's ordinances or lack thereof.  At my house, I measured 26.5"" between Saturday and Tuesday.  That would be pretty tough for any city to handle even if ""The Heights"" were more than 22 feet above downtown and the soil wasn't all clay.

 Scrappers are a special case since the charger has a decent time halting them from range, thus giving some breathing room if needed. Shoot down the Drizzler bombs before attacking the Drizzler itself. This also may let you be in a good position to reflect kill them.

During mother's hip events, chargers (excluding e-liter) have a field day shooting down the salmonids (flying chum?) that drop boxes. This is the chargers exclusive role.

 It's obviously dangerous to run off on your own, due to the charger's lack of turfing ability, so try to stay close to another teammate.

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The devs have to reduce the Shield Oath damage penalty just to bring DPS in line with the other 2 tanks. Reason why PLD only has 15% damage penalty, compared to 20% on DRK's Grit, and 25% Defiance, is because unlike the other 2 tanks, ALL of the PLD damage abilities takes a damage penalty while in Shield Oath. 

Compare that to WAR, All of their beast gauge spenders (Inner beast, Steel Cyclone) IGNORES the Defiance damage penalty, and DRK, when you factor in the potency increase of BloodSpiller vs the Grit damage penalty, the final potency numbers are only off by 20 (30 with Dark Arts) you might as well say Grit doesn't really affect Bloodspiller either. Quietus is still penalised but you get mp back so the 20% penalty on Grit seems fair.

WARs have the 10 sec lockout, while DRK doesn't trigger the GCD while dropping Grit, it only triggers the GCD when putting up Grit, so they only use 1 GCD when swapping back and forth. In terms of DPS for WAR the 10 sec lockout is punishing enough, while DRK only uses 1 GCD for putting Grit back up, which is a lot less punishing than being forced with a 25% penalty of Defiance for 10 secs. So assuming the PLD adopts the WAR's 10 sec lockout, why is there a need to increase the damage penalty of Shield Oath when the 10 sec lockout is punishing enough as is?

In fact in it's current form, losing GCDs for both Sword and Shield Oath is the most punishing of all 3 tanks. 10 secs is 4 GCDs, and with WAR's Defiance penalty at 25%, with very very simple maths, -25% for 4 GCDs is similar to losing 1 GCD's worth of damage. DRK only use 1 GCD for putting Grit back up. Now Oath dance twice within that same 10 secs and they just lost 2 GCDs worth of damage. 

If anything, in it's current form PLD needs a buff in stance dancing because they are the most penalised for even stance dancing, whereas WARs have more CDs available compared to PLD meaning they can hold out much longer before even needing to stance dance at all.",1504224173

&gt;If that were true, no one would have depression, anxiety, OCD, etc.

How does that conclusion follow the premises you laid out? It's not logically sound.

&gt;What you're saying is irrelevant anyway, because these disorders aren't fueled by belief, they're fueled by compulsion or emotional baggage, or things of that nature.

""Compulsion or emotional baggage"" - could you be more specific? If you believe you are compelled to binge eat whenever you feel sad, then why not try telling yourself that you are *not* compelled to binge eat whenever you feel sad? Simply walk away from the food. It feels weird and unnatural going against your first instinct, it might feel hard to do the first couple times, but it's very relieving to be able to shed your previous self and move on as an improved, better person.

&gt;These disorders are the result of unhealthy feelings regarding food

These, are at their core, irrational beliefs...

again... 

&gt;maybe an obsessive desire for self-improvement.

If your desire to improve yourself is beginning to harm you, then perhaps you should reconsider your belief that you should improve yourself to such an extent. Change your behavior and you'll change your thoughts.

&gt;You're basically telling depressives to ""cheer up"" or people with OCD to ""just relax."" It doesn't work that way.

Trust me, I've been through the wringer myself. Spent several years in therapeutic rehab and suffered from some other nasty stuff for the better part of a decade. This is the only way I found that really, truly worked. Think about, and improve, each and every one of your actions - in the moment - and you will become a slightly better person every day.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Metroid: Other M, when you learn how to use the grapple. You have a cutscene where an ally is on top of a cliff in front of you, about to be slaughtered by this recurring enemy that's sort of a boss. You don't have the grapple at this point, and it's not obvious.

In front of you, there's a pool of lava, and in front of that, there's a cliff that you can't quiiiite get up. You sit there, trying over and over and over to get to the top before your ally is murdered, thinking you're doing something wrong, because you need to move.

Turns out, the correct solution is, in an action scene, to stop and look around and survey the room, in a mode where you can't move or do anything in. If you happen to look directly at the ceiling, it'll zoom in on a small spot and THEN grapple is unlocked. Once unlocked, you grapple up and save your ally.

I'm getting on for 60 now, and the family/friends split over this when I was about 25, and I still recall that hurt (it's more that I can remember being really hurt, not the hurt itself). If I'd had counselling or therapy, then maybe I'd have come to terms with it all, but it's not really available in the UK - and definitely wasn't back then.

I understand qualifying is important but when you have literally over double the points of someone and still manage to draw in the rivalry it's a little tiresome. Also it's kinda dumb that 2 of the race points are handed to them on a silver platter (finish the race/ no penalties). I'd much rather see things like Deltas in qualifying time, race time and position play more of a part. If I finish 10 positions ahead of my teammate it seems wrong that he can actually get more points than me if I get a penalty and he sets the fastest lap. ",1504224175

""The new version, the WH-1000XM2, features the same noise-cancelling tech, touch controls, ambient sound mode, custom noise cancellation settings and other handy audio tools that made the MDR-1000X so great. What's new? For starters, this model features up to 30 hours of battery life with active noise cancellation and Bluetooth turned on. That's 10 hours more than the previous unit. Sony also added a Quick Charge mode that will give you over an hour of battery with a 10-minute charge.

Thanks to the Sony Headphones Connect App, the WH-1000XM2 also offers atmospheric pressure optimization, ambient sound control, an EQ and both surround and sound position control. The best part? This new set of headphones will debut cheaper than the MDR-1000X at $350 when it arrives in September.""

There are a few different moments before muta where zerg can allin.  You just have to have good scouting.  If its super early you would notice a low drone saturation, or pulling drones off gas, or not taking a 2nd gas after lair.  It helps to have a good depot sim by your bunker so it doesn't get fully surrounded.  Seeing 8 lings is also a tell.  Losing your scv super early also ups the zergs chances of sending lings.  Generally play safe if things don't look/feel perfectly normal by 4:30.  You can put an scv outside of your base to give yourself 2-3 seconds to react if when you see lings (think of the area right outside the bridge on FS or CB).  In this time you should move your marines to your ramp, and pull scvs to wall for them.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","Keep telling yourself that there is nothing you can do to mess up the game. If the game doesn't want you to go somewhere because it's attached to a quest, it won't let you. Otherwise you can freely explore everything without worry. 

Just because you personally can't use an item from a quest doesn't mean that quest was useless. You had to use the skills you are currently building to get said item and so gaining experience for those skills as you quest.

You are going to get tons of quest markers.. That's what skyrim does. However, there's no need to follow the quest markers. (in fact that's probably the worst thing you can do.) Go where you want to go and do what you want to do. The quest markers aren't timed, they aren't going anywhere. Got a quest to go kill giants? Cool, do it when you get over that way.. don't rush off to an area you haven't been just to go kill giants. Do it when you get there in your own time. 

Explore.. These games are fun to explore and there's tons of stuff you won't ever see if all you do is bury your nose in a quest marker.  If you are confused as to where to go, download some online maps and mark off areas as you explore.. 

If the game continues to give you enough insecurity that you feel like you're messing up and need to start over, buy the official Prima Guide. You'll have all the maps, all the quests, nice reference charts for everything in the game.  Knowledge is power and the prima guide has all the knowledge.. (and some power. It's really heavy..

I'm glad someone tried to do the study you referenced, but they basically said they can't do the study because it was a study of other studies... Studies should be viewed scientifically. If you dig into what you linked (and before I try to refute what you say, let me just say that this was still a very interesting link to read), there's a lot more to be told than just the headline and abstract information:

- ""Based on limited information, we are uncertain about the effects of back protectors on spinal injuries. Further research is required to substantiate the effects of back protectors on mortality and other injuries to the back."" **Basically saying don't use this as an argument for or against spine protector effectiveness**
- The first of the 2 studies studied in this report was such a small sample it's not even worth thinking it is representative of a population
- The second looks at motorcycle and moped crashes together... but anyways at least it has a larger sample, although still statistically unlikely to represent the motorcycle riding population
- The second study includes this important bit about their 'random sampling': ""This may involve more cases where back protectors had failed to work while excluding those where back protectors proved effective.""
- Oh and it says this too: ""The study is therefore likely to underestimate any benefits of back protectors.""
- And even if those points don't dissuade you from wanting to reference this study, the overall stats for the Guistini study are:
**No back protection:** - 52 spinal injury, 293 no spinal injury (21% = spinal injury)
**Hard-shell or airbag:** - 12 spinal injury, 80 no injury (13%)

I work in statistics and this article screamed lack of scientific rigor. I'm not trying to lambaste you here, this happens ALL the time (look at all the people who say that unregistered/illegal voters influence elections - this was based on one poorly executed statistical analysis that was eventually totally disowned &amp; discredited even by the writers, but is still referenced by the highest ranking officials in America).

But I have to say after playing this beta I'm super hooked on it. I spent last night doing Crucible with a friend and we were stomping people and I finally ""got it"" the whole idea of why it even has pvp. I collected every single drop for pvp armor wise for my Hunter as well as collecting everything for pve that I could and man it was amazing. I spent one evening just exploring the strike map with a buddy and we found a way outside of the map that leads to a really cool looking anti-camber and I was just floored. Before that I spent so much time just running fast as I could to get to the boss and now I spent around 2 hours just running around the map doing fun stuff exploring. We figured out the spawn the rings fight chain with the hobgoblins to get the mini bosses to spawn and I felt so accomplished! I spent a bunch of time sitting on top one of the goals when the Farm opened just people watching and I thought to myself. This is how it used to be when I played Phantasy Star Online a bunch as a kid. A bunch of the things I enjoyed (like the soccer/football lobby) are all here to make meeting people and doing widly different things with each group possible and enjoyable.

As a former longtime staff member it's about time the shop closed. There were numerous consistent health violations and relatively poor management.

The management and one or two other staff consistently smoked in the back dock while preparing food, the lower level staff toilets+urinals were entirely nonfunctional and clogged with goop and mould for at least 4 years, the stairs were completely covered in years old bird poop, and the staff room had serious mould and rusting problems. However, the other staff by in large were indeed lovely people.

"AstralProjection","t5_2rylp","I have not been to that sub but if the group consensus there is that AP is false, I would have no use for that sub.

LD = dreaming = sleeping. In contrast, you *can* AP without sleeping before, during or after the event. They are so different experientially. That said, you can LD, then wake up enough to AP, then go back to dreaming, sleeping -- or have full wakefulness wondering what just happened.

You can also AP as part of a dream, that is probably most common. But the dream would likely be filled with symbols, and all the mishmash of dream contents -- that is if you remember the dream at all.

AP is also more closely related to Near Death Experience (NDE) than LD. This is because when the body undergoes a traumatic event, if the pain and injury are above a certain level, the person will eject from the body. They don't go to sleep and start dreaming. Medical situations like this happen all the time, and some of them involve NDE.

The book [The Self Does Not Die](https://iands.org/resources/media-resources/front-page-news/1161-the-self-does-not-die-is-now-available-on-amazon.html) is one of the best scientific collections of NDE evidence (and, for many of the cases, AP evidence).

As one of the co-authors [said](https://carlossalvarado.wordpress.com/2016/11/04/author-interview-xi-the-self-does-not-die-verified-paranormal-phenomena-from-near-death-experiences-by-titus-rivas-anny-dirven-and-rudolf-h-smit/), ""[The book contains] a whole chapter about the desperate attempts of pseudo-skeptics (or “debunkers”) to immunize their world view against this kind of evidence. They have done everything they could, but they’ve simply failed miserably. This means that materialism is not a serious theoretical option anymore for NDEs as a whole, and even deserves to be abandoned in all respects. ...

""[T]he evidence we collected, particularly concerning consciousness and veridical perception in NDEs during cardiac arrest, really leads the conclusion that there is an non-physical self that survives clinical death. It must be a personal self, which retains its consciousness, episodic and semantic memory, cognitive faculties, and psi abilities.""",1504224180

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","A religious Jewish friend of mine was a salesman and would go to people's homes. He was in a house of a Bangladeshi Muslim (or some east Asian descended) and said it was great. They bonded over religion. My friend told me that the Muslim guy was telling non canonical stories off Abraham that we have in the Jewish tradition.

Theres definitely a weariness that has been planted in people's minds. Muslims come from the middle east (that's the stereotype). The middle east is a tumultuous. Those same people are now getting spread across Europe and North America. People have a right to feel uncomfortable, yet I also realize how unrealistic it is that they the Muslim population will reach out by having some breaking bread ceremony with large cities and win hearts over. I don't have some solution that will bring everyone together, just kind of ranting.

But people saying slurs like sand n- or stereotyping all Muslims as terrorists is actual racism. I think that's different than Islamophobia because it's more of a hate than a fear. ",1504224183

Lunch was similar, but instead of oatmeal and pears it was yogurt and pears. Today was free yogurt (cost $1.50 for a two-pack at Walmart, but had $1.50 rebate from ibotta), you can do that twice in one transaction - so that's four days of free yogurt for me. But normally it's homemade yogurt from a 50 cent gallon of milk.  And I added trail mix with dried fruit and nuts.  Some days I have a microwave pumpkin pie in a mug sort of deal for lunch, with pumpkin seeds and fruit. 

Dinner tonight is leftover homemade pizza (pesto crust, free tomato from the neighbor as a thanks for giving them pears instead of tomato sauce, ground pork that I seasoned into sausage flavor, and artichoke hearts), and a giant salad with romaine lettuce, cherry tomatoes, sweet peppers, chopped pears, green olives, feta cheese, and some of the honey-chipotle cashews, dressed with a little caesar dressing mixed with balsamic vinegar and sumac.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/Snapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/snapchat/comments/1saxrg/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/Snapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Snapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSnapChat).

I'd also add that the idea of PC culture on the internet is very exagerated, for every insulted minority or lgbt person, there's at least 2 bigots, and for the three of them, there's a thousand quiet watchers who just don't care. The only time I can think of anybody being torn apart for not condemning is the recent case with Trump not condemning a Nazi rally, which is bluntly crappy on his part. 

Lastly, this isn't directed at your argument, but PC has becoem such a warped term these days.

Improved my eating habits, increased how many times I work out per week, increased my deficit and what a disappointment this all turned out to be.

#PROS:

- My cardio has improved massively 
- I've seen noticeable increases in my capabilities strength-wise. 
- I lost 1.7kg 
-Reached a miniature clothes goal (I can wear an old worn out shirt), some clothes feel a bit looser

-Got my first comments on my body today. Two people say I look better, idk if I believe them.

-My posture has improved greatly, also far less back pain when I'm sitting down. 

#CONS(?):
-I lost 1.7kg

Conclusion? I'm eating too much. I give up on all the food I love. (I mean fast food) ",1504224185

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","&gt;Did they actually mishandle it? Or did they let their true colors show a little too clearly? ""Shout your abortion"" didn't come out of nowhere - it came from a rotten culture that valorizes sin.

The ""shout your abortion"" thing was started by a couple extremist, feminist activists, and then the Democrat establishment failed to reorient the conversation back to ""safe, legal and rare"" (which is far from ideal but acknowledges that we shouldn't actively celebrate killing). I got to talk about this with a lot of progressive women during the election, and almost everyone--religious and atheists alike--gets uneasy about abortion for moral, emotional, and at least physical reasons. Most have said they'd never get one while stating that it should still be legal (there's a cognitive dissonance). Bottom line is that even progressive women understand that abortion is at the bare minimum the result of a mistake, and that shame is inherently involved. Being associated with ""shout your abortion"" could not have helped the Hillary campaign.

&gt;Well, there are a few factors here. First, at least in 2016, many Catholics who voted third party gravitated toward the ASP which is pro-life. Second, everyone knows the libertarians are not actually going to win, whereas there was a serious threat that the Democrats might win. So it's easier to see voting libertarian or whatever as a vague protest than an actual support for a political enemy that might realistically win.

If someone voted for ASP and the Democratic candidate ended up beating the Republican candidate by a slim margin, do you think the ASP voter bears any culpability? My take is that they were voting with the right intentions, so they wouldn't. I'd extend that intentionality to some Democrats too. If a Democrat was too convicted about the importance of social services for the poor/healthcare to vote third party and had too many ""morally grave considerations"" to vote for a leader like Trump, then perhaps primacy of conscience would justify their choice to vote for the pro-choice party. The Church and USCCB left the definition of ""morally grave considerations"" vague enough that we could argue in circles all day about what is justified.

&gt;One would think that we would not support a pro-slavery party if the slavery rate happened to drop under them

To extend the analogy, slavery was outlawed west of the Mississippi and throughout most of the Northern states for decades before the 13th amendment was passed. 57% of Americans today still thinks abortion should be legal in all or most cases. I think there is culturally a lot more to be done until we can start talking about a Supreme Court ruling to overturn Planned Parenthood v. Casey or Roe (and even then abortion will just be remanded to the states). I think that cultural shift needs to involve leftist principles (government provisions for children and families in poverty, universal healthcare) as much as it needs to involve Republican principles (personal responsibility). I think reducing the abortion rate helps contribute to the cultural shift by helping people visualize a world without it, and I worry that Republicans' well-intentioned, piecemeal approaches to limiting abortion on the state level may be one step forward, two steps back right now--not many more abortions are prevented, but the Democrats get riled up and insist on making ""women's rights"" focal to everything instead of thinking more holistically and letting moderate Democrats have a stronger voice in the party. That's just my take. Ends don't justify means in Catholic morality, but voting Republican entails more than just daydreaming about a Supreme Court stacked with Scalias.

"crusadersquest","t5_351ir","&gt; **Threat At The Back**

I don't know what I expected from a Special Skill named ""Threat At The Back"", but yep, it only targets the back. The ""Boomerang"" doesn't deal damage when thrown, only when it reaches the apex of its throw  -- which of course means that its only hitting the backline, and with a very narrow hitbox to boot. Also, it does deal damage when it flies back to the Archer, but it has a set-distance, so it'll usually disappear before reaching the Archer. Overall, Threat At The Back is wildly inaccurate and unreliable.

When you've got other Archer Skills like Voice Of The Spirit, Fire Rain, or Blitz that can more accurately target the Backline, Threat At The Back really falls short.

A quick-fix is to allow Threat At The Back to hit enemies when thrown. But even then that won't do much.

Honestly, the only reason it's used is because it can Generate 1 Block, and that would be better attached to another Archer Special Skill.

Speaking of...

&gt; **Float Like A Butterfly, Sting Like A Bee!**

A perfect candidate for an unobtrusive Block Generation Special Skill.

Barring that, FLABSLAB's ""The Next 2 Skills Have Increased Critical Chance"" is really gimmicky, and it should just be a generic but useful Critical Chance and/or Critical Damage Buff.",1504224188
"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Practice and genetics.

People can get used to sleeping very little. When I was younger (ages 4-28), I routinely slept about 2-3 hours a night, and would often go days without sleep. My parents were quite concerned. When I did get sleep after days without, I would sleep for 5-6 hours. I functioned quite well, although I was always tired and had little energy. Didn't cause problems with school or work most of the time. 

About 2 years ago (I'm 30 now), I started taking sleeping medications to help get restful sleep after some particularly bad few months of going anywhere from 2-4 days without sleep at a time. Now, I get anywhere from 7-10 hours of sleep regularly, and on the occasions that I don't, I feel like a damned zombie. 

On the genetic side of things, my father, his father, my brother, and my grandfather on my mother's side were/are all insomniacs as well. It may well be a genetic trait that was passed down that helped me cope with the lack of sleep.

Keep in mind, though, that chronic insomnia is a pretty serious medical issue. It can have repercussions that aren't evident to the insomniac. Weakened immune systems, weight gain or loss, depression, anxiety, paranoia, dementia, memory issues... the list really does go on and on, and the symptoms are often attributed to other lifestyle/physiological issues.

Backtalk is a pretty cool mechanic. It's like a simplified conversation battle from say, Deus Ex.

The new post-rock soundtrack style fits really well imo.

Some of Chloe's diary entries are on point, such as her description of Nathan as a weird little dude trying to figure himself out.

There's a few Blade Runner references (Chloe touches herself to Pris apparently) and as a big fan of Blade Runner I appreciate it.

I love Samantha. I will fight for her. 

I'm 90% sure Big McHugeBalls is an MST3K reference. 

I feel like there's a significant lack of threat in choices because unless this is secretly an alt-universe, I know Chloe is gonna be fine.

I still really don't like Chloe's general personality at all. Sometimes her guard comes down and I can relate/sympathise with her but in general she just grinds my fuckin' gears.

The Tabletop sequence is amazing. Even if Chloe plays an Elf Barbarian because everyone knows Elves are archers.

Even if you have compatible RAM and a bunch of drives, if there are only 2 slots that's gonna limit. If you don't have these components already, you need to budget for those too. 

At your budget you're not looking at a custom build unless you have a ton of parts already (which you would've mentioned), so I'd go with an older workstation.  

Common workstation models in that price range are the Dell T3500 or T3600 series and the equivalent HP models (hopefully someone can chime in with the exact models). Another option is Lenovo ThinkStations, but whenever I've looked they've been relatively more expensive for similar specs (perhaps because there are fewer coming off lease at the same time?). 

As with all things computers, the older model is cheaper and will be easier to get with RAM/disks included for your budget, while the newer version will be more performant and possibly have more capacity for expansion, as well as being slightly more ""futureproof"", i.e. theoretically having a marginally longer working life after purchasing (at the current date/age).

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","&gt;Thanks for posting.

Sure thing. I think we talked in another post about this too.

I had a terrible childhood, and I just want to do everything I can to keep other kids from needlessly suffering through it, and then have to deal with the repercussions as an adult too. Kids can be hurt more than physically, pretty easily in fact.

&gt;We've been talking about a point system today that he is helping to come up with and he seems excited about it. We visited the school playground today (school hasn't started yet).

That's a really good idea. It's also probably beneficial to introduce it to him early so he knows what to expect. Maybe go a few more times before school starts too, and keep making sure he understands the point system too.

&gt;He will grow out of a lot of this (I did). My parents tried some of the more extreme methods and I don't talk to them now.

Yeah, that's what happened with me. I do talk to my parents now, but I didn't talk to my dad for a bit, and we have an extremely strained relationship (though I doubt he knows that) based on things I doubt I'll ever forgive.

What really sucks is that as a child, all I could do was have meltdowns, and my parents didn't know why, and I couldn't articulate it, especially in the moment. So they chalked it up to ""willfulness"" and ""misbehavior"" and I trusted them less and less, to the point where I was basically resolved to be on my own because I couldn't depend on anyone. I didn't trust any adults, and I was constantly anxious and on edge and had no idea how to fix it. I'm glad you won't send your son down that path; I could have been spared a lot of anguish had my parents not reacted the way they did.",1504224193

Things like Cutter saying that some nights it seems that he doesn't get it isn't any different from inconsistencies I've seen in people I know and work with. After seeing the movie multiple times and reading the book and script I just don't see anything that really points to a skill gap between the brothers. 

Even with the knot, the one that ties it the night Julia dies was going to tie the knot that Cutter wants but Julia indicates that he should switch to the other one. If it were really just his lack of skill or his arrogance he would have gone for that one from the start. ",1504224193

"Maplestory","t5_2rrdo","I don't know a single one of those classes that actually consistently wipes a Frenzied map in less than 2s. I/L Ice Age has plenty of cooldown and isn't up for even close to 100% of the time. DS does not clear maps larger than CLP in less than 2s. Evan definitely doesn't wipe a map in less than 2s. Cannoneer is god awful at any map that isn't just a bunch of horizontal platforms. Lumis again, don't have even close to 100% uptime on their map clear, and same with BW unless you're hacking with FMA. Kannas have trash mobbing unless they have Spirit Domain up, which again isn't even close to 100% uptime.

In pretty much any case where a class can wipe a map it has to be at a CLP or smaller map and usually requires skills that aren't up 100% of the time. There are many other Arcana maps that are equally good but are larger where none of those classes unless they're hacking can wipe maps in less than 2s.",1504224194

How is this any different since WoL? The MSC photon overcharge is the most crutch ability for all of Protoss.  I'm all for buffing gateway units even more to make defense more viable in the early game. Ex: make stalkers cheaper; put charge on Cyber core or forge; give adepts a hellion-like attack to shoot through a target up to 2-3 range; give the sentry some raven-like abilities that reduce armor or cancel abilities or buff hallucinations.

Arguing semantics is one thing, but this is just ridiculous.

As was pointed out, the backdoor was invented during a time where players were not randomly picked for veto. This way you could ensure your target didn't play. Now you can't ensure that without some kind of twist or by luck.

So technically there is no such thing as a backdoor because the conditions under which it was created are no longer present? Not quite. Things change.

To further my point, when Jon placed Arlie on the block, that was a backdoor. Arlie played in the veto but had no idea he was going up due to the last minute change in plans from Jon/Neda.",1504224197

Sanwa sticks only have two mounting points on their offset model, which is kind of weak.  Either that or I'd have to add about 1/2"" to the height of the body to accommodate the flat mounted stick.

Sanwa screw buttons are also, for whatever reason, really short, so I can only barely get the nut to thread to hold the button in place.

As for actually using them, I don't really see an appreciable difference between the two, they share threading for the ball top, and they both have the same gate options if you want something other than square.

The only thing that sucks is that the PS4 PCB is pretty expensive and along with all of the extra buttons it's going to add a lot to the cost.  Probably $60 or so.  Dunno if that's getting into a crazy range for this kind of thing or not.",1504224197

It may send the message that he is able to opt out of the consequences of his actions whenever it is sufficiently important to him, therefore the real message becomes: there are no real consequences for people like him.  And, do you truly believe that if he lost this internship he wouldn't make something of himself?  Surely, if it was so prestigious (a ""plum"" internship, as it was described), many of his classmates did not receive such an internship.  Are you suggesting that they, not having that opportunity, don't have a good chance to make something of themselves? 

It also comes down to the fact that ultimately we all must be responsible for our behaviour.  And sometimes that means that it might cost us more than we were prepared to lose.  What he did...I don't think it should cost him everything, which is why I largely agreed with his sentence.  But I don't agree with shielding him from the natural consequences of his actions - we all need to learn to be responsible and face the consequences of our actions, even when they really suck.  Anyone else would have had to face up to their employer and risk losing that position.  I'm sure it wouldn't have been the end of his chances to live a productive life (as someone who is entering a licensed profession, I should let you know that in other professions such ""mistakes"" can lose you far more than a mere internship opportunity).",1504224198

"Veterans","t5_2rc75","Just some quick searches for you:

Malignant cancer is rated 100% while it is active. This 100% rating will continue for the first 6 months after the last treatment. The condition will then be reevaluated. If it is no longer active, then it is rated on any lasting symptoms like a benign condition.

Code 7524: If both testicles are removed, it is rated 30%. If only one testicle is removed, it is rated 0%. There are a few conditions for this code. If the testicle was removed because it was not fully developed or did not descend, then it is not ratable since this is a pre-existing condition and not directly related to military service. If the testicle had to be removed because of an injury or condition that is related to military service, and the remaining testicle is not functioning (whether or not it is related to service), it is rated 30%.

So I guess it depends on if your cancer is completely gone, and if you still have your testes or not.

I love the kick/trap hybrid. It's not exactly fully martial arts, but you max dragon talon for all close quarters stuff. You'll love the help you get from Death Sentry when it clears a whole room for you. Basically dragon talon gets the first mob and death sentry does the rest. 

You can ignore the rift scepter and use a ""black"" Flail. Shouldn't be hard to get the runes Thul io nef from some countess runs. Black gives you the crushing blow that will make dragon talon quite useful. You can even buy a 3os flail from a merchant in normal. 

You'll need to get an upped pair of goreriders or goblin toe boots to do well in chaos/hell cow runs. Might be the most expensive item in the build. You can go without upping them but the dmg is needed for hell. I prefer goblin toe for the CB. They are also cheaper. 

Also, most expensive item in the list is the Dracs gloves. The lifetap will save your ass again and again. 

Look to get as much crushing blow as possible. That way you will kill enemies quickly. 

This setup would do ok without being crazy expensive

Guilliames Face helm
Black Flail
Smoke runeword armor/Duress when you can afford. 
Stormshield 
Tgods belt 
Dracs 
Goblin toe/gores

Cats eye amulet/highlords when you can afford 
Life leech ring 
Raven frost (cannot be frozen is helpful)

Merc- I liked act 2 NM offensive. The might is helpful. I think holy freeze mercs are really only good for hammerdins. Just my opinion. 

I used an insight merc bc this build is mana heavy. I'm sure there are better options. 

Tals helm (best cheap option)/vamp gaze/andys
Smoke/treachery armor
Insight CV 

Hope this helps!

"GodhoodWB","t5_38qfi","&gt;What are the various animal schools? They can be listed in movements societies as only some of them as independent nations.

Animal Schools started as School for Hunting, but then all evolved differently into something more akin to martial arts and/or moral doctrines. They all take inspiration from the traits of the Animal they take their name from.

#####School of the Lion

**Location**: Corlitia

**Affiliation**: Corlitia

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Strength, Courage, Pride

**Description**: They form the elite forces of the Corlitian army. They are bound by hounor to never flee, and are experts in using their weapons not just skillfully, but also ferociously. They believe themselves the best,  and are tought to believe it so, even, so that they won't fear anything. Also it makes for great taunts.

#####School of the Hork

**Location**: Corlitia

**Affiliation**: Corlitia

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Resilience, Defensiveness, Stubbornness

**Description**: They are walking mountains of muscles in heavy armour. They are trained to protect. They act as bodyguards, guards, and heavy defensive units in the Corlitian army. They have an almost scary relationship with their shields. It is said to be easier to take them down (which is extremely hard) than it is to convince them to take some time off, or disobey orders.

#####School of the Iqa

**Location**: Liopas

**Affiliation**: Corlitia

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Speed, Impulsiveness, Beauty

**Description**: Explorers, messengers, light cavalry, they are very versatile riders. They are the the Animal School that wasn't born for hunting, but for riding. On top of their skill on an Iqa, they pride themselves on how well groomed they and their mounts are, and have by fair the most dashing uniforms, as well as most beautiful decorations for the Iqas, while never actually armoring them or themselves. They are great tactical thinkers, which makes them particularly good individually, giving them an edge in a chaotic skirmish.

#####School of the Crane

**Location**: Relict's Shore

**Affiliation**: Relica

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Precision, Skill, Fussiness

**Description**: the finest archers in West of the lake. And likely east if it too. They also get the finest bows in the world, given Relica people's bowmaking skills. They are precise, fast, and meticulously careful about their equipment and themselves. They do not like the lesser bowmen at all.

#####School of the Duffle

**Location**: Relict's Shore

**Affiliation**: Relica (...?)

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Furtivity, Evasiveness, Seclusiveness

**Description**: They are masters of stealth, and have become spies, assassins and infiltrators for the Reliman, though no one is sure if they have no hidden agenda, but many suspect it. They also work as effective flankers, but only in short engagements. They can also sabotage or otherwise inconvenience an enemy or adversary. They tend to keep to themselves, so if they are sighted, it is unlikely it's for a nice reason.

#####School of the Goat

**Location**: Hokidudar

**Affiliation**: none

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Docility, Patience, Idleness

**Description**: they are neither warriors nor hunters, but goat ranchers. They are known for being well versed in philosophy, and spending long times in meditation, prayer, and connecting with nature. People flock to their School/Temple to hear the counsel of their wise elders.

#####School of the Vampire Fish

**Location**: Zaned

**Affiliation**: Relica

**Symbol**: *to be drawn, add this placeholder text to the wiki*

**Traits of the animal**: Sapping, Elusiveness, Meanness

**Description**: These cruel fishermen form up the first effective navy of Relica, since before a time when a navy was even contemplated. Both at sea and on land, they are warriors and archers expert at dodging, who try to tire their adversary through taunts, feints, and swift small strikes, only to then down them easily. They do not hesitate in using the cruellest tactics.

Ideally, you want 1-3 AP items but full tank is still viable as boring as it is. DFT and CotC are equally strong IMO, with stoneborn being in 3rd place. 

This korean master has even gone back to Ankans stoneborn build (idk if ankan was the 1st to do it or not). He's currently 21-8 in his last 29 games with stoneborn (I subtracted the DFT games). Of course this build is reliant on your team/adc and is better in diamond+.

If someone openly demeans, harasses, or insults his coworkers; he should be fired. The ideological content of his speech should not be the grounds for termination, but he should make sure that his co-workers are entitled to a comfortable work environment.

In my opinion, achieving this comes down more to social skills and empathy than ideology. You shouldn't touch on subjects that you realize could make others uncomfortable, especially when you're working together on a team.",1504224204

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; What do you guys think?

You raise some good points. In the early days, many new users thought that Bitcoin would become some kind of alternative Visa system. It turns out that Bitcoin can't compete on that playing field because centralized systems will always win. They scale better, both in terms of volume and number of users. They can be upgraded more quickly. They play well with the banking system.

I think a lot of the disappointment has to do with people not understanding what Bitcoin is. And you can only really understand that by watching how people actually use Bitcoin, rather than listening to what they say they'll use it for.

So here are some thoughts:

1. financial speculation is a use case;
2. censorship-resistant money (think civil asset forfeiture, for example) is a use case;
3. borderless transfer of value is a use case;
4. black market workarounds encompass many use cases;
5. hedging against inflation and other economic shocks is a massive use case;
5. Bitcoin isn't finished being created yet.",1504224206

I did read my own link. That's why I know the number of Syrians does not represent the majority of those seeking asylum. 

&gt;I am not advocating for regime change at the moment.

Ohhhh so you're just very anti Assad and advocating for intervention for the fun of it. 

&gt;Nationalism is cancer in Europe

Why?

&gt;If your narrative was correct we would see Libyans flooding into Europe after Gaddafi was overthrown, yet we don't see that. The issue is with isolationists and non-interventionists like you. Right now Europe/NATO should have command centers ON LIBYAN SOIL acting as a buffer. But non-interventionist types always talk about ""mind our own business"" which is BS in the 21st century. It's a backwards thinking for backwards people.

Backwards thinking? I'm pretty sure Europeans have been intervening everywhere for the last few centuries. Interventionism is the norm and everyone seems to think it fucks everything up.

But hey man, if we're going to intervene lets do it right. Complete colonial administration. These places will be provinces in our European empire. States set up as buffer zones to for the sole purpose of mother Europe from the hordes trying to leach off European welfare. These people have proven themselves incapable of governing their own nations, so colonial administration would be best.

I honestly think all of Africa would be better off under colonial rule. So long as we are not letting them come here, and there is a net financial positive to us, I am on board with interventionism to a degree which would make you look like an isolationist.  However, absent of the type of intervention these shitholes actually need to sort them out, we are just setting fire to money, and migrants being our chief concern, the most cost effective solution is bullets. 


&gt;You seem to be infatuated with Assad though.

You keep saying this despite my only defense of him being that he's preferable to Islamic theocracy. Honestly, you've said it more than once as if gone on about how fabulous life was under Assad. Is it hard for you to believe I just don't care if middle eastern dictators are gassing people or killing rebels? To throw it back at you, you seem very, very anti Assad. Enough to make me think you have an ideological dog in this fight. Are you a Muslim from some rival sect. Are you Jewish? Both of those would explain your hard on for intervention.

&gt;Even if you want to advocate a Europe first policy you should couple it or supplement it with an effective proactive foreign policy.

European Empire, lets go. If you want intervention let's not fuck about. You want to solve the problem once and for all? Total mobilization. Steamroll these nations, massacre all who stand against us,  subjugate the survivors, set up systems that bring civilisation to the savages. Like Caesar in Gaul. History will thank us for it.

It takes like five minutes to check the vehicle with the proper equipment, if you actually know what you are doing. That sort of repair should be done in a couple of hours, maybe one day. NOT a week+, and holding your vehicle over the holiday weekend. That's just criminal! :)

$345 for a starter is ridiculous. I don't recall even the V-6 4WD being a notably difficult job. Assuming it's a Lester #16817 family starter, Autozone retails those for like $70. Any shop that does any kind of volume shouldn't be paying more than 70% retail for their parts. Even if they jacked the part up to $200, that's still $145 in labor... On the other hand, there was a tow involved. So, how much was for the repair, and how much was for the tow?

"videography","t5_2qwgz","Thanks so much for taking a look, I completely missed that I'd gotten a response!

I really appreciate the feedback and you're absolutely right on with the critiques. Continuity was actually one of the reasons we went back a second time to shoot and we were able to fix a couple shots but still managed to get it a bit wrong hah. 

The camera direction was a bit of a problem because the person I had operating the camera (as I'm the tall guy running in the shot) had never shot anything before least of all used a stabilizer. I think both times it gets weird are because of the straps on my camera getting caught on the handle. We didn't have time to go back and redo it sadly as we'd lost most of our light.

Some running close ups and better action shots on the fence hopping scene would've been great and made a somewhat awkward scene look better and led to my realization in the edit that some additional medium close ups and close ups are almost always useful and I plan on utilizing them a lot more in the future as well as getting more time for the entire shoot.

Again, thanks for the thoughtful critiques. You've hit on several things that I need to keep more vigilant about and I think it will help me greatly on my next shoot!",1504224211

These articles that are critical of her also do a great job of showing that she has made mistakes as a young politican and later changed/corrected her stances. That's something I like, though at the same time will remain aware of, if she does run. (I'd love to see her giving debate responses to some of these issues.)          
         
The articles are also wary of her stances on Islamic terrorism and foreign policy (while admitting she has firsthand experience in the middle East) and express a distaste that some on the right actually like her (for the right or wrong reasons). Those points, in a way, amount to a positive for me, because I'd like to see a candidate dragging independants, and what sane republicans are left, toward progressivism. I have no illusions about it being a slow process.

"Heroclix","t5_2sec4","I recommend to go get a Thor Starter set as well. Just FYI, in the past  few months there have been a few Marvel sets.

 ""The Mighty Thor"" Just came out yesterday. Which has lots of great figures.The common and uncommons are super good, as  the R,SR &amp; Chase will have you want to collect them all. Plus SUPER BOOSTERS!!!. 

""What If"" a fun set and has some amazing figures too.Down side though, they reuse a lot of sculpts in the set. Which is a bit disappointing. I'd recommend buying a maybe a few boosters to see if you can pull a SR. If not I say buy or trade online for them. FYI: Beware the Goblin King. if you pull him. dont let go of him. 

""Avengers Defenders War"" Another Good Set that has excellent figures. I personally enjoyed all the figures in this set. The Chases are spectacular, as well all the other figures. The Punisher common piece is just bananas.

""Deadpool and the X-Force"" Great set with lots of variety, I didnt go too crazy for this set but if you're a fan of Deadpool or X-Factor/Men I recommend looking into it.  Also, there is an Ultra Chase. 

That sums it up for the Marvel sets. If you like to look into the sets and figures. I'd recommend going to HCrealms.com and go to the ""UNIT"" section. from there you can see all the sets with their dials and abilities. Just so you can get an idea on what to invest your money into.

&gt;
&gt;There's a girl at my nearby coffee shop.  She and I have been talking for a few months but I've never gotten the nerve to ask her for her number.
&gt;
&gt;So I read online that it might be easier handing the girl your number, since she's working.  It shouldn't make a scene and would be pretty easy to act like it never happened if she doesn't text me. 
&gt;
&gt;I go into the store and talk to one of the guys working and order my coffee.
&gt;
&gt;By the time she brings me my coffee, she's obviously in a rush and I hold out a piece of paper folded with my number on it saying ""Text me sometime.""  
&gt;
&gt;She looks at the paper for a second and so does her coworker.  She stares at it and finally grabs it.  It's obviously made an awkward scene and I say goodbye and rush out the door.
&gt;
&gt;My anxiety kicks in and I'm shaking the entire time walking away from the store where I know she sees me.  
&gt;
&gt;I go home and I'm so fucking humiliated that something that was supposed to be quiet and inconspicuous turned into a scene.  I guess I won't be able to show my face back at that coffee bar.
&gt;
&gt;Tl;dr: try to give a girl my number at a coffee shop quiet and not to make a scene.  Make a huge scene where almost all her coworkers are watching and then I almost book it out of there. ",1504224219

When they created the mods, they did not think they would be paid. What, then, was their ""burden""? Did they hate making mods? Then why were they making them? Nobody told them to. Nobody told them they would get anything for it.

Was it a retroactive burden? ""I was fine with doing it for free but now I guess it was really a job that burdened me down all along""?

That is why I said it was a mentality shift, and not a new mentality being added. A community where everyone agreed to make things because they liked to make things suddenly began to feel 'burdened'. People who enjoyed free things because they were free suddenly are being 'entitled' and 'selfish'. 


We are discussing 'rights' and 'morality' on a thing that should not have had these issues at all. Nobody, up until now, was seen 'selfish' for assuming a mod would be free, because the very concept was ludicrous. Everyone knew mods were free, and everyone was absolutely fine with it. Modders knew, beforehand, they wouldn't get anything other than satisfaction. People who downloaded it knew they wouldn't have to pay because they knew the modders did this stuff willingly for free, without anyone asking them to.


Now we are acting as if this understanding, that has happened for decades and accross many different games, is inherently immoral. As if assuming someone would do something willingly for free is dumb, even though it is this exact mentality which created the modding community in the first place. As if assuming expecting mods to be free is exploitation, even though, again, for years this was the norm and nobody had ever, ever complained about it.

This is not a decision the community arrived by itself. This is a new mentality that was introduced with paid mods.",1504224221

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","This is what happens with overwatering: Normally the spaces between soil particles are filled with air--oxygen--which the plant roots need to survive.

When you water, it fills up these spaces, but then gravity pulls the water out through the bottom drainage hole.

If the spaces between the soil particles remain filled with water for too long, then the fine root hairs begin to die, cut off from oxygen.

Since the fine root hairs are the ones responsible for uptaking water from the soil, when they are damaged and die, they are no longer able to uptake water, and the plant wilts. Ironically, the classic symptom of overwatering is a plant that is wilted in wet soil. ""Why is it wilted? It has plenty of water!""

Water only when you stick your finger into the soil and it feels dry about 1"" down. When you water, add enough so it comes out the bottom. Discard this, do not allow the plant to sit in it and reabsorb it.

Watering deeply but infrequently does two things. It encourages the roots to do down deep where the water is.  If you always only water shallowly, as when you give it a quick splash from the hose, the roots all stay up in the top layer of soil. Then, when a drought event occurs, such as when you neglect to water, they're S.O.L., as they have no way to access any deeper reserves of moisture lower in the pot, even if there was water down there.

And second, it serves to flush out any accumulated fertilizer and mineral salts.

So, feel the soil with your finger, and when it feels dry 1/2"" to 1"" down, water it, and add enough so it comes out the bottom, and don't let it sit in the puddle.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Then I suppose I shouldn't have a surgeon remove the bullet and patch me up if I ever get shot. Surgery is clearly painful, and therefore wrong? 

I see there is a serious misunderstanding here.  Let me describe Hume's basic issue with reason as it pertains to morality, and it's modern offspring, moral sentimentalism, in more depth since it certainly isn't the caricature of silliness you seem to imply here.  A readable overview of where those views merge into a modern synthesis is Pinker's Moral Instinct article [NYTimes](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/13/magazine/13Psychology-t.html?mcubz=1) (or [pdf version here](http://www.faculty.umb.edu/adam_beresford/courses/phil_281_11/reading_moral_instinct.pdf)). 

Hume's point isn't complicated: ""Ask a man why he uses exercise; he will answer, because he desires to keep his health. If you then enquire, why he desires health, he will readily reply, because sickness is painful.  If you push your enquiries farther, and desire reason why he hates pain, it is impossible he can ever give any. This is an ultimate end, and is never referred to any other object. . .  And beyond this it is an absurdity to ask for a reason. It is impossible there can be a progress in infinitum; and that one thing can always be a reason why another is desired.  Something must be desirable on its own account, and because of its immediate accord or agreement with human sentiment and affection."" 

""Thus the distinct boundaries and offices of reason and of taste are easily ascertained. The former conveys the knowledge of truth and falsehood: the latter gives the sentiment of beauty and deformity, vice and virtue. The one discovers objects as they really stand in nature, without addition and diminution: the other has a productive faculty, and gilding or staining all natural objects with the colours, borrowed from internal sentiment, raises in a manner a new creation. Reason being cool and disengaged, is no motive to action, and directs only the impulse received from appetite or inclination, by showing us the means of attaining happiness or avoiding misery"" [Concerning Moral Sentiment](https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/h/hume/david/h92pm/appendix1.html).  

In Hume's view, reason makes surgery necessary because it is the best way to avoid later sickness and death.  But the sentiment, the fear of sickness and death, is the underlying motivation.

&gt; It seems self-evident that pain has nothing to do with wrongness. We have higher level cognitive faculties that can override intrinsic pain responses precisely because sensation and emotion provide insufficient guidance.

But those cognitive faculties are used to see how to avoid further pain, demonstrating that pain, the sentiment, is still the primary driving force.

&gt; I don't think that's true either. Going to school isn't always pleasant, and wasn't a pleasant experience for some parents, but even these parents consider sending your kids to school to be important.

As Hume points out, if we ask a parent why school is important, and then follow-up asking for a reason for each reason given, eventually we will reach a sentiment, not a reason.  And this is obviously true: a good parent wants to see their child happy, that's what school is all about in the end.

&gt; We often build emotional responses to things we rationally conclude are important. It's not always the other way around as you claim.

But we must first have a sentiment that forms the motivation that reason serves. That's Hume's simple, uncontroversial point.

&gt;&gt;Therefore, psychopaths don't find morality personally important. Effectively they are numb to the pain of guilt, they don't feel the pleasure and pain of empathizing with another person's joy and pain. They are blind to a vast dimension of meaningful human experience.

&gt;Agreed, but so what? Emotions are merely one way to understand morality, and a relatively poor one at that. Emotions can never grasp the full richness of a subtle moral dilemma, which must inherently be teased apart into smaller, manageable chunks which our reason then assembles into a complete picture of moral action.

But in the absence of emotions -- sentiments -- at the root of everything, there is no reason to tease anything apart; there is no richness.  The issue is bland and unimportant.  Reason employed on a boring task is listless, halfhearted; we know this.

&gt;&gt; We wouldn't punish a blind man for lacking the abilities of the sighted, so neither should we punish a psychopath for deficiencies in moral motivational biological machinery.

&gt; As already demonstrated, psychopaths understand right and wrong perfectly fine.  Further, you haven't presented a convincing argument that motivation is necessary for moral responsibility. Just because you're not particularly moved by not murdering people, doesn't mean murdering people is suddenly right.

It is unreasonable to expect someone to be moral if they lack the motivation of underlying sentiments that back morality with pleasure and pain.  Lack of moral motivation in psychopathy has a strong basis in  biology.  It is unreasonable to hold people morally responsible for traits, such as biology, that they have limited or no conscious control over.  That's the argument.

&gt; Finally, ""punishment"" is a question of justice. Morality entails no particular form of justice, retributive or otherwise.

I was using punishment as short-hand for morally responsible.

Traditionally, though, you're half right. In European politics the right wing is typically marked by the conservatives, however in Europe these tended (and tend in some cases) to be pro-monarchy, pro-aristocracy groups. You have to look at the history in Europe - of knights of old, kings, and the landed aristocracy. In American politics, since the US was born of a revolution against the monarchies of Europe, the right wing tends to be more what was historically the liberal ideologies in Europe before about the 1840s. 

I say the 1840s since that's when we see the beginnings of an early socialist movement, which upheaved the traditional political landscape (although I've seen it argued that the French Revolution in 1789 was the beginning). Suddenly the socialist groups became an ideological bunch more left of the liberals, and as time marched on the spectrum became dominated by the socialists on the left and the conservatives (who begun to take in many liberals) on the right. It took a while for this to progress to the US, but by the turn of the century the ""traditional"" left and right had been pretty much established. The Democrats became the party of the industrial workers, big government, and left wing. The Republicans became the party of the rural farmers, small government, and ""right wing"" (although NOT pro monarchy). Both had various levels of populism involved. 

Now, I say fascism isn't left or right because although the NSDAP (in this case) was very much left wing economically, it was fairly right wing socially. The NSDAP favored strong government controls over the economy, especially in crucial areas like automobile manufacturing and agriculture. The Nazis created various wage and price controls through the Labor Front as well. 

Now, socially it's *extremely* complicated, and the Nazis were a fusion of right wing elements like anti-vice and left wing elements like sacrifice for the community. Although the Nazis were quick to eliminate the hard left of the party in the Night of the Long Knives, the ideas of Volksgemeinschaft, Blood and Soil, and other Volkish elements persisted strongly in the Nazi ideology. Programs like National Socialist People's Welfare and Winter Relief for the German People were established to help foster the bons between all Aryan Germans. You see, the Nazis were undeniably socialist, but the difference was that while the socialists in the USSR were internationalist in outlook and doctrine, the socialists in the Reich were nationalist, using the Nordic-Aryan race in place of the workers and peasants. This idea combines right wing notions like nationalism with left wing ones like socialism and sacrifice of individualism for the whole.

I remember in the early days trying to introduce it to a friend looking for a game to play with his kids, and I figured it was the safest choice. But they claimed they hated it. And then a year or so later they just decided to start playing because they saw all the big names on YouTube going nuts with it and they wanted it. 

Around the time it was mostly /v/ and Reddit taking to the online modes, so it was relatively okay. You still had your griefers and dirtbags trying to ruin the fun but it was mostly filled with people who had enough respect not to completely destroy your stuff and even cooperate with you to build and trade and explore with. But then youtube came through and suddenly every server was filled with kids running around destroying everything in sight and spamming chat begging for mod/admin or threatening to continue if they didn't get it, or just general disrespectful behavior, to the point where the only way to get any enjoyment was to either stick to single player or start your own private server with friends (which was hard to do if your friends already were established on other servers).

Now she only has 1 fucking facial expression and I don't know what the fuck she's saying half the time.

She fucking exposed her escort roommate just so people would shit all over her. The bitch is nuts, she's probably compiling a file on Ice ready to expose him when she gets dumped. Don't get me wrong, it's gonna be good content when it happens, but she's a damn psycho. And Ice allowed her to pressure him into confirming their relationship status. Ice wanted to keep his options open, but she kept pushing and pushing until he finally confirmed her to be his girlfriend live on air. Now every time he does his whatitdoladies everyone will know he's just acting for the stream. She even wants to go to Las Vegas with Ice and Mitch to keep an eye on him. Shit's fucking lame, dude.

No offence intended, but it seems to me that your reading this wrong!  The English language is not what you find in legal dictionaries such as Blacks. Legalise is another language using the same symbols as English but with an entirely different meaning to the words, and that is what you find in Black's law and other law dictionaries!  This is why people have lawyers read and interpret contracts because what you are reading could (and likely would) mean something other than what you are thinking it does!  If there is no term in legalise to describe something in law,  then, and only then do the rules and definitions of the English language apply. (for example,  the act that governs family law here where I am describes children as ""issue""!  Someone reading this without at least a basic understanding of legalise would have an entirely different interpretation of the statute)
The relevant section of the act you are referring to,  like most acts,  is likely affected by other sections in the act..but this was put in place to allow for what we know as trusts or trust law.  Women for example were not allowed to own property in 1666.  So if something happened to her husband,  how then would she be able to stay on the property(estate)and not lose it to the king(providing he was a sovereign and not a monarch) or some other sovereign who claimed an interest?  By having someone trustworthy hold it for her(and any children she might have with her husband) benifit in perpetuity! (Trust)   This has been applied on a mass scale today.  Each of us ""citizens"" have in interest in the wealth of our ""country""!  This wealth is included in the ""estate"" described in the section of the act you placed in your comment!  Oil, minerals, forestry and the like, generate ""royalties"" paid to ""the people"" through these estates but we do not have access to our estate because we are viewed in the manner of infants, (and because the ""owner"" the same as the trustee under trust law,  is considered lost at sea or dead)and are unable to administer our own affairs.  The same as the benificaries of so long ago were forced to accept.  Unless and until you can prove in a court of equity that you are alive and well, your estate is administered by the public guardian and trustee!  For the good of the benificary(you)!
I realise this seems inconceivable but if you look around at how things are,  you can see it
In how things operate.  I was witness to a man who tried to pay a traffic ticket through his social insurance account (estate) but was told by a clerk in the courthouse that he ""did not have access to that!""  ",1504224230

"movies","t5_2qh3s","They will be getting so much needed money because of MoviePass. They owe MoviePass a thank you, not massive opposition. I've heard the nonsense argument that it gets people used to low prices. That's fucking idiotic. People aren't paying the exorbitant prices now. No evidence that even temporary pricing relief would change consumer habits. If nothing else, it'll get them to still go even if it reverted back.  
  Also, it can be a sustainable business model if people go to the theater. I just used my Movie Pass twice this week. That gave the theaters 2 ticket prices that they wouldn't have otherwise received. And because I didn't pay for the ticket directly, I bought overpriced concessions. And who cares that the soda was $7? I don't when I'm getting in for 'free.'  
 This will go down as one of the most short-sighted ugly business decisions in US history. It has the potential to not only destroy themselves, but also a whole industry (cinemas). If Movie Pass fails, that's it for movie theaters.",1504224230

Simon got in a spat with Totalbiscuit over gamergate.

That said, I have often found that women are their own worst enemies.  I have a friend who is an absolute *bulldog* in the boardroom.  Doesn't take shit from anyone, and her business gets *done*.  But when it comes time to negotiate her salary, she becomes as meek as a mouse.  She has never earned more than 50% of what her male colleagues earn in her entire career, despite being more capable than many of them combined.  I've tried to help her many, many times, and she just seems unable and unwilling to do anything about it.

But I think this speaks to a deeper problem - that she sees it as almost *rude* - that is, socially unacceptable, for a woman to fight for a decent, fair salary.  And this is what we as a society need to address.  She shouldn't have to feel out of place negotiating because she's a woman.

But after looking back and appreciating it for what it was supposed to be, then the subtleties became much more interesting. I think you're right that there was no direct evidence of there actually even being a monster, despite what the ""It"" implies.

Ouija: Origin of Evil (surprisingly great horror movie) had some good subtlety. A couple times it showed a shocking image/monster in the background, but unlike typical mainstream horror movies, the camera doesn't zoom in on it or play a loud music sting.

"climatechange","t5_2rawx","Not surprising, Cliff Mass, is fairly consistent in stating that many events are not due or exacerbated by climate change, such as the [forest fires in the Pacific North West](http://archive.seattleweekly.com/home/961097-129/cliff-mass-knows-climate-change-is).  I would categorize him as being outside the mainstream of scientists.

&gt;So Hurricane Harvey developed in an environment in which temperatures were near normal in the atmosphere and slightly above normal in the Gulf.    The clear implication: global warming could not have contributed very much to the storm.

&gt;OK, let me go out on a limb. Let us assume that all of the .5C warming of the Gulf was due to human-caused global warming.  That NONE of it was natural.  And that the air was warmed by the same amount. Using the scaling described above implies an increase of 3.5% in the extreme precipitation of this storm.  So for places that received 30 inches, perhaps 1 inch resulted from global warming. Not much.  Immaterial regarding impacts or anything else.

So in one paragraph he claims that the temperatures are near normal then in the very next paragraph he acknowledges the temperature as beign 5 degrees celsius above normal!  That's a huge amount of difference.

"menkampf","t5_3634b","&gt; The prime examples are day care and school teachers; these are people that we are literally trusting the lives of our kids with, but they get paid shit in most cases.  

We don't pay people based on our trust in them. I trust you with my life every time I drive next to you in traffic, but I ain't payin' you shit just to drive next to me in traffic.  

We pay people based on supply and demand. **Anyone** could be a daycare or school teacher. You don't need intelligence or hard work to do it. If the bar of entry is ""don't be a drugged out loser"" then there's going to be a HUGE AMOUNT of competition in the field. If you want $40 an hour but the other thousands of options want $12 an hour, they're just going to price you out of business.  

&gt; Nursing used to get paid shit, but wages started to rise as more men entered the profession.  

Wages started to rise **as more women realized that they could become doctors instead.** Women left the field and now there is a desperate shortage of nurses. My mother is a nurse and talks about it all the time -- she gets paid very well and has many competing job offers at any given time for different hospitals even willing to relocate her.  

And nurses weren't always paid poorly. My mother used to make ~90k/year back in the 80's (when ~90k/year was worth about double what it is now) because she was part of the Traveling Nurses. Again, there was a lower supply of nurses willing to travel (many had families!). This is also why people who do engineering or medical work in places like Iraq (where fear prevents many from going) get paid more: lower supply.  

&gt; The example I use is...  

This is a great example of low-level interpersonal sexism that has **absolutely nothing to do with society at large and anything we can do to lower the perceived wage gap.** We can't make parents stop raising their kids to be sexist pieces of shit. And this is at least partially offset by shit like affirmative action: a woman who pushes through stereotypical bullshit will have better access to colleges and careers that are primarily man-dominated. **Society is already doing what it can to offset what it can't control.**  

If you want to make the argument that women are encouraged to do shittier/lower-skill jobs due to low-level sexism in society, I could buy that. But there isn't really a solution other than ""Wait for the older generations to die; sexism will decrease over time"" unless you want to force your views down everyone's throats.  

But if you want to make the argument that women in shitty jobs deserve to be paid more, that's nonsense. Tons of male-dominated jobs also make total shit for money because, **like I said**, shit jobs have a high supply of workers that are competing and are willing to be paid less. I was a bus-boy making $5.25 an hour back in 2006, and most bus-boys are, you guessed it, boys. Nobody is offering them $40/hour just because of their dick -- people pay you like shit if you are just doing a job that **anyone** could do. ",1504224238

"television","t5_2qh6e","Question, since you're in the industry and would have a good take on this:  Do you think this series has any redeeming qualities? 

I am very, very pro marijuana (recreational and medical, and have needed it for medical reasons in the past), so I'm no stranger to it and the culture around it...however, I'm of the opinion that while a show like Disjointed is definitely not a good show, and revels in dumb stereotypes, it actually can be GOOD for marijuana acceptance in this country.  The reason being is that a lot of the country is older and conservative, and don't have ANY knowledge of marijuana users and its uses.  These same people also LOVE shows like Two and a Half Men and Big Bang Theory.  They like their TV easy-to-digest.  Putting out this style of show, with this certain theme, is a way to reach out to those people and slowly but surely get them more accepting of marijuana and the people who use/sell/advocate for it.  

I agree that it is using low hanging fruit for jokes, but so did BBT and now people aren't scared to admit they like ""nerdy"" stuff as much and you hear jocks making ""bazinga!"" jokes amongst friends, clearly indicating they watch the show and like the corny-nerd characters on it.  

Fact is, these types of people are not watching more accepted ""quality"" shows in the first place (like Handmaid's Tale, for instance) so while I would also love to see a series that was of better writing and production quality, the only people who would watch it are going to already be on the pro-marijuana side.  Series like Disjointed, again, while stupid, do help ""normalize"" people who use it and live with it to those who only know about it from propaganda films or what their pastor says on Sundays.  

Edit: for example, and I know a lot of people who say ""I turned it off after 10 minutes"" probably don't realize this, but they had an entire episode and story arc about a soldier using it to help with his PTSD.  There is a definite crossover between the fans of Chuck Lorre shows and military families, and that representation of even a fictional character using it to treat their PTSD (something these military families are definitely dealing with) and showing support and care to them is overall a net positive, and may lead to more veterans thinking about and using MMJ to help them out.  Their families may now also feel less inclined to ostracize them for it.

Also post-war Sasuke based on speed demonstrated in Boruto movie. He can also do long ranged attacks that hit the target immediately like Amaterasu if I remember correctly (I've forgotten if there are others).

She doesn't seem to move around very much (yes, she flies but seems to stay in the same place) so what if Naruto or Sasuke acts as a distraction and Ino (hidden somewhere) does some sorta mind destruction jutsu?

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Well, you will get a lot of hate from the self claimed PvE elitists in this sub for saying anything against HOT. I also had my problems and even to this day there are mobs I just avoid (I'am looking at you [Veteran Bristlebacks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Bristleback)) but I learned to adopt and take some defensive perks into my build and instead of going full glass cannon and it became better. You just need some time to learn the attack patterns of the mobs and when to dodge and then it will be ok.

Also you have to accept that these maps were designed to be played as endgame when HOT came out and you can't rush or complete them in a matter of hours like you can with the core maps. I just played through the story even if I died several times on specific missions, and started with LS3 to get mastery points and maxed out my gliding skill. Now the Hot maps are somewhat more enjoyable but I still hate the vertical map design. Maybe it's just my personal problem, even after knowing them I just can't enjoy moving through them. 

Also because I am and will probably always be a solo player I really hate the fact that the maps are made for group/zerg play. I am ok with the meta events needing serious coordinated groups but locking the hero points, which you need for getting your elite spec in the first place, behind champions is a major game design fail IN MY OPINION. In GW1 we had at least the chance to hire NPC's and still play solo where in here you just have to give up when you will find no one helping. This is the biggest turn off for me to not enjoy HOT and I hope this will change in PoF.

I think giving players the ability to hire a NPC to help them out a little bit in Hot would really make the life of solo players better, even if it just were for hero points when noone is around to help.  I was really thankful that at least in the story missions the other guys were there to help out.

Today many can be found on the internet.

I have ADHD-PI. I've often heard people say ""Oh, yeah, I'm a bit scatterminded/forgetful/unmotivated/whatever else, too! I totally know what it's like!"", when in reality, there's a difference between being like that *occasionally* and feeling the effects every single day, and having your life severely impaired by it. It's not really comparable, and it's quite insulting to try.

&gt;I could go in to get diagnosed rn and they would 100% write me a prescription for a drug of my choice to treat my ""ADHD"" Don't believe me?

That's cool. You wouldn't be able to do that where I live, though. It took me more than a year of tests and talking to people specialized in diagnosing and treating ADHD to arrive to the point where I got prescribed Concerta, after which I was tested a bit more to get an idea on whether or not it's working.

&gt;Drugs are not a great solution people, they're not even a solution! It's meant to be temporary to help align your life again!

You're talking out of your ass, going against every single expert, with absolutely nothing to back it up. I'm on ritalin now, and it's great. The difference is night and day.

&gt;You'd feel strongly too carrying the weight of my experiences.

I do feel strongly, because it's a subject I'm personally affected by. You might feel strongly about it, but that doesn't change the fact that you're objectively wrong and you've provided no argument whatsoever.

In the two other ships from Homeworld, they had a worker (Peridot/Topazes) and a supervisor (Aquamarine/Jasper). The fact that the Rubies could do pretty much whatever as long as they do their mission says a lot about the trust that Homeworld has in them. In fact, I'm not even sure if their mission would qualify as a failure since the intelligence they provided was vital - if it weren't for them, Homeworld would have had no idea that Rose Quartz and her rebels survived, and are probably the reason why Jasper is missing (which is true).

If I were Homeworld, I'd think that the Ruby Squad would be particularly valuable because they're the only Era 2 Gems who know about Earth and have experience with the Crystal Gems.

The Weaver felt like a massive boost to my already adored Elementalist, it felt so much tankier than before and with unique spell combos and complex rotations to learn and master.  
The Mirage apparently got a lot of flack here on the subreddit but I honestly think that after those two it was my 3rd favourite, it's true that it plays very much like base Mesmer, only exaggerated, you get to be trickier, stealthier, more deceptive and your abilities all flow extremely fluidly from one to another, it just takes a bit of getting used to the new dodge mechanic.  
The Renegade I felt like was a great addition simply because of them adding a ranged Condi weapon which the Revenant desperately needed to make the build worthwhile.

Most of the other classes I felt mostly neutral on. A few like the Deadeye or Spellbreaker didn't seem to do very well in PvE but they have their places in other modes instead.",1504224245

"longtail","t5_2y2kz","&gt;This happened literally less than 10 minutes ago and I'm feeling so fucking embarrassed.
&gt;
&gt;There's a girl at my nearby coffee shop.  She and I have been talking for a few months but I've never gotten the nerve to ask her for her number.
&gt;
&gt;So I read online that it might be easier handing the girl your number, since she's working.  It shouldn't make a scene and would be pretty easy to act like it never happened if she doesn't text me. 
&gt;
&gt;I go into the store and talk to one of the guys working and order my coffee.
&gt;
&gt;By the time she brings me my coffee, she's obviously in a rush and I hold out a piece of paper folded with my number on it saying ""Text me sometime.""  
&gt;
&gt;She looks at the paper for a second and so does her coworker.  She stares at it and finally grabs it.  It's obviously made an awkward scene and I say goodbye and rush out the door.
&gt;
&gt;My anxiety kicks in and I'm shaking the entire time walking away from the store where I know she sees me.  
&gt;
&gt;I go home and I'm so fucking humiliated that something that was supposed to be quiet and inconspicuous turned into a scene.  I guess I won't be able to show my face back at that coffee bar.
&gt;
&gt;Tl;dr: try to give a girl my number at a coffee shop quiet and not to make a scene.  Make a huge scene where almost all her coworkers are watching and then I almost book it out of there. ",1504224246

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","That's astonishing to me. It's clear to me that I am trying to convey an understanding of what satanism actualy is. I am motivated to do so, because I have this understanding, that removed much fear and replaced it with seemingly obvious, mechanical understanding of behavioral causality. I am motivated to explain it to people who are in ignorance, who I perceive are unknowingly supporting these useless eater freaks with their fear based beliefs and predictable reactions to them.

The more we understand about anything, the better we can make choices to effectively mitigate the harmfulness. Disease is a good example. The more we know about parasitic viruses and bacteria, the less we have to suffer their effects. The same is true of this phenomenon of satanism. It is so much like disease, it is opportunistic parasitism, just like disease. It is NOT beyond our understanding. It just cleverly sets up many emotional, logical and social blockages that prevent us from realizing what it is. Having overcome some of them, I am compelled strongly by my thirst for justice, peace, freedom harmony and joy for all that I must repeatedly type it out, wasting hours of my time over and over again. I bet most others would do the same, if they were in my position. 

I don't want to be condescending at in saying this, but I recognize that I tend to use words others may not know. I do, because they are succinct. I'd have to type out even more to explain things without them. They are the appropriate words, but if you aren't familiar with them, the meaning being conveyed will appear to be absent. Even though I do, my posts on this matter often have to be shortened due to the 10k character limit on reddit. I tried to make my original post brief, but even then it was seen as too long and people apparently didn't get it.

* Bran has given up his humanity to become the three-eyed raven. He survives by holding onto some greater purpose.

* Arya has given up on feeling, she's hardened her heart against fear, against loss, against compassion.  She endures pain unflinchingly. What she holds tightly to is her hatred and to needle.  

* Sansa doesn't hold to a higher purpose, she's not driven by thoughts of revenge.  Sansa survived as she did by being able to play the part, by learning the schemes and by keeping her true feelings hidden. Sansa clings to allies wherever she can find them, she values loyalty wherever she can take it, and she will scheme to win it. 


So of course Arya *shouldn't* blame Sansa for surviving in the manner she did, but Arya survived by not needing people, and Sansa survived by winning people.  They are inverses of one another, and they have a very hard to time coming to understand one another.  ",1504224246

"swtor","t5_2qxih","Hey everyone,

I want to start by apologizing for the unexpected and prolonged downtime today. This isn’t something we ever want to happen, but when it does, we take it seriously and do everything we can to resolve the issue or issues. We are adding additional processes to try and prevent this particular situation from happening again. Here’s essentially what took place today and what’s behind the long downtime:

What happened? Wasn’t this tested?
The issues we encountered were fairly complex, and having more than one just made things complicated. The first problem was the patch for our BitRaider and SSN launchers were inconsistent and ended up causing different issues after we took the servers out of maintenance. As a result, some of you actually received a game patch, while others didn’t get anything. You’d think we would catch that in our normal tests, but it was an oversight in our process which we have since corrected. The big issue was part of the patch that should have been included was missing data, so it was pulling information from 5.4 instead of 5.4a. The net result was a variety of issues – including some of the patch changes didn’t seem like they were deployed.

Although we extensively test all of our updates at all stages of the process, the missing parts just caused enough oddball problems, we had to take the game down again to figure out what was going on. In reality, had I been a little more patient, we would have caught the issues beforehand, yet the long downtime would not have been avoided. In addition, not everything we had planned to fix is actually included. For example, we have resolved the exploit with the Umbara Stronghold, but it didn’t make it in the 5.4a patch. Therefore, we have our normal infrastructure maintenance planned for next Wednesday, so our current plan is to deploy the change at that time. We implore you to not participate in this exploit as we don’t want any further disruptions in your game play.

Players lost time today, especially in the EU, is anything being done?
Losing playtime is always painful, especially when there is a “double” event running and Dailies awarding crazy high CXP. I’m kicking around a variety of options with the team, as we want to apologize and reward your patience. Some of you have asked to have our Double XP/CXP event extended and others have asked us to keep the current CXP amounts for the Daily Areas. Others have asked for different compensation, and we’re looking at all options as the last couple weeks have been tough on all of us. We’ll lock down what exactly we’re doing and let you know in the coming days.

Again, thank you all for your patience today.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","What number of options?  The vast majority of ""side quests"" were ""go to this planet, find this node, click on it"" or ""go to this location, run around one of three maps (starship, colony building #1, colony building #2) and kill things until complete.  Very few had anything to do with choice, and those that did had zero effect on the game or it's sequels.  

The much-vaunted choices in character leveling were anemic and meaningless.  Yes, you could divide your points up and fill in LOTS of little boxes.  Most of those boxes were nothing more than tiny percentage increases that had little effect on gameplay.  If you wanted to be good at something, you had to ignore many of those skills and focus on the ones you wanted to max out.  

I've replayed the entire trilogy just recently (including a quick run through ME1) and this thing you're talking about with ""less dialogue choices"" is baffling to me.  I experienced no such thing.  Dialogue throughout ME3 consisted of a series of ""exposition questions"", back and forth, and usually a trio of final answers.  Sometimes they were all neutral.  Sometimes it was Paragon, Neutral, Renegade.  And in all three games, you could easily fill up one side while filling up the others.  You simply made the major story choices all from one perspective, and made the rest however you wanted.  And that's IF you were compelled to play it as Pure Paragon or Renegade.  

I can point you to countless threads talking about various forms of ""Paragade"" where players played as they wanted throughout all three games, and the worst consequence was not fully maxing out the higher side and thus missing one single speech check at the end to skip one phase of a boss fight.  

We can agree that the MP in ME3 was a horrifically bad sign though.  Then again, forced multiplayer in a single player game always is. ",1504224249

&gt;There are jobs out there that are physical and over time create pains that are effectively treated with mj. But because it is detectable for up to 30-90 days, folks are medicating with heroin-in-a-pill.

Right, because we are currently not at the point where you can treat it properly and we have no short-acting MJ drug. I would love a short acting MJ drug to show you are not presently high. Nixon fucked shit up and we're luckily making strides to upturn that decision. 

&gt;In states where it is legal the deaths related to heroin-in-a-pill are nothing compared to states where mj is illegal.

Right, but those are just people who want to get high. You are conflating people who want to get high vs the efficacy of MJ. Look, I love MJ, I use it myself, but to be frank, it does nothing more than alter how you perceive pain, and for therapeutic applications, it's essentially just as good as aspirin. Now for seizures, parkinsons etc, it does wonders, but were not talking about that.

"bobssoapyfrogwank","t5_3m541","&gt; Is invalidated by a posted typing speed with 200ms keystrikes and 250ms reaction time, as already specified.

Not invalidated since you based it on AVERAGE reaction time and keep ignoring the touch aspects. You've done this over and over. I'm the typist. I know darn well when I type and catch the error before going past the period.

&gt;So you can't demonstrate your claim?

Since my claim is that they did not address it, there is nothing to point to. However, that would not apply to your claim, would it?

&gt;You can claim what you like as a reaction speed, as you have already admitted that you run on and haven't counted how often it happens.

But it happens. That's all I need to show I can react fast enough. Doesn't have to be every time. Besides, there are other factors which can intrude at any given moment. For example, there would be a huge difference if I was typing something fully automatically and typing pretty much the same speed, but also thinking about what I'm going to be typing next. Doesn't change my basic reaction ability, but it sure will affect how well I can use it.

&gt;Anyway, as you don't catch them all, you can't be reacting fast enough.

Not fast enough to catch them all perhaps, but never said otherwise. Your argument would be like telling the person who has run the hundred meter dash in 9 seconds sometimes that he really can't be that fast because sometimes he doesn't.

&gt;you cant feel the error

That's weird, because I often do and can feel an error before I see it. Maybe it's my experience with musical instruments making me more sensitive to small differences. BTW, did you feel to ""feel"" you error above AND fail to see it? Does the fact that you missed it mean you can't see errors? That's the logic of your argument.

"GalaxyS7","t5_2wi0z","The heart rate sensor is used far less than the FP scanner, for everyone. You need to unlock the phone to use the heart rate sensor, so by default you are used the FP scanner more often than the heart rate scanner.

Personally, I prefer functionality over looks, so I disagree with you about having the FP scanner under the camera or on the side of the phone. I still prefer it on the front over everything else though.

I agree with you about the iPhone 8 island on the top; it looks stupid (to me) and may hinder functionality. I'm more than happy to see how it pans out in reality, but I haven't been able to test that; yet I *have* tested the S8 and do not like its FP scanner. You can say anything you want but you won't change my opinion, just like how you can tell me why green is a better colour than blue, but I will still prefer blue. It's just personal preference for this.

&gt; It's literally the same tactic that was used convince Americans that everyone else must love trump and Hillary.

People can be easily influenced by media, advertising, and their own train of thought. Yes, it sucks a lot of the time and hinders progress, and it's especially annoying for me because I spend a lot of time pre-analysing, conversing with people, researching, discussing further, testing, and just trying to understand things before judging. I'm only human, so I screw up too of course, but the sheer number of people who buy a phone because ""it looks pretty"" still baffles me.

This is why marketing works so well.

&gt; The finger print scanner is way more out of a way than having an island breaking the screen from the top. unlocking your phone is a mindless experience that ends up being all muscle memory. I even try to I lock my wife's S7 by tapping it on the HRM now

I'm assuming you meant ""The finger print scanner is less annoying than having an island breaking the screen from the top"" due to your previous argument saying it's a non-issue, as well as the following sentence. Yes, I could live with it. Yes, I could probably live with having an island at the top of the phone. Yes, I could live with curved screens/corners, no top/front speaker, no headphone jack, Trump being president (I do live with this but I live in Australia anyway), or even \*gasp\* using an old Nokia phone with no 3G.

*But I don't* ***want*** *to do any of this*. I can't change Trump being president, but I can decide between thousands of different phones; so I choose to buy a phone with a fingerprint reader at the front and no curved edges/corners *and* a headphone jack, I am considering modding it to activate the top speaker, I provide my opinion on why a rear-mounted, off-centre fingerprint reader is not for me, and I try not to get too emotional about specific companies and the choices they make with their products ;)

There's a 99.9% chance that *something* will be wrong/not good enough for me with every device I buy, regardless of the company that designed or built it.

I think you misunderstand the situation, the club wanted to keep Ake and Chalobah, Conte wanted Chalobah to sign new deal and go on loan but the two understand that it'll be hard to get game time so they asked to leave, we clearly expect them to come good that's why there's a buyback clause. Nobody was trying to get rid of anyone.

&gt;If you're so certain Chalobah wouldn't have got nearly enough playing time at Chelsea this year, why should Drinkwater?

Grab whatever frozen veg you find on sale. I'm guessing you may want a few other meals than soup, so some cheap frozen veg is ready for anything!

&gt;
&gt;There's a girl at my nearby coffee shop.  She and I have been talking for a few months but I've never gotten the nerve to ask her for her number.
&gt;
&gt;So I read online that it might be easier handing the girl your number, since she's working.  It shouldn't make a scene and would be pretty easy to act like it never happened if she doesn't text me. 
&gt;
&gt;I go into the store and talk to one of the guys working and order my coffee.
&gt;
&gt;By the time she brings me my coffee, she's obviously in a rush and I hold out a piece of paper folded with my number on it saying ""Text me sometime.""  
&gt;
&gt;She looks at the paper for a second and so does her coworker.  She stares at it and finally grabs it.  It's obviously made an awkward scene and I say goodbye and rush out the door.
&gt;
&gt;My anxiety kicks in and I'm shaking the entire time walking away from the store where I know she sees me.  
&gt;
&gt;I go home and I'm so fucking humiliated that something that was supposed to be quiet and inconspicuous turned into a scene.  I guess I won't be able to show my face back at that coffee bar.
&gt;

Our Sales: I'm actually happy about Ox leaving, he was a potential that never came to fruition. Glad that Gibbo and Lucas are finally able to play. Gab can improve his game somewhere else without costing us points.

We have solid new buys in Kos and Laca. We have a good squad in general to compete properly in EL. We can get into CL two different ways. 

Let's win some titles, boys. Get behind the boys and let's get their morale up. Let's get this season started. I'm waiting for a banger from Giroud and Laca next game. 

Gunner for life.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","No the file will not download faster. Modern Wifi transmits using AM (actually QAM which is the same except it uses complex numbers) on hundreds of evenly spaced frequencies. Each transmission on those frequencies is constant for a fixed amount of time. The amount of time each transmission is constant for is decided by the base station's clock. Any amount of movement at your end (even at relativistic speeds) doesn't change that symbol time. Your modem will simply have to adjust its internal sense of time to compensate for the Doppler shift in frequency. If the symbol time doesn't change then the datarate doesn't change either.

The Doppler effect *is* a potentially significant impairment though. This shifts the frequency which must a) be measured by your wifi chip and b) must be corrected. If the *change* in frequency is slow, there's no problem – the wifi chip is designed to handle it. But if the change is fast, it will fail to keep up, fail to decode the data and it will have to be retransmitted, lowering the datarate. This is not a problem for walking speeds. But on a high speed train (moving relative to the wifi basestation), it might be a problem.",1504224260

He talked about how having the community sit and shoot at a cave for hours in order to get the gear they wanted was a giant eye opener about how bad the grind felt. They spent the next few years after vanilla making progress feel smoother. LOTS of mistakes where made in trying to get it right and if it wasn't for the base mechanics I don't think any of the community would've stuck around. In the last year and a half I think we saw them really get it right for the first time. 

They got rid of a lot of boring unneeded grind (planetary mats, raid item mats) and I always feel like I am progressing no matter what activity I want to do. I stopped feeling like I had to play their way in order to get better stuff and could just play patrol if I wanted to just relax. As someone who spent thousands of hours playing the game and loves it, I still feel like I played a really long beta project. But with two I feel like they've finally got it right and all the cheesing, bugging, app/website creating and, frankly, cheating stuff that the community did in order to make the game playable has paid off.

3.  Really depends on how much they buy into the experience, their imagination and their ability to play well with others.

4.  Rule of Cool is the only rule to remember.  If you want to keep checking rules, do so, otherwise just go with what feels right and check the rules later.

5.  You can play with less, but remember some battles expect 5, so if things are overwhelming maybe have some enemies run for help and never come back or do the Jackie Chan one ninja at a time thing.",1504224266

Probably the best thing you can do is play with her and explain things through gameplay. Maybe let her use an account that has a lot of champions unlocked. And let her play tutorials first. 

Probably the most difficult thing to explain is the item builds because the whole concept is pretty strange for someone with no experience. Maybe explain how you get an item from smaller items and which items are good on a champion she's playing and why. It can be confusing to build swords on a ranged champion 

League really isn't that hard to play vs bots, you just try to kill shit and run around. Maybe you even do dragon or buffs. Lux is probably pretty good choice, maybe Lulu, Annie, even Soraka can be fun because you heal people. Morgana is probably pretty hard to play because bots can dodge skillshots and if you miss your Q you don't really do much. I think these champions can also be fun for beginners: Volibear, Jhin, Ashe, Fiddlesticks, Jinx, Karthus, Shyvana, Vel'Koz, Warwick, Ornn.

"humanresources","t5_2qibb","Your professor is correct. General mental ability is a good and legally defensible predictor. That being said, it needs to be used like any other tool: carefully. Some things to consider.

1. Job sample tests are better predictors. So why not use them?
2. All predictors are flawed. Even our best ones. So best practice is to use multiple different kinds. Ability tests are often paired with personality tests and other selection devices. Using a single kind of predictor is never good. 
3. The quality of the test matters. A lot. There are lots of different mental ability tests. The good ones are expensive (and not usually called ""IQ Test"") and not nearly as biased as portrayed. The bad ones are cheap and not particularly valid. Is the job you are recruiting for worth the expense of a good test? 
4. There is research evidence that more is not necessarily better when it comes to ability. Rather, it is only necessary for people to have ***adequate*** ability.  So..determining the minimum level necessary for a job and screening as a hurdle (rather than a continuous predictor) is best practice and doesn't contain a lot of the pitfalls you are worried about.

Also, The Big House for the past two years was in the middle of nowhere in Dearborn. There's something to be said for having a well-run and well-established brand. 

I can't afford to travel for tournaments right now and if I could I'd pick Big House over almost any tournament series besides Genesis or MAYBE Evo. Trying to compete with one of the largest brands in Smash just seems like a bad decision.

"collapse","t5_2qhw9","&gt; Are you a paid shill or just an over indoctrinated sheep? 

Or... the OP finally realises that acting in opposition to your words is just hypocrisy (cognitive bias)... and blaming others for your choices is scapegoating.  Folks keep emitting because they are assholes, not because of some advertising campaign  

&gt;Too fucking scared to take on the man

Says all the folk too scared to look in the mirror for the source of the real problem.  Are you saying you'd own a slave unless your politicians told you it was the wrong thing to do ?

Are you saying Rosa Parkes wasted her time ?  Similarly Mary Manning in Ireland ?

You misunderstand how change occurs, which is why you keep doing the same shit but blame everyone else for your choices and blame everyone else for not doing anything.  For example, you own a dog, which has as many emisisons as an SUV..as just one example.  I am not saying owning a dog is bad but it's very hard to have a low emisions life and own a dog.

Change occurs slowly, you need a small number of folk lowering their emissions to the levels necessary (3-4t per annum) and normalising low emisions behaviour. More people then join in becasue we know how fucking dangerous it will get if we do not, eventually after 5% or so of folk start doing it, a movement starts.  Other folks will change how they vote.. once a critical mass of changed actions starts occurring, then and ONLY then does political action occur to force the recalcitrant to change.  That process takes several decades to occur.


All the so called bullshit advocates of emissions mitigation are hypocritical assholes and are part of the problem.  The biosphere doesn't care if you're a self righteous prick telling others what to do eg McKibbon, etal, it only cares about your emissions and enviormental impact. It doesn't care if the emissions are from you owning a dog, or the Koch brothers smoking rolled up cigars made from baby skin.  Your actions speak louder than your words, when these assholes all emit prodigiously and tell others they need to stop emitting, they are rightfully ignored. Just as a wife beater would be ignored if he was advocating to stop domestic violence.  So we have a group of high emiiting advoates no one pays any attention to (most of the developed world) and a group of high emitting deniers (a tiny small portion, mostly confined to the US) and a handful of folk around the world who take this seriously eg [Michael Kalmus](http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/life-after-oil/how-far-can-we-get-without-flying-20160211), [Joan Pick](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/nov/13/ethicalliving-carbonfootprints) etal

As for shaving, moisturize well beforehand and shave 3 times: once with the grain (down on your face and up on your neck), once against it (the opposite), and then once across to make sure you get your jawline well. If shaving your Adams apple is daunting, try pulling the skin to the side so you don't directly shave over it. 

Makeup can help disguise any beard shadow; I use a slightly darker skin-colored lipstick first, followed by a little liquid foundation and finally some powder. If you want to give your face a little shape after that you can try your hand at contouring.

First off, we're not gender biased here. There are plenty LL women that no longer desire their husbands. And for that matter, the same deal in same gender relationships. Secondly, when folks say that their partner is not attracted to them, we're NOT saying that they're not an attractive person. Attraction is such a tricky thing and even the best looking people in the world will find people who have no attraction for them. I'm sure that OP is an attractive woman. But it's not nearly enough to ensure that her partner will have sexual desire for her. I've come to terms with the fact that my wife has zero sexual attraction and desire for me. But I can step back and understand that it's just one person's opinion and that plenty of others may not feel the same. 

I consider myself to be a relatively LL male, probably due to low T, which I've been working on. I can go weeks without actively desiring sex and believe that I lean towards responsive desire and not spontaneous desire.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","You're almost certainly missing the point regarding people's frustration with the overall power level of current Jade Druid decks and its dominance in the metagame.

The presence of very few top tier decks makes the overall deck diversity in Hearthstone low. This leads to repetitive matches against deck lists that are often carbon copies of one another. Don't believe me? Queue up in standard ladder and see for yourself.

And let's not forget that this is an *online* collectible card game, which allows the developer the unique ability to *balance or change cards after they are released to the public*. Team 5 have rarely utilized this power, despite the consensus among the playerbase regarding the need for card changes. 

So, yeah. People are upset. Can you blame them? 

Thanks for reading.

**Edit:** I could obviously elaborate on how Team 5 *attempted* to nerf Jade Druid with the introduction of Skulking Geist... It's not like they are unaware of the issue. They just haven't provided a good solution.

&gt; The meta is never gonna be perfectly balanced. That's the nature of card games.

I addressed this point in the body of my post. While perfect balance is a ludicrous concept in any game with random effects, you need to understand that the nature of **electronic** collectible card games facilitates changes after cards are released. You seem to continue to overlook this idea, so I will continue to belabor it.

Besides, infinite combats doesn't do you much if folks can block. Damage to creatures is maintained until end of turn, so it's really only dangerous with: 

* Pinger effects that abuse the infinite untaps.
* A board where folks cannot block for one reason or another.
* A board where your (RED) creatures are Indestructible, somehow.
* Effects where you can abuse the extra mana (e.g., Each cycle I pump my [[Dragon Whelp]], and at the end of it, I [[Fling]] it at your face.)

Ford discussed and apparently carried around a copy of the SCOTUS ruling that said a pardon implied guilt. 
In Nixons case, he even got out of testifying - citing medical reasons. Nixons case is the extreme and I don't know that Trump had the kind of loyalty high up that Nixon had (Ford was good friends with Nixon and had been for years.

FWIW, I really think some things in this last issue were a bit too vague, but apparently a lot is supposed to be handled in aftermaths issues in the single tie-ins. And there's no denying that it's better not to dig too deeply into what exactly Kobik did to Stevil to change him, because I'm still not entirely sure that actually makes much sense. At this point, I'm simply going with false memories, self-delusion, and too much encouragement from others (Zemo, Elisa, the rest of the Hydra Council) who benefitted for various reasons from him believing in his Hydra past.

I do think that the story doesn't work half as well without CA:SR, I believe that's the tie-in you need to make it work emotionally. Thunderbolts helped me, too, in that respect, and those were the ones I mostly read, other than series that were spin-offs to Secret Empire itself (and Secret Warriors, which is really somewhere between a tie-in series and a spin off).

"getdisciplined","t5_2uzju","One problem I think, especially with doing something creative, is that we create a grand vision of ourselves and what we want to create, that ultimately stops us from doing it.

It is good to have plans, but at the same time we have to trick ourselves into just ""writing a few words"" and ""put running shoes on"".

I notice that you write ""try"" a lot. If you have the mindset of ""trying"" to do this *great* thing, you won't get much done, but if you have the mindset of ""doing"" this really *small* thing, you will get much further.

If you try to write music but fail, stop trying. Start to write music, and make sure it's really bad music. Set no standards for yourself and just challenge yourself to get used to the activity, not the result. Quanitfy it. Write a song every day.

I'm not a car guy, but I get the impression that car sales in the U.S. depend more on a 'cool' factor than it might in other regions of the world.

I feel like the only commercials that use numbers or statistics are truck commercials, and even then they're few and far between. I feel like if you've seen one car commercial in the U.S., you've seen them all. They avoid the numbers and stick with camera angles and cinematography to play on emotions.

Couple a lack of sexiness from the Bolt with the chevy brand (which is especially known to tap into the high-octane-red-blooded-americana spirit, and aside from the Volt is virtually non-existant in the electric arena) and I would say this car serves it's purpose.

"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","&gt;But..... no, don't do that. You take vamp for magicka classes and WW for stamina classes.

I feel like you're confused. It's true that werewolf is (almost?) completely useless for magicka classes, but the reverse is *not* true. Vampirism gives almost as many benefits to stamina characters as it does to magicka characters.

The thing with being a Werewolf is that you kinda need to base your build around it in order for it to be useful. It doesn't do you any good (or harm) to simply *be* a Werewolf, you need to actively slot in the ultimate and then actually use it in fights, which means sacrificing your normal abilities while it's active. By contrast, [Vampirism is *always* active](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Vampire) until you choose to disable it by feeding.

&gt;The sneak buff is nice, but as a nightblade you won't need it, try to level your legerdemain and take the passives that reduce sneak cost (10% per level!). 

You might be misinformed here. The vampire sneak bonus is to your *move speed,* not your stamina. You can have all the stamina bonuses in the world, but without the vampirism bonus (or dedicating [a ridiculous amount of equipment slots replacing it](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Night%27s_Silence)) it'll still take your character a long time to walk around.

It's even better for a nightblade, since you can combine the bonus with [concealed weapon](http://en.uesp.net/wiki/Online:Veiled_Strike) to gain an additional speed bonus while sneaking, allowing you sneak around almost as fast as other characters can sprint. You can't stack as many speed bonuses as you used to, but I believe this combo still works.

In any case, I think if I were /u/flxdg I would stay a Werewolf just to get the achievement for maxing the skill line out, and then cure it / switch to Vampire. Like I said before, being a Werewolf doesn't *hurt* you, but it's not going to help them either unless they actually start using the ultimate and other powers.

For reference, being a stage 4 vampire with the relevant passives would get them:

* +10% Stamina regeneration (also +10% Magicka regeneration, useful given that even Stamblades still use *some* Magicka).

* Up to 33% less damage taken from all sources once below 50% health.  

* Significant bonuses to move speed while sneaking.  

* Access to a couple (slotted) powers that're useful for low level Nightblades, such as Invigorating Drain (which stuns your target, heals you, and gives you a lot of ultimate).

* Penalties to health regen and fire vulnerability, which is inconvenient but easy to work around.

* Your character will get beaten by the ugly stick straight in the knee. And face. And chest. And presumably other places as well. Meh.

By way of comparison, the only bonus you get for being a non-transformed Werewolf is just +15% stamina recovery, and getting even that much still requires you to sacrifice your ultimate slot.

I'm not saying Werewolf is useless, just that Vampirism benefits Stamina/Magicka almost equally and in a passive way,  while Lycanthropy is kind of an all-or-nothing thing. ",1504224282

I had the Liletta IUD put in on August 18th, but I am still protected by the Depo-provera shot until October 10th-ish. I wanted to be off the shot based on the issues it causes with absorbing calcium. With Celiac and also my acid reflux problems both causing issues with absorbing nutrients, I didn't want to continue on a path with a third thing causing absorption issues.

"IsraelPalestine","t5_2sgz7","&gt; Are you sure you have read it?

Yes. That's talking about international *criminal* law. Go back to Kent's essay. As he explains, when it comes to international treaties, it's a long-standing principle that ex-post facto law does not apply unless specifically stated so. Therefore, the Fourth Geneva Convention and other treaties that did not specify an ex post facto clause did not apply retroactively as per CIL.

&gt;For the ratione temporis argument there is no difference between when a court assumes jurisdiction and when a newly created law is said to begin to apply. Citing myself:

Except that that's not how it works. The reason the Greeks had a right of return to Northern Cyprus was because international law mandating the right of return of refugees already existed in 1974. Refugees who became refugees before a right of return was recognized as a legal right don't count. Kent specifically argues that had such international laws mandating the right of return existed at the time, then yes, they would have been entitled to return, but because they didn't, later laws that were made today, even while there are still refugees, don't count. In other words, because the refugees were displaced at a time when no obligation to return them existed, that sticks, despite currently existing laws that mandate the return of refugees, which only apply to refugees after that had come into effect. That's Kent's interpretation, which he explicitly lays down at the conclusion, and i'll personally go with the interpretation of a Professor of Law at Fordham University Law School over yours, if that's alright with you. If we were to adopt your legal standard, we'd have descendants of refugees going back centuries claiming rights of return to various places.

&gt;And let me quote Julius Stone:

See [this](http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~James.Popple/publications/articles/retroactive/2.shtml) and [this](http://guide-humanitarian-law.org/content/article/3/non-retroactivity/) and [this](https://www.revistas.usp.br/rfdusp/article/viewFile/66677/69287), which openly says that those believing in retroactivity are outnumbered by those who believe it's illegal, and that arguments for retroactivity are not favored by most jurists. As you can see, the principle of non-retroactivity is even **mentioned in the Geneva Conventions**. To sum it up, retroactivity is a minority viewpoint. And Stone is talking about criminal law anyway, not treaties. 

Oh, and as a side note, Julius Stone was one of the premier legal scholars who argued that Israeli settlements are perfectly legal under the Fourth Geneva Convention. As in, *all* Israeli settlers are there legally, not just the ones  exercising a hypothetical right of return to original homes.

&gt;It wasn't the allied powers that drew up the 4thGC, it was human rights lawyers from the Red Cross. They then wrote a 1000 page long book detailing exactly how they thought that the convention should be interpreted.

You mean human rights lawyers *and* government experts, and the fact that it had to be approved in a diplomatic conference in Geneva by 63 governments. ([Source](https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/360?OpenDocument)). And the fact that the Allied powers all signed and ratified them. There's no way they would have done so had they believed they were reversing their own policies.

&gt;If it wasn't well established, how do you explain the outrage from the international community against the expulsion of the Palestinians? Rampant Antisemitism?

What outrage are you talking about? You mean how aside from some half-hearted pressure the whole issue was mostly dropped? I've never read of any widespread international outrage aside from that in the Arab and Muslim world. Some pressure, sure, but nothing too serious. The world was actually undergoing quite a few mass population movements at the time, it was actually peanuts in comparison to what had just happened in Europe and East Asia and what was going on on the Indian subcontinent.

&gt;That was in 1922, which was before many important developments in human rights had occurred.

Exactly. Thanks for proving my point. So you admit that right of return was not an international legal principle throughout the past centuries?

&gt;Because he represents CAMERA and is not a scholar.

So a Harvard PhD who was a postdoctoral fellow at Northeastern University, an instructor at Harvard, and someone whose published articles in multiple academic journals, lectured widely, and testified before the US Congress is not a scholar? Good to know.

&gt;And my reply:

Go back. Did you even read what I wrote? I already showed how Kent outlined how the Hague Conventions did not apply to the 1948 war. It began as a civil war (IE the Hague Conventions didn't apply), and since almost all of the Palestinian refugees either fled in advance of or were displaced during active combat operations and takeovers, before pre-state Yishuv forces or Israeli forces had solidified the occupation of their home, territory, as well as the fact that they were not occupying territory from a hostile state, the Hague Conventions did not apply to them. As a British officer he cited said, it was specifically designed to deal with events *after* military occupation of the territory of a hostile state had been solidified. To quote Kent: *""Any refugees who were expelled during the
period of combat, or before combat began, are not protected by the
Hague rules on belligerent occupation. The great majority of
Palestinian refugees appear to have fled prior to or during combat
operations, not after the establishment of control by the Yishuv’s
armed units.""*",1504224283

I tried buying expensive ones, they lasted a bit longer but still failed in a few months.

Then there are the knots. Every couple of days I had to waste my time untangling a mess. I swear to god, even if I tried to make such complex knots on purpose, it wouldn't be so bad.

Then there is the ""joy"" of walking around, the cable getting caught on a doorknob or something and having the buds violently ripped out of my ears. It was infuriating.

The only downside of bluetooth I find is that I have to charge them. But I charge so many devices already, I really don't care that I have to spend 5 extra seconds to connect 1 more cable.

I like to imagine sometimes what state judaism might have looked like around the time of jesus. And for me at its core, how someone back then would have reacted to corruption and mis-alignment of a cultural identity such as judaism. something which was supposed to be a path to living with God.

As far as I understand it, Jews tend to believe Hell is absence or Distance from God. and to Live the Righteous heavenly path is to be present with God.   I honestly don't see that as far off from what Christians believe, minus the literalism associated with words such as ""Hell and Heaven"".

"Ice_Poseidon","t5_3aelr","**Aposematism**

Aposematism (from Greek ἀπό apo away, σῆμα sema sign) was a new term coined by Edward Bagnall Poulton for Alfred Russel Wallace's concept of warning coloration. It describes a family of antipredator adaptations in which a warning signal is associated with the unprofitability of a prey item to potential predators. Aposematism always involves an advertising signal. The warning signal may take the form of conspicuous animal coloration, sounds, odours or other perceivable characteristics.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Here is what the UN defines genocide as.

any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:

(a) Killing members of the group;

(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group;

(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part;

(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group;

(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.



Now comes the important parts, highlighted below:

&gt;any of the following acts committed **with intent to destroy, in whole or in part,** a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, as such:



The two important concepts here are a) **with intent to destroy** and b)**in whole or in part**.


As they do, these terms have been ruled on and built on in international courts.


With regards to *Intent to Destroy*, the international legal community has been explicitly clear; 

&gt;580. The Trial Chamber is aware that it must interpret the Convention with due regard for the principle of *nullum crimen sine lege*. It therefore recognises that, despite recent developments, **customary international law limits the definition of genocide to those acts seeking the physical or biological destruction of all or part of the group. Hence, an enterprise attacking only the cultural or sociological characteristics of a human group in order to annihilate these elements which give to that group its own identity distinct from the rest of the community would not fall under the definition of genocide.** The Trial Chamber however points out that where there is physical or biological destruction there are often simultaneous attacks on the cultural and religious property and symbols of the targeted group as well, attacks which may legitimately be considered as evidence of an intent to physically destroy the group.”


EHRC decision on Jurgic v. Germany [PDF warning.](https://www.legal-tools.org/doc/812753/pdf/)


The ruling goes on to state that this is also the norm in international law, noting

&gt;“25. The Genocide Convention, and customary international law in general, prohibit only the physical or biological destruction of a human group. ... The Trial Chamber expressly acknowledged this limitation, and eschewed any broader definition. ...”

Same source, paragraph 43. There are other examples the court points to in there. 

The Canadian example falls terribly short on the ""intent to destroy"" aspect of the definition of genocide.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has much to say about the ""in whole or in part"".

&gt;It is well established that where a conviction for genocide relies on the intent to destroy a protected group “in part,” the part must be a substantial part of that group. The aim of the Genocide Convention is to prevent the intentional destruction of entire human groups, and the part targeted must be significant enough to have an impact on the group as a whole...This interpretation is supported by scholarly opinion. The early commentators on the Genocide Convention emphasized that the term “in part” contains a substantiality requirement. Raphael Lemkin, a prominent international criminal lawyer who coined the term “genocide” and was instrumental in the drafting of the Genocide Convention, addressed the issue during the 1950 debate in the United States Senate on the ratification of the Convention. Lemkin explained that “the destruction in part must be of a substantial nature so as to affect the entirety.” He further suggested that the Senate clarify, in a statement of understanding to accompany the ratification, that “the Convention applies only to actions undertaken on a mass scale.” 

The decision goes on to state:
&gt;Recent commentators have adhered to this view. The International Law Commission, charged by the UN General Assembly with the drafting of a comprehensive code of crimes prohibited by international law, stated that “the crime of genocide by its very nature requires the intention to destroy at least a substantial part of a particular group.”

The issue of ability and access is also raised;

&gt;The historical examples of genocide also suggest that the area of the perpetrators’ activity and control, as well as the possible extent of their reach, should be considered...The intent to destroy formed by a perpetrator of
genocide will always be limited by the opportunity presented to him. While this factor alone will not indicate whether the targeted group is substantial, it can - in combination with other factors - inform the analysis. 

ICTY Case No.: IT-98-33-A, par 8-13.  [PDF warning](http://www.icty.org/x/cases/krstic/acjug/en/krs-aj040419e.pdf)

I have yet to hear a proper argument for genocide in Canada that even comes close to meeting either of those criteria.

You need to tell her flat out that you are trying to be polite and kind about it, but frankly if Mess is at the wedding shower, you will not be. Mess is an abuser, and you've reached the point where you are trying to stand up to her despite a lifetime of abuse, and you need your friends to have your back. Here, I'll do a quicky possible letter for you:

""Friend,

I am afraid I need to be blunt, rather than circumspect, because I don't think I have made myself clear. Once you read the highlight reel I sent you, something that I've tried to keep a secret for most of my life will be clear. My mother is an abuser. Of course she's charming and welcoming to you, but she actually gets satisfaction, to the point of it nearly being sexual, in hurting me. She wants to make me cry at my wedding, the one day that is supposed to be about me, the happiest day of my life- because it will make her feel powerful. 

She manages to keep this going by being charming to other people and then in a quiet moment or when she has me alone, rip me to shreds. She enjoys it. She's not a good person, and she's not a good mother. At this point I don't want her at my wedding but I am trying to work with therapists to get something to the point where some shred of my relationship with my Mother can be saved, and it's not looking good.

I am probably going to have to cut her out of my life completely in the next few months because she has flat out refused to stop abusing me. I don't want her at the shower because she will do everything she can to ruin it- she's planning on it. She's going to throw a fit, or quietly when other people are doing something tell me that I look fat and disgusting and no one wants to marry me and none of you are actually my friends, and you are only there because you feel sorry for me. She's not going to stop until I'm sad and upset. Or she'll throw a massive temper tantrum and scream, to embarrass me.

She's going to do what she can to hurt me. I don't want someone like that at the wedding shower, so I will say this bluntly- either she is no longer invited, or I very much might not come.

I know it's awkward to put you in the middle of this, but you're my friend and I need you to have my back here.""

"CryptoCurrency","t5_2wlj3","I'm going to assume your American because you didn't say your nationality.

To avoid Coinbase fees when buying Bitcoin, you can use the Coinbase-owned exchange GDAX. 

To do this, you'll need to transfer USD from your bank account ahead of time. That transfer takes about 1 week to process. You can transfer to Coinbase or directly into GDAX.

If you transfer to Coinbase, then once the transfer is done, go to GDAX.com and instantly transfer your USD from your Coinbase account to your GDAX account (because Coinbase owns both sites, it's an instant transfer). 

Once the USD is in your GDAX account, you can go ahead and place a market order for BTC, LTC or ETH. This will purchase a set amount of crypto at the current asking price. The fee is a fraction of what you'd pay on Coinbase for basically the same thing.

Once you buy, you can transfer to any other exchange for trading. I use Bittrex. I haven't used Gemini. Avoid Kraken, they suck.

When you want to cash out, you have 2 options. Sell to USD on GDAX and withdraw to your bank account.  OR, sell to USDT (Tether) on Bittrex or other exchanges that offer it. This is basically a cryptocurrency that mirrors actual USD. When you own USDT, its the equivalent of USD. The main reason to do this is if you plan on reinvesting back into cryptos again in the near future. (I wouldn't recommend USDT for long term storage... only short term while you're riding something out.)

You can ""auto-sell"" on most exchanges by placing a limit sell or stop order. Limit sell order will sell your crypto once it reaches a certain price ABOVE where it is now (i.e. you're making money).  A stop order will sell your crypto when it reaches a certain price BELOW where it is now (i.e. you're afraid it will drop and you don't want to lose too much).

Hope that's helpful. Good luck to you.",1504224289

It's none of their business and it would more than likely come back to bite you in the ass somehow. If you leave the MSP be sure to give them the proper amount of notice. That's doing them right and it shows your new employer that you are professional. 

Consider this; If all it will take for you to lose your MSP job is that particular client firing your MSP, and you already know that client is unhappy with the service it is getting from your MSP, then it's time for you to start looking for another gig, anyway.

From a purely financial standpoint, yes, it's a rich man's ship. But the Idris is a frigate, a warship, this is its one and only role. A man interested in the luxury afforded by wealth would not be cruising around in one, hence my comparison of a sailing yacht vs. a naval corvette. It's not really the question of price, it's image and role. The 600i fulfills its role just by looking incredibly sleek and fancy and standing out among the rest. Trust me, in an MMO, that's enough.

Star Citizen is not meant to be the kind of game where you grind and grind for the ultimate ship, in fact the devs are going to some great lengths to ensure that won't be the case, and that a more expensive ship is not ever the automatic choice for whatever role. There are meant to be pros and cons to each, and that helps create a more diverse universe where we can't just decide one is hands down ""the best"", because ultimately no one would fly anything else.",1504224294

&gt;There's a girl at my nearby coffee shop.  She and I have been talking for a few months but I've never gotten the nerve to ask her for her number.
&gt;
&gt;So I read online that it might be easier handing the girl your number, since she's working.  It shouldn't make a scene and would be pretty easy to act like it never happened if she doesn't text me. 
&gt;
&gt;I go into the store and talk to one of the guys working and order my coffee.
&gt;
&gt;By the time she brings me my coffee, she's obviously in a rush and I hold out a piece of paper folded with my number on it saying ""Text me sometime.""  
&gt;
&gt;She looks at the paper for a second and so does her coworker.  She stares at it and finally grabs it.  It's obviously made an awkward scene and I say goodbye and rush out the door.
&gt;
&gt;My anxiety kicks in and I'm shaking the entire time walking away from the store where I know she sees me.  
&gt;
&gt;I go home and I'm so fucking humiliated that something that was supposed to be quiet and inconspicuous turned into a scene.  I guess I won't be able to show my face back at that coffee bar.

The OMSCS program is marketed as a program for the working adult and not a young uninterested college student. The students enrolled in this program are more than willing to put the time in to learn as much as possible and shouldn't require a ""pop quiz"" to prove they're paying attention. I'm really the type to complain, but there should be some level of autonomy with this. We have the course schedule, the deadlines, projects, etc. I don't see a need for micro-managing. 

I've been making steady progress at my own pace for the first assignment, but now have to course correct to find answers just for the participation check. Many of us have other courses as well as many responsibilities outside from OMSCS. I'm also flabbergasted at the idea of using Reddit for official course communications. It's horribly unorganized. 

ETA: I should also add that I travel quite a bit and like to plan out when I study and complete projects. The pop-quiz system is a non-starter for a grad school level course. ",1504224295

1.  Soon you'll need to add stack inserters and stack filter inserters.  Stack inserters are made from blue inserters, and stack filter inserters are made from stack inserters.
2.  I like direct insertion.  If you put the yellow inserters in between red and blue, they never need to go on a belt or in a chest.  You're never going to want to use yellow inserters, so it's nice that they're not available for you to walk by and pick some up.
3.  Late game, you may well find you need 10+ gear machines to keep up with inserter demand.  I like centralized gear production, but maybe it's a matter of taste.
4.  I usually automate purple inserters, but I usually regret it.  They go obsolete *so* soon.",1504224295

As I have stated in a post from last week, at this moment (according to Overbuff, so take it with a grain of salt) It showed Roadhog with a roughly 58-60% winrate since mid July or so at Grandmaster play. From my experience he was still fine at Grandmaster and I saw him every few matches and he worked great! =] Honestly I am expecting to see much more Roadhog in my Grandmaster matches this season, friend. 

Plus, he'll actually feed ultimates less because anyone shooting him while he is healing basically receives a 50% ult charge reduction due to half their damage being blocked =] So, in the end, he is alive longer and accrues more ultimate charge for himself and his allied healers this making him much, much more viable.

Edit: Keep in mind that win-rate previously when he one-shot was around 50% which, coupled with the pick rate being much higher, meant he was super powerful. I.E. Roadhog on nearly every team so he SHOULD have had a 50% win-rate =] ",1504224296

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","When I first started the talk with my wife, I wanted her to understand that I was feeling hurt and rejected and that given her kind nature towards me in other areas, once she knew, I thought that would be that. 

Didn't work. 

She always saw it as an attack. She would get defensive and spin the wheel of excuses, get me to do choreplay, talk about the house, her career anything that she didn't like that she saw as stumbling blocks to being happy. Because her being happy was apparently her key to wanting sex. Turns out, it wasn't. 

I accommodated all of her gripes. She got her bigger house, I did housework like it was my new hobby, she went back to study and nothing improved. 

And then I found this place. I had wasted so much time. 

I had approached the deadbedroom as our problem to be solved together. But she had rejected that. So now it was her problem to solve. I would support her in any way, therapy (either on her own or a couple), space, books, whatever she wanted to find her libido, because I knew it was there.  I also gave her a time frame (a year) and a minimum target to reach: an average of twice a week. The consequence of not meeting that target was divorce. 

There were other elements to the conversation and there was some back sliding that nearly broke us, but she's doing much better now than pretty much most of our marriage. 

My advice: keep it simple. Do this. By then. Or this will happen. Try to keep emotions out of it, he can't reach a target of 'I want to feel desirable.' Be encouraging 'I will help you in any way, but you have to get to the target.' And finally don't accept excuses. I'm so tired from work... I'm so stressed. 'I'm not going to address the why unless you want to explore solutions. If you're tired, get more sleep. If you're stressed do something to de-stress like exercise or meditation. I'm not going to accept any more reasons for not having sex. If it's not going to be resolved, tell me now and we can go straight to the consequences. '

Mystics and artificers can heal if they choose healing options (it's not a horrible idea to let them know that they no longer have a dedicated healer, if that mattered to them when making their characters). I've played with mystics before, and assuming you are talking about UA mystics, they actually turned out to be some of the most potent healers in the group, overshadowing clerics and bards. Necromancers can end up with a ton of damage sponges. And honestly, it might help them to have a melee character who can help protect others and has lots of options to keep themselves alive--evasion, dodging as a bonus action, stunning foes, etc.

If you're worried about it, give them access to healing potions and let them drink them as a bonus action. Make short rests more attainable. Give them a wand that lets them spend charges to cast cure wounds. They'll really be fine, but there's lots of things you can do to give them some emergency healing if they need it.

Hell why do you even need special prospecting tools.  Go to linkedin (even better if you have navigator, no excuses if you don't), go find that prospect (..it should go without saying you better know what determines a good prospect in your space/service).

Then pratically stalk that person.  Google their name, find their social media presence, see if they've done any articles on industry websites, blah blah, etc.  If you can find a really good prospect, it only takes intuitive research that's easy to do without any special tools to figure out contact info, more trigger information, etc.

Then again im basing this off a single tweet, as are you. Perhaps he has done worse before and this was just the last straw, maybe this tweet is just 1 of many. Perhaps the punishment was fitting when you see the big picture.

This is the exact time to shame those who don't believe we can modernize our infrastructure because they think it is too expensive. This is the exact time to shame those who fantasize about secessionist and confederate lore. Look where it leads you.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","These are all good questions! I will answer as honestly as I can.

&gt; First of all, what do you think the source of existence?

No idea. Perhaps something is the default state instead of nothing. We don't know.

&gt; We know that there is something called Big Bang and everything started to exist after this moment, do you have any idea what caused it because as far as I know religions also have no scientific ideas, just stories.

We don't actually know that everything started to exist at this moment - only that our observable universe did. There are still theories and speculation about a greater cosmos or multiverse that could have existed before our universe did. But at the end of the day we don't know.

&gt; Secondly, do you personally believe in evolution?

I think evolution is true because the evidence for it is overwhelming.

&gt; What if the God created everything like this, animals being similar can be explained as ""God just changed DNA codes a little bit and created a new creature"". This also can explain the DNA similarity between creatures. I want to hear your thoughts on this.

Evolution through natural selection can explain how every organism is the way that it is without implying any intelligent guidance. Asserting that evolution was intelligently guided is an unnecessary step and ads no explanatory power to evolution that wasn't already there.

Consider this comparison: We know how birds fly because of our understanding of aerodynamics/physics. If someone said ""birds fly because of aerodynamics/physics but also because there is an intelligent supernatural force holding them up in the air."" The intelligent supernatural force is an unnecessary addition and offers no explanatory power, therefore it is likely not an accurate representation of reality.

Evolution works without assuming an intelligent power, so why assert that there was one?

&gt; Third, how did your family/friends reacted you when you first told them (if they know) you are an atheist now? How was the first reaction and what's the situation now?

My family was actually pretty chill about it. I think they are secretly hoping to convert me back over time. We are still on good terms and we don't let our differences get in the way.

&gt; Fourth, what makes you think life is valuable?

Putting a value on life is hard. Does a supernatural entity have to exist in order for life to have value? I don't think so. I find plenty of value in my life through family, friendships, experiences etc. ",1504224301

What do you do about the XIM4 on consoles?  The top guys on console use XIM's and have since the start.  Do people complain, yes, but not as much probably because many console players either don't know about it or just resign to saying PvP isn't ""competitive"" so who cares.







I agree that the PC landscape is different but I'm also confused how turning it off on PC and leaving consoles how they are as being a viable plan. It's clear that Bungie isn't interested in Destiny being an E-Sport, but I agree that it doesn't have to be for the game to still be competitive and everyone being on an even playing field. 






I think they are in a tough spot on this, perhaps just calling using a XIM cheating in pvp activities across the board, detecting it, and then banning it is the best course of action.

OR trying to provide for one's self or one's family, whereas women have a lot more support networks for getting food and housing assistance. There's also a lot more DV shelters for women, whereas there's nearly none for men.

&gt;While some murders are motivated by anger, many are not.

Most murders, I would guess, are related to gang activity, which is likely more related to poverty and neighborhood than anything else.

&gt;I think society accepts male violence when it's done in self defense or **as revenge**, but not initiated male violence.

We make look the other way more when it comes to revenge, but its hardly passed over in the vast majority of cases.

&gt;To the contrary people are more willing to forgive a woman for a violent act than a man, particularly when it comes to domestic violence. Or if a mother kills her child, many will defend her and say she must be insane, but if a father does he is a monster.

Agreed.

There's a whole subreddit designed around women getting away with stuff that men do not.

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","Lie detector, gossip, ratings rags, the media spin. 

&amp;nbsp;

What always, always suckers me in is the scent of injustice via the cops/investigators. Every time. I see cases all over the place and mostly ignore them...feel bad for the victims but just observe and move on. Same with Forensic Files, Dateline, etc. Just watch.

&amp;nbsp;

I get the media presented overview, the talking points of the cops, then watch the families on tv...then inevitably somebody will start pointing to the main suspect and it'll be like, ""police haven't found a murder weapon, aren't sure where the crime was committed, there are no witnesses, but police suspect this guy even though he has an alibi"" and that's where I'm like NOPE, FUCK THIS, you can't go after somebody without evidence, morons.

&amp;nbsp;

So, after all the spin, the first thing I do is return to the scene of the crime. I ignore witness statements after the fact. I try to first collect all the actual crime scene documents and photos taken of the scene and the event. Get the witnesses, their statements, etc. I don't care what they said 2 years later during a trial, or how they acted 3 days after the homicide...I focus exclusively on ""the night of"" and see what naturally surfaces. I make my own list of suspects and try to corroborate or refute their statements. 

&amp;nbsp;

Then I do what most people don't do. I try to prove the suspects guilty and then try to prove them innocent following. It's a great exercise to avoiding tunnel vision. 

&amp;nbsp;

I do look at psychology a lot. 

&amp;nbsp;

I collect but usually don't put any stock in character statements unless there's a verifiable basis of truth: Well, Joe was always beating up his girlfriends...or...he was a drunk.... or...yeah he went  out of town that weekend. If there's nothing in the case files that prove he beat up prior girlfriends, was an alcoholic, or went out of town, I ignore it. 

&amp;nbsp;

I ignore affairs as a standard practice. Cheating is more common than marriage...there are very few couples anymore who haven't cheated at some point. Just having an affair isn't motive. If there's a string of behavior that suggests a reason to off the spouse then I'm more than happy to look.

However, we haven't gotten a phantom thief HoH in...a long time. My predictions were Halphas, Chamie, Louis, and Natalie if Com2Us is feeling generous. I could use lich skill ups, but since I need absolutely no PT's(I own none) I think Louis is what we're actually going to get.

Keynes believed in 1) State control of the economy and 2) A graduated income tax (which is plank five of the ""Communist Manifesto"") and 3) Redistribution of wealth.

* Footnote: Another Fabian socialist (and great friend of Keynes) was author H.G. Wells. In his 1899 book ""Anticipations,"" he writes about the destabilizing effect of the Middle Class. He says that, historically, the rich have always existed, as well as the poor. The only new factor that challenged the authority of the elite was the burgeoning Middle Class (created by the new wealth generated by the Industrial Revolution). Wells said that the best course was to siphon off the wealth (and political power) of the Middle Class by introducing a graduated income tax. Just as Wells, Keynes was a big believer in the graduated income tax, and how it MUST be instituted in Western countries. Watch a presentation on H.G. Wells' ""Anticipations"" here where they discuss the graduated income tax (as backed by both the Fabian socialists and Karl Marx): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3vFIwSBsFg",1504224306

It does mean the dog is walking you rather than you walking the dog though (again, there's nothing wrong with that if that's a relationship you're happy with).

What happens if you want to go one way and the dog wants to go the other?  
If you give a quick &amp; gentle tug and the dog acquiesces then I'd say there's no real behavioral issues need resolving. 

Better still is that there's no tug involved and the dog senses the lead moving one way (long before it gets tight) and instantly follows. 

...even better still is there is no lead, the dog is walking to heel alongside and changes direction because you do with no prompting whatsoever.

*they shed. A lot. Invest in a Furminator comb, comb them every two days or so. Every time you do, you will get about a pillowcase full of hair.

*Get haircuts regularly. A long haired corgi is cute, trust me, but it can block their butthole, trapping poop in their fur. There is nothing worse than trying to wipe the ass of an angry corgi.

*never run around them. They are herding dogs, it's in their nature to bite heels. I lost so many jeans to my Corgis as a kid because I was a spaz who ran around a lot. Just let kids know ahead of time.

*give them a good diet, more so than other dogs since they can get some serious problems. Being overweight and having a bad diet leads to pancreas problems, which leads to diabetes, which leads to blindness due to cataracts caused by diabetes. The face he makes eating Bacon is cute, but it isn't cute in the long run.

*They are assholes. Stubborn assholes. Either keep them as a one house dog, or pair them with a dog who doesn't mind being pushed around. Two Corgis that were not raised together is asking for trouble, as they both want to be the boss. My Corgi almost ripped off my Grandfather's corgi's ear in a half hour of being alone together. They are sweet and fluffy, but they are assholes.

*don't spoil them. They are super cute, I know, but don't spoil him. This is true for all dogs, but it is the one tip no one listens to.",1504224311

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It's not apples to oranges but you're comparing two different types of apples. H1Z1 is a game based on fast paced, gun skill, and movement oriented gameplay. PUBG is centered around what loot you have and if you can be the first to hide behind something before other players start moving from the safe zone closing.

If anything, the PUBG engine is inferior. There is no manipulation to be had. Drop shotting was the only thing I've ever seen good players use and I don't even see that anymore (maybe because they patched it? I honestly don't know I don't read the patch notes). H1Z1 has always had engine manipulation. There have always been small quirks that only skillful and experienced players pick up on and are able to utilize. The first thing I've heard the majority of people say when they begin playing PUBG is that it feels very similar to Arma. Arma does not cater to movement or gun skill.

With that said, PUBG probably is a better investment for the majority of casual players. It has a lower skill ceiling so it's definitely friendlier to new players and it's not as fast paced. Bluehole overall are definitely better developers too. That combined with the fact that it's pretty new means there's still a lot of (most likely good) changes to come. For instance, Daybreak is such a mess that they've barely made 2 working maps in the 3-some odd years the game has been out and Bluehole is already nearing the end of producing 2 more maps, just months after release.",1504224312

Also make sure and question what it is you take in as and call ""proof"".

Those channels are themselves often faulty.  There are a lot of very real phenomena in existence that defy what in simple human terms can be ""proven"".

It's unrealistic to think someone could be such an awful person but still somehow fuck whoever they want (even if its a guy way out of their league) and still have a group of besties to kick around.

I'm fine with less than perfect female characters. But if she is going to be a bitch, at least acknowledge it like Nikki from OITNB or Yang from Greys Anatomy. This whole ""she's not perfect but she is totally relatable and a free spirit"" Lena Dunham type stuff is fucking stupid.

No, your word shouldnt be paid but rather EARN. Women EARN less than men because, historically, they dont work as much. 
They have more time off work, and generally dont work for as many hours a week than a lot of men. 
They EARN less because they CHOOSE to take maternity leave. They CHOOSE to be a stay at home parent.

We can cherry pick stats all day but on the flip side, this expectation that men will EARN more pigeon holes them into being providers and when they cant do that they are prone to suicide, that is why the ratio is 2:1. No one wants to address this problem though do they?

Kibble is way too high in carbs for an obligate carnivore like a cat (kibble is ~30% carbs and a cat needs about 3% carbs, max). Free-feeding is also completely against a cat's physiological needs and instincts - they are hunters, not grazers, and are not designed to consume from a continual food source. It really can screw up their guts and can eventually lead to conditions such as IBS and megacolon.


http://catinfo.org/


For her long-term health, get rid of the kibble entirely. It does no good and in fact causes harm - the only benefit kibble has is human convenience. Switch her to scheduled mealtimes of canned/wet food, two or three times a day as schedule permits.

"canada","t5_2qh68","The residential schools have been called a form of ""cultural genocide"" (i.e. forced assimilation), which is *not* the same thing as ""genocide"".  Unfortunately, a lot of people (including CBC) casually accuse MacDonald of ""genocide"", which is inaccurate.  

The case can be made that MacDonald was a willing architect of forced cultural assimilation.  He did not view natives as sub-human and even had native friends.  However, he did view traditional native culture as something preventing them from successfully integrating with the rest of Canadian society.  In MacDonald's era, natives raised as traditional hunter-gatherers had insufficient territory to be self-supporting and had to be supported by the state. Natives who integrated with European culture were a lot more likely to be productive citizens *by European standards*.  We now consider this culturally insensitive attitude to be deeply wrong, but it's not the same thing as believing race made natives inferior and then deliberately setting out to kill them all.  

If you care one whit about accuracy, you can call John A Macdonald a proponent of *cultural* genocide.  If you care two whits or more, you'll probably use the term ""forced assimilation"" instead, because it's a lot less likely to be contracted to something that's outright false by those who don't care about accuracy.   

Edit: It is worth noting that genocide has happened on Canadian soil.  e.g. The Thule wiped out the Dorset, quite literally, [without any genetic remnants to indicate interbreeding or assimilation](https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/dorset-dna-genes-trace-tale-arctics-long-gone-hobbits-n191156).  Sadly, genocide has not been an infrequent occurrence in history.  It has happened everywhere, and it's likely that the ancestors of any living population wiped out some other population at some point in the past. ",1504224323

LOL. Africa is doing great with their Chinese partnerships. Much better than they did with their European and American deals.

&gt; After China is done with Africa there will be nothing but a ravaged environmental disaster that remains.

Another prediction which will be proven to be completely wrong. That's because your predictions seems to be based on race and not facts.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Every tank can handle KJ mechanics. There is nothing that is really extremely hard about KJ tanking mechanics except soaking Armageddons during intermission where Paladins and DK's suffer since they have no target to keep up mitigation. Hell if we are talking about just tank mechanics, DK's have Vampiric blood for fel claws, and Rune Tap for Armageddon. 

If tanking mechanics were the reason why Druid was being taken then more guilds by now would have used non druid tanks. People are swapping over to alts they may not be very good at because even a mediocre druid is better than the best of the other classes. It also doesn't help that druid is probably the easiest tanking class to play.

In NH the world 9th kill was tank by a DK and Monk. Dk was really bad back then and Druid was even stronger than it is now. 

If the problem was Druid being too good or the tank mechanics favouring druid playstyle more than every other tank, eventually you could outgear the points where other tanks wouldn't survive. You can't outgear a roar. 

I find it pretty unfair that Druids get access to roar. It's never not useful. Yet as a DK my only raid utility is death grip/ Gorefiends grip. Yet 90% of all the mobs in this expansion are ungrippable or shouldn't be gripped. Because having a mechanic that really favours a single tank class is unfair except when the tank class it favors is Druid apparently.

I also find it pretty piss poor that the tanking class with the weapon that was designed with a single purpose, to kill Kil'jaeden, only has a single kill on the boss.",1504224327

WR: 19

WR: 11

TE: 10

Total: 40

Or 

WR: 19

WR: 13

TE: 6

Total: 38

Sure, the WR in the second team gets more points than the TE in the first team. But the first team got more points. The question is whether you will get a WR or RB later in the draft that is less of a downgrade than an earlier TE would be an upgrade. 

If there are lots of WR2s and few TE1s, taking the TE1 is often a better pick even if they score fewer points than a WR2. 

Your logic would only make sense if every position was flex.

I do my best to find little things I like about myself and focus on those. I work to change what I don't like. Looking back, I know in my heart of hearts I could not have stayed the way I was. Anything is better than that. Hair, eyebrows and skincare. Those are my passions now. I look like a femme guy and I'm cool with that. But I'm not giving up. I'm hopeful that one day I'll look in the mirror and see something I like and actually feel good about myself. Even if it takes the rest of my life. Someone half my age will progress much much faster. I'm willing to wait as long as it takes. Hang in there and love yourself, especially when you're most critical about your appearance.

The villains are actually the unlucky ones, from what I've seen, and they lose to the heroes mostly because, from what is shown, the heroes get formal training, while the villains don't. Shimura, a villain who got some kind of training from another villain, is one of the most dangerous characters in the show.

It's not really fair to apply the theme of Worm to another show like MHA because, despite sharing the same superhero gimmick, they still have very different themes.

B) he does it but not because he wants to.  This can cause resentment or arguments and what happened to consent?

"AskEngineers","t5_2sebk","You're on the right track. If you use an epoxy resin system, then you can use styrofoam for the core. Follow some standard practices for wet layups and vacuum bag the whole thing. 

After de-bagging it and trimming the ends and the trailing edge of the airfoil, a bottle of acetone poured through the foam will dissolve it without harm to the fiber shell.

So that answers your question. 

My turn:  Why would you want to do this? For a wing that small, the weight savings is minor. A sandwich structure gets you more stiffness and impact resistance. If you run the numbers, it might even be better to leave the foam core and use less layers of fiber.  Also, I don't know what current practice is, but given the speeds of race cars and the possibility of rocks flying up and damaging the wing, causing unpredictable airflow, I'd wrap it in a single layer of Kevlar satin weave cloth. Again, minimal weight but a huge gain in durability.

One other tweak: You'll find it difficult to get the unidirectional fibers that flow the length of the airfoil to stay straight during the layup process. This adds deviation from the designed performance. An easy way to fix this it to cut the unidirectional fibers a lot longer that the airfoil and stretch/hold them straight with weights. When the outer layers are complete, they will hold the unis in place while you carefully remove the weights from both ends and trim the unis to length before bagging the layup.

Just some thoughts from a guy that used to build with this stuff every day.

Oh, and styrofoam can be hot wired into the airfoil shape. 

Get over to the website of aircraft spruce and specialty:  http://www.aircraftspruce.com/  They will sell you small quantities of aerospace grade materials.

Buy this book:  https://www.amazon.com/Composite-Basics-Andrew-C-Marshall/dp/0966454049 

Buy this book:  https://www.amazon.com/Moldless-Composite-Sandwich-Aircraft-Construction/dp/B000BUJP5A

These guys built a lot of wings over their careers and never had defense contract money with which to do it. They've built a lot of homebuilt airplanes. I've met them both, used their methods, and am certain you'll be able to experiment with the airfoil design without having to live out of your car to pay for it.

Do make some prototypes out of glass fibers first instead of graphite. No sense wasting good graphite while learning how to manually control the layup and bagging process.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","but red pill theory is treating the behavior of women as scientifically manipulable, continuously repeatable. It also crudely categories men as alpha or beta; red pilled or blue pilled. That is a method of natural science, refusal to recognize presence of dynamics of men and women. To not believe that genuine and honest men could win the heart of women, to not believe white women to have chastity.

&gt;On average, two-thirds of those experiments could not be replicated

?????????????????????????????

Then does that mean these red pill theories are also highly probably trash?

Then who dictates they are more important to read than the lists deleted by the mods? What is mod's standard of filtering?

Could red pilled and blue pilled observations be equally valid?

The article you site suggest the flaws of peer review. But the posting and deleting of TRP on this subreddit by the mods is also a process of peer review, is it not?

&gt;The scientific endeavor essentially hinges on trust, or faith, due to the high costs of confirming or disconfirming testimony. 

but TRP subreddit also hinges on redditors' trust or faith on mod's selection of articles.

&gt;Trust only yourself, gather your own evidence, think for yourself.

but I interact with women and some of them are in complete paradox with red pill theory.

"creativecoding","t5_2w6qf","That's a tough one. Learning design isn't as linear and quantifiable as code. I don't know of any bootcamps and doubt there will be. Code bootcamps can promise a base level skillset for employment. Take a look at the vast armies of graphic designers that graduate each year. There is an ample supply of designers.

What I can suggest is to start with the style guides of large companies and spend time looking at the SMALL decisions they made. Not the color or shape of the logo, but colors for related elements. Those tertiary decisions are where design meets practicality.

Good software design usually succeeds through balance and harmony.  It gets pretty esoteric and that's why design courses spend a lot of time on theory. You don't hear much about ""right answers"". Like the best font is _______ and the perfect complement to blue is _______ .

"F35Lightning","t5_33swv","I don't have full access to the article just yet, but here's what Lara Seligman (the author) had to say on Twitter:

&gt;[This is just the initial load - final Block 3F software will give #F35 a full suite of air-to-air &amp; air-to-ground weapons, including AIM-9X](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/903321175799029760)

-

&gt;[Final 3F will be released this fall, but the jets won't be cleared for combat until DOD completes the 3F MDFs \(aka the threat data library\)](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/903322758360248320)

-

&gt;[Good question! Basically the jets are 3F capable, but currently limited to 3i flight envelope and weapons until they get *final* 3F](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/903324251339583488)

-

&gt;[I'm saying the 3F MDFs are not complete yet, and the jets are not cleared to use AIM-9X yet in combat - source USAF](https://twitter.com/laraseligman/status/903345333433925634)

""Final 3F will be released this fall"" from the second tweet and specific mention of the AIM-9X suggests that this is what Bogdan was talking about in February (note that the timeline has shifted a few weeks / about a month left since then):

http://docs.house.gov/meetings/AS/AS25/20170216/105552/HHRG-115-AS25-Wstate-BogdanC-20170216.pdf#page=6

According to that opening statement document, The F-35A would only be lacking the AIM-9X, whereas the F-35B and F-35C would be lacking their full flight envelope until early next year (AFAIK, due to additional testing required with prolonged afterburner use [such as when they're trying to hit Mach 1.6] previously damaging the stabilators).

So either way, according to Lara the F-35A will have a final version of Block 3F this fall anyway (October or more likely November). I'm not 100% certain if the Mission Data Files (MDFs) will be completed at that time as well, but at least they'll have all of the in-built features up and running. Upgrading an ""initial Block 3F"" jet to a ""final Block 3F"" jet will just be a software patch as well, so it should happen fairly quickly.",1504224336

Whether you have a good time or not, you're programmed to feel a certain way.. and it's related to sex, girls, bar, the scene, etc.. it's all tied together subconsciously.

Then again, ""10th level spell slots"" aren't a thing elsewhere in 5e, which seems to imply ""no."" Not exactly helpful, I know...

My reading is that this is a case of ""specific beats general,"" and because the description states, without listing exceptions, that spell slots count as one level higher, *and* bearing in mind that we're talking about a frickin' *artifact,* I'd rule that yes, if you burn a 9th level slot, you can treat the spell as dealing damage as if it were cast at an imaginary 10th level.

The first question to ask is: if you could solve these problems, would you keep the puppy? 

If the answer is yes, put a reasonable deadline on them. When should she be fully potty trained by? When should she learn to play gently by? When does your boyfriend expect to be able to reduce his hours or shift them so that he's around in the afternoon? If you can't achieve that by the deadline, find a new home for the pup. If you can, great! Problem solved.

If the answer is no, find a new home for the pup. You've already given this a genuine chance to succeed. Puppies need time and attention and there's no need to feel guilty if you need to find someone else to give that to them.

BIG EDIT: Now Gogo would be put to the Break Zone after an effect that resolves as a result of ""flickering"" the only unit back in again via Time Mage or playing a unit in lieu of itself (Palom or Porom 1 cost) if that is the only unit on the opposing field

Reason is for the split state that there was no unit on the field mid-resolution, you triggered Gogo's ability (which contrary to belief, is an auto-ability) and therefore is placed on the stack.

This is why this interaction would occur and why Kageyama has confirmed it so.

"Ayahuasca","t5_2s8ss","From one who lives with awakened kundalini, it is NOT a belief system, there are many people who awake their kundalini that have no preconceived beliefs about it. Spontaneous awakenings do occur, but most happen through meditation, yoga, or drugs.

Far from being a placebo effect. Whether the OP has awakened kundalini or not, is undetermined, but the similarities of her experience and a kundalini crisis can't be ignored since they are both involving an energy crisis. It is the reason why people may think it is kundalini, but it doesn't always equate. In both situations your energy exceeds your ability to process it properly in body and you have issues like a wandering mind (like medusa's snakes), aches in the body, pressure, mixed emotions on different layers, disconnection to the world and who you were, emotional swings, constant background of fear or anger that can trip your wires into intense fear or anger from external stimuli, depression, anxiety, and a lot of other shit. I went through it once, recovered, and now going through it again on deeper levels. These are just the negatives, there are positive aspects also.

What fixes this is working on the body and mind through meditation and yoga, and breath-work. The idea is to clear the pathways that energy/consciousness travels so that it can run smoother. An energy healer would help alleviate some symptoms and would be helpful, a reflexologist or zone therapy may help also for relief. But the biggest help is meditation (twice a day), and something physical like yoga or body-lifting or weightlifting. Breath-work like cross breathing would help also. This will help manage it all and bring it more under control. It needs to be practiced consistently and in time, symptoms will subside.",1504224344

Not sure how young you are or how much experience you have with it, but try not to make the act itself such a big deal. Obviously use protection/contraceptives to eliminate that anxiety of baby making as well as do it with the right person. But yeah. It doesn't need as big of a pedestal as some people give it.

&gt; When used with the Mavic Pro Platinum, up to 4dB (60%) of aircraft noise is lowered during takeoff and landing

If 4 decibels is 60% of the aircraft noise during takeoff and landing, that means that the total noise the aircraft produces is 6.667 decibels. That's not right.

When I'm alone in a quiet room, the sound of my own heart beating is louder than 6 dB. Even the sound of a mere pin dropping produces only about 10 dB of noise. A loud toilet flushing can be around 75 dB and I suspect the Mavic produces about as much noise.

Not to minimize the importance of having shelters for the homeless in the first place, but we all know why it's headed to Vanier - gotta clean up the Market for the yuppies who dropped 300K+ on their Claridge condos, and you sure don't want to put those things in the places that will see tons of land appreciation over the next ~10 years.

Which is why you get stupid studies like the one the OP shared. Yeah no shit, you build things and you provide services and you will get more economic activity.

"traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns","t5_2uog0","That sucks.  Still, if you live on your own, and are willing to clean up messes or take measures to contain messes, there's a few things you could use as improvised vibrators.  Certain toothbrushes, for example, have motors to make brushing easier.  Do you want to know what makes a vibrator?  A motor makes a vibrator.  You'll want to make sure you clean off the head throughly (both before and after use); that said, they tend to be weaker, so they are really only good in a pinch.  [My vibrator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Shibari+mini+halo+vibrator&amp;t=h_&amp;ia=products) has a decent motor (good enough to get me making soft, lewd noises when used right), good battery life, and you can get one for less than $30, making it something to consider when you get income.  It doesn't give the Earth-shattering orgasms I've heard from the old Magic Wands, but it should be enough.

If you don't have lube, you probably shouldn't do anal.  Instead, one thing to try for getting at your prostate is jamming your (improvised) vibrator on your taint.  You'll probably know when you've hit it, if you didn't lose the anatomical lottery more than most trans women, as it's incredibly sensitive.  It also has the bonus of making you feel more feminine, since it's a long object pressed up against where a vagina would normally be, it's easier to imagine being fucked that way.

The global ult is definitely a playmaker, and I like the mention of Dragon Shire as a map where its utility can shine. Being able to assist a gank in toplane while clearing enemy mercs in botlane sounds very powerful!

I too am worried about high mobility characters, whiffing your chain is very punishing as it puts you out of combat until it's up again basically. But Uther also deserves mention as a counter, with Guardian of Ancient Kings heavily mitigating KT's combo damage, while his stun can be used to follow up on a dive. 

Overall it's hard to say whether he will make an impact on the pro scene. Only time will tell whether his combo and his damage are enough to compensate for his weakness to dive and difficulty to execute.

I also had the added context of playing A Link to the Past on SNES since before kindergarten, so seeing the graphical improvements and experiencing the new gameplay elements blew my fucking mind. I believe I beat OOT fifteen times in about 8 years, and master quest twice. It was one of my favorite games of all time.

I hadn't played in about 7 years, so last year I picked it up recently and felt nothing more than a tickle of nostalgia, and a great sense of my time being wasted.

&gt; 
Please do not argue with the rules of the Code of Conduct. **The reason we do not allow users to tamper with or alter game client files is for the sake of the game's stability, it is not at all due to what the mod does in result.**

&gt; Modding MechWarrior Online is simply not acceptable, even if you consider the mod to be non-advantageous against your opponents, and I hope you can understand how harmful such things could be for the whole community if they were acceptable, **just like the reasons LCPL 4 responded on this thread.**

Ok so she said it is about stability and not about unfair advantages, which doesn't make sense because how would a client side color change make the game unstable, but then she references what LCLPL 4 talked about. What did he talk about? Here:

&gt; I can understand not wanting the community being allowed.... **I can remember back to Rainbow Six days when people would modify the character textures to neon colors so they would stand out and make easier targets.** From a legal standpoint, if they allow something that goes against the Terms on a regular basis then the Terms would probably then not carry as much weight if they tried to enforce. Could be a slippery slope. Them not doing it probably more to do with time and money than just being (insert bad word here)s. 

 She seems to be talking about the slippery slope argument and how that might affect something in court. I seriously doubt they would take any modders to court instead of just banning anyone who used them and modifying the game to not allow client side modifications, which they already have done with certain user.cfg parameters.",1504224356

The fact that Russia hacked the DNC prior to the meeting, but held off releasing the emails until a month after the meeting (suggesting they may have coordinated on timing)

The fact that the FBI began investigating all of this a month later.

The fact that Trump fired the FBI director, and admitted it was because he was investigating Russia's interference.

The fact that Trump told Russian ambassadors after firing Comey ""I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off""

The fact that Trump has a ""disproportionate cross section of assets"" from Russia but continues to deny that he has anything to do with Russia at all.

The fact that Mueller has impaneled a grand jury to investigate all of this and is bringing in experts in foreign bribery, public corruption, people who prosecuted Watergate, among many, many others.

"bonehurtingjuice","t5_3jwwf","**Suppressor**

A suppressor, sound suppressor, sound moderator, or silencer is a device attached to or part of the barrel of a firearm or air gun which reduces the amount of noise and visible muzzle flash generated by firing. Suppressors are typically constructed of a metal cylinder with internal mechanisms to reduce the sound of firing by slowing the escaping propellant gas. (A flash suppressor specifically cools or disperses burning gases typically exiting from the muzzle of a carbine-length weapon, without reference to sound reduction.)

In most countries, silencers are regulated by firearm legislation to varying degrees. While some have allowed for sporting use of silencers (especially to mitigate the costs of hearing loss and noise pollution), other governments have opted to ban them from civilian use.

Además tenía el tema de mis familiares, que no quería desprenderme de ellos (no soy una persona muy social, por lo que valoro mucho a mis seres queridos). Y bueno, la chica era amorosa pero me pedía que viviera allá, que aprendiera el idioma y que revalidara el título de contador público; fue bastante excesivo.

El país es re seguro y tiene una buena época de inversiones, eso lo pude ver cuando visité Cracovia y Varsovia. El tema del idioma parece ser un bloqueo grande como para poder familiarizarse (fui a un carrefour express en un shopping y el cajero no podía decirme en inglés ""flaco, tenes que ir allá a pesar la fruta""). El racismo creo que es latente porque tengo entendido que hay muchos turcos y el choque cultural es importante para ellos.

"tableau","t5_2uolo","10.3 does introduce data-driven alerts, and they have value for simple use cases. But they are rather restrictive in that:

* Recipients cannot be dynamically determined, they must all be licensed Tableau Server users
* The condition for alerting must be expressed as a (1) visible (2) numeric (3) continuous (4) measure axis
* It only works for certain chart types
* The content of the email cannot be customized other than modifying the single dashboard image it sends
* It can't send SMS messages

Conversely, with VizAlerts, the alert type, the condition criteria, and the content sent is all determined dynamically based on fields from your data source. The fields are mapped to properties based on their names. It's sneakily integrated into the Subscriptions feature of Tableau Server, so you're only using Tableau Server, and probably Desktop, to build your alerts and schedule them.

I'll write up a more formal comparison of 10.3 data drive alerts and what VizAlerts does when I get a bit more time, I've been meaning to do that for a while.

There's a link to an admittedly poorly produced video on the main [GitHub](https://github.com/tableau/VizAlerts) page where you can see a bit about how it works.

Then he'd kick open the doors, upturning [collection plates](https://www.lakewoodchurch.com/pages/give.aspx) as he blazes down the aisle towards the stage.

Just like how religion or politics are a thing only when people mention it. It's that that person believes it is a valid observation/opinion based on their findings.

I, personally, would love to elaborate, but it's usually asking for a fight when on this type of online medium, but to elaborate, being white had nothing to do with the movie, but I can not think of any character that wasn't white off the top of my head.

What does that have to do with anything? Some people just don't want to watch because it puts white people in a spotlight. So? White people have to watch Asian movies put Asians in the spotlight/Black movies putting black people in the spotlight/Native American movies putting Native Americans in the spotlight/etc, why don't you just chill and like the movie and not make it about race?

All those racially purist movies were usually about historical representation and a narrative about their respective struggles, so if this were about white people being demonized in a minority population, I would have a different perspective on these things. But I am tired of writing an entire preface for my opinions.

It being white sucks because you can now forget about it and watch Big Hero No. 6, and relate to a character who lost his brother, is trying to salvage his family and extended family, and hits home for a lot of people who are moving to a new area/immigrating into the states. It having this lame muddy autumn 1950s warm filter color scheme was a terrible creative decision to put the whole movie in. And yes, there were night scenes, but nothing remarkable comes to mind.

Also, this is what death is? Death is not an unfamiliar concept and it being told for children has been approached before. Sure, this certainly brings the message across, but so does any other movie where a boy let's go of a memory. 

People letting go of Jesus. Bambi letting go of Mom. The boy from jungle book leaving behind his home to become a man. Tarzan re-assimilating into civilization. Lilo and Stitch letting go of their respective ways of life to salvage their current situation. Simba letting go of his Father. Luke forgiving the memory of his own father. etc etc ad nauseum.

Look, dude, I'm not shitting on you for liking the movie/holding it close to your heart. People out there love Naruto, My Little Pony, or something else kinda dumb looking. Hell Rick and Morty is kinda polarizing. But no one else really says anything against The Iron Giant. I googled it to try and validate my opinions, it's all praise.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","For most, and by that I mean those who own a Confederate flag but aren't marching and talking about white supremacy, the statues and flags represent more of a statement against progressive movement in this country.

To clarify, consider the gay marriage thing. That moved at LIGHT speed compared to previous movements. Civil rights for blacks took a 100-150 years, depending on your metric. Abortion was actually antithetical to feminists of the late 19th century, but liberalization of feminism began about the 1920s. A few decades later, we have abortion protected by a Supreme Court ruling.  

I realize gay marriage was not something that just cropped up in this decade, but it still moved much, much faster than any previous progressive movement. Now consider the conservatives... To be conservative is to hold to traditional norms, and change should be slow, if it comes at all. 

So the past ten years or so have seen a culture war that moves at a breath taking pace, those who don't agree with a progressive movement are automatically labeled racist, bigoted, homophobes. CEOs who hold to traditional views on anything are castigated in social media, which is stoked and fed by the mainstream media, their livelihoods are placed in jeopardy, their families targeted...

The statues are just the latest event in what these traditional people view as an all out assault against what always has been. Plus, you call someone who ISN'T racist, a racist long enough, and eventually they get sick of that shit and you end up with a Donald Trump. He's just a stick in the spokes of the bicycle wheel that is the leftist movement.

To summarize, it's distressing to these people. Full disclosure, I am from the south, pretty conservative with a few libertarian ideals (and one or two socially liberal views) but by and large, conservative in fiscal and all other social policies. I don't own a Confederate flag, sticker, anything. I did grow up with a romanticized view of the southern generals and leaders of the civil war. The slave part was the black mark on what was otherwise considered an honorable group of men who held more loyalty to their home State than a central govt. Right or wrong, there it is.

Now, we Southerners have to come to grips with how those symbols make another person feel and have an honest discussion about it. But a group of screaming people committing vandalism is going to set the worst of men to march with racist signs and chants, and the rest of us simply feel lost and homeless. We may not recognize the world we grew up in, and there's no discounting it is distressing to those people. Simply put, both sides need to calm down and talk. Violence or destruction on either side will only spark more hatred. ",1504224367

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You can't really say 'Yes, this scenario is always abusive"", because relationships aren't black &amp; white. This board is quick to call abuse. The reason I called this situation abusive is because you have no idea what actually happened to transfer ownership of your car. I still don't understand how this $1 to transfer thing actually worked.

That tells me you didn't have a clear understanding of what was going on, and that he pressured you into it. It's something that was against your financial interests, and in his favor. He took advantage of your inexperience &amp; naiveté. To me, that is abuse. 

Another thing this board is known for is recommending therapy. In your case, it's a good idea. If you've grown up in an abusive environment, it's hard to know if something is 'normal' or 'right'. Therapy can help recalibrate those instincts.

I think the only point is that for those new coming in, it looks like we're shooting down altcoin discussion, so it'll be harder for them to distinguish the excellence we had harbored before. You're right only those two subreddits will outright censor.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;According to the document you posted earlier, total private insurance spending is a little over $1T, and as I suggested earlier a significant portion of this is already paid for by tax money at some level.

Another $0.34T is out-of-pocket, and $0.25T is other third-party payers. Just looking at those alone already puts you at $1.6T.

&gt; You are correct that just shifting everything to government at the current level of spending is not sustainable, but our current per capita expenditure level is not sustainable either.

I'm not saying we should do nothing. Repealing the ESI exclusion would easily fund an expansion of medicaid to cover low-income people, and the reforms instituted by the ACA (mandatory coverage, pre-existing condition protections, and minimums on coverage) would support moving to a system where people can actually shop for insurance again (without having to switch jobs). One half step further by mandating any hospital receiving federal funds to publish their prices would allow insurers and patients alike to shop for care and drive prices down (87% of healthcare is non-emergency).

As of now, employers see a larger tax break if they spend more money on healthcare so there is no market pressure from anyone to keep prices down. Patients don't see prices, insurance companies have been contracted to pay out by default, and the people paying the insurance want to see premiums go up to reduce their payroll tax bill. If people could shop for their own insurance that would change (and, coincidentally, they would be able to shop for new jobs independent of health care considerations).

On top of all of that, based on how the government currently handles administration and pricing for medicaid, I find your faith in their ability to implement price controls to reduce costs while not completely squeezing providers a little ... optimistic.",1504224373

First off, Notyourshield was a twitter hashtag reaction to the suggestion that gamergate as a community was exclusively straight, white, male (and probably right wing). It was only around for a while, because quite frankly it was, as a hashtag activism instance, inherently flawed. 

Because it was trying to say something to a group of people who either didn't care that they were wrong or didn't believe they were right in the first place. They were simply trying to dismiss a diverse group by pretending it was both un-diverse and not fit to be considered part of the human race. 

Black Lives Matter is an entirely unrelated phenomenon. If you wish to debate whether they are a positive element in modern American society or a violent gang taking advantage of a real problem for their own gains, that's fair enough. It's an interesting topic. 

But it's not one that has any relation to Notyourshield. ",1504224374

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","Knowing a little about the Omaha market and the area in particular those homes are in, you are (1) underestimating the taxes/insurance, and (2) significantly over-estimating the rent. $2,000 gets you in a bigger home in a much nicer area with upgraded everything, in a house that would sell on the market for ~$350k. I know, because I just signed a lease on one. I couldn't justify buying under those circumstances. Home 1 would rent for between $1,200 - $1,500, and you can tell because vacant rental houses within blocks are currently on the market for that, each with 4 BRs. I don't point that out to invalidate your point, because your bigger picture is fine.

That aside, Mid Kayn is pretty good, he is a good roamer but I feel like he has too little kill pressure, especially on mages/assassin, they can shove you win most of the time or burst you really hard if you come too close.

That leaves him as a good pick against melee hypercarries in mid and some exceptions of Assassins (Yasuo, GP, Diana, those with a pretty shitty early game mostly that need items/levels to be able to do stuff), in which case I would say to go for it, you can get a pretty free lead early on if you shove with W and Q, and you can pressure the map better than them because of, as you said, Kayns roam potential.

If I ever do it I do it with Assassin-like Runes, 9,6 Lethality, 9,6 AD, Flat Armor Seals and Flat MR Glyphs to survive early game trades. Mobi's + Duskblade&gt; Youmuu's&gt; Situational.

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","[Specific genetic effects on phenotypes may be conditional on specific environments and thus be undetected in other environments. Similarly, exposure to specific environments are often influenced by choices that depend on the individuals' genetic make-up. Such interplay between genes and environment may channel individual development into different trajectories early in life and affect the long-term development of mental health and disorder. A shift from association studies targeting genetic main effects towards investigating the interaction of genetic and environmental influences is reflected by the accumulating evidence for such processes being reported in recent literature [99]. Important reports are emerging, describing the moderation of behavioural responses to early rearing conditions by specific genotypes. For example, in the Dunedin study, Caspi and colleagues found that links between childhood maltreatment and later psychological maladjustment were moderated by genetic factors [100].](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2753321/)",1504224375

Then the lawsuit name change and PG era happened and shits became shoots and mediocre garbage took over. Since around 2012 they've started to become much better again and even being a ""PG"" rating there slipping back into a TV14 Attitude Era style programming. Sadly what's happened in the last 2-3 years is with the breakup of The Shield you have Roman Reigns, who by all definition is mediocre as fuck and at best a Mid-carder, not a Main Eventer. However because Vince has such a goddamn hard on for the guy, he's being given opportunities he doesn't deserve including ""Retiring Undertaker"". To the point that they've brought Cena back to Raw to get this fucker Roman over.

As for a more specific argument though, it's quite simple: inter-human ethics are based on human culture, which serves the function of facilitating interaction between humans for the purposes of things like social utility and species propagation.

Of course, different cultures have different ethics which is why morality is essentially collective subjectivity. It's not based on an overarching, objective right or wrong, it's based on what most people think is right or wrong.

Animals aren't part of human cultures unless they're adopted into it, in which case they're treated as property of humans. Animals have no ability to participate in human culture and reciprocate our ethics, so it's illogical to simply extend them the exact same moral principles we do for each other.

However, we do have ethical guidelines for interacting with non-humans and our environment, called environmental ethics. In most cases, environmental ethics suggests that we should do our best to not interfere with the natural behaviours and ecosystems we see in the world. Humans are a part of this as we too are animals with natural behaviours and desires. Eating meat is a natural function of our omnivorous bodies, therefore it is ethically justifiable under environmental ethics.",1504224376

"soccer","t5_2qi58","&gt; The offside rule has changed several times, it was restricted to three players iirc.


So you went from ""it didn't exist"" to ""there must be three players""? I like the ""iirc"" as if you didn't just googled it.

So if it was three players, then it was even HARDER not to be in offside. Since if you were in front of only two players like now, it would be ruled offside.

It actually was two though, but ""being in the same line"" wasn't valid like it's now from what I can Google.

So either way, you bullshitted having no idea. And a point was rendered void.

&gt; Yes, it does. It's basic, free market economics . Individuals need incentives to excel their respective professions.

Everyone had the same incentives at that time. Only Pele did what Pele did.

How hard is to understand that?

&gt; You're proving my point, it makes them much better.


Your point is that newer is better. In 20 years, the best player in the world will be better than Messi and CR, and obviously much much better than Maradona and Pele, right?

Because technology improvements in the pitch, ball, shirts, socks, boots, health, training and so on will make it more and more easier to play, so if that's what makes them better, the rest doesn't matter.

It's a valid point of view, newer is better, sure.

My argument is about players playing in a context. How good was Pele compared to his peers and what he achieved.

Otherwise the comparison and discussion is moot, newer is better and in 10 years CR and Messi should be forgotten and the new kid will be 100% better.",1504224377

I haven't read through the entirety of those posts yet, but they're well-written and you'll likely find some useful information. [Edit:] For instance, the third one describes using the mount in manual mode.

There's also [this old listing on B&amp;H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/735581-REG/Sky_Watcher_S11300_Backpacker_80R_Telescope.html) for a package with what looks like the same mount, but slightly different scope. It provides some information about the mount, but it's not especially detailed and I'm not sure how much you may already have figured out:

&gt;The Sky-Watcher Backpacker 80R includes a multi-speed electronic hand-controller which controls the DC-Server motors on each axis, facilitating smooth, accurate vertical and horizontal movement on demand.

&gt;In tracking mode, the ""Guide"" speed, (1x), compensates for the Earth's rotation making stars stand-still. ""Slow"" speed, (4x), allows fine position changing to center objects in the eyepiece or viewfinder. ""Fast"", (8x), speed allows relatively quick gross incremental changes in location. With the tracking mode turned off, the guide speed accelerates to 32x; ""Slow"" speed to 64x; and ""Fast"" becomes a speed-demon at 800x. This allows the flexibility to transverse huge swaths of sky or terrestrial landscape in just a matter of seconds.

Hope this helps even a little!",1504224378

That's a magic bullet, those dont exist. Think of the roll of violence in human history and how vastly different it would be if violent altercations had a simple off switch like that. That isn't in line with reality. A lot of the self defense ""moves"", the ""You grab me, I wrist lock you."", you'll see being taught are magic bullets, things often not being taught the same way they can actually be used or at best things that don't help you in a fight, but can help you when you're being violently harassed before an inevitable fight and are willing to risk legal trouble throwing the first punch.

The best thing you can do is get yourself proper instruction in a place like an MMA, Boxing, Muay Thai, Russian Sambo, Judo or BJJ gym or a Krav Maga place that has regular full contact sparring. 

Sparring is the important thing because it means you're actually learning to fight by actually fighting in a context where that's as safe as is reasonable to expect.

Because of the way that our brains work, people start at the left and follow down the hill until the man is there (because he stands out), then we look at was he's looking at and then from there it should loop to the right so we can see the rest of the piece. The problem with the signature is that it makes your eyes go back to the left side before even seeing the right side, because of its high contrast and the fact that it is so close to the most recent thing we were looking at.


I would suggest either moving the signature to the bottom right or making it a lighter color that the city, so that the city and the spaceship take us to the right (and the rest of the image).",1504224381

I walk the same way to work/university every single day because it's longer and gives me time to think while burning calories, but he thinks that that's stupid because it takes too long and ""why wouldn't you just take the shortcut?"" Um, maybe it's because I DON'T WANT TO AND THERE IS NO ONE RIGHT WAY TO WALK TO CAMPUS FROM MY APARTMENT. I'm always wrong, I'm always stupid, I'm never doing anything right, and he makes me want to curl up and hide. I thought he was a friend but he's an insensitive asshat a majority of the time.

If there's content it is likely that they are actively serving a purpose even if indirectly. 
 
Until you are certain just renew the services. If you don't have a competent person that you intimately trust, I suggest you ask for a paid assessment from a professional. for the kind of assessment you need right now all this person needs is a list of domains, this will be sufficient to provide you with a report into what purpose, if any, each domains serves. Do not provide them with account passwords at this time. It may also be safe to ask this assessment from two independent parties, to make sure no one tries to pull off anything dodgy.

As someone who's also been toying around with the idea of a BLU tank GDD I used it as a 90s cooldown/30% single skill reduction on an attack, but you had to be hit by it. Meaning you would ""learn"" what's coming and be better prepared for it the next time. I.e. Say you get hit by a tank buster while 'learning', the next tank buster that hit you would be reduced by 30% dmg. On a 90s cooldown you'd be able to reduce about 1/3rd to half of the tank busters and it'd be completely ineffective on things like boss final/limit break attacks which are meant to be devastating.

It would also make the multihit attacks like ahk morne still as effective since only 1 hit of it would be reduced.

Kinda hijacking a reply but I'd be interested to know where you fall in this kinda skill usage. Maybe we could swap some design ideas",1504224389

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","The landlord-tenant relationship is historically an exploitative one, though it may not feel that way to you, because in modern-day capitalism both of you are being exploited.

The whole concept of rent only exists because a large population of the working class can't afford to take risks. As I'm sure you know, houses most of the time are considered liabilities rather than assets. So, you work hard, save your money, take these risks, assume these liabilities, and charge rent to folks. Naturally, you feel entitled to do so because you worked hard for this property and you're taking the risk. So, the workers rent your houses and pay for your mortgage (and a little more most likely) so that you can have passive income, and so that they have a place to live without worrying about things like foreclosure.  

The real winners here are the bank and the insurance companies. The poor stay poor, because they've thrown away half their income on rent, and they get their money back from you in due time.

The banks don't care if your home is empty, either. They still want their money. Here's a fun fact for you, empty homes in America outnumber the homeless 6:1. Greed is too incentivized in our current system.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","Well I did kinda explain why there weren´t that many rebellions. They start in the people. When they feel oppresed, and comparing your average Serb and Croat back then is night and day.
By the time nations become a thing rebellion is kinda pointless. What could we have done vs AH? The only real way to fight was terror.

I know that part of your history quite well. Petar Snačić was elected by them, but he died fighting the Hungarians during the battle of Gvozd, after which Koloman was fully elected king. This is where we would likely persisted fighting. Actually we would of likely stood behind our man from the beginning.

And this brings me into the next part. What you did was smart. Peacefully integrating you spared yourself the bloodshed and potential mistreatment that would of insued.
And yes, you did smartly manover through all those states, which is something many of us Serbs despise. People look at you as essentially a snake. It´s where a good portion of the insults come from.In a sense you just used Yugoslavia as a ticket from the losing AH side to our winning side, since you knew what would of happened. And people here still curse King Alexander for allowing you to. And yes, Croat ultranationalists that go on about the war, defending their sovereignty and hate us but love AH are rather funny. Which is also so strange to me. You love your country and its independence yet you miss an old empire?

Now for you comparison, there is a problem. In it we´re compared to Finland, but that doesn´t work, they´re rich, we´re poor. Both them and the US are rich, despite on ruling the world and one never having their own state before 1917. One of the main points of mine was in the case of us having and empire I´d be far richer than I am today. It´s true that you don´t have to be an empire to get rich, being smart will do. Thing is, our actually history has a lot to do with us being poor. The Ottomans are an obvious reason for most of the Balkans woes. It turned the place into a backwards shithole by the end of the 19th century, but the wars this all caused didn´t help either. The war in 1878, the Balkan wars, WWI. All of this before complete independence. The country can´t develop in such an environment. And then of course WWII. The most peace we had was like 60 years in the 19th century, half of which was spent as an Ottoman vassal. Of course an empire would of waged war, but how much would be on our actual land, and how much in the conquered lands and colonies? People asked why IKEA came to be in Sweden and not some Serbian village. The answer is simple, at the time you didn´t have Germans occupying that Swedish village and shooting people up. My point is when we wage war it hits home. Shits gets destroyed, compared to waging war in a far away land.
And while Germany never had quite the empire, it was a great power. Be it as the HRE and latter Prussia, it was always a great power.
My point overall was, what would I value more. Riches and power in the worlds, or my current pride. I´m 10x better in the first scenario, yet it still feels wrong.

The function of such an intelligence is to alter its inner states (the random variables inside the Blanket, the brain states or belief encodings) so as to decrease the conditional entropy of the sensory states given the inner states -- to predict its sense-data Bayes optimally.

Action then minimizes this same cost function, but possibly with respect to a ""normative"" inner state.

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","Speaking from my personal experience, there are two factors involved (ignoring cost/availability of instruments and strings).

* Mentally, you have to re-learn which string is which, so when you're looking for a ""G"" you can find one instinctively.

* There are some practical physical differences.

The mental transition from 4 to 5 (or 6) is like learning to drive on the other side of the road in a different country.  You just have to re-accustom.  It will take a few days the first time, but it soon feels natural.  It gets easier, but I find it's still not instant, it still takes me an hour to get comfortable when I swap. 

The physical factors are:

1. More strings = more ""wrong"" options when you go looking for a string in a hurry. 

2. On the 5 or the 6, the strings are closer together, so you have to be more precise.

3. In practice, you won't use the low-B or high-C very often, but you still have to deal with their presence.  But one is far more inconvenient than the other.

The low-B doesn't really get in the way at all.  It sits down the bottom and you can ignore it apart from the fact that you have to deaden it all the time.  That just becomes instinct, your right hand thumb just rests on the E and the B instead of the E.  No big deal there.

The high-C is the stinker.  It's less convenient to deaden with the right hand IMHO.  But far more importantly, your left (fretting) hand now has to reach over one extra string for EVERY note you fret.  It's a perpetual nuisance.  You left hand has to stretch further and work harder every minute that you play.

Personally, I decided that the benefits of the 5-string easily outweighed the minor inconveniences.  I ended up selling my only 4-string and building up a collection of 5's. Just because it's easier to play a 5 all the time and not deal with the mental transition back to 4.

But I wasn't prepared to do the same for the 6th string.  The extra physical strain that it puts on my left hand was just too much of a price to pay for every-day playing.  I do have a 6, but I only pull it out when I have a specific piece that I want to play, and I accept that fact that it will take me an hour or two to re-adjust.

The low-B is great to have.  Plenty of songs use that Eb, D or even the C.  More importantly, there's lots of times where the extra string allows me to work up on the 5th or 6th position based on the B string, instead of needing play it down in open string or 1st position in the E.",1504224395

Feint lots of charges, and instead of blocking trust your dodge frames so you can go into the bash, instead of initiating a hit to go into dash. Your entire game should be Observe-Counter-Attack and get the opponent out of stamina as best you can, then make them guess.",1504224400

Also, the argument of Twitch being OP and not being picked in the LCS/in pro play is a huge deal. Pro players make a living of winning against others. Who would be dumb enough to pick worse champions when an OP one (in this case - according to your statement - Twitch) is available?

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I'm too lazy to read your wall of text so I will try and answer your TLDR questions. 

1. There are 100+ champions in the game that you can possibly play against or play with. I think it is best to grasp the idea of every single champ and lane before focusing on something.
2. This is a more advance subject as many game factor plays a role into it. I can get more specific if you want, but I think in general, both these options work. Matchup plays the most important factor. However bullying is generally more risky and can backfire if you are not playing correctly.
3. I've never really played dota so based on your question, I assume ""school"" just means the type of damage output you do. In league, champs are very linear and are generally most effective doing either magic damage (AP) or physical damage (AD). You can just search up guide/build of the champion you are playing. In terms of team comp, yes it is best to be diverse in damage source.
4. I don't main assassins so my advice here is limited. Yes, I think you should split push. It is generally hard to get on enemy back line and kill them, especially in the current meta. As an assassin, you excel in.... assassinating someone which can be done easily in a 1v1.
5. Both. The generally reasons are usually because those champs have a high skill floor so you have to be exceptionally good on those champs to do well, the meta is in a disadvantage for those champions, or another champ can do what they do better.
6. I have no idea about anything regarding the lore. However his kit does interact with the line. His Q slows enemy if the sword passes through someone. Also, for most people, the line is helpful to keep track of where his sword.",1504224405

Their loyalty is to their friend, not to you. You risk having them develop a very negative perception of you and they will tell your SO that you've been venting/ratting to them which could leave your SO feeling betrayed.

Even venting to your own friends is tricky. If you keep on complaining about your SO to them, they will develop a negative impression of your SO and will grow to dislike him because of what you told them regardless of how happy you are about him otherwise.

Venting to either side increases the possibility that there will be outside pressure to end the relationship. So if you need to talk to someone, make sure it is to seek perspective instead of to just complain and make sure it's with people who are on your side - NOT your partner's.",1504224406

It just came to me, I already knew where I wanted to take it, and how I wanted the characters to be, so I just jumped right in.

8. Your mail will be forwarded to a post office box, not here. if you try to get your mail sent here we will have it returned to sender.
9. One of your daily chores is apartment hunting. You daily search for apartments and provide a list of apartments that you have found and made appointments for. We will help transport you to these appointments.

Women hate the predatory nature of cougar, but weak, passive men latch onto the term and are brainwashed through porn to even consider women in their 40s (because there is no biological, natural desire to pursue such women).

But women don't want to be pursued by average men.  They play musical chairs with a shrinking number of ""eligible"" men instead.

There is just no way to play around it unlike every other tank who has their defenses on timed cooldowns or predetermined health for their shields.

At the end of the day it is my opinion that it leads to incredibly boring gameplay for both sides, but everyone here seems to think blizzard is just caving to some stereotypical 13 year old genji main.

"infertility","t5_2saej","Changing the culture, changing the narrative.. We see that. I mean last eight years and being in NYC I see that. We can't change the past to fit a post modernist perspective. We can try, we are doing it now, but culture changes. The PC culture we had under Clinton in the 90s isn't the same today. Not everything in the past was bad. I mean shit I took three majors in college, one of them being English. I had to take two years of Brit Lit, including a year of Shakespeare. I had to look at Shakespeare from a feminist perspective, from a modernist perspective.. Eventually I'm like can all of you stop telling me how to think and read Shakespeare , can I just read the fucking plays? Lol. But that's a whole theoretical discussion.

What gets my panties twisted though is... America has been ""progressive"" and heading that way for over 20 years now? And people are taught who to be sympathetic to. as a liberal I was taught ok: this group, that group this group. But not as humans. Not as New Yorkers. Like: shit, ok. As a feminist that's down with Steinem, all the pioneers.. We had the same paradigms. It is never assumed, especially for white women feminists, who have run the show before I was born that.. Not everyone wants Bc. Some women want children. Some women want to stay home. Some women are ok in fields that have been dominated by women. But we talk over and for other groups: black women who can't even discuss infertility , birth control. Single mothers. Single women who decide they want to be married to men. You feel me?

The groups that protect everyone, the political part of it..: aren't protecting the spaces of average people. Being progressive and liberal doesn't always equate to being good and nice to all like I thought, and I feel I've been played. This statue offends x y z. Here, hold my sign. You want to do what? Get married and do what? Why be apart of the patriarchy blah x 3. That same brain space we are using to aggressively protect normally marginalized groups take precedence, and we still treat each other like shit. LORT. I'm not talking about hate groups. I'm talking about other women! On a March! To each other! Like I thought we were the good broads! We get so caught up in causes that really, just basic human kindness is out the window. Fat shaming is bad, but the fact I want a kid, shame me because global warming is effected by population control. Or, hello sisters in pussy hats. I donate to every cause you tell me to. Republicans are evil, I feel you. Wait, I'm a bitch now? Because I said don't bring your kid to my booze fest? What? Now I'm Putin?

That is what I don't understand. I thought our progressiveness would be full of unicorn farts.. We are changing the culture, but being a progressive or liberal doesn't mean someone (also who leans progressive and liberal ) won't fuck with you about wanting to have say a kid, or be careful not to trigger you or blah x 3.

In terms of efficiency and output, QM is far inferior. Saw a QM chest completely full of rifles and ammo. Instead, keep the Bmats and send them to the front or a TH chest for people to build defenses. QMs are sending people to do a single job. ""Hey logi driver, I need you to go get SS.""

"reynad","t5_31fjd","Thanks for the write-up! [First thread here](https://www.reddit.com/r/reynad/comments/6r881x/what_we_know_about_reynads_new_card_game/).

&gt; If you haven't heard, Reynad is hard at work on his new card game. Through his stream, many eager viewers have asked him about details to this highly anticipated game but Reynad remains for the most part tight-lipped.
&gt; 
&gt; However, I have gathered a list of facts about the game and will add on here as more info is gathered.
&gt; 
&gt; What we know:
&gt; 
&gt; - Reynad is making a card game.
&gt; - He is currently in the process of writing card ideas on notecards and has designed over 100 cards up to this point
&gt; - He is using sharpie to write on the cards and has already worn out one. However do not fear, he recently bought another fresh one.
&gt; - Reynad has confirmed with us that some cards do stuff while others do not.
&gt; - He states the goal is not to topple Hearthstone but to make loads of money.
&gt; - He says no more details will come until the game is released into beta but more juicy hints still may come
&gt; 
&gt; Note: Interestingly, Reynad is working on another game in addition to the card game that he is very excited for. All that he would say is that it is very complex to make.
&gt; 
&gt; Update: I have some breaking news to share with you folks. Reynad has let spill that the main platform of the game will be mobile. Interestingly, he is toying with the idea of also making paper versions of cards which would indeed be spicy.",1504224420

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","I think Gwent is a different case for a multitude of reasons. First of all, it's based on a popular IP who has great rep in gaming circles, the company making it too.

Secondly, the gameplay is entirely different from Hearthstone and the games you mentioned which always try to offer something similar to MTG, but with a twist. Gwent is something else, which makes it a perfect game for anyone who grew bored of Hearthstone gameplay. I tried other CCGs like Shadowverse and TESL, but the gameplay was too similar to HS. Gwent was a breath of fresh air.


What is more, there's a great deal of communication between devs and the community, you only need to stick around /r/gwent for a bit to see how often the devs post.

The subreddit itself is growing rapidly and is well over 50 000 right now, with lots of lively discussions.


They're taking the esports seriously by introducing a whole new ladder (with a different system) just for those who aim to compete in tournaments, not to mention [their first tournament had the prize pool of $100 000!](http://www.gwentdb.com/news/72-gwent-challenger-100-000-official-tournament)

Still in beta, the game has more features than HS 3 years after release. For how long did players ask for player profiles in HS? They introduced those to Gwent with the latest patch.


Singleplayer component (Thronebreaker expansion) is shaping up to be a lot more lofty and something unseen so far in CCGs. 10-15 hour long, as much dialogue as in the W3 Blood &amp; Wine expansion, branching storylines, etc. Just so much.


All in all, so much work seems to be put it, and the barrier to experience is lower than in HS.


&gt;ese kinds of games promote loyalty and dedication to one game only. Doing daily quests is frankly fucking boring in every single game across the whole genre, so doing more than one set would suck ass. Plus abandoning your whole collection in a game to start over from scratch and be that newbie getting dunked on every game is also very unappealing.

You're underestimating the power of boredom with status quo. Hearthstone is quite barebones (really, they only add new cards) and that can easily turn off people who played for a while now. Not to mention that when they add cards, it often turns into total of shitfests of metas that take months to be patched like Pirates in MSoG or the dominance of Druid now.

It's easy enough to grow your collection in Gwent for it not to be too daunting to leave your HS collection behind and start anew.


&gt;So to be frank, I don't think any game has very much of a chance of beating Hearthstone until they can nail the polish, fun gameplay, interactivity, and maybe even target market of Hearthstone.

I don't think any game will ever ""beat"" Hearthstone in market share, but there certainly can be formidable competition.
Polish, fun gameplay and interactivity are all highly subjective. I'd say Gwent nailed all three, but interactivity is lesser than in HS because there's no minion trading. And that's something down to its design.

The Pokemon Go situation over here is actually pretty nice, much better than people would probably expect, but I've only played in the cities (Cape Town, Pretoria). 

We've got healthy amounts of pokestops and gyms (although as I said I stick to the cities), and I've pretty much seen every wild pokemon in the pokedex minus Unown, so spawns are also pretty rich depending on where you're playing. 

When I stayed in Cape Town, I saw a lot of water pokemon by the coast, and more of a grass biome further inland. Of course there are the usual commons in between. 

In Pretoria, it was dominated mostly by fire, rock and ground type pokemon. I moved between the two cities regularly throughout the year, so it's quite nice to have a change of spawns.

Unfortunately we don't have a continential exclusive, and Corsola just barely edges out the majority of South Africa :(

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","That's the thing; Mercy wasn't FUN with the old revive. Now, with her current revive she is more viable for many reason; and one of those reasons it preventing the push that leads to a requirement of a 5 man rez.

She is not less powerful, and I'm very confident that soon after she hits live people will see the impact she still has on games.

She opens up a huge variety of new strategies. For example;

Imagine this; The enemy just killed off something like, lets say; Zarya. You've effectively lost a valuable tank. Now, your ally widow just sniped the enemy Mercy.

Go in for a revive, and all of a sudden that 5v5 turns into a 6v5 in your favor, and you still have your ultimate. Plays like this commonly happen on the PTR for me. It's not a rare thing.

Imagine this too;

Enemy just picks off two of you, and your reaper gets a nice ult and kills 3;

New mercy goes in, Revives, ults, revives, and keeps everyone healed and/or dmg boosted to kill the remaining 3 on the enemy side.

This commonly happens too.

Mercy's revive is more skill based, and is far more consistent to make plays.

There is no longer that 1-2, sometimes 3 ""big plays"" that Mercy makes. Now it's a very consistent feeling throughout the entire game.

&gt; How does she not heal only a little more?

As I've mentioned, I've been playing her on the PTR for an extended amount of time every day. I've seen much much higher healing numbers, and consistently higher numbers as well.

I've seen consistent 40-45% healing, and have seen a few cards at 50-60%. Any lower healing amount (like between 3-8k healing done) is usually the 50-60%, but sometimes I won't get a card for healing done because I've done so many revives as well.

He hasn't broken a single law, he's just chosen to accept negative media attention that will be ongoing if he's signed by another team, which few will want to deal with, and that's his cross to bear.

"LabourUK","t5_30c1v","It's quite clear that the wider UK population isn't ready for a nuanced debate on immigration - certainly a large portion of either side of the Brexit debate.

As is mentioned in the piece, Corbyn tried to talk about the unscrupulous hiring practices (of importing cheap, EU labour) which were undermining the earning potential of the working classes in certain industries - and was almost derided for being anti-immigrant (which is presumably worse than anti-immigration).

I've yet to see anyone truly approach the topic with a nuanced position, it seems that this is a topic that encourages absolutism.

The media certainly had a role to play in the outcome of the referendum, but that is one of the 'costs' of a free press.

What do I think Labour can do?

Publicly have the debate, but in a non-confrontational, good faith way. There needs to be room in the Labour Party for a variety of opinion, and I think that that Party needs to ensure that debates that are held across the country are held within the Party - only through this can 'we' all work out the best way to approach and resolve the issues surrounding immigration, especially for some of the people that see Labour as responsible for making mistakes over immigration.

That said, I mostly see those people who *strongly* point the finger at Labour for being at fault as just looking for a convenient stick with which to attack our last Government - perhaps I do so wrongly. No government since has actually done anything to bring down immigration (aside from wrecking our international reputation and impairing our economy), so I don't really understand why what happened 20 years ago is more important to some of these people, than what has been going on for the last 7 (lots of rhetoric, lots of promises, no action).",1504224427

For a complex combination of reasons, the USA is literally the best place on the planet for money laundering. Shell companies are legal, you can spin up a corporation in 20 minutes, lots of nice laws that protect corporate assets, lots of rich people who want to hide their money, and lots of complex tax laws. Plus 200 years of the rule of law, so the government cant just take your money without a good reason, which few other tax havens can claim.

So, out of pure greed, Russian oligarchs decided to move roughly 1.4 *trillion* dollars of wealth out of Russia and into the West. A lot of which made it to America.

After this investigation, not only will Mueller nail Trump... but he'll nail *the entire fucking Russian money laundering network.* And then boom! A good chunk of that 1.4 trillion is assets will be siezed. The life savings of every crook in Russia will now be US property. And they will all blame Putin for this. If he hadn't meddled in the election, this literally never would have happened.

Naturally the Russian people will want that money brought back to them. But the USA gets to decide how that money goes back... and what conditions need to be met first.

**EDIT:** for people who would like a source for the 1.4 Trillion dollar number, it came from Bill Browders testimony to congress. After this, like 95% of congress voted to pass an even stricter version of the Magnitsky Act that locks down Putin's stolen money. Outside the ability for Trump to veto. Its a long frigging read but it gives you all the info you need to know about Putin:

I just want to make one point though: the old crystals were doomed from the start. They never could have been saved, they were always going to break. The protagonists' failure to defend them is meant to illustrate the endeavor's futility, not their own ineptitude.

It's through the crystals' own destruction that they enact the world's salvation, by imparting the spirits of heroes that rest within them unto the crystal bearers. By harnessing these spirits and incubating them within themselves as they master the jobs, along with the core emotions each crystal represents, the Warriors of the Crystal are essentially growing new crystals within themselves and giving life to the world once again, to be reborn from them after they use their power to defeat the evil threatening it. It's all ordained by destiny.

That's one of the other things I really love about the game, when you replay it with the knowledge given to you at the end when they're all floating in the [Silent Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=373UCYPsDTs) you can see how deliberate everything is right from the start. There's so much symbolism and purpose behind all the actions and even the music that weaves scenes together.

They didn't pay $6 million for either. The situations are not comparable. And you're strawmanning the hell out of my argument. I never said Okada *couldn't* be a star, but WWE's not breaking the bank and taking a major gamble on something that could fall flat so fast. $6 million with a reduced schedule for a newcomer? No.

&gt;Again, if you don't know the man personally, how can you even make an assumption like this and act like it's a FACT?

They could change, but with history, what's been said, and the current situations it's not worth taking into consideration when the WWE question is and always has been a very hard ""No."" Remove money from the equation, and the loyalty aspect which is also very big in puro comes in and removes most-any doubt of him leaving.

&gt;You're obviously underestimating his reach if you think he has 'little' recognition. He's no Stone Cold or CM Punk, but Okada has a huge reputation among wrestling fans.

I didn't say he has no recognition, I said he has little recognition with *mainsteam and casual fans* He also needs to translate well for that segment of the crowd and fast to justify $6 million a year on a reduced schedule, or whatever offer they would throw which would shatter the bank to outbid Bushiroad. Brock translates well. Cena does too. Stone Cold did. CM Punk did. $6 or so million for a newcomer who's not worked here a lot is a steep price and a big gamble.

&gt;Never hinted anything OTHER than the WWE being the richest company. Your insecurity knows no bounds.

You're complaining about downvotes and playing the victim card with NJPW ""stooges"" poking holes and pointing out what's wrong with what you're saying. Think twice before you accuse someone else of being insecure.

I like $15 Sony water resistant headphones. I can lose em, wash em, carry em in my pocket and replace them at will. Went on Amazon a couple weeks ago and saw basically no options with USB-C. 

Wireless sucks. I don't want another thing to have to remember to charge. 

That right there pretty much ruled out the Pixel 2. I tried to iPhone 7 last year for a month and the dongle worked, but was obnoxious. There's literally no reason for this and no benefit to making this switch.

Higher quality audio? That's what my home stereo is for. My phone is for on the go. I don't need a DAC or high fidelity audio on the bus or at the gym.",1504224430
"GlobalOffensiveTrade","t5_2y6r4","We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you love who you are then just go keep that mindset before the trip! You're gonna at least have some new perspective on things after.

Because Australia is to Europe like Canada is to America. Ever inferior to the older brother, always trying to distance themselves through faux smugness, yet always comes crawling back when given the slightest bit of attention.

&gt;And that's all you've got to show for it. Donnie tearing down Obama's accomplishments because he's a consummate fuck up, and deep down he knows it, and you know it too. Literally no accomplishments, and his own party banging on the table, waiting to eat his fat ass alive once enough of you mean-spirited shitheads realize

That's quite the screed about people daring to disagree with your political ideology, but I'm not sure how that's relevant in any way, except to further underline your fragility.

&gt;If I 'cut and ran' then why did I miss both of Obama's terms? Wouldn't I have run back to America in my skinny jeans and fauxhawk when he won?

You literally said you left because of republicans daring to exist. I imagine them simply being allowed to own property and remain free citizens was enough to make you reeeee about the evils of America to your wannabe socialist countrymen. It makes about as much sense as you leaving in the first place, lol.

Besides that, you of all people should know outside of America Obama was just another right wing politician. Even under him, life would be too hard compared to your current mollycoddled existence.

He didn't say or even imply that all or even the majority of Mexicans, worldwide, are rapists, have drug problems, and are murderers. He was talking about the immigrants coming over to the US and then he expanded it to say Latin/South America and the Middle East.

So if we really want to be pedantic about it he's actually saying all of the **immigrants** coming over from Latin and South America as well as the Middle East are problematic, bringing in drugs, are rapists and murderers.

Jesus Christ, I can't believe it even has to be said but obviously it's not a true statement and he was obviously pandering to the xenophobes in his audience but that is all irrelevant because saying immigrants are bad is not the same as saying people of a nationality are bad when he's saying that only the bad ones are coming over.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Do you think antifa is an actual organisation with an actual agenda? It's a bunch of angry people who likely met online.

Antifa actually is a large, global group with roots all the way back in 1930's Germany. Traditionally, sects always form from some pro-communism group. Similar to the KKK being formed from white separatist groups. They were active in Britain in the 90's, Germany from the 80's forward, Sweden in the mid-2000's and USA just lately. They may not be as organized, but there is consistent motive and similar goals. 

&gt;So you actually want a peaceful solution? You don't want Democrats do be disenfranchised or attacked?

Does any rational American want his fellow countrymen attacked? I just want to be able to share my opinions without losing my job, being blacklisted from certain industries, or being decried as a racist. See, the problem with labeling everyone on the right a Nazi or a racist or a white supremacist, is that it removes the responsibility one has to actually try to understand that persons reasoning. And then we down the rabbit hole to violence. And eventually counter violence. And now no one knows why we're actually fighting. I'm just punching commies, and you're punching nazis and we forget that deep down, we actually want similar things for ourselves and the citizens of this country. We want better jobs, more disposable income, less poverty, less drug addiction, better education, better infrastructure and a life free of hassle from the government. We just can't agree on how to get there. But sticking our heads in the sand and pretending we can't hear each other does nothing but lead to extremism and narrow-mindedness which can only devolve into political violence, civil war, and destruction.",1504224436

Anyway, I click on it because I was simply interested and I find out a student who attend the high school I'm currently in died. I continue researching because I was extremely interested. I find out that he played soccer for the school team and wore number 21. I wear number 21 for the school soccer team. After that, I find out that he attend my parish. And finally, I find out he had a brother named Sebastian. Then, it hits me. I've met Bartosz and Sebastian before. It was 3 or 4 years ago when I was still in middle school. One day, my friend, Jack and I, went to go play hockey on a pond. That's where we met Bartosz and Sebastian. Sebastian came up to us and introduced himself. When I told him my name was Bartosz, he said that that was funny because that was also his brother's name and it's not a very popular name. In conclusion, I learned about someone who had my first name (a very uncommon name), went to my school, wore the same number as I do on the soccer team, and went to my church. On top of all of this, I met the guy several years before. It may not seem very creepy but it all hit me at once and I had one of does ""oh shit"" moments.",1504224436

Probably, the best way to learn is to be taught by someone that knows how to play. You can call up your Local Gaming Store (LGS) and see if you can schedule a game demonstration. They may be able to give you some free cards and/or recommend some product that would be good for a beginner. 

Else, if you want to learn on your own, you can download Duels on PC (Steam), iOS or xbOne, and play through all its Tutorials, and Gideon's Origins campaign. That should get you up to speed to on playing. Keep in mind, support this game have been cut.

&gt; Do I draw after every turn?

There are 5 Phases in a Turn. Some Phases are divided into Steps.

Drawing a card per turn is a Turn-Based Action that happens in the Draw step, which is the last Step in the Beginning Phase. Keep in mind, this step is skipped for the player that plays the first turn.

The Turn structure is;

* Beginning Phase - Untap, Upkeep and Draw steps

* (Precombat) Main Phase

* Combat Phase - Beginning of Combat, Declare Attackers, Declare Blockers, Combat Damage and End of Combat Steps

* (Postcombat) Main Phase

* End Phase - End and Cleanup steps.",1504224437

Though that is one of only a very few downsides to PC gaming and there are always a decent player who points you in the right direction of even writes a tutorial to help you set it up.

Win some lose some I guess, but I really hope Bungie know better than to listen to toxic players and instead speak to real PC gamers who are very technical as they have all said it's not an issue and the only issue is that it'll lead to a blame culture even the person who wrote the first blog post said it's not an issue at all there is no advantage to having XIM or using a controller a KB/M player still plays better every time and he tested all 3 ways as he is a XIM user himself on console probably created this for clicks/likes or whatever then it turned into this nightmare so he had to post all his results which bare out that XIM makes KB/M worse even with AA it plays bad.

Racial stereotypes have existed for a very long time and it's the way most racism is expressed, especially in recent times as it hasn't been as acceptable to be overtly racist but the roots remain. With enough time racial bias becomes true overt racism which is what we're seeing more of these days. People aren't born with swastikas tattooed on their foreheads. So yes, there's a minority that calls black queens the n-word, but casual racism? there's a shitload of that, it hasn't magically gone away. Do I think people have reasons to dislike Tyra, Kennedy, whoever? Yes, but I also think there's a component of racial profiling that makes it worse, and it's really important to talk about it and not dismiss it. It's not a coincidence that white queens aren't seen as problematic for xxx excuse, but black queen behavior is blown out of proportion real fast and never forgotten.

As a black person, it is my unfortunate duty to confirm that (assuming that reporting and arrest patterns are equal, which they aren't), american black people *do* commit a higher percentage of crimes by population than white people, due in no small part to the abundance of poverty in black communities, which is in turn attributable to systemic inequality and the idiocy of the way that america's economics work (***cough***capitalism***cough***).

It isn't inaccurate to state that a group has a problem due in no small part to outside forces, it is, however, inaccurate to assume that black people are inherently more violent or that they just don't want to act like civilized ~~white~~ people.

Are you really expecting me to #notall this?

Sure there are women who are more educated than most men will ever be, and sure there are ~~an abundance of~~ men who are dumber than the average loaf of bread, but that doesn't mean that there isn't a general trend of men being encouraged to and actually going through their education while women are told that they shouldn't have an education or that they should value having a family more or whatever else.

I don't know what to tell you here. You are responding as though we live in an ideal world where girls grow up with the same encouragement to get educated as men, and where women get to go to college and have careers without pressure to drop out and have babies.

We don't live in that world right now, and the result is that we are going to see a disparity between the education, the work experience, the preferred types of fields, and the everything else because we live in a sexist world that tells women ""You can't/shouldn' get an education, and if you do, be a teacher not a doctor"" and tells men ""The sky's the limit, be whatever you want"".

Getting mad at the people who point out that women are more likely to get cheated out of an education than men doesn't do anything to fix that, it just denies the problem and puts blame on the people pointing out that an issue exists while ignoring the issue itself.

You can't just pretend that women don't get less education than men just like you can't just pretend that black people on't commit crimes. You have to point out the issue and you have address the things which cause the problem and you have to address the system which led to the cause and so on. 

What does *not* help is getting mad when someone points out that they, being male, had a much greater opportunity to get an education than they might have if they were female.",1504224439

As I said before I've only ever disliked ONE show (angel beats). I might have dropped K project but that was something we watched together very quickly long ago. 

I think the problem with ""no-drop"" people is that most of us are on this big kick and really enjoy the medium. I am on a huge anime kick ever since last September, but when I start hitting 200-300 shows I may end my ""no drop"" status when I start getting bored like you seem to be. ",1504224440

The difference between the two is that the former is trigger locked and a ""difficult to break into"" container or room.

Those latter items are not the same as a ""cabinet, container or room difficult to break into"".

Its a subtle difference but it really differentiates between a purpose-made gun-room vs a pre-existing structure; or a purpose made gun safe vs a repurposed container like a general locker that hasn't undergone any modification etc.

But really for a restricted; 

&gt; As long as there's a trigger lock on it and your ammo is somewhere else you don't need either

is still outright wrong. Even if there was a trigger lock on it, it would still need to be in a cabinet, container or room that is difficult to break into.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","If you're looking to potentially play through Destiny 1 *just* so you can experience the story (and only the story), in my opinion it's not really worth it. The vanilla story is infamously regarded as extremely weak, and while later expansions have improved on that, the overall story isn't entirely clear *still* thanks to Grimoire Cards--collectible ""cards"" that were *not* viewable in-game, but would reveal tons of information about the lore of the game ([example Grimoire Card talking about the Vault of Glass](http://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/vault-of-glass), a raid location in Destiny). Much of the story in Destiny is still unclear even after completing the entirety of the single-player storyline unless you read these Grimoire Cards.

If you care about the story and want to know more about it, a YouTuber by the name of My Name is Byf recently released a [1 hour 30 minute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2avSq-82oI) video detailing the entire story of Destiny 1 and does a better job explaining it than the game does. If you'd like to learn about the lore the way most of us did, you can even head to the [Ishtar Collective](http://www.ishtar-collective.net/) which contains all of Destiny's Grimoire Cards in an easily accessible format. The website even includes a [timeline](http://www.ishtar-collective.net/timeline) if you need to get your bearings.

As for whether or not Rise of Iron is important to the overall story, it's a little difficult to say personally. You do meet some characters which were previously enigmatic, but the main villain kind of comes out of left field and leaves just as quickly. There *may* be reference to what happens in Rise of Iron come Destiny 2, but the conflict that occurs in it is very localized, compared to the events of The Dark Below and The Taken King.

When majkowski7 does his drawings, we don't remove them, when guys made bar tops, or tables with bottle caps, we didn't remove it. The corn hole games people made were never removed.

What we are talking about is strictly people trying to *sell* things on our sub. Small t-shirt companies who think they can get free advertising, various users trying to use the sub promote their Etsy store or use it as their own focused eBay type of thing.

All of this has happened, and we'd like it not to. We're not a billboard.

Your KD Ratio is likely to take a hit, but you CAN be very effective on certain objectives/maps. You might not get the kill but if you can reduce someone to a fraction of their original health, your team members stand a much better chance in a 1v1 fight near the objective

Pack shield or cooling cell, bacta, jet pack and bodyguard. Why those? Longevity my friend. You wanna get somewhere high and inaccessible, and you're going to want every means possible of staying alive and taking advantage of other the enemy's power drop off over distance. 

Shield/bacta and bodyguard all help with keeping you alive, and the faster you rack up kills the faster your trait levels, meaning you get more and more resistant to blasters. Cooling cell can then be a substitute if you find you need a few shots to kill. 

Personally I've really given the DLT-19x a go, but I've stopped using it. I find you just can't contribute enough, and if you die you've then got to schlep back to a good spot, and in the meantime you're more than likely to get killed by someone who can outgun you.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I *Mostly* agree with what you are saying. I just think I disagree on the causes. I don't think it's that we aren't paying living wages that is an issue. I think the issue is that we have a bunch of uneducated older folks who have no way to get themselves out of the rut they are in. Yeah, higher wages would help them get out of their bad situation and maybe get educated. *BUT*, on the contrary, then there would be less jobs available for people looking to enter the workforce. I think minimum wage is good at where it's at. Plenty for young kids and young adults. But, they need to figure out something else to get these older folks stuck working minimum wage jobs who expect to be paid as if they had a demanding and skill required job. Wether that is a different minimum wage for people over X years old (which would get sticky because then who would want to hire them, you'd probably have to get part of it funded by the government), or you'd have to get some programs in place to create more higher paying jobs and/or train them to have more skills. It's not clear cut like most people think, it's not just like you can pay everyone more and all of a sudden every issue is fixed. But it's also not right to just claim no one should be paid more. I'm not sure exactly how you would fix it though. Any thoughts? Oh, and I'm a big fan of capitalism, so that's where we split in our thinking too.",1504224444

If it's the latter, they have no obligation to alter the lease. Sounds like she is saying you can have other people move in, and she will add them to the lease. But the people who moved out are still liable if the new people don't pay. And she'd be perfectly fine stating that. Maybe not your best case scenario but it's a good idea for her to do that. Legally, there isn't anything you can do about that. If you can find other roommates go ahead and add them to the lease because that may prevent them from flaking on you.

"rupaulsdragrace","t5_2t3or","My argument is less that the show itself is racist and more that the racist fans of the show have an impact on it?

&gt;' I'm sorry about it, but what you said about fans being 'harsher on black queens' with their judgments is totally wrong. Latrice royale was majorly loved in both seasons she was in, she was black.

'I'm not racist - I love Latrice' is literally a subreddit meme. Tyra even acknolwegdes it in her Hey Qween interview, recommend watching it. And yes, fans do judge black queens more harshly. Tyra was 'robbed' by Raven despite having a far better track record. Kennedy 'robbed' Katya when her record was more consistent and she outperformed her in the lipsync. Kennedy was the subject of such vitriol by the community that producers pushed Pearl to top 3 over her despite her better record. Nina Bonina Brown was the subject on intense racial abuse by Valentina's fans for eliminating her. Jasmine got targeted with a huge amount of racialised abuse. Bob is cocky, arrogant, and has a big mouth - of the top 4, the one non-black queen should have won according to most fans.

&gt;I'm sorry but no race gets harder judged by anyone, yes you do get the fans that are very racist 

You're aware that you're contradicting yourself, right? You are aware of this? I'm talking about much of the drag race fanbase being racist. You're agreeing that they are, but also argue that they aren't because Latrice is popular. I do not understand what you're trying to say. It's not even like you can pretend it's a tiny minority - the majority of fans on social media are shitty to Tyra. The majority were shitty to Kennedy. The majority were shitty to Jasmine.

Black queens get judged harsher than white queens, overall. Not necessarily on reddit, but the fanbase isn't just reddit.

&gt;Rupauls drag race brings family together, creates peace and iconic scenes, speeches and evolves incredible queens we love to see. If we can't love the show for what it is and what it does already, without having to constantly claim it's this, it's that, it's racist, etc then you're not getting the clear message.

Acknowledging the incredibly racist elements of the drag race fandom doesn't contradict the message of love. Ignoring racism and trying to gaslight it by saying 'but people love latrice' ignores the message of love.

&gt;but your fueling the idiotic, messy fans that are racist to the likes of Trya. 

Me calling out racist fans as being shit empowers racist fans?",1504224445

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","There are maybe a couple of premium planes that work in squadron battles, and that's only if the standards are set pretty low. Most squadrons want you flying planes from the regular tree (Griffon Spitfires and Bearcats).

The Spitfire F XIVc is okay but not ideal as a fighter and has very little ground-attacking capability, so that's one possibility.

The Wyvern will ground-attack decently but is dogshit as a fighter, though you can occasionally trade in a head-on, so it might be accepted.

The P-47M is a similar deal to the Wyvern. It has the ground-attack capability but will get wrecked by other aircraft.

It depends on who you join whether you'll be allowed to use any of these vehicles, and most even semi-decent squadron battle squadrons will ask you to grind out a Griffon Spit or a Bearcat instead, so you should really consider doing that rather than just getting a premium plane to use in squadron battles.",1504224447

&gt; Nick and Alyssa came back to Seattle and at 15 weeks pregnant started the long journey of systemic chemotherapy treatments. The treatments were hard and not expected to cure him, making them all the more difficult. The hope was to get him to another surgery. It was the only chance to possibly eradicate all of the cells.

This was after a period in which the cancer had gone into remission following aggressive treatment.  I assume you missed that.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I'm completely with you on that D3 doesn't suck. However I think people tend to oversimplify this problem.

When they are talking about being good what do they mean? Good at soloQ? Good at competitive 5v5 team sense? etc. People often say ""Good at the game"" but that doesn't really solve anything since there is so many modes to consider.

Then people talk about rank. You say you are D3. In what sense? In team that I work with on our scouting report we have I think 6-7 questions regarding ranks. Peak rank total? Rank range of this season? Current rank? Between season rank difference? etc. In sports academy I work with we have even more and just to be clear I personally consider rank to be quite poor estimate alone of players abilities.

However when you are describing Challenger and D3 with that kind of difference at least in competitive sense that makes me flinch a little bit. I can easily think of one player who frequents in D3 (D1-D3 range) currently in D2 that I would happily put in competitive against mid-high master mid laners. Also I can think of two master players in recent teams that I've worked with who I assume to struggle when facing D2 players or better in competitive. Also to throw one more there is actually challenger peak rank player who was kicked out of mid diamond team and can't find above low dia team if he tried.

Why I bring this up is people often use competitive aspect ""being pro"" as part of this comparison. For those who are interested in that part getting to d4 is like the first requirement. Then in my personal opinion rank stops mattering and then you start climbing up in competitive(somewhat invisible) ladder.

The catch is that for example with that D1-D3 ranging mid laner he hasn't improved in soloQ rank's for a long time, like several years. But during last year or so he has improved insanely as competitive player. So let's say we give him ""Competitive Rank"" of D4 4 years ago when he was D1. During those 3 years he's ""CR"" went from D4-D3 maybe with him staying in similar soloQ ranks or even doing worse. However he's still D2 in soloQ, but I'd say he's ""CR"" has gone to like M(low)-M(mid). ",1504224450

Time changes everything and one day you'll be happy with a partner and you'll be glad you didn't do this. whenever im having a bad day i always tell myself there's always a tomorrow for things to get better and who knows everything could starting going your way!

Gotta get pure, and smoking is a distraction from that at it's core for me. As for belief systems, welcome, I have a lot of confusion about that too after several years of aya use.

It's actually extremely common for a person not to fight back in assault because of fear, so a rape kit does look for these things but it is not essential to an arrest being made.
The fact of the matter is this woman's case should have gone to court. They should have been able to cross examine the accused and deduced that he was lying, not her. Justice is a human right.

We should not reward those parents' intentional lawbreaking with citizenship.  It would be wrong and unjust to reward breaking our immigration laws with citizenship.

DACA recipients were children when they entered the country illegally, which is why I would not hold accountable for their violation of our laws as children.  On the other hand, their parents were adults when they broke our laws; therefore, the parents must be held accountable.  

I would not mind granting a path to citizenship to DACA recipients - *but it would have to be under one condition:* should we give a path to citizenship to DACA recipients, then they must not be able to sponsor their lawbreaking parents to become legal resident or citizen down the road.  That must be non-negotiable.  I  would not allow illegal aliens (i.e., the parents who purposefully broke our laws and brought their children here) to abuse chain migration.

I see only one solution: do not allow citizens to sponsor *any* family member or relative into the US.  We should restrict family sponsorship for immigration visa to only two categories: (a) married spouses and (2) underage children.  So adult or elderly parents should be excluded from family sponsorship.   That should apply to DACA recipients and *all* future immigrants: put an end to chain migration.  Once we have eliminated the loopholes for DACA recipients to sponsor their parents to become legal resident/citizenship down the road, then I am open to discussion of granting a path for citizenship for DACA  recipients.",1504224456

Of course in this situation the police would talk to the surviving father or if reversed, the mother, but we all know that only a father would be suspected and negatively implicated. A surviving mother could show the cops home movies of herself violently abusing her dead ex and she'd still be the victim. 

This blame gap, tied as it is to the empathy gap is one of the most casual and commonplace forms of sexism against men our society practices. Even pointing it out to people when they do it—as maybe you and definitely others in this thread are right now—arouses deep suspicions that something must be wrong with you. I understand MRAlawyers hostility toward the sort of low level man-blaming you're practicing right now. This sub is one of the few places where you'll be called out for it.

Then Virtus (current number 3), appeared and beat my 39 seconds with his own faster 39 seconds run. So we then went back and forth until he peaked at 38 seconds and me at 36 seconds. Once again I was ready to call it quit since I thought 36 seconds was pretty good and I felt quite confident that I would be able to make top three.

That's when IO TsCTalc beat my score by a mere 3 point. I obviously got really upset and it push me to try even harder. I kept pushing and pushing until I manage to achieve this score. If he had waited on the last day to snipe me, I don't think I would have been able to make this run.

Wether I get sniped at the end by an even bigger whale or either of these players, I am very happy with this time and I don't think I can come up with a better strategy on my own. I honestly did not think it was even possible to do sub 35 seconds with my team but I guess I proved myself wrong.

R4 Enlightenment x Shadow Eliminator

R4 Dazzling Blink

Googling the pastors name the other day I found that she is involved in this church:

Googling around for creative agencies in that area I found this:

Who's owner is linked on the pages LinkedIn:

https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-mcivor-9a0b9880/


His partner is:

https://twitter.com/clare_mcivor

Who you can establish the link through her instagram which has photos of the both of them:

https://www.instagram.com/claremcivor/


She also has this photo:

https://www.instagram.com/p/BAJyB66gjNL/?taken-by=claremcivor

Which clearly shows the CityBuilders church in the background. As this wasn't a particularly difficult ad to put together, I strongly believe that it was therefore http://www.heartlandcreative.com.au/ however there is not 100% proof, just the relationship linking the agency to her (also they are all 'McIvor' so all the same churchy family').


EDIT: Idk why I did all that work, looking at the agency website there is this photo:

Since when does content have anything to do with difficulty?

&gt;The 2 things you've said is that lockpicking 'needs a tutorial' (which it REALLY doesn't, it's VERY VERY simple but sure they could've thrown something in)

And exactly where on that lockpick screen does it indicate that the hole in the circle must align with the top of the key? I found that out as well after a few tries, but is a mention on how it works too much to ask? And I don't understand why you're now saying it doesn't need a tutorial when you yourself agreed that a tutorial should've been done.

&gt;Please, if you actually want to prove your point I'm all ears, because all you've been doing is slinging shit around.

I literally posted a screenshot of a dozen enemies swarming my team at once. Surely even we can both agree that's a little much, and as for slinging shit around, you aren't exactly much better. 

&gt;I downvoted you once and you instantly started whining about it and every single time you get downvoted by other people you cry about it and instantly jump trying to say it's me.


If you downvote someone and admit it was you, you can't complain if they suspect downvotes are from you. There's a reason why subreddits add a notice that the downvote button isn't an I disagree button. 

But yeah, my comments are getting more bitchy because we've dragged this back and forth longer than we should. I admitted (and I'll admit i t again) that my initial rant was too bias and I should type a more fair comment, but downvoting me over it and saying I deserve it because ""bitching"" doesn't exactly convince me to be mature with you. You clearly view me inferior and I'm not nice enough to forgive that. At the end of the day you view a game should be given more of a chance because it's beta, and I don't think it deserves much when it's due for release in a few weeks. Either way I'm annoyed over this topic, and you're probably too so there's not much of a need to further this ""discussion""",1504224458

NUNCA COMPRES CARNE. El puré día es una garompa. Tapas para empanadas de empaque violeta van re bien. Quesito tipo addler pero rectangular, va bien. NUNCA COMPRES CARNE. Lácteos tipo yogures y quesos untables no, mejor compra ilolay. El cheddar de día es riquísimo, pero mucho más caro que el cheddar de fiambreria. NUNCA COMPRES CARNE. Las patitas de pollo con jamón y queso absorben demasiado aceite. Las papas congeladas y milangas de soja están buenas. Sobre todo las milangas rellenas. NUNCA COMPRES CARNE. La bebida similar a la terma está buena. Los jugos en sobre también. Las salsas en lata están potables, los fideos secos no. Las galletitas a veces vienen quemadas. Pan para panchos / hamburguesas no están buenos. NUNCA COMPRES CARNE. 

Después, te recomiendo llevar la tarjeta día. Mediante lo que se llama fidelizacion, día junta tus datos de compra y mensualmente salen cupones de descuento en base a esas compras que hiciste, y alguno que otro cupón con descuentos en cosas que a ellos les sobra. Por ejemplo, esposo consume una cantidad exagerada de arroz con leche y dulce de leche tregar y todos los meses nos salen cupones de eso. Fijate que antes los cupones salían nada más en el local donde se usó la tarjeta la primera vez, ahora supuestamente salen en cualquier super, pero no me consta. Controla que las salchichas, sean de la marca que sean, no hayan perdido cadena de frío. Si el empaque está pegado  a las salchichas, todo OK. Si hay muchas burbujas de aire, perdió la cadena.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Google is not a monopoly, but maybe there would be a better word to describe ""top competitor who has more pull than others to the point of there being less compeititon""

I don't know how to describe this, generally I am suspicious of the big corporations because they always pull these kinds of things due to ""market"" or whatever pressure: basically, this problem was known about a while ago. Google has had bad privacy policies that explicitly say they track you, at which point some liberty-minded people dropped out of all contact with google services. Others poked fun at people for being too ""principled"" or ""extreme"" or ""not prudent enough"" or whatever, I mean you can still keep using google services if you judge it is a good deal, or try to use google stuff while you build up alternatives. But it was obvious a while ago that these bad policies existed, and at this point in the game people are simply kind of complaining because they ignored the warning signs, in my view. These corporations throughout their lifecycle often start off with something idealistic (""free speech"" platform), then when they get too big people complain a lot so they start ""privately censoring"" things or enacting other bad policies. It is at that point that liberty-minded people should jump ship (unless they agree with the policy of course) and support an alternative, which gives the company an incentive to change their policy back and/or the market need is filled by the competitor.

Basically the view that ""Google is a monopoly"" is kind of an expression of the lack of desire to do the work to build an alternative, and lose some of the money of being able to be on a bigger platform and reach more people, than switch to an alternative which might have more freedom but reach less people/make less money. But it's also their free speech to complain about Google and try to negotiate better consumer terms and things",1504224462

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Maybe it's because I'm not from Sri Lanka (I'm traveling around North America), but I've had a different experience than you. The question of apostasy gets brought up occasionally (it's a mixed bag regarding how people react to atheists in their presence), and pretty much everyone I meet and are friends with (including Muslim men and women) give a variation of the same answer: you don't abandon your family, you love your family. I have no reason to disbelieve any of them, because I've worked and studied with them and they seem on the ball, so clearly you and I have a difference of experience.  

The more progressive a culture is (relatively speaking), the more likely the people in it shape their religion to fit the culture rather than the other way around. Having a job, having food and water, having social stability, having a good family structure, access to good education, and not being shot at all the time make people chill the fuck out and just want to enjoy life. The reduction of danger, stress, and alienation go a long way to getting people to do the things they really want, like raise a family or studying to do great things or being productive members of society or even just playing video games.

If you could combine two archetypes that had almost nothing in common (for instance a Sharpshooting Athletic Finisher), it wouldn't make sense for that player to be a hall-of-fame caliber dunker AND be able to green light from 30 feet. Therefore they shouldn't be able to have both HoF posterizer and HoF limitless.

If someone has an all-around game, they can contribute in more areas but won't dominate in any one specific role. However, if you combine two archetypes that are much closer in playstyle, for instance a Shot Creating Playmaker (for a guard) or an Athletic Post Scorer (for a big), they have attributes that complement each other. It would make sense for each of those builds to have HoF tier abilities and badges at their respective positions.

2K is trying to avoid the demigod dilemma, where you had 7'0 point guards with handles who could pull from three or dunk over an entire team.

Edit -

To expand on this, some more archetype combos that shouldn't have HoF badges:

* Playmaking Glass Cleaner

* Lockdown Shot Creator

vs archetypes that could reasonably have a couple HoF tier skills and badges (just the first ones that come to mind):

* Playmaking Slasher (One Man Fastbreak)

* Sharpshooting Shot Creator (Mid Range Deadeye)

* Shot Creating Point Forward (Ankle Breaker)

* Post Scoring Glass Cleaner (Brick Wall, Bruiser)

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","This sounds like something I would've written a couple of months/weeks ago. It's very strange to read it from the position I'm in now because I feel so far removed from these feelings. Today marks exactly three months since my breakup, and it's taken me the whole summer to get to this point of peace. You will also get to a point where the crying stops, the anger ceases and you'll realise that you don't even miss him anymore. Of course, the memories will remain, and perhaps you'll even miss the idea of him but these intense emotions will fade away. 

It's very painful, I know but sometimes you can only find solace in knowing that the love you received is not the love you deserve, but it allows you to be hopeful. It's exhausting to feel so strongly for someone who can't reciprocate those same feelings but you are capable of being loved completely. Yes, it sucks that it couldn't be him but your story doesn't end with him and that's okay. 

You want to talk to him because even though he's the one who hurt you, it feels like he's the only person that can make you feel better but that's not true. Forgive him even if he hasn't apologised because that will help you move forward. Heartbreak definitely builds character, and we can learn a lot from failed relationships. If you need to cry, then cry. If you need to write about your feelings, then do so. It's a healing process and you will get there. ",1504224464

Meeks improved his personality so much that he later cheated on his wife with a rich bimbo and didn't even feel bad about it.

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","I'm afraid that Cerave in the tub is breaking me out :( My skincare journey started with this sub and Cereve when I discovered that my moisture barrier was wrecked from years of attacking my skin with scrubs and not moisturizing. At the time, I would probably get 2-3 zits per week. At first I noticed my skin get 10 times worse. I thought it was because I wasn't exfoliating anymore and was willing to wait it out. 

Fast forward 1 month and I'm feeling pretty good about my moisture barrier but the acne was v bad. So then the lightbulb goes on and I realized that my acne got worse when I started the Cereve moisturizer. I quit using Cereve and reintroduce Mac's Complete Comfort Creme -- which is what I occasionally used to use before and know doesn't break me out. BEST SKIN IN MONTHS. 

Unfortunately, the Mac isn't very hydrating so I decided to give the Cereve another try three days ago. This time I sort of ""patch test"" by using the Cereve on half of my face and Mac on half my face (only at night). Yesterday and today my chin/jaw became a bumpy irritated mess...but here's the confusing part: I'm broken out on both sides. Am I overthinking this? My theory is that it transferred to my pillow and got all over my face. Has anyone had this happen to them? All advice is appreciated!",1504224465

"quityourbullshit","t5_2y8xf","You know what's funny? Pretty much the exact opposite of what you said has either happened to me, or people around me. I've dealt with nice cops yes, but most of them have been unpleasant while I am polite, and for that matter, sober (I don't drink). Yes they are humans just like the rest of us, but either around me, or people I know, they always behave like they're so much better than you, with this air or superiority. I hope you know what I mean.

They have been dicks just for the hell of it and at times, when you need them most, they are the most disruptive voices. I don't dislike cops just because, I dislike cops because pretty much every interaction (save (safe?) for a small few) I, or family and friends, have had with them has been unpleasant. 

Keep in mind I'm not just talking about white cops. One of my worst experiences and the one that always comes to mind when I think about how much I dislike cops, was with an Asian male. Taking it even further, I have met some very nice white cops. They're out there somewhere. 

Let me put it to you like this, if you work in an office, and there's a guy that everytime you speak to him he's always an asshole, always disrespecting you, are you gonna say he's a great guy and maybe you just caught him at bad time everytime? Or would you consider him an asshole? That's where I'm at with police. 

As for my race, I'm neither of the ones you mentioned, but I do have darker skin. Maybe I'm just crazy, but maybe, skin color shouldn't make a difference when it comes to how you're treated. Maybe, just maybe...

I’ll emphasize how crucial it is to get that drywall out of there quickly and have fans circulating air as soon as possible. Dehumidifiers are a must, FEMA will reimburse you 1 up to $250.00 max. SAVE THAT RECEIPT. Oddly enough they’ll reimburse you the same for a humidifier as well. I’m sure there’s a reason, but I can’t think of it. You know what, get you one of those too, you’ll need one sooner or later. 

It was recommended that we drill holes in our bottom cabinetry, which we did. Many did not and the mold eventually took over. You need new lower cabinets, drill the holes and spray the Clorox/Water deep in them.

Your countertops. This is important. They need to come off too. YOU MUST VIDEO their removal. Hire what FEMA would consider to be an “expert” (broad term, basically someone who’s in the business of countertops). FEMA will reimburse things like broken marble and granite, but only if you can show your adjuster VIDEO proof that the “expert” was unable to remove the countertops without breaking them. I filmed a guy putting all of his weight as a lever trying to remove them to no avail. This got me $8,900 extra for replacing my countertops, but only because the adjuster had the proof.

During your demo, if possible, appoint someone to audit what’s being thrown away. So many things are salvageable but if you have volunteers helping they have a one track mind...Demo. We threw away thousands of dollars needlessly.

&gt;What is anarchism?

Anarchism is a political philosophy and/or a set of political theories which aims to create anarchy. Anarchy often misinterpreted as chaos in this case means its roots; an meaning absence and archos meaning rulers. This means a stateless society based on non-hierarchical free associations. There are a lot of schools of thought; mutualism, communism, primitivism, etc.,  much like how there are a lot of political parities in liberal democracy.

&gt;Why is anarchism necessary?

Because you and I know how to run our own lives better than anyone else. We know what we need and we know what we want, and state authority is unnecessary at best and harmful at worst. Therefore creating a society that rejects coercive unjust hierarchies (yes *some* hierarchies can be just, but a good rule of thumb is **no hierarchies**) and promotes our autonomy and cooperation is in the best interest of everyone.

&gt;What are the issues with Western society from the anarchist point of view?(also please explain why they are problems deserving of change, no matter how obvious it may seem)

Coercive unjust hierarchies:

* The State - as stated above, you know how to run your life and the state has a history of regularly interfering with and oppressing individuals to propagate itself or benefit the people in charge. It also holds monopoly on the use of violence and uses it on any challenge to its authority. Basically, it is the tool used to oppress for the benefit of the ruling class.

* Capitalism - This is a big one, but I will try to lay out the basics. The choice between death by starvation or the elements and laboring for someone else is not a choice - it is slavery with more steps. There is no other choice because all the land is owned and using it would violate property rights, even if said property is vacant or undeveloped. Which is why even market anarchists don't believe in private property, instead replacing it with personal and collective property where ownership is established by use. And you personally may have gained your property lawfully in this system, but you don't have to [look back very far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonialism) to see that the vast majority of property and wealth in this system has been gained through the unjust use of violence and is hardly has a legitimate claim. Then there is end-state capitalism, when a single person or a small group accumulate all the wealth, which would develop a worldwide oligarchy or absolute monarchy - either way it's feudalism again. In 2012, America's 1% owned 33%, or 42% depending on the study, which grew from 6%, or 9%, in 1992, so the signs are pointing to end-state capitalism being an actual possibility.

* Imperialism - Historically, imperialism has been used to justify the disenfranchisement of native peoples' wealth by an invading force. 

* Organized Religion -  There are Christian anarchists, Muslim anarchists, and Taoist anarchists, so the problem is not with the spiritual part of religion, rather the unjust authority that religious leaders and the structures around them have on the layman and his community, derived rather than prescribed, from religious text.

* Racial Supremacy and the Patriarchy - Okay, if I need to go in depth I will, but to us save us both time I will assume that we both know that racism and sexism are wrong. Therefore hierarchies based on race or sex must be dealt with, regardless of how prominent you personally may or may not believe they are.

* Homophobia, Trans-phobia, and Ableism - I separated this from racial supremacy and the patriarchy, because it is a visibly newer issue. Regardless of what your religion says or if you think the pronoun thing is stupid, these are not choices. These can stem from birth or from accident, and to treat living thinking humans as lesser because of things beyond their control is not a just hierarchy, no ifs or ands about it.

&gt;What is the plan of action to resolve these issues?

Confront and dismantle those unjust hierarchies in our society. How this is done is where the schools of thought come into play. For instance, to some insurrectionist anarchists, illegalism is good praxis. While anarcho-syndicalists believe the way to freedom is revolutionary unionism to gain control of the economic control and then overthrow and replace the State and capitalism.  Some can be accelerationists, who do their best to force capitalism and technology until automation replaces labor and forces change. Lots of people are trying different tactics, but generally direct action, from Food Not Bombs, to protest, to unionizing, and theory are the best ways to convince people of anarchy's viability. And, honestly, we need to stop being the fringe for the really big changes.

&gt;What is the endgame if anarchism? Do you think it is realistic or achievable given some of the nasty truths about human behavior?

The endgame of anarchism also depends on the school. Mutualists still believe in markets, primitivists want to live in pre-""civilized"" society, anarcho-communists want true communism without the vanguard dictatorship of the proletariat of the USSR. But a stateless society of non-hierarchical free association is pretty much a must. Finally, honestly, yeah I do. When people talk about human nature, they always talk about only the bad parts, and if human nature was only the bad parts, then we wouldn't be here. We achieve great feats through cooperation and building on the knowledge others have passed down to us.",1504224476

For example: fish in the sea are definitely rivalrous, but presently we do not have a method of excluding people from them effectively. Finding such a method is a crucial step towards making them property and solving the tragedy of the commons as it relates to them.

But there is literally no reason to make practically non-scarce goods property. Even a purely rivalrous and excludable good, doesn't need to be made into property, if it can be found in nigh unlimited amounts. Air (although it is also non-excludable) is abundant enough, that nobody bothers to make it property. Until someone bottles it adn transfroms it into a different scarce good.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","Fair assessment on the Tracer point, though I have a lot of time on healers as well. For Tracer, it's definitely more expected for the exact reasons you said, and I can deal with that. It's when I was playing anybody else that I had a problem with the old Hog. When you're properly positioned as a healer or say using Reaper to help healers with a diving Winston, get hooked out of nowhere and die before you can even get an ability off, it's absolute bs. That's why I like the new Hog. If you hook someone, you can still create space, do a fair amount of damage, and either get a kill with a second shot or some team help, or at least make the hooked enemy peel. 

I fully agree with you about running the proper team comp regardless of which version of Hog you want to throw into the picture. Unfortunately, we all know how stubborn people can be. That's an entirely different conversation, though the old hook being able to hook someone from point A on Anubis to Gibraltor (think that was the old joke) was just a little ridiculous. 

Also agree with you on the Pharah example, and that was part of the point I was making. You can't stop everything. Eventually one of the other five members of the enemy team is going to do something that leaves your team defenceless, so you can't say that a hook can always be stopped. ",1504224478

"StreetFighter","t5_2qnu5","I actually think state and regional size events are more important now than they’ve ever been. Not only is it financially unreasonable to expect players to travel to massive tournaments frequently, but the ability to level up regularly against known competition, in my opinion, is what keeps players invested in their scenes. Sometimes those local tournaments, think NLBC or WNF here, are what inspire the global community. 

I think the biggest risk small tournaments have nowadays is the notion that they need to be larger tournaments. Many of the most personally rewarding tournaments I’ve attended have been 50-100 player tri-state-area brackets. Almost all the tournaments where I’ve taken the time to really sit down and learn match-ups with character specialists have been at tournaments that scale or smaller as well. Local and regional scale tournaments are a deeply needed part of the eco-system.

I do think that the emergence of official leagues will continue to reshape what convention scale and single title fighting game tournaments look like, but for me their arrival puts more importance on the smaller tourneys sustaining the player base. I am very interested in a fighting game community that always produces more players than fans, and the only path forward I see that allows for that revolves around community-recognized local level tournaments.",1504224478

While the premise of this combo seems basic, the Stronghold is the foundation of many advanced tactics, one of which we've already talked about previously [here](https://forum.tricksterarts.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1346).

[ICE Walls](http://hackersthegame.wikia.com/wiki/ICE_Wall) have a very fast install time, and can quickly shield a node against attacks, enabling the installation of the slower, stronger [Protector](http://hackersthegame.wikia.com/wiki/Protector), which will regenerate itself while under attack, enabling you to launch an assault without worrying about losing your ground.

A great use of this tactic is to secure nodes with lots of program slots that can be used to cause chaos! Securing a Black ICE or a Guardian in the heart of a network can cause devastation when it is properly defended.

Additionally, if you used the [Flanking](https://forum.tricksterarts.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&amp;t=1427) tactic mentioned last time to capture a weak shortcut, you can also use this combo to quickly secure a node, while setting up for a Sweeper  combo which uses Protector instead of Shocker, or one the combos coming next time ...

----
If it's not a serial port and the application really does have a real USB driver (whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy) you'll have to use a VirtualBox VM and USB passthrough.

It's pretty easy to do, you just need a Windows VM ([free ones from MS wink wink nudge nudge](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)), pass the USB device through, and then install the application from within the VM as normal.

----

&gt; How stupendously difficult would it be to port the program to work in Linux, so I wouldn't need to use Wine at all??

If the application is well developed, it shouldn't take much work. Based on the screenshots, I can basically guarantee you that this is a badly done WinForms application, it would basically be a rewrite.

And that's if you can even get access to the source code. Given that the dev is a dick:

An explanation on the definition of bone-hurting juice jokes.docx
Before claims of destroying the fun of jokes by explaining them in full, I present to you the example of an apprentice magician:
Whilst explaining the trick behind a magician’s illusion may rid you of the spectacle of the show. To an aspiring magician, there is fun within the craft itself.
Of course, there may be no need for this as you may understand BHJ fully purely from examples. You may not want to taint your freestyle nature by reading this; but on the other hand it may prove beneficial to do so. Jokes are simply another creative art.
Aim
The definition of bone-hurting juice memes has been one of great confusion and disarray over the past few months between content submitters and moderators of r/bonehurtingjuice. This report will be an attempt to clear up the definition of this great style of comedy and offer a succinct idea of a BHJ meme true to its holders’ and submitters’ definition. Further, this report will also hope to standardize the lowest quality of a BHJ joke furthering the quality of BHJ memes as a whole.
Definition
A bone-hurting juice joke is a joke which achieves a logical twist on a concept’s normal understanding from a completely ignorant perspective.
A Further Explanation of the Definition
The Concept
The concept could really be anything. It is not purely restricted to the medium of images, or humour online.
The easier a concept is to misinterpret, the easier it is to create a BHJ meme- however this may also lead to lazy/uncreative twists, so it is not by definition the best choice. Very little weight is reliant on the concept of the joke; most of it is reliant on the creativity of the twist.
If humour is derived purely from the concept, the joke is not considered a BHJ. If the humour is mainly derived from the concept, it may be considered a lazy or uncreative BHJ joke at best.
The Twist
There are 3 important parts to the twist. These may be easier to understand within the context of Case Studies (Section 3).
The twist itself
If this is not respected then you have simply created an anti-meme.
A completely ignorant perspective
This is the main defining part of a bone-hurting juice meme. ENTER MORE TEXT HERE
The logical nature of the twist
If the audience cannot understand a logical tie between the concept and its twist, then you have failed entirely in creating a BHJ joke. The logic must obviously lie within the ignorant perspective. Furthermore, the logic must not be forced by way of editing at all. Otherwise you have completely failed to create a joke within the idea of BHJ.
Notes on logic:
In my own opinion, I would like to add another layer to this definition as I feel it is very important. However, note that this is not the opinion adopted by the community just yet. I hope you will understand and accept my addition.
I believe that the twist of a BHJ joke should not just be logical from a completely ignorant perspective, but rather logical and moronic from an ignorant perspective. I feel that if this distinction is not made then you can create an intelligent twist on an ignorant level which will simply be a very artistic. (See: Beginner’s Eye). Moreover, creating a twist which is simply not moronic or intelligent is difficult to call a joke. All appreciation or humour which is gained from such an attempt is purely from an understanding of an elitist perspective of how the content was created within an ignorant perspective, or the mindset of a 10 year old if you will. It does not lend itself to a general audience at all, and lends itself with difficulty to a BHJ friendly audience. It may fall within the realm of BHJ, but I would give it no respect as a joke.
Edits are completely legal if used to set up the concept or to help with the understanding of the twist. It is only incorrect if used to force a punch line.
If you fail to create a logical tie, yet the joke is still funny, then you will find the humour in some nonsensical randomness or the concept itself.
Again, I will further explore these in the next section of Case Studies if you’re finding this all a bit difficult to understand!
Case Studies
I will apply my definition to a variety of examples I have found on the bonehurtingjuice subreddit, and further sources such as cartoons. This is a fun and interesting exercise to do to test the definition, or test your own creations upon my definition if it is accepted.
haha ive not done this yet u stinky idiot heads
Final Notes
I advise that the moderators not use this as a ruleset to ban and strictly moderate submission posts, but rather have this as a guideline to advise content creators towards the heart of BHJ. In fact, this report should reduce the need of strict moderation as users will have a much clearer understanding when posting, allowing for a more a free and happy environment within this community.",1504224484

Giftrocket sounded almost too good to be true to me and I'm glad to hear that there doesn't seem to be any issues with it. I heard that GR codes need to be redeemed right away in case the customer tries to do a chargeback or something. I was concerned that if a customer made enough of a stink about it that they could find out your account information. That's not possible, is it? And can they do that with Amazon?

I even saw some sites suggesting opening up a separate bank account without your real name attached and I didn't even know if that was possible. What other payment methods do you think are the most anonymous?

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Without using anything like law of sines or law of cosines, here's a way you can solve this just by using the Pythagorean theorem and some algebraic equation solving.

Draw the altitude from B to AC and have it intersect AC at point D.

Label the unknown distance AD = x.

Label the unknown distance DC = (21 – x).

You know those two distances add up to 21 because AC = 21.

Now consider right triangle BAD. It has hypotenuse 10 and one leg is x. So you can write a description of BD^2 by using Pythagorean theorem.

10^2 = x^2 + BD^2

10^2 – x^2 = BD^2

Now consider triangle BCD. It's also a right triangle. It has hypotenuse 17 and leg (21 – x). You can find a different expression for BD^2 again using Pythagorean theorem.

17^2 = (21 – x)^2 + BD^2

17^2 – (21 – x)^2 = BD^2

Now simply equate these two different expressions for BD^2.

10^2 – x^2 = 17^2 – (21 – x)^2

Do some expanding on the right side by expressing (21 – x)(21 – x) as a trinomial. Carefully subtract that trinomial from 17^2 by distributing the minus sign. Then get rid of the –x^2 from both sides. Keep working until you determine what x is using equation solving steps.

Finally, once you know what x is, you can also say what (21 – x) is, so you'll know the lengths of AD and DC.

Final step will be to find BD exactly, knowing AB = 10 and knowing what AD is exactly, using Pythagorean theorem. 

Hint: The answer for length BD turns out to be a whole number.",1504224484

""Economic freedom"" is not something you can unambiguously quantify and directly measure, so you have to invent some proxy for it. Your beloved heritage method of defining and measuring economic freedom is ""anything we feel like is economic freedom"". More sophisticated economic freedom indices, such that of the Fraser Institute, take at least somewhat measurable economic data (weighs it in some arbitrary way - a clear indication that they are attempting to demonstrate their point in advance, instead of study something scientifically!) and then obtain their index. This includes factors such as taxes and rule of law. But when you look at the parts which you think of ""economic freedom"", such as low government spending or taxes, they actually influence economic growth negatively (!) as demonstrated in this very large-sample size study: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michael_Stroup/publication/4775015_Which_Economic_Freedoms_Contribute_to_Growth/links/00b495319fd21dbba2000000.pdf

In other words economic freedom indices are not an attempt at scientific study, but are rather propaganda. 

The fact that countries that have a huge state-owned share in the economy, such as Chile or Singapore, have high economic freedom ranking, whereas countries with almost no government spending, nor taxes, such as Bangladesh, have low economic freedom, should give you pause for thought to think critically about what economic freedom indices are, but probably won't.

It was in his blood through the Winchester side of the family.  Just like with Dean being Michaels vessel.  The only thing I was unclear of is if Azazel held the knowledge that Sam was Lucifer's vessel.  Not that it truly mattered because if Sam had stayed dead and Jake had freed Lucifer, I assume that Lucifer would then just resurrect Sam himself since he has that in his power.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A head-on crash between a truck (Ford F-250) and a small car (VW Voyage). I was on a bus (chartered, on a 30-mile trip from my city and university) back from class. We were not the first to arrive at the hit scene, but we were in front of the scene.
[GRAPHIC] It was possible to see everything. The Voyage driver died. The Voyage was completely destroyed, and the body was visible (the accident had occurred minutes before and the highway police had not arrived). Those who approached said that there were several marks of trauma on the body and that one hand was torn. Since we could not go anywhere until the coroner analyzed the scene and cleaned the place, we observed emergency services isolating the site, covering the body (obvious reasons), the coroner working and a hearse taking the body away. [/GRAPHIC]

We got stuck on the scene for about 3 hours. When the news indicated that the driver who died apparently slept behind the wheel, I wondered how life could end up in a way we could not even imagine. I've seen grotesque things, but this was something I saw in real life and it hit me hard. The people in the truck had only minor injuries.

Months later, while I was on the same trip, a driver (a Corolla) attempted to make an illegal overtaking and almost involved the bus that I was in an accident (but caused the rear collision between two cars that were in the opposite direction and resulted in a injured child).

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","The point of the Arcade as a whole was to give players other options to play the game differently and take a breather to have more fun than just basic Quick play or Competitive. The mains ones being there is simply due to them being the most popularly played to allow an easier access to them for the sake of the players. It's also why they remove previous game modes like No Limits or Capture the Flag from the main arcade page, since the players actually playing is so small, they would be better off giving that space to something else entirely. Which is where custom games come in as game modes for the more niche options. 

 If Mystery Deathmatch is truly that desired by the playerbase, then Blizzard will take note of it. A big reason why Blizzard broke their word on the whole ""no deathmatchs all objectives"" rule is because so many members of the community craved it, and it was shown a ton in custom games as well as Quick Play. Deathmatch has just hit live this week, and wasn't on the PTR that long so it's way too quick to already want to ""shake things up"". Just wait a little while, experiment with the idea in custom games, then see how people feel about it then instead of wanting a new variant of the game two days after it's hit live.",1504224490

Churches aren't automatically tax-exempt, they have to earn it through verified  endeavors for the public good that are not tied up with their religion. (no selling e-meter readings [a $59.99 value!] or restricting charity to people that partake in their religious services.)

Clarify that the bill of rights isn't something that is handed out only to citizens, that they are absolute limits placed on the government and cannot be denied to any human being by the government.

Foreign corporations cannot buy land, only rent/lease it.  Foreign citizens *can* buy land, but can only sell it to US citizens, and upon the foreign citizen's death it is sold for its appraised value - no inheritance of land by non-citizens.

No H1-B visas at all.  If a company wants to hire someone for a job, they have to be here already.  If there's no qualified applicants, they either do without or they train someone who is already here.

Patents and copyrights expire after 40 years, congress cannot pass legislation to extend it.

All government records become public after 20 years - the exception being if they pertain to individuals that are still undercover or sources that are still in place; those get an extension until they pass away or leave their cover/position.

You husband sounds like he would feel completely emasculated if you were the sole earner. This would ultimately breed resentment toward you, and that's just the beginning. 

Let's say finding a job becomes more difficult than you think it will be. Let's say months have passed, hundreds of resumes have been handed out, a few good interviews done, and still everyone keeps passing up your husband for younger people.  That will be so detrimental to his self worth, and I think you know that. 

I'm sure his job is upsetting him, but I also think being jobless will feel worse. If anything I think you should be helping to guide him away from the terrible choices he is making in the job he currently has. 

You don't fight with your boss. You don't yell at your boss. You don't disrespect your boss in any way. Even if your boss pissed you off, even if he is younger than you, even if he is your best friend.

Perhaps it has something to do with microtubules. These are nanoscopic structures in the brain which emit fields of energy, but nobody knows exactly how or why.

No it wasn't the FBI's mandate.  It was the State Department's mandate.

Why shouldn't she defer to Comey if she felt she might be biased?  That wasn't setting a precedent, it was following one.

"samharris","t5_2thqg","&gt;  So how can you say that you are you 20 years later, but you can't say you're you 5 meters away from you in reference to that person who you have a lot in common with?

You can say it in a scientific sense, there's a continuum from your child body to your current one. And in that sense of ""you"", you can also tell because you have at least some of the memories of one but not of the other. But yeah, from a ""self"" perspective it's weird.

&gt;  If you feel a self then you can claim that during that time you experience the feeling of a self, but you can't use that feeling to claim the existance of it, even if it is only during the time you have it.

Ok then. The meaning of ""self"" we are talking about then, is something that can be felt when it doesn't exist, but if it does exist, it must be felt, and its permanent. So the fact that at times you can feel only X means that whatever is not X that you feel at times has to be an illusion. I haven't done drugs but I wouldn't be surprised if it was possible to experience some very weird things, like the feeling that we are all one and the same or something. I wonder what that implies in this argument.

&gt;   Or like Sam said, you might have more in common with another person now, than you do with your ""self"" 10 years ago. So how can you say that you are you 20 years later, but you can't say you're you 5 meters away from you in reference to that person who you have a lot in common with?

Yeah, that's a subject I haven't thought about a lot, but it gets weirder the more I think about it. i got no good intuitions. It gets weird in support and in opposition to Sam's position too. I mean, mindfulness doesn't just make you see those experiences as external, but also enhances somehow your awareness, that ""permanent self"". So is that enhanced part of the self not self because its not permanent? Where's your permanent self when you are caught up in thought, when you are asleep but not dreaming, in a comma, when you lived but then blacked out, etc? And thought experiments can get very weird. Anyway, from that perspective I see your point. I just find the issue too confusing to take a strong position, which again makes me not feel comfortable defending Sam's claims of ""illusion"".",1504224500

I started dating about three weeks after the break-up and we went on four dates before I invited him to my home to play video games. Our dates weren't terribly expensive and we both paid for ourselves. We're somewhat shy and natural listeners so they all included a couple drinks at a bar to get us actually talking to each other. One date was a trivia night and another included a movie, but I never spent more than $30.00 on myself.

It's easy to feel like you don't know if you're making the right choice when dating, but I think you're best off inviting her over to show you're interested in keeping the relationship moving forward.",1504224501

"DCcomics","t5_2qlmm","If you're going to read ANY Rebirth series, you should read the [DC Universe: Rebirth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1401270727) event first—it's only like 80 pages. 

If you start reading Flash: Rebirth, there are 2 pages in the first issue that deal with Watchmen/batcave and maybe a little more than that dealing with Wally West. Then, there's 20 issues of new Barry Allen -focused Flash story until The Button crossover with Batman from #21-22. 

Everyone should probably *know* character origins, but actually hunting down and reading all of them first? Knowing they will be addressed over and over again? In my experience, new readers tend to obsess over origins because it's a familiar storytelling structure: start at the beginning. For example, let's say you start reading a new Batman comic: did you understand all of the references made to earlier comics in continuity? Should you start reading the older comics now? Should you start all the way back in the 1930's to fully understand Batman's story progression? One of the greatest modern Batman runs (Morrison) heavily references silver age comics. This compulsion is applicable to origins. Don't you want to know what character origins were before the newest became canon? Origins can change every time a new creative team is assigned to a character. More importantly, which of the many origins are actually good stories? 

Superhero comics were built with few beginnings and lengthy interconnected story-lines that span years and years. Ultimately, for a majority of characters, you only need like 2-3 sentences to understand them and provide enough context for jumping into modern comics. I mean, do what you gotta do. This is just my opinion.",1504224501

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Society, especially in for teens and young adults, puts a huge emphasis on the importance of relationships. I think that the fixation on sex specifically is just a touch more complicated due to the age range of the people involved with that sub. 

The sexual climate for someone in the 18-24 range is far different from that of someone in their 30s. Millenials can be very shallow, and tend to define themselves largely on their conquests. Johnny incel sees Chad. Chad is happy. Chad swings his dick around. Chad gets ladies. To someone who has little to no life experience it would be pretty easy to believe that chad is happy and swinging his dick because he gets laid. It's kind of like the fat kid that thinks all of his social problems will go away if he loses weight, then loses the weight and ends up more miserable when he realizes that he's still the same person he was when he was fat. I know this because I was said fat kid at one point. 

The fixation on sex, or rather the lack of sex seems to be a defense mechanism. Accountability is like kryptonite to incels. They want to get women, but lack the social skills. Rather than working on that, they choose to believe it's because of their appearance. Since they believe that they look like Quasimodo, they develop weird, romanticized fantasies. Obviously women are skanky whores. Why else would they not want to accept the penis of a nice guy like myself? Never mind that I'm an asshole that never has anything good to say. It's obvious that the only reason is that she wants to gobble Chad's foot long sub. Personality doesn't matter. Otherwise she'd be throwing herself at me. 

This is then compounded by the cult like echo chamber that is r/incels. I'm already a bitter asshole. Now I have a whole community of parasitic assholes like myself. They're as bad to each other as they are to us. One gets a date, somehow, and the rest convince him that she's a roastie whore who's going to dip out as soon as Stacy removes Chad's foot long from her throat. It would be too hard to be happy for him, because any amount of social success challenges the very fabric of their belief system. They know that not having sex isn't the end of the world, but the second they acknowledge this, the whole house of cards comes tumbling down. 

I realized about halfway through this that some of this may be offensive to you, as I don't know exactly how you feel about most of these issues. I mean no disrespect, I just wanted to give a legitimate answer to your query. ",1504224502

2 - 20-40+ mins of foreplay (toys, hard fast stimulation various positions) and 5-10 mins of sex, fast hard lots of doggy style, bent over, face down just fucking.


Foreplay , as you get older (foreplay when I was 20 was to warm up, now that I'm 36 it's where most of her orgasms occurs) the foreplay becomes the main event, PIV becomes the desert.",1504224503

for all the talk about intellectual honesty, democrats by and large jump on this band wagon that russia made trump win, and any contact that anyone in the trump administration(something all candidates do, how many candidates go to Israel as part of their campaign!) was painted as nefarious and even treasonous!

now we sit closer to nuclear war than ever before, because during the cold war the soviet union had red lines and we saw them clearly.
today the united states sees no red lines and russia still has enough nukes to end humanity ready **to launch on warning, that is launch when they think we have launched our and not when they have confirmed a nuclear detonation because it will already be to late.**

Current MLS owners have really had to go out on a limb financially to buy into the league (over and above investment in a stadium/players). I don't see any reason for them to agree to a pro/rel system (even with parachute payments and keeping their stake in SUM) unless lower tier teams have to pay a significant entry fee to get into MLS, beyond the stadium/team investment that they needed to get promoted. This is theoretically feasible, but it would make any pro/rel look really different than in Europe (in that there will only be a small handful of teams who are able to get promoted, regardless of their play on the field) for the foreseeable future.

I do agree that constant tension on the dog's neck is not a good thing; I've countered this by only attaching it to a harness, which is only worn during flexi walks or hikes. This way, my dogs have stayed attentive at all other times during normal heeled walks and don't pull. 

I definitely think most people who use flexis shouldn't and do so because they assume it's just easier to give more freedom than train the dog, but I have to say, I feel they can really be great tools for dogs already well-trained with low prey drive in low traffic areas. ",1504224505

Whenever I play with less skilled players it causes me to play with a lot of hesitation because I can never tell when my teammates or opponents are going to whiff or make a successful hit. Not only that but platinum players are not as consistent with proper rotations and concede a lot more goals from my experience.

I just think each rank has a skill level they play at (obviously) and it can be awkward to tone down your skill and try and play in accordance with less skilled teammates.

Regardless, most people refuse to counter, share opinion, or prove wrong in any shape or form.  And, if they do, they say things that could only happen if they do not participate in the affected game play at regular intervals.  Like ""I play every day and have never seen any bugs!"" when a patch drops to fix recently DLC added issues shortly after them saying that.

If they don't see them, that does not mean no one else is seeing them anyway.  On PC, there is a plethora of hardware and software combinations.  Including drivers and add ons.  And, console is it's own issue beast.  Yet, they down vote and claim lies or ignorance because they haven't while multiple people are discussing the issue.  That's without throwing in trolls, shill accounts, employees, and fanboys.  

Look.  If someone shows me where I am wrong, I accept and thank.  That's not how it usually goes.  And, it's not because I'm always right or something.  Most just mass down vote and say nothing.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","Hello! My name is Mark Adams, I am a video game designer and developer. For the past year, I have been working on a _very_ special game, catered to a specific group of people. This game is called ""Daddy isn't home yet™"". This game will take place on a warm summers day in the Adams household, where Alice Adams, George Adams and Mark Adams live. Alice and George are step siblings whom have developed a crush on each other, after all, they were best friends in high school before George's mom married Alice's dad. George's mom sadly passed away in November 2013, leaving just the three alone. Mark often worked long hours away from home, leaving the two teens alone..but they didn't mind. The goal of this game is to successfully seduce and sleep with your step sibling, being able to choose whether you want to play as Alice or George. There will be a timer for when daddy comes home, let's hope he doesn't catch you.",1504224507

I buy broken equipment, fix it and end up getting stuff for about a quarter of the price.  But a home user can't do this.  So they pay a premium.  If you want to game, the 4k iMac comes with a 4GB Radeon 555.  It's a great unit.

If you haven't heard of it already, you should definitely check out my custom made desktop application.


It generates over a hundred scripts for which you make your choices from within a GUI desktop application using checkboxes, drop down lists, text boxes etc... And it contains snippets of code, examples and general assistance to create a mission from A to Z. Little to no coding experience is required.


Create a briefing. Spawn patrols according to your parameters. Run special scripts for added immersion. Add your own preview and overlay images. Add a UAV intro. Create animation loops. Set respawn and view distance settings. There's so much to discover and create with this program. And test it all in real-time!


But most of all, you can use the plug N play feature which creates random tasks with random types and amounts of enemy units according to the objective and the number of players. Location, terrain, opfor, and task at hand all mix to make the current objective unique and challenging in its own way each time.

It's when Marty travels back to 1955, that he experiences 100% first hand that she as a teenager was everything she warned Marty against.

The impact of her hypocrisy wouldn't have been as great if it hadn't have been Marty that she was so zealously throwing herself at.

Like the whole business model is just to milk the ""whales"" who will just shell out copious amounts of money because otherwise the game's design isnt fun. 

Add in an inherent lack of mechanics due to a phone's limited control scheme...and the games aren't generally that complex. 

Mobile games are also trapped in the painful place of only being able to either be Free2Play models or only being like $5 or less...not to mention the painfully saturated market...so there are plenty of other limitations too.

"Divorce","t5_2qipv","I've got a similar situation. More kids, more infidelity, more gas lighting, less religion. 

I've been staying home with the kids for 10 years. I'm finishing my degree but there is NO WAY I can support the kids until I do, and we are going to co parent in peace. 

I want to go out and meet someone and just feel normal and have companionship but it is exactly the way you described. Whether in person or online, all anyone wants is a hook up. Guys seem so used to vapid women or loose women or small talk and getting buzzed enough to hook up. I'm just none of that. It will probably take a long time to find a guy who I click with who isn't trying to just hit and quit. 

Coffee shops are 100% less social than I was led to believe, book stores are a sad no. I get guys who I can tell want to say hi but they just chicken out. I have thought of approaching a few times but they seem to duck out or something right when I have my mind made up to do the hard part and say hello!

Meetups are ok if you have a hobby that's mostly full of guys, but like I said, most men seem met are really intimidated for some reason. I'm not loud or bossy or obnoxious or anything, but they seem skid dish, like deer. And I've never had a woman approve my request to join the meet up for ladies groups or mixed groups run by ladies. 

I decided I'm going to take all that frustration and pour it all into school. I'm finishing this degree, then devoting my life to getting rich. I had to sit on the sidelines and take shit my whole life while he ran everything I did into the ground, it's ME TIME. 

If someone comes along, that'll be welcome. Meanwhile, maybe I'll become ok with just getting laid instead of having a meaningful relationship (idk though, I could probably never do a one night stand or hookup).

Its scary and sucks. Spent my whole life working for others and to stop on a dime and focus all on me is scary and feels selfish. And apparently I'm as attractive as the swamp thing.

CAT also built a phone with a case similar to the Active line from Samsung.  Other than the fact that parts aren't available at all, and it's still a glass screen.  Building a case into a phone that's likely to be dropped is pointless when shock damage is the biggest factor for screens breaking.

The built in cases are enough sometimes, external ones are enough sometimes, but at the end of the day, the issue isn't the cases, it's the screens durability.  And IMO Samsung will lose that particular point 100% of the time.  LCD's have no good reason to have the first layer as tempered glass other than to make a secondary breakage point that kills the phone.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","So your picks like to dive/assassinate, are AP, and are strongest mid game. I would recommend to pick a backline carry, an AD champion, and a tanky top laner.

Backline carries for the mid lane I recommend are: 

Viktor: Easy to play, can mindlessly shove waves, lane bully in most matchups, great late game scaling and teamfighting. Ok roaming and some poor matchups.

Ahri: Easy to play, can mindlessly shove waves, kill pressure in most matchups, good mid-game spike with good roaming and dive potential that you'll be used to.

Taliyah: Somewhat difficult to play but the reward is large. She  has great lane pressure, roaming, and teamfighting. Probably one of the strongest mid laners right now.

Orianna: Great all-around mid laner that can help your team. You can combo her ulti with your teammates and she has good late-game teamfight.

Cho'gath, Maokai, Shen, J4, and Gragas are all good tanks for the top lane.

For a good champion pool, you really only need 2-3 champions that cover a range of bases. A great mid champion pool could be Kassadin, TF, and Corki. For myself, I've mostly played Zed, Syndra, TF, and Viktor for this season. I have teamfighters, roamers, divers, supportive playstyles, single-target burst, and a mix of AP/AD in my pool.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","Case against Pryor:

1) Browns played in a lot of garbage time, so they needed to pass the ball a lot.

2) Browns were one of the teams that called the fewest running plays last season (if not dead last).

3) Coleman was out five weeks last season, which made Pryor the only consistent weapon for the Browns to throw to...No matter who was behind center.

4) Pryor was arguably the best pass catcher on the Browns squad, especially with coleman out.


Now, with Washington you get a better QB...yes, but 

1) Washington will run the ball WAY more than Cleveland did last season (hell, Cleveland will run the ball more than they did last season)

2) Jordan Reed when he's on the field and Jamison Crowder are far superior than anything Cleveland had on the field with Pryor, plus they already know the Redskins playbook and have rapport with Cousins.

3) Washington will not be the Browns and will not be playing in garbage time as often as Cleveland did last season.


In a nutshell, Pryor is talented but his stats were inflated by a perfect storm pass heavy situation in Cleveland last season where he was the main (and at times the only) weapon for QBs.",1504224516

I'd rather take the long way and grab a drive through coffee on the way. $5 each way on the Gateway Bridge if you're doing airport to Gold Coast? Same factor comes in, except it's half the cost. 


Combine that with the lack of payment options that the toll operator puts into their system - there's no over the counter customer service point anywhere, the electronic payment system is poorly designed and prone to problems that are blamed on the consumer, and when you can find a retailer that does over the counter sales, the operator often doesn't know how to process the sale because they don't get the volume of sale to learn it.",1504224517

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Well it may or may not be. However here's one example from Korean food in particular. In the 70s and early 80s beef was a rare delicacy in Korea. The country was in shambles and just pulling itself together. Koreans that came to LA found that they could have rare dishes every single day of the week if they really wanted to. What happened over the years with this is that popular Korean food slowly turned from traditional dishes to Americanized ""land of plenty"" style all you can eat KBBQ. However the new millennials who want to explore and the increased presence of Korean food in LA consciousness has caused a re-explosion in traditional dishes. Now you can find anything you'd find in Korea in LA with better or the same quality in ingredients alongside fusion. The trick is to not completely let it get commercialized the way say Italian food was in America. Tomato sauce is pretty rare in Italian food for example but here it's a staple. 

This is currently going on with Mexican and Central American food in LA too. It's harder and rarer to find good meat, avocados, and fresh produce in Latin America. However in LA it's cheap and plentiful. So you can have fresh tacos from a cheap truck whereas the beef supplier for a cart in Tijuana may have dubious quality. This is probably less true for traditional dishes like molé that are time consuming and labor intensive and are just as good in Mexico as they are in LA.",1504224518

"Plumbing","t5_2slqb","if you take a pre-apprenticeship course, the school will usually expose you to various options (plumbing, pipefitting, sprinklerfitting even welding) in a foundation course. given your question, imo, learning rural water systems incl agricultural irrigation + how to work and design systems for solar water pumps may be useful esp considering the fed gov pussyfooting with cannabis legalization. if they dont implement a plant limit for recreational home growers, the sky, or rather, the depth of your aquifer, is the limit. rural water systems are usually part of the 3rd and 4th year plumbing curriculum here in bc but find that rural folk tend to not care as much about local codes as much so long as the piping/well/irrigation system does what it's intended to do. so if you do a pre-apprenticeship course, don't be afraid to ask about the areas of plumbing that interest you as it is much more than fixing toilets. 

the thing with technological unemployment is that there will still be human problems to be solved by humans. they say service sector jobs will be among the first to be automated in this fourth industrial revolution. most service jobs are in the city (e.g london, uk is 80% services afaik) so where will people move to if there aren't any jobs left in the city? another reason to learn rural systems is self-sufficiency and the nature of some housing markets here. canada has a lot of untapped fresh water and a populace largely priced out of metropolitan housing (be it from lack of residential housing supply and increased artificial demand created by investors both domestic and foreign). lots of people work from home these days and if you query white collared professionals living in places like vancouver many (25-50%) may have or are working on a back-up plan to move and/or cash out of the city because it's not worth the costs. of that pool, many would move to toronto or some other city but rural land is cheap and can come with good water supply if surveyed and treated correctly. with natural gas prices being where they are right now, people can also set up their own electrical grid with generators and backups on a plot possibly even cheaper than or at parity with the state grid if it's an investment over a period of some years. you do the math.

if you're living in a major city with a hot real estate market, you could feed the beast and work residential construction which can translate over to rural housing as well. plumbers can pull $25,000 pure profit average all bills and labor paid job done in stages of maybe 2 to 3 weeks actual work over the course of 2-3 months. and that's per home. which can leave some time for other plumbing work opportunities be it on rural systems or city call-in service.

"IncelTears","t5_3kvtt","Some choice quotes from a narcissistic mass murderer:

Never insult the style of Elliot Rodger. I’m the most stylish person in the world. Just look at my profile pic. That’s just one of my fabulous outfits. The sweater I’m wearing in the picture is $500 from Neiman Marcus. 

I began to have fantasies of becoming very powerful and stopping everyone from having sex.

I have an exceptionally high level of intelligence. I see the world differently than anyone else. Because of all of the injustices I went through and the worldview I developed because of them, I must be destined for greatness. I must be destined to change the world, to shape it into an image that suits me!

He was my comrade in virginity, for he too didn’t get any attention from girls, and I’m sure he suffered from it, but not as much as I did. I was very perplexed as to why he didn’t feel any anger towards girls for denying him sex.

How could an inferior, ugly black boy be able to get a white girl and not me? I am beautiful, and I am half white myself. I am descended from British aristocracy. He is descended from slaves. I deserve it more.

I had never been a violent person in nature, but after building up so much hatred over the years, I realized that I wouldn’t hesitate to kill or even torture my hated enemies if I was given the opportunity.

After I picked up the handgun, I brought it back to my room and felt a new sense of power. I was now armed. Who’s the alpha male now, bitches?

I came across this Asian guy who was talking to a white girl. The sight of that filled me with rage.

White Separatists - want to carve out a white ethnostate. I see nothing wrong with this on the face of it, if they create their state through legal means. There are decent arguments in support of ethnostates, and several exist in the world today with varying degrees of success, and they are not considered evil. 

White Nationalists - want to make the US as a whole into a white ethnostate. Like separatism, I don't see this as necessarily bad; it he's down to how they accomplish it. If they can persuade most minorities to leave, and can persuade some other country to take them, then it is what it is, but this seems utterly impractical. 

White Supremacists - believe that white people are objectively superior to all other people. I find this position illogical and indefensible. 

In addition, anyone who promotes violence against other people against their fellow man on the basis of physical attributes, I consider to be evil. ",1504224520

"wow","t5_2qio8","This move by Blizzard is really counter-intuitive while keeping everyone on the edges of their seats. They've pulled an interface API from their subscribers that some of their staunchest supporters rely upon. But they've not filled the void left by its removal or addressed how they're thinking about it. I understand why they did it, but they need to show that there's a light at the end of the tunnel. 

I'm not sure why they didn't protect the guild frame and functions from UI's messing with it (if something accesses those APIs, throw an error), notified UI devs (so they can update to not touch that functionality), then started working on an activity threshold setting for guilds. 

This fills the void in two ways:

- Allows guild management while not mutilating UI addons.
- Allows people to prune inactives from their guilds.

The layout of the pruning would be quite simple. Set a threshold in number of days since last login with a rank threshold (don't kick people above X rank regardless of inactivity). Once that's set, they can schedule a weekly job that can go as slowly and use a ""nice"" setting as much as they want, but those that don't match the rules configured would be removed. 

Of course, none of that was done. Instead of using a scalpel for a sensitive API, they got blackout drunk, blindfolded themselves, spun around in circles for 20 minutes, then took a chainsaw to the problem. 

They've fixed the security problem, sure. They just left a massive void for legitimate use in its stead without any thought to adding anything to fill it, or so we know. 

Please consider doing *something* to fill the gap. ",1504224521

"thinkpad","t5_2qvhj","To everyone asking about gaming performance on more obscure GPUs like the M2200M: 

Here's a quick way to make an educated guess. It's not perfect primarily due to thermal and power limits on laptops, but it should get you a very good estimate. It's not as relevant now because Nvidia uses (essentially) the same GPU for both mobile and desktop, but back when, say, the 860M came out and we had no idea of how it would perform compared to the desktop GPUs that were already benchmarked thousands of times over by that point, this could get you a pretty spot-on estimate.

1. Look up the GPU (I used Wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Quadro#Quadro_M). 

2. Keep track of the information, with the ""Core"" column being the most imporant. The M2200M is based on the GM206 and has a core clock (base) of 1250 MHz and memory clock of 5500 MHz. The core config is 1024:64:32.

3. Look up the GM206 (or whichever one you got for the GPU you're looking at). I used Wikipedia again https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce_900_series.

4. There are two GeForce GPUs that are based on the GM206, the 950 and the 960 (desktop version). It looks like the clock speeds for the M2200M is somewhere between the clock speeds of those two. So we can conclude that the M2200M's performance will be somewhere between that of the 950 and the 960.",1504224526

So in a world where IP is here to stay I think there are big problems for the future where companies will have a huge amount of control, and the free market will fail badly in the way you describe.

You say a CNC router can't compete, but look at printing for example.  50 years ago you'd always have to go to an enormous factory to get stuff printed.  Now you can get perfect quality for a few hundred bucks.  There's no reason why 3d printing of metal and other materials can't get to that point (for low cost).  Especially when 3d printing 'feeds back' on itself and is used to create factory machines in the first place.

Lots of companies have pulled it off.  Facebook itself starting from nothing.  Microsoft and Apple started in garages etc..  For real companies I agree it's harder because of initial investment.  But with the right pitch investors will take care of the money side for you.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; Jews are also 1.8% of the population, their representation still doesn't make sense without extreme levels of nepotism and in group preference.

It does to a large degree. Consider two bell-curves of intelligence. One bell-curve is centered one whole standard deviation above the other(more if you consider everyone in the population you're measuring). Now, you can see that to have influence, you have to be at the very right. For Jews, this is far more likely than nonJews.

Additionally, you can see that this is not some grand Jewish conspiracy given that the Orthodox Christian income distribution is extremely close to that of Jews. http://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/income-distribution/

&gt; oh wait, outliers can't be used to discredit overwhelming mounds of data?

How are these outliers? You can find Jews at every forefront of science. Take the most influential individuals who've contributed to Anarcho-Capitalist thought, and see the immense number of Jews.

&gt; LMFAO, this is coming from the guy who accused me of appealing to authority, I'm legit laughing over here.

More of an appeal for you to actually use science to debate me. But your arguments are all hollow and based on emotion - an irrational dedication to some wacky belief.

&gt; You're brain dead when it comes to admitting the reality of Jewish ethnocentrism and their propensity to push anti civilizational ideas and movements, more evidence will not sway that

To be able to make that statement, you'd need heaps of evidence, evidence which both of us know you don't have. You cherry pick every single thing and then beat your chest like you've discovered fire. Seriously, man?

If there are confounds which you cannot explain, and there are thousands, then you've stumbled upon a lack of causality.

Your immense emotional response is due to this absence of actual evidence.

Personally, I don't give a shit one way or another, but your Jewish conspiracy is no different from the alt-left's White Male one.

And yes, I do more or less agree with your finalized bold statement. People are demoralized. Effective workers are exploited. The rest of society rests on the efforts of very few people(many of who are....Jews).

Morals are necessary for a functional society that isn't a disgusting imitation of Sim City. If people were to interact and depend on one another within strict moral frameworks, we wouldn't need the massive state.",1504224527

The idea that Q is Q requires logic is a fascinating idea. I agree, at some level, you cant know Q is Q unless you think it. Of course, that's only because you call Q Q.

He was getting his ass whopped by Mayweather and was lucky the ref saved him otherwise McGregor was going out on his back KO'd with Floyd bouncing his head off the canvas with that straight right that he was landing all night.

I guess the best you can do is try not to let emotion get the best of you. Right now you're browsing Reddit and likely not being judged by others. It's easy to say to yourself ""Don't care what others think"" when you're not the centre of attention.

As soon as you're in a situation when others might be judging you, emotion takes over and your sense of logic flies out the window. That's when you need to catch yourself and force yourself to keep thinking logically. It's easier said than done but you can get better with practice.

The one thing that works for me is keeping in mind that just about everyone around who seems confident is actually feeling insecure on the inside and hiding it.",1504224528

All you have is his main character and average attack, and this should be enough. You can guess that team with low average attack is SP team, and other teams are attack teams, but that is all.

We definitely chat about weight loss in the mornings as we all weigh in and catch up on our goals for the day, our struggles from the week, our recipes, our workouts, etc. 

As you noticed, the conversational topics do change at times. But please know you are always welcome to come discuss weight loss, get support and motivation, ask questions, and share your experiences! We'd be delighted to talk about all those things.

Regarding dogs: obviously I'm a believer.  But, it is work and I really hope you go into the endeavor being prepared to not only provide for the dog while you serve, but also after.  In other words, bring the pup home.  If you treat your dog right while you serve and then leave it, you're setting the dog up for an early demise, because it'll trust when it shouldn't otherwise.

 How do u deal with very over weight individuals who come in with serious health

 issues due to being overweight? I assume u can't tell a poor person to go to

 the gym, and I'm sure it's difficult for them to eat better fresher foods since

 they cost more.  When I worked at these kinds of hospitals ide find the dr

 would either not mention weight and just treat the immediate symptoms, or jus

 say ""try to lose some weight, etc"" and not go into details

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","If your parents are okay with letting you stay for a little while, and the situation in general is ok (adult children living with parents can sometimes get...complicated), then stay there.  Maybe offer them a couple hundred in rent.  

First save up about $1-2k for a small emergency fund.  This needs to be in an account separate from your checking, otherwise it'll just get spent.  You should be able to get that together in the first month or so.  

Then, you're going to start throwing nearly every dollar you make at paying off these loans.  Start by paying the minimum on the student loans and attacking the credit cards. Once the credit cards are paid off, attach the student loans. If you do this, you'll be completely done with both in a little over a year.  If you don't, if you just start spending this money on whatever instead of debt, you'll be ""normal"" like everyone else, and have student loans following you around for a decade or more.  Don't be normal, be awesome, and pay it off!

Once it's paid, save up about $5-$10k, and then thank your parents for letting you stay all this time, and move out.  

You get rid of this debt early in life, and build good savings habits (You don't have to be a monk, just careful with your money), and you can become quite wealthy.  You do what everyone else does (get that first job and immediately buy a new car with debt, pay only the minimums on credit cards and student loans, rent a fancy apartment that maxes out their budget, etc), and you won't.

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","A good answer is [supplied in our FAQs](https://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1ijyd4/faq_question_what_are_the_differences_between/).

The short of it is this. In other tunings (Just Intonation, Pythagorean, etc) the distance between each step is different whereas in 12-TET (aka 12-EDO) the distances are the same. This is important when it comes to modulations, when you change keys.

If you construct your JI tuning starting with C then the dominant (G) will be a ratio of 3/2. But if you change keys all of a sudden the ratio between the new tonic and the new dominant will no longer be 3/2 but some other ratio that's slightly off. And this goes for all the other intervals.

Here's an analogy. In equal distance tuning (greatly simplified) you might have these interval values:

A = 1  
B = 2  
C = 3  
D = 4

The distance between A and C (2) is the same as the distance between B and D (2).

But here's what a JI tuning (by analogy) would look like:

A = 1  
B = 2.1  
C = 3  
D = 3.9  

The distance between A and C is still 2 but the distance between B and D is 1.8. That's what happens when you change keys when using a non-equal distance tuning.

What this means it that 12-EDO is best for keeping the distances between intervals exactly the same regardless of what key you start in and what key you change to.

So the short of it is that 12-EDO works so well in Western music that changes keys. If your piece never changes key then you might find that a JI tuning gives better sounding results, most noticeably the thirds (which are off by about 14 cents -- humans can hear a difference of 3-5 cents).

My favourite video game commercial would have to be this [Fire Emblem commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM-s5C0dnZs&amp;ab_channel=XenoGear). Such a stupid commercial that had no relevance to the game, but it spawned some solid memes, so all is good. ",1504224538

1. I am unsure about the future of software engineering and if I would be able to successfully secure a job after the completion of the program. 

2. I live a good 150 kilometres from the University of Waterloo—where software engineering seems to be a great option, the co-op program is excellent, and is very competitive. I do not know if I would be able to sustain myself for weeks on end and transportation will certainly be a hassle. 

3. I am worried about not being accepted into Waterloo since an elder friend of mine was rejected for software engineering with a 96 average on his top six. 

4. I am also considering applying to computer science—which supposedly specialises into software engineering in the later years (please need confirmation)—at University of Toronto Scarborough campus however many people say the co-op placement is mediocre. 

5. Applying to computer engineering at University of Toronto St. George Campus is also troublesome since they do not apparently have co-op for this program and I want to explore more of the software aspects than hardware.

BUT, find yourself a focus distance calculator or hyperfocal calculator app for your phone. Set the aperature and focus ring and forget about it. The idea is that everything a certain distance and further will always be in focus. The problem is you may need to stop down a bit to get it there. 

edit: for example, if you set it to f4, and the focus ring to 6.5, everything from 4' to 23' should be in focus according to my app. It may take a little tweaking because the focus ring on mine isnt exact. Im on a 60D so yours may be different.

So for instance if you have 3 screens this weekend for The Hitman's Bodyguard and it makes $10M this weekend, you increase your total by $30M. You also get bonuses for including the film that has the best value per price, and a big bonus if you guess the perfect combo for that week. The key is to pick the films you think are at the best value. The most expensive films are the ones expected to make the most that weekend and vice versa. Some times films are very undervalued or overvalued. It all depends on timing and knowing the market. ",1504224540

Saw her perform a live voice ""show"" in NYC.  I hate her for that alone.

Still, he manages to stay balanced. Watch it here
