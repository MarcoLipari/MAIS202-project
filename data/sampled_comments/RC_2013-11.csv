"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Do you really think he chooses what prayers to answer and which not?

God does not always gets what he wants (example Adam and Eve, Satan, etc, read the answer to the question bellow for more information).


 If so, why is medicine necessary then, if the result of a sickness was result of God's will, and if he did not intervene, why do you thank him for something he did not do? 

You seem to have a misconception that God always gets what he wants. The bible mentions jealousy, that he wants everyone to follow him. However, God also want people to make a choice. Can God truly get both? It does not work that way. Could God had made it work that way, I think no because THAT WOULDN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. ""sickness was result of God's will"", sickness is not a result of God's will in the first place. Because we live in a 'fallen world'. The world fell when Adam and Eve sinned making God unable to be in their presence without sacrifice or Jesus. This implies that God does not always get his way. And personally, I think god wants every one of to be healed, but he just can't.


Why does he only gives opportunities, love, and pleasure to those with opportunities, but not to those who have no chance of having what they want to have but no opportunism to get it?

Please rephrase this question if you want me to give my best bet at answering it correctly. I don't understand what you are asking.


 If he does not answer prayers, why pray then?
He answer some prayers. The action of praying, in my opinion, is to help strengthen your faith, and sometimes, regardless to the strength of your faith, God will deliver.



 Why does God act like an invisible God where we need him and there is no chance we can have what we want?


There seems to be a stigmatism to restrictions in the bible to mean ""we don't get what we want"". For instance the bible sais not to have sex before marriage, and we all know the issues if you do. There is now a child in this world that requires a person's attention when they don't have another person to help care for the child.


God chooses to be an invisible God because he wants his followers to have faith in him. He wants to give people a choice, so they can follow him or follow this world. I am not saying that this world is a terrible place I know tons of great atheists, but regardless, he wants people to choose. If there was constant miracles all the time there would be no basis for discovery or any drive to create great things. If he made a building every time someone needed a house, how could he sit back and enjoy his creation? People would have no basis on what they can and can't do.



 Why when we are full of opportunities and its likely that we get what we want, he appears and blesses us? 


I think someone else should answer this question. I have no clue.


Don't take my word at face value, research it for yourself. I do not have all of the answers.

You definitely don't have to post a picture if you don't want to. What size are you wearing now? How does the bra fit? 

* Does the gore (middle part that connects the two cups) sit firmly between your breasts? Not on your boobs or not touching anything at all.

* If you gently pull your breasts forward and up, are they still all covered by the cups, or do they bulge out? [Scoop and swoop](http://brasandbodyimage.com/2012/09/05/putting-your-bra-on-properly/)

* Does your band ride up your back? It is supposed to be snug to provide most of the support.

* Do the wires fully circle your breasts ? Not sitting on them at all?

* Do you maybe have an idea of what kind of [shape](http://www.reddit.com/r/ABraThatFits/wiki/shape_guide) you are?

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I think it's ridiculous because, well, simply because it's extra-Biblical. It's so far removed from sex, the argument that it will inevitably lead to sex seems absurd to me. I believe that God is pleased when I kiss my girlfriend, in the same way that He is pleased when I tell her I love her, or when I give her a gift, or do something nice for her. All are signs of love and affection, and God likes those things.

I agree what you're saying about middle ground. What I'm saying is that the ""for Christ"" route is rarely an extreme. It's usually a matter of not falling into a ditch on either side of the road. Our pastor was telling us about a religious group that decided that all sex was bad, so they separated husbands and wives and laid flour on the floor between their rooms at night and, well, they died out. On the other extreme, there's the free love movement. Neither one are good. The righteous path is usually somewhere in the middle. (Matt 7:13-14)

And as far as lust, yes, I totally agree. Totally. That's why I don't even have any questions about porn being bad. But, in this case, I honestly believe the desires I have for my girlfriend are out of love, not lust. Lust is self seeking, love seeks out to bless others. My desires are to please her, not necessarily myself (although I certainly do know that I would be pleased myself in most- if not all- of those actions). So I don't think I'm lusting after my girlfriend.","1383264000"

1) Well, there was no sex involved - just bondage.

2) There are _many_ different types of restraints available to the - ahem -medical professional:

  A) The traditional leather restraint - now falling out of favor, since
     leather is damn hard to clean, and does not conform to OSHA standards for blood-borne pathogens.

  B) The new hard plastic restraints, same design as the leather one, but
     easier to clean. Every time I see them, brings a nostalgic tear to my
     eye. Gone are the days when one could say: ""I think he/she/it needs 
     the _leathers_.""

  C) A pre-packaged, single-use restraint, which is made of foam-padding, and
     skimpy-looking straps. 

ObAside: I once applied this type of restraint on a person who had just
taken PCP. During the ride up to the hospital, I kept whispering in his
ear that he had killed his entire family. Since he was rather disoriented,
and probably couldn't see straight, _and_ was restrained, I figured he
would be no problem.

We arrived at the hospital, wheeled the patient into the ER lobby. He was
still restrained to the stretcher. He came to, and the ten minute 'whisper'
session I had with him finally connected. With a roar, he rocked back-n-
forth, until the stretcher tipped-over, he got to his feet - _with the
stretcher still tied to him_, and ran out of the ER and down the street.
He then noticed the flimsy restraints on his arms, and snapped them off with
a shrug. The stretcher fell away from him, and with another load roar, he
ran away, howling into the night.

""He's getting away! Somebody do something!"" said a nurse.

""Listen, if you think I'm going after him - you're crazy."" said my partner.

""Don't look at me - you're just lucky he didn't think you were a bottle of
soda - with a twist-off top.""

3) Still trying to take some pixs at calls - give me some time.

There was a time when posts were rewarded or demoted based on these little arrows that exist right next to both submissions and comments.  Now, up/downvotes pretty much seem like curated junk.  Something can only be popular if the grand poobah of the sidebar decides if it is worthy enough to bless HIS page with it's very existence.

My opinion is that there was a time when mods were accountable.  Moderating was not a decision making process that was cast down from the powers on high, but more of a mutual conversation.... where when a mod really abused power, the community backlashed and these guys were specifically called out.

Perhaps it is a necessary evolution, as I am sure all the whackjobs in the universe come crawling out during ""accountability"" time and the immense growth has increased the number and frequency of stabby sorts of comments.  But I do think it is unfortunate for Reddit.

And I know, I know.... I could go make my own subreddit or try and be a moderator, but why?  I am sure the job sucks.  When the time comes, I will just get my information and discussion elsewhere.  I have really liked Reddit over the years, but at some point I am sure I will lay it to rest.","1383264005"

After bearing witness to countless acts along the cheating spectrum, you need to pick your battles, but stay persistent in letting your friend(s) know that you don't approve of their actions.  If you're really friends, they should at least be willing to listen to you.  If they are unwilling, they're just people you hang out with.  Very infrequently, however, will a situation ever arise in which you are justified in betraying your friend for their SO.  This appears to be a good case in which you should just back off.  Maybe you should suggest that he end things with his ""gf"" if he's going to go for other girls, but maybe this will all blow up in his face anyway.  If he's not really in a relationship, then she may be just as free to act as he is.  The point is that it is always important to act only when sufficient evidence warrants your involvement.  I applaud your desire to intervene - it's hard to (at first) call your friends on their bullshit.  Friends do that, though - they try to make the other better people.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","The honeymoon period is over,  
Understandably there are people from the beta who want the old content flow to continue, but Dota2 has been in production for 2 years? now  
their staff are encouraged to work on projects they want to work on, and theyve potentially lost a few staff members now that dota2 looks this good.
also I assume there are others who want to jump on the beta bandwagon and yell and scream; expecting their involvement to make a difference in how much content valve release.  
But we need to understand ROI (Return on Investment) for valve, Valve have spent many years pumping out features for what we know and love to be Dota 2, and there is already so much content that Dota 2 can now stand on its own as a game.  
its polished, stable and has a large number of heros, It's certainly not parity, but Im sure valve can afford to stop pumping out huge changes, because their time is best spent penetrating other markets (the console market)  
additionally I wouldnt be supprised if they are storing all that unreleased Dota1 content to support their new update type, of slow and big updates  

Overall valve is a small company, and they thrive from being one, they will not dedicate a team to Dota2 if resources and staff Will-Power isnt in their favour","1383264008"

I also thought I would never go Greek, but I at least rushed TBS and it was great getting to know all the girls there.

Johnny will take out Zuko very easily as he absorbs flames.

Sue takes out Aang with a force bubble in his throat just to knock him out.

Ben fights Katara and no amount of water bending can hurt his rocky exterior as it is wayyyy too tough.

Reed leapes and glides in the air so Toph can't 'see' him and he gets too close to her and disables her.

Now for the flip side.

Toph might be able to bend Ben because... rock guy, duh.

Zuko takes on Reed because it don't matter how bendy you are when people can burn you.

Katara takes on Sue with blood bending but if not she could just freeze her in ice. Plus Katara is quick enough and clever to fight Sue.

Aang has taken out the Firelord with Zouzen's Comet with avatar state so a Human torch should be not so hard even without the Avatar state.

All in all these are the best case even scenarios when you try to balance them... maybe use Movie/Cartoon versions of the FF and disable the Avatar state.

Well to do or successful men are avoid marriage like the plague due to massively unfair divorce &amp; child custody laws and judicial decsions going the womans way 80% of the time despite the fact 65-90% of ""No Fault"" divorces are started by women. To the tune that 38% of men under 30 don't see marriage, family, or children as an important step on lifes road and this number is increasing. On the flip side woman are wanting to marry in an increasing numbers but if they are successful they refuse to marry down, 

**TL;DR** Women are taught to have unrealistic expectations and men are no longer interested in dealing with asshole women.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The idea of making Seals, Marks, and Glyphs have unique functions is great, but
if you are maintaining tier rune structure do not make it about powerlevel.
Lower tier runes should be less flexible, higher tier runes should be more flexible.    



Imagine if T1 runes took up 9 rune slots on a page?  
And if T2 runes took up 3 runes slots?  
T3 runes could be the same and have up to 9 on a page.  


 
* T1 Armor Seal x1 = 13 Armor = 1200 IP Total  
* T2 Armor Seal x3 = 13 Armor = 1400 IP Total  
* T3 Armor Seal x9 = 13 Armor = 1845 IP Total  



TIER 1 RUNES WOULD HAVE MINIMUM FLEXIBILITY, AND BE VERY SIMPLE.   
Tier 2 would be slightly more flexible.  
Tier 3 would be the most flexible.   



Pricing should lean toward accessibility for newer players.   
Less flexibility cheaper price.   
Simpler customization for lowbies with more flexibility for more advanced user who take the time to farm up to have a particular set up.  



Unlock runes slots as you level up should be adjusted to accomodate the change in slot occupation. Maybe the technology for that would be to difficult to develope before Season 4 starts, but it should not severly impact competative play and only make it more accessible to new users, while still encouraging more rune purchases.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; I think people who've earned what they have, or else have taken it from a state of nature by their own effort, have a right to keep what they've thereby earned.

So this is your distributive principle. The words ""aggression"" and ""coercion"" mean nothing for your theory actually. Right? Because if this principle wrong, then what you currently call defense, would actually be aggression, correct?

My point here is talking about aggression and coercion when we have differing theories of entitlement literally does nothing. It's basically a 100% waste of time. Right? Because those words only get their meaning derivatively from a theory of entitlement.

ALL economic philosophies in the history of the existence of the world believes in the NAP. Every one of them. They believe it is wrong to use violence that is inconsistent (aggression) with their theory of what belongs to who. And they believe is correct (defense) to use violence that is consistent with it.

But there is one theory in the history of the world whose adherents literally think that you can prove who is entitled to what by appealing to NAP. That's what's so amazing.

You go: I believe X is entitled Y because of the NAP. And then I go, but why is taking Y a violation of the NAP. Well because X is entitled to it! HAHAHAHA. You justify your theory of entitlement by appealing to NAP, and then justify your definition of NAP by appealing to your theory of entitlements. It's fantastically circular.

So all I am asking is this. Will you agree -- when someone disputes your theory of entitlement -- to never ever ever say the word aggression in the context of that debate? Because you realize it literally does nothing in the debate at all. It says ""I think X is entitled to Y because I think X is entitled to Y.""","1383264016"

"longboarding","t5_2qvgw","Hey guys!

I've been running Indy 169 Stage 10's with 65mm Cult Convertors on my Comet Shred 32 for the past couple of months. I weigh 65kg (140ish lb).

I've been using it heavily for commuting, but also for some low to moderate speed skids.

I'm running them on Bones Hardcore Mediums, with 1/8"" Shock Pads. I was running them with a washer boardside, but that changed the geometry, and began to deform the bushings. After having taken out all washers (now just using the bones inserts) the trucks have been completely unlocked.

I used stock Indy bushings for about 2 hours. As anyone who's seen Indy bushings will know, they aren't exactly precision items.
The bottom of my bushings (there is a VERY clear bottom to each Indy bushing) looks like it was cut before the urethane was set. There are cracks and folds. It has a very inconsistent surface.

If you're looking into buying Indy's, I'd absolutely recommend a full bushing upgrade. I'd personally reccomend Bones Hardcore (For &lt;120lb, Medium for 120-160, Hard for &gt;160).
Having said that, I've heard great things about Khiro and Reflex's street bushings. (Riptide also has a street bushing series, which I'd love to hear about if anyone has had any experience)

As with any other TKPs these bushings are inherently less stable at speed than RKPs. The tighter you run the bushings, the more 'stability' you're going to have. On my Bones Double Cones, I'd not be comfortable running these much faster than 20mph, but that's just my comfort zone, and more capable riders could absolutely run them faster I'm sure. The first Indys were designed with the intention of being the first downhill skateboarding trucks, I believe.

I noticed the instability a lot more when bumboarding. Even at around 10mph, I was having difficulty managing the wobbles. Remembering that these trucks are narrower too than standard longboard trucks.

Do they turn sharply? Hellz yeah they do. Indys dive for DAYZ. Later on into the turn is where Indys really shine. They're a fantastic feeling truck for commuting.

The bushing seat is a little bit restrictive and snug on the boardside, but is quite open on the roadside. I'm used to describing RKP bushing seats, so I'm a little at a loss for words here. Someone will be able to do a better job.

Indys are the kings of durability for the cost IMO. Remembering that street skaters thrash these trucks to pieces should say enough about their durability. They're tough mother fuckers. I'll happily drop large curbs without a second thought, which is a lot more than can be said about many popular RKPs.

I have raw finished trucks, so, no, the paint hasn't come off. The hangar has scratch marks, but that's all part of the game.

On the whole these trucks have been absolutely fantastic for me. I was running surfrodz on my shred before I found these, and they'd slip out far too easily, due to the inappropriate hangar size for the board (177mm).

I have so much more control. Highly recommended.

EDIT: It's worth mentioning that these trucks are insanely low. They feel like half the height of Cal 50s when pushing. I also get no wheel bite, but that's mostly due to a combination of Comet's perfectly placed sanded wells, the 1/8"" risers, and that my trucks are not very loose. Having said that, I'd feel uncomfortable riding them much looser.","1383264018"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","It should be noted that I've upvoted every single person who's disagreed with me here, as far as I know. That said.

In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they'd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother's boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He's not particularly successful as an engineer, but I've met lots of other engineers who aren't as good as me at physics, so I'm guessing that's not just a result of him being bad at it. I'm also pretty good at engineering. I don't have a degree, and other than physics I don't have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I've come across. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.

I'm a good enough writer that I'm writing a book and so far everybody who's read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that's not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I've heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.

I don't know if that will suffice as evidence that I'm intelligent. I'm done with it, though, because I'd rather defend my maturity, since it's what you've spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn't just faking it, I'd even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self's actions, it shouldn't be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.

I don't believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren't harming others. I don't have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don't care what a person's fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don't have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that's not really an impressive moral, but it's unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things. I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile, piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I'm pretty much a pacifist. I've taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I'll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don't attack, I'll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don't fight back. I've therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I'm never in a situation where I'll be worse off after a fight. If I'm not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don't care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I'll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I'd prefer to do that over killing them. I consider myself a feminist. I don't believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it'll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit ""women are crazy"" circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don't think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren't awesome.

That doesn't mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don't believe it's fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything's OK when it's really not (and that's a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I'm kind of tired of citing these examples and I'm guessing you're getting tired of reading them, if you've even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I'm pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments). And, uh, I'm a pretty good moderator.

All that, and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think, now that you at least slightly know me? ","1383264029"

very well put lol. I didnt wanna watch the video so I looked through comments and this sums up the situation very nicely. Fukushima is very serious. I live in the northwest of America and I honestly don't feel safe. I can't even believe people inhabit Japan still. They are in denial and also the ones who are smart and have the means to speak out to large numbers are being kept quiet. If this happened in America (which it very easily could) of course our government would do the same. After Fukushima happened the EPA raised the safe levels of radiation people can be exposed to. So pretty much they will just tell us we are safe and remain calm no matter how many people die. thats pretty much what i think is going on in japan.","1383264033"

: Hey, Tae, got any good concussion-cum-intoxication stories?

You know, Charles, I was just gonna post this:

Working the Fourth of July was hell - but at time-and-a-half who cares?

My overnight shift consisted mainly of driving around, drinking coffee,
and smoking cigarettes - and chasing after the occasional city punks that
shoot bottle-rockets at the ambulance. One rocket actually zipped in one
window, and out the other, to explode several yards away. Got me startled,
that one. Caused me to spill my HOT coffee on my lap. Bastard got away, too.

Around 2 am, we received a call for an 'MVA - sort of.' The quirkiness of 
the dispatcher that night notwithstanding, the call description was rather
vague, and our attempts to get an update while enroute were answered with:

""Paramedic 11, the police are on scene - they're screaming for you.""

Cops usually scream for you only when they encounter HEAVY trauma, or one
of their guys is injured, so we 'stepped it up,' flying down side-streets
the wrong way [which, incidentally is a good way to kill homeless people,
not that I ever did] and 'sliding' through red traffic lights. We passed
by a bar - some of the patrons had spilled out onto the street, and they
cheered our passing-by with raised glasses. I saluted them one finger.
A few minutes later, we arrived on scene to find our patient.

Apparently, one female Fourth of July reveler had WAY too much to drink.
One of her friends, being the kind soul he was [and pretty ripped himself],
offered to drive her home. On the way home, she climbed out of the 
passenger-side door, and stood on the car window ledge. All was well: she
was waving her arm, yelling ""Happy Fourth!,"" - until her friend drove a
little too close to a telephone pole, and her forehead caught the end of
a lineman's spike. The tip of the spike penetrated the skin on her forehead,
but because her head also snapped back at the same time, it _pulled_ her
skin back, over her head to about mid-scalp.

When we got to the patient, she was quite agitated, screaming:

""WHAT THE FUCK! I CAN'T FUCKING SEE! HELP ME! I CAN'T FUCKING SEE!""

And so on.

The cops and firefighters looked quite pale - there was a large pool of 
blood at this woman's feet. I thought it was the bleeding that obscured her
vision. I was wrong. Since she'd basically been scalped, the the tissue
that consisted of her nose, cheeks, and mouth no longer had anything 
holding it up. So the tissue slid down, moving her eyelids to about cheek-
level, blocking her eyes.

I walked up to her, and with gloved hand, grabbed a little lower scalp
tissue, and pulled UP. Viola - she could see! I had to be careful, though,
since if I pulled up too much, her cheek tissue would move up to eyeball-
level, blinding her - and giving her a toothy, feral grin.

After placing a large dressing on her scalp, and instructing her on how to
hold her own face up, we strapped onto a wooden board, and transported
her to the hospital. No cervical injuries.

At the hospital, her blood alcohol level was .450! Fifty more points, and
she qualified for an endotracheal tube. Two surgical residents were called
down to suture her scalp closed. It took them three hours and over two 
hundred sutures to close her wound. Every so often, she would wake up while
they were suturing, and yell:

""Hey - who turned out the lights!""

One resident or the other would lift her face up, she would open her eyes,
look around, and fall back asleep.

I don't think they used anesthesia.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","May I ask you something? I'm not trying to be racist, I'll just write it down the way I think it is.

I'm living in Germany (an area where many Turks are living). While I really don't enjoy their company, many of them are really friendly and often brighten the mood (yes, we Germans can be very... depressing). Still, many Turks just behave differently than the rest. 

Maybe it's just me, maybe it's just that I grew up in a family that had the term ""indoor voice"". Anyway, I just don't understand how I can react to their temper. 

See, I don't know how I should talk to your people. Should I be polite? Because then some of them might try to act like a big king and make fun of me. Should I be rude? That wouldn't be very nice and I don't like that. Or should I be neutral? But what is neutral? I'm just afraid of saying something that might offend anyone and end up being racist.

I might have this fear because some guys here vandalize stuff and just act like total dicks. They show no respect at all. What should I do? I mean, if they were German then I'd probably ask them if they wanna look like ""them"". But I can't go to a Turk and say ""you wanna look like one of those asshole Turks?""

I know that it's the same problem everywhere. Germans act like shit, too (don't get me started about their behavior abroad!). I'm not writing this to criticize or offend you/anyone else. I just need advise. Thanks for reading!","1383264038"

Even supposedly with no smoothing, it smoothed, and lagged somewhat, even with a pencil tool. I'm sure it's because of the virtual machine, and in Boot Camp (stand-alone Windows) it would be much better, but I hate to reboot the computer just to draw for half an hour. Also, I use a Mac for a reason; it appeals to my sense of design and absence of clutter, which I don't experience in Windows.

This sense of lack of complexity and clutter has even made me abandon the Mac, which I switch on hardly ever anymore. The iPad is so much more friendly and goes out of my way, so I can do what I want, instead of figuring out how to operate the computer.

Going back to Windows for me would be like driving a truck, while I rather drive a bike (iPad), even more than a car (Mac). It's about avoiding friction and not wanting to put up with unnecessary barriers caused by design decisions, put in place almost 30 years ago (1984, launch of the Mac), barriers between you and what you want to accomplish. Old ideas that no longer work. A personal computer is best suited for text input, not so good for other tasks, like drawing.

There are three cymbals. I also have a wireless keyboard that almost exactly the same thing happened too (a surface-mounted component came off), if you could do that as well, it would be great.

Its possible that something/someone else has already found us (maybe other humans, but much further along the tech tree) and they decided its better to stay in an observant role, like how we would observe animals in nature without interrupting what they do. 

Imagine all the advancement we've achieved the last 100 years. Now add 100 more, then 1,000 more, then 1,000,000 more years. We're only 10,000 years old as a species. We know so little :'(","1383264049"

If you seem him half up like that, he's going to do the horizontal laser, which is your sign to get right up next to him. If you're standing right next to him the laser will go over you and you can spend that whole time whacking him uninterrupted.

As for the straight laser, just try to never be right in front of him. I prefer to attack from the side or behind, but as a gunlance, I never have to worry about dodging hip checks.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","A morality based upon perfect rationality expects it but doesn't damn you for not being perfectly rational all the time. It's a constant end to be striving towards. The only evil is to ignore the cultivation of that faculty or to willingly disregard your capacity to be reasonable. 

&gt;No matter how much I think people should be rational, they're going to remain irrational, and if I want to get anything done, I need to anticipate that.

That's what a man being an expert over himself has to do with it. You start off assuming that someone won't be reasonable and treat them as such, rather than assuming that they should and can be reasonable and treat them as such. Treating them with *dignity*, which brings me to my next point...

Dignity does not vary wildly in that it is a term that denotes an inherent respect for the dignified agent. You should respect your fellow man enough to give him the benefit of the doubt that he will appeal to reason in your dealings. That doesn't mean you blind yourself to the reality that not all men will be reasonable--but you should treat your fellow man with the same dignity and respect you would demand from him towards yourself--and if you're reasonable enough to go making claims like this that have any value, and we're to take you as a respectable dignified rational agent, why is it that you start off presuming someone else is not similarly so?","1383264053"

Absolutely smoking blonde bartender at a karaoke bar downtown.  Objective 8 for sure, 9 to many.  Well, the second or third time I was in there, we were chatting - I'd pulled her up on stage for a duet earlier in the night - and she began professing her love of anime.

Well, in my younger days, I was quite the *otaku* myself.  So we talked for a while, and she kept leaning in, playing with her hair, reaching out to touch me - all great body language, obviously.

Long story sort, she practically threw her phone number at me.  And here's the sucky part: I couldn't do anything about it.  Her husband of *less than a year* is a bouncer at the same bar.  **And he was working that night.**  If I'd taken her home, there would be absolutely no way for me to ever set foot in that bar again.  Ultimate cockblock, right there.

TL;DR: I chose my favorite karaoke spot over the chance to score with one of the hottest blondes I've met.","1383264055"

"toronto","t5_2qi63","There's nothing hypocritical about what I said. I never said I could do a better job as mayor. In fact I don't think I should be mayor, and that has nothing to do with how much weed I smoke. My issue with Ford being the mayor of Toronto isn't really related to drug laws in any sense, for what it's worth I think marijuana should be at the very least decriminalized, if not legalized and regulated in the same manner as alcohol and tobacco. Again though, that's beyond the point.

&gt;I'm not washing my hands of Ford because he smoked crack. I'm washing my hands of him because he got caught in a lie.

At the end of the day I think it all goes back to the type of character you're asked to put your trust and faith in. And the issue isn't specific to the fact that he smoked crack. If it was meth he was smoking, I'd feel the same way. If he was running an underground pitbull fighting league, I'd feel the same way. If he was cheating on his wife, I'd feel the same way.

It's a basic principle that beyond paramedics, doctors, police, and firefighters, the mayor might be the single most important job in the entire city of Toronto. The person making those decisions effect my everyday life, and those decisions have ramifications on future generations. Is it too much to ask of that person to be completely infallible? Is it too much to expect that person to have a impeccable character? Is is too much to take pride in and have respect for the type of character that happens to be the prime representative of our city?

Edit: I also simply do not believe you about this not effecting his job performance. Do you honestly believe that after waking up to 35 reporters on his front lawn, and the Toronto police holding a 20 minute press conference covered live by about 5 different news channels, he just went about his day and put full focus into his duties as mayor?","1383264055"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I'm not here to say why I think things are this way, but I've noticed that there is sometimes a difference in how christianity is preached between churches. I was raised in Black American churches and now that I'm in college the majority of churches I find have a predominately Caucasian audience. 

I've noticed that in Black churches salvation and the suffering of believers is emphasized. Slavery is a big theme in these churches and suffering and salvation from it tend to be a big preaching point. While faith in God is huge, I've noticed it's usually faith through the suffering and praise in the salvation.

In primarily Caucasian churches I've noticed that Grace through Faith is emphasized. I hear about forgiveness and grace through suffering and salvation and evangelism in salvation.

Personally I think it's just two cultural aspects to the same message. If I had to say why they're different I'd would probably attribute it to the separation in standard of livings between the two races. People who have harder lives may want a message that they can relate to... the Hebrews and Job. While people who have been privileged with easier lives want  to hear about spreading their good fortune and make themselves more worthy and relate to Paul.","1383264058"

&gt;&gt;Tibetan Buddhist writings frequently state that many of the things we perceive in the world are in fact illusory, as illusory as echoes or mirages. In Twelve Examples of Illusion, Jan Westerhoff offers an engaging look at a dozen illusions--including magic tricks, dreams, rainbows, and reflections in a mirror--showing how these phenomena can give us insight into reality. For instance, he offers a fascinating discussion of optical illusions, such as the wheel of fire (the ""wheel"" seen when a torch is swung rapidly in a circle), discussing Tibetan explanations of this phenomenon as well as the findings of modern psychology, and significantly clarifying the idea that most phenomena--from chairs to trees--are similar illusions. The book uses a variety of crystal-clear examples drawn from a wide variety of fields, including contemporary philosophy and cognitive science, as well as the history of science, optics, artificial intelligence, geometry, economics, and literary theory. Throughout, Westerhoff makes both Buddhist philosophical ideas and the latest theories of mind and brain come alive for the general reader.","1383264061"

You see, a turtle is just that, and if OP doesn't go out and meet other people he could be missing out on the greatest thing to ever happen to him (no way right?).

The rate at which dollars will be redeemable for gold can still be regulated so as not to encourage deflation.  Why is having a system that imposes fiscal responsibility on our government a bad idea?  You do realize that the only reason Nixon got rid of the gold standard was because investors lost faith in the US's ability to pay back their debts?

"skeptic","t5_2qj8f","Let's look at the article: ""97% of terminal cancer patients have had a root canal."" What's the source of that statement? There are lots of similar statements: 93% of women with breast cancer had root canals, based on athree-year study of 300 breast cancer cases, but not source is given.

&gt; Dr. Jones claims that toxins from the bacteria in an infected tooth or jawbone are able to inhibit the proteins that suppress tumor development. 

But no study is cited.

&gt; Dr. Josef Issels reported that, in his 40 years of treating “terminal” cancer patients, 97 percent of his cancer patients had root canals.

So this is the apparent source of the headline. Dr. Issels has a [wikipedia page here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Issels), which mentions that he was charged with fraud and manslaughter for his promises of cancer cures and the subsequent deaths of his patients. He was convicted, according to the article, but it was overturned because he believed he could cure cancer. He was, however, wrong. Among his better known patients is the late [Bob Marley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Marley#Illness_and_death).
I'll leave it to redditors to make their own judgment on Dr. Issels's credibility.

&gt; More than 25 million root canals are performed every year in this country

""How Stuff works"" says there are 15 million performed annually, citing the American Association of Endodontists. [source](http://health.howstuffworks.com/wellness/oral-care/procedures/root-canal-procedure.htm) Either way, it's a lot. My wife has had two.

&gt; Weston A. Price: World’s Greatest Dentist

Okay, here's a claim. Not surprisingly, [Dr. Price has a wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weston_A_Price), too. He died in 1948, and most of his theories about infection did, too. Dr. Price advanced the 

&gt; theory of focal infection, which held that systemic conditions, including complexion, intestinal disorders, and anemia could be explained by infections in the mouth. 

Source: the wikipedia page. Continued research by others, however, showed that ""the research of Price and others suffered from technical limitations and questionable interpretations of results."" ""Compared to modern research, Price's studies lacked proper control groups, used excessive doses of bacteria, and had bacterial contamination during teeth extraction, leading to experimental biases.""

Same source; I've omitted footnotes.

World's greatest dentist? I'd like some verification of that.

&gt; finally one endodontist named George Meinig recognized the importance of Price’s work and sought to expose the truth.

Dr. Meinig is mentioned on the wikipedia page about [focal infections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Focal_infection_theory)

&gt; Drawing severe criticism in the 1930s, focal infection theory, whose popularity far outstripped evidence, was generally discarded in the 1940s amid overwhelming evidence of its general falsity, whereupon dental restorations and root canal therapy became again favored.

&gt; A European source places Meinig among three authors who, in the early 1990s, independently renewed concern about endodontic therapy promoting disease systemically.[45] Yet there remained a lack of carefully controlled studies, and no investigations had definitely established adverse systemic effects. *** Still, even by 2010, ""the potential association between systemic health and root canal therapy has been strongly disputed by dental governing bodies and there remains little evidence to substantiate the claims"".

My recommendation is that when you see articles such as this, you read the article with a search window open and look up the people who are quoted and look at the source of the claims, if any sources are given. If not sources, dive into your favorite search engine and check for yourself.

Best wishes.

In my experience most people in the lab have very little understanding of the best practices to keep a monoculture. I come from a micro background, but work in immunology now. I swear if these people don't have some sort of drug cocktail in their culture they can't manage to keep it uncontaminated.

That said, I would recommend you grow up some frozen stock, in fresh media that you have just prepared and autoclaved. Look up aseptic technique and carefully follow the rules. See if your frozen stock is contaminated. If it is, tell your PI. There are ways to rescue a strain from a mixed culture.

It was important for me to learn and to be honest, I didn't really miss out on anything.  

How much did you learn from your traditional US history class?  Did any of it matter?  Would you feel like you missed out if it was not taught, and instead you get taught about guys and gals you might not otherwise have heard of?

My school (early 90s) had a bit of a racial problem because I came from an area that was nationally recognized for racial segregation (we're much better now) and they started bussing black students from a low-income area to a school that was predominantly white students from a low-income area.

For one, expecting such a dramatic change in a mere 10-20 years I think is unrealistic. Even if the technology is ready by then, it will take even more time for people to adopt it. I think many people will be reluctant to use driverless cars that they have minimal control over (and that don't break driving laws where they would).

We also don't know what kind of regulatory environment will surround driverless cars, either. Will they be required by law to keep a certain distance from other cars, for example?

I can see driverless vehicles replacing transit service in many places, but I think they will do the most good in cities that aren't particularly well served by transit. I don't see it replacing transit in denser cities that are currently very well served. Driverless vehicles might become a huge hit in a city like Spokane, but they're never going to replace the Yamanote Line in Tokyo.

Regardless, I do think that driverless vehicles may be a catalyst for better urban and even suburban design with more walkable neighborhoods and fewer massive parking lots, which I think we can all agree is a very good thing.","1383264066"

Absotively correct. You _could_ actually wrap the amputated part in gauze
moistened with saline, but let's be serious for a moment: who the hell
keeps saline around? Very rarely are amputated parts less than a 1/4 inch
in length re-attached. It simply isn't worth the effort. And if the part is
mangled or really dirty - forget it.

ObAside: I was once called to a posh home in Wellesley, MA, for a report
of an 'amputation.' Upon arrival, I found a fourty-ish year-old women with
an ENORMOUS bandage covering her hand. The fire department said that they
recovered the amputated part, and had it on ice. I asked to look at the
part, and saw the tip of the woman's finger in a platic bag. Twasn't more
than, oh say, 1/8 inch in length.

""Uh ma'am, I hate to say this - but I doubt that they'll be able to re-attach
such a small piece back on.""

""But they've GOT TO - I'm a concert violinist!""

""Well, we'll take it with us - but no promises.""

After getting to the hospital, the surgeon took one look at this 'tip' and
said:

""Sorry - can't do anything with this,"" and promptly dumped the baggie into
the trash.

The grief-stricken woman stared straight ahead and said:

""I'll never play the violin again.""

Most of the staff made their excuses and left the room - unable to stifle
the urge to laugh.

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","Your load is what determines the current, not the source of boost converter.

Say your load (a constant current LED circuit) will take 2A at 32V. That's 2*32 = 64W of power. To deliver this power, the boost converter will provide the amperage it needs to power that load at 32V, the output voltage you set it to. So if your source is at 19.2V, it will need to push slightly more than 3.33A (since 64W / 19.2V = 3.33A). I say slightly more because there is always some inefficiency in the conversion.","1383264073"

Logan Paulsen is a good blocker and why he is in the game a lot. The reason why Cooley was so good was because he blocked and could catch too. Getting a TE that can do both is very rare.

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","Yeah, but his reason for quitting seemed to be the lame excuse seemed to be that EPC quit being as much of an old boys club as it used to be.

&gt;“I just can’t, in good faith, go forward with some of the actions that are being taken by some of the people on that executive policy committee,” said Swandel.

&gt;“I don’t want to get into specifics or get into individuals, I just take it back to the whole idea of loyalty and experience and there’s a great lack of that right now at EPC.”

&gt;Swandel said that while Katz did ask him to stay on EPC, he wasn’t willing to effect the change that Swandel was looking for.

&gt;“Somebody has to stand up, and take a stand and show some leadership, and maybe the mayor will pay attention,” said Swandel, adding he began thinking about leaving EPC when former Coun. Gord Steeves left in 2011.

&gt;“I’ve told him I’m not comfortable working with that group, he’s decided that he is comfortable working with that group and that’s fair game.

&gt;“Dysfunctional, broken, divided, it’s not good. People have to be a lot more patient, you can’t be out there overreacting to things, that’s where it’s at, and I think it’s only going to get worse.”

[UPDATE: Winnipeg councillor said it was his decision to leave ‘broken’ committee (Metro Winnipeg,  Bernice Pontanilla, Nov. 1, 2012)](http://metronews.ca/news/winnipeg/424651/mayor-sam-katz-shakes-up-epc/)

Justin Swandel has also voted a motion to legally review the fire hall audit, justifying himself thusly:

&gt;St. Norbert councillor Justin Swandel walked off the floor of council Wednesday, refusing to participate in the debate on a motion to hire outside legal counsel to review the audit of the fire hall scandal.

&gt;Swandel said the move was a publicity stunt that could expose all members of council to legal action.

&gt;Swandel was alone among council members who criticized the Ernst &amp; Young review, describing it as a politically-motivated attack on unnamed individuals.

&gt;""I’m going to leave the floor until this is done,"" Swandel said, and then he left the council chamber and didn’t return until after the motion had been debated.

 I had fell over in the bathroom and was just sitting there when 2 guys came in, closed the door behind them and were talking about things like ""Hey, remember that time we were talking about rape."" I yelled out my friends name and they both opened the door and instantly left.

Still to drunk to even get up, they came back later said something about ""snapchat"" and started taking photos of themselves in the mirror, so i hid my face, they left again. 

I decided to actually lock the bathroom that time, they tried coming in a bit later and were banging on the door, after they stopped i went outside with my friend because i thought being with him would be safer.

I told him what happened, he held my hands and hugged me and asked if i was okay and if anything happened, i said i didn't know and i was scared, so we left the party.

They could entertain each other. With the right ingenuity, you might be able to pull it off.

Without knowing how your yard is laid out, I'm willing to bet that it's not enclosed (hence why you said a dog door wouldn't work). 

&gt;No; sadly my rear yard is intersected by the rear-access road. That road is heavily used and cannot be blocked / impeded by anything. So I can't have a free-access doggie door for him/her to run in and out of. If I had a yard like that, I would install the fence and the doggy collar / doggy door system so that he/she could go in and out at leisure. This was why I opted for cats the last time.

My problem with this way of thinking is that the conclusion is decided first, and then any fact which would fit that story, regardless of the context, is scrambled together and presented as proof.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Elephantitis

I remember a call I went to where the patient was a mid-fifties male, found on the floor of his living room. He was quite unconscious - but that's not the story point. We found him on his stomach, and rolled him over, to discover: a set of testicles the size of cantalopes. All the males present (firefighters, police, landlord, me, my partner) immediately took a step back, drew in our collective breaths, and winced. Being simple men - with simple minds (where are they now) we assumed that his unconscious state had something to do with the HUGE twin-sacs he had.            
""Okay,"" I said, ""let's get him out of here. Could someone get me a..."" - I turned around and there was no one there. All the men had left! The patient's upstairs neighbor came in just then, saw her neighbor's super-Nerf ball (same color, too) gasped and ran away.

Finally, I was able to convince two burly firefighters to help me carry this guy out to the ambulance. But only after reassuring them that his condition wasn't contagious (I think). On the way to the hospital, I dug around by backpack (to find the Polaroid camera I usually carry with me at work) only to find that that it had no film - damn! Anyway we get to the hospital, and the doctor tells us it's ""elephantitis of the testicles.""

""Doc, even if I were an elephant, I'd be scared."" remarks my partner. The patient's relative arrives at the hospital, and we find out that he's had this condition for many years. ""He has a little (little?) sling that he puts it in and supports with a strap around his neck."" explains the relative.

Even though I _knew_ it wasn't contagious, I washed my hands for a looong time. All the way back to the base, my partner sat slumped over in the passenger seat - whispering ""the horror, the horror.""

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","When given a kinematic problem, remember the basic kinematic equations. See what you know in each equation and what you're solving for. If you have more unknowns then equations at your disposal, it might be unsolvable.

I only remember 3 basic kinematic equations, because others are derived from them:

x*_f_* = x*_0_* + v*_0_*\*t + 1/2at^(2)

v*_f_* = v*_i_* + at

x*_f_* = (v*_f_*^(2)-v*_i_*^(2))/(2a)

We're solving for time, so right off the bat we cannot use equation 3 since there's no time variable in it.

We cannot use equations 1 or 2 because we don't know initial velocity.

Uh-oh! At first glance this looks unsolvable. To solve for time, we need to know initial velocity! So let's see quickly if equation 3 can help us solve for initial velocity, and if it doesn't we'll have to resort to combining equations.

For equation 3, we're solving for initial velocity. We know displacement, acceleration, and final velocity. So we can solve for the initial velocity!

So if we solve for v*_0_* in the third equation, we get:

v*_i_*^(2) = v*_f_*^(2) - 2\*a\*x*_f_*

Plug in values:

v*_i_*^(2) = 32^(2)-2(3.6)(507)

Which gives us...

v*_i_*^(2) = -2626.4

Which would give an imaginary result. So clearly something is wrong. I assume you typed 507 on the keypad, and actually meant 5.7. In which case, if I am correct and resub:

v*_i_*^(2) = 32^(2)-2(3.6)(5.7)

Which yields about 31.35km/h for an initial velocity.

So now we can plug this in for equation 1 or even equation 2 to give us time.

32 = 31.35 + 3.6t

Solve for t and you get roughly 0.18 hours.

So finally, two notes:

1) As I mentioned, I only remember 3 equations because you can always derive the rest. If your teacher wants you to find an equation from a list, you'll have to follow the elimination process I described above and rework the problem.

2) You can skip a step once you know you'll need two unknowns, and that v*_i_* is the other one. Instead of solving for initial velocity first using equation 3, solve symbolically for initial velocity using equation 2, and then plug that into equation 1. That way, you'll have one equation, one unknown (the equation should be x*_f_* = x*_0_* + v*_f_*\*t - 1/2at^(2)). See if this is one of the equations given to you. As I said above, there's no need to memorize more than 3 equations - look how easy this was to derive!","1383264093"

&gt;In 2009, they found homes for eight of the 2,366 pets that came in their care. It is simply delusional to think that 2,358 pets showed up at their doorstep in an ""unadoptable"" state while 8 were adoptable. Even the absolute worst public shelters in the country can't top ratios like that. If an animal is truly in too much pain to go on, then absolutely they should be euthanized, but it is nothing short of delusional to think that there are 2,358 of these randomly showing up at PETA's door, and only 8 that are treatable.","1383264098"

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Isco is a better dribbler, more versatile, and a harder worker on the pitch. Özil is just a much better passer. But the difference between Özil and Isco is that with Real Madrid, someone like Özil is so invaluable because of his magnificent chance creation abilities. Someone like Isco is not the same fit that Özil is because he does not have the pass-first mentality. In a team of Cristiano and Bale, you need someone creative who will create opportunities on-the-ball, something that Bale and Cristiano cannot do consistently. Fatzema needs all the help he can get scoring goals, too.^1

The #10 role is perfect for Özil, but he just wasn't good enough in big matches. Isco is yet to prove his ability in big matches at Real Madrid, but as of right now I don't see him being a better fit. A better overall player, yes, but not for Real Madrid.

Rather, the mass and the energy are two properties of a single entity which are always present in the same proportion to each other.

But I am not a physicist either, and your argument does not depend in any important way on using the specific term ""energy"" for the underlying ultimate stuff. It is probably better to use the term ""substance,"" as you have suggested. Of course, we then need some description of substance. For example, we need to know what substance is if it's not composed of matter (in which case it would be a physical entity).","1383264100"

I had 2 options: Fuck her silly and see where it goes or get my fucking pride back publicly.

&gt;: Nah, the best part is that when a man is hanged properly, he ends up (heh)
&gt;: sporting a woody.  Hence the term, ""well hung.""

You know, I'm not sure that's true. If I remember correctly, to goal in
hanging is to place pressure against the cricothyroid membrane (Adam's
apple), to occlude or crush the trachea, causing asphyxiation, and after
a little dance, death. If a person were to 'sport wood' during a hanging,
that might be an indication that the hanged man fell with too much force,
causing the cervical spinal column to snap, in turn causing spinal cord
damage. Spinal cord damage at the cervical level would cause an erection,
otherwise known as 'priapism.' Damage to the third, fourth, and fifth
cervical vertebrae, with concommitant injury to the underlying spinal
cord, would cause the diaphragm to ctop working. This also would kill
a person by the mere fact that without the diaphragm to create a negative 
pressure in the chest, no air would go in. So, on many levels, I'm not
sure that 'sporting a chub' would be a sign of a lively, drawn-out
hanging.

If memory serves - I read once that the guys that did the actual hangings
had to practice a fair number of times before getting 'the hang of it.'

Sorry.

Anyway, if they didn't drop the man from a high enough height, the man
may fall to the ground, and be able to free himself. Also, if the man
did not fall with enough force to crush his larynx, he may struggle
enough that he could free himself - and by law, go free.

On the other hand, a fall with too much force would rip the head right off,
with the body to continue falling down.

deaths by hanging within a year's time. All of the victims were of
high school age, and the first two deaths were ruled 'accidental.'
This was because the first two kids were trying to masturbate while
asphixiating themselves. I responded to one of the calls that year.

Upon arrival, my partner and I walked up a flight of stairs to a
teenager's room. A male of about 13 - 15 years old, was hanging from
the ceiling. He had been dead for at least a couple of hours. The
physical signs? Incontinence of the bladder, a light-blue tinge to
his extremities - positive Smurf-sign, both orbits of his eyes were
bulging forward, his tongue was out - and quite blue. What was 
interesting to note was the distension of some of the large veins on
his forehead, and the petechiae over his face. Petechiae are small
reddish-spots that occur when capillaries burst under the skin -
usually due to a increase in pressure.

Several things of note:

There was a large hook that was screwed into the ceiling - the kind
used to hang potted p-lants and the like. This was used to hang the
rope.

The knot tied by this kid was a slip-knot of some sort. A little later,
when the ME came to get him, the knot came undone with a little tug.

This is the big one: his pants were down to his ankles, and so were his
briefs. I don't remember seeing any 'dew on the lily.'

Shortly after we got there, his mother came running up the stairs. She'd
been out shopping, and had just heard of it. She pushed us out of the
way, and when she saw the kid's body - with the pants and briefs down
to his ankles, the first thing she did was pull the pants back up, and
zipper them. She then turned to us and said:

""You know, he was under a lot of pressure ...""

The kid's death was listed as a 'suicide.'

Mothers.

They elected a tribune to build his own gang to kill him.) You constantly see riots, murders and arson taking place in this period. At one point the senate was on the verge of begging Pompey to bring troops in, just to restore order.

Greece, I have no idea on. But Rome certainly wasn't benefiting from a lack of police force. No more the they did a lack of a proper firefighting unit (the guys putting out the fires?

Blood rushed into her face as she bended down to retrieve the paper. Her hand phased through the page before her academic dress slipped off. Her breasts hung withered over her knees. Her skin was pallid, each vein looked as if it were to cut through the skin it was so thin.

Her hands skittered atop her dress which lay across the floor but she was unable to grasp it. The audience burst into laughter. The smiling man squatted down beside her. His forced smile never changing, his eyes unblinking. He quickly yanked the dress from the ground and marched off the side of the stage.

Paralyzed by shame the girl burst into tears. Her sobs drowned out by the audience's laughter.

She awoke seated among an audience dressed in gowns. Her memory in fragments she tried to regain her composure. A smiling man on stage called her name. A brief applause. The boy sitting beside her patted her on the back and motioned her to get up. She slowly walked down the aisle, each whisper in the crowd felt deafening.

Nervously the teenage girl ambled onto the stage..","1383264123"

In the same way companies incentivize early retirement to downsize their workforce when they don't have enough jobs to fill, keeping the retirement age low, even artificially, might prove more beneficial to the economy as a whole. Taxes would have to go up to pay the benefits, but employment would be less squeezed, so the government would theoretically be taking in more tax revenue.

The problem is, [classic economic theory](http://lauravanderkam.com/2012/05/lump-labor-fallacy/) and the accepted evidence doesn't support it. The UK government did [a long-term study](http://www.ifs.org.uk/wps/wp1002.pdf) on whether early retirement reduces labor supply and concluded:

&gt; Overall we find no evidence of long-term crowding-out of younger individuals
from the labor market by older workers. The evidence, according to a variety of methods, points always in the direction of an absence of such a relationship.

These two places were Catalonia/Aragon during the Spanish Civil War and The Makhnovists in Ukraine during the Russian Revolution. In both cases the fights the anarchists waged against the Bolsheviks and Fascists coincided with the creation of a free society. Both of these societies only collapsed due to extreme outside pressure. Nestor Makhno was outnumbered, outgunned, and then betrayed by the Bolsheviks. In Spain the Stalinists forcefully disbanded the communes and reinstated status quo ante bellum.

I used to work in the industry and it is pretty standard to start the presses once the series is won. If they win on a Thursday night, the contracted screenprinting shops across the country will run all through the night and the next couple of days.

Automatic screenprinting equipment runs at ~80/dozen shirts an hour and its not uncommon for shops to be running 4 presses at a time. That's 320 dozen shirts an hour, or ~30,000 shirts (in an 8-hour, overnight shift) ready to ship the morning after a clinching game. There will be some printed for the team in the event that they win, but that could literally happen the day of the clinching game.

Boston won, so multiple shops in Boston went into heavy production last night and had licensed, tagged shirts on sale throughout New England this morning.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I would love to do that.

But unfortunately, there aren't many foods that I like, and I live with my family, so I don't get to pick what foods I eat.

For instance, I recently told my mom that I want to eat healthier.  I told her to stop making macaroni and cheese or mashed potatoes for every side dish with dinner.  I suggested some plain fresh vegetables instead.  I don't like tomatoes or bell peppers, I don't like onions unless they're cooked down, I don't like cooked spinach, I don't like squash or brussel sprouts.  

So I tell her to just get some plain brocoli.  I'll eat that fresh with none of that nasty ranch dip, and no nothing.  Just plain and raw.  But my sister wanted it steamed.  So my mom cooks it.  But it tastes terrible to me!

It's so hard for me to eat right when my mom tries to form our meals around what the majority likes.  And that is fair, because it's just me who wants it this way.  I wish I liked all vegetables.  I would eat them all the time if I did, but for some reason I just don't.

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","Like you said, your initial momentum was 48400 N/s. You know the final mass (12000kg) and the final velocity (0.01 m/s).  I assume you mean velocity instead of acceleration, given your units.  So, delta p = p2 - p1, meaning 120 - 48400 =  -48280.  You lost a great deal of momentum, and the signs do matter.

Now, what is momentum?  Force multiplied by time.  So if your change in momentum happens to be -48280, and the time is 5 seconds, you do the math.


I will lay out the final equation for you, as well. F(t2 - t1) = (p2 - p1).  You know p2 = 120, p1 = 48400, t2 = 5, and t1 = 0.","1383264130"

That means that you don't strap on your gun and go over to your ghetto ass neighbors to tell them to turn their music down. That means that when some asshole pushes you in line at the movies, you let it slide, and that definitely means you don't follow a teenager you suspect to be a criminal around the neighborhood and get out of the car. When you have the power to end any conflict with a dead body, it's your responsibility to avoid entering or escalating conflict at all costs. That is what a responsible person who carries does.

Well, other than the reasons Sonya listed above, and possibly the ingestion of food with strong red dyes, I can't think of anything non-tramatic.

I do have to agree with Sonya's diagnosis of microtrauma with capillary bleeding. If I _had_ to hazard a differential diagnosis, it would still have to be a traumatic injury. My guess would be a small tear in the frenulum - the connective tissue at the base of the glans, which connects it to the prepuce, or outer 'hood.' However, after re-reading the original post, this seems out. Still, it's nice to think about.

: ObT: Well, since we are on this subject, another thing that can cause

I remember posting about the first time I had to insert a Foley catheter in someone. My partner, Gene, was a short, scrappy Jew from New York who spent five years working the medic bus on Coney Island, and slowly going bugfuck. We both worked at a hospital-based paramedic unit, and had in-house duties in addition to our field duties - one of which was Foley insertions.

Gene offered to show me how to insert one. In fact, Gene offered to do it for me. If I remember correctly, he also told me that if I didn't feel like putting one in, that I could call him at home, and he'd come over and do it. Yup. New York City. Coney Island. Five years. Poor bastard.

We both walked into an examination room, where an elderly man from a local nursing home was waiting. Apparently his prostate had enlarged to the point where he could no longer urinate. Gene opened a pre-packaged Foley tray plus an appropriate-sized catheter and set up for the procedure. After donning gloves and cleaning the glans with iodine swabs, he looked at me and said:

""The way you hold the penis is *crucial* to a successful Foley catheterization. First *grab* it like you own it.""

With that, one gloved hand reached down and wrapped all five fingers around the shaft of this man's penis. No between the 'thumb 'n forefinger' for Gene, thank you. Like he owned it.

""Then pull the penis *straight* up.""

Hand shot up towards the ceiling, lifting the penis and attached pelvis several inches above the bed.

""Then slowly insert lubricated catheter into the urethra until urine emerges or you reach an obstruction.""

The catheter, which looks like a giant earthworm, was slowly inserted, further and further until the tip of the catheter re-emerged from the penis. The enlarged prostate had blocked the passage of the catheter into the bladder, and forced it to double-back, up the urethra. Ouch.

I left Gene to try again with a smaller catheter. I began to develop gray hairs that day.

Also, secondly, Kobe isn't spelled Kobe, It's spelled Kobi in it's Romanized translation, and Coby in its direct english translation. 

And sorry to go this far, But Oda isn't that shitty of a writer, he understands a character needs proper development and reasoning behind strength advancements. 2 years, learning Observation Haki and possibly getting a strong devil fruit wouldn't get him to an admiral position, The admirals are quite literally SUPER POWERS, They single handed are most definitely in top 10-20 in One Piece for individual power no matter what. They're the 3 strongest fighters of the World Government and there's a reason for how esteemed the position is.

We also know that Green Bull and Purple tiger both WON their seats as admirals through a power competition within the world government. I'm sorry, but there is no way Coby is anywhere even near Vice Admiral level in terms of strength as we dont even know if he has Armament Haki and seeing as though his entire life goal is too eventually become an admiral and all the admirals so far have been all over the age of 40.

Coby is like 14-16 after the timeskip, If a 14 year old becomes an admiral, I'll seriously stop reading, Because there is just no way, even in the One Piece world, that Coby could break that strength shelf to become an admiral(A power stronger than Luffy to our knowledge so far).

If Coby becomes an admiral before Luffy has even beaten a yonkou, I will stop reading One Piece, because there is no logic or reason to ruin the plot like that.","1383264146"

You don't think the government should make prostitution &amp; smoking weed illegal??? Thats weird --- BECAUSE NO AMERICAN UNDER THE AGE OF 30 DOES EITHER

If your ""most important beliefs"" are smoking cigarettes/weed, drinking, and shooting guns...then its no wonder why the U.S. is so fucked right now &amp; people are increasingly viewing libertarianism as a joke

I'm also currently doing a Government and Politics course and we recently finished the unit on Political Parties.

I also got a University scholarship with my basketball career. I'm also coaching a young girl's team for a house league, that's fun and it's rewarding to be able to pass on your skills to the youngin's.   
Going to baseball games are so much fun, i love the hot dogs and the atmosphere of being at the game, nothing compares.
And I have a huge love for hockey, it's very  big in the city I live in, never played it but definitely keep up with the NHL playoffs and I do playoff pools and season pools too. I also played volleyball in school and dabbled in some football when I was younger as well. I don't keep up with football but I like to watch the Superbowl (and not to mainly watch the halftime show, ha) 

I also find a love of sports for guys a huuuuge turn on. Bonus points if he's super passionate about playing any of them.
I hope my kids will love sports as much as I do or more. I'd love to support them and go to their games.

Sorry, I don't mean to invalidate your point because it's definitely legitimate, but a cold can't turn into a flu. They're separate viral infections entirely.

Problem is that I would be in Denali Nat'l Park on a bike ride when the tix were going on sale. My husband was staying home but he's not the best at doing stuff like this (love him but he just messes these little things up fairly often.) So my boss offered to get up on Saturday morning and get tickets for me in case he somehow didn't. TM was so overloaded neither of them could get tickets...then she had the brilliant thought of buying two tickets separately! We're sitting in different sections for Seattle but we're in! And she's letting me work from Seattle (I have a deadline the day of the show) so that I can go. She f'in rocks!

TL; DR - my boss got on-line on a Saturday morning and ensured I got PJ tix since I was in the wilderness and is letting me work remotely so I can go.","1383264154"

My fiance and I are going to have a very simple courthourse ceremony followed by a family-and-close-friends shindig. However, I *do* want to look good. The dress I've been eyeballing is [this](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/dresses/pine-all-mine-dress). My fiance loves it, and I really like it. I've seen here for other olive dresses that a lot of the time taupe, grey, or bronze shoes are suggested, which was a lot better than my idea of black (maybe that would be too somber), and I really liked [this](http://www.modcloth.com/shop/shoes-heels/treasure-stroll-heel-in-black) heel. 

[This](https://www.etsy.com/listing/165399495/grey-wool-capelet) is what I'd also like to wear with it, since it's going to be in January and I will be outside for a brief time. Besides that, I'm not sure what else goes well. 

I'm not afraid for more exciting colors (not too exciting, I have a weak constitution lawdy), I just...I really don't know what works with what. I just want to look good for once.

I would also not be adverse to finding a cheaper version of that dress! ","1383264155"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","This argument sounds preemptive to me. J has three months severance before financial issues even enter the picture. You are arguing over hypotheticals when you don't even know what the situation is going to be. 

I've made the mistake of being too overzealous to help a friend. I had a friend went through something similar and I immediately offered to help him out, thinking that he would be homeless soon and that's what any friend would do. I won't get into details, but in the end his situation ended up not being nearly as dire as I anticipated, and instead of feeling like I helped a friend in need, I felt like I was treated as a safety net for him to continue a irresponsible lifestyle. I felt taken advantage of and I resented it. Had I waited to offer help, he would have likely ended up just fine without my assistance. 

It sounds like you already feel like J and K make irresponsible financial decisions, and if you offer help financially at this stage, you probably won't like how they choose to use that help, and you'll be frustrated at your fiance for putting you in the position of feeling used. However, I also think it's preemptive to completely rule out the possibility at this point. If they aren't expecting help, they may step things up and tighten their belts and still find themselves in a really tough spot. Given your husband's feelings of debt, it is reasonable that he might want to return the favor at some point. This is probably the scenario that your fiance envisions because he was in a position where he truly needed help. 

I think you should talk with your husband about not making any decisions or promises now, but you agree to reopen the conversation when J and K are actually at the point where they are in trouble. That way, you can talk about their actual level of need and ways that you can help them out, rather than argue over hypotheticals. There's no point in putting strain on your relationship over a decision that may not even be necessary. 

If they get to the point where they are in real trouble, perhaps there are compromises you can make. For example, you won't give them a bunch of money which they might put towards their wedding or expensive cars, but you might be willing to buy them groceries or a gas card, but don't even go there until you need to.

Cutting weight really, really sucks. A lot of people who've never been around it (most 1st year wrestlers) don't realize just how tough it is, physically and especially mentally. It sucks so bad, it can take something fun like wrestling and make it totally miserable. Don't let it ruin your first (and probably only) real season.

Winning isn't as important as learning about yourself and having a good time. Push yourself to adapt to wrestling bigger dudes, it's a lot more valuable than pushing yourself to cut weight.

If you do decide to drop down, do it smart (slowly) and don't pile the weight right back on after each time you weigh in. But most importantly, have fun man. All of us ""former"" wrestlers get sentimental this time of year, wishing we could be gearing up for the season right now. Leave your future self with no regrets.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","&gt; But a few already do, ahead of the Nexus 5.

The LG G2, what other Android phones have OIS built in ?

&gt; Worse resolution than the HTC One.

Because the HTC one is a 4.7 inch display? i doubt the average person can tell a 468 ppi vs 444 ppi difference. Oh yeah, the HTC One is 4.7 inch :( Not a plus for most people. Most people are upgrading for a bigger screen.

&gt; Anyone can install pure Android on their phone - I did but prefer Sense and reverted back after a few weeks (better camera, gallery, contacts apps)

Not 'anyone' can install pure android. Requires reading up on material to even start if you don't even know where to begin. Most people don't like Sense nor Touchwiz. You're gonna be in the minority if you think most people prefer Sense over stock Android. 

&gt; Anyone can get that if they're running pure Android.

Direct from Google? No you won't. You most likely will get a half baked ROM that will come with all kinds of issues and bugs since Google engineers did not develop for that specific phone (in your case the HTC One). In terms of getting an official update? Good luck. Will take months to get it through, especially with HTC's terrible track record of updates. Also, the camera on the HTC one is abysmal for a 'premium' phone.  

&gt; That is quite cheap, but irrelevant for me as work pays for my contract.

Ok, but not everyone gets their work to pay for their phone bill. You're an exception, not the majority. 

&gt; Erm? I much prefer the aluminium chassis of the One.

We differ here. Many like the matte chassis. The HTC One is known to cuff pretty easily. 

&gt; I'm struggling to see what makes it 'amazing'.

Ok? It's not amazing to you. It's amazing to many on here. HTC One is using an older S600 SoC. There have been many gains in power efficiency with the S800.","1383264162"

"Netrunner","t5_2td0c","I think our edge in getting access to the cards more quickly because of our local distributor may help get the packs out to the players more quickly.

That inevitably led to some getting the book early, and I don't know what Fantasy Flight's attitude might be. I plan to get in touch with them to learn more.

One of my current projects is to get sleeve options into our webstore so that it's a simple click for players that want them. I think you're right on with that idea.

We've run five gaming leagues at our meetups over the past year, but I've shied away from *Netrunner* because it feels as though our city is saturated with events. I'll take some time to ask around and see what the players I know think.

You're quite right about learning the game. I'll admit: I learned enough to play, played about a dozen or so matches, and determined it wasn't exactly for me.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;It's been a long time since I read that one, but I seem to remember that she had evidence that she was transitioning, and that the ""disturbance"" in the bathroom was merely that she didn't look female enough.

From accounts I've read ""she"" offered a pamphlet about transitioning, not any legal papers. 

So here we have a case of a  two-time child rapist who cross-dresses or thinks he's trans, is not very convincing as a woman, has not been declared trans in any legal capacity, asked to leave a woman's restroom and reporters only focus on the ""transgender discrimination"" part of the story.

So again, I ask you, how can any authority eject a male person from a women's restroom as long as he claims to be trans if this is how it's reported? 

&gt;So, what are you saying? That trans people aren't harassed in the bathrooms? If you don't like that story from a McDonalds bathroom, move on to the next one, or the next, because they just keep on coming.

I'm saying the incident had nothing to do with the victim being transgendered, so using it as a case of transgender bathroom harassment isn't accurate.

And again you told me ""4 or 5 news stories"" wasn't adequate to demonstrate that cross-dressing men enter women's restrooms with ill intents or for sexual gratification, and yet you think 2 or 3 stories, one of which is misreported and another of which skips details about the person in question being a convicted sexual predator, to be enough to say there needs to be a law sanctioning restroom use. 

&gt;That is not about ""gendering their child's play."" Wherever that misconception comes from, it's bullshit. 

They gave the boys Iron Man and other ""boys"" toys and the girls Dora and other ""girls"" toys. Children's toys are heavily gendered as it is. [Boys especially have their play and interests strictly enforced by culture](http://www.lettoysbetoys.org.uk/why-does-the-toy-industry-think-boys-dont-cook/). I'm highly skeptical of the idea that if a boy wants to play with a baby doll, or ponies, or something pink that there must be something wrong with him that needs fixing. A ""toy test"" is also often used to help determine what sex to assign intersex babies, which I also find highly questionable. 

Secondly, where does a 6 year old get the concept of doctors ""fixing"" him and giving him girl parts? That doesn't seem like an idea a child so young would conjure up all on their own.

Think about it this way: if you read a story where parents were saying their 6 year old son was asking them when the church could fix him and make him stop liking boys and like girls instead, would you believe that the child came up with this notion independently? 

&gt; You're exactly right that gender dysphoria has a biological cause. 

Not really biological. I suppose you could call the chemical imbalances in the brain that cause depression biological, but it's not an inherent part of brain development. I have to ask why people think the only possible treatment for relieving gender dysphoria is to have the person emulate the opposite sex and surgically alter their bodies, [which isn't effective in many cases](http://www.sexchangeregret.com/).

I have to wonder if gender-variant children are feeling pressure from adults to emulate the opposite sex because it's more comfortable for society than a boy who likes pink things. I wonder how many of these children truly suffer dysphoria and what their futures might be like. I feel like these are issues that should be explored but particular subsets of people are resistant to the topic even coming up. 

&gt; They've been doing it for years and it's the right thing to do

How many years? 10? 20? 30? Enough years to see the long-term effects on a person in their adult life? 

&gt;I'm asking people to mind their god damn business and treat trans people as just another woman in the bathroom. We have to do it legally because assholes like you can't be trusted to be decent people voluntarily.

So you feel people need to be made legally obligated to mind their own business?

&gt;Of course you have that right. And I will treat that as hostility and respond with, fuck you.

I go back to not being able to win (EDIT: ""win"" as in reach any sort of middle ground) with some transactivists. *Everything* is hostility, *everything* is ""transphobia"". Acknowleding physical reality is ""fucked up"". Asking questions and voicing skepticism is the same as killing people. It demonstrates a reliance on hyperbole and emotional appeals. 

&gt;Because I'm not the only person that laws are written for. I'm not satisfied with inequality and injustice just because it doesn't affect me.

If not having your use of the women's room, which you already participate in, legally justified is ""injustice"" to you... I'm not even sure what to say to that.

A few questions, 
With your 5k time, how are you hoping to get it down, bar lots of practice?

Did you ever aim towards being a long distance runner, or a short? From what i gathered you preferred longer at a slower pace to lose weight, did that make you more inclined to try longer distances than push harder for shorter? 


As funnily enough, i have done the opposite and aim for faster 5km times (only just started and just about hitting 25min) but has made me love attempting longer distances.

"christian_ancaps","t5_2y9io","I was raised in a church that did not shy away from the hard questions or skip past the hard verses of the Bible in the youth group. As a consequence, many of the atheists arguments I come across are quite inadequate. Anything from the movie Zeitgeist or skeptics bible do not hold up under analysis. 

I spend too much time reading /r/DebateAChristian and find most of the arguments to be taking a verse, isolating it from context, and very aggressively running with an argument that is maintained only by strength of will.  Of course, addressing these arguments can be difficult as there is an emotional barrier (Contradiction will be rejected until proven otherwise), the bad arguments are really based in a deeper more philosophically involved argument (Objective vs subjective truth), etc.

It is dishonest to say that religion is the cause of ""x"" and ""y"" horrible acts when in secular regimes we have seen similar ""x"" and ""y"" committed. The atheist state of the USSR was highly xenophobic and homophobic, so much so that modern Russia actually has homophobia that is not based in the Orthodox church. We can argue back forth, throwing examples of secular vs religious populations and the terrible things they both did, but to do so *misses* the point completely.

The ""x"" and ""y"", the evil we do, is independent of religion. It occurs regardless, through individuals who find the justifications they can for it. It is certainly so that many terrible things have been committed in the name of God, but also in the name of progress, change, and enlightenment (French revolution). It is equally dishonest to say that atheism or not believing in my religion is the cause of ""x"" or ""y"" evil.

Christianity is the acknowledgement of our total depravity and our need for complete spiritual renewal. The Christian is equally capable of evil and does evil; as does the atheist, the Buddhist, the Jew, etc. The Christian, however, recognizes their depravity and seeks the forgiveness of the Father and of the gradual sanctification (The process of being made new) of ourselves by the Holy Spirit. This process is completed upon death and is called glorification (Being reborn completely). A critical part of being a Christian is relationship we build with God and seek to grow over our days.

I kind of get how you mean with regards to being the person that everyone looks to for help or strength. It can be exhausting, but take solace in the fact that these people probably appreciate you so so much, and that they would most definitely care if you disappeared. To me the most noble of lives is that lived for others.

I also used to think that strength comes from not expressing your emotions, and hiding under a facade. Then I realised true strength comes from being able to face your emotions and thoughts, and that it is ok to be vulnerable and human sometimes, because we all are.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Hang

Do you remember your first kiss...or the first time you got to drive the car _all_ by yourself? Well, I remember my first hanging....            
I was a 'probie' (uh - that means 'probationary' - ya pervs), with barely three months on the job. My partner was 'walk 'em dead' Fred, a crusty old veteran with nearly twenty years on the job. We were sitting in a diner, having breakfast - or should I say, Fred was eating an _enormous_, greasy breakfast, while I was sipping coffee and getting queesy just watching him, when we received our first call of the day:

""Ambulance 8, respond priority three, [some address], for a possible 'sudden.'""

A 'sudden' - around these parts, at least, stands for 'sudden death,' which means that a person has been dead for quite some time. Usually the police call for an ambulance only so that they can write in their report that a 'medical' person saw the body and said 'he's dead.'

Fred acknowledged the call over our portable radio, and I finished my cup of coffee, got up and started fishing some money out of my pocket, when Fred said:""Hey, where are you going?"" ""Uh, Fred, don't we have to go on that call?"" ""Relax, the person's dead - and they're not going anywhere."" So, I sat down, and watched while Fred finished his eggs, bacon, toast, and home-fries, _plus_ hash, and his third cup of coffee, while I ordered another cup of coffee, myself. I admit, I was a little worried, since we were supposed to be responding to a call. Eventually, Fred finished his breakfast, paid, and we left. As soon as I climbed into the ambulance, Fred gunned the motor, and turned on the lights and siren. We lurched away from the curb, and began to madly weave in and out of rush-hour traffic. Time for my next stupid question:

""Uh, Fred, aren't we supposed to go priority _three_?""

""What, and get to the call late? You want to get us fired?""

We pull up to the address just as dispatch is calling for our ETA. The police and the fire departments were already there. A cop strolls over to us and starts talking to Fred:""Hey Fred - how's the wife. blah, blah,"" I followed a firefighter into the basement of a house. It's dark and musty, and firefighter tells me that he thinks the guy killed himself over the weekend because ""he smells so bad."" Joy.

As I shine my flashlight ahead, I can see the body of a sixty-ish year-old male, hanging from one of the support beams. As I get closer, I begin to notice the smell of old urine and feces. Finally I reached the body, and I notice that he hanged himself with an electrical cord. As I shined my light on his feet and let the light play over his body, I noticed his ankles were a mottled dark purple, and his pants have dried urine stains on them, his hands are also purple. Then I reach his neck - from the electrical-cord up, his skin takes on a lighter purple, waxy sheen. His eyes are slightly bulged-out, and his tongue is out and to the left (positive 'Q' sign). The firefighter tells me to wait for my partner, and he leaves.

It got _real_ quiet after he left, and the smell was beginning to make me want to retch. I also noticed that I had to pee, which may have had something to do with the coffee I had earlier. I wanted to leave, but I'd never seen a hanged corpse before - I was fascinated. I let the beam of my flashlight shine on the man's face for a couple of minutes. Then, I could've _sworn_ he was breathing! &lt;- more on that later. I got closer, and was staring at his face - to see if he really was breathing. I knew logically that he'd been dead for a while, but...

Then the body came towards me, and his arms swung up as if to grab me. I screamed (yes - like a girly-boy) and took a step back - and tripped over the chair he'd used to 'jump' off. I felt the warm wetness of a guy who'd just lost bladder control, and heard laughter from behind the body. Fred.

He'd entered from the other side, snuck-up from behind the body, and waited 'till I'd gotten close enough - then he pushed the body. Behind Fred, were _all_ the cops and firefighters - laughing at me. When they saw my urine-stained pants, they laughed even louder.

As we were heading back to the base - to get a change of clothes, Fred looked over and said:""Don't feel so bad - my partner did it to me when I was new."" I really wanted to hit Fred. But that was many years ago... And I've had my chance to do it someone else - she never forgave me.

I miss Fred now.

----
 Explanation: Someone explained to me that if you shine a bright light at a statue for several minutes while staring intently at it - you might see it begin to 'breathe.' Some optical illusion. The guy used to do this in high school - go to the cemetary at night with some friends and stare at statues. Used to scare the willies out of people.

"conservatives","t5_2qj2e","I think before we get into this you should ask yourself this question. Do you want Benghazi to be a scandal? If the answer is yes, than you are going to believe more circumstantial evidence and make more assumptions that would lead to negative outcomes than the average person who begins from a neutral perspective. I only ask because you include questions which directly attribute malice to decisions made.
  
Here is a fairly detailed timeline of the incident that I've referenced before.
http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/benghazi-timeline/

 &gt; Is it that the White house let it happen because they didn't heed the warning calls from a general or other military commander? 
  
 &gt; &gt;Apparently folks there had been begging for more security.
  
I'm not sure what these statements mean. If the embassy was begging for security before the attack than they wouldn't be begging the White House, they would be begging the State Department. Speaking of State Department Security, surely part of the reason the Embassy wasn't better protected more heavily was because funding for it was cut, and Hillary Clinton was not spearheading that effort.
http://thehill.com/homenews/house/250237-gop-embassy-security-cuts-draw-democrats-scrutiny
  
http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2011/02/secretary-clinton-house-republ.html
  
http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/15/opinion/republicans-have-no-shame.html?_r=0
  
 &gt; That is part of it. The fact is that they knew it was a terrorist attack, but they played it off as reaction to an online film. The issue here is that they did not tell the truth because it would have made Obama look bad before the election.
  
Here you attributing malice to the response, and even citing what the intent was, when you don't really know. Hours before the Benghazi attack, there was a confirmed Egyptian protest over the video. It's not like they pulled that reasoning out of thin air.
  
http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/11/egypt-protest
  
I agree that they shouldn't have rushed out with the video as a reason, and that is just poor judgement on their part. If they had doubts it wasn't the video than they failed to check sources and ran with something that sounded ""good"".
  
  &gt;After she knew that this was a terror attack, she assured the mother of one of the dead that she would go after the guy that made the video.
  
Again you claim to know her intent, and that she would willfully lie to someone, which suggests malice. The just as likely scenario is that she was going on the intelligence of the time. Even if they figured out they were wrong, and didn't immediately go back on the video story, it still would not be malicious towards this one woman in this circumstance.
  
They are going to (and should) hold back on saying it is terrorism until they are absolutely sure. It's just like journalism, you gather multiple sources to confirm facts, and you don't break a story until you have them. If that was the case than they are guilty of rushing with the video incident as an explanation instead of simply saying, ""we don't know yet"".
  
  &gt; Hence the investigations.
  
What did they uncover that is not included in this conversation? I'm sure there were official reviews of the situation by the Military and Congress. At this point you are down to saying the scandal is that their explanation the day after the attack was wrong. That's a pretty weak ""scandal"". 
  
  &gt; there is some suggestion that the Benghazi embassy was engaged in illegal arms transactions.
  
 &gt; There's a closet full of covered-up scandals just falling out of the State Department right now.
  
This is why I started my question by asking you your viewpoint. It doesn't sound like you want hard facts for your allegations. It sounds like you want to sling mud on the wall and see what sticks. I don't want ""suggestions"" about what happened and why. As a neutral observer, I want facts. I'm not even claiming that Benghazi was ""handled well"" after the event. I'm not claiming anything, except that those claiming that Benghazi is some huge scandal are standing on pretty weak ground.","1383264176"

       snakes in general tend to not have personality. they can be very tame but they rarely show personality.
       our tortoises are very personal, and much like dogs. some of them are pesky tortoises and some of them are sweet and come running towards us when we enter the enclosure! :) tortoises i would say are the most common reptile to have distinct personalities. its one of the main reasons i like tortoises so much. 
        our rhino iguanas do have alot of personality, but not the good type! they tend to be rather short tempered, if you mess around in the cage for extend periods of time (like when you are cleaning it or whatever) they try to either make a run for it by escaping the doors (which remain open when you clean for ventilation purposes) or they try to run at you!

It means they focused on the games with the hardware design. And that is a good thing. I don't play FPS on console. I am a PC Gamer at heart. But I am choosing the PS4 because it obviously has gamers at heart in its design and business model. The other things can all come later.

"90daysgoal","t5_2s0sd","Hello people. This is my first time here. I am interested in gaining strength while keeping body fat under control. Right now, my lower body lifts (squat, deadlift) aren't too bad, and are pushing intermediate. However, my upper body strength is abysmal. I've been following stronglifts, but recently with only 3x5, and with added chins and recently, ab wheel rollouts. 

Another thing I want to work on is my shoulder stability. My shoulders are extremely unstable. I can drop them out of their sockets at will. I have ordered some resistance tubes, and plan to work on my rotator cuff strength. I also want to see a physiotherapist about the issue.

**Stats**

* 16 M
* 5' 9""
* Calculated powerlifting total: 685 lbs (260/150/275) @ 158 lbs
* Diet: I am vaguely aware of my protein total, and otherwise just eat as much as I can, as I've been bulking. When I cut, I usually use some kind of IF. I've tried counting calories and macros, but I can't keep it up. I'm totally vegetarian. I'm also mostly vegan, both for ethical reasons and because I'm dairy intolerant. I do, however, make exceptions on special occasions, and I use eggs if they are from a farm I deem good.
* I reckon I'm about 16-17% bodyfat right now.

**Overall goals**

* Improve my powerlifting total, especially the bench, and improve general upper body strength.
* Increase muscle mass without exceeding my current approximate BF%.
* Improve cardiovascular fitness, hopefully run without getting shin pain.
* Take up a martial art or combat sport.
* Fix anterior pelvic tilt.
* Stabilize shoulders, as much as possible.

**Sprint 1 goals**

* Cut fat while keeping strength.
* Start on shoulders.
* Avoid shin pain while barefoot running.
* Start Muay Thai classes.
* Regularly stretch hip flexors.
* BE CONSISTENT

Consistency is something that I have struggled with ever since I started training about a year ago. If I had been consistent, I would have got so much further. Instead, I frequently skip sessions due to feeling lethargic. I barely trained at all in the summer, and lost a lot of strength. 

This sprint/rest cycle sounds like a good idea to me. I feel it might help with my consistency. The rests could do with being a tad longer though.

I plan to cut for at least the first one or two sprints. I may well end up cutting through the whole thing, in which case I don't expect to see much muscle or strength gain. God I hate cutting.","1383264184"

"trumpet","t5_2qs7x","Both pieces of advice can work.  The problem is that if you're practicing for too long and starting to lose focus, you rely on bad habits, especially in the upper register.  You need to learn the difference between good tired and bad tired.  You shouldn't be tired because you feel bruised or because your lip has been pressed flat by pressure. Usually, the good tired results in your corners just giving way and getting wobbly, even in the mid register.  

If you're working on specific music, it can be dangerous as you attempt to play sections that you really shouldn't keep trying at.  If you keep not being able to hit whatever high note, stop playing that section.  More often than not you'll start compensating with bad habits.  Skip that section and continue practicing any mid range stuff or fundamentals.

If you want to go to absolute fatigue, just keep reducing the range you're playing in.  Go long enough and you won't even be able to hold out a middle G for 4 counts without your corners quivering into failure.  This is almost a weightlifting approach to endurance, but if you keep trying to play high, you're probably going to injure yourself.

That said, you need to be extra judicious about how you practice and how far you let yourself go as big auditions/performances come up.  People's recovery time can be slightly different.  Just be smart about it and on the day of anything, never let yourself overdo any playing before the concert/audition.  By that time, the time for practice is over.  You can only make things worse by wearing yourself out.

Drink plenty and get lots of sleep.  Saying hydrated and getting rest will help with the recovery time when you push yourself to the absolute brink.

You shouldn't be getting airy notes.  That sound like pressure and strain to me.  That's probably a note you should stop trying to hit in that practice session.  You should be able to finish big and full up until the point that you are literally so fatigued that you can't hold an embouchure.","1383264186"

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","I would have suggested learning all that before you jumped into crowd funding. Being a brilliant designer is one thing (nice product), being a knowledgable business person is another. This is what gets to me regarding the wild-west-esque kickstarter stuff these days. 

Looking at your Kickstarter, these are the issues I see:

* No brand identity, logo, anything
* No website for all of that traffic to go to 
* Thus, missed opportunity to develop an email list
* Way too wordy. Being thorough is on thing, writing a 20 page paper about a keychain is another. 
* No packaging

You're launching a product on a website that gets more traffic than you will get for a very long time. You should be using that traffic to direct people to your own website, get them signed up for your email list, and start forming a relationship between them and your brand. I know for a fact many folks will see a product on kickstarter then wait until it gets produced to buy it later. However, you do not have a brand because you have not developed it yet. Why is this important? Because it's the difference between being ""That thing I bought on Kickstarter"" **this year** and ""that awesome brand that makes cool stuff"" **next year**. 

Bringing things to market is a lot more than just product design. You've got that down, but without branding and a business plan you'll sell whatever on the campaign then you won't sell anymore because no one will know where to find you. You need to learn business or hire a business side to your brand, and start actually building it. Or license it and step away, move on to something else. 

Source: I ran a Kickstarter campaign and went on to sell hundreds of thousands in $$ independently while making different printed publications with the same product for 3 years and counting.","1383264189"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;When I did my coursework for a major in political science, we discussed the ramifications of mandating maternity leave, and from what I was taught, it's not exactly clear that mandating maternity leave is an obvious decision with clear-cut consequences.

I can see then how you would see this problem from a policy oriented perspective, but do you deny that there exists a great number of women and families who would directly benefit from maternity leave?

&gt;I didn't realize that I posted anything that needed a source. If I did, can you point to the specific statement that needs to be supported?

My issue was with this statement:

&gt;That isn't the issue for the majority of women, because the majority of jobs offer some form of maternity leave. Making maternity leave mandatory would only affect women in jobs that don't currently offer maternity leave, who, quite frankly, are usually not in a position to raise children successfully anyway.

I don't believe most employers offer paid leave, and I would like to see a source.

&gt;Except, after a minor decrease in fertility due to the recession, the US birth rate is coming back up. We're still hovering around the replacement rate, so it's a little premature to call it a problem.

Okay, but do you agree that there are large numbers of women and families who sacrifice much just to keep us at the replacement rate? I believe we should be able to sustain our population without forcing such sacrifices on so many people.

&gt;The government = the people. The people have not decided to prioritize a maternity leave mandate, so the decision has essentially been made (though you're welcome to try to reverse it). 

[Nixon vetoed a bill for child care, which I believe is a very closely related issue, and Bush vetoed a bill for maternal leave.] (http://books.google.com/books?id=s1MHVFBxbRYC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=maternity+leave+veto+nixon&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TubxUNzRkE&amp;sig=YFEh89p4Ctwjt9lYJomtRCOkPu8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1u1yUp2ACqnhiAKQkoCwBw&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=maternity%20leave%20veto%20nixon&amp;f=false). I strongly disagree that this issue isn't a concern for the people. I also think it's absurd to come to your conclusion that people don't care about it simply based on that one argument. Just look at this thread which blew up, or do a quick google search which will result in numerous groups and organizations dedicated to this specific issue.

&gt;As I said, many positions occupied by skilled and/or college-educated workers already offer maternity leave, so you'd mostly be extending it to members of the lowest socioeconomic strata. In fact, society benefits most by limiting the births in those strata (see: Freakonomics' examination of abortion and its role in reducing crime). 

I don't believe the current lack of maternity leave limits births as much as it perpetuates poverty among those who have children regardless.

&gt;21% of American women take more than a year off. You don't need ""most women"" to take that much time off to affect the statistics, especially since the gender pay gap amounts to much less than 21% when you account for hours worked. We agree that this is one of many factors, but I think it's irresponsible to minimize it.

I agree that maternal leave, if mandated, should be limited to a relatively short period of 12-16 weeks. ","1383264191"

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","&gt; I thought these were the people you were discussing beating up.

Yeah, bullies.  Most of the time you don't beat them up.  Maybe you get a hit in if you're lucky during the time you're getting beat.  A good pop to the nose sometimes is all it takes.  You use the least amount of violence to get the point across because you just want it to end and any time you're dishing it out you're taking it worse.

&gt; Ignoring the fact that ""sociopath"" isn't even a medical term (it's a pop culture diagnosis) 

By sociopath I mean someone who lacks the ability to feel empathy, perhaps combined with a sadistic streak.  I'm glad you haven't had to experience that.

&gt; aren't you saying that the bullies are lunatics who might just flip out and kill you if you attack them?

No.  I'm saying they get a sick thrill from toying with you and inflicting fear and pain.  They smile (a lot) when they do it.  Controlling someone like that when the rest of their life is (usually) fucked up is massively empowering to them.  They prefer passive targets and usually move on when they don't have one as a victim.

&gt;  I think you are operating on some sort of insane Ayn Rand logic here.

Could you be more specific?  Actually the logic here if any is simple operant conditioning.  It works on primitive creatures like bullies when not much else gets through to them.  These kids are either born sick fucks or had a lifetime of abuse to twist them into little monsters.  By the time they get to this point they don't give a shit about your culture of acceptance and tolerance and they're too far gone to change.  You'd have to change the entire environment they grew up in.

&gt; So how come there's countries where it isn't an issue and countries where it's a huge problem?

I don't know, I don't live there.  Where are these magical places?

&gt; Pretending that culture doesn't play a HUGE part in this is just nonsensical. And you can change the culture.

It probably does, just on a scale the school can't touch.  Dysfunctional families and abusive environments aren't going away with anti-bullying tutoring.

Look, bullies bully because they like to hurt people. It makes them feel good and in control.  They don't care what adults tell them about jack fucking shit.  They go through the motions and roll their eyes and laugh at the stupid fucks trying to tell them that if they're nice that things will be better.  *They don't care*.  At that point the only thing they respond to is an immediate, painful reaction.  They may be morons and sadists but they know better than to touch a hot stove.","1383264192"

"SecurityAnalysis","t5_2s7v0","yeah I understand this. I'm trying to persuade my sisters on dollar cost averaging and thus, no need to analyze any P/E ratios etc, but when I thought about it last night and looked at the index average P/E it was listed at 17.3 for the DOW and 20 for the S&amp;P500. 

For individual stocks and the enterprising investor I would totally agree that looking at P/E is dangerous and instead a complete business valuation should be done and then compared to the total market value the company is currently selling at. If there is a safety of margin with a good business then the person should buy.

However, my siblings are going to be passive. Once again dollar cost averaging a index would be ideal, but when the market index is above a certain threshold I was wondering if this would be a signal that the market is forming a bubble. 

If I recall correctly, during the downturn of 2009 the market P/E index of the dow hit around 12 and I would believe that the 15 P/E ratio would be an ""indifference point"" for the market as a whole. 

Of course, during any spectrum of bottomed out markets or overheated markets, if you can find an undervalued company then you should invest, but as the market becomes more and more saturated with speculation the undervalued companies will eventually dwindle down to a trickle i.e. be harder to find. 

I'm just wondering if the average index P/E would be a nice metric to judge whether there will be more or less undervauled companies on average. i.e. when the index is P/E 12 or below is more undervauled companies and when its above 15 or some dummy variable there will be less undervauled companies on average.

Also, wanted to know if dividends were included in dividends which bardown beauty put his 2 cents in.","1383264194"

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Highway

From: st871622@pip.cc.brandeis.edu (you're reading what?)
Subject: 3 am on a highway
Date: Wed, 27 Apr 1994 12:35:58 GMT

I recently went to a call for a motor vehicle accident on a major
highway in my service area. While enroute to the call - we received
an update that it was a 'car vs. deer - no injuries.' Apparently,
a deer had stumbled across this major highway, and since all MASS
drivers travel ten to twenty miles over the speed limit, this guy's
car struck the deer going oh - say seventy to eighty miles per hour.
Upon our arrival, we found a Ford Probe with it's front end demolished,
windshield flattened, with expired deer laying across both front seats,
and one visibly shaken driver, sitting on the sidewalk, smoking a butt.
When the car struck the deer (from the side), the front of the car went
under the deer's body, breaking it's legs, and bringing the deer up and
over the hood of the car. It then smashed through the windshield, and 
landed on the lap of the driver. As it was still alive, it started to
trash wildly, while the driver - amazingly - was able to guide the car
over several lanes onto the breakdown lane. The driver was fine, if not
a little shaken. He was also covered in deer blood and ground glass. We
asked the guy if he wanted to go to the hospital, to which he replied:
""I just want to get a Valium from the car,"" and opened the glove-box of
the car and retrieved and prescription pill bottle from it. I noticed 
that it had the name of a woman on it, and asked ""Uh, excuse me, but is
that you Valium?"" Normally I wouldn't ask such a question - but since
the cops and fire-fighters were busy looking at the deer carcass, we had
some modicum of privacy. ""Well, this is my grandmother's prescription. But
sometimes - you know."" He smiled sheepishly. Ah , if he only knew...
The days when my gramps was alive - every month I'd accompany him to the
pharmacy, where he'd pick up his _fifteen_ prescriptions, go home, and 
watch him toss all fifteen bottles into a shopping bag - overflowing with
other bottles o' drugs. He never took them, but since Medicare paid for
it all, he made damn sure he got them every month. Which was good for me
since he had prescriptions for Valium, Percocet, and (my favorite) Tranxene,
the 'benzodiazepine for a man on the move.' Just as my eyes began to glaze
over in reverie to the good 'ol days, my attention was called by the fact
that the cops were taking pictures of the vehicle. As I moved closer, I
noticed that they had moved the deer carcass to a seated position on the
passenger side, and they had propped one of it's shattered legs out the 
window, an old baseball cap had been placed in a rakish angle on it's head,
as well as a lit cigarette between it's lips. The cops were taking turns
sitting (gingerly) in the driver's seat, with an arm around the deer, while
another would take a picture of him. Not to miss my chance, I hurried over
to get my picture taken - then I got another call - damn. As I rolled on
the next call - I swore I would make whoever called me away from my picture-
taking pay dearly for the interruption. And I did. But that's another story.

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","&gt; A space traveling advanced society that didn't have population census? That's just non-sense.

when I made that statement I was mostly thinking about the settlers situation in most other sci-fi scenarios. Being millions of miles a way from a real civilization, transportation to and from said places taking days/weeks at a time, with who knows what happening during those trips.

&gt; After the printing press was invented, all major events in history have a pretty good recording of, even on earth far before computers were invented. The story is non-sense, it would only make sense if they were a pretty barbaric society, which doesn't make sense.

True that helped major events get global recognition but it didn't stop wars, it didn't stop people from going out of there way to try and destroy alot of information for whatever reason or stop them from simply lying. 

Now with all that being said, how advanced were they really when they landed? Or better yet why make Cassus the, frontier colony planet, the shining capital of the entire dominion instead of the planet or planets  they all originally came from? Did they like the humans in firefly use up all the resources on their home planet/planets and just haul ass to the next star system?

Degree/no degree is a cut and dry rule, that doesn't mean every comment will be correct, but it's a way of getting more information to the reader of the comment.

I would suggest to keep trying in IRC. You will probably need to wait longer than 1/2 an hour though. Depending on the day/time, channels can fill up extremely fast, or take a really long time. What happens a lot in IRC is that the channel appears partway full for a long time, then all of a sudden a bunch of players join as the previous game ends.

And if is ignoring the community and bliss ignorance towards Treyarch is their idea of redeeming themselves, then i am worried for them. They didnt implement Hardpoint because it was never in IW games, however Treyarch did it with Kill Confirmed. The problem with IW is they are shooting themselves in the foot, they are only looking towards the growth of their own games, not the growth of the actual series, which means every 2 years is a step back for CoD. 1 step forward, two steps back. And i could care less how the game plays, it could be the smoothest CoD ever, but with no competitive support, it wont accomplish much.","1383264203"

I think you would be able to put a 600 series card into your laptop without a BIOS flash, but mobile GPUs are very expensive.  You are looking at around 500 dollars if you want to buy a 680m on ebay.  Even then its even harder to find one with the correct heatsink.  On top of that you may have to modify the heatsink for it to fit in your chassis.  On top of that you are going to have to purchase a new power brick.  If you have the time and money, go for it, but with the money you would be spending, you could buy a new computer.","1383264209"

I wonder if he knows that? Better not bring that up. I read how guys are sensitive about size or something. Never knew what they were talking about really. 

Wait, aside from that... is that a mechanical arm?! And leg?! Whoa, this doesn't make any sense! I never saw anyone with these kinds of things. Aren't these supposed to only happen in manga or anime?

People never seemed to think that we could actually be dating and always thought we we were friends. Mind you this was in Nashville and not some small podunk town. She was an amazing girl though who spoke Swahili (and taught me a bit) and also spoke her tribal language from Tanzania. When I first met her parents they looked at me and the very first thing they said to my girlfriend at the time (in Swahili) was ""He is not black. Who is he? Why is he here?"" This was after she had already introduced me as her new boyfriend. My parents conversely were very accepting, but it was weird how much her parents just thought I was not right for her solely based on my race. I definitely think for her parents it was a cultural thing and apparently the day after me and my ex broke up her parents had a party celebrating that we were finished..... I was not invited.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I've been living in Zurich for twelve years, in fact ever since I was seven when I moved here from Brazil. I am well aware of the unwillingness of most Swiss to speak other languages, even High German. I guess it's just something you learn to deal with when you live and practically grow up here. You have to understand that the Swiss are very proud of their language and would not abandon it for the world. But the truth is that even if you try to speak Swiss German, most Swiss will speak High German to you if you speak with even a slight accent and needless to say it's almost impossible to speak Swiss German properly if you haven't grown up here.
But I think there is a certain dichotomy if you look at both the young and old Swiss. Most young people are very tolerant and open towards you, even if you may not speak Swiss German or even German very well. It's just that the older people seem to be a bit more reserved towards foreigners.
I have been to many different places and I can tell you that when I went to Malta the people there were the most unfriendly people I have ever seen and I have also seen people from other countries that were unfriendly. It has nothing to do with Zurich in particular, there are people like that everywhere in the world unfortunately.

And the Swiss are not all aloof as is the stereotype, especially the young people aren't as I have mentioned before. However, I have to be frank and say that I am unfortunately far colder and more aloof than even most Swiss, which is ironic considering that I was born in Brazil. But that is just me personally and I can attest that many people here are very open and extroverted. The stereotypical aloof, neutral, taciturn Swiss is really just a stereotype and nothing more.

The client pulls up message A, which looks like ""&lt;Entity 1&gt; uses &lt;Skill&gt;.\n&lt;Entity 2&gt; takes &lt;damage&gt; damage.\n""  it plugs the data in, and spits it out on your screen.

It shows up in your log as two lines, but it was sent as a single packet.  Something in the client's own logic is splitting them up like that, which is... kind of the wrong way to do things.  Don't get me started on the decisions that SE makes with their game clients.

"Turkey","t5_2qlnu","Fair enough. I think I understand the difference you are making. And I have to say again that I disagree. Of course wearing the hijab is her personal choice, still it's my personal choice to think it is wrong to do it as well as the reasons for it are absurd. And it is not entirely personal anyway as it is a signifier of a concept and ideals about society, not necessarily political but still a form of social conservatism or traditionalism that I abhor. Those are entirely sufficient reasons for harsh critique while leaving the context of Turkish politics aside. 

However I think she actually *is* a willing pawn in Erdogans larger game, his Neo-Ottoman authoritarian cronyism and so on... even if she didn't say so explicitly now but stuck to the religious freedom-rights script. Even if you imagine her somekind of liberal saint, she did what she did today as part of the Erdogan's game and adding legitimacy to his country wide policies. 

Of course I can conceive of hijab-wearing politicians and activists that are on my side (our side?) in the struggle for free expression, religious freedom a real liberal democracy and so on. And understand that it is necessary to allow women to wear the hijab in parliament and universities. But I still would harshly disagree with them in the question concerning the reasonableness of the hijab and its underlying obscurantist religious/cultural concept of shame and purity, the role of the female in society and so on. Also I still feel rather French about the Hijab in schools and everywhere were it is not so clear if it really is a free choice. 

Just because some choices people make are not forbidden or you can't forbid them doesn't mean they are good choices or that they are based on reasonable ideas. One might not be able to outlaw the opiate of the people, but the more important is it to criticise it. A lot of politics is culture, therefore culture becomes political. ","1383264226"

The idea is to argue that *even if* atheists gave less per capita, the abolition of religion would still be good, if there was a corresponding reformation of secular institutions.  In brief:

1. Charitable giving is good because it helps alleviate the suffering of vulnerable persons, such as the poor, women, children and immigrants.

2. Vulnerable persons are vulnerable largely because of a long tradition of discrimination and exploitation of and against those groups.

3. Religious institutions are traditionally involved in and support the continued discrimination against and exploitation of those groups, even while extolling the virtues of charitable giving.

4. Therefore, if religious institutions are abolished, there will be less need for charity.

5. It is, all things being equal, better for the need for charity to be reduced rather than charitable giving to increase.

6. Therefore, it is better, all things being equal, that religious institutions be abolished.

Of course, since the abolition of religious institutions is a pipe dream, atheists should still observe a general duty to give charitably.  Do not, however, let religious institutions off the hook for peddling a remedy while spreading the disease.  ","1383264227"

So...  Because you said its 75% then it has to do with the baking itself.  The center of the loaf isn't baking.  Hence the hole not going near the edges but straight through the center where the heat gets to last before the rest of the loaf. 

Suggestion...  Bake it longer at a higher temp.  You will have more of a crust, but that's a good thing.    

The maple syrup can cause bread to do funny things. I think this is because the type of sugar it is and because of how wet it is compared to other sources of sugar.

Personally, I think that's going a bit far. The exact situation is kind of irrelevant because I wasn't violent or particularly aggressive to this woman, beyond using harsh language.

If you must know the parking situation: the residents zone in front of her house is rarely (if ever) full. The zones (and non-zones) directly in front and opposite my house are nearly always full after about 7-8pm. I returned home at about 3am after working for 16 hours straight. I'd done this maybe 6-8 times in the month before and had to park in the residents zone opposite her house, never had I taken the last spot in that zone. Further, these are not dedicated spots, they're shared. Every single time I'd done this, she'd left a printed note saying YOU DON'T HAVE A PERMIT TO PARK HERE, despite me checking the council rules saying that I did. Sounds more like she's the shitty neighbour who doesn't know how to share.

I suspect her upset is because of the local student population. I happened to be a student at the time, but I also happen to own the house - her anger was misplaced with me.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My dad slumped over at the dinner table. Mid bite during a family dinner. 

We all thought he was joking about being tired and he just collapsed onto the ground. Even when he's sick and trying to be tough he's still honest, so when he passed in and out of consciousness saying ""I'm fine I just need to close my eyes."" We KNEW he was fucked. I just accepted in that moment he was gonna go. 

We called the ambulance and as I tried to keep him awake he'd say slipping in and out of it ""I'm sorry. I'm sorry."" Like between gasping breaths. ""I'm sorry I'm so..."" and then he just stopped....for a few minutes. 

Paramedics arrive and unconscious but breathing get him awake, calmly get him on a gurney and speed him off to the hospital telling us he'll be fine. Evidently it wasn't a stroke, so far as they could tell...though they didn't know immediately what was wrong. 

Feeling some sense of relief he's at least alive, I figure its a stroke and he's going to be forever changed. 

Worse still, my younger brother, who was busy doing his homework with his headphones on LOUD sitting in the neighbouring room heard nothing. Not the frantic calls of ""Dad wake up! Dad!"" Not the medics coming in. Only saw them as they were leaving. The look of confusion and terror in his eyes kills me still. Almost as bad as nearly losing my dad that day. 

The kicker...the fucking guy...my dad...had heat stroke. 

Turns out he'd been working outside all day, not drinking water, no hat, no food. Came in and sat down to a steak dinner and a glass of wine. The combo of food and alcohol shot blood everywhere but to his head and the reason he was in and out of consciousness. 

Its funny now, but man...fucking scary shit. The look of panic and loss on everyone in my families faces...our inability to react fast. Its was scary and paralyzing.

Johnny's fire control and power output far outclass Zuko, so I don't see Johnny being controlled as a problem.  Katara can only blood bend on full moons, and she has only ever done it in one episode because she is highly against it an it disgusts her; of everything you mentioned, blood bending is by far the least likely.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","India is the biggest obstacle to achieving this goal.  India gets in it's own way resulting in economic disasters such as the Rupee crash earlier this year.  Dishonesty and corruption are a constant problem.  We have a strong anti-corruption, 100% honesty policy at our company.  

India has a long history of being taken advantage of by outsiders.  Since 1505 India has been colonized by Portugal, Denmark, France, and England.    India has only been independent since 1947.  As a result India has a great distrust of foreign businesses.  There is a rampant fear that Westerners will use their economic power to dominate India.   Therefore India has strict rules against Foreign Direct Investment that don't exist in most modern countries.  These rules keep India deeply isolated and poor.  They have four times the population of the US but only 1/10 the economy.  It's a stunning failure and very, very sad.

For example, only Indians are permitted to own real estate in India.  Not even an India-incorporated company can buy real estate if it's even 1% foreign owned.  After the 2013 Rupee crash there is talk of relaxing some of the FDI rules but we'll see how that pans out.

This includes your friends and guild mates (unless they also become ""bad sports""). And any subsequent violations INCREASE the duration of the penalty (aka: four days, and so on).

The kicker? Destroying player-owned vehicles is also deemed ""bad sportsmanship"". Blow up too many player vehicles (which in a game with grenades, RPGs, tanks, etc. is *super* easy), and you get to go to the penalty box.","1383264244"

My main concern in terms of anti-Christian sentiment is that people are tied in and associated with events that they are not guilty of. The crusades, like we've established, have taken place 700 years ago. Witch trials also took place in a time frame where nobody alive today can possible be associated with them in a serious way. I think that in order to call criticism to Christianity, or any religion for that matter, it has to be done in practical terms based on group, time frame, reasoning, and compare their practices to biblical teachings. Allowing for sweeping generalizations based on the word ""Christian"" as an umbrella term only promotes ignorance.","1383264245"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Worked at a telemarketing company for 7 years as IT Manager. There are too many great stories to list so I'll just keep it short to just a couple of short stories......

Occassionally we would have the telemarketers answer the call and speak like Darth Vadar. Even saw a sale happen this way. The caller never even said anything about the weird breathing.

They liked to play games for cash. One called ""The Dead Pool"" every time you got a sale you got to guess the age and what killed the person from our obituary clippings from the past couple days from the newspaper. If you got it right, $100.

My ALL time favorite was a prank on the Call Center Manager. On the wall behind his desk he had a black and white picture of his family, it was just above his head when you were sitting across from him at his desk. This happens to be where he interviewed new applicants and such. We replaced that black and white picture with another black and white picture of a naked black man, barely covered in a white sheet, on the picture it said ""Sexual Healing"". The picture was there for at least 5 months before he found out, and that was only when an interviewee spilled the beans. Ahh.. Long fuse pranks are the best.

Same thing with Bush's unfunded tax cuts for the rich (while conducting an unfunded war, no less), which were in theory time-limited, but which the [current ""Conservatives"" made permanent](http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&amp;id=3880). In my world, real Conservatives care about lowering the deficit first, and then try to lower taxes if possible.

See fx the debt ceiling showdown, which was supposedly about the deficit, where the Conservative demands were for things which would raise the deficit, such as repealing the medical devices tax. Or even the demand to repeal Obamacare, even though [Obamacare is $200 billion budget-positive over 10 years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obamacare#Federal_deficit). That is not fiscally Conservative!

Or take the farm bill. While the ""Conservatives"" do want to cut the food stamp part of the farm bill, the same Conservatives want to spend MORE on farm subsidies than Obama suggested. The so-called Conservatives in Congress don't care about small government as much as they care about funneling money to the rich.","1383264247"

That's a very easy way for employers to be able to push their own morals onto their employees, fucking asinine in the extreme.

And guess, what, if they're *paying the bill*, then they have every right to decide what they offer, if they offer anything at all.  If the employee doesn't like it, he can choose other work or get private insurance.  No one is forcing him to take the employer's offer.

If it *really* pisses the employees off, they can band together and all leave at once, screwing the employer over hard core.  This is how unions are supposed to work.  The employees negotiate with the employer; government doesn't need to get involved.","1383264248"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","Here's my view as both a player playing a Musket Master and a DM with a Pistolero/Mysterious stranger.

Musket Master: Only way to play with a musket. However unless you invest feats it becomes useless to use a pistol as all your abilities only work off 2-H firearms. Deals decent damage but clearing your gun after a misfire sucks.

DM: If your player rolls ~~good~~ average they will hit most creatures. Be prepared as most high level monsters have low touch AC. Also don't allow advanced firearms. Reload times are too fast and unless you build a campaign around firearms they will hit everything you throw at them.

Things to remember:
Early Firearms - Hits touch AC in the 1st range increment (Certain skills will push this further out) and max of 5 range increments

Advanced Firearms - Hits touch AC out to 5 range increments, Max of 10 range increments.

Overall it's a fun class but it can be difficult on a GM to build appropriate encounters that will challenge both them and the rest of the party appropriately. One thing that keeps them in check early on is the cost of ammo. Keep track of that.","1383264255"

An STi hatchback comes to mind, as does the Magnum SRT8.

You don't need to worry too much about handling since it's going to be 99.9% straight highway  Let's stretch that a little bit and now you can make the trip with only one fuel stop.

Same exact show just streamed in different qualities, if I understand the question correctly :) So if I have Google Fiber and I'm streaming 4k video (Netflix is going to support this) and you're in a hotel on junky dial up we'd both be able to stream the same movie at the same time, I'd just have a clearer picture. The problem is at first Netflix figures out your bandwidth and basically adjusts the quality, and that's when it may buffer for a couple of seconds. Luckily we check for that and make sure all the streams are in sync even if people buffer to adjust quality to start!

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; If you took all the matter in the universe and converted it into energy, then used that energy in a computer that is more efficient than we believe is physically possible according to the laws of the universe, you would still not likely be able to break a single modern high-quality encryption key.

This is true for 512 bit keys, it is almost true for 256 bit keys, but it is definitely not true for 128 bit keys.

A common way to judge the difficulty in brute forcing a key is to look at how much energy would be required to iterate over the key space based on the [Landauer's principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle).

If we assume the computer is operating at room temperature and at the highest efficiency possible then minimum energy required to iterate over all n bit keys is 2^n * k * T * ln 2 = 2^n * 2.87 * 10^-21.

For each key size:  
128 bits = 9.76 * 10^17 J  
256 bits = 3.32 * 10^56 J  
512 bits = 3.85 * 10^133 J  

According to [this table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\(energy\)) the mass-energy of the observable universe is 4*10^69 joules.  So both AES-128 and AES-256 are breakable in your scenario.  128 bit keys are vulnerable to a perfect computer with as much energy as the yearly electrical consumption of south korea.","1383264263"

"technology","t5_2qh16","&gt;Beginning in 2009 and continuing through March 2011, when Haletown, Tennessee received service from EPB's fiber optic network, EPB began to establish its exclusive fiber optic network to its 600 square miles (1,600 km2) service area, which covers the greater Chattanooga Metropolitan Statistical Area. In September 2010, EPB became the first municipally-owned utilities company in the United States to offer internet access directly to the public at speeds up to one gigabit per second by utilizing its fiber optics network. The fiber optic network has been emulated by at least six other cities in Tennessee and studied by other cities in the US and even internationally. Jay Weatherill, South Australia's Premier, visited Chattanooga in January 2012 and ""looked at the current gigabit network that was supporting critical city safety functions such as police and fire communications infrastructure, equipment and applications. He also inspected wastewater management, storm water management, traffic control and medical diagnostics applications [and] first-hand operations of a smart lighting and camera system that allows the police to control public lighting and see what is happening in heavy crime areas. [The article says the] use of broadband to carry the video and control signaling has contributed to making Chattanooga’s Coolidge Park a safer place to visit.""

&gt;In 2011 the expansion of EPB's network became a subject of major controversy in Tennessee. The success of its network, credited with the expansion of Volkswagen's Chattanooga plant and the establishment of Amazon.com facilities in Chattanooga and Cleveland, led to a number of legal challenges by AT&amp;T and Comcast insisting that public funds not be used to fund expansion of public networks in competition with private ones. However, according to EPB itself, federal agencies, electricity industry trade sources, and other press sources, the investment in the fully fiber optic network is justified by electrical system benefits alone, including early fault detection and decreases in standby power.

Then give the FCPS Transportation office a call (I'd be happy to get you the number) and voice your concern with them.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","&gt; The sheer complexity of trillions and trillions of base pairs of amino acids coming together for billions of different organisms by chance is just ludicrous to imagine. 

Well, it doesnt happen by chance. Genes started very simple and coded for just a few structures and gradually became more complex, leading to complex function. 

&gt; It's like thinking that you could take all of the pieces to a high quality watch, putting them in a bag, shaking it up for millions and billions (and I'm guessing soon to come, trillions) of years and expecting a fully formed watch to come out. For me, the true ""jaw on the floor moment"" 

Not at all. Biochemistry is based on carbon, which has 8 valence electrons, granting it the ability to produce a huge number of complex biopolymers by way of sharing those valence electrons with other atoms. 
Your example of the watch would be correct if you added ""the parts of the watch also snap together in the correct way on contact when the parts are exposed to eachother"".

You have to make it abundantly clear that it's not the State's current involvement that has made the system ""absolutely amazing"", comparatively. Rather, it is the ground norms that underlie an anarcho-capitalistic social order (namely private property) that are well understood to make conflict-free and mutually beneficial interaction possible enabling tremendous increases in wealth and unprecedented prosperity. So what is amazing is that a great rise in standards of living occurred despite disruptive, destructive, and retarding forces of coercive intervention in the marketplace.

&gt; Andrew Goossen: We've chosen to let title developers make the trade-off of resolution vs. per-pixel quality in whatever way is most appropriate to their game content. A lower resolution generally means that there can be more quality per pixel. With a high-quality scaler and antialiasing and render resolutions such as 720p or '900p', some games look better with more GPU processing going to each pixel than to the number of pixels; others look better at 1080p with less GPU processing per pixel.

My man knew I was bisexual, and so encouraged me to explore with other ladies. I ended up hitting it off extremely well with a girl we started hanging out with. They got along really well too. We were all best friends, I just got some extra benefits to it ;). 

Well one night we all went out and got a little drunk. When we got back, the girl and I were cuddling and flirting, and I invited my man over. We had already had threesomes with other girls before and I knew he was attracted to her (and her him) so I encouraged them to kiss. Things went from there and we had probably the best sex I've had to date.

Also, gloves, they won't stop a bite but they just bump your confidence up so so much, then when you're comfy able enough take off the glove.
Also, when he's out of his hide/cave, just put something in front of it so he can't go back in, then let him climb up all wall to get out with some gentle persuasion and straight onto your hand.
It can be very scary at first but stay calm, keep him very close to to floor incase you get nervous and drop him, the last thing you want is to damage him.
If you're jumpy and nervousness then it's best to just leave it until you're not, the spider will not like the fast movements and will get stressed and scared.

There are paedophiles out there who have recognised their problem and taken steps as far as volunteering themselves for chemical castration.  So you can argue that those people aee actually good people worthy of commendation.  In my opinion we should clearly punish cases of actual child molestation,  but treat paedophilia itself as a mental illness.  These people cant help being born with this issue, so we should really encourage them to seek help without fear of vilification,  only bringing down the hammer if they act on their urges.","1383264280"

My bank statement says I have $40 less in my account than my ledger says I should have.  I went through all of my transactions trying to find the discrepancy.  I eventually found a $48 transaction I forgot to note, but that doesn't make any sense either!  My fiancee keeps telling me to ignore it and just use the bank website, and doesn't think it matters that the bank can take several days to note the checks I have to write to pay our rent and water bill.  It matters to me, but I apparently I'm too stupid to keep my own ledger.

I've been waiting for a return email from one of my grad school professors regarding a kind of important question.  I'm pretty sure he's just not going to email me back.  I've had more than one indication that he doesn't like me.  Normally I could just avoid dealing with him, but he's the only faculty member in my specialization with tenure, which means he's the only faculty member who can serve as my thesis advisor.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Humid

From: tkim@lynx.dac.neu.edu (Tae H Kim)
Subject: Hot, humid, bloody
Date: 1 Jul 1995 15:26:25 GMT

Greetings a.t.'ers - old and new!

My sincerest apologies for not posting for quite some time. But, as luck
would have it, I have a few minutes to spare, and have successfully
dislocated my wrist enough so that I can wriggle one arm out my
straight-jacket and type. Bear with me.

Fitchburg, Massachusetts.

The 'hilliest' city in the United States - sorry San Francisco. You want
hills - Fitchburg's got 'em. Another mill town victim of the
post-industrial textile decline and the lack of major highway access.
How sad. 

My tour starts off with the usual diff breathers and heroin overdoses.
Not much to 'em, really. The hot, humid summer night, with no breeze to
speak of, is usually an indicator of multiple responses for asthmatics,
and people with chronic bronchitis and emphysema. We arrive usually to
find some variation of the same theme: elderly, overweight - the women
wearing faded pink polyester house coats with food stains of various
ages; the men wearing undershirts gone grey with concentric circles of
dried and re-dried sweat-stains radiating from their arm-pits. 

You find them sitting in the kitchen or the living room, hunkered over
rusty card-tables, using all their chest and _neck_ muscles to draw in a
deeper breath. The floor is littered with empty medication inhalers,
greasy paper plates, cups, newspapers. Every cup and dish in the place
is filled-to-overflowing with cigarette butts. Most of the time, if they
have cats, they have _many_ cats. I once started counting the number of
cats in a woman's apartment, and stopped at ten. The place was literally
_crawling_ with cats. With so many cats, it gets to be kind of a pain to
change the litter-box. So the cats shit all over the floor, and a new
layer of newspaper gets placed on top of the old. Ever enter an
apartment  with a floor that's uneven and lumpy - and 'squishes' when
you walk over it? Take my advice: don't lift up the edge of the
newspaper - you won't have to pay for lunch again. But I digress.

They've usually run out of their medication, or are sucking the last
puffs of it from their inhaler like it was goddamn mother's milk.
Everyone's sweating like crazy - me and my partner, 'cause our uniform's
made of the same shit as Saran Wrap, the firefighters, 'cause they're
too fucking stupid to take off their turn-out coats, the patient, 'cause
it maximizes their 'digusto quotient' and makes my job that much more
*pleasant*.

Tea and crumpets? I think not.

Trying to put cardiac monitor electrodes on wet skin simply doesn't
happen. The damn things always seem to slip off at the worst times.
Using tincture of benzoin - which makes even wet skin sticky, works some
of time. But sometimes the 'trode will come off anyway - with a nice
layer of dead, grey, benzoin-coated skin. Next bright idea?

We give up trying to get a decent tracing - it's just not worth it.
'Sides, that abberrant cardiac rhythm we briefly saw was there before we
were born. We hope.

Give 'em a little oxygen, start an IV, and administer a nebulized
bronchodilator, and they're good to go. 

'Needle and 'neb - that's all we do.

The heroin overdoses are pretty much the same: some guy in a back-alley,
or in some flop-house, found unconscious with his 'works' in a sloppy
pile next to him. Some people get pretty fancy with their 'works' - bent
spoon with a lighter taped to the handle, etc, but most people
eventually get too fucked-up to care. Your standard 'works' assortment:

- bent spoon
- disposable lighter
- alcohol swab
- insulin syringe

Once I had a guy come up to me and ask me for a 'clean needle' - 'cause
his was 'dirty'. Where are we - in fucking Amsterdam? So, I take his
tiny, little insulin needle, reach into my equipment bag, and pull out
the longest, biggest needle I could find - four inches long and about
the thickness of a pencil-lead, and give it to him. Hey, what the fuck -
it was sterile. But again, I digress.

It's the same old story: you show up and and there's some guy with
pinpoint pupils snoring away. You note the scarred criss-cross of veins
on each arm - hardened and dark from the caustic injections and site
infections, and count yourself lucky if you find some tiny vein between
his thumb and forefinger. You start an IV; and before you 'push' the
meds through the IV to reverse the overdose, you give a coupla' mgs of
the stuff intramuscularly. Otherwise, if you push the IV meds first,
you'll end up wrestling with the guy to give him the shot in the arm -
all the while denying he took anything; that he isn't a heroin user;
that yeah - sometimes he passes out in back-alleys and pisses himself
for no apparent reason - what the fuck's it to 'ya? He denies that
that's *his* bent spoon and needle that you're dumping into a bio-hazard
box; all the while looking at it longingly as you close the cover. The
scarred veins? 'Old accident.' Sure, pal. I've heard it all. Just shut
the fuck up.

That was the extent of it for most of the evening. That is, until we got
a call for a 'suicide attempt with a knife'. 

All the way to the call, my partner and I bitch about the heat, the
paperwork that's piling up, the lack of a decent air conditioner, the
heat. We arrive just after the fire department. Several police cruisers
are parked outside of an apartment complex. We walk towards several cops
standing near their cruisers. The sergeant looks over and sees us - he
tells us that some guy slashed his own arm and was bleeding heavily. 

I turn to the entrance of the apartment building, and notice a large,
congealing puddle of blood on the front steps. No patient.

""Sarge - where's the patient?"" I ask.

""He's still up in his apartment.""

""Did someone notice him walking around outside and call you guys?""

""Nah - he called it in himself - fucking pussy.""

""Uh, so if he never left his apartment, why is there a big puddle of
blood _outside_?""

The cop just points to the third floor - and I see a man holding his arm
outside an apartment window. I look carefully at the puddle on the first
floor - every so often drops of blood fall from the man's arm and lands
in the puddle. I now see that the outer edges of the blood puddle are
darker and congealed; while the center of the puddle is brighter and
still liquid. Silly me, what was I thinking?

The walk up three flights of stairs is slow and tiring. At every
landing, apartment doors are slightly ajar; with eyes peering out. The
smell of paella; the sound of blaring TV sets; crying babies; the
occasional screaming-match - all from behind these doors. When I reach
the third floor, I am *completely* drenched in sweat. The tight weave of
the polyester monkey-suit I wear doesn't permit my sweat to evaporate,
so I stew in my own juices. I can actually feel beads of sweat running
down my leg - only to be absorbed by my socks. It's too damn hot.

I also grade homework based on effort, not answers. Do you grade homework? So if a kid doesn't do homework but aces all his tests, does he still get an A? Not in my class. That's not how life works, sorry. Your boss isn't going to let you slide without doing the paperwork even if you get the ""right"" answer.

2) government has an interest in the welfare of the future of its tax payers.

Congress has the congressional research service that files reports and there are numerous think tanks in DC who are staffed by professional academics and policy analysts who have regular contact with elected officials. I doubt most Americans read the pro/cons section on their mail in ballots for every single proposition or issue they are voting on, I doubt they would be willing to read thousands of pages of dense reports to have an educated opinion on the economy or Afghanistan. At least with a few hundred elected officials there is a better chance of this knowledge being disseminated. ","1383264292"

"danielmiessler","t5_2yxxh","Don't run SSH on a different port than 22 because it's a good IOC for egress network traffic.

Better would be to only ALLOW traffic from a specific src port on a specific IP. SSH usage for ALL business purposes is ALWAYS an HBI asset, as is RDP and pretty much every console and every web portal that has a login, especially with identity-tied authentication. HBI assets often require port-to-port and not just IP-to-IP firewall/ACL/routing rules management. There may exist a huge policy gap in many information management programs with regards to this topic. Note that many business/IT/Ops policies dictate many other things about SSH and/or RDP (and do usually fail to mention consoles and IT/Ops administration / privileged account web portals).

Yes, there is always exceptions management, so if you do have a ""business need"" to run SSH on a different port than 22, having that documentation in the exceptions management process could feed the responders during an incident when non-standard, egress SSH traffic is found to be a potential IOC. When suggesting good security practices, it often makes sense to describe them in policy, audit, risk, legal, analytic, and other appropriate business terminologies.

The obscurity part of your argument I do agree with, as you clearly know where to draw the line. Not too many people are Daniel Miessler, though.  Most should just probably ask you where those gray areas exist. Maybe that's a future blog post?

I make my way to the right apartment by following the crackle of
portable radios. I enter the apartment - several cops are milling
inside, all talking about their pending divorces. I recognize a couple
of them, and nod as I make my way past them and into the bedroom where
someone is shouting incoherently. My guess is that's the patient. 

There's the guy alright - still holding his arm out the window. Still
bleeding like crazy. I pause a moment to take in the entire room: cheesy
brown carpet littered with long-empty bottles of beer - again filled
with cigarette butts and an almost-black liquid slurry of ashes and flat
beer. There's an equally impressive-sized puddle of blood in the middle
of the carpet. The walls have blood spattered over them in lazy
horizontal lines - as if the guy had stood in the center of the room,
held his bleeding arm out, and spun around in a circle several times.
The most impressive thing was the mirror over the headboard of the bed.
A large, rectangular mirror, with the words ""My girlfriend's a fucking
whore. I hate her,"" - presumably written by the man by dipping his
fingers in his own blood and smearing it on the mirror. Correct spelling
and punctuation - I'm impressed.

Finally, I walk over to the man - who's still shouting something about
his girlfriend, and tell him to shut the fuck up so I can look at his
arm. He thrusts his almost entirely red arm towards me, forcefully
enough for several drops of blood to spatter on my shoe, as if he were
proud of his achievement. Looking at the wound, I must say _I_ was
impressed: a clean, four-inch cut _across_ the bend of his arm. It
looked pretty deep, too, as I could clearly see layers of fat and tendon
in the wound. From the elbow down, his arm was paler than the rest of
him. I felt his hand - cool to the touch. No circulation.

I tried to stauch the flow of blood by taking a large piece of gauze and
pressing down _hard_ over the wound. Within seconds the white gauze
turned red and was soaked through. Time to get creative. Pulling a
blood-pressure cuff from my bag, I first place several more layers of
gauze over the wound, then wrapped the cuff over that. I inflated the
cuff until the needle of the pressure gauge almost reached the 300 mm Hg
mark. It slowed the bleeding a bit - but not by much. Time to go.

""My fucking girlfriend - this'll show her,"" he told me; his speech
slurred with booze and blood-loss.

""Uh - what?"" I asked, trying to navigate him from the bedroom into the
living room.

""I did this to punish _her_, man. She fucked around on me."" 

""Okay, I see, you're punishing her, but you're the one that's bleeding.
Hmm.""

""She'll think twice about doing that to me again, man."" 

The logic escapes me.

As we passed through the living room, I glanced into kitchen, and saw a
stringy-looking woman smoking a cigarette while talking in tired, hushed
tones to a cop. As we passed-by, she gave a quick glance to the man, who
was still obviously proud of what he'd accomplished. Her eyes showed no
concern for him; only a relief that he was finally leaving the
apartment. 

I led him down the stairs to the waiting ambulance, where my partner had
already set up two  IV's. We started both of them, and I was working on
a third, when we pulled into the hospital ambulance bay. We wheeled him
into one of the trauma rooms. A surgeon came in to examine the wound. 

After removing the cuff, the layers of gauze were peeled back. It began
to bleed freely again - this time a translucent pink flow emerged. 

""Shit, this guy has more saline than blood in him. Type and cross a
couple of units for him - stat.""

I walked out into the humid night, to help my partner restock the
ambulance. The back of the ambulance was a mess - bloody gauze, gloves,
towels. The floor of the ambulance had zig-zagged line of blood; each
change in direction an indicator of a left or right turn. Shit. 

""You know what?"" my partner asked.

""No, tell me.""

""We could really use a working air conditioner back here.""

""I hear that.""

After calling in-service, we drove to the Dairy Queen to get
raspberry-lime rickeys. God, the line was long...

"Nujabes","t5_2skx3","I think he has a unique style of rapping that is quite different than the styles we are accustomed to hearing to, namely rappers from the West. Personally, I was at first thrown off by his style of rapping, as well as his voice. But over time, I came to appreciate his style. I'm no longer bothered by his voice, and what really stands out to me is his lyrics. The man is a poetic genius. Take Luv sic part 6. He spits poetry right from the start: ""I met a metaphorical girl in a metaphyiscal world."" That's a play on the word meta, and it uses alliteration as well. 

Granted, Shing02 did go to UC Berk for college, and I'm pretty sure he's spent quite some time in the states. But I think his sense of style very much stems from his Japanese upbringing. One thing I've noticed is that rappers from different countries really do, for some reason, sound different from American rappers. Check out the song [400](http://youtu.be/w9S2vmYWLE0) by him. He raps in Japanese and I must say, he's pretty slick. Hopefully that will change your mind. For a more Nujabes-ish song, check out [I Miss You Remix](http://youtu.be/60qiz2uFBcs). In that song he also raps in Japanese.

That's just my opinion though. ","1383264299"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","The Al-Andalus that is thought of in these terms--that is, the ""Ornament of the World""--lasted only a brief period relative to the seven centuries of Islam in Spain.  That period is (roughly) from the beginning of Umayyad rule in 756 to the dissolution of the Caliphate of Cordoba in 1009...well, the caliphate still existed til 1031, but it ceased to have unquestioned rule over Al-Andalus in about 1009.  After that period, the petty-kingdoms (*taifas*) that dotted Spain were pretty weak, so the ""golden age"" of strength and unity was over.  However, your question was specifically about tolerance (presumably religious tolerance), and that seems to have continued through the taifa period, until the invasion of the conservative Almoravids in 1086.  Those fundamentalists saw the scientific, philosophical, tolerant Andalusians as heretical and curbed their ""excess"".

Now, just how true and extensive was this ""tolerance""?  It certainly existed: Jews and Christians were able to worship, trade, and create wealth and raise families largely unmolested during the period of the caliphate.  There were certainly limits: in 855, a group of zealous Christians in Cordoba actively sought martyrdom (they saw the Christians as too accommodating of Muslim culture and wanted to spur revolt against their ""pagan"" rulers) by openly blaspheming Muhammad.  This, of course, *was* unacceptable to the authorities, and about fifty were executed.  Most Cordoban Christians just went about their lives though (and Christian leaders tried to keep the blasphemy from occurring), because their lives were generally good, and they saw no reason for uprising.  

In some instances, non-Muslims even acquired powerful political posts, perhaps the most famous and powerful of which was Samul HaNagid, who was the Jewish grand vizier of the emir of Granada during the taifa period.  He was a warrior, a financier, and a poet (he wrote poems about his military exploits, and saw himself as a ""second David"").  The other side of the coin (intolerance) is epitomized in the life of his son, Joseph, who succeeded him as vizier.  Joseph's reign was despised by the local Muslims, who saw him as wasteful and taking advantage of his position to give power to Jews, and died in a mob uprising.  

To some extent, this tolerance (wherein religious minorities can live unmolested so long as they are subservient and respectful) remained in place in Christian Spain, at least for some time.  The Fourth Lateran Council of 1215 ordered Christian rulers to legislate unique dress for their Jewish and Muslim residents, but that rule (and others) often went ignored or underenforced in the Iberian kingdoms for some time.  However, according to David Nirenberg ([Communities of Violence](http://books.google.com/books/about/Communities_of_Violence.html?id=eET4HN9yodQC)), sexual boundaries between religions were strongly enforced, though the requisite execution was often commuted.  In Iberia, tolerance was, to some extent, merely pragmatic.  There were so many Jews and Christians in Muslim Spain, and so many Jews and Muslims in Christians Spain, that society and the economy could be severely disadvantaged by extreme proscription of minority religious practice.  

Spain is well remembered for its banishment of Jews in 1492, but it is important to remember that it was one of the *last* nations in western Europe to do so (Portugal did so in 1496).  It is also well remembered for the Inquisition, which is misremembered as attacking Jews and Muslims, whereas in reality it was instituted to root out *false converts* from Judaism and Islam to Christianity.  These things are only tangentially related to your question, but they're common misunderstandings that I thought I'd quickly address.


In short, I would say the tolerance of Al-Andalus is *not* a myth, though some like to raise it up as a perfect society.  It was certainly a society with tensions, and one that did not last long (though the intolerances often came from outside--Almoravids/Almohads, papal decrees, Frankish crusaders), but religious minorities found themselves in unusually good circumstances in the Cordoban Caliphate.

Most of this comes from Maria Rosa Menocal's [The Ornament of the World](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Ornament_of_the_World.html?id=4dxbqEmU-OkC), though I undoubtedly drew facts from her [Arts of Intimacy](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3896071-the-arts-of-intimacy), R.I. Moore's [Formation of a Persecuting Society](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Formation_of_a_Persecuting_Society.html?id=L1eIIRg39sgC) and others.","1383264302"
"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","For a few years while I was in high-school the group of guys I had to cube-draft with would always go out to a 24 hour diner on the outskirts of town that had great coffee and would serve us alcohol (they never ID'd me either) until the wee hours of the morning. We'd grab a few booths near the back and run the draft twice from midnightish until 6:30-7:00 when we all had to go to work/school. Couple times a week too, and we would test there for PTQs/GPs because they had more available room than any of us did at our houses. It was great and we loved it, and we would have continued going there had they not gone out of business.

Being able to buy food and drink at whim was really convenient, and we made sure to all tip 40-50% for these guys keeping our drinks topped up and coffee always brewed for 6-8 hours multiple times per week. It really is too bad that they closed down on us. =P

That anecdote was a little longer than I intended, sorry, but perhaps that's an example of restaurant service done right.

My thoughts on your situation:

* The issue with limited tournaments is the fact that you'll never be able to buy packs for the same price an LGS can. You'll have to buy them at their markup, then resell them with additional markup if you wish to run this at a profit. Not assuming you do, but do keep in mind you don't have access to wholesale prices.

* Yes.

* MtG is considered a game of skill under the law, ircc, so cash prizes shouldn't be an issue. You, of course, live somewhere different than myself so your situation could be different. I could also be talking out of my ass.","1383264302"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","No, upon reflection, I'd have though Bush could easily get re-elected.  The wars weren't horrifically unpopular by 2004, the tax cut was popular, the economy wasn't bad enough, and the opposition put forward a farcical candidate.  That one wasn't clearly in the bag for either side.

2016?  2020?  I mean, I guess that's some time for change, but I don't see Republicans meaningfully drifting away from the religious right in that time.  As such, young people (such as myself) will not vote for them.  I'm sorry.  I think Democrats have terrible, unsustainable, ideas wrapped in liberal tears, which makes them appealing to my generation, but I think they're wrong about domestic and economic policy.  I think the Republicans are nearer to the truth on those matters, but I can't in good faith vote for a Republican and sleep at night.  They *ARE* batshit crazy, they are leashed by the balls by a theocratic constituency, and they have no meaningful ideas.

I hope that'll change, I really, really do.  But that religious voting bloc is *big*.  And it's not going to die off in ten years.  Twenty might diminish it to a size that's more competitive, but ten years many of these folks *will* still be voting.  The trouble is, they're not enough.  They alone are not enough to catapult Republicans to victory, and the only other political factions willing to vote for Republicans (Libertarians and Independents) are immediately soured by pandering to the social theocrats.

The Republicans are oddly representative of two, diametrically-opposed factions of conservatism.  While Libertarians are gaining ground, they have a long, long, long, *long* way to go before they unseat the likes of Bill Donohue and James Dobson.","1383264310"

I warded his jungle right off the bat and spent some time harassing him in the jungle during the laning phase. Once the laning phase was over, I tried to keep my eyes on wherever he was going and I would then go after him, or cut the creeps in the lane he was pushing. 

Spirit Breaker was threatening to completely derail my game, but once I got the Linkens up he became a mere minor annoyance.

Needless to say, I got *great* satisfaction from this match after completely shutting down the NP.

In this case, it seems (and I would gather) that what began as a term for infants slowly became associated with things that we care deeply about/are protective of/are deeply invested in.  The word baby probably came into use as a term of endearment in reference to how cherished/deeply love the subject was, not in reference to any kind of immaturity, baby-like qualities.

"Multicopter","t5_2u9hy","I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I don't think it's very practical, especially for your miniscule budget.

First of all, you'd have to write some kind of software for a microcontroller that would basically replicate what a $30 flight controller would do, only you'd have to code a Bluetooth interface on top of that using some unspecified protocol (I suppose Serial). That's easily a couple of months work full time to get something reliable and usable. Then you'd have to use a $700 iPhone with custom software to relay commands from 3G (unreliable and high latency) to Bluetooth. Then you'd have to use another $700 iPhone and more time writing a control app for your ground station phone.

That still doesn't answer a lot of questions, for example, what happens if the Bluetooth connection drops out, do the motors just stop? What happens if the 3G connection drops out and you're headed for a building / group of people / body of water? You're setting yourself up for failure unless you have a lot of background knowledge and free time. I'm a software development manager for a living and I wouldn't touch that project.

On the other hand, you could use a $200 ArduPilot, a $60 Transmitter with $40 worth of modules and receivers and have a fully GPS tracked quadcopter with perfect remote control.","1383264321"

This is a most common problem with not just eGos but other battery mods as well.

The vivi-nova works probably because it's center pin is lower than the one on the protank, possibly it has pushed it down out of reach of the protank's pin.

You could also try pulling out the protank center pin a bit, but be careful you don't pull it right out.

Sorry, Julia, but for such mundane - yet, tasteless conditions such as
an Upper Respiratory Infection, one must consult a physician ... Sonya?

As far as I can recall, the influenza virus, which causes colds, comes
in so many different strains that 1) catching a cold is quite easy,
since you cannot possibly produce anitbodies for _all_ strains, since
mutations occur constantly, 2) When dead antibodies accumulate, they're
expelled from the body in the form of mucus. 

The copius production of mucus could be attributed to a well-adjusted
immune system working overtime. Environmental factors should not be
overlooked, as cold, dry air helps in drying the nasal passages, which
in turn produce more mucus to coat it's lining.

Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

: Wish me well in my quest for tastelessness.

Always.

ObT: Over the weekend, two dead bodies were discovered in the city of
Lowell, MA. As my partner and I were driving around the city, looking
for the 'ultimate' donut, a '10-53' - 'dead body' call went out over the
air. Having nothing better to do, we signed-on and told the disptacher
that we'd go over to 'check things out.' The body was discovered near a
local breakfast place, where I swear they serve the most dangerous
breakfast sandwiches - grilled hamburger bun topped with a scrambled
egg, ham, bacon, and sausage, *plus* home-fries. The 'Three-Meat Boot
Mill' sandwich. Deadly. But I digress.

A large crowd had spilled out of the normally filled to capacity
restaraunt once the discovery had been made, so my partner took the
opportunity to go inside and place an order for both us - only to
discover that the cook was outside too, observing the scene. Apparently,
the unseasonably warm weather lately melted enough snow off the body for
someone to recognise it and call the cops. The body was at the bottom of
a recently drained river, some fifty feet below any surface roads, so
recovering it proved to be challenge. When the fire department finally
got to the body and flipped it over onto it's back, a small gasp and
murmurs errupted from the crowd, as all they'd been able to see prior
was a vague snow-covered back. Forty-ish year-old male, and by the looks
of the way the head lolled to-and-fro as they loaded it onto a Stokes
(chicken-wire) basket to haul up, he'd probably broken his neck.

As a winch slowly raised the basket up to the watching crowd, I noticed
that both his wrists were fractured - possibly an indication that the
man had been conscious as he fell, and tried to 'brace' his fall with
his outstretched arms, resulting in the bilateral fractures as he
impacted. His face was slightly bloated, and a mottled blue, but the
cold environment prevented the formation of gasses in the body, leaving
his features relatively intact and bearable to look at.

The murmur rose in volume as the body got closer to the crowd. Several
late-comers crossed the yellow-taped 'police-line' to try and get a
better look. My partner and I were standing at the edge of the
riverbank with a full view of the proceedings - to the envy of the rest
of the crowd. 

'Hey,' I said to the crowd, half-jokingly, 'you can stand here with us -
but it'll cost you a dollar.'

The dollar bills began to wave at me from the front row. Sick fucks.

The other body discovered that day was at the end of a dead-end alley.
Again, the warm weather and recent rain storms helped uncover it from
it's snowy blanket. Another crew was responded to the call with us, and
as we stood there while having a cigarette, waiting for the cops to
arrive, one of the newer guys pointed out the 'scratches' on the man's
face.

""He must've been in a fight or something,"" he ventured.

""Nah. You see how regularly shaped the scratches are - almost
triangular?""

""Yeah?""

""Those are from rats getting a little snack.""

The boy blanched and decided to wait in the truck, while the rest of us
remained in the alley. It was a hell of a nice day.

He is still with her and I don't know if she knows or has any clue, but if I were to talk to her I would try to convince her to dump him.  There were times he would have my scent on his hands, breath and I would suggest he should wash his hands or brush his teeth and he refused.  It seemed like he may have taken some joy in exposing her to me.  I still don't fully understand it.

He said he loved her.  Maybe he does, I don't know.  I am sure he has convinced her that he does, but that is not the kind of love a person deserves.  Especially not someone like her who bent over backwards for him.  

I don't doubt that he would do it again if the opportunity came to him no matter how sorry he could claim to be.

[Okay, maybe I'm still riding high after attending last night's game.  The atmosphere was electric, and I've never been more excited to be a Kings fan.  Our future looks bright.]

I think there are 5 sure-thing locks for playoff spots in the West:  San Antonio, Golden State, LA Clippers, Memphis, and Houston.  

There is a big group of teams that can fight for the last 3 slots: Dallas, Denver, New Orleans, Minnesota, Portland and Utah.  

My question is - Why can't the Kings compete with those 6 other teams?  

As it stands, I have the Kings slotted for 40 wins, good for 10th in the West.  If Demarcus played like he did last night for most of the season, they're easily good for 5-8 more wins.  That puts them in the playoffs.  

It wont be an easy road, but I think people are undervaluing the kings this year.  ","1383264342"

Congestion is also under the control of blood vessels. If the blood vessels around your sinuses expand (or become inflamed due to infection or allergies) then the mucus membranes in there leak more fluid into your nose where it mixes with other stuff (the protein mucin controls consistency) to become mucus. If the blood vessels contract, then mucus production stops.

Ejaculation sends a powerful pulse through your sympathetic nervous system and leaves it abuzz with activity. Blood vessels throughout your body constrict, causing your erection to deflate and stay that way for a while so people take a break. This is called a refractory period, and during this time your nose won't be able to make much mucus either leading to clear sinuses.","1383264343"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yeah, but just because you're convinced of that, doesn't mean that's how everybody around you feels. Which is why it's selfish, to an extent. You're making an assumption about a lot of people; a lot of people that you mean more than you know to. You're making that assumption and then making a very consequential decision from it.

I know that every situation is different, but many times there is a selfish side to it. I really don't like using the word selfish to describe it, because it strikes me as talking ill of the deceased, but it can be selfish. I guess i'd rather call it ignorant, because you overlook how many people you're really going to affect with your decision, then completely disregard how those people actually feel about you.","1383264347"

Source - Sound Card&gt;Oldish Yamaha Receiver

Type - Over-ear, open-backed

Isolation - Isolation not needed

Tonal Balance - Fairly neutral or balanced. My KRKs were my first headphones and the recessed but accurate bass pleased me as it didn't overpower any other sounds. I've had my 558s for a few weeks now and I loved the sound at first and the additional bass over my KRKs, but they are too warm I guess? They are much more emphasized on the lower end than I would like. Now my Grados I love. They're brighter than my other pairs and has that just-there bass. For listening sessions I prefer the Grado sound, but they're not as comfortable as I would like and are on-ear. It's gotten to the point where I still prefer my Grados for my electronic music over my 558s, that seems weird to me.

Past Headphones - Currently own KRK KNS-6400s, Sennheiser HD558s, and Grado sr60is

Music - Classic Rock, Electronic/Dance, Indie Rock. Some examples are The Decemberists, Florence and the Machine, Foo Fighters, The Black Keys, Artic Monkeys, deadmau5, anything with Jack White, and Kenny Wayne Shepherd Band. 

I haven't done too much research into options with this budget as I haven't decided if I should be investing in a DAC/Amp combo to replace me receiver. I think the Sennheiser HD600s are at the top of my budget, but that would leave no room for an amplifier. I've heard the AKG Q701s are a very neutral headphone that has an accurate bass presence. Would those be a good pick? Any other options? Help is very welcome!

EDIT: [These worth picking up?](http://www.head-fi.org/t/686477/akg-k701-like-new-great-serial-number) Just saw this ad on Head-Fi that seems to be a great price for the K701s. Would these have the sound I'm looking for? My location being in Germany makes this very appealing to me. I would like to get some thoughts on them still, and if any amplification would be required to get the most out of them. Thanks!","1383264352"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I wouldn't approach a problem like this by making all guns illegal. You start slowly by making gun ownership onerous.

You phase in laws that make people give them up voluntarily.

* Bullets have a huge tax markup.  
* Licensing requires a firearms safety course, background check and psyche evaluation every year paid for by the applicant.    
* Significant mandatory sentencing for any unlicensed firearm in your premises or vehicle.  
* Significant fines if a firearm you own is stolen or lost.  
* etc.

then

* Give licensing discounts to police and security forces.
* Give licensing discounts to farmers who need them for pest control and humanitarian reasons  
* Give licensing discounts to Sports shooters who are registered and keep their firearms in secure lockup at a firing range.

The fact is reducing the number of guns in society reduces the number of guns criminals have and use, significantly reduces successful suicide attempts, reduces tragic family accidents and police are less likely to respond with deadly force.

As for the government problem, having guns hasn't stopped the government doing appalling things to Americans for the last century. We are spied on, have a militarized police force, have a completely unaccountable military and spy agencies, blatant and complete cronyism, had loopholes created so we can have our rights taken away by secret courts etc etc. Having an armed citizenry hasn't helped a first world country fix their government in a hundred years.

I've never had any issues with the game and i don't expect special events because of a meaningless date like halloween (i'm not american), neither do I need to be informed of how many hats they're working on and stuff like that.. just ""surprise me"". All i need are ""changelogs"" when a patch comes out, and for patches to actually come out, and so far they do.

Sure I expected some more hero releases in the near past but after 1000 games there are still heroes in Dota I haven't played, so honestly I can't complain about that. So as far as i'm concerned, Valve does a great job and I wouldn't do it any different, having people cry about stuff they promised taking too long like i've seen in other games (HoN for one) is just stupid.

Well, as long as someone's asking:

The severity of a burn can be described by degrees:

1st degree - limited to the most superficial layers of the skin,
producing redness and pain, as in a scald or moderate sunburn.

2nd degree - penetrates the skin deeper, producing pain and blistering,
as well as some subcutaneous swelling. Blister formation may not be
apparent until several hours after the injury; before the blisters
become visible, the skin may simply be red and mottled. Severe pain is
characteristic of these burns because nerve endings are irritated and
hypersensitive; the slightest pressure or other stimulation of the
burned area causes exquisite pain. Second degree burns are most commonly
caused by contact with boiling liquids. 

3rd degree - involves damage to or destruction of the full thickness of
the skin and can involve underlying muscle, bone (military definition of
'4th degree'), and other structures as well. The skin in a third degree
burn may appear charred and leathery or may be dry and pale. Pain is
usually absent because of destruction of nerve endings. Patients with
third-degree burns are prone to lose massive quantities of fluid; since
they lack the usual protective mechanism of the skin. Massive infections
are not uncommon.

If a person sustains a third-degree burn, there is usually an expanding
ring of burns of lesser severity surrounding it. 

I know, I know ...

ObTasteless:

Received a call for 'woman with burns.' Arrived at an elderly housing
complex, where the fire department was already on-scene, and was
hurrying us up the stairs to the woman's apartment. The smell of burning
plastic and hair wafted through the hallway as we reached her door.
Entered the apartment to find - what else - an elderly woman in some
sort of polyester night-gown, sitting in an easy-chair. Apparently, she
had been in her bedroom, and had fallen asleep while smoking a
cigarette. The cigarette had dropped on her night-gown, which promptly
burst into flame. She awoke to find herself on fire, got out of bed,
walked to her easy-chair, sat down and dialed the fire department. Her
night-gown had melted over her body, leaving large black patches of
plastic molded to her skin, which cracked every time she shifted in the
chair - much to the consternation of the firefighters. Patches of her
hair were singed, the smell of which was overpowering. Initially, the
fire department had thought that she'd fallen asleep in the chair, but
revised their estimate once someone pointed out the black, melted
foot-prints in the carpet leading from the bedroom to the chair, and the
bits of melted flesh that trailed the footprints. By the time we lifted
her out of the chair to place her on the stretcher, the burning plastic 
that had melted onto her back had had time to cool and mold itself to
the chair. The result was that a large portion of the skin on her back
remained with the plastic - on the chair. Her back now looked like oozy,
grey leather - if you could picture that.

In the ambulance, I tried to start an IV, which was hard, since both her
arms had received burns. I applied a tourniquet to her arm, and tried to
clean her forearm with an alcohol swab, only to watch as the entire top
layer of her skin roll off - like a glove, with only gentle rubbing.

This gal was fucked.

A helicopter had been requested to airlift her to Boston. Our unit
arrived at the LZ, and the flight crew jumped in the back of our
ambulance. The flight nurse must have been new, since she took one sniff
and started retching. 

Of course, the woman died.  

:  I may be wrong, but it seems that liquid burns produce a lot more 
: tasteless looking injuries than flames or dry heat/flash fires.  

That's because liquids - especially thick, viscous ones, stick to the
patient, allowing more heat transfer and damage to occur than a simple
'flash' burn. Steam injuries of the same temperature are even worse,
since there is additional heat transfer from the steam going from a gas
phase to a liquid phase - which results in a double-whammy. Not to
mention when the airway is involved, such as a car radiator explosion.
People usually have a sharp intake of breath when surprised - and take
in some superheated steam from the radiator. The swelling of the airway
takes place some time later, and their windpipe closes completely,
necessitating a tracheotomy - messy.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Romans 3:20- *Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin.*

Galatians 3:23-24-  But before faith came, we were kept under guard by the law, kept for the faith which would afterward be revealed. 24 Therefore the law was our tutor to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.*

Galatians 2:16- *yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.* 

James 2:10- *For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.*

The initial justification is not by works of the law, you do not gain salvation by keeping the 10 commandments or good works. No one is good enough (Romans 3:23). Our deeds are as filthy rags before God. Dikaiosis in Greek is the word used for Justification in the NT. It's a legal term meaning that we are declared righteous, acquitted as if in a court of law. Through our faith in Christ we are declared righteous, and Christ's righteousness is imputed to us, and by nothing else. Sanctification, is the process in which God develops the believer until Glorification when we die and we are ultimately face to face with our Lord and are ultimately saved, at that point God will completely mold us into the image of Christ (Romans 8:29; Phil. 3:21).  


&gt;So be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect.

Here you're advocating a sinless perfection doctrine which is heretical. Perfectionism teaches that there is a class of Christians who achieve moral perfection in this life. Read this and you'll understand why: http://www.ligonier.org/blog/heresy-perfectionism/

I realize that a good half of the time is due to the manufacturers having to update their software (which is a whole 'nother gripe fest), but in an ideal world, the U.S. carriers shouldn't be doing jack s*** to the software, just making sure it has the right modem/baseband stuff, APNs, CPU drivers, etc., and passing it along.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","I went last Saturday, site info said to show before 9 or suffer a line up. Didn't listen. Showed up round 10:20 and the lineup was insane. It curled around the 7/11 and was daunting to line up at the end for. Security was not there to keep the cutters from making friends but the line surprisingly moved. After awhile a guy approached us and handed out VIP passes that he swiped while inside. After our friend tested it out, we all skipped the line that we had waited in for 45 mins. 

Inside looked pretty neat at first with a central dance floor and the basics but the bar lineup was a nightmare. After my second visit to grab another beer they were all out and were only offering cheap  bran vodka. I didn't really understand upstairs rooms, some were open and were used as garbage cans for loose cans. Honestly wasn't sure if we were supposed to be up there at the time, no signs or hint that that was ok.

The outdoor thing was kind of silly, the heated lamps were a god send since the dance floor was way too drunk for me. The staff were ok and chatty and everyone seemed to be having a decent time. It wasn't worth some VIP thing, but nothing ever really is. 80 bucks spent expecting a shit night my friend dragged me too but it was Halloween so everyone was in pretty good spirits. My only complaint really was that I couldn't get a steady flow of liquor.

YOU were the only one who listened, because you were one of us, you were an active member of the community. And honestly, you matter to the community. That's something the other mods probably won't understand, bar Travis, since he does post stuff, but people just downvote him because he swears.

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","Well, first of all, bear in mind that PS4 is more powerful, meaning that graphics may be better online. As for the actual online service, it seems to be much improved since PS3, partly because they now charge for online. Cross game chat is now possible, audio quality is better, a microphone is included and dedicated servers are available. This should at least bring PS4 up to scratch with Xbox One and recent rumours suggest that, at least at launch, X1's online is a mess but this is unconfirmed. However, it still means that PS4 is probably the safer bet when it comes to online. PS4 also has some features relating to online that X1 doesn't have, including cross platform play so that, in the future, you will be able to play online games with your friends on other platforms such as Wii U or PC. 
That's about it on the online front so I guess, other that that, it's the other tiny factors that will influence you as X1 and PS4 seem on pretty equal footing when it comes to online. However, I hope I've informed you better of the online situation with PS4. Let me know if you have any further questions. ","1383264374"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","&gt; If I were God, there would be no metabolic processes, so no one would need to eat, drink, or breath.

Also rendering trees and fruit unnecessary.

&gt; There would be no pain, as pain serves no purpose either. Now, there would still be sensation when you do stupid things that will hurt you, but it would be more like a check engine light coming on that you couldn't ignore than pain.
&gt; 

But with NO pain - and by extension no rebuke or difficulty overcoming something, humanity becomes decadent and hedonistic.
Is suffering intrinsically necessary for humanity to be of better character?  (You cant help if no-ones suffering!)

Could this be ""part of Gods plan"" as the believers like to describe it. 


&gt; I would intervene continuously in order to prevent crimes, and even thoughtless behavior.

I killed myself with a grenade and started in the data disc room - both doors were closed. Agent Clinton is really that kind of badass mothfucka which he has shown in the engine room to the sailors. He stucked me too :(

I've noticed, playing BF4, that almost nobody seems to talk at all except to say ""bullshit,"" ""hacks,"" ""lol owned fag,"" etc. It's all I see. It's very rare for people to, you know, shoot the breeze. Say things like ""nice shot!"" or ""Lol, good kill!"" The marginalization of emotion that people do are a response to the typical, stereotypical CoD 14 year old screaming into a microphone. And this does several things:

1. I generally shut off VoIP and chat in games, because it's so rare to find someone who's decent and interesting to talk to, and
2. It gives videogames a reputation for being cesspools of preteen angst and entitlement. And so nobody takes gaming seriously. 

It's so rare to find a game with a decent community. Eve is pretty good because it's so inaccessible, but it'd be nice of we didn't have to constantly be berated by the lowest common denominator anymore.

I'm goddamn sick of it, and I *almost* feel like being okay with attitudes like the one displayed by OP is enabling.

Your team is really good, and after this tough bye week you should be fine going forward, especially if you hold on to Graham, he is elite at his position.

**Reporter:** Clowney you certainly delivered on your boasting today recording three sacks, and a tackle for a loss against Atlanta today. You abused their starting left tackle all day, teams are going to start having to double team you all game. They didn't have an answer for you today. How do you feel about your chances for the Defensive Rookie of the Year?

**Clowney:** Coach Estrella just told me to try and make as big as of an impact as I could and to keep my head down. It's always a good feeling knowing that teams have to game plan for you, so if they commit two to me I still have to find a way to make plays. Defensive Rookie of the Year? More like Rookie of the year, for the last decade the only defensive player to win it has been Suh and I want to break the trend like he did.

**Reporter:** That's ambitious, but you have been hailed as a once in a generation talent, so it's not like the odds are exactly against you. Didn't you run a 4.46 at the combine? That's unheard of for a defensive end.  Good luck. So Mr. Shorts III you were the lone brightspot on the offense recording 8 catches for 111 yards. How do you feel about being number 1 on the depth chart now that Blackmon is going through some issues?

**Shorts:** Well you never want to see your teammate doing bad, all I can do is hope for the best really. It's a blessing to go from a Division three school to being a number one receiver in the NFL, against all odds. You work so hard for this moment, but when it actually comes it's amazing. 

**Reporter;** Everyone loves an underdog.  Coach Estrella despite focusing most of your draft on defense, as a unit they did not play well today. You gave up thirty five points while only scoring seven. You are projected to have the number one pick in this draft, do you disagree?

**Estrella:** Well it's hard for the defense to play well when they're always on the field. I know the offense is trying, but I believe what's holding us back is really the quarterback position. The runningback position hasn't been solved yet, but our QB play will keep us at the bottom of the barrel. It's been one game, you can't call us the number one pick already!

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Oxygen

I remember once I was working on the ambulance, and after clearing from a cardiac arrest call, we were dispatched to a ""routine"" transport of an elderly female with emphysema having trouble breathing. If you've never dealt with elderly people with emphysema, this is just a taste:            
""Hello ma'am, sir [you monstrosity], what's the problem?""
 Possible answers:
 ""Everything.""
 ""I'm sick, why do think I called?""
 ""Where do you want me to start?""
 ""Got a few weeks?""
 ""Don't talk to me, just take me to the hospital.""

""I need to ask you a few question.""
 Possible answers:
 ""You're not a doctor, I don't need to talk to you.""
 ""They have all my records at the hospital - you're wasting time.""

""What medical problems do you have?""
 Possible answers: - see above

""What medications do you take?""
 Posiible answers: - see above, or
 they hand you a shooping bag FULL of medications, and they say ""Don't lode the them.""

Almost all emphysema patients are on home oxygen - and have been specifically warned by their doctors not to exceed a certain limit - say two liters of oxygen per minute via nasal prongs. So they say to you, as you hook up their prongs (which are worn twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week - and develop a crusty, flaky, dead-skin layer on them) ""TWO liters! Only TWO liters! Any more and I'll stop breathing!"" &lt;- promises, promises.

We get this patient onto the stretcher and into the elevator, and are on our way down, when the patient says ""Hey, I'm not getting any oxygen."" Sure enough, that last call emptied out our tank, and now our patient is beginning to panic: ""I can't breathe! My god, I can't breathe!""

My partner, who is behind the patient, and is near the oxygen tank, quickly pulls the tube from it's connector, and unbeknownst to the patient, begins blowing into the tube (approximating what I hope is two liters per minute). ""There,"" I say, winking at my partner, who is now trying not to laugh as she blows, ""we fixed the tank - do you feel better?"" ""Oh yeah, much better."" says the patient. So we're do okay, still going down to the first floor, when my patient suddenly says - ""Hey, how come this oxygen smells like coffee?""

Quick-thinking causes me to say: ""Our company is trying a new product, scented oxygen, in a variety of scents, you have the coffee-scented one. How do you like it?"" ""It's not bad,"" she says [stupid stupid], ""but I would rather have just plain oxygen."" ""We'd be happy to do that, once we get to the ambulance."" So we get to the ambulance, hook her back up to real oxygen (by this time my partner is out of breath), and are on our merry way to the hospital.

A couple of days later, I get called into my supervisors office. Trouble.

""Tae, I got a call from a patient saying she got coffee-scented oxygen.""
 ""Uh, how do you know it was my call?""
 ""When I get calls about coffee-scented oxygen, I _know_ it's got to involve you.""
 ""Okay, it was me, what she call to complain about?""
 ""Nothing, seems that the next time we go to pick her up, she wants coconut- scented oxygen. How am I going to explain this?""
 ""That's why you're the supervisor.""

Only got a verbal warning for that one.","1383264392"

My main suggestion would be to spend as much time as possible working on music.. When you get stuck or bored move on to a new project and you'll be surprised how much a slight improvement or newly learned technique will get you excited to work while also pushing your creativity.

You offered a proposition concerning the shuffling about of financial assets, starting out by saying ""Suppose there are 1000 dollars in existence...""

I framed my response in balance sheet terms only to, in the most literal sense possible, account for everything involved. It's just a list of who has what, keeping track of what is added, what is removed, what is transferred so you know at the end of the process what happened to everything. It's value-neutral, just a way to make sure nothing is overlooked.

What is it about applying that approach to a discussion of dollars that you find so offensive? ","1383264400"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well I don't/can't really know because I can't get in the minds of men, but I can guess, just based on the sources of my own self-esteem fluctuations and my sociology classes!

Appearance: People are hooked on the western standard of beauty. The hair must flow, downwards, and it must be silky smooth (our natural hair texture is tightly curled and tends to defy gravity, so this is not likely to happen naturally), the nose should be narrow but somewhat prominent from a profile view, the eyes should be wide(we've seen Asian women in media who had cosmetic eye surgery for this reason), the butt should be round and big enough to draw attention, but still small and ""cute"" (so no Minaj butts). And some of those aren't ""traditional"" black traits- unless there's been a good deal of mixture. So if people continue to define beauty by this western standard, of course black women are not going to fit people's ideas of the ideal woman. And we are all told that this is pretty, black women included. So some black women don't get over this and will not have self-confidence (and we know confidence is important in attracting people). Some others over-compensate by being overly loud, rude etc. (although, in my experience that does not hold true for very many of us), but this creates that whole negative stereotype that black women are sassy and conceited, etc. We're not all like that. And there are sassy and conceited women and men of all races, we don't have a monopoly on these traits.

Personality: It seems as though there's this belief that black women are loud and rude. We see it in the media, whether created by black or white people. In anything by Tyler Perry, we see this stereotype. And understandably, no one wants to date someone rude. (loud is debatable) But most black women are not like this at all. People just struggle to separate the stereotype from the reality. And chances are, if you see the sassy side of a any woman, there's a reason she's mad, and it's not because of a racial tendency.

Now, this isn't proven or taught, and it's just my own little observation. Potheads: I have no problem with people who smoke marijuana! But (and maybe it's just because of where i'm from) the only guys who like black girls smoke pot. There is nothing I hate more than the high guy who goes up to a black girl and says ""man I just loooooovvvvveeee black bitches"", ""mmm gurl dat ass"", ""ey Shawty"" or something of the like. Guys, drugs are not necessarily part of black culture. Just because i'm black doesn't mean i smoke or know where you can get some of whatever it is you are on. The fact that potheads try so hard to be part of ""black culture"" perpetuates a negative stereotype that black people are innately tied to drugs. What upright person wants to associate with drug culture/black people since apparently they're one and the same?","1383264402"

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;I have a lot of friends that are self proclaimed Anarchists. Ignoring the fact that these guys' lives are completely bought and paid for by ""the state"" (we're military brats), and live quite well because of it, I simply cannot take them seriously.

Simply because they live this way doesn't necessarily mean they endorse or support it. It sounds like you're all fairly young and this greatly limits your options to change your living situation even if you seriously want to.

&gt;The way I see it, if you successfully make an ""Anarchist"" society, people are going to organize themselves eventually and make some sort of ""statist"" society

Why?

&gt;Also, the argument that it's supposed to be a ""true capitalism"" seems ludacris. If you don't have anything to regulate the markets, it just becomes one big monopoly. You replaced the state with a company now. Also, how the hell is a ""capitalism"" going to work in a modern world without fiat money, which only has worth because the establishment that printed it says it does.

I think you're thinking of ancaps, anarcho-capitalists. They're not anarchists in the strictest sense and they're generally not considered to be in the same boat.

&gt;It seems to me that Anarchists are people who want to live in this happy go lucky world that is not only impractical, but is just outright impossible. In the end, they just seem like drugged up arrogant hypocrites that have no idea how things (and people) work.

Your friends may have a lack of experience because of youth but I wouldn't translate that to all anarchists. If you want to get a good idea of what the term means, read some of the literature in the sidebar. The [Anarchist FAQ](http://www.infoshop.org/AnAnarchistFAQ) is probably the best to start with.

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Alexandre stood firmly in the snow, hands tightly gripping his club. This was the final hole, the hardest hole.

They only organize this event once in a decade. Technically, it doesn't even have a real name. Most people just refer to it as ""Golfing around the world"". Every golfer who turned professional heard of it, but they all chose to keep it a secret. Those who didn't were forced to.

You just get selected one day. A single piece of paper in the mailbox, giving you coordinates and a date. You show up with your clubs and at least a few balls, and try to locate the flag. When the ball lands in the cup, a guy in a suit shows up. Marks your score, hands you the next target. You have to arrange travel every time, and you only get notified if you win - and even that happens months after you finished your eighteenth hole. You either get a small trophy and a million dollars in cash, or you don't. You don't even know who you were competing with.

So as Alexandre stood on that lonely peak, he wasn't really sure what he was up againts. The hole was very far away, and it was really, really cold. 'Breathe out - aim - shoot. Perfect.' he mumbled, as he always does. That small little white ball seared through the sky, almost as if it was actually sliding on that trajectory he pictured. He packed up his stuff, and got ready to follow the ball. His feet were going numb, but he knew, if he survived a lion attack, and managed to get a hole-in-one from an active volcano, he can survive this.

He slowly walked away, fighting with the snow, and didn't even notice the dead body just near the starting point. His red coat just slightly sticking out of the snow, only an overturned golfclub marking his grave as an unlikely cross. You see, not all contestants have to be alive at the end so someone can be declared victorious.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Jumping in here for context on the Lucian changes. This is some highly experimental stuff we're trying out very much with the intention of iceboxing it if it works and only bringing it live if we ever feel we need to. I really want to fix satisfaction issues of the rank 1 and 2 of The Culling for you guys--I admit I've been too hardheaded on these for a long time. We know they have a power level that is adequate to the slot and the kit, but the satisfaction is not there. To free up the power budget required for rank 1 and 2 ult buffs we need to take power away from Lucian at those early levels though, and the way we're thinking of doing this is with a bonus AD ratio that scales over the entire game; this way your laser is not super chunk tastic at level 9 without completely falling off by late game (two things that are currently close to being the case on live).

Again, do NOT expect these changes to go live, but any feedback on them is much appreciated.","1383264408"

A slow, humid Friday night - or so I thought.            
Hanging out near a strip of long-closed malls, my partner and I are talking a mile-o-minute - the result of many Coffee Connection mocha frappuchinos, cigarettes, and some Ritalin we confiscated from the previous night's suicide attempt. The silly shit took most of his 'scrip - ignoring the more effective, but less thought-of bottle of Prestone anti-freeze sitting in his garage.

""Why are you doing this to me - 'cause I tried to kill myself?"", the guy wails, as we struggle to cuff him to the stretcher's hand-rails.

""No, we're doing this because you're too stupid to correctly kill yourself, and you got _us_ involved."" I snarl as I finally get the handcuff on him. Ahh... Each ratcheting 'click' is music to my ears as I make the cuff tighter and tighter.

""So, what do take the Ritalin for?"" my partner asks, as he searches for a suitable vein in the patient's forearm to start an IV.

""I have dyslexia and ADD - attention deficit disorder - you know what it means, asshole?"" sniffs the patient.

""Yeah - it means you suck at Scrabble.""

_That_ got us a howl of anger - and a few lame-ass yanks at his cuffed hands.

But I digress...

I was feeling pretty on-edge with all the Ritalin I took. The last cigarette I had tasted real bad, and I dry-heaved a little. Prime.

""Medic 1 - respond with Ambulance 3... Mass Turnpike - westbound, near exit thirteen ... for a roll-over. Called in by the State Police.""

""Medic 1 has it,"" I answer.

Yee-haw ... a call.

As we pull out of the parking lot and onto the highway, I noticed how unusually _sharp_ everything looks. Great stuff, the 'ol vitamin 'R'.

""So, whaddya think - bullshit?""

""Nah, lookit - it's three in the morning on Saturday, it's foggy, and it was called in by the Staties. It's prolly legit.""

We rapidly approach the on-ramp toll booth to the Pike.

The toll-booth guys hate us - 'cause we scream through the gates, honking the air horn impatiently if they take too long to raise the gate-arm, and with all of our emergency lights and strobes, we look like nothing less than a fucking UFO come to bring 'em back Elvis and whisk away their children to conduct experiments - bless their pointy heads.

The toll-collector du jour literally sees us coming from a mile away, and raises the gate-arm well in advance. It should be smooth sailing...

""Hey - watch this,"" my partner yells.

He steers as if to enter the toll-booth with the raised arm, but at the last moment, veers into another one - coming to a complete stop. Siren still wailing, he calmly takes the ticket the dispenser spits out, and waits for the arm to rise completely before proceeding. The toll-collector is livid. We squeal away.

Our laughter is high-pitched - hyena-like, and definitely not normal. Whether it's the Ritalin coursing through our veins or just another indication that we're slowly losing our sanity, it doesn't really matter. We still get paid the same.

The overhead street lamps come farther and fewer apart, until eventually the road ahead is dark - the only illumination coming from our headlights and strobes. The flashes of light are brighter than usual due to the strobes bleeding and diffusing into the fog. I dry heave once more.

Eventually I see the flashing lights of other emergency vehicles in the darkness ahead. We slow down, and come to a stop at the first of a string of road flares laid down to shunt traffic to the right-most lane.

My partner and I get out and move to the rear doors of the truck to get our equipment - only to stopped by a trooper.

""You won't need those,"" he waves at the equipment bags, ""there's nothing you can do for them.""

Taking in the entire scene - which was difficult to do because of the darkness, I see a car which was rear-ended and off to the left side of the highway, just touching the cement jersey-barrier. Standing next to the car are three college-aged kids - huddled together and looking pretty pale. They're all okay.

The next car - about a hundred feet further down the road, is completely unidentifiable to make or model. Little round pebbles of safety glass surround the car - which is sitting on it's roof. Steam rises from the engine as radiator fluid trickles onto the road - a sizable puddle already formed. A little further down from the car, I see a body.

Partially covered with a blanket, I see it's a woman - late twenties would be my guess, her facial bones so shattered that her nose has been pushed-in and is flush with the rest of her face. Lifting a corner of the blanket, and I see that her abdomen was torn open - internal organs splayed out on the road, and a foot-long loop of intestine sits on her chest. My guess was that when she was ejected from the vehicle, she landed in such a way that her body was snapped in half, opening her abdomen, and forcing her legs to bend up to touch her back. The closest thing I can imagine would be one of those Indian fakirs - able to hook both legs around their necks. Gross.

""There's another body about fifty yards further down,"" says the trooper, ""the driver.""

Walking further down, another blanket-covered body. This one - a early-twenties male, is lying on his back. His face is also distorted - a mottled purple and white. His eyes are wide open, with an expression of total surprise. I can see brain-matter coming from his ears, mouth, and nose, with a still-widening, still-steaming pool of dark blood surrounding his head.

""So, just what exactly happened here?"" I ask the trooper.

""Well, as far as I can tell, that first car - the one with the three kids, was traveling pretty slow. The other car must've flew up behind them and rear-ended them. Then it rolled-over a whole buncha times, and the woman was thrown from the car. And then the driver - that guy, crawled out of his car -""

""Wait a minute - the driver didn't die on impact?""

""No, he survived the crash and was standing over his friend, when this _other_ car came flying up the highway, ran over the already dead woman, and hit him. At least that's the story I got from the kids.""

Jeezus.

""So, where's the third car?""

""About another hundred yards from the guy's body. The driver's okay, but pretty shook-up.""

Seeing as how there was nothing for us to do, we started to walk back to our truck. As we walked past the woman's body, I noticed a line of glistening slickness from the woman's body traveling up the highway about ten yards - body fat.

It was definitely one of the most gruesome scenes I'd been to. I needed to have a smoke - something to heighten the already freaky scene. I reached into my pack - empty. Shit.

As I passed by the college kids, still huddled near the jersey-barrier, I asked them if they had any cigarettes. Looking confused, they answered 'no'. Shit.

Just as I was getting into my truck, I heard some yelling. I turned around to see the cops yelling and waving their flashlights at a pickup truck. The driver was a tad confused as to which way the flares were directing him, and was beginning to drive across the flares - heading towards the woman's body.

He stopped in time.

- Tae

ObT: A couple of days later, I read an article in the newspaper about the accident. It seems that a free-lance photographer had driven by the accident, and took pictures of the scene. Of the fifty or so pictures he took, he only sold two to the papers - the others being too graphic in nature to print.

A couple of days after that, I read another article in the paper. It seems that the third car in the accident was really the fourth. True, he did run over both bodies - but only after the _third_ car ran over the woman's body and killed the guy.

Wanna take a guess who was driving the third car?

The guy who took the pictures.

He'd struck both people, kept on driving, turned _around_ and came back down the Pike. He stopped, made no mention that he'd hit the two people, and proceeded to take pictures. What balls - and all for a lousy fifty bucks.

*Hey, do you mind if I tell you a story? One you might not have heard. All the elements in your body were forged many, many millions of years ago in the heart of a far away star that exploded and died. That explosion scattered those elements across the desolations of deep space. After so, so many millions of years these elements came together to form new stars and new planets. And on and on it went. The elements came together and burst apart forming shoes and ships and sealing wax and cabbages and kings. Until, eventually, they came together to make you. You are unique in the universe. There is only one Merry Galel and there will never be another. Getting rid of that existence isn't a sacrifice, it is a waste!*

well, many people here feels entitled because they are constantly supporting the game, you are not just throwing money willy nilly, some people go their way to buy at least some keys here and there and feel like they are supporting the game, so at the very least you would expect many people to feel that way, in my case i dont mind as i said previously, but i remember that in tf2 /long time ago/ they had at least a short paragraph or a couple sentences of snarky remarks on their blog, and people were happy, even if the last update took like a year to come out everyone was glad that someone was on the other side of the screen, this is what people wants more than anything, they dont want promises, they dont want to know the insides of character creation, they just want some aknowledgement.

As for the Vicodin, don't worry about it.  You got to start somewhere.  Vicodin is a nice place to start.  Starting with too high of a mg and you'll just get sick and throw up.

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","The Short answer

1.) For Brawl- (and most likely the others as well) you only need the RSBE01.gct file, and the pf files (fighter, stage, module, menu, menu2, systen, info, info2, game, and sound) inside the brawlminus folder (for the other mods, try the same thing but with their respective folders)

2.) For textures you need to create a folder called textures in brawlmods with a fighter folder inside. So it would look like, brawlmods/textures/fighter/[characterfolder] and you would put it inside there. Stages go inside brawlmods/stages and music goes inside brawlmods/music/strm. 

If any of this doesn't work, refer to the long answer which I'll be editing into this post. 


Edit:

Long Answer:

Disclaimer: This answer is slightly complicated and I'm not even sure everything I'm saying here is correct and/or will work. 

The way riivolution works is by checking the XML document (located inside the riivolution folder, you can open/edit it with textedit/notepad) to see where to look for the different files that mod brawl. Inside the XML file there's a ton of lines of code that all look somewhat like this: 

    &lt;file external=""/brawlmods/projectm/fighter/marth/FitMarth.pac"" disc=""/fighter/marth/FitMarth.pac"" /&gt;

This particular line is the location the moveset file for marth in project M, telling riivolution to look there and use that as marth's moveset. If you removed that line, the rest of Project M would work just fine, but you'd have vBrawl marth's moveset. So, the reason that your texture isn't working is because the XML file doesn't have a line telling riivolution to look at /brawlmods/projectm/fighter/mario/FitMario05.pac for Mario's 05 costume slot. If you wanted to put that file there you would need to add a line to the XML file in the appopriate section that looks like:

    &lt;file external=""/brawlmods/projectm/fighter/mario/FitMario05.pac"" disc=""/fighter/mario/FitMario05.pac"" /&gt;

and then another line for the .pcs file that looks exactly the same exact replacing .pac with .pcs. Otherwise Riivolution looks for FitMario05,pac in the default location it was written to look for which is in brawlmods/textures/fighter/mario and not the project m folder. 

A similar reason is why your other mods aren't working. Riivolution is looking for specifically named files in specific places. You have the right files, but in the wrong places so when it goes to check, it doesn't see it there, and the vBrawl version is used instead. So, you need to put them in the right places which is generally you put the RSBE01.gct and the pf files into the appropriately named file in brawlmods (brawlminus stuff goes in brawlmods/brawlminus). If it continues to not work, you should go into your XML file and make sure that the appropriate lines are there and/or that you put everything you need into the right folder. If the lines aren't there, and you want to fix it yourself, you know have the fun job of trying to figure out the right syntax and writing all the lines combined with lots of testing to see if it works. Or you can search around on smashboards and other places to hopefully find someone or someplace to get an xml file with the correct lines. I've slowly been working on creating an XML file that makes Riivolution work like the hackless version of Project M so that you can use the same folders as them and help for the hackless version will be relevant to riivolution users. (Meaning if a hackless user just puts a file into the info folder, you can do the same thing, just your folder is in brawlmods/[relevant mod]. Im not sure if this is possible however, and I'd stick to using the default locations for Riivolution and not messing with the XML file unless absolutely necessary.

Most of my information comes from [here](http://smashboards.com/threads/riivolution-q-a-and-help-thread.269428/) and messing around with the XML file so, like I said earlier, I could be wrong and none of this might actually work. The link does provide a nice summary of where to put things though, and might give you more information if this wasn't clear enough and/or wrong. ","1383264425"

"technology","t5_2qh16","That's freedom for you, guys. That's the freedom Republicans are fighting for...the freedom for corporations to override the voice of the people.

The freedom for the few to dictate the many -- that's their version of equality. 

Corporations are not people, they're a legal entity so that investors don't lose their homes and cars when the company tanks (or when they tank the company for a buyout).

Corporate citizenship means, without any uncertainty, that we've all lost our citizenship. The minute corporations were legally allowed to fund politicians to whatever amounts they want was the minute you and I and everyone else lost their legitimate voice in our government.

Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, Green Partiers, Tea Partiers, Liberals, Conservatives, Independents, and all other Americans no longer have a voice individually. We no longer have a voice as a group unless that group ends with ""Inc.""

Maybe I'm just cynical about this, maybe time will prove me wrong. I sincerely hope so, I hope that whomever buries me as some crazy person is absolutely right. But if I'm not wrong, if what I believe has been allowed is the correct view, then America is no longer For the People, By the People.

Instead America will be For the Shareholders of XYZ, Inc. by the SuperPACs funded by XYZ, Inc.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The answer is no regardless of how you change this question around.

First, the force through the string isn't instantaneous. As /u/norsoulnet [describes below](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1pn39o/say_i_am_holding_the_end_of_a_string_and_i_have_a/cd3zdhg), force won't propagate faster than the speed of sound through the object.

Additionally, you can't have 10 light years of 'taut' material. In a lot of calculations you can ignore the mass of a string, but not in this case. Even lightweight 60 weight thread would be 1,576,754,730,000 kg. About the mass of a 1.6 km^3 of water. Don't think the string could hold up to having that sort of mass exert force on it.

I don't think the trit vial is supposed to shake around inside like this, it seems real janky.

2) if you are feeling up to visitors in the hospital you can invite them, but again, they can not just barge in. I always waited until I was home, except for my children. I allowed them 1 hour to visit after I was moved into my ""stay"" room. 

3) if you don't put them on the list of people, then they can't come in. Plain and simple, unless you tell your nurse otherwise. 

4) simply tell them that you want a quiet recovery during your hospital stay, if/when you want visitors you will contact them. Otherwise they need to respect your space and wait until you, baby, and daddy are settled in at home. For yours and babies health. If you are breast feeding stress can make it harder, and having someone annoy you (up your blood pressure) is not good at all. 

If they don't want to respect this then tough love to them. It's your body, your baby, and your recovery. They will have plenty of time to see baby after you are feeling better and baby has been checked out and cleared by the pediatrician. ","1383264434"

That's your problem. Ya gotta work on it, man.

Practice flirting with single women who are much older than you are normally interested in. You're clearly not interested in them (because they're ""too old for you""), so you have nothing to lose. Since you have nothing to lose, you can't fail. So step out of your comfort zone on a regular basis. This does two things:

1. You get into the habit of stepping out of your comfort zone, giving you confidence.
2. Your comfort zone expands.

My opinion doesn't appear to be popular, but I feel detachment for a Nazi guard at a concentration camp. That doesn't justify his treatment, and I don't condone violence, but to me he is a personification of the abstract evil of the entire Nazi movement.

Murdoch owns Australia's only subscription TV service (Foxtel) and would have been heavily impacted by a USABLE fibre network in this country.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Poop

By far one of the most disgusting calls I've had the pleasure of responding to happened several years ago.            
My unit was called to an elderly housing project for the 'woman that hadn't been seen in several days.' Upon arrival at the complex, we were met by the police and fire departments. We trudged up the several flights of stairs _all_ elderly housing complexes seem to have, each of us carrying our respective pieces of equipment:

me - airway bag [15 lbs], cardiac monitor [25 lbs]
 my partner - drug box [30 lbs], oxygen tank [20 lbs]
 fire dept - axes [10 lbs] - 'cause they don't look like firemen without axes

An aside: it seems to me that most firefighters suffer what is known as 'Paul Bunyen' syndrome. It's the notion that whatever can't be fixed with an axe, should be destroyed with one. Oh well, what other job entitles you to carry an axe down the streets of a metropolitan city without people jumping behinds desks - and get paid for it?

police dept - paperwork clipboard [2 lbs], donut [3 oz] and cup of coffee [12 fl oz] &lt;- not really fair, since both are gone before the call is over

As you can see, there is a major disparity in the distribution of equipment and their weight.

We were met at the top of the stairs by a 'gaggle' of 'cackling hens' - the woman's neighbors. Seems that with the arrival of the ambulance, they gossip about their neighbors - past and present.

Neighbor 1:[clucks her tongue] ""I bet it's Esther - she hasn't been herself lately.""

Neighbor2: [double-cluck] ""Ever since her hip ...""

Neighbor 3: [cluck thrown in for good measure] ""You know, my hip hasn't been the same either, since the surgery.""

Neighbor 1: [wants to cluck - but already did] ""You remember poor Alice, from a few years ago? Such a nice girl ... Passed away, and no one found her for days.""

A collective shiver runs through the old ladies - was it the fear of death, or delight in being one of the living? They all start to cluck their tongues at the same time, and they quickly make the sign of the cross. Someday I'll come back for each of them. I can't wait.

""Who is it? Do you know who it is?"" an old woman asks eagerly.

""Nope, sorry - won't know until I get inside."" I answer.

They quickly make way so the entertainment can continue.

We reach the apartment door. The police officer knocks on it with his flashlight - ""Hello? Is anyone home?"" No response.

The firefighter steps up with a rings of keys, holding a master key for every elderly housing complex in the city. He finds the right one, and with a little jiggling, the door swings open.

On this hot, humid summer day, I can think of better places to be when the acrid, ammonia-like smell of urine, and musty odor of shit, washes over me. I gag a little. But, hopefully, there is no smell of rotting meat. We enter the apartment. The little eat-in-kitchen has open, half- eaten cans of stew, the sink is full of unwashed dishes, food particles long dried onto them. The refrigerator has a large flourescent sticker on it, which says ""Vial of Life inside."" I open it to see if I can find anything - yup there it is, next to a container of water, a jar of green mayonnaise, and not much else.

My partner calls to me - ""Tae, we found her.""

I go into the bedroom, where everyone had gathered.

She looks to be about seventy or so. But let's face it - after fifty, they all look the same age - old. She's on her side, on the floor, next to her bed, naked. My guess would be that she slipped and fell while trying to get out of bed, and remained there for several days. There is a darker semi-circle on the hardwood floor that surrounds her. This is where the urine dried, and being acidic enough, permanently darkens and stains it. It smells rather strong. But even stronger is the smell of shit. She had several bowel movements during her stay on the floor, which she had either rolled around in, or covered herself in, from head to toe. Her ears were full of shit, her nostrils, her hair was matted- down with it. She was still alive.

My partner went to her head, and began to administer oxygen to her. She first removed the woman's dentures - which were also covered in shit, and was repelled by the fetid, ketonic breath of someone who'd been living off of their stored fat. Joanne began to retch. So did everyone else.

I took a pillow case off one of the pillows to wrap her arm in, so that I could put on the blood pressure cuff without getting it dirty. Her pressure was low, and her pulse was thready. I pinched the skin near her wrist, and it remained 'tented' - a sign of poor turgor, and fluid depletion. We placed her on a long wooden board, strapped her down, and carried her out of the apartment, past her wide-eyed, now genuflecting neighbors, down the stairs, and into the ambulance.

I jumped in back [brave guy, me] and began looking for an IV site. Usually, we use little 2 x 2 in alcohol swabs to clean the IV site, but I didn't think it'd do the trick. So, I got a towel, poured an entire bottle of alcohol onto it, and proceeded to clean her entire left arm. The towel turned brown from all the dried shit I cleaned off of her. Eventually I got to clean skin. I stuck a _huge_ needle into this woman's arm, and began to pour fluid into to her - to combat her low blood pressure and dehydration.

While enroute to the hospital - her blood pressure began to climb, so did her level of consciousness. She came to, her eyes opened, and she turned her head ever so slightly left and right. She settled her eyes on me.

""Are you my son?"" she asked.

Now, old women always seem to ask this question - not just to me, of course, but to every male their corneal-occluded eyes and age-addled brains encounter. Normally, I would tell them no - and they would gnash their teeth and wail - and ask for their son, usually some long dead oldster himself. But for some reason, my little black heart let out a little sympathy for this woman - this urine and shit-covered woman, who would most likely die in the next few days. So I figured that I'd play along, and answered ""yes.""

""Funny ... I don't remember sleeping with any Chinese men.""

I laughed long and hard all the way to the hospital.

&gt;Both had a form of blitzkrieg.

"bjj","t5_2qn02","Reading this thread as an attorney is disappointing because most folks don't understand even the most basic aspects of the legal system.  I'll try to provide at least *some* explanation of how the jury could have acquitted even in light of the evidence you believe is overwhelming.

The jury isn't just answering the questions ""did he rape her?"", they have to essentially check a handful of boxes that are the ""elements"" of a crime.  I'll use my state's sexual assault statute because I at least have some familiarity with it.  To be convicted of sexual assault, each and every member of the jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that: (1) the defendant; (2) in the State of Maryland, on or about the date alleged; (3) knowingly; (4) inflicted sexual intrusion or penetration on another; (5) when he/she knew that  the victim was incapable of appraising the nature of the victim's conduct.  A jury has to be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt on all of the numbered ""elements"" to convict someone (or at least this is what the judge will instruct them and they will be required to swear an oath to follow).

Before I begin, please keep in mind I am not talking about this specific case.  I only know the tiny, tiny bit that was included in the story. 

Let's look at possible ways to defend here. Elements 1 and 2 are essentially going to be admitted.  There are only defenses regarding identity or the location in rare circumstances.  Element 3: knowingly.  Perhaps the accused person had been drinking or on drugs him or herself.  In some states that can be a defense to having a knowing mental state.  Perhaps the accused person was having a seizure or in a fugue state.  

Element 4: inflicted sexual intrusion/penetration.  I don't know the facts of this case, but a possible defense under this element is arguing that the accused person didn't actually penetrate the victim.  You could argue that the victim was intoxicated and can't remember what happened, ""but Mr. Client hadn't drank a bit that evening and he testified today that there was no sex!""  Perhaps there isn't any DNA evidence in the case.  If that was the case, you could so far as to say ""See! There isn't any DNA, so that backs up Mr. Client's story about no sex taking place!""

Element 5: when he knew victim was incapable of apprising the nature of his conduct.  Here, there are a lot of defenses.  Perhaps the victim was acting totally normal.  ""How is a person supposed to know when their date crosses the line when he/she acts exactly the same all night?""  Perhaps the accused was intoxicated him/herself.  When you drink, you tend to miss a lot of details.  Perhaps you don't notice the fact that the victim is slurring his/her words because the accused person was drunk, too.

Again, I'm not talking about this case in particular, but I am just trying to point out how a jury finding someone ""not guilty"" doesn't mean that the person ""didn't do it"" or didn't do anything wrong.  They could have found that elements 1-4 were met, but that they weren't convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused was aware that his/her victim was too intoxicated to consent.

I hope that provides some idea of the many ways in which a jury can acquit someone and not feel good about it.","1383264449"

Capitalism is about money, not making people happy. Sometimes satisfying customers is the way to make money, not all the time.

Sun Tze Ch 13. **[The Use of Spies](http://suntzusaid.com/book/13)**

&gt;Hostile armies may face each other for years, striving for the victory which is decided in a single day. This being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condition simply because one grudges the outlay of a hundred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments, is the height of inhumanity. 

&gt;One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present help to his sovereign, no master of victory. 

&gt;Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good general to strike and conquer, and achieve things beyond the reach of ordinary men, is FOREKNOWLEDGE. 

&gt;Now this foreknowledge cannot be elicited from spirits; it cannot be obtained inductively from experience, nor by any deductive calculation.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Britain started metrification in the 70's too. Almost everyone who went to school was taught exclusively in metric. That means most people under 50, maybe under 60 are native metric users. However in the same time we've had to grow up in a country where people are resistant to that change. The older generation still use the old system and it's something that even we, the ""youngsters"" still use.

Do you and your friends talk about how tall people are in cm or feet and inches? I think I'm the only person I know who knows their height in cm, at least the only person born here. Do you talk about how much a person weighs in Kg or stone?

My point is most people, even those who know metric very well, use imperial for most things simply because everyone else does. Apart from the temperature I can't think of anything that you might use in conversation that is likely to be metric, other than when your shopping or cooking.

It will take an act of parliament to change anything. Maybe you don't remember but we had a massive outcry when the government finally decided to make shops sell in metric units. This is in a country that's been doing so voluntarily for the most part for quite some time. Of course, all that's really left to do is change motoring so that speed and distance are both metric. It'll be much bigger deal to most people than the last change because everyone is so used to the old system.

Even then, they can't force people not to use metric in daily life. People will still talk about stones and feet rather than kg and metres. They can't stop papers telling us the thermometer hit 100 degrees in Brighton on the bank holiday, even if it's not a sign of the apocalypse.","1383264455"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;Capitalist Secrets: There Are No Monopolies on a Free Market

http://capitalism.aynrand.org/capitalist-secrets-there-are-no-monopolies-on-a-free-market/

We often hear that we need government to intervene to prevent monopolies. But the truth is that on a free market there are no monopolies: monopolies are created by government intervention.

A bit of history is helpful. Originally the term “monopoly” referred to a special government privilege that protected a company from competition, whether through a franchise, a subsidy, or some other legal restriction on entering a field. The old East India Company, for example, had true monopoly power: the British empire would not allow any other British company to trade in the East Indies. (A modern example would be the U.S. Postal Service. If you try to compete in the delivery of first class mail, the government will put a stop to it.)

But during the 19th century, the critics of capitalism switched the meaning of “monopoly” from a company that was protected from competition by government to a company that achieved a dominant position in a given market.

This was a totally illegitimate switch. A coercive, government-backed monopoly is protected from competition; a company that has achieved a dominant position on a free market is not. A coercive, government-backed monopoly can subject its customers to poor service and high prices, since the customers have nowhere else to go. But if a company that has achieved a dominant position on a free market then slacks off, the door is open to any competitor who can do better.

There is only one way to achieve and maintain market dominance under capitalism: to provide the best overall value to customers—to offer better products, lower prices, unmatched service, unbeatable efficiency. Contrary to what we’ve been taught, this is how firms like Standard Oil and Microsoft achieved huge market shares.

On a free market, monopolies cannot exist. No matter how successful a company is, it is never immune from competition. It always faces at least potential competition, as well as actual competition from companies that offer substitutes.

Alcoa, for instance, dominated the market for aluminum for a time, yet this did not result in higher prices for customers, but lower prices. Why? Because, even in the absence of strong competitors, raising prices would have attracted such competitors, while Alcoa’s customers—say, Coca-Cola—could have applied further pressure by switching back to glass bottles instead of the more expensive aluminum cans.

The free market protects freedom of competition—any company can use its property to offer products and services to consumers on any voluntarily agreed upon terms. The result is not destructive monopolies, but an explosion of productivity, creativity, and innovation.","1383264457"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Squinting your eyes creates a smaller opening (called an [aperture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperture)) through which light travels.  By making this opening smaller, you are creating an effect similar to that of a [pinhole camera](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinhole_camera).  Pinhole cameras work by forcing light to travel through an opening that is close to a single point.  If all light rays are forced to travel through a single point, they are forced to be perfectly focused (ignoring [diffraction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction), which won't come up in squinting your eyes).

One way to test this yourself is to squeeze your hand together in a [way sort of like this](http://imgur.com/XGjQH5m) that makes a pin-sized opening.  You should find that even without squinting you can see pretty clearly like this.

Incidentally, this is why one of the [suggested ways to view a solar eclipse](http://www.skyandtelescope.com/observing/objects/eclipses/3306081.html) is to view it using a pinhole to focus an image of the eclipse.","1383264458"

"CarAV","t5_2t73y","OK, Sock there is always a possibility of ""overpowering"" the woofers, however with a little discipline and common sense the setup will deliver lots of bass punch for years.  Now what am I talking about using common sense?  For starters don't have the amps gains pegged to max, don't have the crossover set at anymore than 120hz, and if your head unit has a loudness setting and your jamming loud turn the loudness off.  That alone cooks more subs than an amp overpowering the subs.  And most of all LISTEN, LISTEN to the sound coming from the subs and back that shit down when you start to hear distortion.  Distortion is like porn, in that it's hard to define but you'll know it when you hear it or see it.  You'll also know your overdriving the subs if you catch a wiff of burning plastic.  That's your woofer's voice coils telling you to back off because they can't dissipate the heat from you beating the living shit out of them.  

Now you see Sock the power ratings from any amp are contingent upon a number of factors like available current and that's where the wiring becomes important.  Think about this like you would a hose.  The bigger the hose the more water can be had right?  Of course, and it's no different in the power wire from the amp.  Using a 6 gauge wire is like me asking you to drink a milkshake from a cocktail straw my man!  You might get a swig or two but your ass is going to pass out trying to suck up that shake thru that tiny ass straw huh?  Damn right.   So do yourself a favor and get as big a wire as you can afford and not that cheap ass bullshit amp kits that have the fake 4 gauge aluminum clad stranded wire with more insulating plastic around it than wire.  It's a ripoff and can light your shit up Sock because it's total shit.  Look for OFC (Oxygen Free Copper) and be damn sure you get a solid ground.  Make sure that wherever you ground the ground wire it's to an UNPAINTED METAL SURFACE.  Scrape it down to the bare metal if it's grounded to the vehicles body panel, and no longer than 8"" and tight.  Doing this will give the amp and woofers a fighting chance to live many years and rock your Sock off...     ","1383264463"

From: st871622@pip.cc.brandeis.edu (you're reading what?)
Subject: puking at Ground Round
Date: Sun, 1 May 1994 18:18:50 GMT

My unit received a call to respond to a local 'Ground Round' restaraunt.
Now if you aren't familiar with 'Ground Round,' they're just a chain
of restaraunts that push 'safe, family dining.' Usually you can find a
clown or magician making the rounds in these restaraunts - entertaining
the kiddies. They also have a habit of serving freshly-popped popcorn as
a munchie while you wait for your order.

The call came in as '55 year-old female, complaining of chest pain.' When
we arrived, we were met at the door by the fire department, the restaraunt
manager, and 'Bobo' - the multi-colored clown. We were led to a table in
the rear of the restaraunt, where two elderly couples were dining. An
elderly woman in ther mid-fifties (dispatch was right for once) looking
pale, a little diaphoretic, complaining of 'heavy' chest pressure, and
slight difficulty breathing. She already took her nitroglycerin - five of
them, over a ten-minute period. ""Five?"" I said, getting out the bp cuff.
""Well, they didn't seem to be working,"" was her reply. Usually, people are
instructed to take _three_ of their nitros - maximum, and over fifteen
minutes. My guess is that her blood pressure was pretty low after taking
five of them in only ten minutes.

An aside:

When strange things happen in public places, isn't it strange that people
ignore the situation, and carry on as if nothing is happening? The other
diners at the restaraunt, pointedly ignored us and the woman - although 
some sneaked side-long peeks. Some of the children just stared at us - until
they were told by their parents not to...

I had just placed the cuff on her arm, when she said that she felt like
vomiting. After making sure I wasn't in the line of fire, I quickly looked
around...and saw nothing handy to grab. That is, until, a waitress rounded
the corner carrying a tray loaded with baskets of freshly-popped popcorn.
In one fluid motion, I grabbed one of the trays, dumped the popcorn on the
ground, and slid the basket under the woman's chin just in time to catch her
first heave. I then handed the basket to Bobo, who didn't look very happy 
to be receiving a partially digested 'surf 'n turf.' 

We then negotiated the woman onto the stretcher, and started to wheel her 
out, navigating through the sea of tables and diners. We were just passing 
by a table with a family, when the patient puked again - this time on her
lap. The children at the table looked at this woman in fascination, while
the parents eyed each other - then their plates, and called for the check.

As we passed through the front doors of the restaraunt, I noticed Bobo
standing outside, having another cigarette. As I passed by him, I said,
""Hey Bobo, can you do a trick for me?"" ""Fuck off,"" he hissed under his
breath. Ah, everybody loves clowns.

With uranium, thermal reactors only burn about one percent of it. You get the U235, plus some U238 that turned into plutonium. Fast reactors do much better, and ultimately burn up all the U238.

Thorium reactors can fully burn the fuel using thermal neutrons. With either fast uranium reactors or thermal thorium reactors, all the energy you need for your entire life can come from a chunk of fuel smaller than a golfball. Either fuel could run civilization for thousands of years. In the very long term, we could extract uranium (but not thorium) from seawater, and then it'd last millions of years. 

The main reason we went with uranium instead of thorium is that the Navy had already developed uranium reactors for submarines, and we went with what we knew.","1383264477"

Examples of your controlling behavior:

&gt;Eventually I got fed up with it, and told her I was going to tell her Mom and I walked away.

and

&gt; I threatened to tell her older sister (also adopted, and constantly bullies her).

Followed by some childish tough-guy behavior:

&gt;I drank a bunch of NyQuil (a whole bottle) and decided to try to sleep.

Followed by threatening her family:

&gt;""I can no longer guarantee the safety of you or your family, my family cannot afford loose ends""

Followed by more childish tough-guy behavior:

&gt;Drove about 60 miles to a friends house, intoxicated, speeding on a canyon road

Followed by some textbook narcissism:

&gt;When she saw me right there, I could look straight through everything in her. Her eyes told the story. Fear, heartbroken, destroyed. I simply said ""I'm sorry"" and left.

and

&gt;I don't know why I'm even sharing this story, but it's important to let people read your mistakes.

Guys, **GUYS**, see how **bad** I feel about everything?  Poor poor pitiful me!

Also this:

&gt;I watched her grow up. I treated her like a daughter for all these years.

Is incredibly creepy and makes you sound like a pedophile.  Hopefully she's getting help from her family to heal from this abusive relationship.

edit: Also you can't actually get high of NyQuil.  You're thinking of Robitussin.  Even if you could, it wouldn't justify your awful behavior, but when you try and hide behind that you sound like a middle schooler trying to look tough by snorting a pixie stick.","1383264480"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","The first one was pretty hard because I was only 17 and wasn't ready for that responsibility. To look after someone else and to try to revive them from overdoses. That's where my past ""drug use"" was, I tried basically everything I've ever tried with him. I guess I just don't have an addictive personality. Either it would be ""That was fun, but I probably shouldn't do it again"" or it'd be something I was too afraid to try (meth/heroin). I finally broke things off when I realized that I couldn't be around that or take care of him anymore. 

The second one was my most recent ex. I was madly in love and kept making excuses for him because he told me he'd quit. He kind of deceived me in the beginning telling me he wanted to stop doing drugs, smoking cigarettes and drinking all on his own. After about six months I finally brought up that he hasn't even cut back and then came the tears and empty promises, so I thought if we loved each other, we'd get through it. He finally dumped me six months later saying that things would never work out after major progress from him. I saw him once after and he was completely drunk and high, and I'm completely okay with it now. I never tried to change him, but he tried to be someone he wasn't.  I was so heartbroken at the time, but realize that I'm better off. 

I think some people can do it socially and are able to stop on a whim, but others use it as a coping mechanism in order to mask or run from problems. I know I'm probably super biased because of my experiences, but I just can't be with someone who feels like they need to use drugs or alcohol in order to feel normal or to enjoy themselves.","1383264482"

The City of Toronto has some of the lowest property taxes in the region, and recent events have shown there is political ""leadership"" willing to raise taxes for transit, albeit in the wrong places.

What are your thoughts on dollar cost averaging?  Say I've got 50k to put in, does it make sense to buy in, say 10k at a time over 5 weeks?  My thoughts would be that it makes sense to lower the risk you buy in at a high point.","1383264485"

"Bad_Cop_No_Donut","t5_2qqdb","&gt; In what way is this functionally different from a town-hall-style meeting? 

not sure - I have never been to a town hall meeting, but I have been to hundreds of lectures.  I didn't understand why you brought any of that in - that's why I tried to kind of summarize what this was.

&gt;Excellent arguments. I suppose with rhetorical acumen like that you would have intellectually manhandled a professional politician like Kelly as well as set that crowd straight. 

if you say 2+2=5, it's not my job to teach you why you are wrong...I am just pointing out that it's a wrong answer.  I could go into details (in fact I did when I brought in the Ahmadinejad lecture - IF what you were saying was correct (it isn't) he would have been the person in power (he wasn't).

don't make me do all the heavy lifting here buddy...

&gt; I wouldn't be surprised if a pro-regime Iranian saw the video from Columbia, if they wouldn't think those young students came across as rude and Ahmadinejad reasonable and statesmanlike.

I would.  Plus you are forgetting something - it's not the hardliners in Iran that need convincing.  The function wasn't to fix Iran - it was to show to the rest of the world that he is a lunatic.  The debate is for rational people who use reason to form opinions - not hardliners set in their ways.

&gt;My point is that if a well-informed woman were put on stage with him instead of sniping from the crowd, then he wouldn't start out in the position of power.

he didn't start in a position of power - that's just your wrong assumption/opinion.

someone presenting an idea is in no position of power - it's exactly the opposite! He is exposing himself to one way criticism.  It's his ideas out there...it's his ideas being attacked and challenged.

&gt;That imbalance is intentional on his part precisely because it is advantageous.

so now you are saying that it was the University's intention to put Kelly in power?  Since they are the one who hosted this - Brown University is pro PD/Kelly?  That's your argument?

&gt;I have a feeling that if he hadn't been boo'd off stage, this wouldn't be a story at all. 

right - but we don't rely on ""feelings""  There is no reason to assume that there would have been no story...it depends on what the questions were and what he was challenged on.

I had a right sided procedure done so I could shake people's hands and not give them a water bath. My thoracic doc said I had the worst case he had ever seen. I could soak through 5 layers of paper in under a minute. I was Aquaman.
Ever since the surgery I have not had a single drop of sweat form on the right side of my body, from the waist up. There is a definite line on my face where sweat forms and ceases. It runs down the exact middle of my face, chest, and stomach.
During the procedure they deflate a lung, make 3 incisions befween the ribs, and cauterize the nerves, which run along the inside of your ribs. This makes sweating extinct. 
So my answer would be that I used to sweat waaay too much, and now I dont sweat at all! (On the right side of my torso)","1383264488"

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","He knows exactly what it means; he's being blackmailed by the NSA to say those things. 

If the entirety of the US government except for a handful of people at the tippy-top of each branch didn't know the scope of the NSA programs, &amp; even those [only got piecemeal and misleading information drenched in alphabet soup](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20130814/11070124175/white-house-knew-that-mike-rogers-withheld-details-nsa-surveillance-others-congress.shtml) *on purpose*, and, like most Americans, assumed that the tapping *et.al.* was only being used against foreigners/terrorists, then they would have been using computers &amp; phones like they normally would for the last 30 years, including the [more-than-a-decade that the NSA has been bulk-collecting &amp; storing all this data on millions of Americans to be perused @ any time by its own internal higher-ups](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/politics/21intel.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0). Think that's ludicrous? [NSA whistleblower Russ Tice claims he held a wiretap order for Barack Obama in his hand back in 2004](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/20/russ-tice-nsa-obama_n_3473538.html); that alone should scare the shit out of you.

After all, how much embarrassing/illegal stuff do you think lawmakers do which would force them to resign if it came out? Lots, I'd wager. Given that the NSA now has more raw information on the American people than the Gestapo had about their own populations (screw Godwin's law), I think the following scenario is more plausible than implausible to explain why Congress, the Courts, and the Executive have seemed to be dragging their heels on reigning in this surveillance:

&gt;**NSA: Say the talking points we want you to say or we [tell your wife you had an affair with a staffer / plant child porn on your work computer via the backdoors we have built into all AMD and Intel processors / kill you &amp; falsify evidence, then seal the casefile for 80 years in the name of ""National Security""]; step out of line, and you can say goodbye to your political career. Keep your head down, make sure we can still ""stop terrorists"", and you'll get to enjoy that nice government pension in a couple of years.**

"Portland","t5_2qi2i","First of all, now you are talking about *trademark* law, which is a different mater entirely from Copyright, and would merely constitute *additional* liability for OP, not a good defense. Secondly, marks can be distinguished by the goods and services they are meant to be source identifying material for, allowing multiple companies to have a similar mark for different products, so it is perfectly possible that both the city of Portland *and* Walmart have claims to a similar mark for different goods. In this case, Walmart's mark [appears to apply handbags](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75429101&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch) and [sleeping bags](http://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=75026621&amp;caseType=SERIAL_NO&amp;searchType=statusSearch), and other outdoor equipment and sportswear, not for sweatshirts or hoodies (though I allow for that possibility, as my search at the USPTO was not exhaustive, and I acknowledge Walmart could make many arguments that these products would be likely to be sold side by side, causing confusion). But this analysis is largely irrelevant for a copyright claim anyway. Third, the link in the comment you responded to quite clearly illustrated that you can license the work through the BIBS on behalf of the city of Portland.

Finally, I spoke to you in that tone because you did something very unethical: you provided legal advice *as if it were certain* when you would seem to have little idea what you are talking about (if you actually do have legal background, then honestly I am even more surprised by your approach). *At best* the legal grounds for the claim is very questionable. At worst, you are outright wrong and this constitutes clear infringement. What you did was unethical because, were someone to take your advice, they could land themselves in considerable legal trouble. It could cost them their business, and potentially even their personal assets. This is why one should always consult with an attorney. One would hope OP would know that, but your behavior is still irresponsible regardless.

Now, it is not the case that OP would have no defenses. They would. For example they could argue various derivative work defenses, possibly a fair use claim, maybe that there is not substantial similarity between the works, and they could make several distinctions concerning the work itself to suggest no infringement even occurred. What OP should *not* do is simply assume they are in the clear because some rando on the internet told them with complete confidence that there was no chance of there being legal liability.

Check that link out. If you know how, you can build a PC for way cheaper than buying an expensive Razer or other 'gaming' computers and it will run very nicely.. But if money is not a problem for you, then you can go for one of those expensive gaming desktops or laptops. Whatever you do, DO NOT buy any laptop or desktop that's really cheap. I am unfortunate enough to have bought a Dell Inspiron laptop for about 300$ before I started playing League so I am stuck with this until I can afford a new one. It is the absolute worst computer for playing League. I am lucky to get 30 FPS on Summoner's Rift, and Howling Abyss is almost unplayable for me. As for a good ISP, every ISP will be about the same. AT&amp;T is what I have and they are awful. I have heard the same for Comcast so that's all up to you depending on your area.

From: st871622@pip.cc.brandeis.edu (you're reading what?)
Subject: Squirrels in my freezer
Date: Wed, 6 Apr 1994 08:32:39 GMT

When I was living in the Alsston/Brighton area of Boston, I had the first
floor of a lovely house in a quiet residential area. An attorney had bought
the house as an investment, and had re-done *everything* in the house. So,
it was quite beautiful, when we first moved in.

My housemates and I would greet the morning with cups of coffee, and high-
powered air rifles, sitting on the back porch which overlooked a small,
forresty-like clearing surrounded by apartment buildings. Our prey?
Squirrels - or as one of my housemates quipped:""They're just tree-rats..""
My sentiments indeed.

We lay in wait for the furry creatures, talking about sports, beer, who got
to park in the off-street parking lot that week (hotly debated topic), beer,
until a squirrel would enter our ""kill-zone"". Then, soft lead pellets would
fly, hopefully to fell one of ferocious tree-rat (you should see them when
cornered), but most often only to shatter an apartment window, or two.

When one of the most wily of urban-jungle creatures was shot, we would leave
the porch to gather the sometimes still moving animal (which was dispatched
with all the speed due to this noble creature), and beleiving that you eat  
what you kill, would skin and dress them. I tried squirrel once - very gamy,
not to mention quite chewy, and we all quickly agreed our future catches 
would go to feeding our house cat - seeing as how we could no longer afford
the manufactured cat-food sold by the running dogs of imperialism.

But even the cat had some semblance of good taste, as it bravely quafed down
each morsel that was offered to it - since it had no other food to eat. It
also quickly puked up every morsel it quaffed down - which brought upon it
the discipline it so richly deserved. Eventually, a large stockpile of
squirrel carcasses (neatly wrapped in plastic and tin-foil) grew in our
freezer. And eventually, as good things must, we all parted ways. Some to
further their education, others to fulfill the requirements of their parole
officers. As the last occupant of the house, it was up to me to clean it up,
and to leave it *just* the way we had found it when we first rented those
many years ago... Sure.

After throwing as many clothes I could into garbage bags, I screwed out of
there. Leaving behind *many* holes in the walls, piles of garbage, and
half a dozen frozen (and dressed) squirrel carcasses in the freezer, suitable
for a party of six, or one cat for a week. I also neglected to inform the
power company of our departure, necesitating the shutting-off of our power.
The landlord, who lived in the burbs, never came by to check on us (sucker)
and rented the house to two women attending a nearby college. They were to
move in two months after we departed.

I called several months after I moved out to see if I could get some of my
security deposit back (folly). Once the landlord realised who was on the
other end of the phone, he started screaming hysterically. Snippets: ""the     
piles of garbage"", ""hardwood floor"", ""holes in the walls"", ""modeling clay
on the ceilings"", ""broken water pipes"", ""rotting something in the freezer.."",
""girls wouldn't move in"",""had to replace refrigerator"",""thousands of dollars
of repairs"" I got the impression I was not going to get my deposit back, but
that's what deposits are for. After telling him i moved to another state, I
hung up. Thinking about this, I realized that the power company had shut-off
the power, the carcasses had defrosted, and sat there, in a dark, airless
compartment for over two months. I _almost_ cringe thinking what it was like
for those two girls to open the freezer after sooo long. Almost.

There's a dead squirrel beside the path to my house-- it dropped down out of 
the blue one day and is now reposing (and decomposing) happily atop a pile of
last year's rotten leaves. As I go by on my way to class every morning, I like
to stop and examine its progress towards oblivion. at first it looked pretty 
much like a normal treerat, but as the days went by I noticed that its eyes had
disappeared, leaving gaping, oozing dark red sockets. Now its mouth and under-
belly are starting to cave in, leaving interesting contours in the scabrous
skin revealed by its rapidly disappearing fur. Anyone hungry?

ObTasteless: My yeast infection continues to grow apace, although now I have
lovely medicine for it. More varieties of funny-smelling cream than you can
shake a tampon at, and, even more fun, vegetable-oil based suppositories that I
have to put in with this little plunger-thing (one of those doodads that looks
so carefully innocuous that you know it has to have some sort of tasteless use.
Maybe I should auction it off. Anyone want?). Anyhow, the upshot of all this is
that every morning, I wake up well nigh adrift in a sea of rancid vegetable 
oil, curdled cream, and yeast chunks. Makes for a nice wake-me-up, though!

I'm going to come back in a week and see if the network issues are sorted out. There is just no reason for me to play the game right now, because it's only an exercise in frustration that leaves me with a sense of disgust. 

There are a whole lot of things that are disgusting about BF4, actually. 

Drones =  Good luck ever trying to be sneaky or flank or do anything when the enemy team has a commander active. Also good luck ever removing the drone, it's back 10 seconds later should you actually somehow kill it. Also please enjoy having a bright fucking KILL ME NOW symbol placed on your head if you are doing well enough to become a high-value-target. Fucking stupid.

MRLS = park and spam aoe. Click on the always-spotted-because-drones hordes of infantry, and get free kills. As if mortars weren't broken enough.

Attack fighters = unkillable UFO's in the hands of anyone with pitch-up bound to a key, also enjoy never being able to fly one yourself, because the airwhore will be in it the entire game

Scout Copters = helo whore's newest and most broken toy, attack chopper on steroids with infinite health via repairbitch. Most absurd kill farming tool in the game right now, easily.

Maps = Conquest or go home, the Rush maps are mostly incredibly unbalanced to favor the defender, and none of them can actually support the 64 player mode. 

Come to think of it, I actually really dislike the game. Maybe I'll just uninstall it and get a chargeback. It shouldn't be hard, considering it doesn't fucking work and EA has failed to provide the service they said they would.

"TTC30","t5_2yhgk","Hello! I'm 36, hubby is 38. We have been married 6 years, known each other for 17. We have been trying for a little over 2 years now with one MC in Sept at 10 weeks. We did all the usual tests and everything came up fine except a little endo which they cleaned out. For us money is a big deal so most infertility treatments are out, particularly as I just dropped $4000 on a D&amp;C. I have another appointment in Dec where the doctor said we can try looking into some more options but I'm not feeling to optimistic right now...

For me this whole TTC thing has been incredibly hard. I wanted to wait until I was 100% sure before we started trying. Now I'm sure and it just isn't happening. I've watched so many kids come into our family and friends lives and always believed our time would come. I'm everyone's favorite aunt and an all around kid magnet. I had hoped to start our family earlier but my husband had some major health issues right after our marriage which put things on hold for awhile. Once we got started the first half dozen months of failure I kept my chin up. Now... between the MC and everything else we have been through I think I've fallen into a pretty bad depression. There are days the TTC sites are all that keep me going and days where my husband demands I stay off the computer for a few days because I'm driving myself crazy. To be honest I'm not always sure these forums are good for me. It is like poking an infected wound just to feel the pain. 

But yeah, that is my ttc story in a nut shell. Thanks for letting me vent.    ","1383264501"

"Washington","t5_2qjvz","You should check out [Vancouver or one of its suburbs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Vancouver)!  I just moved here a few months ago, and I really enjoy it.  

It's on the boarder with Portland, Oregon, they feel a lot like two parts of the same city.  Portland feels like the industrialized, active downtown, while Vancouver feels like a comfortable suburb (even though it's the 4th largest city in the state).  Portland also gets tons and tons of cool events cycling through their [convention centers](https://onlineservices.oregonmetro.gov/iebms/coe/coe_p1_all.aspx?oc=10&amp;cc=OCCCOENEW), you basically get all the perks of living in a major city and cultural center without actually having to deal with living in the middle of all the hustle and bustle.

It is also only 2 hours from Olympia, 3.5 hours from Seattle, and 3 hours from ocean shores, and you can Completely bypass going over the pass to the east side by driving through Oregon for about an hour, avoiding any high traffic centers without particularly effecting the length of trip.  

The [climate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver,_Washington#Geography_and_climate) is also a bit different than the Puget Sound, being kind of a half way point between them and Eastern Washington.  Decent rain and decent sun, but occasional ice storms in the winter.  Luckily, the public transit for both Vancouver and Portland is pretty good, so I'm hopeful to not need to drive in it too much.

Oh, and if you live in Washington and shop in Oregon, you don't pay income or sales tax.  It's a fun local hack. ","1383264503"

"Chameleons","t5_2sg2w","that is absolutely a good idea to buy online. You buy directly from the breeder so most of the time you get to see their lineage (who the father is). It depends on if lineage is important to you. A purebred is more expensive, but you get to know that it is worth your money, and you have a pretty good idea of what the adult will look like. I went to the reptile expo and only one table was selling baby panthers. They couldn't tell me the lineage or even the gender of the babies. There was one that had color so I knew it was a male, and the price was what I was looking for, but I have no idea what he will end up looking like as an adult. I have no idea how old he is (I estimate about 3 months now) I am really lucky so far because as he is growing his colors are looking exactly like I was hoping for. Here is a pic of him: http://i.imgur.com/HcnQDJQ.jpg The only thing they could tell me was that he was an ambilobe-ambanja mix.

So price should not be the issue (unfortunately for me, it was the main issue), but rather quality, warranties, shipping, and the extra things that the provider does should be more important. 

The only website that I have been following closely for the last year, and I like is http://www.chameleonsonly.com/ I like looking through their breeder galleries.

I also know that some people on here have bought from http://screameleons.com/

It is also much safer to buy online also because it is less stress on the chameleon. If you think about it. It goes from a breeder, to a pet store (can be there for weeks to months) then is bought. If you buy it from an expo then it went from the breeder, and then is hauled around from expo to expo. That is a lot of stress. If you buy online it is right from the breeder to your house. So it is much less stress. 

you could make a new post and ask what breeders other people have bought from.

Well, that is all I have to say about that. let me know if you have any other questions.","1383264503"

&gt;Correct except the 'illusion' part. Life is a complex chemical reaction.

I'm saying that life, as most people think of it, is an illusion. Not many people think of life as some literal chemical reaction. Many people even believe in souls and things like that. They believe that there is more to consciousness and life than chemicals and electrons, something that cannot be studied in a lab and that cannot be predetermined.

&gt;Nope. Heisenberg did NOT declare ...

Wasn't saying he literally said it man. Rhetoric and shit.

&gt;Correct. According to current understanding of physics.

Recommended ages -- ignore them. E.g. Magic: the Gathering has a recommended age of 13+, but I started playing it when I was 4. I couldn't read well and barely knew the alphabet when I started playing, but I really loved the game and forced myself to read the rules and all my precious cards one by one. When I started school, kids were like learning how to pronounce C-A-T, and I knew the D was silent in ""[Djinn](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Handlers/Image.ashx?multiverseid=945&amp;type=card).""

The recommended ages are more like the target audience. There's nothing inappropriate or anything in PG (npi), so there's no way I would look twice at the recommended age, and if your child likes Castles of Burgundy, I think it's at the very least [worth the $25](http://www.amazon.com/Rio-Grande-Games-RGG240-Power/dp/B0007YDBLE) to find out if she likes Power Grid. If she likes it, then it's A) one of the best games ever designed in its own right, and B) has a lot of math problems and even better -- *your ability to solve math problems improves your ability to plan ahead and win the game*. So she'll naturally start doing math problems on her own by playing it.

Just make sure you play the game a few times before you mention anything about math or why you bought it. I know I wouldn't have ever played Magic if my parents said, ""We're worried you can't even read, so here's a rulebook for you to figure out.""

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","True, perhaps I should elaborate. Any employee is entitled to take two weeks off; three after five years of employment. This is UNPAID holiday time. 

On top of that, employees are entitled to 4% of their pay as vacation pay; again, 6% after five years.   This works out to two weeks (three after five years of employment) of PAY for a full time employee. 

Most employers hold your vacation pay and then when you use your holiday time, you get your vacation pay.  Full time employees get roughly as much pay as they would have gotten during their two weeks of vacation time. 

Part time employees, however, don't have enough vacation pay to cover all the holiday time they are entitled to.  For example, If I work half of full time, my 4% vacation pay works out to about one week's worth of pay. I am legally allowed to take two weeks off, but I will only get about one week's pay for that time. 

A full time employee's 4% works out to about two weeks of pay, which covers them for the entire two weeks of time they are legally allowed to take off. 

How much time you work doesn't affect how much holiday time an employer is required to give you off, but it affects how much holiday pay you get.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","haha I almost told you to stay ""positive"" in my first responce but soon though better. Cambodia luckily doesn't have a huge HIV rate. It's not like you slept with a random person in Lesotho. Now that being said, there is absolutely reason for concern, just as if you had unprotected sex anywhere. I would try to keep any correlation with possible symptoms out of your head and just get tested ASAP. If you happen live in the LA area I know that there are many places to get fast and free HIV testing (I'm sure this goes for just about any large metro area but you'll have to do some research.) Or if you're more comfortable seeing a private doctor, then get tested that way. Either way, get tested now and keep calm until you know the results. If you are positive, then keep in mind that HIV is not an automatic death sentence. If you are negative, then celebrate and buy a big ass box of condoms. 

Best of luck and keep us updated if you don't mind doing so.","1383264507"

Don't tell me there's a line-in-the-sand in the frequencies between infra-red and red where ""all humans cannot see the effects of this frequency"", this is a gradient. Just because our eyes can't detect near-IR or IR doesn't mean we can't detect it's effects on other things. 

I question the controlled variable of darkness here. ""Although an object may appear dark, it is likely bright at a frequency that humans cannot perceive."" Just because they cut out the visible frequencies doesn't mean there wasn't a ton of near-infrared going on in that room (especially with those nvg cameras.......) try this same experiment in a cave, and instead of using little cameras with passive near IR to capture eye movement use physical receptors. Cut out the other frequencies (no near-IR, IR, or anything on the spectrum in the environment). Control those variables.

Inversely test if humans can perceive movements in objects not attached to their bodies in near-IR and IR . This would dispel the hypothesis that our mind projects the supposed position of the hand.

I think some of us can perceive infrared, but hardly ever use it because our abundance and reliance on visible.  I'm no expert in the field but I see flaws in the experimental method used, and therefore question the validity and significance of their findings. ","1383264510"

Study the character sheets, or be prepared to spend 5 minutes figuring out every other attack. If you like, you can write down AC of the players to save time. Prepare monster stats well in advance on notecards. I've found one monster a notecard usually keeps things organized.


With inititiative, make sure it's displayed for everyone. They'll help you keep track and can plan their turn.

Be sure to have at least one good NPC conversation/barter/haggle whatever, otherwise your players might not feel engaged.


Go easy on the magic items. 

Yes and! If the players want to do a crazy move, usually let them. If it's like a backflip or something, they basically get one an encounter. But whatevs, it's your game.

Most importantly, you're doing a good job! Your friends are too chicken to try to create a world! They really apreciate/don't want to DM. So, you're in charge. Don't worry about it.

Hello all - sorry I haven't posted in a while. [Did anyone miss me?]

ObPeeve: FINALS! God, I hate them. What a waste of time, when I ...

Ahem, sorry - wrong group.

During finals week I was able to squeeze in a shift at my 'city' job.
Actually, I had no idea I was scheduled - until my beeper went off
and I called the dispatch office:

""Tae, where the FUCK are you?""

I know they like me, I just know it.

I worked the 11pm - 7 am shift in the lovely city of Everett, MA. Or
as some of us call it - 'Ever rot.' A city close to Boston, where
the IROC is king, and an errant cigarette touching the 'spritzed
big-hair' of a woman could cause flashbacks to the days when Michael
Jackson ran around doing his impression of 'the human torch.' I tell
you: if it don't touch the ceiling, it ain't big enough.

An aside: I'm beginning to think there's a 'hairarchy' involved when
several women get together. Obviously, the one with the biggest 'do'
is the alpha female. The postion is tenuous, as the alpha female can
fall to the many natural disasters in the wild: high humidity (bad for
'do'), hair too high (raising center of gravity - instability), and 
the ever-present danger - errant cigarette waving. The ability to chew
many sticks of gum and smoke 'menthol' cigarettes at the same time is
also a good indicator of alpha female material. But I digress ...

The shift started off well: I sat at a Dunky's for about an hour with
my partner, Pam (we call her medic '007' - license to kill), and we
counted the number of cops that came in and got 'Boston creme' donuts
with their coffee - many. I tell you, the best way to 'case' a city -
to see if their police department is 'on the ball' is to hang out at
a donut shop to see how overweight most of them are. Judging by the
girth of most of Everett's finest - I 'suspect' that many crimes could
be committed while the city sleeps, and the cops eat.

The first call of the shift was for a 'diff breather,' a fifty-ish year-
old male experiencing difficulty breathing. Upon arrival, we went up
two flights of stairs to the top floor of a triple-decker. A middle-aged
man was sitting on the floor of his living room, his back against an
easy-chair. His skin color was a dusky blue (positive Smurf-sign), and
he obviously was having a hard time breathing. I reached for his wrist
to check his pulse, while my partner applied an oxygen mask on him. I
listened to his lungs and heard a fine, wet, crackling noise every time
he tried to take a breath. Pulmonary edema. A condition where fluid from
your body gets trapped in the lungs, which slowly starts to fill. It's
kinda like drowning in a swimming pool - only you're in the living room.
That fine crackling noise was the sound of little bubbles of air 
travelling through bronchial tubes filled with fluid. Try rubbing 
together a bit of your hair, near your ear - that's the sound.

Anyway, he wasn't getting any air into his lungs. So the decision was 
made to intubate him in the house. Ah, intubation. The so-called 'fresh-
air pipe,' the 'air piccolo' - this man would be playing it soon. Pam
set up the equipment, and made her first attempt. Since this guy was 
still rather conscious, he objected to her trying to ram the equivalent
of a 'giant Pixie-stick' down his throat, and batted her away. She tried
again - and was rewarded by getting her glasses knocked-off. So it was
my turn. 

He was now on his back, I kneeled near his head, Pam held on to both of
his hands. I slowly inserted the lighted 'blade' that would lift the
fleshy glottis, and illuminate my goal: the trachea. He promptly bit
down on the blade and started to twist his head back and forth. Joy.
Another crew had shown up at this time, and helped hold his head still.
I again inserted the blade, and was rewarded by the man's dinner - now
several hours digested. The menu? - pasta (well-chewed I was happy to
note), some bread, and a rich red marinara, with sun-dried tomatoes. The
heavy, sour smell of partially digested garlic and marinara rose to 
tickle my nostrils. I avoided most of the onslaught by turning his head
to one side, unfortunately the side occupied by Pam, who was holding his
head still for me.

""Thanks a lot, asshole,"" she hissed at me, too soft for the family to
hear.

""But Pam, I thought you liked Italian food."" - her glower deepened.

With all the struggling this man put up, he was beginning to tire. His
oxygen levels weren't that high in the first place, so in a short time,
his struggles lessened enough so that I could pass the tube through his
trachea and into his lungs. I knew I was in the lungs - as frothy white
stuff started to pour out of the tube, and onto the floor. The amount
this man put out was simply amazing. Some of the froth was pink - 
indicating that I caused a 'leetle' trauma to his throat while trying
to pass the tube. Oh well.

We rolled him onto a 'scoop stretcher' and strapped him down, and began
the tedious process of trying to carry this two-hundred pound man down
two flights of stairs. The ironic thing throughout this whole process
was that since he was getting more oxygen now that he was intubated, his
level of consciousness rose - enough for him to get combative again. 

Picture this: four people carrying a man on a flat metal board, the 
man's hands have wiggled free from their restraints, and are trying to
reach and pull-out the plastic tube I just inserted. The people at his
side are trying to re-restrain his hands, but his arms waving wildly
about is causing the center of balance to shift, causing everyone
carrying him to rock back and forth - knocking over lamps and vases. His
wife scurrying this way and that saying ""That's okay, don't worry about
it,"" with every new thing we knock over. _That's_ an EMS call - 'Every
Minute Sucks.'

After hauling him down the stairs, and knocking over some bric-a-brac
on the first floor as well - ""That's okay, don't worry about it,"" we
finally get him into the ambulance - where I turn on the suction unit,
and suction out at least a liters worth of froth from his lungs. 
Cleaning one of these suction units is a pain - fortunately we loaded 
this guy into the other ambulance. Heh - I won't have to clean it.

We get to the hospital. And as we slide him off our 'scoop, we notice
that he has shit himself during transport. A long brown smear covers
our once shiny (and clean) metal board. I guess I have some cleaning to
do as well. Sigh - 'code brown' in progress.

That was call #1. The rest of the shift went downhill. Don't want to
talk about it - yet.

My view on the liberal view on health care is...the usual liberal viewpoint...as long as it doesn't effect me negatively I am for it.  Liberals, to me, are hypocrites; they want change as long as it doesn't effect them.  I am curious as to the conservative viewpoint of health care.  Did you guys bitch about the catastrophe that it is before, or are you just bitching about Obama's plan?  (I am not a Ron Paul libertarian or whatever he is.  I am a guy who just sits back and observes.  I really don't give a shit about voting or parties or any the the bullshit that goes 'round.  My belief is that historical trends happen, and you don't vote your way into overriding these trends.)  So...have you conservative fuckers bitched about the health care system before, and what is your solution?  I don't give a shit about downvotes.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Oh I did. Doesn't change my opinion about this game (I use the term lightly because I'm not even sure I consider it a game. It's more like an interactive story). 

The fact of the matter is there's only about 2 hours or so worth of content, and half of that time you're looking at the same few things.

The (extremely flimsy) story about a story literally doesn't go anywhere at all. Restarting was made to be part of this, and it's really goddamn confusing. Did the game restart because I fucked up, or was that what was supposed to happen? You get no info what so ever, you just get to play those first few minutes over and over again.

And finally, it just looks poor graphically. Now don't get me wrong, HL2 looked pretty back in 2004 when it was released, but by now the source engine is hopelessly outdated. This is fine when it's a mod, which it started out as, but not really acceptable when it's a standalone game that doesn't really have anything else going for it.

This game just tries way too hard to be different, yet forgets all of the things that actually make games fun. I'm all for promoting new and original concepts, but something new and original isn't automatically good.","1383264523"

"news","t5_2qh3l","if that's your opinion then you have a right to it

however, I would add that the church was the only source of stability in europe following the fall of the roman empire, and through its monasteries we have records of what life was like before the dark ages

also, people have been killing each other since the dawn of time. I'm not saying the church is a white knight but it merely devolved it's policies from what people before industrialization would consider ""justice'. 

also, in modern times the USSR, an atheist state, and the US, a capitalist state, have caused far more destruction and death in the past century and a half than the church could ever hope to achieve

once again, I'm not saying the church is good (even though it runs the world's largest and most successful charity programs) but comparatively it is far less evil than even our ""modern"" societies where it's ok to bomb brown people and rape children in juvenile detention centers (and that is not even taking into account the recent trend of Islamic Extremism, which was mostly inadvertently propagated by the US during the cold war)

and, in regards to religion in general, I will refer you to Voltaire, who can be quoted saying ""If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him"". Essentially, religion is an inescapable part of the human experience, even secularists believe in the gods of ""the free market"", of ""technological progress"" and ""social justice for the proletariat"". Religion, organized or not allows for regular ass people to transcend their shitty reality and justify their existence as part of a larger story. (note: most of this is just me paraphrasing Neil Postman's work, I encourage you to read some of his books if you are interested in sociology and theology).

tl;dr religion is inseparable from man, and condemning people for ""believing in a sky fairly"" is about as useful as condemning people for creating civilization and bureaucracy  ","1383264523"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I understand completely what you are saying.  I don't disagree with the concept of what you are saying.  What I am saying is that the costs you are talking about are trivial compared to the costs that I am talking about.   

Additionally there is yet to be a large prospective study which shows that going to the doctor does anything more than increase the number of prescriptions during a lifetime (which again drive up cost).  There have been several studies that demonstrate improved outcomes with frequent visits but in a costs:benefit ratio i haven't seen much.  If you've got some papers to read I'm more than happy to change my position.

Regarding things like asthma, the majority of the patients who are ED frequent fliers have long term management appointments setup at some point (or repeatedly), but fail to go because it isn't a problem for them at that time so why bother.  Compliance turns into the major failure, and with it patient education.  It's a pleasing thought to say we can avoid more problems in the future by spending a little more now, but i haven't seen the evidence.  I want so badly for it to be true.  I manage a lot of chronic asthma and there are so many patients who only care when its a problem and stop all of their controller medications no matter how many follow ups i schedule to tell them otherwise.  I mean, these are kids with repeat ICU admissions and they still can't be bothered to keep an appointment even after we arrange for cab fare. ","1383264524"

You can gain muscle while eating a deficit, but you won't gain overall weight. (Also, it's not possible to 3.5 lbs of muscle in one week.) In other words, to gain overall weight, you have to be eating a surplus.

Most people track their calories. They then eat less than they burn. Over time, they lose weight. Some people exercise also. This makes them burn somewhat more, and also improves their health. It also makes them hungrier, though, so it's a trade-off.

It's not practical to figure out exactly how many calories your body actually burns in a day, known as your total daily energy expenditure (TDEE). However, as a guideline you can use various online calculators that will give you an estimate. You can use that as your starting point.

A lb. of fat has about 3500 calories in it. So, if you ate 500 calories less than you burned every day for a week, you could lose about a lb. of fat.","1383264524"

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","You know, before I knew that I myself was bipolar I lived with a bipolar partner who was off their meds for the entire relationship and while I do not believe that most people with bipolar are dangerous that decision almost cost me my life. 

You do not owe your life to anyone no matter how much you love them or how much they say they love you. 

Be smart.

The very least you can do to protect yourself is keep your own separate place for your own peace of mind. 

That is unless being kicked out repeatedly and calling the cops on somebody you love while they brandish a knife is your idea of fun and you do not value your life or family at all. 

I am not saying that will happen. 

I am saying that it could even if you don't think it will because I never thought for a minute that my loving partner would want me dead, lock me in my own apartment, and threaten to kill me. 

If you truly love this person and they love you then you both need to take your time and wait until they have control of their illness. It sounds like the illness is in control right now. 

I know you are in an emotional spot right now. But honestly, I think you should consider moving on. 

Be careful. 

It can be extremely dangerous to end a relationship with somebody who is suffering from bipolar disorder. 

You should not end the relationship entirely without making sure you have a plan to protect yourself physically. 

I know that may sound excessive or frightening but it has been my own personal experience and I am sharing that with you. 

I don't share it lightly. 

I broke up with my ex in my own apartment and she locked me in and grabbed a kitchen knife and held it to my stomach. 

I was able to convince her to put it down.

Only barely. 

The minute she was out the door I locked it and called the cops. 

If I had to do it again I would have tried to not argue with her at all and end it at a planned time where I would be safe. 

I didn't think a big guy like me had anything to fear. 

I was wrong. ","1383264525"

"kde","t5_2qh6i","I can't say anything about GNOME Shell but maybe something about Unity (however, if I talk to colleagues everyone has different ideas...) 

- I like the menu integration on the top of the screen. At first it is awkward but soon you won't miss it. However it often did not work with Unity. 

- The launch bar on the left side and the dash are also great. Hit Win Key start to type.. you have your document and your application. However I like the KDE menu more at the moment. 

- Unity is far simpler - and is quite good at being simple if it weren't for the bugs. 

- The theme is really good. I like it more than the KDE one. Oxygen is just bad design (IMHO). At the moment I'm quite happy with QtCurve but not so happy. Fonts, Spacing etc.pp Unity got it right. All Apps look similar. 

Things that are strange using KDE again: 

- This idea to have your Desktop in a widget or box or whatever it is called :)... it's maybe nice.. however I just want to work, leave me alone with all this widget configuration stuff on the Desktop (my first reaction, however I'll take a look at again, might be powerful) 

- ~~~No tabs in Dolphin (or I could not find them)~~~ Yeah found them. I'm happy now :) 

- Not really the fault of KDE: If you don't use oxygen you have different UI design for GTK Apps and Qt/KDE Apps... ","1383264530"

Do you think gold is unregulated?  Think about how gold works, that's how bitcoin will have to work.  That is, quite honestly, the absolute best case scenario for bitcoin.

Realistically it's unnecessary as a currency at all.  We seriously do not need it.  But if we're going to use it, it will have to be regulated to gain traction in the commercial world and be offered as an investment from commercial services and to retail investors.  This means that the major countries of the world will need to work (preferably in unison) at adopting bitcoin through legislation that carves out the framework for the industry and provides the necessary regulations to satisfy commercial investors.","1383264531"

"iran","t5_2qhzq","Regardless of whether Radio Free Europe reports on it or not, this is turning into a noticeable issue. Ayatollah Dastgheyb is not a minor, influential figure. Even Khatami made some remarks recently about this phenomenon. 

If anyone can read farsi, these comments by Reyhaane Tabatabei (a journalist), speak best about the situation (imo):

فکر می کنم دست هایی در کار هستند تا ما را نا امید کنند. دو هفته هست که صحبت هایی می شود و اقداماتی صورت می گیرد تا ما را نسبت به رایی که دادیم نا امید کند. انگار که می خواهند ما را نسب به دولت و دولت را نسبت به ما بد بین کنند. اظهارات و اقدامات پرخاشگرایانه و تهاجمی و عصبی گروهی به وضوح یک هدف را دنبال می کند؛ ایجاد شکاف بین ما و دولت و دور کردن ما از یکدیگر، تند کردن فضا و ایجاد یک چالش اساسی بین دولت روحانی و جریان اصلاح طلب و جنبش سبز که خواسته اش از این انتخابات آزادی زندانیان سیاسی و رفع حصر بود. اما خواسته های دیگری هم داشتیم مانند برداشته شدن تحریم ها و حل شدن مشکل اقتصادی کشور. مطمئن هستم که اگر می خواهیم زندانی هایمان آزاد شوند باید مشکلات دیگرمان نیز حل شود و از سوی دیگر برای حل شدن این مشکلات فضای سیاسی باید باز شود و زندانی ها آزاد شوند. این دو مساله در کنار یکدیگر قرار دارند و هیچ کدام جدا از دیگری نیست. توسعه اقتصادی و سیاسی در کنار یکدیگر به رشد و پیشرفت یک کشور منجر می شود.
ار طرفی دیگر این روزها ما هم خسته و عصبی هستیم. چهار سال بر سر آرمان هایمان ایستادیم و نهایت خواسته مان را در پای صندوق های رای متبلور ساختیم. اکنون وقت آن است که کمی آرام بگیریم و صبوری که مهندس میر حسین موسوی گفت را تمرین کنیم.
دست از خواسته هایمان بر نمی داریم. اما خواسته های خود را در کمال صبر و آرامش دنبال می کنیم. نباید اسیر دامی که برایمان پهن کرده اند شویم، دام تند روها، دام جریان جبهه پایداری و خشونت طلبانی که تمام آرزوهایشان در این انتخابات نقش بر آب شد. بیشتر از همه به نظرم باید از پرخاشگری های فیس بوکی دست برداریم. نیاز به آرامش داریم تا بتوانیم خواسته هایمان را دنبال کنیم...بیش از هر چیزی نیاز به زمان داریم، زمان برای بازسازی تمام آنچیز های که در چهار سال گذشته از دست دادیم.","1383264537"

The first couple of days with the patch, you are getting used to new habits and things just feel weird and you might blame the patch on not providing enough nic, but it's just your brain getting used to new things and missing your 'friend'. That's how I describe it anyway. It doesn't feel like nic withdrawls because you are getting plenty of nicotine in reality, but rather your drug addicted brain trying to figure out what to do now with breaks at work, how to drive without smoking, etc. This will pass in a few days as you become more comfortable with non smoking habits. I hope I described this well enough :? But, this is why I'm using the patch so I could deal with relearning my life first and then the drug addiction.

Pilakkad (Entire Wiki entry:  Pilakkad is a village in Thrissur district in the state of Kerala, India.[1])


Denilson pulled his chute at 400 feet, landing hard in the soft green of the fields outside the village. His target: Jeremiah Bandarupalli, ruthless leader of South Indian organized crime, who happened to hail from this tiny village, and was visiting his family. A shame he was least protected here, but there's no way he could have anticipated Denilson's organization knowing of Bandarupalli's past.   
  He cut the line for his chute, removed the rigging, and checked his weapons. The village was dead silent as Denilson walked through the central plaza. Ahead was a larger hut than the others: Bandarupalli's residence. His family had been important figures in the tribe for a long time.   
  Suddenly, Denilson felt a chill down his spine, and glanced quickly to the right. On the of a hut, 100 meters away, a black, hooded figure was watching him. Denilson looked around, and saw more of the black, hooded figures on all the rooftops.  
  
  ""*Ninjas!*"" He exclaimed, raising his fists. The Ninjas drew their swords and jumped to the courtyard below.   
  
  ""You didn't really think I'd fall for your plans, did you Senor Lourenço?"" a voice from behind the ring of ninjas intoned.  
  ""Bandarupalli!""  
  
  ""Excellent skills of deduction there, Senor, but I'm afraid your day has come. Destroy him, my minions!""

When the milk hits the stomach, it gets broken down by the enzymes and forms a semi-solid cottage-cheese type texture. This lets the milk have a chance to be digested and all the nutrients and energy be received. Otherwise the milk would just shoot through, and the poop would indeed be liquid.

If an object reflects a wavelength based on its properties, it will continue to reflect those wavelengths based on it's physical properties. We won't be able to see it but that doesn't mean the object becomes colorless. It means we can't see that color. But that doesn't mean the color ceases to exist.

So to refer back to my original statement: If an object is green (it reflect green wavelengths) it's physical property will continue to reflect that wavelength. If that object is shrouded in black, the object still reflects green wavelengths, only we cannot see it until a light source shines on the object. 

So yes, a green object is still green in pitch black. We only perceive it as having no color. ","1383264548"

"energy","t5_2qhkd","&gt;However, according to Wikipedia, the most promising fuel cycle for fusion requires a combination of deuterium (occurs in nature, easy to recover) and tritium (does not occur in nature in recoverable, meaningful quantities). As far as I know, the only commercial source of tritium production is heavy water reactors (fission)

The plan for fusion reactors would be to breed tritium from lithium, which is fairly readily recoverable.  The idea is that deuterium-tritium fusion produces a high-energy (about 14 MeV) neutron, which escapes the plasma - this needs to be caught by a neutron shield (typically called the ""neutron blanket"") surrounding the plasma, which gains three things:

(1) shielding.  14 MeV neutrons mean a very harsh environment for reactor materials, particularly the superconducting materials needed for the magnetic coils.

(2) power generation.  The neutrons provide a straightforward path for energy out of the reactor - the neutron carries off about 80% of the energy released by a single fusion reaction (with the remaining 3.5 MeV or so carried by an alpha particle, which remains trapped in the plasma).  This energy is absorbed by the blanket along with the neutron, heating it - a simple heat exchanger is then run on the blanket and used to drive a turbine.  It's the world's most complicated way to boil water, but it turns out to be as efficient and *much* cheaper than direct-extraction concepts for plasmas.

(3) tritium breeding, which speaks to your original point.  The neutron blanket will contain lithium, which is a neutron absorber - upon absorbing a neutron, lithium breaks down exothermically into an helium and tritium (for Li-6) or endothermically into helium, tritium, and a free neutron (for Li-7).  Ideally, this means that for every tritium consumed by a fusion reaction, another is produced in the blanket; naturally, there will be losses.  These, however, can be counteracted by neutron multipliers in the blanket.  Blanket concepts for ITER typically target a tritium breeding ratio anywhere from 1.1 to 1.5.

So, to get to your question - a DT-burning fusion reactor would be self-fueling in terms of tritium, with the externally-supplied fuels instead being deuterium and lithium.  You would need a meaningful stock of tritium for startup purposes, which would be supplied by fission reactors (as you noted).","1383264549"

Behind the scenes there's a descriptor file which holds meta data about the vmdk file and then there's the ""flat"" file which is the actual data.  If your descriptor file is damaged you won't be able to attach the disk to a VM even though the data store browser shows you the apparently correct 146 GB vmdk file (the browser generally hides the separate descriptor/flat file from you) 

Someone experienced will need to check from the esxi CLI that both files are in fact present and/or manually fix whatever might be wrong with the descriptor.

Not guaranteeing this is what's happened here but it's my educated guess at a likely cause.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Totally missed that last part of your comment dude. My bad. However, I don't think you explained why decriminalization wouldn't work. I agree that prohibition is certainly not the answer, but you solely provided points as to why prohibition doesn't work. Decriminalization would result in a serious decrease in incarcerations that are linked with substance trafficking/manufacturing, which would conserve quite a lot of time and money in the justice system and greatly reduce the need for prison expenditures and even private prisons. This would not completely take the power away from organized crime, but I would have difficulty justifying passing a law that calls for the legalization of certain substances that have no medical properties whatsoever, are rather damaging to the user, and potentially risk the lives of others. One only has to point in the direction of alcohol and tobacco to see the damage that can be caused by the complete legalization of substances whose consumption does not benefit anyone save the person selling them. These substances, albeit ingrained in our society, place incredible stress on the system with regards to the economic costs of having them so easily and readily available. One could argue that one is the master of one's own self and that one is free to ingest whatever substances they would like, and I would be among those standing by such a belief. On the flip side, I could not morally justify the consumption of drugs when it places others in harms way. You cannot punish someone for doing something that hurts no one, but the same should not be said for someone who does something that can hurt someone else. How can one condone a system that supports the legalization of these damaging substances and claim that allowing a governing body to approve them is better than said governing body disapproving of the ingestion of the substances? Decriminalization allows the government to take a stance that is opposed to the consumption of harmful substances while not penalizing those who are not harming others while under the influence of those substances. My question for you is why is legalization better than decriminalization?","1383264557"

You realize that competitive sports do need rules right? Or else one side can argue there was an advantage to the winner. But the idea of allowing women to fight men is commented upon [here](http://www.lowkickmma.com/UFC/rousey_on_caraway_love_to_beat_him_up_299457). Even the writer believes that women can be the equal of men and Rousey (a female fighter) believes that she can beat a man,  
&gt; Rousey believes, that “with enough technique you can overtake any 
&gt; kind of size...but I personally think I can beat up anybody in the 
&gt; world, but I might get hurt against some people in the process. So, 
&gt; you know, it’s riskier the bigger a person is, but it’s always possible 
&gt; with good technique.”

Maybe I am thinking too far into it. It shouldn't be a chore for her and I don't want her to feel like it is. I just feel like we could have conversations that would help us both gain an understanding of each others desires as well as our own.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'm guessing it's only simple and obvious IF you've already solved problems like this. I've been solving simple to complex problems in both engineering and design for 32 years now and this problem seems purely arbitrary.

Frankly, I haven't spent 1 calorie to solve this but imagine if I were motivated to solve this, it wouldn't be hard.

The problem is I cannot tell very much about how you think by giving you puzzles. Unless, of course, you're job is a puzzle and riddle solver.

Here's a more real world problem: You have a user who runs a process on your website that takes minutes when you know it should take seconds. How do you go about troubleshooting the problem and eventually fixing it?

That's completely open-ended leaving plenty of room for learning about how the applicant thinks. And it's more realistic WITH NO RIGHT ANSWER.

Problems with no right answer tell me more about the applicant than the question that Twitter asked. In fact, I'd be so bold (and perhaps wrong) to say that anyone who would ask this type of question should examine their ego.

"TheRedPill","t5_2ve1u","&gt;Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, in their book critiquing postmodern thought (Fashionable Nonsense, 1997), criticize Luce Irigaray on several grounds. In their view, she wrongly regards E=mc2 as a ""sexed equation"" because she argues that ""it privileges the speed of light over other speeds that are vitally necessary to us"".[citation needed] They also take issue with the assertion that fluid mechanics is unfairly neglected because it deals with ""feminine"" fluids in contrast to ""masculine"" rigid mechanics. In a review of Sokal and Bricmont's book, Richard Dawkins[5] wrote that, ""You don't have to be a physicist to smell out the daffy absurdity of this kind of argument (...), but it helps to have Sokal and Bricmont on hand to tell us the real reason why: turbulent flow is a hard problem (the Navier–Stokes equations are difficult to solve).""

That was pure gold! Thanks for the laugh! She obviously knows nothing about fluids or the Navier-Stokes equations. Turbulent flow is one of the seven hardest math problems in the world, and if someone could solve the Navier-Stokes equations, [they would win $1,000,000.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems)","1383264563"

Indeed! One thing I mention in the Short Tower video is that virulence and resilience are very often peripheral to questions of truth (or ""*actual* tower supremacy""). That's why, if we're concerned about truth (and other cool things, like directed utility), we have to train ourselves to watch out for these patterns.

This sentence is true: ""What's popular is not always right, and what is right is not always popular."" But that sentence being true does **not** make the following sentence true: ""What's unpopular is always right, and what is right is always unpopular.""","1383264569"

Why? because I do think you need AV, there are more ways than just browsing to get viruses... email attachments, removable media, file transfers all these things could pose risks... Having up-to-date AV is a must.


Now as far as the whitelisting side... if you can, go for it... however depending on the environment (difficult users, managerial support, size)  this may not work for long. You could put a content filtering device (sonicwall, untangled, something) in place or even move to a DNS service that filters malicious sites, OpenDNS comes to mind as I type but I am sure there are more.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Tailgate

Speaking of post-cardiac arrest vomiting..            
I remember several years ago when I received a call for a man having ""chest pain."" The call location was at a local chinese restaraunt - in the lovely town of Winthrop, MA (aka Win-throw-up, by local EMS providers). The man did not look good: mid-fifties, 275 lbs., pale, sweaty, grey. Laid out in front of him were the remains of a HUGE meal.

While my partner asked the patient questions, I asked where the others at his table were. This I assumed because of the simply ENORMOUS amount of food at the table. The waiter looked at me and said ""no one else."" Right then and there, I should have grabbed my partner, walked outside, stomped my portable radio, and call the dispatcher by telephone to say that I hadn't received any radio transmission. But, *sigh* the police and fire departments arrived - witnesses, so I had to stick around.

Anyway, looking at the cardiac monitor, and judging by his physical present-\ ation, it was a good bet that he was having a heart attack. We loaded him into the ambulance (I could have sworn I heard my spine go *pop* while I did this) and away we went to the hospital. We were in the Sumner Tunnel (or was it the Callahan? - I get 'em mixed up) when I (yeah, guess who had to sit in back with him) noticed his heart was beating erratically. Then he started to flop around, and then went limp. I looked at the monitor - not good - saw a ""shockable"" rhythm, checked the patient's pulse - not present. So I grabbed the paddles, and gave the man 200 joules of kick-juice. Mind you - it's not like in the movies - they don't ""bounce"" off the table. The freshest I've seen is the arms flap up in a brief ""hallelujah"" - the damn medic did some- thing right!

Which reminds (I digresss) about another time when I shocked or ""defibbed"" - for those in the know - a patient in cardiac arrest - this was on a street corner, this woman comes up and says ""I'm a nurse, do this - this and this"" Uh, sure. I called ""clear"" before shocking, actually several times as this ""nurse"" did not stand back far enough - she was still crouched near one of the patient's arms. So I shocked and the patient's arms did a ""halle- lujah"" one hand shooting up into this woman's crotch. God what a jump! I'd give it a 8.5. But getting back to the other story where I kill someone... 

So I look at the monitor, and after a few seconds (monitor has to re-center itself) - flatline, a couple seconds more... one beat, followed by a couple more, eventually up to speed. The patient opens his eyes, turns his head towards me, and without as much as a by-your-leave, pukes the entire contents of his eight course lunch on my lap. Well, not the entire contents - I did have presence of mind to swivel out of his way and grab a plastic bucket and hold it under his chin - at an angle of course, so that his next launch richoccets off the bottom of the bucket and back into his face (give a little get a little.) He is STILL puking after several minutes. I can recognize certain dishes - I don't think he alternated dishes at all. Mushi pork, pork strips, lobster sauce (still looked the same), and my favorite - chicken fingers with red sauce and rice. Yum. He also brought up remnants of some Italian pasta dish (breakfast?) and in the middle of my second bucket 'o puke sitting on top this gastronomical trip around the world, is half of a meatball that clearly was not chewed at all.

Great, I'm stuck in tunnel traffic, it's a hot summer day, no A/C, and I'm covered in puke. I'm beginning to get a little heevy myself - so I tell my partner to speed it up. Finally the traffic breaks, most of the cars pull over to the right and we zip back and forth into the lanes. While I sit there feeling this warm liquid and chunk surprise reach past my outer layer of clothes to my skivvies, I notice that a car is tailgating us - weaving in and out of traffic. This was too much - doesn't he realize that only *WE* can drive like assholes (and get paid for it?) I open one of the back doors of the ambulance, and heave a bucketful Three Delights onto this guy's windshield

Totally unexpected, the guy actually slows down! But only for an instant - he turns on his windshield wipers, and continues to follow! This time just barely out of launch range - they adapt well these drivers. I guess he was not amused, as he followed me all the way to the hospital. We radioed ahead for the police, and when we got to hospital, he was cited for following an emergency vehicle too closely. His retort - ""THAT guy threw a bucketful of PUKE on my car!"" Police response:""Why do you think this law exists?"" - 

Love that guy. Anyway, the patient survives, everyone at the hospital avoids me, I'm out of spare uniforms back at the base, the guy that followed me called my company to complain, and I got suspended for day. I even had to sign a letter promising never to throw puke out of the back of a moving ambulance again. But, hey, it was worth it.

"redsox","t5_2qh95","I’m assuming the Red Sox are going to go ahead and make qualifying offers to Drew, Ellsbury, and Napoli. If Salty's out, AJ Pierzynski might be a good stopgap option to spell Ross for some games. If Drew re-signs, that probably means Middlebrooks is on the trade block. I can’t see any free agents being signed outside of the organization, but Mark Trumbo might be cheap alternative to Carp. Why would he be cheap (relatively speaking)?

Pitching! We’ve got tons of it. There’s three guys in the rotation that are probably untouchable: Lester (because of his performance), and Dempster/Peavy (because of their contracts). What will be interesting to see is what Cherington does with Buchholz, Lackey, and Doubront. Buchholz’s value is probably relatively high: coming off a 12-1 season, with an impressive 1.74 ERA, and will likely see his $6m team option get picked up. Would a team that misses out on Price or Scherzer be interested in gambling on Buchholz? Lackey and Doubront also have significant trade value: Lackey for his league minimum option, and Doubront for being a young, lefthanded starter with a couple of high strikeout seasons on his resume. The Red Sox have some high ceiling guys in the wings (De La Rosa, Webster, Workman), so all three of those guys are expendable to some degree: perhaps they could be part a package for Max Scherzer? (Pipe dream).

Looking at the bullpen, you’d have to imagine Ben is going to decline Matt Thornton’s option and offering arbitration to Franklin Morales. If Workman returns to being a starter (either in Pawtucket or Boston), that leaves room for Bailey to reclaim his spot as the right-handed power guy. I could also see the Red Sox offering Joel Hanrahan a modest deal to come back, though perhaps that sixth bullpen spot (after Uehara, Tazawa, Bailey, Miller, and Breslow) should go to someone who can pitch multiple innings.

Looking at the roster, I think we’d at least be looking at wild card contention, even if the team doesn’t make any moves or re-sign any of our free agents. Should be a fun offseason!

Think of it this way: you buy a house for 200,000, and make payments, but not enough, and the interest on the house means your debt keeps growing. First year, it's 210,000. Second year, 220,000, third year, 230,000 in debt. That would be bad right? Well, what about the value of the house? If the house's value goes up *more* than the value of the debt, you're still making money. If by the third year, the value of the house is up 50% to 300,000, then you've just made 70k, while incurring more debt.

Government spending is like this. We spend more than we make, because spending sometimes means more growth than we've spent. We call that an economic multiplier. Bigger economy means better jobs, higher wages, more companies doing business, and thus the government makes more in taxes, and the people are all happier than they were the previous year.

"LSD","t5_2qhvj","LSD Psychoanalyst – The loosening of your ego structure enabled strongly repressed feelings to emerge.  These feelings of profound guilt, fear, and self-destructiveness reflect conflicts that are generating a tremendous amount of “friction”, to use energetic terms.  This energy is typically maintained below the surface of consciousness (I wonder if your dreams are or have recently been unusual – and suggest that you begin to keep a notebook by your bed and write down your dreams before stepping out of bed – flashlight is handy for this) and it overpowered you when your repressive guard was down.

Advice: See a therapist once a week to discuss, keep a dream journal, if conventional therapy does not progress to your satisfaction after a couple of months, only consider LSD in microdoses as an adjunct to therapy, or at higher doses with a very experienced sitter in a well-controlled environment.  You need to become conscious of these conflicts to reduce the friction they are creating within your unconscious mind.  Friction = inflammation = you destroying yourself

Neurophysiologist – The default mode network’s attenuation as the result of the drug administration resulted in strong activation in the amygdala and temporal lobes, typically associated with affect and memories and other visualization.  The cascading fear/anger response resulted in eventual sedation by hospital staff – likely benzodiazepine.  

Advice: Excluded/Can not participate in any further studies without an experienced therapist available.

Joseph Campbell/Carl Jung:  You got knocked down by a powerful wave generated by the tidal forces of your unconscious.  The shaman swims in the ocean that the psychotic drowns in…and for some time you were drowning.  Thankfully, you may not be predisposed, per se, to psychosis, but the risk of being overwhelmed by what appears to be very strong currents is high.  To make the perilous journey back into the depths of your own unconscious, you will need a guide amongst the living…because in the depths lies the beyond/out-side-of life.

Advice: Find safety in water – best option for this right now is an experienced life guard.

Directive therapist:  You have very strong and unacceptable feelings – feelings that you dare not express, given your obligations, oaths and morals…which must weigh very heavily upon you.  As the difference/dichotomy between your real and ideal selves increases, the disruption to your life will increase, in the form of unwanted and seemingly “not you/alien” impulses, feelings and possibly actions.  Consider the LSD experience a blessing – that you got an early warning…and that you can still choose to at least accept the conflicts and identify their origin, but more importantly, their functional autonomy (i.e. the conflict arose in childhood but continues to affect you as an adult, completely independent of its origin).

Advice: Seek ways of feeling these unsafe feelings before they emerge painfully and maladaptively of their own accord, ultimately overcoming even your most strident resistance, typically in a moment of weakness/illness or general exhaustion.


Ta-da!  

TL/DR – you got’s mad feelings, yo…and you need to feel those feelz before you straight trip

Stimulus is effective when money gets spent instead of saved. People who are poor are the people who are most likely to spend any stimulus money they receive - that's why things like unemployment and food stamps [are among the best stimulus for an economy in a recession](http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/29/news/economy/stimulus_analysis/).

"AskElectronics","t5_2se13","You're in the right track in making a filter using an LC circuit. Just note, though, that you'll be making a very tight bandpass filter, depending in the resistance of your inductor and capacitor.

To give you some direction: Start with looking up an RLC filter. Then just eliminate the R, and you'll get a very tight LC bandpass filter (make sure it's band*pass*, not band*stop*!). You can easily calculate the frequency based on the L and C values. I suggest utilizing a series LC filter since the L and C will cancel each other out at a specific frequency, making a bandpass filter, not a bandstop filter.

About levels - your CD player will generally output around a volt RMS and can push maybe 1/8W of power. If you hook up the output of your CD player into the input of your filter, then the output of your filter into the input of an audio power amplifier, you'll be just fine. Your currents through your filter will be quite small, maybe a few mA.

Hopefully that will send you in the right direction! Feel free to PM me if you have more questions.","1383264585"

Please don't romanticize the idea of taking a road trip in Japan, most Japanese themselves avoid road trips and fly or take the train. 

While I agree that a car may not be ideal for OPs plans, I wouldn't write off road trips in Japan. The cost can be offset by using only non-toll roads. It may add some time to your trip but non-toll roads are almost always more scenic.

Do you think a ten year old new to the show knows that? Or do you think the kid will ask, hey, why doesn't Ash just throw the pokeball right away? OH THATS WHY. BECAUSE ITS EASIER TO CATCH THEM WHEN THEY'RE WEAKENED. LESSON LEARNED.

If that's what turns you off from watching the show, that's fine. Again, you're not gamefreak's target audience. Now, Pokemon Origins WAS meant for you. It was a classic journey for the nostalgists and older pokefans. It showed a trainer who grew throughout his journey, and who became an actual pokemon master.

In conclusion: Ash isn't meant to be the pokemon master we aspire to become, Ash is meant to be a kid who loves pokemon, loves making friends, and learns to make moral decisions in life.

Hmmmm... Reminds me of a call I once did - gots to be short - finals.            
My partner and I were driving in the beautiful city of Chelsea, MA, looking for stray animals or small children to run over. We received a call for an MVA - truck vs. bike. Upon arrival, we found a biker with half his body underneath a truck. He wasn't trapped, he'd seen the impending collision, and being a skilled biker, was able to 'dump' his bike before impact, avoiding a head-on collision with the truck. During the course of this, he slid under the truck. When we got on scene, he showed some classic signs of shock (pale, sweaty, rapid pulse/low bp) and after we immobilized him on a long-board, we began to break the news to him - his leather had to be cut. Now I don't know if you've met any bikers (I only meet them when they get into 'accidents') but they absolutely _love_ their leather, and _hate_ having it cut. I began to explain to the guy that we'd have to cut his leather jacket and pants off - and to my surprise he readily agreed, which clued me in to how 'crappy' this guy really felt. My partner started in on the pants, and I started to cut his jacket. I got to his t-shirt, quickly cut that to bear his chest to listen to his lungs and check chest wall stability. I stopped cold when I saw his tattoo: two rectangular dotted-lines one right below his right clavicle the other near the lower left rib cage, with the words 'place paddles here' written in each center. I started to laugh, and my partner looked over, then she started to laugh. When the biker figured out what we were laughing at, he said 'just thought I'd help you guys out' and also started to laugh - until he passed out and pissed himself. The guy survived - sans spleen and 1/3 liver, but man what style!

If I ever get a tattoo, I'll shave a small patch of hair off my scalp, then have someone tattoo '666' on the bare patch - then let the hair grow back out. Then I won't tell anyone about it. Let'em figure it out.

 If you think you're one of the smartest young people in the world at the moment, then you dropping out in the past and being slightly nontraditional will not stop you from getting in. What will keep you from getting in is not being smart enough. You'd have to be a genius, and you'll be competing with thousands of self taught video game developers that are WAY more skilled than you. MIT level students don't struggle with teaching themselves anything. Anywhere you go computer science is mostly self taught. That's just the way the subject is. You saying your level of development isn't so great but you're going to go to MIT is like saying you don't know how to sing but you're going to put out a platinum album tomorrow.

But hey, give it a shot I guess. But you should definitely apply to more realistic places. Just a heads up, a lot of universities are getting rid of their game development degrees because it's an awful industry to get into and it's more useful and less risky to get a computer science degree.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Yes they did - if they didn't think it was worth anything they didn't use it. Prior to the 20th century pretty much all currencies either were backed by gold or were coins made of metal (which have intrinsic melt values).

Non-backed paper currency something of a marvel of modern economics. Through careful management and a faith in the government we've managed to create currencies which have no intrinsic value, but people continue to use them simply because they believe they are valuable.

You accept payment in dollars (or whatever currency) because you know that you can turn around and spend that at the shop. The shop accepts it because they know they can pay it as wages, the workers accept it because they know they can spend it. It's kind of like when you do those team building exercises where everybody sits down on each other's laps in a circle. It works so long as everybody does it.

Of course there have been some instances where the system *hasn't* worked, precisely because people have a say in the matter. Take a look at Zimbabwe, the government prints money, pumps it into the economy to the point where the value of any single bill drops to nothing and the economy goes into freefall. Nobody told the people of Zimbabwe that their currency was worthless (indeed, if they had continued as usual there wouldn't have been a problem), they came to that conclusion on their own and en mass.","1383264598"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","No, the basic reason why not is called compression. In compression, like a file format for pictures, the picture that you see is not all the picture you took. A good analogy is painters. Your painter (the camera) took a perfect(ish) picture, and passed it to your computer (or a hard drive etc.). However, your computer can't store it all, the painter can't make it fit. So he paints a smaller picture like a postcard and he keeps that. 

Now, when you printscreen, he makes a new picture from the old one (decompression), however, when he made the first one it lost some detail, the eyes are too small, the lines are off, etc. Now he needs to either bring back what he can (lossy compression) though it's bad quality, store a bigger one in the first place (lossless compression), or fill in the blanks (reprocessed compression). 

A printscreen is pretty unlikely to be lossless, though even lossy compression must not be perfect, as entropy comes into play due to the thermodynamics of the information storage.

TL;DR Printscreen won't copy as well as a camera takes pictures","1383264601"

"Torontobluejays","t5_2sb61","The thing is, our three biggest problems are interrelated.

We have unhealthy strikeout pitchers, and a third that relies on a method that on any given night is literally hit-or-miss.

BUT, our catching can't call the pitches and play strong defense behind the plate, and our 2nd basemen can't play a lick of defense.  So the problems arise directly related to the pitching become obvious...

Our pitchers can't throw anything but strikes down the middle b/c the catcher can't catch, and if they wanted to throw it so the hitters get into ground outs, they can't b/c our defense is either going to throw it away or not reach it in time.

So when you look at our problems, we need to upgrade all three s that we don't have to rely on 2nd basemen that can't defend, and catchers that can't defend, and thus, force pitchers to throw nothing but strikes and not get creative...thus resulting in an oft-injured pitching staff.","1383264602"

I wasn't aware that this specific comparison had been posted before (thanks for taking the time track down the link). I did some due diligence before posting in an attempt to avoid this very thing. Had I known I wouldn't have wasted the time on the tables or the effort in making the post - no deliberate stealing of ideas here. I just figured this would be a little variety from the usual rotation of:

* I have condom problems -&gt; answer: use bigger ones. Try TheyFit.
* Question about dick growth -&gt; answer: no one knows if it will grow more.
* Can't fit inside SO -&gt; answer: lube/foreplay

I'm by no means a statistician. I have a working knowledge of statistics as I feel it's basic knowledge that adults should have. I am aware I wasn't using the term average properly, but this was in an effort to use more common terms. Given the confusion that statistics seems to bring in general, somewhat to my surprise, I can imagine using ""median"" would have worsened it. I'd like to add that while incorrect, I was trying to be consistent with the wording used in hungfun's tables. It doesn't make my use right, but there was some logic to it.

I had intended on entirely redoing the first post to present the whole thing in a more understandable manner, but given the confusion already caused and the previous post on the same topic it doesn't really seem worth the effort.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","Yeah, this'll depend on state. A lot of places divide sex offenders into tiers within the registry. These are calculated using a point system that takes into account the severity of the offense committed, as well as current lifestyle conditions. Those points, and subsequently the tier you're placed in, *can* be challenged and updated.

Example: In our hypothetical jurisdiction, Tier III sex offenders get put on the internet for anybody to look up. But Tier II sex offenders are known only to police and the principals of local elementary schools. Maybe when you got put on the list, you were unemployed and single.  If you're now married and employed, you can petition the court to re-evaluate where you are in life and see if maybe some points should get knocked off and you deserve to go into a lower tier. This happens regularly.

&gt; Show that they've never been in trouble with the law since or anything like that?

Again, it depends on the jurisdiction. A lot of places will take you off the list after a decade or so if you haven't committed any crime since, and you can convince the court that you aren't a continuing threat. People who commit *really* heinous acts might never be allowed off the list, even if they've been angels ever since.","1383264606"

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","I'm not sure I've ever had to care about the golden ratio while programming, other than when solving math problems specifically involving it.  You can obviously write programs to compute the golden ratio (you'd want to use the Fibonacci series to do it, probably), and if you need to know exact values of the sines and cosines of certain angles it could be vaguely useful, but I really can't see a reason why you'd need those exact values for something.

The only thing I can think of is that it might come up in some *very* specific calculations of the running time of recursive algorithms.  But it's got to be *very* specific, so you're unlikely to come across it in the wild, honestly.","1383264607"

What's different? Here are some changes off the top of my head.

* Faster processor which is more power efficient. Faster GPU too

* Bigger screen (~5"")

* Higher resolution (1920x1080)

* Glass is Gorilla Glass 3 which is supposed to be stronger. We'll see

* Better camera (Sensor is supposed to be better and it has OIS)

* LTE

* Better speakers (twice as many and none are on the back)

* Battery *may* be better. We'll have to see.

* Audio out is supposed to be better

* USB OTG (not completely sure on this one)

* Probably no heat issues with thermal throttling

I'm sure there are more but these are the big ones. It's a good upgrade, but not groundbreaking. The Nexus 4 is still a really solid phone.","1383264610"

Let me explain: these houses have front yards that cannot be fenced (laws), plus a shared staircase and walkway.  So I can't enclose the access for the animal without breaking laws and impeding my neighbors access.

The only other rear door is in the basement - and it exits directly into my driveway and then the shared-common rear-access road (which is HEAVILY used by all owners, as we much park in the rear).  Therefore, the rear has about 50 or 60 feet before you reach my rear 'yard'.  And you can't build a runway for the dog because it would cross what is essentially a road.  

This is my first time doing this... so I hope it works.

Not my house. You can't see my property due to trees. But can you see how the back of the properties are car spaces? And then a road?  and THEN the green green grass?  There's no way to create a connection that the pet can access.  They are always 'crossing a road'... and you can imagine how some people drive.  I would never risk it.

I completely agree with checking for batteries due to their hazardous nature, but FT has always (at least in my experience) shipped batteries decently.  I only order good, safe batteries (but they sell shit ones too), and they always come in a plastic snap box.  However, they have had more than 50% charge when I received them.


It's a shame that shitty companies have to ruin it for everyone by tossing in loose batteries into a box, or some other clearly unsafe method of packaging.  I received an order from VaporBreak exactly like that.  Two shit, unbranded 18350 batteries just rolling around in a box.  I was amazed when I opened it; such a stupid thing to do.


Moreover, it's absurd that FT and other companies are still trying to sell and ship batteries, regardless of the ban.  It's akin to a vaper being respectfully told they cannot vape in a restaurant, and then going up to the owner to blow a huge cloud directly in his face.  Really?  All they've done is bring down their entire postal system to a near halt.

1) The false dichotomy that an expansion of such powers is necessary to prevent terror strikes - such powers don't guarantee the prevention of attacks. In fact, it's to be assumed that potential offenders will circumvent tracking/surveillance mechanisms.

2) OP overlooks the abuse that is *already* occurring with expansions in current technology - Snowden's revelations show that there are systemic problems with oversight and deterrence mechanisms, and that there is systemic abuse of intelligence powers.

3) Flawed argument for investigative secrecy. The greatest purpose of secrecy is to prevent the massive backlash and opposition that would be raised if policies and practices became transparent. It's simply an intelligence community resistance to oversight and checks to their power. 

This fellow needs to look back into history to see the Intelligence Dossier abuses that occurred under, and following Edgar Hoover. The media/police targeting of OWS protestors is illustrative of the significant power imbalance between the public and specific vested economic/political interests. Lastly, if these policies are so necessary and balanced, why are the leaders so vehemently opposed when they are targeted?

It depends on where you live. When I was little, every year up until I was 12, we had no parental supervision on Halloween with a curfew of 10pm. We lived in a sprawling sardine-packed suburb and went trick-or-treating as a pack of about twenty kids. In hindsight, we basically supervised ourselves by virtue of at least one of us being recognized no matter which door we knocked on or which side street we used as a shortcut. Also, numbers. No pedophile is going to fuck with a group of kids that big.","1383264621"

: Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is damn fascinating. L-N babies are born with teeth and

Well, since Mr. Davies so soundly trounced my ability to differentiate between cold and flu viruses, as well as pus and mucus, let me try to redeem myself.

Hypoxanthine-Guanine Phosphoribosyltransferase Deficiency

(Lesch-Nyhan Syndrome)

Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) is the enzyme that converts the purine bases hypoxanthine and guanine to inosine monophosphate (IMP) and guanosine monophosphate (GMP), respectively, and the X-linked recesive disorder due to its complete deficiency is characterized by central nervous system dysfunction and purine overproduction with hyperuricemia and hyperuricosuria. Depending on the residual activity of the mutant enzyme, male hemizygotes may be severely retarded and show choreoathetosis, spasticity, and compulsive, mutilating lip and finger biting, or they may present with only gouty arthritis and urate ureterolithiasis. The enzyme deficiency can be demonstrated in erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and cultured amniotic cells; this disorder can thus be diagnosed with certainty in utero.

Some characteristics of X-linked recessively inherited diseases:

1) Affected individuals are nearly always males
 2) The mother is usually the carrier. She transmits the disease to half of her sons; i.e., there is a 50% chance that each of her sons will be involved. She may on occasion show mild symptoms of the disease.
 3) One-half of a carrier mother's daughters will be carriers. All of the affected father's daughters will be carriers.
 4) The uninvolved sons do not transmit the disease.
 5) There is no father-son transmission.

Although the cause of the central nervous system dysfunction on Lesch-Nyhan syndrome remains obscure, the absent or less severe central nervous system manifestations of purine nucleoside phosphorylase deficiency (in which HPRT is functionally inactive because of lack of substrate) suggest that the problem relates to accumulation of substrate behind the block.

Allopurinol and probenecid may be given to reduce hyperuricemia, but they do not affect neurologic status. Insertions of the HPRT gene into cultured cells from affected patients and into experimental animals have been effective and offer promise as models for human gene therapy in the future.

ObTGlossary: choreoathetosis

A derangement marked by ceaseless occurence of slow, sinuous, writhing movements, especially severe in the hands, and performed involuntarily.

One of the root words for choreoathetosis is chorea, which reminds me of an ObT:

One Thanksgiving I responded to a call for a 'woman with slashed wrists.' Upon arrival, my partner and I found a woman in her mid-forties, wearing nothing but a kitchen apron, in the kitchen of her apartment. A neighbor told before we entered the apartment that the woman had 'Huntington's chorea.'

Huntington's chorea: a relatively common autosomal dominant disease charactertized by chronic progressive chorea (see above) and mental deterioration terminating in dementia. Death usually follows within fifteen years of diagnosis.

Of course, I didn't know that back then.

When we entered the kitchen there was the woman, wearing only an apron that had 'Kiss the Chef' silk-screened on it; one of her wrists had a large laceration that was bleeding profusely. She paid us no mind, as she was busy stuffing a large turkey with the contents of an entire jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. To make things worse, she was using her injured wrist, and the turkey was covered with clotty, congealing blood, with the mayonnaise stuffing a dark pink color.

We tried to convince her that it was okay to leave the turkey behind and to accompany us. We almost had her on the stretcher when my partner remarked:

""There'll be other Thanksgivings ...""

In retrospect that was probably not the thing to say to a woman who knew her death was possibly a few years away. Anyway, with a load screech she broke away from us and ran back into the kitchen. We chased her into the kitchen only duck for cover as she hurled the turkey-mayo-blood bomb at us. Luckily, she bought a large turkey and wasn't able to throw it accurately; missing us completely, but hitting the wall next to us. The impact of the turkey *squeezed* the blood and mayo from the depths of the bird, splattering the floor. We had to wrestle her to the ground and strap her to the stretcher - which wasn't easy as we all had mayonnaise on us by that time. To think other people pay for this kind of thing.

No worries, I just wasn't sure if there was something I was perhaps missing a salient point regarding hormones/transitioning.  

I completely agree that the erasure of and/or widespread hostility towards non-binary identities necessarily situates them in a non-privileged position, and I wouldn't say that non-binary individuals are a privileged group.  But as you say, the ultimate way of determining privilege is how it manifests itself in real life, in the context of how society treats members of certain groups.  So in short, a genderqueer person does not have privilege on account of their genderqueerness (i.e. genderqueer or non-binary privilege does not exist), but they may have access to some amount of male privilege if indeed they are perceived and treated as male, but this is entirely contingent upon that perception and treatment by others, not anything inherent in the gq individual's identity.  Does that make sense?

With regards to ad hominem arguments, I just think it's intellectually lazy to disregard an argument purely based on whose argument it was.  One can dismiss an argument because it's logically unsound, but not because it happens to come from a particular sort of person.  I think it's important to take the identity of the speaker into account, of course, in order to contextualize it and to determine whether the speaker has very much authority on the topic at hand, and what sort of priority their voice should be given compared to other speakers on that topic.  Sadly, it often ends up being true that people with very little relevant experience or knowledge of the topic like to spout harmful opinions that are grounded in myth and misinformation, or else derail the discussion or turn it into a self-praising speech about allies, and that these sorts of speakers like to try and take up a lot of time and space in discussions they have a very limited understanding of, but I think the criticism needs to be focused on the opinion itself and the weakness in the argument, not on who is saying it.

|**about artist**|Elevate were a short-lived but inventive guitar-based band, formed in London in 1993. They released two albums (Bronzee, 1994 and The Architect, 1996) and several singles on Robin Proper-Sheppard's Flower Shop Records. Musically, they sit somewhere between The Fall and Slint, while always ploughing their own very particular, and very British, furrow.  Elevate bring out the grimmer aspects of indie-noise in comparison to the likes of early Sonic Youth and Girls Against Boys. The band split up in 1997.

Not even close. ARRA's spending was spread out over several years. In 2009 only $114 billion was spent from it. http://www.cbo.gov/publication/42682

Most of the deficit in 2009 was due to lower tax receipts and higher mandatory entitlement outlays due to the massive economic recession that had just occurred. From  http://www.epi.org/publication/ib262/

&gt;These growing federal deficits are the result of four primary factors: the 2001 and 2003 tax changes; the external effects of the current recession; increased Bush-era spending, including spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; and the various short-term responses to the recession, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) and financial market bailouts. The recession itself is the most important cause, responsible for just under half of the deterioration. The ARRA constitutes less than a tenth of the total deterioration since 2001.

Just a note for the future, if you have a regular 28-31 day cycle (which it sounds like you usually do), having unprotected sex 2 weeks after your period is like EXACTLY when to do it if you're TRYING to get pregnant.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","Title: Vein

A Very Close Vein, Indeed            
I remember once I was working in lovely Somerville, MA., when I got a cal for a ""man bleeding."" When we got to the address, there was no patient to be seen. I was about to clear with dispatch, when my partner said, ""Hey, look on the ground."" There was a large puddle of blood right outside the entrance to the train station. And before you all say ""damn your asian eyes"", I'd like to add that it was late evening and I was very tired. This was not just a puddle, no, it was a trail of blood, winding down several blocks. I followed the trail on foot, while my partner followed in the truck, while the fire department followed in their truck, and the police had gone to the ""Dunky's"" and told us they would come back. This scene reminded me of one similar in the movie ""Roxanne"" where Steve Martin leads the entire fire department to a burning building on foot.

Several blocks later, the trail leads to a house. We stop at the front door, and marvel at the puddle that was there (guess the person was looking for his keys). We didn't know WHY the person was bleeding, so we waited for the cops to come back. Then we knocked on the door, no answer. Finally the cops do a ""forced entry"" (translation: they kicked the door in). More blood trails, leading down a corridor and up several flights of stairs, which finally ends up to a closed door. The police knock, and a male voice answers: ""Who's there?"" After identifying themselves, they enter. We open the door to find a 50-ish male, with varicose veins on both his legs. He apparently nicked one of them on his ankle while leaving the train station, and didn't feel it. I guess it happens quite often to him. He looks down, and says ""not again.""

By the way, there was a HUGE puddle of blood near his feet, and a stream of blood shooting out of the vein. For a brief second, this reminded me of a ""Monty Python"" sketch (you know the one, if don't, watch the Holy Grail movie). As I step past him to place a pressure dressing on his leg, I slip on the puddle, and fall on my ass into it. The firefighters (being the compassionate guys they are) start laughing at me. The patient was nice enough to swivel his leg away from me so that now the stream of blood is spraying one of the walls. As my partner and I carried this man down several flights of stairs, the firefighters kept laughing, until they found out that they had to re-trace this patient's path and spray away all the blood on the sidewalk (goddamn rubber-men). They stopped laughing then.

We transport the patient to the hospital, and the nurse at the triage desk looks at me, and says ""was he shot?"" ""No, it's just a varicose vein."" ""Well, the bleeding must have stopped by now."" and she move to unwrap the dressing. ""I wouldn't if I were you."" ""I know what I'm doing."" She unwraps the last of the gauze, and lifts the gauze pad and a stream of blood shoots out and hits her in the face and chest. It's times like these when I *love* my job.

Anyway, on my way back to the base, I have to sit on several towels, and I feel that cool ooze slowly drying to a sticky mass on my butt. Joy.","1383264639"

It is in no way comfortable at all, though it's not too bad if I have 3"" heels on.  A 2"" heel is do-able, but not for long.

I've had a desk job for about 15 years, with only sporadic and very unfocused exercise over the years so I'm pretty sure there's plenty of flexibility issues.  Sitting down all day is apparently very bad for you.  This is the first time I've every been methodical about having goals and having some idea of how to achieve them.  Unfortunately, I have no way of getting video of my form.  Maybe over Christmas when I go home.","1383264643"
"TheBluePill","t5_2vzvv","I feel you. I've had my first kiss and first girlfriend pretty late and my dating and love life was (and still is) mired in awkwardness. But that's normal. TRP wants to teach you that there's a ""correct"", distanced way of handling dating and relationships that makes you completely invulnerable, but that's just bullshit.

So, to answer your question: in my experience, situationally, sex usually grows out of prolonged and intense kissing and touching. Let your mouth and your hands wander and try to register whether your partner is comfortable with it or not. When it gets to the point where you start removing articles of clothing, there's usually (usually!) kind of a more or less silent consensus that sex might ensue. At that point it's also completely normal to ask whether you will have sex later. The thing RPers ignore is that enthusiastic, explicit consent is part of what makes sex enjoyable. The idea of actually having sex makes you grin? Imagine having the idea *while actually having sex*, and having the idea that your partner, *actually having sex with you,* has the same idea. It's somewhat like what Emmanuel Lévinas calls ""jouissance"": the joy of being aware of enjoying something. But I digress.

If you want tips as to which *situations* lead to sex, there are two obvious things: 1) if you schedule spending the night together in one bed if (AND ONLY IF) you're already romantically involved. Sex in this situation is NOT obligatory, but attempts at initiating it will not be considered outlandish. But, remember: ONLY IF you are already physically intimate.
2) watch a movie alone together. This usually happens on a couch or in bed and is a type of date which so commonly leads to sex that ""watching DVDs"" in air quotes is kind of a code phrase for sex, at least where I come from. You won't make a fool out of yourself trying to embark upon a course of action that might (if both of you consent all the way) end up in sex with a person who has kissed you passionately a couple of times before and who has agreed to spend an evening alone with you in front of a TV. Again: IF AND ONLY IF there has been prior intimacy.

The main point is to think about it as a team activity. Intimacy is a kind of fun thing two (or more) people create together by working, ahem, hand in hand. It's not about tricking a person into being alone with you and then prodding them with a penis until they give in. It's about the partners explicitly or implicitly planning to make out, which may segue into foreplay and, eventually, sex. Or you just plain plan to fuck right away.","1383264643"

"funny","t5_2qh33","In Montreal, we have riots almost every time our hockey team wins a playoff series. It more or less happens in about three steps:

(1) We all go into the streets and drink. There are so many people drinking that the police let it slide. We're mostly there for a good time anyway. 

(2) A group of anarchists, who don't have much support, black bloc the party. They mainly go for police cars, but they also break store windows.

(3) Some of the drunks join in and steal alcohol, and other's try to prevent the damage, which effectively amounts to fighting the anarchists. Most of the people celebrating, however, just mind their own business. 

(4) The riot police, who had been calmly waiting for the party to quiet down or become violent, move in. There are fewer people in the streets and they march in formation, clearing the remaining people out effectively. 

In 2010, when we won two series that we had no business winning, I was at both parties/riots. In one of them, my bag of beer got caught behind the riot police line. I asked one of them for it and he reached back with his foot and kicked it forward to me. They really don't care about the drunks. They are there to clear out the streets and arrest anarchists who cause real problems. ","1383264647"

I have been in situation B before, and just managed to catch a display before it fell on a little stinkbeast who was stuffing around. I told it to be careful... the mother thanked me, as she was wrestling with a stroller/pram at the time.

Moral of the story: Speak up. If the parent has a go at you, tell them to watch their fucking spawn so that strangers dont have to parent for them. If the parent is decent, they will be happy that strangers are kind enough to want their spawn to be safe and may not have realised their little beast's behaviour was annoying other people (cause parents tend to develop alot of patience, lol).","1383264650"

It was the middle of the night, I couldn't sleep.  My room was almost completely dark, but I can just make out a completely black figure come through my bedroom door.  It walked up to the bed and leaned in until its face was about 2 inches from my face.  I can't see anything other than the black outline.  It then turns, walks over to my closet, and disappeared into the blackness of my closet.  

I was too scared to move or even breath really.  

About 2-3 minutes later, it comes back from the closet (not a walk-in, just a simple closet) and again put its face right up to mine.

I thought about lifting my head, head-butting it gently (just anything to let it know I was a living being and it was in my face), but I couldn't move.  I finally let out a peep/grunt and it took off out the bedroom door.  It didn't walk out, it seemed to melt down in stature and then there was a shape that went out the door (maybe on all fours, but it did this silently).

I never found out what it was.  I assume I imagined the whole thing, but it seemed so real.

"weightroom","t5_2ssmu","I'll vouch for them as well, especially for a powerlifter.
 
Think about it: Where does a powerlifter rely on their lats the most? In the contracted position. When a lifter is bench pressing, they use their lats at the bottom of the press. By the time they're at lockout, lat involvement is minimal. 

Same thing for the deadlift. The arms are down and the shoulders depressed in the deadlift, shortening the lats. So the lats get the most work in the contracted position.

This is all about figuring out carryover. Why do we do pull ups and rows? To strengthen the deadlift and bench. From there, we figure out how do we modify pull ups and rows to get the most carry over to the moves that matter. In this case, strengthening the top end part of the row is strengthening the part of the movement that matters the most.","1383264652"

There are players like Rondo who don't want to play because he doesn't see a point in doing it. I don't know if you've kept up with Bradon Jennings but he isn't doing that great in the NBA and has been making a name for himself as a selfish player who is an inefficient scorer. What I mean is that the Euroleague is turning into a development league for NBA is that NBA teams are starting to draft more and more European or other foreign players and a lot of these players don't go through colleges like U.S players but go to European teams where they develop before going to the NBA.

It ended up being 1.4 trillion because of the stimulus package. The stimulus package was designed to be spent spread out over multiple years. Only 180 billion of it was spent in the first years which explains the the difference between the CBO projection and the actual number. So the deficit was already set to be that high because of the previous adminstration and Republican policy, not because of the stimulus package. Even logically, if the whole 700bil was spent in 2008-2009 and that was the reason the deficit jumped from 700bil to 1.4tril, then how would you explain the high deficit for all the years after? Do you think we've been passing a 700bil dollar stimulus every year? You clearly didn't bother to think this one through.
http://useconomy.about.com/od/candidatesandtheeconomy/a/Obama_Stimulus.htm


Spending is only up as a dollar amount and that's only on a federal government level. Overall spending by the govt (including states) is down. Also, as a percentage of GDP, govt spending is down which means the govt has become more efficient with its spending. If Obama was really increasing spending, then we'd see spending rising to the equivalent that the GDP is rising, and it's not.

Actually, using a [release](http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images?_adv_prop=image&amp;fr=moz35&amp;va=arrow+release) is probably more common than anything else. due to bowhunting. I mean, in the rural United States where I live there are plenty of people who shoot, but I'm the only person I know who uses a recurve bow and my fingers. If You go to any of the many shops in the area you have to wade through dozens of compound bows to even find a recurve and they carry a dozen or more types of releases and hardly anything for finger shooting, just the occasional fingertab or fingertip glove.  

&gt;Theres videos of people hitting thrown targets while riding.    
    
Lars Anderson has a video of him shooting moving targets and hitting things on while on the move and while falling, he speaks about that during the setup, how ancient archers could shoot on the fly from horseback or while falling or jumping and still hit with decent accuracy.     
**EDIT** Oh, and hitting a lone target or two from a horse wasn't what I meant about battlefield usefullness, I meant that you could fire a volley of arrows from behind your front line far faster loading and drawing that way, just as he has shown in the ""11 shots before the first one hits"" video. You can't shoot that fast with a mediteranean draw, it just doesn't allow for that kind of reloading speed which means you can't volley as many arrows from the same number of archers into the enemy's lines as you can with the method Anderson is using.","1383264661"

Even if you got her back, things will never be the same as you thought they were.  Whether she wants to be with somebody else, or just doesn't want to be with you, something about you just isn't perfect for her.  You should consider that getting her back would be getting somebody who has both hurt you and declared that what you have shared wasn't enough.  It always hurts when a relationship ends, but please try to consider it as less time you will waste not being with the right person.  You WILL find somebody who loves you as you are, and who doesn't want to consider a life without you.  This is what you want.  You want to be with somebody who, on top of possessing qualities you desire, also wants to be with only you (unless THAT is not your thing).  

Just remember that the right person is out there.  Being single sucks.. or at least BECOMING single sucks, being with the wrong person is far worse.

The new feature is pets. There are three critters that will fight monsters alongside you (except for the chicken who just panics). For now, they can be recruited at the beginning of each dungeon.

It should work with existing saves but the pets will only appear in dungeons you haven't been to yet.

I'll take any feedback you have at all. [Here are the bugs I already know about](http://wiki.bytten.net/Lenna/Known%20Issues).

Gamepads are supported (including PS3 and Xbox controllers now). There are no defaults though so you'll need to configure your gamepad in the options menu first.

**What is this shit?**

Lenna's Inception is a Zelda-esque top-down action-RPG game with procedurally-generated maps and puzzles.

**More info: [@tccoxon](http://twitter.com/tccoxon), [devlog](http://bytten.net/), [IndieDB](http://www.indiedb.com/games/lennas-inception)**

"AskMen","t5_2s30g","Most of us who aren't asexual consider sex and sexual attraction an important part of a relationship. Yes, for a relationship a guy wants a girl he shares a personal connection with, and yes, he wants a girl he enjoys spending time with. But he also wants a girl who inspires sexual passion in him, and whether anyone likes it or not, a significant part of a woman's sexual attractiveness comes from her physical beauty. It's not right or wrong, but it's the way it is. We can't change it any more than women can change the fact that a large part of a man's sexual attractiveness to them is his confidence and success/status.

I might have everything in common with a particular woman and we might work great together, but if I don't feel any sexual attraction to her then she'll be a great candidate for a friend, but not a girlfriend.

Women aren't particularly different in this regard. There are plenty of guys who will complain about a woman only being interested in friendship and not in a relationship with them, and the cause is the exact same. These men simply failed to inspire sexual passion in the women. The only difference is that men's and women's sexual attraction doesn't necessarily work the same way, so we might have a woman who fails to inspire sexual attraction because she's overweight and a man who fails to inspire sexual attraction because he's a pushover and uncharismatic.","1383264680"

They scored each person for certain hallmarks of age and the smoking twin had higher scores 57% of the time. The faces were scored separately. 

(Even if they had just asked a dichotomous question it would make more sense to say ""which face looks older"" rather than ""do they look the same or does *this* one look older"".

Common use magazines would be at the very least the standard capacity magazines issued with a new firearm.  For many pistols and rifles that's already above 10 rounds.

You seem to have interpreted the constitution backwards.  It's not a document to grant permission to use certain things.  It's to prevent legislation limiting things.  It's not, here is a list of all the firearms you are allowed to have.  It's saying, laws limiting the bearing of arms can not stand and are prohibited.

I didn't feel like I was losing IO on my 4x 1TB disks.

I haven't had a chance to play with tiering (I've been excited about it since it was announced). I ended going with freeNAS for my storage. I tried using my SSD in a few different configurations but ultimately couldn't see a difference with my workload. I ended up being happier using it as a stand alone disk.

tips/info:

decide if you want to test out resfs - i'm not sure what changed in R2, if anything.

http://community.spiceworks.com/topic/332821-is-resfs-ready-for-production

test, test, test. See what kind of IO you get with different configurations. Does it do what you need? You have tons of disk space, don't get yourself into a position where you have to stick with a config because you moved your storage into 'production' during the process of seeing what works.

A 'cool' thing I've seen with server 2012 and smb 3.0 is serving VMs from an SMB 3.0 share to Hyper-v on Server 2012. Could be a fun test if you don't want to deal with iscsi.

Thanks for the reminder about R2 and tiered storage. I'm going to start playing around with it.

"Pathfinder_RPG","t5_2trms","1 - Quite balanced.  They do one thing (damage), and they do it pretty darn well.  The touch AC issue only applies on the first range increment with early firearms (first 5 on advanced, more on this in 2), so while powerful, can be shut down (flying enemies with ranged attacks).  If you let him do some crazy TWF'ing Pistolero shenanigans it will get overpowered though (more on this in 3).

2 - The class and the base rules are not made for advanced firearms.  A revolver is a powerful weapon that should not be available for a first level character.    I would recommend not allowing any advanced firearms until you have at least spent more time looking into them, and maybe not even then.  Since they target touch AC for 5 range increments, a revolver will basically have little issue hitting any target within 100 feet.  Compare that to a pistol's 20 feet.

3 - Make sure he pays his feat tax and crafting tax to get free action reloads (rapid reload feat (only applies to one single weapon type) and alchemical charges).  Make sure to enforce misfires.  Watch the ammo crafting, a gunslinger can turn 100 gold in untracked raw materials into 1000 gold worth of gunpowder, and this can completely ruin a game if you allow him to sell this.
The Pistolero archetype can, by RAW, get Dex to damage twice.  This is pretty obviously a mistake, and should not be allowed.  Do not let him take the trench fighter archetype and stack yet another dex modifier to damage.
Two weapon fighting as a gunslinger has recently been nerfed.  Weapon cords now require a move action to retrieve a dropped weapon, so take note.  Now you either need to quickdraw loaded pistols, or have extra limbs (alchemist/white haired witch dip, some races have prehensile tails).

If you allow him to play the class and he is too powerful, throw some monks at him.  Monks have high touch AC (usually equal to normal AC), so they will be harder for him to hit.  Also there is a spell bullet shield and an amulet of bullet protection to help keep him from killing key enemies too quickly.","1383264695"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was stopped at a small gas station, a bit off the highway. It was about midnight, I really needed gas, and this was the first place I could find. After filling up with gas, I look inside and see a light coming out from the back, and when I pull the door sure enough it opens. Continuing in, I notice that there isn't anyone here, but a light is still flickering in the back, coming from a door left partially open. I decide to look around for a bit. I scan through the shelves, all stocked, quite sparsely, with old candies, chips and  other snacks. All of it was long since expired, probably from the early 90's. I was pretty skeptical about the gas station at this point, but I just couldn't get myself to leave without seeing what was behind that door left partially open. So I muster up my courage and start walking towards it when the light finally dies out. I was freaked out now, but I still couldn't leave. I stumble around, using the wall to guide me to the door. When I get there, I realize the light didn't go out, the door closed. I slowly came to understand this meant I probably wasn't alone. At this point, only sheer stupidity and curiosity kept me from heading back out to my car, which I didn't. I pushed the door; nothing happened. As I fumbled around to see if there was a doorknob, a moaning grunting noise came from behind the door. Instead of running back to my car, like a fool I found the doorknob, twisted, and barged into the next room. I clenched my eyes shut, expecting a murder or perhaps some form of zombie.

Now, looking back, I wish it would have been a murderer, or a corpse, or two men eating each other while they were also bathing in human blood and tears. But sadly no. My eyes were met with a much more gruesome image. Sitting on the white (no longer) tile floor was a giant, monstrous, rancid pile of human feces. It had literal stink lines coming form it, the kind you see in the cartoons. Looking past that, I saw an old man, probably high of some form of laxatives if that is even possible, nearly passed out from the exertion of the shit. Scariest shit I've ever seen.","1383264699"

"europe","t5_2qh4j","Most of the differences between countries is because how ESA funding works. ESA has *mandatory* and *optional* programmes and countries participate to those they deem useful.

All member countries contribute to the mandatory programmes on a scale based on their GDP. The optional programmes are of interest to some members who are free to decide on their level of involvement.

For example Finland (and many other members) does not participate into the optional human spaceflight program. Therefore we won't see a Finnish astronaut orbiting Earth on the ISS, but then again I don't think it would be worth the expence and the money can be put on other science. I for one would opposed of wasting science funding on people buzzing about in the orbit.

The **mandatory** programmes are: Future studies, technological research, education, common investments (facilities, laboratories, infrastructure), Solar System science, astronomy and fundamental physics.

The **optional** programmes are: Human Spaceflight, telecommunications &amp; integrated 
applications, Earth observation, launchers, navigation, robotic exploration and space situational awareness

It's not that we don't care, it's just that we don't understand, and the fact is, until you yourself ARE crazy, you'll NEVER understand it, and so you'll always think of people with serious mental health issues as ""different"" and possibly ""dangerous"" and you'll likely exclude and ostracize them, even if unintentionally.  But pouring money into a system that already works relatively fine isn't going to change THAT at all.

In the case of most people with mental health issues being involved in crime, it is almost NEVER an issue of lack of available services or lack of funding for those services.  It is almost ALWAYS a result of the individual either not seeking that help in the first place, or seeking it, getting medication, and then deciding not to take that medication for whatever reason.  As you can see, these are not things you, nor I, nor any government agency or organization can ""fix"", shy of draconian measures in regards to the mental health act.","1383264702"

Comcast has to run their cords on this power lines, so they must pay their competitor in order to give people cable. The power company could simply cut Comcast's cords, strangling Comcast, but they're doing the smart thing and forcing Comcast to pay rent as it were for taking up space on the lines.

White's starting advantage may not be enough to win, but it means that in GM games a small mistake with white will often mean the game becomes equal, while a small mistake with black may push you into positions which are very difficult to play or even objectively losing. ","1383264705"

The advantage of hedge funds is they try to make money *whether the market, in general, rises or falls*.  The disadvantage is that if they mess up or get unlucky, the losses can be huge, up to and (in some cases) including losing *all* of the investors' money.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","&gt;I usually see you as a complete douche-bag

Well I am pretty much a douche bag.

&gt;I am actually going with a similar route by flipping houses. I've made enough money in profit to buy 2 tiny 1400sq-ft starter homes that I remodeled/renovated, all new grass, and even acid-cleaned the driveway and sidewalk around in front of the houses. Carrying costs on the houses are maybe $1500/yr in property tax and $250/mo to a property mgmt company to take care of the properties. Rent is $650/mo, and they're appraised at $65k each (bought for $35k each with $15k in renovations to one, and $5k in another). If they're value goes anywhere closer to $100k, I'll sell them and start looking to buy more properties similar to the two I already have and have many small, nice houses for rent.

Peanuts. Do you own your home? You know you have that equity there just sitting around doing nothing. The last property I bought, well the 3rd to last property I bought technically was a multiplex. I got it for 110k after the guy got foreclosed on, the place was already rented out and the smallest units rent was 1200 dollars a month. One of the tenants got a break on rent to manage the place and collect the rent for the previous owner, I kept him on board. I went to the closing and signed the papers and thats it. This guy goes to the bank every month and deposits 7400 dollars into the properties specified account, which the mortgage is taken out of every month (2400$) and I will own it out right in 5 years. This place is paying me 5 grand a month to own it. Beautiful. Just thinking about that purchase makes me get a hard on, if I had ten places like this one I'd go ahead and sell all of my other businesses and just retire. heh, probably not I get bored easy, but my point is that there is just piles of money out there waiting to made.

&gt;It feels good to have about $1000 be deposited into my savings account on a monthly basis already, and the only work I do is maybe make a phone call to my property management company I hired to make sure things are fine.

Well it does feel nice, 1000 dollars.. I think you're playing it safe too often. Also I'd get on that management companies ass, you calling them? Calling them on your own time? I think thats bullshit, you're paying them, they need to call you and they need to give you a detailed report. Probably nothing much happens too often but 250 dollars a month? You're goddamn right you better be getting your moneys worth.

&gt;My goal is to at least bring in $5k/mo in personal income from investment/income properties in the next 5 years and have my own small property mgmt company.

Plan small its how you get big. I wanted to own a home and a nice car in 20 years when I started. I achieved that in 2. Then I wanted a couple homes, a few nice cars, motorcycle and boat. I got there and I was still in my twenties. My point is play it small but in the back of your mind have an end game, a bigger picture and don't ever be satisfied. Real estate can make you money but keep in mind there are better ways out there, for me real estate is a hobby and the game is money. ","1383264707"

What he is doing is pretty awful, but he has tricked himself into thinking it isn't a big deal.  With men, their ego says- ""I should be fucking 50 bitches per day, every woman should be birthing my babies, the world should be privileged that my cock exists""  
  
So he is basically fucking, or thinking about fucking hookers in order to assure himself that even though he is tied down to a gf, he is still genghis khan, and can fuck any woman he wants.  Even if he has to pay for it....  
  
So basically what I am trying to tell you is that this guy is not ready for commitment, and hasn't reached the stage, (or never will) where he wants to be monogamous.  Don't feel bad, it's not that you're not good enough, it's just that you can't morph into 50 different women every day and have his babies at the rate of 18250 per year as he desires.  
  
He is putting you at risk by sleeping with escorts, and that alone is a bad thing.  Very bad.  You just need to wish him well and leave.  I'm sorry to tell you that if you do not leave, this will keep happening, and he will probably just hold it against you that you even got in his business.  
  
This is my hunch.  He could just be a scumbag, but most likely he is the typical man who is not ready for commitment, and still wants to believe that he is the ghengis khan of the 21st century.

If you need something more than a single primitive then I normally create a data (aka a model) class to hold the data. You can then carry that instance around and pass it to other classes either in their constructors, their properties or their method parameters. 

As others have said you can also have a shared base class though honestly I try to avoid that as there are maintance and type issues with inhertiance which I try to avoid though sometimes an abstract base is really what you want.

Now it sounds to me like you may be trying to avoid having to write a control class to orchstrate this and feel it should be cleaner. You are right that it can be though you will need to look into what is called Dependency Injection or Inversion of Control frameworks to do away with the class that relates everything.

Biggie for not being in MH was the lack of a tube. It's middle class but gone slightly downhill as quite a few shops have gone bust which is then followed by turning them into charity shops.

Lots of chain shops. What I liked about East Finchley was things like an independent grocer. MH does have an independent fish monger (they are as miserable as fuck in there but it is not a chain!).

Miso soup with wakame and tofu cubes is very nice though, you should try that. If you make it youself, be sure to begin with dashi or bonito stock. Miso ramen is a little different, basically a more robust flavour than miso soup because of other ingredients such as soy sauce, mirin and meat stock.","1383264720"

However now, when I see a craftbrewer with nothing but over hopped beer on their menu I feel like the circle is complete, and the counter reactionary move will begin to pick up steam. I predict old world styles(non-belgian as thats already played out) with an American twist will be en vogue in the years to come, a reaction to the over use of hops for the past decade, and the maturing of the craft brew industry. The hoppy beers, will still have their place, but they hopefully won't dominate menus as much  they dominate palates in the coming years. ","1383264723"

HOWEVER, I would also be wary about what the venue's are that they play in.  Down the stretch with it getting colder there will be outdoor games with shitty weather.  I tend to like dome matchup's later in the year so someone like Brees is attractive because all of his home games have no adverse weather conditions.","1383264737"

Gun purchasing advice... Any quality firearm will outlive you if you properly care for it, so don't fret *too* much over choosing your first. There will be a second and a third and so on... The most important considerations are purpose, price, and fit (in my opinion, anyway). If you just want a range toy, you'll probably want a full size or compact pistol with an alloy or steel frame. If you like the Glock 19, that's not a bad choice, but get your hands on some other pistols to see how they feel. I too did my research and decided that I wanted a Glock, but I fell in love with CZ the first time I held one. Also, if you've never shot a pistol with a single action or DA/SA trigger before, I *highly* recommend trying one before buying a Glock.

You seem well informed about the most popular options, but those are simply the most popular; they are not for *everyone*!

Also, best to avoid IDing yourself so outright. There are gun-hating nutters out there.","1383264739"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I forgave him, and once I got ""comfortable"" again, he just went out and did it again. And again. Once he got away with it, he assumed that by being sneakier (which ended up with him becoming more defensive) I would never find out again.

Eventually he ended up beating me up a couple of times because I told him I was done with his shit and wanted out, and he ""loved me so much"" that he just *couldn't* lose me, so obviously the best way to show that was by playing caveman.

It got to the point where I broke up with him over the phone and hid out at random friend's houses for a week or so and just left all of his shit on my front porch for him to pick up.

About 6 months after that I was out front washing my car and he drove by my house and waved at me (I lived on a really quiet residential street that would've been out of the way for him regardless of where he was going or who he was seeing.) and then denied it when a mutual friend had asked him about it, then said I was a fucking psycho. Then he went ahead and tried to do anything in his power to destroy my reputation and relationships with mutual friends. I lost a lot of friends because of it.

It took me a long time to get over all of the damage that relationship caused. And I still have a really hard time wholly trusting people, partially because of him cheating, and partially because of the people who were willing to believe his ridiculous stories and drop my friendship so easily, even if they had known me most of our lives.

The bright side is, the few 'friends' of mine that I had lost to him ended up being pretty shitty in the longrun anyway, and I gained most of *his* friends whom he ended up losing in the process, and they are some of the most incredible people that I am grateful and proud to call friends.","1383264740"

&gt;When an item is coinshared, the item goes straight to the Grand Exchange and will stay in at market price until it is bought by another player. However, when the actual trading price is far below the Grand Exchange market price, all coinshared items will continue to enter the game and stand at market price. This leads to a large number of items stuck at market price, forming what is known as a ""Coinshare Wall"". Because of the large volume of items being coinshared, it means you will be able to buy that item at market price until all the coinshare items are bought up. When the Grand Exchange updates, the market price may go down and all the items held in this ""Coinshare Wall"" will be moved down with it. **This leads to the creation of GP as the item would've been coinshared at a higher price, but it still hasn't been bought at a lower price.**","1383264742"

It won't make the game hard at all - it will just be tedious. Also, PvP NEEDS to be a focus, as much as PvE, simply because the community grows on quality PvP (not deathmatching on Overwatch). Interest in games is MASSIVE when it's streamed/youtubed - i'm not a fanboy so inb4 those comments. Plus the community is buzzing more when it's popular - i'd rather see more loot and 10,000's more players than barely anything and a lot less. 

It NEEDS to have a balance. The more sales it makes in alpha, the more B.I will invest time and resources into producing updates. It's a no brainer. I personally have never played on Overwatch/Spawn with a gun servers, ever - but I appreciate players do NOT have 6-8 hours free time to spend ''curing AIDS'' on the standalone or just looting basic food/drink(as an example). Sadly, it needs to appeal to your average gamer too - and just looking at the server numbers and streaming/videos sums it all up. Aftermath (which I play on - low military loot and barely any meds, about 5-10 players per server) compared to Overwatch (so many packed 24/7).","1383264742"

&gt; If they are centralized then it is a trivial exercise to buy the copyrights, fork the project, change the license unilaterally, and move off in a closed direction.

If that is the case, then the collective fifty states'  Attorney General's offices, individually or in parts, need to wake up and examine this practice.  Selling property that takes on a charitable nature back to someone who will make a profit from it raises some serious questions about self-dealing and whether the public interest is being served.  

It is the role of the AG's office to protect the public interest.  

This, unfortunately, is probably such an esoteric area of the law, the Attorney General offices of the collective fifty states will never consider it -- they have enough problems just monitoring the wild an wooly world of their charities.  But, of course, someone could step in under the private attorney general doctrine if there was support to prevent the project from going private. ","1383264744"

It's not like I'm investing 15k in my neighbor's start up.  

This reduced rate is predominantly helping those in the market...and I'm not sure considering that we are facing the decline of the middle class, and therefore the decline of our economic society a reduced tax rate for gains of this nature are warranted.

Good for Obama for raising the cap gains rate and qual dividends rate for those over certain income threshholds.

Step 2 should be to go higher with those rates and approach ordinary income rates and also to increase the minimum wage.

In fact, with MO  not actually modifying the Skyrim data folder,  if you had an endgame character, you could back  up saves, drop in a pack, play through the new mods and then revert. Maybe all of step could be this way... A single download. ","1383264753"

I think people are just trying to say that if you're looking for something that really shows the experimental/progressive side of music, don't have your standards be at the mainstream. Truly experimental music doesn't generally have mainstream appeal, barring a few exceptions I'm sure. Instead, ""open people's minds"" to the music that exists outside of what everyone has already been exposed to; ""open people's minds"" to the universe of music that never made it to the mainstream because it is niche enough to not ever make it to the mainstream.","1383264755"

That is essentially what it's like to sit in a college literature class with the exception of a professor. And in a pool of thousands of people in a forum you're going to find people with great insight and experience, and you can learn from them, *for free*. The internet is simply more accessible, affordable and time-friendly than the traditional college method.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","A x B km means an apoapsis (highest point on the orbit) of A km and periapsis (lowest point on the orbit) of B km. This is often written with orbital altitude, though sometimes it's orbital radius. Often, you'll have to understand the context to determine which it is (in this case, it's altitude above the mean radius of the Moon).

Retrograde orbits move in a direction opposite the rotation of the planet they're orbiting. So a retrograde orbit of Earth would go from east to west, while a posigrade orbit would go from west to east.

C degrees is a measure of the inclination of the orbit. The inclination is the angle between the plane of the orbit and the equator of the planet. So an orbit with an inclination of 0 degrees would be one that goes along the equator, an orbit of inclination 51.6 degrees would be inclined to the equator at 51.6 degrees (and would reach a maximum latitude of 51.6 degrees North and South), an orbit of 90 degrees would go over the poles, perpendicular to the equator. Inclinations of greater than 90 degrees imply a retrograde orbit. LADEE's orbit is therefore inclined ~~46~~ 44 degrees to the Moon's equator, going backwards.

Altitudes on other planets are subject to any number of interpretations. For instance, Mars's ""mean sea level"" is based on a reference atmospheric pressure. Other useful altitude references are reference ellipsoids (an oblong sphere that approximates the shape of the planet), the geoid (essentially a shape on the surface of which gravity is constant), and even a sphere. The 50x50 km orbit is almost certainly given with respect to the Moon's mean equatorial radius (essentially making the approximation of a spherical Moon, for the purpose of describing a Keplerian orbit).","1383264756"

He is a 70lb sweet heart and I wouldn't trade him for the world. 

Unless an animal actually shows aggression towards a child, they are perfectly fine. 

I do recommend tolerance training. Basically, pull his ears, tail, and fur in random places and see how he reacts. There is no way to stop a 14 month old from doing it, so all dogs should be trained to deal with it. 

Side note. My mother in law was the majority holder in the ""don't let the dog near the baby"" stock. I showed her she was wrong as hell when he was afraid (even got the puppy hiccups) of my newborn for the first week of her life. He has never hurt her. ","1383264757"

It's fine for a cat, or as you said, a goldfish, but for a dog? No.

We both work full time: we somewhat stagger our hours so that the dogs are not alone as long, and we have a dog walker who comes every day at lunch. The longest our dogs are without humans  is four hours…and they have each other. They adore each other. That's how a situation where ""we have to work"" works out ok. 

But I can't see living by myself, with one dog, who is alone for 12 hours, and expecting it to work out ok.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","&gt; I'm a professional programmer

And I tend to find loads of absolutely obvious security bugs in code written by professional programmers. Often by those that claim to be security-aware. Very rarely from people who actually are, but even them do still fuck it up. Security isn't easy.

&gt; so I won't just speak in generalities like security analysts. 

You should thank me instead for trying to make my explanations as easy to understand as possible. 

&gt; This is precisely what I'm suggesting. Applications could verify that hash on install time or even every execution if they felt like it.

You've been saying that? You must have confused me somewhere down the line, as you're insisting on some silly idea that codecs can't possibly ever have security issues.

Fundamentally, a hash check is all I'm asking for. That and one or more professional audits of the source code and the blob, if it isn't made so that an identical binary can be built, which is a current academic interest, not something that's being done in practice as a matter of fact.

&gt; A codec is very simple. It's just a series of mathematical operations on a stream of provided data to an output stream of data. 

Conceptually simple, yes. In practice, it depends on the format and implementation (h264 is pretty convoluted to begin with). Implementations tend to be a soup of relatively hard to understand code and relatively easy to fuck up with assumptions about the source stream, often made in the name of performance. That's why there's historically been a load of security bugs in codec implementations. As a popular example, just look at how often image decoder implementation bugs have been the vector that allowed breaking game console security for homebrew and subsequently piracy.

&gt; A codec absolutely never has any business making those calls. Even in a binary, they are extraordinarily obvious.
&gt; [insert unwelcome long pointless description down to system calls on how to do incredibly basic things on a computer here, by person who said ""I won't just speak in generalities like security analysts"" and felt pressured to try and show off, backfiring]

And it would not, period. I already explained how a backdoor could be implemented as a security bug in a post above, not ever involving any syscall in the blob.

&gt; (blah blah blah w ^ x) meaning that there is no way to execute any data contained within the video file.

Oh please, this is 2013. Have you not heard of Return Oriented Programming? It bypasses the protection you described and many others (such as incomplete ASLR, which is the norm). Not to mention you're assuming all those protections are there to begin with, in each and every program that uses the codec, on every system these programs run on.

Which is an incredibly naive view.

&gt; That leaves us in the situation where the binary cannot have malicious code in it because it would be easily detected.

It definitely would be in the form of a deliberate security hole, which aren't that easy to detect. That's why we have security holes, exploits and companies that offer code audit services.

&gt; The entire reason why this is so straightforward in this codec example is because the codec cannot justify making any system calls which could lead to a problem.

As I said a million times, it would be a security bug, not a fucking obvious backdoor. See above.

tl;dr: If you don't understand security, stay out of discussions on security unless you want to embarrass yourself.","1383264760"

"battlefield_4","t5_2uie9","the thing is, i believe these crashes are truly a minority of cases, and of the actual crashes i don't think they are entirely BF4's fault.  i was running 2xGTX465s with few crashes, and yesterday i upgraded to a GTX770 and started crashing a whole lot more; that is probably *not* 100% BF4's issue.

we all know that gamers are vastly a whiny and dramatic bunch that tend to overblow problems and froth at the mouth over perceived slights.  (for example, look at the downvotes on this post that are probably because they *disagree* with me, which is **not what downvotes are for.**  downvotes are for *non-constructive* posts like the console-trolling douchbag below.  upvotes are for *constructive* posts, e.g. i have upvoted well-written posts like pyrofox's even if i don't agree with them.)  gamers will run to complain about problems faster than they'll *look for solutions to them*, and they'll almost never comment on a game that performs well (which i have done).

i feel you on losing XP, which does suck a lot.  but we actually only lose them when the server crashes, and i've had a battle report that i thought was lost simply show up after a delay.  i don't think it's as bad as it seems, especially since the game is 3 days old and XP boosts are easy to come by.

this *has* been a pretty good game launch - way better than any of the BF launches that i can remember (most were awful).  now, a track record of buggy releases doesn't excuse a *less* buggy release, but on its own i still feel this is above-par for a very complex and technically ambitious multiplayer game.","1383264768"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Anthony Davis. Remember Davis played  guard throughout high school, and was only 6'2''. Only after he had an 8 inch growth spurt did he transition to the front court. His ball handling skills are leaps ahead of Dwight's. By all accounts he's supposed to be a generational defensive talent, and his offensive game is more refined than Dwights. He can shoot it from outside the paint and his mid-range game could become a   dangerous weapon for him. Comparing their rookie years, Howard averaged 12 ppg, 10 reb, 0.9 assists, 0.9 steals, 1.7 blocks, while shooting 52% (33 mins). Davis averaged 13.5 ppg, 8.2 rebounds, 1.0 assists, 1.2 steals, 1.8 blocks while shooting 51.6% (29 mins). Playing 4 fewer minutes, he still averaged more points, and steals, assists, and blocks. On top of that, he's got one thing that no one in the league has, a fierce unibrow.

There are two holes at the backend of the rotation (maybe one if Detwiler is healthy). There are two extension candidates (Desmond, Zimmermann) and we'll be linked to just about every big-name free agent, although I doubt we sign one.

""Encounter in an official capacity"" might be a bit closer. The legal phrase used in the Ohio Revised Code is ""stopped for a law enforcement purpose"", which differs from the classical use of ""stopped"" which is equivalent to ""detained"".

Finally it grew close enough to recognize what it wasn't.  It was way too big to be a fish, too big even to be a plastic bag. It was tinged blue with patches of hair. It was something that had once been alive...

I couldn't stand to sedums out and hurriedly caught a wave into shore, heart racing with equal parts stoke and disgust. When I paddled back out it had moved in farther toward the shore. 

On my next ride in I could see it lying there, washed up on the sand: a large dead bloated dog. Probably American Bulldog.

Even for fun.  All hours of the day.  So any gloves only work for me in ""you wouldn't be typing anyway"" situations, which limits it to driving and sleeping.

I eventually found some leather driving gloves that are comfortable to wear, that don't look like big heavy winter gloves I'd feel weird wearing in the spring time.

For night time, something you might find useful that I tried for awhile is to get some general purpose white cotton gloves, which are easy to find and easy to replace if you wreck or lose them, but not very tight fitting...but then, get yourself some rubber or latex gloves.  Apply lotion to hands. Put on white cotton gloves.  Now put latex gloves over white cotton gloves.  Now you can actually use your fingers again.  I learned this trick from a dermatologist who provided me with some medicated cream for awhile.  Note that your skin can't really breathe in this situation and when you take them off your fingers will be all sweaty and water logged, so don't do it for tremendously long periods.  I used to do it while sleeping, to help the medicine work without rubbing off through regular usage of my hands.

My name is Dan Bernal and I own the property at 92-94 Linden St next to Salem State. Recent work on the power lines followed by the water and sewerage to the school blocked, invaded and polluted our property for nearly four months. I've called the city, and they deferred blame to the university. I contacted the university and they sent us a couple people I'd be happy to name who presented a fairly convincing mea culpa in person (literally ""mea culpa mea culpa"") about the degree to which our rights and property were barricaded and often invaded by these proceedings, but they've since failed to follow up on their promise to do something about it. I love Salem. I own a home here and moved my family here. I have, however, retained an attorney. Why didn't the city contact me and at least ASK if they could blockade my property for a third if a year? Feel free to contact me directly, my name is Dan Bernal and you can google me easily or contact the Salem State office of community outreach. They're well aware. ","1383264775"

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","In most places, while the homeowner is able to do the cleanup themselves, it is in cases of things like asbestos containing siding that does not produce dust like sanding of an asbestos ceiling. I pulled the permit to remove the asbestos-containing siding on my home, and had to take a 2-hour class to do it myself. That permit was not available for asbestos ceilings or wrapped pipes--those are considered friable; only for siding and flooring. I had to bag and tag in a particular way, and take it only to a particular waste center.

I still have asbestos-wrapped ductwork behind the walls in my home. I have encapsulated it in all places--at the faces of the outlets--where it is accessible with paint.

Asbestos is only a risk if your landlord did not do it right and pull the right permits. Your baby is not at risk currently, as the risk is with inhalation and a direct physical threat. However, you may want to have your home tested for airborne asbestos fibers.","1383264776"

I used progressively smaller bands, but I was really only focused on the pullup since that grip is the baseline for all sorts of moves like toes to bar or kipping anything. Now I'm curious - maybe after the WOD tonight I'll see if I can chinup!

Edit: Today was one of those frustrating ""blerg"" workout days where I just wasn't feeling strong. I PR'd on Thrusters anyway (80#), so yay for that. But chinup test will happen some other day when I'm feeling non-blerg!","1383264776"

1. I can't find an article that contains this Sheikh's full interview. I found the newspaper it's supposedly from but can't find this story on it, if anybody can that would be an interesting read.

2. It follows a narrative, whereby one culture is backwards in comparison to another.

3. The Mars One mission being discussed is a SUICIDE mission. It is being planned entirely on the premise of it being a one way trip.  ALL Abrahamic religions are against suicide.

4. Nothing in this article includes an actual fatwa.

5. No author is listed for this article, it's just listed as by: News Limited Network.

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","Interesting point...I don't know if warging is specifically a hereditary Stark trait, but definitely seems to have something to do with the old gods and the blood of the First Men (both of which the Starks have). We do know about non-Stark wargs and non-warg Starks, but hell, it's a cool idea so let's talk about it.

If it is hereditary, a plausible explanation is the general re-emergence of magic in the world (dragons, etc). This might fit under that umbrella, but one event that isn't talked about as much is finding the direwolf puppies--the first direwolf seen south of the Wall in many years, one pup for each Stark kid, foreshadowing the deaths of Ned and Robert--to me, this reeks of magic/supernatural forces.

My theory is that the kids' relationships with their wolves are what awakened their warging abilities. While some of the other magic seems to start with the birth of Dany's dragons (end of AGOT), the Stark kids start to have these powers while raising their wolves (earlier AGOT). To me, this supports the theory that there are two separate supernatural forces--ice and fire--and the Starks draw their warging abilities from the ice magic of the North and the old gods.

This might get a little out-there, but if we're going with this theory, I think someone knew about their potential and intentionally sent the wolves...maybe CotF, maybe Bloodraven, maybe the old gods...maybe even Benjen/Daario!","1383264788"

First, you play the hipster card, pulling a statistic out your ass to add more support to your originality which, right before, you claim you never said you had. 

While your guns may be well made, most steampunk fanatics prefer to make their own accessories, guns being one of the first things many modify to look steampunk.

Continuing with that point, the nerf maverick is one of the most overused toy guns modified because of its appearance. 

I'm not saying to not use the maverick, it's a great gun to modify. I'm just saying that exact accessory, brand, and model are several people's first thing to modify, justifying how easy it would be to do it themselves; which is what many believe is the spirit of steampunk.

"SkyDiving","t5_2rkgw","I speedfly rather than base jump, but I open up a lot of new sites anyway and the process is pretty similar I'd imagine so here's what I do:

1-Check out an area in google maps terrain view or google earth to identify lines that look potentially interesting. Obviously for BASE you're going to be looking for exit points with significant rock drop, I'm not quite so limited here.

2-Check the landing area using any available photography/street view/satellite imagery for hazards, to see if there's anything that's a deal-breaker before I go out there.

3-Plan a few possible lines based on the height map, bearing in mind that this data isn't always right.

4-Visit the site, walk the landing area, take note of the line I want to fly on the way up. Try to judge whether the lines I've chosen will work okay.

5-Choose a line and fly it, maintain decent separation.

6-Come back again and repeat it, going a little closer etc.","1383264789"

47,500 kbits/s = 163.078308 Gbits/h = 20.3847885 GBytes/h

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Brazil's Maternal Mortality rate is 56 per 1,000,000. And the only statistics I could find say that Maternal Death is about five times as likely when the mother is aged 10-14. Now, this girl is 9, and having twins, so let's be extremely charitable and say that the chance of death is 100 times as likely. That's still only 5.6% percent.

Unfortunately that's not how biology works. Your odds of surviving a pneumonia are not that bad, if you end up in a hospital, and similarly your odds of surviving a bad fever are not too bad. Combine the two however, and your odds of surviving *exponentially* decrease. As such, the risk of a young girl dying from pregnancy when she is 9 is much higher than the average of 10-15 year olds, and the fact she has twins yet again exponentially increases those risks. It's not the case of increasing risks by a hundred-fold, it's more like increasing the risks by 100,000.

Also, [data from the USA](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr53/nvsr53_07.pdf) demonstrate that the odds of child mortality from 10-14 year old mothers is 15.6 in 1000, 2 to 3 times higher than in mothers aged 20-24. 

So, when you factor in that Brazil is a poorer country, that the mother is 9, that she is having twins, and that the odds of her having pre- or post-natal care are low, you end up with two potential lives that aren't terribly likely to make it, and who will likely permanently damage the girl's reproductive system, if not outright kill her.

Those odds do not look favorable at all, but rather than give the girl an abortion to safely terminate a pregnancy, and to let her have no risks to her future child-bearing ability, you would rather risk everything for two babies that probably wouldn't have survived.

There might be an element of naive heroism that one ought to always strive 200% to save every life possible, but that kind of morality is quickly confronted with the brutal fact that reality doesn't care for our wants or moralities.","1383264794"

"MechanicAdvice","t5_2tkvu","If you are intending to purchase a replacement car from a dealer you can use it as a trade in.    Realistically they are not going to give you much for it, but on the purchase paperwork they can inflate the purchase price of your new car by a couple thousand dollars and give you that much for your trade on paper so that  you show a sizeable down payment.  As a result you can get into a new car with little or no actual cash down.   I have done this many times, it is common practice; I haven't put any cash down for a vehicle in years.
   Alternatively, you can donate it to a charity that you want to support; you may be able to then deduct the book value of the car as a charitable donation off of your taxes next year; check with your accountant on this.
    Making a gift of it to a poor family which currently does not have a car might be something to consider.    Obviously you do not want to fix it, but to someone who has no transportation and needs a car to get to work it could be a godsend.    many people can do their own car repairs, and would be thrilled to have something that at least runs to fix and drive.    Your church, local food bank, or social service agencies could possibly know someone who would appreciate such a gift.
   If you have any friends or relatives who have a 16 year old kid in the family they may be interested in buying it as a first car or a project to fix up; however you will want them to be fully aware of the repairs needed in order to avoid problems.
   Your local vocational-technical school would I am sure be thrilled if you were to choose to donate your car to them as a practice vehicle for their auto mechanic students.    As an advisor to 2 auto mechanic training programs at tech schools, i can tell you that budgets are tight and it is difficult for many of them to find new practice vehicles for their students. this also may be tax deductible.
   Advertising it for sale in the local paper may get you a better response if you decide to sell it.    Also, some used car dealers purchase cars outright no matter what the condition as long as they can buy it cheaply enough to be able to take it to a dealer wholesale auction and make a small profit on it.","1383264796"

So I swan in, 23 and needing to pay rent. Hires me a few days later. £6.70 an hour. Meh. Love it at first, loved the responsibility etc etc. 

A little while later the workplace politics started. It was so awkward because half the staff hated the other half (and as I don't give a shit, I tried my best to get along with everyone) this was difficult. He was nowhere to be seen. 

Next thing, a member of staff keeps playing up. Tips stealing, slacking, sick days. As manager of the floor it was my duty to speak to her. So I do. Adult, calm, neutral environment with written evidence that she's being a cunt. Go through the whole thing (no supporting paper work because there was none. This is a shitty business) 
Bam. Calls the boss and reports that I'm harassing her. He doesn't give a shit anyway even if her claims were true. I ask him to defuse the situation and speak to her because I can't. Nothing. So by this point I'm super busy in one of the hottest and busiest summers ever (we took in 13k one week for dry cleaning. Busy busy) and super frustrated at the situation too. 

That summer we had 2 entire film productions, a Stage show, the world fire an police games and also a mass of industrial work, plus street customers and customer complaints, the 9-5 running of the shop and awkward staff to deal with. 


So he offers me a raise this one day. Six weeks later, nothing. So one day he comes in and starts mouthing off about something trivial I haven't completed. I haven't seen him in weeks for a start. 

I flipped. Told him everything that was bothering me, everything I've had to put up with including his wife being verbally abusive to staff when he wasn't there. He said it's all my fault and I'm not working hard enough. 


I left. He sent me an abusive text calling me a bitch and commenting on how my parents raised me. I never went back. My friend and ex co worker fills me in on how shit his new staff are, how's he's there all the time now correcting mistakes and checking earnings and how he regrets not raising my pay when he said he would.

Fucking dick.

The way the developers want you to go is like this: 

From Goodsprings (on the west side of the map), go down to Primm. Do the quest there to find more information about the guy who shot you from the deputy. Go south until you hit the junction. You have the option of going directly east to Nipton, or going southwest to the Mojave Outpost, where you can pick up a few quests, ammo, guns and repair your items. Either way, you head through Nipton. 

After that, you have to follow the road up to Novac. You can recruit a companion named Boone here. He's good. You can talk to some people around Novac about the man who shot you. If you speak to Manny Vargas and do his quest (or get access to his terminal) it'll point you to Boulder City, where there's a run-in with some Great Khans. You'll want to go there and talk to them, as they offer some information on the man who shot you. 

From there, it's practically a straight shot to New Vegas. You can stick to the roads to avoid trouble. You might want to check out the 188 Trading Post, though. There's a companion there named Veronica. She's good too. Likes leggy blondes and punching things. You could check out Camp McCarran, too, which is the main NCR base in the Mojave Wasteland. In any case, you'll be heading through Freeside to get to The Strip. You'll need 2000 caps to get through the guards at the gate, though. They don't take the money from you, they just check to see if you have it to keep the riff-raff out. From there? Do what you want. You've reached the main hub of the game. 

Good luck. Hope this helped. ","1383264804"

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Hi, there's really no time nor point to debate you here. Perhaps there is another subreddit for it. 

I will say about the dead cat though: people think that life just arose from some primeval soup. Right. No way. Look at a cat. It has all of its organs, its cells, mitochondria, blood, everything. You don't have to make anything. It even has all of the cat DNA. Just bring it to life. Why can't we do that? It should be easy I think that this would be a lot easier (or perhaps of equal complexity) to bringing life into being from nothing.  It turns out that life is an incredibly complex chain of chemical reactions where one product is the next process's reactant. These reactions continue without stopping, yet at a slow enough rate, controlled by enzymes, that we don't combust or burn up all of our glucose/ATP in 10 minutes and then expire. 

People just wave their hands and .. life appears, then the phyla magically appears, and then, based on random effects, people evolve. Yet, strangely, those people who believe that their brain and mind arose with no plan and no design, but just by random mutations, these people believe that their minds are reasonable and dependable. What if there was a mutation when you were a sea cucumber that made your brain think it was reasonable even though it isn't.  How can you trust your mind when you believe that your mind was formed by accident and chance?

There is so much that is glossed over in order for evolution to ""work"" and be accepted. You can dig into it if you want to and find holes. I can't make you investigate this nor believe that there are holes. So -- do as you wish. ;)","1383264807"

In this sense, the O.R. is an output device. Remember that because the O.R. has *two* screens, twice as much rendering is involved. This means that you will be getting a lower framerate than you are used to on your current settings. Because of this, I recommend that you ensure your computer's video card is powerful enough to render two images. (I might add that the images in the Developer's kit are 720P, not 1080P, like the consumer version will be. 720P rez will make rendering slightly easier on your computer.)

In terms of output, the O.R. sends back data from gyroscopes, accelerometers, or other 3D movement detection devices.

The O.R. comes with a box that plugs into your computer, although I am not entirely sure what it's purpose it.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;  rather than acting like the IDF randomly decided to occupy Syrian land one day because they were bored.

Read this [Moshe Dayan interview about circumstances of attack on Syria in 1967](http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/11/world/general-s-words-shed-a-new-light-on-the-golan.html).  Basically Dayan says that the Israelis provoked Syria into firing by advancing into a DMZ so they'd have an excuse to seize territory.  The 1967 war partly a war of fear against the Egyptian buildup, but Israel exploited the situation for territorial expansion.  From the Dayan interview:

&gt; ''Look, it's possible to talk in terms of 'the Syrians are bastards, you have to get them, and this is the right time,' and other such talk, but that is not policy,'' General Dayan told Mr. Tal in 1976. ''You don't strike at the enemy because he is a bastard, but because he threatens you. And the Syrians, on the fourth day of the war, were not a threat to us.''

&gt; According to the published notes, Mr. Tal began to remonstrate, ''But they were sitting on the Golan Heights, and . . . ''

&gt; General Dayan interrupted: ''Never mind that. After all, I know how at least 80 percent of the clashes there started. In my opinion, more than 80 percent, but let's talk about 80 percent. It went this way: We would send a tractor to plow some area where it wasn't possible to do anything, in the demilitarized area, and knew in advance that the Syrians would start to shoot. If they didn't shoot, we would tell the tractor to advance farther, until in the end the Syrians would get annoyed and shoot. And then we would use artillery and later the air force also, and that's how it was.''

&gt; …….

&gt; Mr. Tal asked, ''So all the kibbutzim wanted was land?''

&gt; And General Dayan answered: ''I'm not saying that. Of course they wanted the Syrians to get out of their face. They suffered a lot because of the Syrians. Look, as I said before, they were sitting in the kibbutzim and they worked the land and had kids and lived there and wanted to live there. The Syrians across from them were soldiers who fired at them, and of course they didn't like it.

&gt; ''But I can tell you with absolute confidence, the delegation that came to persuade Eshkol to take the heights was not thinking of these things. They were thinking about the heights' land. Listen, I'm a farmer, too. After all, I'm from Nahalal, not from Tel Aviv, and I know about it. I saw them, and I spoke to them. They didn't even try to hide their greed for that land.''","1383264808"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","Table sugar is sucrose, which is glucose + fructose minus a water molecule.  Brewers yeast can only directly metabolize monosaccharides, but is able to enzymatically convert disaccharides such as sucrose (w/ invertase) and maltose (w/ maltase) into their constituent parts.

Trick is that mashed malt (and extract made from mashed malt) contain mostly maltose but also a reasonable proportion of higher length sugars (maltodextrins and etc.) which yeast can't eat.  These higher order sugars are what's primarily responsible for the elusive ""mouthfeel"" or ""thickness"" in beer.

As for ""don't use bread yeast"", bread yeast has been selected over who knows how many thousands of years to do what bakers want it to.  This is mostly CO2 production, with any flavour biproducts being complimentary to bread.  Zymurgists of any sort have completely different goals to bakers, and wine/ale/lager/whatever yeast strains have evolved along _those_ lines.

Given that a dry beer or wine yeast shouldn't cost more than $5 for enough to do a batch or two of booze, there's really no justification for using the wrong tool for the job IMO.  Put another way, even if I owned a chisel, I'd still buy a flathead screwdriver to undo a screw.","1383264812"

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","That's understandable. Audit is one of the most popular career paths in accounting which in public accounting means you'll be interacting with clients. Tax and audit are the most popular from what I have seen. There's private accounting too. Some companies do a finance rotation program too. Public accounting is sort of like a fast track to get into a more senior position within a shorter time. There's also government accounting which is what I'm trying to get into. Best work life balance and benefits but pretty low pay compared industry. As for the credits it shouldn't matter if you have a certificate or masters. All that matters is there are lots of firms recruiting at your school. And that you have the requirements to take the CPA exam. Sorry everything's kind of jumbled and probably confusing since I'm a bit distracted and on my phone haha but if you have any questions feel free to ask or head over to r/accounting for some more info too.

"shittyaskscience","t5_2sw51","as humans get older, the velocity of the need to go underground increases exponentially. The reason we bury our dead in boxes or cremate the bodies, is to stop them from going any deeper and interfering with the earths crust or popping out of the ground on the other side of the globe. I trust I don't need to explain what a zombie is. 

Moving on, ancient people did not know this and continued to live without dying, they all felt compelled to be underground so the logical explanation to them was to bury everything and live underground. This lead to problems with a lack of vitamin D from the Sun as well as an INCREASE in the amount of vitamin S (sand) their bodies ingested. most people were turned in to clay. 

The only record of people not turning in to clay is in Pompeii where they covered themselves in volcanic ash in an effort to replicate the suns rays. Volcanic ash only has a shelf life of ~5 years and becomes deadly with little warning. It is estimated that most citizens were frozen in under 5 years, which is why most of them were found ""In situ"".","1383264813"

This film and the book is an emotional roller coaster about friendship, love, family and just plain being social.  Chbosky directs it brilliantly between humor, the euphoria when you're with the right people at the right moment in your life, and the pain and anguish that life can bring to those with emotional scars or events they haven't come to terms with.

Some people approve of censorship when they agree with the censor.  I see this as a very short-sighted and dangerous position.  You agree with censors who oppose apartheid and stop and frisk.  Someone else agrees with censors who oppose gay marriage.  Another who opposes vaccinations.  It goes on and on.  
  
  
You then make the horrendous error of suggesting that censorship should be based on popular belief.  If you take a moment to think about it I think you'll agree that censoring opinions that fall outside the belief of the plurality is a terrible idea.

"mlb","t5_2qrrr","Playing the field causes wear and tear on players, especially over a 162 game season The diving, the bad hops, the stress on their knees, etc. It all contributes to players breaking down.  All non-DH players have to deal with this and play through it.  So my expectation for a pure-DH to make the Hall of Fame is that he had a very long and productive career.  Ortiz did nothing of note until 2003 when he came to Boston.   So when a DH only has 11 ""relevant"" seasons including a significant dip from 2008-2010 and an atrocious 2009, and even his best offensive seasons fell short of the top seasons of many other great hitters, then I have no problem saying that he comes up shy of the Hall of Fame.

I also challenge the assertion that Ortiz's WS OPS is .130 over the next closest guy.  According to baseball-reference,  his career WS OPS is 4th all-time, and his 2013 WS OPS ranks 7th all-time.  Fantastic stuff, but not greatest of all time, let alone by a significant margin.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","One thing that is important to note is that for both Muslims and Christians, the sin of usury was a grave sin and punishable offense.  Currently usury is understood to mean charging *excessive* interest on money lent but for Christians charging any interest at all was strictly forbidden

Ezekiel 18:13 says:
&gt;Lends at interest, and takes profit; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.

and Leviticus 25:35-37
&gt;
“If your brother becomes poor and cannot maintain himself with you, you shall support him as though he were a stranger and a sojourner, and he shall live with you. Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God, that your brother may live beside you. You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him your food for profit.

So Christians were forbidden to lend money for any interest, which is kinda the basis for our **entire** economic system.  However, while both those quotes are from the Torah and apply to Jews as well as Christians, Jews lacked a central authority to dispense punishment for breaking usury laws as Christianity had in the Pope and local Christian magistrates.  Jews thus filled a vital purpose in Christian society and thus there was an impetus to persecute them but not *too* much.

Finally, this eye popping fact I just read from the [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loans_and_interest_in_Judaism#In_Christianity)

&gt;in many European countries, medieval civil law also allowed the monarchs to inherit all remaining income and property that had been acquired by usury upon the death of the Jewish usurer involved.[1] Medieval European monarchs thus supported the Jews and suppressed any attempts to convert them to Christianity since it would deprive the monarch of potential income;[1] in England and France, the monarchs demanded compensation from the church for every Jew who was converted, and, until 1281, the English monarch had the legal right to claim half the property of any Jew that converted to Christianity.","1383264836"

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","'Partially' is a pretty weak term, and that's my point; 4million suns worth of mass &lt;&lt;&lt; a hundred billion.  The second sentence of that about article is just blatantly false, and you yourself can prove it with Kepler's Laws, if you'd like.  The galaxy is 'held together' primarily by dark matter; we know this to be true from measuring the speeds that stars go around the center of the galaxy as a function of radius.  This also means your last two sentences are false - if the SMBH suddenly vanished, only the stars in the innermost few hundred light years would notice at all.  Similarly, if the sun were suddenly replaced by a black hole with the same mass, Earth would keep going its merry way around exactly as it does now (though it'd get a lot darker...).

EDIT in response to your edit: The only thing that gravity cares about is the **total** amount of mass inside the orbit (aka, if you drew a circle of the sun's orbit around the galactic center, what matters is the mass inside the circle); the SMBH makes up a pitiful fraction of that mass for all stars except the ones very close to the center.  We do know observationally that basically all galaxies have an SMBH at the center, but this doesn't at all mean that they're holding galaxies together.  Actually, the formation of SMBHs is something we really don't understand well - in some models, you can get the mass we observe if the black hole slowly accretes more matter over the entire history of the universe, but it's hard to reconcile that with something like the Milky Way's SMBH, which is currently only 'eating' about a millionth of what it could.","1383264836"

I only clay bar once per year, full wax 3-4 times per year, wash and spray wax every few 2-3 weeks except during the spring/fall when I just blast off the constant pollen every now and then with a hose or power washer and finish with some quick detail spray.

Then again I guess I do more than most people I guess. My paint hasn't become any worse since I owned the car but it definitely needs to be detailed and polished at some point. Daily driving straight through the winters has left its share of road rash and there are plenty of swirl marks. 

Would have done the polish job this year except I got laid off in Jan and haven't landed work yet.

I would presume they meant trying to make powder from grinding a chunk of aluminum with a grinding wheel, potentially sending sparks into some mixed powder. Mortar and pestle should be fine, if you need to break up some clumps of iron oxide. It probably won't do much to the aluminum though. It takes a rather hot flame to ignite thermite.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt; I'm sure women will be forced to buy insurance which covers prostate exams.

Nope. Prostate screening is not required in the ACA.

&gt;Men and women both have certain medical needs that are specific to their sex. Lets just agree to spread the cost out instead of denying or making more expensive insurance on the basis of preexisting conditions (like being pregnant).

An economically ignorant position. You're just removing the signaling mechanisms that are needed to lower actual costs, and only care about the price at the point of consumption.

Making someone spot you 4K for a 20K car doesn't make the car actually cheaper. It still costs 20K, and you've ruined the incentive to lower actual costs.







&gt;This is why we can't have nice things. Everyone here seems to be forgetting that men are more likely to be injured in the workplace, more likely to get Alzheimer's, cancer, heart disease - the list goes on. By the logic of people in this thread, men should pay more for insurance than women

Nope, because it's how much healthcare they actually consume, and women consume more.

&gt;Do you still feel the same way now that I've pointed out the shoe is on the other foot?

You mean like it is for car and life insurance?

Other quality is to not be easily opened. This lends itself on the same thing, why would you want it to be opened easily? 

Mine opens easily, but is shatter proof. Peanut butter jar with a slot cut in the lid with my utility knife. 

If you do this, as a suggestion/hint - heat up your util blade and depend on the heat instead of using the sharp edge to cut the plastic.

I dont think you understand it enough because the borrowed energy and particle and anti particle formation that you speak of it actually is all a result of the heisenberg uncertainty principle.

i.e particles and antiparticles are able to exist and borrow energy because the heisenberg uncertainty principle allows energy to exist and pop out of no where, just so long as the time it exists for is small enough not to violate the principle. This means space-time on a small scale, has energy popping in and out all the time.

No true vacuum IS a result of the heisenberg uncertainty principle. if you put two very fine close together plates in space there will be a slight pressure between them for this reason.

I still wouldn't suggest going in without mostly DL gear for your party though, as his tumults hit more times as the fight drags on.

As for the AF2 vs +1 discussion, I played with the cure calculator to show you the differences ( http://valk.dancing-mad.com/?page_id=200 )

Baseline 400 MND, 220 DET, 66 magic damage, your cure 1 will do on average: 
806.33

going from darklight cowl to AF2 body + AK hat (+6 MND, -29 Det): 
805.94

relic to relic +1 (+3 Magic Damage +4 MND +3 DET): 
839.84

So in short, losing 29 Determination from darklight cowl will negate any bonuses you get from MND getting the AF2 body. But! The difference is really only 30 hp stronger cures, there are so many other things that will cause a wipe that 30 hp will not fix, a missed silence, a lag spike, etc. So I would not stress over your upgrade order too much.","1383264847"

The reason why no one is annoyed about the PS4 is because you just need to connect once to download the patch, then you never have to connect to the internet again if you don't want to and you can play the PS4 fine

The XB1 forced you to connect every 24 hours or your entire console would become useless, you couldn't even play single player games

It's the same as showing you a graph of average shoe size vs average performance on a standardized math or reading skills test - that chart would show a very obvious positive trend between shoe size and performance, but would it be because people with bigger feet are smarter/better at math or reading? No, it would be because both shoe size and performance on such a test are strongly correlated to age.

In order to actually demonstrate the kind of correlation the author is trying to show, you would need a *lot* more statistical rigor than that dinky little pos chart. The fact, then, that the author tries to justify his conclusions with this chart demonstrates the he's either A) a fucking moron or B) has no qualms about disingenuous presentation of statistical information to further his own agenda.","1383264850"

If the Quebec educators want to linguistically cripple their children, and force them little choice but to be trapped in a province (and seeing as PQ is effectively chasing away immigrants, you may need every kid you have, whether they like it or not), then I suppose that is their bad decision, and even worse for the kid.

People in ROC don't learn a lot of French because THEY DON'T NEED IT!  The only Anglos that take it seriously are those in the NCR, with aspirations of civil servitude.  You can get bilingual status as a francophone in NCR and not be able to hold a simple conversation in English.  Not so with Anglos trying for the same status.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Asian migrants are far less of a threat than the lack of apprenticeships.  I am open to ideas how to fix that one.  

This points to a larger problem in western economies as a whole.  Costs that used to be paid by employers are now expected to be borne by employees.  Internships, training, tools, etc are now the employee's problem.  Companies (big and small) don't want to deal with an apprentice for a few years, they only want to hire the finished craftsman.  The same applies in professional careers as well.  

Australia is not as bad as America, but it's working on getting there.  ","1383264856"

"mac","t5_2qh4u","Sounds nasty. I think the key is near the end: the suggestion that it is USB transmitted. A generic weakness of Macs and PCs is that if a device plugged in to a USB port identifies itself as an HID (human interface device - keyboard, mouse, trackpad, joystick etc.), the OS will accept it as such even if it's actually something quite different like a flash drive or a USB modem. It can then provide an input stream which may be enough to infect a machine. It is ""typing"" blind, so this is not an easy attack, but it has been demonstrated. Note that this is not the same as a CD with ""autorun"" capability on Windows - that's easy to disable, and is disabled on recent versions of Windows. There's no easy way to disable what appears to be a keyboard from the computer's point of view.

Ok, so what is the USB vector? Well, for an airgapped machine, you need to get data in and out, so a USB stick is one possibility. Alternatively it could be a real keyboard, with some additional software.

BTW, I'm sure Dragos Ruiu has already thought of this, which is why USB is mentioned - I'm not suggesting that I know better than him, just suggesting what his line of thought is.","1383264860"

Olive Oil is a softener when added to the dough early on

Temperature is the key. Preheat you stone for forever, or use a grill. Try the cleaning cycle if you can. If you're only doing one pizza, turn the oven off after preheating the stone for an hour and putting the pizza on- this will help you get the crust done before everything else burns. 

The grill is great because you can stagger the ingredients easily-- throw the dough on, then add sauce, then wait a bit before toppings. Get some unglazed quarry tile- super cheap and foodsafe, and make yourself a stoneware cooking area on top of the grills cooking grate. Works fantastic.


Aging the dough will not help it crisp, in my experience. It does help flavor and allow you to achieve a light-but-strong result- but crispness is all about temperature control.","1383264863"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","First of all - happy cake day. Sorry I missed it the first time. I'm busy milking the system.


Second of all - I don't think that making sure you're comfortable, have voided your bowels, and have a drink for when you get thirsty or need to wake up are examples of milking the system. I think that there is some sort of weird ethic that permeates some workplaces which stipulates that anyone who is not at their workstation cranking out widgets or typing is being unproductive. In fact, when people are allowed to work comfortably, to take breaks, and are given a stake in the enterprise they're a part of, they tend to work a lot harder. And much more importantly - it's a more pleasant place to be. There's no evidence that working 16 hours a day without a break is sustainable, nevermind more productive. I have worked in jobs where my boss counted my hours as somehow being a metric toward my productivity. Shit I'm in one now. And it's foolishness. 


Now - I've done jobs that were more manual where there was slightly more weight to your argument. When I was working in an ice cream place, the customers certainly didn't care if I got my break. But I was a lot less antagonistic toward the workplaces that treated me better, and that also paid off nicely for them in various ways.


But sure - do it your way - every one's a greedy fuck and we should all work as hard as possible all the time or the world's gonna end and we'll all be *shudder* poor! Guess what? We're mostly already poor, everyone's miserable, and all I see is a bunch of people at the bottom blaming each other for being greedy for fighting over scraps.


What I'm positing is - maybe the Calvinist work ethic you are touting is a remnant of a different world, where it was also shitty advice? What if a little regulation and some rearrangement of priorities on the part of our employers would actually make going to work less onerous, getting laid off less anxiety provoking, and in general give us some stability to actual build futures off of? Maybe I'm wrong, but we're living in a world built by your view, and it sucks here. So what I'm saying is - why not explore alternatives that prioritize happiness over profit and challenge some of these precepts that make everyone shitty to each other?","1383264867"

&gt; Inaccurate story/spin! The hospitals are NOT ‘opting out’, they are not refusing to accept insurance, and they are not raising their fees selectively either! It is the insurance companies who are excluding them from ObamaCare plans just to avoid big cost increases and sticker shock on the exchanges. The difference here is really the first widespread sign of the top-down “healthcare rationing” that ObamaCare brings. Top-down vs. bottom-up makes a big difference. If hospitals and providers really could opt in or out of these insurance plans, and insurance prices and plans changed accordingly, then that would at least be more like free market healthcare, where people could choose what they want to buy. Unfortunately, those prices and coverages would still reflect the crazy economic train wreck that is ObamaCare. Instead of choice, we have mandates and administration/media cover-ups (and spin like this story) that seek to hide the truth. Providers are NOT opting out, insurance companies are cutting hospitals out, to cut costs. Repeal and replace ObamaCare...it is failing in every way, except one: to give more control to government, less liberty to consumers.","1383264869"

One of the early formative works on popular religion is Butler's  ""Magic, Astrology, and the Early American Religious Heritage, 1600-1760"" in *The American Historical Review* 84.2. Butler famously takes this work and turns it into the foundation for his pivotal *Awash in a Sea of Faith*, where he, amongst other things, takes on the issue of Christian declension. 

Another historiographic highlight is David Hall's ""Toward a history of popular religion in early New England"" in *William and Mary Quarterly* 41.3

Now, these are pretty old titles. Popular religion--as the monolith ""popular religion"", if that makes any sense--is a bit of a passe topic.

I won't comment on your other points because even though I mostly disagree your arguments have validity and I respect them all.

But about how rich Valve actually is... We only know **approximately** how much the company is worth. Their actual revenue is unknown and is only **estimated** by 3rd-party reports that they have a revenue of about $800m last time I remember, which is just a fraction of what companies like Blizzard and Tencent (owner of Riot) make.

There's a good reason why anyone who speaks out against the cartels either does so anonymously or ends up dead soon after. Gun for gun means nothing. The cartels are either ex-military or career psychopaths without any need for public support while vigilante militiamen only survive if everyone else is shielding them. When you're facing someone for whom brutality has no upper limit and you're tied to public opinion, eventually they'll get bored of entertaining you and just exterminate your entire town. 

The happiest ending this chapter could reasonably hope to have is that the executions are quick and they stop at immediate family. No way in hell are the cartels going to let such a thing continue.

now, if you know a guy is camping or waiting around the corner, you can peek, exposing less of your body. it's good for you because you can look without exposing yourself. it's good for them because it will help discourage jumping, and if they kill you while peeking, good for them for making the acurate shot.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","By same games I meant popular AAA titles which are on everyone agenda. Other then that it's quite obvious(and sad) that each platform has it's own exclusives. 


&gt;looking at the xbox 360's hardware you'd be surprised it's able to run games at the quality it does right now.

Indeed I'm impressed by optimization developers pull off but not about quality which simply is bad for current standards. But I also find consoles being a huge blockade for PC games development with DeusEx:HR being prime example of good game that could be so awesome if it weren't limited by consoles old hardware.


I also disagree about high quality hardware needed to run PC counterparts. Surely PCs needed more power to run same titles due to big architecture difference(which won't be such big issue in the future) but  people like to overdo and compare 720p, ~25 FPS + motion blur on console with 1080p at 30+ FPS, high res textures and AA/Anizo on PCs. Regardless next gen consoles unlike current ones are very mediocre hardware even by current standards.

For me investment in hardware I can't upgrade despite fact it's performance degraded isn't really good. $600-700 rig will run next gen titles fine in better quality and if you upgrade GPU once in it's lifetime(around 3.5 year mark) it will last at least as well as console does. You pay more for both console games and accessories in it's lifetime, not to mention additional monthly fee for multiplayer features. PC is cheaper to maintain so I'd say financial result after 7 years cycle will be same with the difference you upgraded your PC and you have base to rebuild. With console you have to start from scratch and have issues with backward compatibility.The good thing with PC is you won't ever lose access to old titles nor have to hoard old electronics.


&gt;with the pc, the fact that it's multipurpose kinda gets in the way because mentally i'm just alt-tabbing in and out of the game to check on my other tasks running in the background.

Well X1 evolves in exactly that direction so you might ""alt-tab"" on console too :)


In general I'm not against consoles as I see them as low barrier hardware capable of playing good games. Unlike in the past however PC gaming and hardware looks better then ever. With huge success of Steam and upcoming Steamboxes and SteamOS as well as similar x86 architecture in consoles and better multicore CPU optimization I couldn't recommend(if I had to pick one platform) next gen consoles to anyone that is capable to build and maintain PC.","1383264904"

If he asks to keep the child and the woman goes ahead and has an abortion, the woman isn't suffering any consequence.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I think it depends on how exactly you define ""extremist."" Do you mean radically different exegesis or interpretations of religious texts than those in the dominant cultures? Or do you mean groups willing to use violence as a means of survival or influence?

I can say without a doubt there have been plenty of ""extremist"" or radical religious groups going against the grain prior to the twentieth-century. There are even extremists within dominant groups. For example, the [gunpowder plot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder_Plot) I think was a rather extremist attempt to subvert the Anglican Church and reinstall the Catholic church as the hegemonic religion in England.

If you are interested in cults or other extremist groups in the United States I can recommend  Paul Johnson and Sean Wilentz's [The Kingdom Of Matthias](http://www.amazon.com/The-Kingdom-Matthias-Salvation-19th-Century/dp/0199892490). This book follows the creation of a small cult in rural New York during the second great awakening and the rise of a capitalist society in the 1830s. It is truly a great read as it touches on political, economic, social and gender issues of the time and provides a unique look at how religion and material circumstances can come together and form a reactionary movement in opposition to times of radical reformation or social transformation. I bring up this book as it also addresses your question of how people ""viewed them"" as newspapers became fascinated, and citizens enamored, with the tales about the small cult and their crazy antics.

Along with WR, I would say the OL needs to add some depth. After the starting 5, the next man up is Kilgore or Looney and I must say... they weren't very convincing in the preseason.

curry powder is not a specific thing: its blend of spices that you cook with. Generally has a base of coriander, with spices like cumin, peppercorns, turmeric,  fenugreek, or garam masala (another spice mix that uses clove, cinnamon, and a few other things). 

Always buy the spices whole, and use something like a coffee grinder to grind them. This one thing alone will make the biggest difference in the taste and cost of them. Dont buy spices in jars- HUGE ripoff. Go to a health grocery store and get them in bulk- they are incredibly cheap. you can stock up enough for two weeks worth of currys for $5

They take a bit of work to make, but are so tasty. You can make them in bulk, mix them with oil, and freeze them to make a quick curry whenever.

also make a paste of half ginger/half garlic to use in curry- itll keep for like a week in the fridge, much longer if you freeze individual portions of it.


[This](http://www.amazon.com/Great-Curries-India-Camellia-Panjabi/dp/1904920357) is the best book on the whole theory behnd currys, and it will tell you everything you need to know about indian currys. The theory helps you learn to improvise and just throw stuff together. 

all the spices are the base of the flavor, so you can use shitty old veggies or anything, and have it taste awesome and rich. I like using pureed lentils and soy milk to make thick and creamy currys. go great on rice.


Thai currys are my fav, but they take quite a bit more to get into. Indian currys are the best place to start,

Dont be intimidated! oce you learn the basic ingredients and cooking method (fryin the spices and oil and simmering), you can just fuck around, because spices used correctly taste so damn good.","1383264915"

They can entertain possibilities without voiding all options until proven otherwise. They are the ones who say ""these things are likely to exist but we cannot know for sure given eg1 eg2 eg3"". A rational thinker is a very rare thing indeed.

Most self-proclaimed skeptics, however, maintain a null belief set, basically stating that nothing exists until proven to exist. Constricting that view further is that the level of proof is usually defined by a skeptic as whatever the mainstream scientific consensus is at that time.

 \\\\\\\\\\...? 

 \\\\\\\\\\... = Aleph- Null

Even if you didnt know Aleph-Null you still have an ability to recognize infinite set of countable natural numbers.

So it's probably possible to think to certain extent even if you dont know any language.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","If you call handwringing and portents of doom valid reasons to call a policy a failure, by all means.

Sorry, I remain unconvinced by your concerns about what other countries and organizations will think. That tends to change every day as events change, and much of what is said is meant to provoke a reaction that others want. It's all politics and diplomacy, and neither are known for their veracity.

The Saudis know when and why we will act for certain in the Middle East. They sell us that reason by the barrel. They can break with us if they wish, but ultimately they know we are in bed with them for a reason, and they like it cozy underneath the covers far more than they do out in the cold, as do most countries who choose the US as a geopolitical ally.

Past that, US credibility is what it's always been- dependent on pragmatism. If it suits the needs of the US to adhere to our word, we will, and slavishly so. If it does not, then we will not. Anyone who assumes our credibility is any more secure than that is unwise, at best.

As far as the greater Syrian conflict? Very few people inside or outside the beltway are interested in spending any American blood or treasure on the outcome, as it appears that there's no upside to anyone winning at this point. It's become a matter of the devil we know versus the devil we don't, which doesn't matter because they're both still devils in the end.

The US could, and essentially will, apparently, cross its arms and let things play out as they may, and lose nothing in the conflict. Voices said the same thing about losing influence, etc. many other times, in the conflicts in Africa, for example, and to this day, and perhaps rightfully so, the same voices curse the US for not getting involved militarily.

But in the end, America hasn't suffered some geopolitical collapse for their lack of playing world policeman in those situations. Finding a reason to stay out of other people's wars instead of vice-versa is a habit I'd like to see more of truth be told. 

We didn't need to strike Syria, we only had one reason, and that reason was removed, and a danger removed from the table. If the world doesn't like that we avoided attacking yet another country this century, let the cards fall as they may, I say.","1383264924"

Look for iTunes/Google Play review sites that might find your game interesting and talk to them on Twitter a little bit. Follow them and make sure they know your name. After a couple of weeks have passed and you've done favours for them ask them if they could review your app. You could just send them a review code but if you befriend them they'll give you a better rating.

Btw don't just shoot for the really big ones but those that aren't that known yet.

Another option would be to find bloggers that are related to your niche. For instance if I had a productivity app that improves the user's productivity I'd approach those ""lifestyle designer"" blogs and make friends with them as well.

So if your game is a horror game you could search for horror bloggers and see if they occasionally feature apps. Even if not they might be the one who's influential enough to spread word about your game somewhere else. 

Kids game? Find parents that blog about kids activities or bloggers that have kids that might enjoy your game.

Puzzle? Challenge someone that posts about scientific topics to beat your game. Not someone that posts in ""Sciene"" but someone that's more laid back and occasionally posts about random stuff as well.

Retro platformer? Some nostalgic dude that says how cool the 80s were. ""You liked the 80s? Remember how cool games used to be back then? I'm trying to revive that feeling. I only listen to casettes on my Walkman and I'm developing this awesome game that's not quite done yet.""

Just don't overdo it. Find 5-10 medium sized blogs/sites/forums at a time and get into contact with them and the community. Become part of the community.

The key to getting attention on the app store is obviously downloads. So every download helps. One blogger might recommend it to his followers et voila a couple of more downloads. The more contacts you get the higher the chance of someone saying something nice about you.

It's all about increasing your chances of getting ""lucky"" by showing your game to as many as possible **outside** the app store. Someone might know someone at XXX and recommend your game because you are that extraordinarily nice chap ;)

Be where not every other app developer is, outside the app store. Go to where there's the least competition and find the backdoor into the store.

Just keep in mind to keep in contact with those folks, don't use them just for the attention. Oh and don't forget to always send review codes. Everybody loves feeling special because you give him/her a review code. Plus it saves money and everybody loves that.

It's the little things that can result in massive gains.","1383264926"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt; The underlying theme here is that they limit personal freedom in regards to private property.

Given that the disagreement is about the nature of property rights itself, either of us claiming that enforcing socialist/capitalist rules on property is ""limiting freedom"" would be begging the question.

This is why I honestly feel that perfect anarchy - a society in which no coercion is necessary whatsoever - is actually possible.  Property must be defined and enforced in some manner, which means that some people who disagree with it will be coerced into obeying it.

&gt; The end result would be the same. People stealing others property through force and/or coercion.

So from the socialist perspective, the existence of capitalist private property would be a theft of common property from it's rightful owners.

The reason these discussions often go South is that both parties assume the premise that their property system is just and argue from that assumption.  However, as I said before, given that the ultimate question here is ""how is property (legitimately) defined"" we would be begging the question to describe the other's system as ""theft"".","1383264928"

I've decided I simply don't care to work for large firms any more, the interview is just the first step of corporate keystone cop routine you'll deal with throughout your time at the company.

The benefit  to this approach is that startups and small companies just don't have enough people to manage this meat grinder of a hiring process.  And when it comes time to negotiate, there's an actual conversation involved.

My advice, after about 8 years of experience, is to work for a famous name brand for the first couple years and then leverage that brand on your resume to interview at a bunch of places in one week.  Make them compete and pick the best one.","1383264932"

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","I think the key problem here is that your goal is to suppress the worries. 

It's this strange thing but suppressing thoughts actually makes them worse. For example. Please try your best to not think of a white elephant. Don't think of it at all.  Sit for a couple of minutes.

What are you thinking about? I bet it is a white elephant.

It feels backwards but actually accepting that it's okay to have worries and allow them to enter your mind can actually make you worry less. Mindfulness meditation takes this idea (but it can be used outside of meditation) and basically you can notice that you have the worry, accept that is is okay to have the worry, but then move onto the next thought. You aim to notice the worry but not get trapped in the emotions, instead just try to identify the emotions and accept them as they come. 

Still thinking about the white elephant? It takes a lot more energy to stuff something down and push it away than to accept and move on.

I suggest picking up a few spikes online, or you can do what I did which was go to my local art store (Texas Art Supply in Houston, TX) and picked up a few sculptor tool spike things.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I've had extreme cramps since I was 16 (I'll be 38 on Sunday), and while birth control mitigates them, I can't stand the side effects I experience, so I have had to find other ways to cope. 

As glueb mentions, raspberry leaf tea is said to be helpful. It wasn't for me, but why not give it a go?  it's inexpensive and tastes like a slightly berry flavored black tea.

There are also various herbs, such as black cohosh, that are said to be useful for both cramps and menopause.  I've never tried them myself, but again, maybe they're worth giving a go.

What *does* work for me is taking naproxen sodium, i.e. Aleve, as soon as my period begins, because that's almost always earlier than the awful cramps that feel like I've got a herd of elephants stampeding my uterus. It doesn't eliminate the pain, but it muffles it.  Before it was available over-the-counter, my doctor prescribed it specifically for this purpose.  

The other thing that works *phenomenally well* for me is eating a cheeseburger.  That may sound crazy, but hear me out: When we menstruate, our bodies require more calories, and because of blood loss, our bodies lose iron.  Also, some studies have shown that increased calcium during menstruation relieves symptoms such as cramps.  Cheeseburgers are high in calories, iron, and calcium. 

Furthermore, they are comforting--if you like them--and the dopamine hit that comfort food produces eases pain, too. Then there is the sodium component: blood is pretty salty, so losing it means losing salt.  Cheeseburgers are *mad* salty.  

If you're vegetarian or vegan, the burger route clearly isn't an option, but perhaps you could take the general idea of the burger--salty, high calorie, high iron, high calcium, high sodium, protein-bomb of comfort food--and cast it in non-animal terms.

And the BEST thing for my cramps is an orgasm. Especially one that involves both clitoral stimulation and penetration.  It really helps A LOT.

Lastly, I used to have success with marijuana.  Now I can't smoke because it makes me too loopy, but it used to make my uterus and cervix quit causing me agony.","1383264935"

they say 'more than 10' and 'more than 50' and '4' actual terrorist plots have been foiled, but no evidence to back up any of these numbers is really forthcoming. i know if i was running the NSA at this time and I had actually caught real life terrorists in the act, id be parading them all over the news and saying SEE!? ITS WORTH IT YOU GUYS.

the logical conclusion is that there is precious little to show for it in terms of terrorists stopped.

Kirk mold made by former Don Post employees for themselves and all of these 3 were done up as Myers.

There's 5 others that I knew of but am not sure if still exist today, one of them is actually the copy in the picture used by OP, it belonged to a friend of mine named Dante. He sold it decades ago and doesn't remember who he sold it to so I don't know if it still exists today. Of course, one of them is the Hero, it was falling apart in the last known photo when Dick Warlock sold it to a private collector back in 2004.

All of the owners of the copies in its original Capt. Kirk form I know of doesn't want to sell it, it sucks. But, yes, outside of that, it's EXTREMELY hard to find another one. I have came so close several times. Oh, well, just gotta keep digging.","1383264937"

"freedomearth","t5_2t2fu","**Some thoughts on the limitations of written language**

I would like to elaborate on the limitations of human language. In the absence of telepathy, we need different sounds and symbols to describe different things. Thus we label stuff to make things [easier to explain](http://www.reddit.com/r/freedomearth/comments/1l068c/the_big_picture_of_love_by_aegil_santos/cbvay6m). 

We can only make up for the limitations of human language by reminding ourselves of the microcosm and macrocosm, that means to not be offended too quickly and take things too personally. It all depends on your interpretation. We all have that kind of mutual understanding in this forum.

When I talk about [light language](http://www.reddit.com/r/freedomearth/comments/1ncven/can_someone_explain_what_is_this_about/cchj04s), I am referring to highly **abstract** thoughts that are too inconvenient to describe in words. I am not referring to polarity dramas.

**I sensed something was off last year**

When I looked at Michelle Obama’s Wikipedia page about a year ago, I was thinking: “There is something off with her physical features, but never mind, that issue is too small compared to my consciousness development.” 

But it is not harmful to include that as *part* of the big picture of the revelations. A small revelation might make a big difference. So if the slightest racial reference offends you, you might be missing the whole point. u/Valura has explained [it all here](http://redd.it/1o85qi). It all surprised me that there is more to the story than the physical features.

**Nothing is wrong with special needs**

Would you call me against elderly and disable people when I say: “Elderly and disabled people need the appropriate assistance and care.” When I can, I would be willing to provide anything they need, and so will anybody else.

Also it is not harmful to say: “ The electrical engineer may not fully understand what the mechanical engineer is talking about. Unless the electrical engineer learns mechanical engineering.”

The visually impaired need the accessibility features built into any operating system, such as text to speech. This is also useful when your eyes are strained.

Conclusion: This forum is not to single out any race whatsoever. It is to provide the necessary revelations to ALL races.","1383264939"

I would advise not going into the deluxe tier of video card, as you will be paying some heavy premiums for the modest gains. If you went with the tier below, by the time you reach it's limits, prices would have dropped and you could Crossfire for around the same price as the single 290x. That said, maybe consider a single 7970 with plans to crossfire in a couple years? You have the PSU for it after all.  
   
Final thought, you could save a few bucks by going with the 128gb SSD, which proves for most gamers to be plenty of space for the OS/boot apps. Games dont make enough use of an SSD to make them worth installing on them.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","I've worked in the energy efficiency industry for 6 years. It's completely down to our housing stock - we have the oldest in Europe. Victorian houses were extremely well built, and ventilated in a very specific way, but they're not very good at retaining heat. Post-war housing (especially system built houses) are also a nightmare. In fact, even modern houses aren't really good enough, our building regs have been completely inadequate with regards to energy efficiency for decades.

Insulating these properties effectively is extremely expensive. You need external wall insulation on every exposed wall with careful detailing around the roof line, external services etc. You're looking at £15k+ for a decent job. Then you need upgraded windows, doors, loft insulation, a-rated boilers, draught-proofing, floor insulation (which is extremely disruptive and almost always incorrectly installed). When you've done all that you need to sort your ventilation out otherwise you'll run into a host of other problems. The costs just keep racking up for increasingly small returns. 

There's a reason people don't install external insulation at market rates, it would take you about 30 years to pay back. 

Don't even get me started on the financial payback of unsubsidised renewable energy systems.

The bill for adequately improving the UK housing stock would run into hundreds of billions. We'd be better off knocking them all down and starting again. 

We're going to really suffer as a country when energy starts to get really expensive (the current price is still extraordinarily cheap). Hell, people in my county already sit in the dark for 3-4 days a fortnight because they don't have enough money to put on the meter.

"cableporn","t5_2s9v2","Living room is the MOST active room for Ethernet in my house.  Game consoles and set top boxes, Internet enabled TV and Receiver, etc.  I'd bet that most people have at least 4 Ethernet enabled devices by the TV, if not more.  In my case it is the following :

1. TV
2. Home theater receiver
3. Roku
4. Xbox 360
5. PS3
6. PS4 (soooooon)
7. Wii
8. Wii U
9. Raspberry Pi retro gaming system
10. Raspberry Pi based wireless Tor gateway, might get moved into the closet someday
11. Thermostat control/hookup from my power company
12. Gaming PC/PVR/Cable Box/Bluray &amp; DVD player

I recently moved my NAS to the closet, that was another 2 connections, and I had a Cable box and PVR as well whose functionality has since been migrated into the gaming PC.  I hope to get rid of the gaming PC altogether and just hook up one of the new streaming Steam boxes, but we'll see how compatible that is.  In the end though, nearly 15 Ethernet devices in the living room alone and that's not really even THAT weird, since I'd guess that a lot of people have just as many consoles, but add Internet enabled Bluray and DVD players as well!

My oldest daughter has a desktop PC, an old Xbox, an Internet enabled TV, a Wii U, a Retro Pie unit, a networked all in one printer scanner device, and her IP phone.  6 connections in her room too.

The wiring closet has a bunch of back end devices...2 NAS boxes, a file server, a VM host, an Asterix based PBX system running on a pogoplug, a PC based firewall and IDS, a wireless router, all the home automation equipment for sprinklers, doors(we have keyless doors with keypads and RFID readers), and lots more.  Plus, tons of IP cameras, At least 4 that I can remember!  Not even considering all of the bridged networking (file server, for example has 4 physical cables bridged to one IP, NAS boxes have two each, etc.)  I think I have over 20 connections in the closet as well.

2 x 48 port Dell Managed gigabit switches handle all the traffic with 10g in between them.

I realize that I'm a weird use case, because I do this for a living and I like having flexibility and power with technology at home, but I can see even a normal gamer/gadget enthusiast needing way more than 6 connections in the living room, and probably could use 6 in every other room as well.  We even set up an Internet enabled coffee machine for a little while in the kitchen that sat with the radio in there, but we don't really like coffee so I gave the setup to a friend.  My next project is probably some automated aquarium lighting and monitoring, we've just got a little 5 gallon with a Beta fish in it right now but I'd love to get a really cool reef or planted tank, or maybe even an African Cichlid tank, and those can be pretty temperamental so need to be either taken great care of, or automated!

Having lots and lots of jacks is pretty cheap, a few hundred for the cable itself, maybe 1500 feet or so, and $500 each for the switches, and I have never worried that I couldn't do something new in my house.  I regularly set stuff up and tear it down, and having that luxury is way worth the cost to someone like me.  Always over-plan your infrastructure!

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I don't understand the hate for Doran Martell. Among the leaders of the great houses he is so far my favorite character. Granted, his plans have not worked out (yet... or have they?), but he is clearly the most deliberate of the major lords before committing to action. He is also taking advantage of the fact that Dorne is remote and removed from the strife elsewhere in the kingdom, and is clearly biding his time before making a major move. If I had to choose where I had to live in Westeros, Dorne is looking pretty good right about now. It's essentially untouched by war. They've got control of a key hostage in Marcella, and have not really committed to supporting anyone except their own interests, while at the same time they've not really positioned themselves as a real threat to anyone either. Right now at the end of ADFD there is major potential for conflict between the Tyrells and the Lannisters, and Dorne can pretty much ride it out. And, we're not completely privvy to his total game plan yet, either, so he may have other tricks up his sleeve. I'd say that Doran has done well by his people so far, Oberyn and Quentyn's fates notwithstanding. About the only thing that he's done that I don't agree with is leaving his heir apparent Arianne in the dark about his plans at the beginning, which led to the whole Arys Oakheart/Myrcella FUBAR.","1383264952"

"MapPorn","t5_2si92","The difficulty now seems to be whether or not it's pertinent to regroup the Arab peninsula countries all the way to north Syria and west to Tunisia. If this is only about language groups, sure, they all speak Arabic. Otherwise, culturally, ethnically and historically, they're pretty different. 

Otherwise, the Savoie French aren't really a thing... If the Occitan aren't a thing, the Savoie French definitely aren't. I'd be willing to accept the Nice region as its thing (not part of Italy though), but if you want to have Savoie, you need Occitan. I wouldn't include either.

Ultimately, for France (which, granted, is a tricky one considering its diversity and how it was ""Francisized""), I'd keep only Brittany, Basque country, Corsica, Alsace and Flemish France (though the latter really is quasi non existent today, so I'm not sure of that one - but the fact that you made it really small seems OK to me, considering there's not much left of it). Notice I only feel that the acceptable ones are regions where the language and culture are significantly (to a certain extent) different from standard French. Because if you start dividing with Savoie and all, you may as well divide all the cultural/historical regions of France. Thing is, the French as an ethnic group can be classified as the amalgamation of all the French dialects. It's part of the historical culture of France to make it one, to standardize its people, thus only those from a whole different language family can really claim to stand out now. The Catalan and Nice regions of France make me hesitate a little though. ","1383264957"

We gave him gift cards to buy books, he received an ipad from my aunt and gift cards for the itunes store (sorry to sound like an apple commercial). He's into math and science so there are lots of great puzzle game apps. A netflix subscription is great for laying around and watching movies. And, hate to say it, but hats are good too. Warm clothes. Blankets. Subscriptions to any favorite magazines. I also cooked for him a lot, he seemed to appreciate that. Lots of high-fat food to help with weight loss. Ice Creams, soups, stouffers. Green tea.

Probably goes without saying, but spending time with him is good too, just being there for him.

2011 game 4 of finals he sprains his ankle in game 4 of finals

He then refuses treatment, and an MRI then goes against using high-tops. After game 4 he said it was the ankle. After game 5, he said his foot loosened up. 

Wtf? A foot doesn't loosen up when you have an ankle sprain. Your ankle can maybe warm up and get the adrenaline going.. But it sure is different than a foot. Something Kobe well knows the difference between. 

Tl, dr: game 4 2011, Kobe gets a sprained ankle and refuses treatment and MRI. Game 5 he then goes for many dunks and doesn't seemed phased by the ankle at all. Then goes to say his foot loosened up instead of his ankle.","1383264961"

I don't know how they figured out the schizo, I think it was because he was always talking to himself/people he could hear but nobody else could. He heard voices, and sometimes it was like he was/is multiple people. He's been on drugs for it forever, that's all I know.  Besides the freak-outs of course.

I don't know how the hell my brother got the wrench, I'm guessing that since this was before my folks put deadbolts on the doors (to keep him in) he ran outside to the garage, grabbed one from here, and ran back in with it. Because killy.

He went after everyone, but he focused his ire on me. He listened to my sister because she had to watch him so much that she became like a second mom. Poor girl. But I was his punching bag, or at least I was the only one smaller than him and I couldn't defend myself.","1383264962"

"india","t5_2qh1q","I'm not a Rahul Gandhi supporter and I don't live in India. However, I try to keep myself informed about Indian Politics and I have since I was a teen so disclaimer etc., etc. Here are reasons I think people may support him:

 - **Party loyalty**: Some people are fiercely loyal to the party and will just vote for that party's candidate. So it's simply party-line voting just like we have in the US where a Republican may vote for another person simply because that person is Republican.
 - **Loyalty the to the Gandhi family**: The Gandhi family has a sort of cult of personality starting all the way from Nehru (the first Prime Minister of India). Nehru's daughter Indira Gandhi was Prime Minister, as was her son Rajiv Gandhi. Now Rajiv Gandhi's wife Sonia Gandhi is the leader of the Congress and her son Rahul Gandhi might be a PM candidate. There are people who love the Gandhi family and may therefore be supporting Rahul Gandhi solely for this reason.
 - **Anti BJP/Right/Nationalist**: Some people don't like the rightward slant of the BJP and so may opt for Congress (and therefore Rahul Gandhi) because they perceive it as being more ""secular"" (though that is up for debate). There are also people who (despite the SC ruling) think Modi and therefore the BJP is responsible for killing Muslims in Gujarat, and that this may happen all over India, and that the BJP will push for minority-unfriendly legislation. Hence they may be drawn to the Congress for this reason as well.
 - **Pro left, liberal**: People who are way to the left may support Rahul Gandhi as well because Congress is perceived to be more left-leaning/secular.
 - **Minority-friendly legislation**: There is definitely a section that will vote for Rahul Gandhi just because of this. There is a lot of politicking done by the Congress to appease its minority votebank (for example, the recent Communal Violence bill). People who want more of this kind of legislation may vote for Rahul Gandhi for this reason as well.","1383264966"

I too have varying levels of orgasm. It feels great, but sometimes I dont quite feel finished. My bf also notices the comtractions, and my reactions certainly lead him to believe I orgasmed...its alot of patience, communication, and learning each others bodies. 

She may not even know what she really needs for the intensity. For me it changes. The mood, the foreplay, the setting; everything needs to be comfortable. 

Now, its different for every woman, but 15 min isnt enough for me. Personally, teasing, edging, massages; all great things to help. Maybe she wants carnal, maybe she wants passion. You dont need to confront her about anything, just go on a journey together in finding intimacy. 

Good luck you two!

Morrison wrote the series from 2002-2004, and he laid the groundwork for tons of stuff that is still happening in X-Men stories. After that, Joss Whedon's Astonishing X-Men is the next best to read.

If you want to read Iron Man, start with Matt Fraction's Invincible Iron Man, it's pretty much the definitive modern take on the character.

For Spider-Man, check out Dan Slott's Amazing Spider-Man, starting with the story arc ""Big Time"". Slott's been writing Spider-Man for years now, and that's the best place to jump on.

A good way to read a lot of comics is Marvel's [Marvel Unlimited](http://marvel.com/comics/unlimited) subscription service, especially if you have a tablet to read with. For $10/month or $70/year, you can read basically everything Marvel's ever printed that's at least six months old.","1383264973"

""&amp;gt;"" If you place the symbol in quotes to the left here in front of a sentence *without* the quotes, then you get:

&amp;gt; This right here.

Hope that helps.

&amp;gt; the idea is unity, unifying ourselves

Not a bad idea.  A logo is not needed for that though.  The disciplined adherence to a *principle* is what's needed.

&amp;gt; stop being ashamed to be a conspiracy theorist.

It's not about being ""ashamed"" of anything.  It's about being intelligent enough to understand that, as I already said, the world ""conspiracy"" was absolutely taken over by TPTB and twisted into being associated with what is generally seen as *not* being critically minded.

I work diligently at being a critical thinker.  I don't need to shield behind the words ""conspiracy theorist"" - especially when those that the words apply to have been considered a joke for nearly as long as the phrase itself has been coined (and it likely got coined for the specific reason and purpose *of* labeling and ostracizing those that criticize and don't agree with the state's narrative and the government's version of events).

&amp;gt; With Snowden ousting the NSA and the amount of time since 9/11, it's no longer something to be ashamed of.

Again, I'm not ashamed - and the main reason I'm not ashamed is because I actually don't *relate* to that term.  So how can you be ashamed of what you don't even identify with?  Silly really.

&amp;gt; We are ostracized b/c we are not unified. Get it?

I got that a *long* time ago, and for you to think that it's in anyone acknowledging that they're a ""conspiracy theorist"" that this unification rests indicates that you yourself have a LONG way to go before you realize what it *really* is indeed that will cause us to be unified.

It's not in a group of words - especially ones that have been taken over by TPTB.  Its in abiding by a principle of critical scrutiny, intelligence, and investigative discipline.  Unification is indeed beneficial.  Labels and categories be damned, however.

&amp;gt; I'm going with an inverted all-seeing eye.

If that's what *you* relate to and makes *you* feel better, then okay.  So be it.

&amp;gt; That's the logo, tell your friends.

I don't have any real friends to tell - and even if I did....well, you know what I would probably do (or, more applicably, not do).","1383264976"

"Liberal","t5_2qxt5","&gt; Actually, I do care about fairness. 

If so then why do you put unfair burdens on female voters? In Texas it is state regulation that married woman use a hyphenated form of their name (maiden name-married name) on their drivers licenses. Men don't have to. The legislators knew this. Then they passed a law that they knew would only adversely affect woman. How is that fair?

&gt; Why should we not also prove who we are to vote? 

No one disputes that. NO ONE. Tell me where in the US people can vote without any ID?

&gt; Why do you think that needing a government ID to vote disenfranchises anybody? 

I don't. I think setting up the rules for who qualifies so that it disproportionately affects, SURPRISE!!, voters who mostly vote democratic party disenfranchises people.

&gt; Other states that have enacted voter id laws have actually seen an increase in voter turnout among minorities. Do you view that as disenfranchising voters?

You need to give specifics. I don't read minds.

&gt; What is so difficult about filling out your voter registration to match the name on your government issued ID?

That isn't what happened. She was already on the voter rolls and had no control over it. On the voter registration rolls she was registered as first name last name. On her drivers license it was first name maiden name-last name. That's a classic double bind. You pass a law that forces people to use one form of their name and then pass a law that forces them to use a different form and then don't let them vote.

**That's cheating.** You are a bunch of cheaters. You dishonor your country.

&gt; if you would kindly engage in a rational discussion and refrain from name calling,

No, there is a history in the south of the whites disenfranchising non-whites in order to maintain power. Now it looks like they are trying to disenfranchise women, students, black and hispanics for the same reason. I'll call that what it is. Immoral, cheating, lying, dishonest. I think it calls into question ""your"" (right wing conservatives) honor and your patriotism. You might as well wipe your ass with the flag. You disrespect our nation, our laws, our traditions.

Find another ditto from friend safari which has perfect iv in the other stats.(e.g ditto with perfect satk and sdef)

the motivation to rob a bank can be rehabilitated. but much like being gay can't be changed, if you find prepubescent kids attractive, you'll probably feel this way your entire life, and you *should* have a permanent red letter on your head, because sexual predilections are hard wired

being gay is ok, because everyone involved can consent. but a child can never form informed consent in sexual matters. so you're doomed

mother nature is unfair. she gives really good people cancer. she gives innocent kids cystic fibrosis. and if she gives you the desire to have sex with prepubescent children, you've been randomly selected to suffer, through no fault of your own, just random genetics. there is nothing but suffering for you for the rest of your life, because you have a sexual impulse constantly egging you on to do something you can never ever do

if i were a pedophile, i would go live in a lighthouse or greenland. in many ways, being a pedophile is incompatible with a normal life in regular society, permanently. you have to constantly deny your real nature. that's not easy to do an entire life without a moment of weakness

This is a policy that was on the books for 70 years (and counting) in which men with guns were sent to attack people growing and smoking plants.  *Plants*.  What happens when you overturn the war on marijuana?  Is the state, then, perfect?

Well, no, because it'll still be throwing ecstasy users/manufacturers in jail.  It'll still be throwing cocaine users/manufacturers in jail.  It'll still be throwing opium users/manufacturers in jail.  The war on drugs will not meaningfully change, except that DEA budgets will be cut due to a lack of enforcement against marijuana, and other drugs will run free... until they get caught.

The cycle repeats, and during this *extremely* slow march towards *the perfect society* we have to hope that you, the majority, don't go jumping off the fucking deep end again persuaded by the next Harry Anslinger that this or that is dangerous and that the government should be used to protect people from themselves.  That's why I think your government is a dangerous organization that should absolutely be dismantled while it still can be.","1383264996"

**Summary:** We want to increase diversity with summoner spell choices in League of Legends. Additionally, we’ve done our annual overhaul of masteries and you can check them out in-game.

**Summoner Spells**

Certain summoner spells have become firmly entrenched within the League of Legends metagame while others have stagnated. We are tweaking summoner spells to make picking non-standard summoner spells a reasonable choice.

**Ghost**

    Cooldown rescaled to 180/160/140/120 from 180
    Now grants 15% Multiplicative Movement Speed from 27% Additive Movement Speed
    Grants 75% Multiplicative Movement Speed in the first second
    Now immediately updates your pathing on cast
    Ghost cannot be cast if you are immobilized

**Ignite**

    Damage rescaled based on game time
    Now also reveals the target for the duration.

**Exhaust**

    Attack Speed reduction reduced to 30% from 50%
    Movement Speed reduction rescaled to 30/35/40/45% from 30%.

**Heal**

    Now a targeted spell, casting this on yourself will target you and the closest nearby ally
    Cast Range increased to 900 from 600
    Cooldown reduced to 180 seconds from 300 seconds
    Grants 30% movespeed to both targets for 1 second

**Teleport**

    Cooldown reduced to 180 seconds when targetting an allied building
    Cooldown increased to 300 seconds when cancelled or interrupted

**Cleanse**

    Successfully cleansing an effect that prevents you from moving creates a shockwave that knocks nearby enemy's back slightly.

**Smite**

    Cooldown lowered to 40 sec.
    Damage reduced at early character levels, same damage at level 18.

**Clarity**

    Now only available on Howling Abyss

**Revive**

    Now only available on Dominion

**Masteries**

Masteries that amplified summoner spells have been removed, as they unfairly penalized players who adapted to the enemy strategy by selecting summoner spells outside their preferred tree.

    Masteries have been updated.","1383264997"

"IrishHistory","t5_2tlyg","&gt;The Fitzgeralds and the other Anglo Irish were a hybrid with alliances and feuds with Anglo Norman &amp; Gaelic families. They also had the Butlers to the south.

I was pointing out that they were not a 'tuath' - so your assertion about this was incorrect - and succession and leadership for the FitzGeralds therefore were not ordered by Brehon law but by English Common law.  They were representatives of Crown interests - Lord Deputies -  and their great rivals for this position were the Butlers.  

Ireland was definitely regarded as being a possession 'unit' at the very least since the granting of the Lordship of Ireland by Papal decree to Henry II.  The seizing and establishing  of the title 'Kingship' had more to do with the break with Rome than anything else. 

The Silken Thomas rebellion was far from rash and illogical.  You need to read up more. 

Surrender and regrant was on the menu as you call it, from the initial Anglo-Norman invasion - its failure was the issue, not its absence.  But it was not a new concept for Ireland or the Gaelic Lords.  

The rest of your answer is rambling and incoherent to me.

Just to add to that, you don't really have self-control without *information* to make decisions with. Sometimes people try to ""control themselves"" blindly, which often mutates into ""if only I make myself feel guilty enough, my health will improve."" (Doesn't work.)

1. Record your calorie intake and what foods contribute to our ""budget"" for the day.
2. Record your weight every morning into a smartphone or spreadsheet so that the actual multi-day trend can be revealed.

A major requirement for the long-term stability of a national economy is the birth rate (or immigration rate, but that's another story) which I believe is pegged at 2.1 children per woman.   Many people who push for population control, or more specifically that we should have less children fail to realize just how dangerous that line of thought can be for the survival of a culture. 

Edit: Just so everyone is clear, the issue I'm talking about is the population replacement rate of a country.  The international issue of global overpopulation is one I recognize, but it doesn't extinguish the fact that a lot of western nations are suffering from a replacement rate that will not sustain its economy.

From the very first council of Jerusalem at the time of the founding of the Catholic Church it's discussed and deemed irrelevant to Christians. Of course ethnic Jewish-Christians in the Middle East were still practising it, but only as a continuation of their inherited customs. 


In Jewish Law circumcision marks a male baby's part in the covenant in which God promises to look after the Jewish people in return for Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac, but according to mainstream (Catholic, mainstream Protestant) Christian doctrine God's sacrifice of his own Son, Jesus, ended the need for this sealing of the covenant by law/ritual as according to Christianity a Christian can be saved by Faith in Jesus alone.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","This, to me, is the correct response. I am not counseling people against OC of long arms because it isn't their right (it is), but because *it's a part of being a courteous member of society*. 

One of the biggest social problems in this country are the people who say, ""I've got my rights, your feelings don't matter."" To quote the old mantra, ""You're not wrong, you're just an asshole."" Yes, you have the right to OC a longarm, but considering there really isn't an advantage to doing so over a pistol, why do it?

Implicitly or explicitly, if you OC a longarm you are just rubbing it in the faces of those around you. That's not the way to normalize guns in the eyes of detractors. I fully support the right of anyone to OC a longarm, but that doesn't mean you should do it, especially if you don't have a valid reason for doing it. 

An analogy: Legally people are allowed to stand on a corner and be obscenely racist. Still doesn't mean anyone should do it. I'd support that persons right to do it, while still disagreeing with everything that person is saying.

When I was a teenager, about 16ish, sometimes when I'd stay over my best friend's house, his younger sister who would have been 14 then would sometime sleep on the couch in the living room. My friend's room was in the basement so whenever I needed to use the bathroom, I'd have to go upstairs.

Long story short, whenever this would happen, I'd always have this thought of sticking my dick in her mouth and see what would happen. If she'd freak out and bite it off, start beating the shit out of me, or would she freak out for a second, realize what was happening, then...go along with it and we'd never speak of it again.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","For all the naysayers, my neighbor/friend just went through this. She was working for one place while getting her doctorate which they were aware of and when she would earn it. They made no attempt to see where she wanted to be in the future, what they might offer her.

Flash forward to the day she gives them 2 weeks notice after earning her doctorate to take a more senior position for much better pay. ""Can you give us a few days? We're pretty sure we can match their offer."" She had assumed there was no such position available because everything they had said suggest this. She would have preferred to stay at the first place, liked her environment &amp; co-workers. But, had she backed out of the job offered by the second she would have left them scrambling to fill it.

SECOND EXAMPLE: This also happened to my roommate who is a glass artist. She had already gone through having to ask for raise from the store she worked for when she felt the type of jobs they were giving her obviously indicated they recognized how skilled she had become (she was also frequently assigned to be the rep because her social skills were better than the owner's). So it felt like they were just being cheap, waiting until she asked for it to save money. 

This also backfired on the store - she had been considering moving to a larger city with more opportunity for artists and when I told her that a room in the rental house I had was coming open in a few months she decided to take the plunge. Knowing her boss could be a bit churlish, she waited until a few weeks before (and before he could take a large job that would depend on her) to tell him. Yep, he was not happy.

Seems that his only rival in this town had decided to retire and wanted to sell his shop to him. As part of the plan to buy it, he was counting on having my roommate actually run the 2nd shop. Now, that was not possible. His other employee was clearly not the manager type (and in fact, drank himself to death less than a year later).

My roommate currently does work out of our garage and in the last couple of months has more work than she wish she had. ","1383265014"

That being said, it's not inconceivable that they are doing it more out of jest. For example, let's say you're alone pushing the mid lane and the jungler come in to gank you. You make an epic leap backwards to avoid 2 ults, then you see that the solo lane has rotated over to you and is right where you landed. You pull some super pro jukes to avoid 6 basic attacks and retreat into the jungle. The jungler is back, and you juke his damage and make another epic leap to escape, and just when you land, you find that the enemy tank has come and pops his ult to take the last 5% of your health. 

After you die in a situation like this, saying GG doesn't necessarily mean that you've given up. It could mean ""oh man, what were the chances of that"", or ""omg so close to getting away!"" and say GG in jovial frustration.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;But it would be inaccurate to then say that we aren't using the same theorems and logic as the ancients did.

The charge made was that ""Everything that's proven mathematically is true forever.""  I disputed that and gave counter-examples, showing that things proven in one system can be disproven in another, and neither-nor in yet another.  There was also the claim that ""Mathematicians today use the same theorems and the same logic and the same systems as those two thousand years ago.""  I do not recall *any* ancients coming up with even first-order logic, or *any* axiomatic set theory whatsoever, both of which only saw the light of day within the past hundred years or so.

Neither of the above, previously-given statements are true.  It is no matter of philosophy -- it is a matter of truth.  Even given in the framework of prepositional logic, those statements yield false as a value.

Modern logic is more rigorous -- composed of relationships and axioms, and not of words.  The logic of the ancients is more fallible -- composed mostly of words, as with prepositional logic, and observations, as with classical mechanics.  The same goes for many of their theorems, and experiments justifying them.  Even hundreds of years ago, proofs were given of mathematical certainties -- even within this century -- and yet more than a handful of them have been disproven even in the very systems they were ""proven"" within.  Gödel's work invalidating Russel's book is demonstration thereof.  We should, of course, not dispense with the wisdom of old, but recognize its shortcomings and incorporate it into a more worthy framework.

It is never admissible to speak that beyond a shadow of a doubt, any thing is proven.  Proven within some limited artificial framework perhaps, but that does not extend to nature or the mathematics that may or may not describe nature.

&gt;In any event Euclid's proof that there are infinitely many primes ports over into ZFC in an obvious way. 

And tell me, does Euclid's geometry stand unmarred in the face of modern physical theories?  Is spacetime as we now know it to be, modelled by Euclidean geometry, as the man himself envisioned?  Even the wisest of the ancients still fell short of the mark.  Even the wisest among us today, fall short of the mark.  No man can claim certainty of truth.  We can only look at the evidence available to us and reason toward our own satisfaction.","1383265015"

I can't express how silly any criticism of his vocal talent is under those circumstances.  Maybe Blizzard should shell out for backup singers for him, and the studio time to rehearse with them, or the vocal coaches to help him improve his singing . . . do you see what I'm getting at?  He takes his own time and talent to write these incredible parodies.  Blizzard probably sends him a ticket to go to WCS and maybe he gets paid, I don't know, but OH MY GOD I can't believe I'm still typing this.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","It's a known fact that lifting weights burns more calories than cardio does, and the best thing about lifting is you are able to isolate. You're still using energy to move the muscles, but now you're doing them with weights. Everyone is different, but I found that lifting moderately heavy (not nearly your max) and doing every exercise at 4-5 sets with 10-15 reps gets me the most ripped. Just know that I'm not lifting for size,  I just want the development of the muscles. That's what gets them hard as a rock and defined. You're still building muscle this way, but it takes way longer than conventional 'bulking' routines.
Try doing what I told you, as it might work for you. 5 exercises for EACH muscle at 4-5 sets 10-15 reps. Every time. It's tough, but believe when I say you'll start to see changes. Also please make sure you incorporate a day to work on your legs and calves. 
My split goes as the following: chest/tri, back/bi, cleans/calves, shoulders, then legs on the 5th day. On the 6th I usually go and work arms or whatever muscle I feel is lacking. 7th day is off. 
Clean up your diet, eat high protein low carbs (you'll get carbs from shakes and veggies), this will get you insanely ripped if you eat like this for 3 weeks. Given you have some muscle development of course. Good luck man, I know you can do it! ","1383265016"

&gt;So to extrapolate to the issue at hand, you are saying that our base moral should be report rape. However, that could be mitigated by the fact that it might do harm to the person reporting it. Is that fair to say?

I think I see where you're going with this, but yes. The immorality of not reporting would be mitigated if it could do harm to the person. That's not to say that it still wouldn't do a lot of other people good, though.

&gt;So that person is immoral since he/she didn't report it? What about children, would they be immoral for not reporting a rape? What if the rapist was a family member? Are you immoral if that is a hindrance to your reporting it?
Do you see how tricky it gets when you attach moral judgements to difficult, nuanced situations?

Actually, I think the answer it still yes, it would still be immoral. Unless literally the entire police force raped you, then there should be someone who can help you. If it's the entire police force, then you can go somewhere else and report your rape. 

My point is this: there's always another option and no matter how painful it is, it is most likely worth it to endure that pain so that numerous other people don't have to. If it's a family member, do you really want to allow them to rape other people in your family? If it's the police, aren't there probably a lot more people affected by this? You are correct that all of those things are hindrances, but they do not prevent you from doing the right thing to help other people.

I've said a couple times that this is a hard thing to do. Very hard. Especially if the rapist is someone you know. But if you think about all the other people that person comes in contact with, your friends, your family, isn't it unconscionable to sit there and do nothing when you know they're at risk?","1383265018"

&gt;You are an example of someone that isn't worth having arguments with.

And yet, here you are, trying to argue.  LOL.

The economic side of the argument is that WOTC is a major corporation.

I was freaked out by the suggestion and honestly nervous as hell to try it but I agreed to be open minded and see what might happen. After about 5 dates with hesitation from both parties to actually do the deed we started to give up about the notion of having sex with another couple. One night while sitting at a local bar, we struck up a conversation with a rather hot couple and low and behold we ended up in the sack with them. We both truly loved it and I found out I ain't as nervous as I thought I would be. Anyway you could say we both knocked it up! ","1383265019"

This was a different problem of some sort. Literally the entire platoon all of a sudden got our coms back at the same time. Some never lost it, or didn't notice, but the 2 dozen people in our teamspeak channel noticed that it just started working again for everyone at once.

Aside from the OP problem, the VOIP bugs are one of the most game breaking bugs that have been around since beta.

Most recent new fix I have had for the voice issues is deleting the entire voice section in the user ini. Helped a bit. Still have this bug multiple times a day and the ONLY way to fix it it reliably, is to relog. Worst part is, if you are platoon leading the bug is more prevalent. Really throws off the flow when you have to relog as platoon lead. ","1383265020"

 And then the crafting should be more like a rare drop from chaos elemental, souls from all bosses and then the ectoplasm. This will truly make it an end game item that you will only use when necessary and not spam it.

Altogether your repairs and reserves total $575/unit...as I broker I put this number at $500/unit and know that it is really more like $700. Make sure you're not underestimating this...though I can't be sure of what's the right amount in your area.

Finally, may I ask why you have two fees for management and on-site management? 12.6% is very high for total management fees...

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;But they are responsible because they vote to give politicians the power to steal money from me to give to them. They are equally responsible.

Equally responsible? Don't be ridiculous. Individual voting, especially the two-party federal system we have in America, is an extremely weak influence on actual government policy. Even then, the inherent ethical problem comes from the theft, not from how the thieves spend their loot, which is the only part that most welfare supporters consistently vote to support. Anyways, I already attempted to address the weak extent to which voting is anti-consensual: all voting is an effort to gain influence over a violence-based power structure; voting for certain kinds of use of this power, rather than others, is irrelevant.

&gt;other's weakness, even their suffering and death are of no concern to me unless their weakness and suffering costs me money that I earned. Then it is a concern of mine.

Their weakness doesn't cost you. Government theft is what costs you. I have a tendency to explain social/economic phenomena as more complex than people want to admit, but this is simple. When someone steals from you under threat of violence, they are the ones who are harming you, and not the people whose interests the thieves claim to be supporting. If someone steals from me and says ""I'm doing this for ZapPowerz"", am I to blame you for the theft? What if they actually give it to you? What if you advertise to them to get more of their money (which happens to be stolen)? How do any of these things make you guilty of violence and theft against me?","1383265030"

Also, 12 apps is absolutely nothing in the online world of applications. You probably need to set out your tier 1-5 companies, and then apply to them. Send out about 3-5 apps a day until about November and then quit for finals. Then after new years pick it back up. ","1383265035"

It's a combination of things like this. It's also similarly hard for a LoL player to switch to DotA, although I would say it's slightly easier this way, as DotA adds things, and doesn't take much away.","1383265035"

vreli = vrelf

v1i-v2i = v1f-v2f

The various National Guards, all of which are part of their states, but there is currently debate on them being run by the federal government, and even having some states consolidate together with others.  Drinking age, and recently in NYC smoking age.  That's off the top of my head.

Don't forget, there are a large number of states' rights which aren't under much debate, and thus don't get the moniker applied to them, such as education being mostly a state thing, roads, even a majority of welfare is done by the states.  To even call it 99% simply shows a lack of knowledge on the subject of American politics.

Edit: Keep in mind, the closer the government is to you, the more power you have over it.  For example, if the federal government is doing something that you don't support, you pretty much get to bend over and take it.  On the other hand, if the power is closer to home, and your city is doing something you don't support, change is often relatively easy.  A few loud voices and things often change at the city level, and to a lesser extent at the state level.  States' rights, along with the accompanying localities' rights and personal rights means moving the power of the government closer and closer to the governed, giving the people more power, not less.","1383265037"

No, but in the context of population stability as a policy target I'm wary of it.

Really, looking at first world vs third world the best way to put the brakes on population growth is economic prosperity. People get richer and stop having so many kids. I'm biased towards targeting shared prosperity and letting population take care of itself. Particularly when economic prosperity tends to be a fellow traveler with productivity and technology improvements which increase carrying capacity for population.","1383265039"

I ask because for my company, we'd obviously try to avoid unnecessarily reloading systems - in part because most of our users are in other states and would have to ship their systems and because it takes some time, no matter how automated your process might be - but still, if someone really wanted their system reloaded, it wouldn't be a big deal.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I'd agree.  Jews were very widespread well before 70AD (the destruction of the Temple).  I don't have the source off the top of my head but Alexander the Great's Empire 'opened up' the wider Mediterranean for Jews to properly settle in Greece (although I wouldn't be at all surprised if they were there in smaller numbers before) and well before that there were communities in Egypt. Herodotus writing in the 450sBC mentions that he has heard of a people called Jews who live in Judea and Egypt.  

Josephus, a Jewish Roman author (who defected during the revolt) is a good read if anyone is interested in how Roman Jews saw themselves. Just be aware he is writing an 'Apology' so comes with quite a bit of baggage!

I'm doing an Ancient History MA and am Jewish so that part of history interests me. ","1383265044"

I do occasionally try freelance graphic design, but in general it's a REALLY tough industry, and just isn't for me.

The average graphic design job consists of finding a request by someone on one of tons of websites that do this sort of thing, fulfulling the request, and then submitting the finished work along with dozens of other people's who also took the job. Then the person that placed the order chooses the one out of dozens they like best and pays the person that made that one. The rest just wasted a whole lot of time an effort.

Needless to say, i really don't want to get into graphic design as a job.

http://www.reddit.com/wiki/moderation

&gt; Finally, moderators have specific controls for managing submissions and comments. They can remove them when inappropriate, approve them when they have been erroneously removed, **distinguish official contributions**, and mark them ""nsfw"" as a courtesy to their users.

&gt; Posts that you make within your subreddit will have a ""distinguish"" button on them. By clicking it, you can ""add an [M]"" to your post to mark it as official.

As a moderator your job is to *manage*, you ensure that the rules of the subreddit (if any) are followed and you take opportunities to grow the subreddit and provide value to subscribers. You **are not** some sort of ""celebrity"" that deserves to stand out in front of every other subscriber.

Your comment in this thread: 

&gt; I really think it's a good thing. I get where Rap Genius is coming from but if the album isn't out yet, the lyrics shouldn't be, too. I'm glad they complied.

Was **your personal opinion** and was not made on behalf of this subreddit, it was not made officially, it was your opinion. There was no need to distinguish it. Your person opinion is no more valid than anyone elses, but you made it stand out, as it was. That is disrespectful to everyone else that commented on this post. You don't seem to understand that there **is** a difference between a normal comment a distinguished comment, if there wasn't then the option wouldn't exist!

The option exists so that moderators (who *manage* the subreddit) can communicate effectively with subscribers; when a subscriber sees a distinguished comment (in a properly managed subreddit) they know that it is being posted on behalf of the subreddit, the comment is not from the user, it's from a *moderator* on behalf of the subreddit.

The difference is between an on duty police officer and an off duty police officer. When an on duty police officer tells you not to climb a fence, they're telling you that on behalf of the law you are not permitted to climb a fence. If an off duty police officer tells you that they love Eminem; they're talking as a *person*. When you distinguish a comment you are acting as an on duty officer; you are just a conduit through which subreddit information flows.

You need to act like a janitor, not like you're a celebrity that deserves more attention than anyone else.","1383265048"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Janna
Summary: Janna’s global passive has been converted to a localized area (equivalent to sight range).
Howling Gale’s AP ratio has been significantly lowered but gains a scaling AP ratio per second it is charged. Zephyr’s self-haste and slow amount on the active cast now scale with AP although the base slow has been lowered. Eye of the Storm’s bonus AD given to allies now scales with AP. Monsoon remains unchanged.
Context: We’ve been saying for a while that we wanted to change all global passives that provide a lot of “hidden” power, like Twisted Fate’s old passive, and were finally able to tackle Janna’s Tailwind passive with her new utility scaling. The Howling Gale change looks like a significant nerf to Janna’s AP ratio, but the additional AP scaling per second means that Janna will need to fully charge her Howling Gale in order to do high damage at end game with her additional Ability Power.

Passive – Tailwind
Converting to a localized area (1300 range; equivalent to sight range)
Increased movement speed bonus to 5% from 3%

Q - Howling Gale
Added a .1 AP per second that Howling Gale is charged before release
Ability Power ratio lowered to .35 from .75
Lowered charge damage to 14/20/25/30/35 from 25/30/40/50/60

W – Zephyr
Added an AP ratio to both her passive self-haste and slow amount on the active. These values are .04 for the self-haste and .12 for the slow
Lowered damage ratio to .5 from .6
Lowered base slow to 24%/28%/32%/36%/40% from 24%/30%/36%/42%/48%

E - Eye of the Storm
Added an AP ratio to the AD given to her allies. The ratio is +0.33 AP for the base AD (based off of the rank of her shield)

No one should give a fuck if a black kid dresses up as Hawkeye, and by saying that we should create more options for people who aren't white is like saying ""pay attention to the fact that we have different skin color"" instead of trying to get people tto realize that the color doesn't matter. Superheroes are about morals and beliefs and what's right and wrong, not about their skin.

For 1500. You can still trim the Icons, Chainaxes, Marks and Havok Launchers from the CSM and lose a few Bloodletters in order to have enough points for a Aegis Defense Line w/ Quad Gun if you so please.

As it stands that's 34 models in your army including tanks and stuff. That's kinda low for 1500 points, but from what you've described you wanted to play this is the best I can do.

Abaddon and the Berzerkers ride in the Land Raider. The Land Raider is now your mobile Bastion. 2 heavy bolters, 2 twin-linked Lascannons. The Dirge Caster means that anyone you assault out of the Land Raider within 6"" CANNOT fire Overwatch. Icon of Wrath lets you re-roll charge distance.

2x5 Khorne CSM in Rhinos are to take objectives, go to ground and park that rhino between the enemy and your captured objectives to pop smoke and use as cover.

Your Soul Grinder follows the Land Raider, using its AV14 to block incoming fire while detonating the enemies with his phlegm cannon.

Your Bloodletters and Bloodthirster deep-strike where they're needed to wreck face.

Abaddon and his choo-choo-train of badasses board the Land Raider again and drive off to the next unlucky squad who needs a face-punching.","1383265054"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Nothing is free.  Political groups operate with staff, equipment, overhead, etc. that needs to be financed somehow.  The reason most politicians are well off is not only because of their job, but also because it takes a lot of money to become one in the first place.  Historically, career politicians were very wealthy since donating was not as easy to do and there were also less people with disposable income to donate.  Corporations can ""buy"" politicians by giving them money to buy a ton of ads and get their name out.  People are more likely to vote for a name that they recognize than a random Joe. This is the essence of politics.

There are large restrictions for corporations (arguably removed by Super-PACs but that is a different topic) that restrict the amount to be donated.  There are loopholes, however, but in theory this stops one entity from having too much influence.  This is the difference between donation and bribery.  Since people should be free to spend their money as they please we cannot completely restrict the ability to donate to political causes, but creating a reasonable cap allows for a fair playing field.","1383265056"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Do you not understand how debt works? I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just curious. People drone on and on about U.S. debt (often with no sources) but it's not nearly as bad as it seems. [This video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ugDU2qNcyg) by author and educational YouTuber John Green explains things, but I'll summarize it and use sources while doing so. Please correct me if I make a mistake; I'm not an economist or anything. 

First off, [here is a good source for learning the basics of U.S. debt.] (http://www.gao.gov/special.pubs/longterm/debt/debtbasics.html#govaccounts)

[The debt is about $16.8 trillion.] (http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/10/10/230944425/everyone-the-u-s-government-owes-money-to-in-one-graph) That sounds horrible, right? Well, not really. Trust funds, interest on bonds and the like, and even borrowing from different branches of the federal government (see the video above) account for a whopping $7 trillion of our debt. For example, if government branch A asks branch B for money, they can get it, but it counts as debt, to my knowledge. 

Another $1 trillion is owned by individuals, brokers, corporations, etc. 


About $4 trillion, though really it's more like $4.2 trillion, is owed to mutual funds, private pensions, state and local governments, etc. Bonds make up a decent amount of that chunk. Bonds are debt, but they aren't bad debt. If you help someone buy a house, you give them a huge chunk of money. However, they have to pay it back, and if you're smart, you'll want a little extra because you took a risk. Bonds work similarly. Also, bonds sell very well because they're guaranteed by the U.S. government, which, because of our economic power and reliability on paying debts, is important. 

In total, we owe about $11.2 trillion to domestic people, governments, corporations, etc. of our $16.8 trillion debt. That's about 2/3rds of our debt owned domestically, which is a lot. People mainly fear debt because they fear another country taking over the U.S. or something ridiculous like that. China is the main one, but they own only 8% of our debt, according to the graphic from NPR I linked earlier (1.3/16.8 x 100=7.7%). 

Foreign Debt makes up about $5.6 trillion of U.S. debt, which seems like a lot. However, for every dollar a foreign country owns of our debt, [we own $0.89.] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ugDU2qNcyg&amp;t=1m20s) That means that only $500 billion of our foreign debt hasn't been reciprocated into foreign governments, which is not a lot, especially if you consider the [$15.68 trillion U.S. GDP last year.] (https://encrypted.google.com/#q=u.s.+gdp) 

In summary, the U.S. owes 2/3rds of its debt domestically, and we own a good chunk of foreign debt--barely more than foreigners own of our debt. Furthermore, debt isn't always bad. You may say that the debt is spiraling out of control, but is it, really? The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio is [pretty high] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Federal_Debt_Held_by_the_Public_1790-2013.png), but I'd like to point out a trend in that graph: high debt is followed by economic prosperity, excluding the Civil War. Post-revolution, America had a pretty high debt, but the economy was surprisingly good. We kept our debt very low until the Civil War. World War I resulted in a dramatic increase in debt, but was followed by an economic boom: the Roaring 20s. Granted, they roared until the Great Depression and then World War II, which were horrible and I hope that nothing like either of them ever happens anywhere again. Anyways, this high debt was followed by a period of economic prosperity in the late 40s, 50s, and to an extent the 60s. Our debt increased in the 80s and 90s, which were economically prosperous, and the early 2000s (excluding the Dot Com Bust, but that had very little to do with government) were also great. Then came (drum roll, please) the so-called Great Recession, caused by a combination of lack of regulation on the part of the government and incompetence and avarice on the part of large corporations and wealthy people. Our debt has skyrocketed since then, but based on historical trends, high debt is followed by good economies, assuming that debt doesn't spiral out of control like in the Southern European countries, specifically Greece. Why? High debt is a result of high spending, which insures infrastructure and economic safety. While an economic safety blanket is not as much in place today as it should be, in my opinion, high government spending has a tendency to result in economic confidence and economic prosperity because people can spend more freely with less risk (a sure way to boost the economy). While there are dangers involved with this, people spending more because they feel economically safer is good overall, in my opinion.

**TL;DR: Sorry for the length of this comment, but debt isn't always bad. In most cases, high (but payable) debt results in economic prosperity afterwards.**

Edit: To make the idea that high spending can be good easier to understand, here are some real life examples: 

* College loans seem dangerous in the short term but are highly beneficial in the long term, if you're responsible.

* A loan on a car is similar.

* Mortgages are also comparable.

Edit: Gold? Really? Thanks to whomever gave it to me, but I don't think I deserve it. I just summarized sources and explained debt. If you're going to donate money to anyone, donate it to NPR, PBS, John Green (or his brother Hank Green, which you can do by donating to their [Subbable page for Crash Course] (https://subbable.com/crashcourse)), Wikipedia, or another source I listed. All of those need money to continue to operate, and Wikipedia, NPR, and PBS in particular don't get that much.

"india","t5_2qh1q","This should be the top story on /r/india. If BJP's CM candidate says such things about Sheila Dikshit, _kuchh to baat hai Sheila ji mein_.

Before her, Delhi was a city plagued by communal strife. But in last 15 years, there has not been any serious incidents in Delhi. Hindurashtravadis and Khalistanis have been nipped in the bud. Islamofascists have been hanged like Afzal Guru or killed in encounters like Batla (never mind pseudoseculars like Kejriwal calling it fake).

The infrastructure development has been outstanding. Delhi Metro is not only the best in India, bust also among the best in the world. It remained on paper during the BJP rule, but Sheila Dixit single-handedly turned this dream into a realilty. The city has close to 100 flyovers now, and the Wazirabad bridge will become the largest signature bridge in the world, when completed. And all this world-class infrastructure despite the fact that the central budgetary allocation for Delhi has not increased in last 12 years!

The environmental improvement has been astounding during Sheila Dixit's tenure. Almost around 15% of the city's total area has been brought under the green cover. Another achievement was the introduction of CNG to Delhi despite massive street protests organized by BJP leaders like Mandan Lal Khurana. The conversion of a lakh vehicles to the CNG mode has made Delhi home to the maximum number of vehicles running on green fuel in any city in the world.

People are saying rapes have increased in Delhi - do they realize that it's the reports that have increased - women have more confidence in the administration as the CM is a woman. Not to mention politically incorrect but true fact that in nearly all the cases, the rapists have hailed from non-Congress ruled states like Bihar, Punjab and UP.

Education has improved significantly with six state-level universities commissioned by Delhi government. The percentage of girl's enrollment is among the highest in the country.

Kejriwal is talking about constituency-level politics, as if he came up with this idea. The [Bhagidari scheme](http://www.observerindia.com/cms/export/orfonline/modules/orfpapers/attachments/sheiladikshit_1253532792194.pdf) has been a standing testimony to citizens' participation in the Delhi government at mohalla-level.

AAP and BJP are talking about electricity, but do these critics realize that Delhi used to have 8-10 hours of power cuts 15 years back? The improvement has been remarkable, and the power theft has been greatly reduced. The continuous improvement cycle would stop if Sheila Dixit doesn't get elected again - the new CM will have to start from ground zero.

The economic situaton in the city has never been better. The state has seen a GDP growth of 16.1% last year, leaving behind Maharashtra and Gujarat at #2 and #3 respectively. The per capita income in Delhi (Rs 1,75,812) is among the highest in the country. No other state provides a monthly pension of Rs. 1,500 to the aged, the widows and the physically challenged persons.

And unlike in Gujarat, the development process of Delhi has been inclusive - the Dalits, the minorities, the women and the other weaker sections of the society have not been left out. Delhi Government was the first government to reserve 50 per cent seats in civic bodies in the country.","1383265062"

I always played the way you did, where I tried to max my Friendship with everyone and I would have to look up online what quests to avoid bringing certain companions on because they would disapprove of the choices I would make.

Finally in this last playthrough I just said 'fuck it!' and did it how *I* wanted to do it.  And I made a slightly different character than I usually do (she's a mage who's siding with the Templars and is pretty greedy, and she's romancing Isabela, who she is very similar to - promiscuous and unashamed of it, and always eager to make some money even if it's on sketchy job).

So with this character it was extremely easy to get Friendship with Isabela, Fenris, and Sebastian, who are all my bros and are my regular party.  I always had to work hard with those three to get Friendship, so it was a really nice change.  And for the first time ever I had a Rivalry with Anders and Merrill.  And Anders actually *left my party* in Act 2!!  WTF, I never knew this could happen!  I wonder how it'll affect the dialogue in the end...

The Rivalry with Merrill is pretty good, she's a little less naive, more sharp and stuff.  My character hates her guts, and I *hate* that I can't do more than give her a firm talking to.  I want to be able to yell at her and tell her she's a stupid, naive moron, but I can't, and that makes my Hawke sad :(

So I like both ways.  And I've done a gay mage Rivalmance with Fenris, and I gotta say... wow.  WAY hotter than any other Fenris pairing.  ;)","1383265063"

After removing constants, problem 1 looks like problem 2.  This is the easiest type of problem, and you should be very comfortable doing them.  Applying the **p-series** test will directly tell you the answer.

Edit:  I'm sorry I misread.  For #1, it wants you to find the actual sum.  You need to do a **partial fraction decomposition** and use **telescoping series**.  In general, you can only find explicit sums using either this method, or identifying the series as a **geometric** series.","1383265065"

Which is another part that I left out. I'm heavily involved in shelters -but not with the animals.  I help raise funds, served on the board for years, donate, etc.  But when I meet the animals, I melt.  And I KNOW I can't give them the home they deserve. So I avoid it and hope another kind person rescues them instead.  

But I am exposed to SOO many heart breaking stories, desperate animals, desperate people...  This is why I really thought hard about the possibility of rescuing a SR dog; especially if the toy sizes proved to be as invulnerable to nature-calls as these toy-owners claimed.  (how stressed out are their dogs knowing that they HAVE to pee, but not wanting to mess the rugs?  Every. Single. Day!)

"PS4","t5_2rrlp","As someone who has tried both, honestly I'd say keep the PS4. Xbox One is just... different from the 360. The controller is pretty smaller than the 360 one. Game-wise, multiplats are better built on (and look better) on PS4. Plus, Sony has a history of better exclusives than Microsoft. Though Titanfall looks very cool, a year from now Titanfall 2 will be a multiplat (just like Mass Effect). When I saw the X1, it froze on the load-up screen. Menu-wise, you can go either way. PS4's mic community will pick up now that the console is being bundled with a mic. I believe both online communities will be more vocal than before (though that's not hard for Xbox).

But like you said, you want the superior online gaming console. So far, from what I've seen and heard, that is the Playstation 4. Xbox Live for X1 is having technical issues pre-launch. Will Sony's online be perfect at launch? Probably not, but right now PS4 is your best option. But hey, that's my opinion. You should do what you feel is right for you.","1383265070"

"dayz","t5_2ty3s","&gt;Being honest, DayZ vanilla can be boring as hell.  

DayZ isn't boring, the players are boring.  I've *never* gotten this much sustained fun and intensity out of any other one video game over a period of a year, especially an open sandbox with no objectives.  Easy zombies, easy to find loot, and a huge emphasis on PvP brought hordes of players that were interested in a completely different game than DayZ.  These are the players that get bored with vanilla DayZ.  That being said, it is true that introducing new features and elements keeps a game fresh and keeps the players coming back.  It's my hope that the SA team come up with innovative things to add to the game that preserve the core elements of the game while introducing new things.  I think they can do it.

Dean wants to make an anti-game.  He wants to make something that challenges people and is unforgiving.  While this may go against conventional game developing (and possibly make BI unsettled considering the time and money being invested into SA), there is absolutely no denying the fact that Dean's anti-game was responsible for a significant amount of sales of Arma 2.  Time will tell whether or not Dean and BI stick to their guns and keep DayZ pure or if it will spiral into the distant shadow of DayZ that the mods are now.  

However it goes down, Dean made his mark on video game history.  He set out to make an incredibly challenging game that encourages player driven story, and the world took notice.  I'm happy to have been a part of it.","1383265071"

I wake up around 6am maybe 630 7 days a week, few variations. i sometimes have trouble after DLS in the spring when its darker later in the am, but I generally wake up when the sun comes up or by 630 which ever comes first. this is problematic in winter when DLS kicks back an hour. 

When I wake up. I typically am up. immediately. I need no snooze settings. I'm up and doing shit. putting away dishes, showering, making breakfast, whatever. I often have done a shitload of housework before my wife and son get up on a sunday.

My life has changed and I am now divorced and living with my urgent GF whose room is dark even after sunrise and who always hits snooze for 30 minutes. I stay in bed to honor her routine (she likes snuggling) but if it weren't for that I don't think much would have changed.

As to your question about setting an alarm that forces her to get up, as I said my GF routine is to hit the snooze 5-6X times before actually getting up and about. the alarm is across the room so it forces her to get up, but then she comes back to bed. She needs to get up and cross the room. She only recently switched to putting the alarm right by the bed because its cold in the am. But either way, it 30 minutes before actually getting up.

everyone is different. you won't know unless you try. but I would advise against doing it to motivate her. Do it with her consent and understanding or else you'll just annoy her. it wouldn't be worth it if you ask me.","1383265073"

&gt;Middle English, from Anglo-French persone, from Latin persona actor's mask, character in a play, person, probably from Etruscan phersu mask, from Greek prosōpa, plural of prosōpon face, mask — more at [prosopopoeia.](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/prosopopoeia?show=0&amp;t=1383261232) 
First Known Use: 13th century

(...[and originated from theological debates about the relation of God and the Word, and was later extended to the Holy Spirit, angels, and human beings in general.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person)) Normally I'd be wary of etymology in arguments, but in this case, it turns out to be rather interesting. The notion of ""person"" so popular in the West today, even among atheists, originated from Christian borrowing of Greek/Roman theatrical vocabulary during theological disputes.

I'm saying that from a multi-partite perspective, the personality is one part of a whole that you do not believe exists. Instead, from this perspective, you're taking a part to be the whole. 

&gt;Raise a copy of the the same person in two different environments and you get two distinctly different personalities.

Before my Vybe post yesterday that got 700+ upvotes, I was not at all asked by the project creators to post to Reddit. I just posted, and it organically took off. 

Thank you for hearing me out here, and I really hope to dispel the notion that there's some sort of trickery going on with my posts. I am not personally affiliated with the Vybe project in any way, aside from providing support as they launched their crowdfunding campaign. ","1383265075"

"graffhelp","t5_2u4ca","Yo! That is pretty cool! Simple, blocky, consistent spacing, with some small elements of style! I see potential for a more pronounced connection between the K and the L, or the L and the U, or even the L and the E.
The back stroke of the K is a bit larger than the rest, you could either bring it back into line with the rest of the letters or make it bigger and kick some arrows of the back to make it the feature of the piece. The small tab on the back of the K sits a lot higher than the the one at the front, which is synced with the bottom of the L and E. You might want to fix that on the next go around. 

I would like to see you repeat that outline a few times, but address the points I've made here, and also use that formula as a framework to play with one or two of the letters each time. For example, keep everything the same but try to funk out the E a bit. Or keep everything the same but scale the U down a little and sit it on top of a connection between the bottom of the L and E. 

The next boot camp session will be on shadow and 3D. So I got you covered there.

"russia","t5_2qh75","&gt; The USSR didn't fight Nazism as much as is fought Germany for invading them (which simply happened to be Nazi). 

Eh, you could pretty much say that about the rest of the countries. No other countries were tripping over themselves to go fight Nazism in Germany. In fact, Germany violated the Treaty of Versailles in March 1936, annexed Austria in March 1938, occupied Czechoslovakia in March 1939, and only after it invaded Poland in September 1939 did UK and France declare war (with a whole bunch of countries declaring neutrality form the get go)... They were eventually forced into war because their allies were being invaded/ they were being threatened with eventual invasion if they didn't stop Hitler then. Who is to say that if Germany stayed put and quietly carried on with killing of Jews/ Gypsies etc. that anybody would have bothered invading them? Nobody stopped the killing fields in Cambodia, or the Rwandan genocide..

But yea, you are right, USSR definitely used that time to try to also occupy many countries to further communism. Twas only after Hitler stepped on their toes that they decided to fight back. It was hardly some higher sense of morality that drove USSR to war.. And boy I'm glad no more countries fell to the USSR, enough ended up being screwed over in many ways under that particular communist regime. Which leads to your next point:

&gt; is this wrong cancelled out because they happened to win a war they were unwillingly dragged into?

Um, why do you feel the need to divide all of history into right and wrong? And this whole thing with the balance, whether things cancel each other out or not. Do you really think this is a good, constructive and reflective of reality way of looking at history? Do you really see history as giant scales, with all the events balances on it, and if the scale tips slightly to one side all the history is declared good or bad?

Also, if we are talking about cancelling things out, why concentrate on WW2? Again to bring up the whole colonisation and exploitation and abuse of many countries and their natives, is that cancelled out by UK, Spain, France and USA fighting in WW2? Why do you feel compelled to argue this particular time in history, and only based on the worst things a country did during that time?



Look, you are obviously the master of your historical scales, and can declare countries as good/ bad as you wish. But I think it's a terrible way of looking at history. Somewhere you said that it was good when countries learned from their mistakes. Well, I think it's very counter productive to say that a country was overall on the right/ wrong side, because it neglects the negative/ positive parts that were present in their histories, which should be remembered. It should be remembered that UK, France and USA did some pretty terrible things during WW2, even if their cause was to fight a terrible regime. It is good to remember that Germany and USSR did accomplish some great things, even if their regimes were responsible for some of the worst humanitarian disasters in the last century. 

It's not that I don't agree with you that some parts could have turned out better/ different. But I don't agree with you simplifying it down *so much*.

At that price, you can probably get a decent rear wheel with a flip-flop hub pre-built.  If you're current rim's high quality it might be worth it to spring for the hub and the swap, but if you're on a mediocre rim, you might as well upgrade the whole thing if you're spending the money anyway.

So to keep the farce going, the tubes find ways of making new
tubes, which also put things in at one end and let them out at the other. At the input end they even develop ganglia of nerves called brains, with eyes and ears, so that they can more easily scrounge around for things to swallow. As and when they get enough to eat, they use up their surplus energy by wiggling in complicated patterns, making all sorts of noises by blowing air in and out of the input hole, and gathering together in groups to fight with other groups. In time, the tubes grow such an
abundance of attached appliances that they are hardly recognizable as mere tubes, and they manage to do this in a staggering variety of forms. There is a vague rule not to eat tubes of your own form, but in general there is serious competition as to who is going to be the top type of tube. All this seems marvelously futile, and yet, when you begin to think about it, it begins to be more marvelous than futile. Indeed, it seems extremely odd.”

My tumor is right by my speech center, and the rad oncologist is confident I would lose my ability to speak. They'd intend to send me to intensive therapy, possibly of a similar format. I got to experience losing my ability to speak prior, in the immediate period post surgery. Swelling impaired bloodflow to my speech center, which worked immediately after surgery, then shut down function for about 4-5 days. Towards the end I could turn on and off my ability to speak with an ice pack.

The provincial nature of the opinion isn't helped by federal level programs which are perceived and often are ponderous and wasteful by nature.  Concepts that lends themselves naturally to local social structures are removed to larger beaurocracy largely because of the same proliferation of provincial attitudes at state/local levels.

"gis","t5_2qmpb","What are you trying to do exactly? Why are you transforming it?

In a nutshell, Warp will reproject from a source spatial reference system (SRS) to a target SRS. Do you have a source SRS?

If you really want to make a GIS map, do it all in QGIS. Why? Well a GIS stores all your things as either vectors (points, lines, polygons) or rasters (an array of values, like a photo). A simpel map of the world might have LAND, WATER polygons, RIVERS, ROADS as lines, TOWNS as points etc. Make a layer for all of those, make it a certain vector type. For bonus points, do it in PostGIS or SQLite so that you have a database to play with.

Each of the layers above needs a CRS, in order to know where it is on the earth's surface. But what lots of people who don't care about such things as the rest of the world (like engineers or architects) do is just make an arbitrary coordinate system. If I were you, I'd just use 1000,1000 as a 0 point and make your maps there.

If you really do want to make a map in photoshop, then why not use a zoomify method like this: http://blog.thematicmapping.org/2013/06/showing-zoomify-images-with-leaflet.html","1383265094"

1) Why would the Pacers take on contracts?  In case they hadn't noticed, we are pushing the luxury tax, which the Pacers are treating as a hard cap.  We need to re-sign Stephenson this off-season, and adding more pieces would essentially end that hope.

2) Granger has more value here.  I can't think of all the teams trying to cut cap, but at the trade deadline that is much less likely than in the off-season.  Granger won't have a lot of trade value, and the Pacers won't want anything they can get in return.

3) If Granger can get to at least 75%, he is going to be a huge part of the team.  Instead of adding more players who aren't familiar with the system, we get someone who has played for Vogel for a while.  That's a big advantage.","1383265098"

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","As a US citizen you will be required to file your US tax return and report all of your income every year. This includes both earned income (salaries, etc.) and passive investment income (interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.). 

It is important to note that the country you are living in may also tax your worldwide income as well. This varies country to country and depends on their specific tax legislation. Canada for example taxes you on your worldwide income if you are considered a resident of Canada for the year (citizenship is not important). 

However, most Americans living abroad end up in higher tax jurisdictions and pay more tax to their host country than they would in the States. As some other people mentioned here there is really no effect on your total taxes in these situations. This is because of foreign tax credit regimes that wipe out taxes. Basically the United States will not tax you again on any income that you have already paid tax on. Even when tax was paid to another country. The concept of ""sourcing"" also comes into play here as well. Countries have agreements in place on who has the first right to tax income based on where it was earned, where the taxpayer lives, etc. This changes which country gives you the credit and which country collects the tax. Their are some general rules that the United States follows for sourcing, but the tax treaty in place between the countries in question can result in different treatment.

The Wikipedia article on foreign tax credits provides a good breakdown of the general sourcing rules for the US: [US Sourcing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_tax_credit#U.S._approach)

TL;DR - Yes the country you are living in may require you to file a tax return and pay taxes. However, you will not end up in a situation where you are getting taxed twice by two different countries on the same income.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","[[Copy from here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/askmenblog/comments/1ljv4g/eight_of_the_biggest_mens_issues_in_the_western/)]

The attention given to men's issues by the modern discourse on gender issues is abysmal, leading many people to think that there's really nothing wrong with the status or treatment of men, which is simply not the case. What's worse is that for many (or even all) of them, if the genders were switched and they affected women they would be seen as major gender issues.

**The health gap**. In countries such as Canada, Australia, the UK, and the US, for example, women live 4-5 years longer than men do, and women's health issues receive much more attention and funding. It's certainly possible that biology contributes to the difference in life expectancy, but it's hard to argue that the differences in priorities and attention don't also have an effect ([especially when the gap used to be closer to one year than to five](http://www.efmoody.com/images/12lifeexpectancy.gif)):

&gt; The health of British men is so bad that each year 20,000 more of them die before the age of 65 than women. They are more likely to suffer heart disease, cancer and HIV. Men aged 20 to 24 are three times more likely to die than young women. … The excess of premature male deaths is the equivalent of a jumbo jet full of men crashing each week. … There is eight times as much money spent on specific female health issues as on male ones. [from the Guardian article ""[Men's health shock](http://www.theguardian.com/society/2001/jan/08/health)""]

&gt; There are at least 7 new agencies and departments devoted solely to women while there is not one office for men or male specific ailments. Men’s health advocates long have pushed for an Office of Men’s Health to act as a companion to the Office on Women’s Health, established in 1991. Instead of rectifying that disparity, the new health care law intensified it. [from the Daily Caller article ""[Does Obamacare discriminate against men?](http://dailycaller.com/2010/12/10/does-obamacare-discriminate-against-men/)""]

**The education gap**. A major women's issue in the past was that they were undereducated. Many people still believe this to be the case, [but it's actually much closer to the reverse](http://warrenfarrell.name/dev/resources/degrees.png). Women make up a noticeable majority of university students, and in most other levels of education boys and men are faring worse too:

&gt; Data from the U.S. Department of Education and from several recent university studies show that far from being shy and demoralized, today's girls outshine boys. They get better grades. They have higher educational aspirations. They follow more-rigorous academic programs and participate in advanced-placement classes at higher rates. [from the Atlantic article ""[The War Against Boys](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/)"" by Christina Hoff Sommers]

**Harsher treatment in the justice system**. The racial biases of justice systems are well known—in the United States, for example, simply being black results in harsher sentencing (even taking into account the context, i.e. demographic and criminological factors), but what's not widely known is that [being a man has the same effect](http://www.terry.uga.edu/~mustard/sentencing.pdf). Sexist treatment is even more pronounced in cases of sexual assault, rape, and domestic violence, where men are rarely accepted as the victim and usually assumed to be the perpetrator:

&gt; Under the predominant aggressor doctrine, when police officers respond to a domestic disturbance call, they are instructed not to focus on who attacked whom and who inflicted the injuries, but instead consider different factors which will almost always weigh against men. These factors include: comparable size; comparable strength; the person allegedly least likely to be afraid; who has access to or control of family resources (i.e., who makes more money); and others. Given these factors, it is very difficult for officers to arrest female offenders. [from the Washington Times article ""[NOW's complaint over Tebow ad heard loud and clear in police departments](http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/watercooler/2010/feb/09/nows-complaint-over-tebow-ad-heard-loud-and-clear-/)""]

**Social support**. There's a huge difference in how we treat men and women who are down in life. When men are down in life we're likely to dismiss them as failures and not care, while when women are down we're likely to see them as victims, be sympathetic, and support them. This applies to general cultural attitudes as well as government social programs, [which disproportionately target women](http://www.cultural-misandry.com/female-only-programs/). It's really not surprising that men turn to alcohol/drugs and even [commit suicide much more frequently](http://1.usa.gov/obHPN6):

&gt; Approximately 70 per cent of Canada’s homeless are male. Dion Oxford of Toronto’s Salvation Army Gateway shelter for men tells us it is harder to raise funds for men’s shelters. “Single, middle-aged homeless men are simply not sexy for the funder,” he says. [from the Globe and Mail article ""[Should universities be opening men’s centres?](http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/giving/should-universities-be-opening-mens-centres/article4436249/)""]

**Devaluation of fathers**. It's often said that ""being a mother is the hardest job in the world"". Fathers are often treated (both by society but especially by family courts) as if their only worth to their child is a source of money even though [the absence of a father makes a child significantly more likely to use drugs, turn to crime, and drop out of school, among other things](http://www.fatherhood.org/media/fatherhood-statistics).

**Demonisation of male sexuality**. We're quick to label a man flirting with a woman as ""harassment"", a man expressing sexual desire for a woman as ""objectifying her"", and a man who's awkward or unattractive as ""creepy"". It's wrong to ""sexualise"" women, we're told. Men are made to feel as if their sexuality is unwanted and a burden, and that any expression of it is a sign of disrespect that must be made up for. This has a horrendous effect on many men's ability to properly express interest and find love and intimacy.

**Lack of self-respect and self-worth**. Men see messages everywhere of how they should respect women, but they hear stunningly little about how they deserve respect from themselves and from women too. This results in an unhealthy reverence towards women and a self-depreciating attitude that makes many of them less able to stand up for themselves and avoid being taken advantage of (which we prioritize teaching women to avoid).

**Reproductive rights**. If a woman doesn't feel she's ready for the responsibilities of parenthood, she has various options after sex (at least in most of the western world) like the morning-after pill, abortion, adoption, and safe haven laws. Men have no comparable rights or options.

&gt; Women’s rights advocates have long struggled for motherhood to be a voluntary condition, and not one imposed by nature or culture. … If a man accidentally conceives a child with a woman, and does not want to raise the child with her, what are his choices? Surprisingly, he has few options in the United States. … Do men now have less reproductive autonomy than women? Should men have more control over when and how they become parents, as many women now do?

Thanks (fat) dad.  

If I don't eat healthy foods in managed quantities and exercise regularly I balloon.  At the same time, if I do eat healthy food in managed quantities and exercise regularly I can shed weight quickly.  The weight that I like to be is about 125 (at my height of 5'4""), which represents eating about 1700 calories a day and exercising about five or six hours per week.  However, it's really, really, really not about the number on the scale to me.  I care a lot more about my size, and since I weight train a fair bit (for a girl!) I can pack a fair amount of weight onto a small frame.  Right now I'm about 135 and I can comfortably wear size two pants from The Gap.  I'd like to get back into my zeroes, though, which means cutting calories down to about 1500 for a month or two.

So somebody bringing food into a restaurant that is for public consumption (ie. a table of diners) that hasn't originated from a trusted source is a potential for a restaurant to lose their license. 

Now the customer themselves is not breaking any law in doing this but if the establishment say ""You can't do that"" or ""please leave"" then I believe that you have to because you are on their private property. It's more of a legal issue for the restaurant but I think that was what the matradee was trying to highlight when he said ""You can't by law...""","1383265112"

In addition, I don't think we have any evidence against the idea that law does not do anything to reduce violent crime rates.

There is a reason all these things are already paid for by taxes - because they are beneficial to society when the coverage is mandatory.  People who don't have health insurance clog up the ER, and then can't pay. Hospitals pass that bill on to everyone else.

For whatever reason people (from both sides) seem to be completely incapable of having a genuine discussion about politics. How often have comments like that changed someone's opinion? Never. If anything the person will become even more entrenched in their beliefs. (I actually believe there was a study that came to this conclusion, but I can't find it right now.) Even in college where people are supposedly more open minded political discussions have a way of devolving into name calling. If you want to change someone's mind talk to them.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Their greatest fear was that the national government would become too strong. Saying the government has become ""too"" strong is necessarily a subjective opinion, but it cannot be denied that the powers of the national government have grown far beyond what even a strong federalist like Alexander Hamilton might have imagined. 

Quite ironically, the anti-Federalists' one major achievement—the Bill of Rights, which you acknowledge—probably worked against their cause more than anything else since the ratification of the constitution. As imagined and understood by the framers, the constitution granted only certain enumerated powers (mainly the ones given to Congress in Article 1 Section 9) to the national government. The Federalists were concerned that a Bill of Rights would undermine this notion; why do we need to explicitly prohibit the establishment of a religion, for example, when Article 1 Section 9 does not grant that power to Congress in the first place? Why would we have to protect people's right to bear arms when the constitution never said the government could take away people's arms?

Well, the Federalists ended up being right: nowadays, we have a few rights floating in a sea of government power, instead of a few government powers floating in a sea of rights. Basically, the Supreme Court has allowed the government to justify virtually any new power it assumes under the Commerce Clause, and the only real checks against government power are the few rights explicitly enumerated in the amendments. 

So, while the anti-Federalists seem to have achieved the opposite of their intention with the Bill of Rights, the fear that spurred the enumeration of those rights—the fear that the national government would grow like a cancer until it has its thumbs in everyone's pies—was well-founded. 

I guess my point is that I probably can't convince you whether you should agree with the anti-Federalists or not. That will depend entirely on whether you think a powerful national government is a good thing or not. But you certainly can't deny that their fears came true. States' rights have been diminished greatly. Federal power is virtually unlimited. The executive, in particular, has grown in power, with executive orders increasing hugely over time. Perhaps most startlingly, the legislature has basically completely abdicated its duty to administer the powers of war; the president sends troops in and out of foreign countries without approval or a formal declaration of war from Congress. 

So, maybe their arguments weren't strong, and maybe their distrust of a large federal government was unfounded, but their suspicion that the federal government would grow and grow turned out to be exactly right. ","1383265129"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; So, is there aBigBangus like there is abiogenesis? I thought the Big Bang was how the universe began, not the expansion post-Big Bang.

Abiogenesis means the formation of life from non-life. The Big Bang *is* the expansion of the universe, and it seems we absolutely can't see anything before 10^-43 seconds after the singularity. We do know what happened at 10^-37 seconds, though.

&gt; To me, the Big Bang is: nothing followed by great expansion. This isn't my view. I deny the ""nothing"" but I accept the great expansion (based on evidence).

Good news: you don't have a problem with the Big Bang. This ""nothing"" is more for the religious. The Big Bang starts with a singularity.

&gt; Yes the universe now is accelerating but who is to say the life of the universe is 20 billion years? What if the life of the universe is a trillion years, after which it starts to shrink.

You'd have to propose some other mechanism of slowing it, because gravity is clearly not doing a good enough job at the moment, and it will only get less and less effective as things get farther away from each other.

I used to like the idea of a cyclic universe, too. It seemed elegant. But science marches on, and that's not supported by the evidence.","1383265131"

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","I agree with you in some ways and disagree in others. It's confusing watching WG try to balance the game.

They manage to fit in an entire line of OP tanks, but they care just enough about balance to separate the KV-1S into the KV-85 and KV-122.

Likewise, I've never understood how premium tanks can simply be removed from the store without actually balancing them. Of course, the Type 59 and KV-5 aren't as OP as they used to be, but balancing a game by just trying to reduce the number of players with said tank is just a very strange way to go about it.

Honestly I don't see this game really surviving past another year at most. War Thunder's tanks will either be released or be in some form of beta, and by then the power creep in WoT will be so bad that every nation will just be full of auto-loaders that some guy at WG invented and clan wars will be an absolute travesty.","1383265132"

That's what's offensive.

Not everyone who colors their skin darker to portray a specific person with dark skin actually thinks that wearing darker skin emulates all of Blackness.  I am pretty sure they are just trying to imitate what the person actually looks like, not the entirety of their blackness, just what they look like.  Trying to emulate the entirety of blackness was what minstrel shows did, but that's not necessarily what people do now.

Try to blame every single loss on yourself, even if you crushed your lane and never died.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","When dealing with a large scale war or invasion type scenario, I like to use story over combat rules. Make a few plot points that will turn the battle either way and have the characters around to influence the events.

Did they find the spy? Did they ambush the advance scouts? Did they stop the saboteur from polluting the water supply? Did they capture a general on his way to meet the troops? It could be any number of things.

I like to do it in a way where the characters don't always find out the importance until later. Like maybe they get in a bar fight, and everyone in the tavern gets thrown in the brig, turns out one of the people in the tavern was a spy, and he didn't get to deliver his repot. 

Maybe they are hired to protect a traveling merchant and they arrive in a village that has been sacked by the advancing army. What do they do with this information? Can they get the merchant (and themselves) back to safety, and get the information to the right people (we saw an army on the move over by &lt;village name&gt;...)

Then later as one army gets the upper hand (either because their spy got through or it didn't) change events accordingly. 

Also, I like to have the characters learn that they caused this shift as the story progresses (maybe they meet the spy again and he thanks them for the help, if they helped him. Or maybe the spy is now an enemy because they stopped him.)

I don't usually have them fight an army directly.","1383265141"

Multivitamins will take care of those deficiencies and make you feel SO much better. In terms of weight:benefit ratio, multivitamins, peanut butter and water are your 3 best friends, in my opinion.

Morning: Bananas/fruit, peanut butter,  eggs, oatmeal

Lunch: Granola bars, chicken breasts(in salad, by itself, be creative), veggies, nuts/trail mix, some more peanut butter/bananas

Dinner: Chicken (of course), tons of veggies (spinach, asparagus, green beans, etc) and maybe a little protein powder to help you recover.

Snacks every couple hours will keep your metabolism active (along with your constant water). I'd have a banana with peanut butter pretty much whenever I wanted, since it only weighs maybe .3 and will make you feel WAY better.

No, but they placed bombers with nukes in west Berlin, and we know that this decision influenced the Soviets.

&gt; The point of my questions was to demonstrate you cannot give evidence of how history didn't happen. You can give an explanation of how it would happen were it not for particular choices.

But you haven't even demonstrated that. You haven't demonstrated a single instance of Israel changing any decision regarding the Palestinian conflict as a result of an Iranian action. I can easily show you multiple examples of Israel ""not doing"" something due to US or Soviet pressure, which means it is possible to give evidence of something that was planned, but didn't happen.

You are vastly overestimating Iranian influence on the Israelis with regards to decision making on the Palestinian issue.

You are similarly vastly overestimating the influence of a fringe Israeli movement (which doesn't even exist anymore) on Israeli politics.

In both cases you simply make absolutely wild claims with no sources to back them up, and simply claim ""original research"". Unless you provide sources to back your claims, you can claim the most ridiculous things you want, and that isn't how intelligent debates work.","1383265145"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;I have yet to have a discussion with a libertarian redditor about fiscal policy that lasts longer than 3 questions.

That's interesting.  Let's see if we can figure out why.

&gt;This subreddit is also infested with people who hate common sense, 

oooh.  Common sense is a dirty term.  That's pretty much the catchall explanation for ""I can't logically support my stance, but you have to agree with me, IT'S COMMON SENSE!""


So... that might be problem 1.  If you tried to appeal to 'common sense'  I'd down-vote you too.  That's not a useful line in a genuine discussion.

&gt;People hate liberatarianism because the majority of libertarians fancy themselves to be sooo enlightened

I'm pretty sure you can swap out ""libertarianism"" in that sentence for just about any other ism you can think of, and it will still be true.

Probably more to the point, who is complaining about people hating libertarianism?  Are you responding to my second edit?  I'm going to assume so.  I wasn't complaining that people don't like my beliefs.  In fact, I specifically welcomed the discussion and debate that following.  I was asking for a justification for downvotes, which are not a disagree button, but CLEARLY get used that way.  This is annoying in general, but downright fucking perverse that it gets used to just reflexively downvote any pro-libertarian posts in a libertarian subreddit.  

No need to try to get all macro, I was talking about this specific pattern of behavior.

&gt;then their answer to everything based in the real world is the knee-jerk ""LESS GOVERNMENT"".

Your tendency to generalize is getting annoying.

&gt;If your ""most important beliefs"" are smoking cigarettes/weed, drinking, and shooting guns...then its no wonder why the U.S. is so fucked right now &amp; people are increasingly viewing libertarianism as a joke

Well that describes exactly 0 of the libertarians I know.  maybe that's because I'm 30 years old, but I kinda doubt it.  

I'm starting to get a feel for why someone might not want to have a long conversation with you.  You're coming off as a bit of a douche.
Let's keep going though.

&gt;The government has laws to prevent OTHER PEOPLE from getting drunk &amp; killing you in a car wreck...and laws to prevent OTHER PEOPLE from shooting you, or feel endangered by your own gun....and laws to prevent OTHER PEOPLE from breathing in your 2nd-hand smoke...

ok...... I mean, no shit?  I don't know what else you want me to say?  This isn't news to anyone.  Literally, everyone who's old enough to know these words knows that this is the purpose of these laws.  I'm sure the folks over at /r/conspiracy would argue differently, but even they would agree that safety and prevention is the justification for them.

Of course, this does not at all address whether those laws are efficacious, necessary, useful, or worth the associated costs involved.


&gt;Fairly elementary stuff...

oh and there it is.

Full on douche-mode.




If no one will have a conversation with you, maybe the problem isn't everyone else....

But weigh that against the possibility of your reboot taking even longer because you didn't give yourself a clean break. Your brain needs to re-wire. You have to give it some breathing room. 

* You might not need to go a full 90Days in ""Hard Mode"", but I would suggest at least 2-4 weeks of total shut-down and see how it goes. In the long-run it's not a big sacrifice, and remember, it's for a good cause!

There are so many crimes you can commit though, it's hard to just make a sweeping and broad generalization to categorize them all without immediately thinking of exceptions.

Anyway, my concern are the few (or many?) who are not pure evil who are truly just trying to good in the way they know how. The ones who would me more susceptible (is that the best word?) to rehab. And I don't mean this just in the realm of sex offenders but any crime.

The problem with sentences beyond 5 years is that is ruins your life. Your relationships are gone and at that point you become pretty institutionalized - used to relying on a system for everything. You forget how to operate in the real world much less how to implement changes to yourself in it on top of having a really, really big disadvantage by way of your rap sheet.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, actually that's a fairly interesting story as well...he told the complex that he'd changed the door lock to prevent his ex from getting back in. He gave them one of the master keys and they said that was OK.

Skipping forward to when he went to switch apartments (I have a truck so I helped him move; they had raised rent and he said nope). We got all of his crap packed (of course he didn't do it) and we were told by the complex that we had to be out by 2 pm...no big. By noon we had all of his stuff safely in the new apartment. He realized that he had forgotten a trash can in his old apartment...it was the last thing I guess. We decided we'd unpack a bit then go back for it, I was kinda just along for the ride at this point since I was staying at his apartment that night. 

Once we get back there's this cable guy standing outside standing near his door (but the cable guy was on ground level at the time) SCREAMING into his phone...went something like this:

THE ASSHOLE LOCKED HIS DOOR AND CHANGED IT! THE KEY YOU GAVE ME DOESN'T WORK!!!

We kinda edged closer and asked the guy what's up?

To which we got glared at and he responded:

I'm supposed to already be at a different job but these assholes can't get their shit together. Apparently the last guy who lived here changed his locks without telling the complex.

We realized he was talking about us...

STSF grabs his phone out of his pocket and starts talking on it all of a sudden:

STSF - ""What? We'll be right there."" Ashley's been in a wreck, she's OK but we gotta go.

Me - OK.

We get in my truck...he says ""Yeah I don't need that trash can.""

We don't know an Ashley.

TL;DR: Apartment complex didn't give the cable guy the right key to old apartment...buddy lost a trash can over it.","1383265163"
"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","I honestly didn't see it as negatively as you saw it.  Let me go through and respond to your points how I saw them.

&gt;hacking

The present tense is meant to be understood as being true at that time period.  They are subject to hacking and were stolen, to say anything else is dishonest.  The first instances of theft are important.  Not just because they could be stolen, but also that they were worth stealing.

&gt;silk road

The price of a bitcoin isn't mentioned *anywhere*, except when discussing the large bubble (and indirectly in the purchase of a pizza).

&gt;ponzi

Speaking of the pizza, it is not explicitly stated there either why the time point is a milestone.  In every entry, good and bad, it's left for the reader to infer why it was important.  It's abridged, after all.

&gt;atm final words

You could also interpret this entry that the ATM complies with regulations and laws of its home country.  I mean, if you just include one extra word there it becomes ""curb money laundering and other fraud.""

The article is sorely lacking in any mention of merchants and organizations using the currency legitimately, which is a huge misstep but also difficult to sum up in one entry in the past.  But beyond that, it's not negative.  It just doesn't go apeshit with praise and call it things like ""disruptive wave of the future.""  Even though the second sentence calls it a breakthrough in transactions.

It's not meant to be positive either, or negative.  It's the story of bitcoin still growing despite anything negative, and the major positive things that have happened to push that forward.","1383265163"

Comcast basically told me that they are going to give me 300GB of internet for the month starting Nov. 1st. they also stated that the ""typical user"" doesn't use near that much! Who doesn't use near that much? People that only refresh Facebook with their internet? They also said that if I needed more than 300GB I shouldn't worry because for the small nominal fee of $10 they will add 50GB blocks of data automatically for $10 each. 

Oh well fucking awesome Comcast. Thanks for treating me like a child and telling me exactly what I need. I don't pay you guys to think. I pay you guys for fucking internet and cable. I feel like they are going backwards, this is the bullshit people initially dealt with during the flip-phone era when data was given in blocks and additional charges were added when you went over your limit. 

I'm pretty pissed but thanks to the fact Comcast is a monopoly I get to either take it up the ass or take it up the ass.

I guess I'll pick the second option?

"lightingdesign","t5_2rfak","To piggy back off this, LEDs have a notoriously bad color rendering index. I'm basic terms, this means that colors (and particularly skin) will look funky when lit with only LEDs. This is because they only output extremely narrow wavelengths of light as opposed to broadband output of tungsten lights. The expensive LED fixtures combat this by adding more wavelengths, like the ETC X7 system. They have a much better CRI, close to tungsten, but are expensive.

If I were you, I'd keep your front lights as tungsten for a natural look, and go with LEDs for your accents like sides, backs, or tops.","1383265169"

By the way, not to take anything from your dad, but here's my boots: http://i.imgur.com/QRDjMFS.jpg. They costed me about 25 Euro, and that's a fucking lifehack if I ever seen one: these are heavy-duty boots for worker men, they will serve me for five years at the least no matter what I do with them (the previous pair started to disintegrate after that time, but they were cheaper, too). They have a steel filling just in case, and that rubber coating on top of it (so they aren't getting scratched), and they are sort of stylish actually, like, Grunge or something. And they felt nice to my feet right from the start.

I'd maybe also say drop Hero's Reunion, just because static one-for gain life effects aren't too beneficial.

If you happen to have any Hopeful Eidolon (may have butchered that name, the 1/1 lifelinker bestow creature from Theros) I'd say find a way to work a few of those in. Maybe drop Voracious worm for it, just because with the Eidolon you can say you WILL gain life instead of depending on gaining life for a good creature?

Ethereal Armor would be a good card in this deck, if there's one thing I despise more than my opponent gaining life, it's him gaining life off of creatures I don't wanna block. Plus if you wound up putting the Eidolon out turn 1 and then turn 2 put an Ethereal Armor on him, he's a 3/3 first strike lifelink. That's pretty scary I think.

I think she's kind of talking through her hat when she denies that Mother Jones isn't a little leftward ""inflected,"" but the site's still pretty high quality work and it seems not be engaging in anything so egregious or blatant to warrant a sitewide ban.

But when users start slapping sensationalist titles on your work when they post it to r/politics, more often than not the sensationalism gets attributed to your site instead of the OP. 

So if you're a media website, the question is: how do you encourage readers to share your links but discourage them from adding too much personal flair to the presentation? On Facebook or Twitter, it's less of an issue because the user is the most prominent aspect of the posts or tweets. On reddit, the title and the domain are the more prominent aspects.","1383265180"

Studies are mixed about whether this is true or not, but ultimately trying to quantitatively measure an individual's ""realistic perception"" is difficult, and attempts to do so rely on various different operating assumptions.  It tends to be easier to measure one's self-perception, and so a number of studies have focused on that.  One issue that they run up against is the natural tendency for people to inflate their own importance and abilities.  Depression and pessimism could correct this tendency, or it might simply replace one set of inaccurate ideas with another set.  The studies are split on this as well. ","1383265181"

Pension funds are like, by far the largest holders of US equity in the world. 

In fact, the largest investment portfolio in the world is held by GPIF, with a whopping $1.3 trillion in pensions. According to [Towers Watson, 
](http://www.towerswatson.com/en-AU/Insights/IC-Types/Survey-Research-Results/2013/09/The-worlds-300-largest-pension-funds-year-end-2012), you've got CALPERS, at $220 billion, CalSTRS, at $160 billion, New York State Pensions at $150 billion, New York City Retirement at $132 billlion, the General Motors Pension funr at $120 billion, Texas Teachers at $110 billion, and so on. 

By contrast, the largest hedge fund in the world (which also manages money for many of these pension funds), manages less than $80 billion.

These aren't small institutions, and guess what, they all use HFT algos in their trade execution because that's the only way you can buy shares in quantities without getting your face ripped off.

This isn't mom and pop retirement saver buying a few hundred dollars a month in index funds. These are extremely large institutions dealing with massive notionals. At that size you can't just get onto your E Trade account and place market orders.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","There was a money dispute following MRN's relegation from LCS between Marn, Megazero, and 1 or 2 other members of MRN, I can't remember exactly. Megazero complained about Marn on reddit and made a huge deal out of getting boned by him without actually giving any specific details. So Marn put up a blog post explaining his side and gave very specific details. Basically he said that the team had agreed at the beginning of the season that Marn would pay for their house out of their paychecks from Riot, and at the end of the season some of the members were like ""wtf where the rest of my money"" and Marn was like ""you guys trashed the house and lost the entire security deposit..."" Mega never responded so it's basically a matter of who you want to believe but since Mega never gave any specific details about his side while Marn did, I think most people are more inclined to believe Marn. That's not to say Marn didn't fuck up the situation as well, but Mega came off as a spoiled, passive aggressive child.

The Marine stumbled out of the portal and collapsed against the floor, his hands grimy with the blood of the demons he'd slaughtered by the masses to get here. Rolling onto his back, the man attempted to catch his breath, the shotgun in his grasp slipping from bloodied fingers. 

The man opened his bruised eyes and caught the view of a blue sky for the first time in what felt like an eternity. The man laughed out loud with relief and slapped his hands against the ground. 

""I DID IT!"" He screamed, slowly sitting up. ""I DID IT!"" He screamed again, pumping his fists into the air. ""I -"" He looked away from the sky, catching a glimpse of the crushed and burning skyline of 2145 Dallas in the distance.

The man just sat there, frozen in shock. From one of the nearby burning buildings, a faun-like creature with curved horns stepped free from the rubble and focused hateful goatlike eyes on the soldier. 

The soldier screamed in frustration, breaking off from the ground into a sprint at the beast. The demon dug inch-long claws into his skin- But it wasn't able to stop the top of it's head being blown away by shotgun slugs.

Still screaming in anger and frustration, the soldier loaded his shotgun once more, pumping two rounds into the creature's now twitching chest. 

""Fuck! FUCK YOU! FUCK YOU!"" He ranted, before smashing the butt of the weapon into what was left of the demon's skull until all that was left was a smear with the consistency of chili. ""Fuck all of you demon mother fuckers! You invade my home?! I'm going to invade yours!""","1383265191"

There's actually a fairly equal amount of people who play video games in one form or another. It's the type of game and gaming habits themselves that are gendered.

AAA shooters will always be considered guy things simply because guys spend their money on them, while dance central, tetris and farmville are more girl oriented games... they like quick puzzle stuff to pass the time rather than games where you spend hours to get another gun. Just another example of people mistaking gender difference for social factors.

You don't have to agree with me, you can think whatever you want because this is my last comment here;

Guys tend to work with things, girls tend to work with people. I realize there's exceptions and you may yet again perceive this simple observation for a ""stereotype"", but it's something you might come to understand as you get older and see more of the world.

Now there won't be wholesale profits, but if I were to charge 13-15$ a draft, include a bottomless beverage, and provide and environment where players can relax, enjoy a meal if needed, and just chat and live magic the way it was meant to be chatted and lived, I don't know where the plan could go wrong. Maybe it's too good a plan. That might be my worst case scenario, being too cool an idea..","1383265192"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Girl here. I'm in a very similar situation to you and your girlfriend--my boyfriend and I have been together a little longer, but over the last six months or so I've had a lot of problems getting off. We used to be incredibly passionate, but over time that falls off (as many relationships do--/r/sex isn't exactly representative of the real population) and the dynamic changes. 

/u/apassersby touched on what my thoughts were: If a girl is having problems achieving orgasm, she (hopefully) talks to her boyfriend about it. They discuss how to do better, but then she's hyper aware of the fact that lately she's had troubles. Now it's even harder to orgasm.. You get to a point where sex is a little unappealing because all she can think about is the pressure of having an orgasm. She probably also feels guilty about it because she worries that you take it personally, or she just feels bad that you have to work so hard to get her off. 

The challenge is, of course, trying to break the cycle. I would advise sitting down in a non-sexual situation and tell her that you want to have a romantic night that's just about her. Let her know how much you love being with her and how good it makes YOU feel to get HER off. Also, I obviously don't know the specifics of your sex preferences, but I find that when my boyfriend gets me off after he finishes, I can feel like it's a hassle for him to get me to finish. That's helped enormously when I get to finish before or during sex--that way I'm really in the moment. 

Every girl wants to be that sex goddess who gets off every time without a problem, but the reality is that most have a hard time with it. The key is to let her know that you're not just passionate about having normal PIV sex with her--you're passionate about HER feeling good, and that if she's not feeling that way right now, you're going to do everything in your power to change that. 

Typing that all out made it seem rather over the top, but most girls (hell, most *people*) have some degree of insecurity about themselves, especially when it comes to sex. Sometimes it takes a guy being emphatic to really get the point across. ","1383265193"

My perfect combination is 150mg of MDMA, then 15mg of 2C-B around 2-2.5 hours later.  This allows me to ""roll"" for about 6 hours, with some 2c-B visuals left over at the end.

As young as you are (about half my age), you likely haven't figured this out, but *most* people who are truly experts in any given field will not only be willing to talk to you about it and often demonstrate, but will often talk until you have way more info than you bargained for.

Most folks assume that they'll not want to talk and so they don't ask. This is usually the exact opposite of the truth.

I am fairly certain that there had been a dead decaying body (I have smelled this, so I'm pretty sure of the odor) in this car at some point and the fluids got into the carpet.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;  it is unclear whether the offenders as reported by the victims changed during the 12-month period. 

Subsets are not snapshots of all the statistical characteristics of their superset. You're unqualified to talk about this topic. Not only do we have tons of evidence showing these groups are very distinct statistically, but if you were right (omfg you're not) and we had no reason at all, we _still_ would not assume they're the same. That's not how math, science, subsets, logic work, and you're just lying to use it otherwise. 

&gt; Actually, it is. __Even if we assume that offenders assault more than one person__, that would not change the sex of the offender during the assault. So if only 100 people are raped and half of those people are male and 40% of those males were raped by females and females did not rape other females, __40% of rapists would be female.__

Jesus, thanks for directly showing how math-illiterate you are. Go read the CDC's apple analogy again. 

Hypothetical: 100 people are raped and half (50) are men. They're all raped by the same, single woman. The 50 women are each raped by different men. There are 51 rapists, and women are 1 out of 51--not half, then.

You're math illiterate. 

&gt; They did not separate them. [...] They separated the two [...]

Yeah, right, ok. 

&gt; Any lack of clarify rests solely on the CDC researchers for failing to provide that information,

Notice that the CDC also did not provide evidence of global warming. You're saying that's a failure of the CDC's survey. It's not; it's a feature. The topic was victims, so the CDC reported on victims. 

They did not survey the perpetrator population and made no claims about the perpetrator population simply because the perpetrator population was not the topic of their research, any more than global warming was. That would have required completely different research, methodology, data, because interviewing victims about their perpetrators does not provide a representative sample of perpetrator populations, it provides a sample of _victims_. 

You're math illiterate, and I am genuinely embarrassed for you. Of course, the CDC already told you all of this, so I guess this is wasted. 

My sincere advice: since you're unable to understand the topic, do yourself a solid favor and just don't speak on it. You make yourself, and anyone who would associate with you, look terrible dull when you do, and it is a real disservice. ","1383265213"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;What is stopping them from doing this now? Any bank can make any loan to anyone.

Government has picked it's winners and losers. I suggest you start with looking up how much money it costs to start a bank.

&gt;The government is guarantying the profit. That is why the rate is so low. You can never get rid of the debt until it is paid off.

If I don't pay my private loans the government doesn't pay it back. You're just pulling this one out of your ass.

&gt;My parents did not take our loans. That is what I was talking about. You can go through now and take out loans, but my parents both went to top state college while working without taking out loans. They where not making great money. This is not possible now. Tuition has risen to much and wages for low skill positions do not pay enough.

Oh good. I'm glad they've made the world such a better place that I had to work my way through AND take out loans. 

&gt;My point here is that I can empathize with you. There are programs that I am not happy with either. If I must have a government, then I would rather have a GOOD one.

No, you really can't. Government is a monopoly on violence. Even the current president agrees with that. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewQl-qAtNwQ

If you want a government, you are saying you want violence. You are pro violence for the things you want. You are willing to send other people to commit violent acts as long as those acts are committed for things you want. In no way shape or form do I empathize with you on that.

&gt;Nope. Unless you are a hermit living in a cave you will need to deal with other people. I am assuming you have specialized your skills just like most people. Some one is growing the food, making cloths and so on. You are not some mountain man living a rugged life. You have a computer and internet access. That implies a level of support for your existence that is beyond what you can do by your self on a day to day basis.

You're just not living in reality. I am free to interact or not interact with anyone I want. What the fuck is your point anyway? Because I engage in trade I am somehow beholden to other people in ways outside of the trade agreements I have?

&gt;A better example may have been NASA, FDA, or NOAA. All things that the government does at a federal level that no private company has any interest in, but that I am glad we have.

I'm sorry there is tons of private interest in those things. Government has this ability to just raise taxes and flood the sectors they want to control with their influence. That's why when NASA effectively got out of the space business three companies opened up overnight. The FDA? You have got to be kidding me. The majority of the FDA are just cronies. The actual food oversight is done by private companies. The NOAA? Seriously? You're aware that the big BP oil disaster happened on their watch right? You know those rigs have disasters similar, but on a smaller scale, almost regularly. This has got to be a joke or you are blatantly dishonest about having an idea what your money is being spent on. Or you're just glad that everything you pay for sucks. Either way, you made a very idiotic statement.

&gt;I have worked for the government in the past. Both as a contractor and as a full employee. I have seen the BS that can happen. My response to that is not to rip it all down, but to fix it.

Go ahead, stop using my money to do it. How much extra did you send the IRS last year? 

&gt;There is no reason that government can not be light and efficient. I would love to see a smaller fed, state what ever government.

Power never rescinds power. Show me 5 examples in the past twenty years. You can't do it.

&gt;The problem is that the private sector can not do 1/4 what you think it can. Sure some areas will be GREAT. But anyone not in a profitable area will be left to rot. We will end up with parts of the country that are 3rd world ghettos, while others are well developed.

You have no idea what profit is. Profit means people are willing to pay for it. People pay for it because they want it. If government has to hold a gun to people's heads and take money to make something happen maybe we shouldn't be doing it in the first place.

&gt;We will end up with parts of the country that are 3rd world ghettos, while others are well developed.

What you mean like Detroit? Oh wait, most ghettos are caused by government raising the price of living/operating a business to a point where there are no jobs and then a ghetto is created.

&gt;Rugged individualism is an admiral thing.

Wow I have no idea what that is but you are so clearly full of shit it is amazing.

&gt;I wish more people thought that way. The fact is though that the whole dam world is a lot smaller then it was even 50 years ago. A pig farmer in China can cause a flu virus to spread all over the world now. That was just no possible in the past.

Yeah, not like the people who settled America brought diseases with them or anything. Oh that wasn't 50 years ago though. 

&gt; We just do not have the luxury of pretending that we can exist in a bubble any more. The fact is we are moving to a unified world government of some sort.

Are you living under a rock? We are moving so far away from governments it's astounding. That's the entire reason why we've seen this country get looted for the past 15 years. Technology and innovation is out pacing the old establishments ability to rule. 

&gt; It is still a ways off, but we are on the path now. If we work to improve what we have now so that we have a good model on how to allow the most amount of person freedom, for the least amount of cost, then that will not be a bad thing. If we keep on the path we are now we will end up in an Orwellian nightmare.

I don't have any words for how immaculately stupid you are. I really don't. I sat here for at least 15 minutes trying to come up with words small enough that you would understand to somehow get through to you about how dumb everything you've said is. I don't think they exist. 

You are not important. I am not important. There is not a single politician at the federal, state, or local level who has a single fuck to give for any of us. Yet you think that somehow you're going to carry a banner and put out a rallying call to arms to change a power structure that is thousands of years old because... the world is smaller now?

I swear, people like you, you deserve the government you have.

"science","t5_mouw","Some do produce and communicate with light.  Fireflies, for instance.  There's nothing special about the photons produced by bio-luminescence.

Further, most creatures emit a negligible amount of EM radiation in the visible spectrum.  Humans. along with most other warm-blooded creatures, are quite obvious in infrared, and all life on Earth emits a very small amount of high-energy particles, from things like carbon-14 decay.

""Superfast light"" is either redundant, badly stated, or the product of misinformation.  All EM radiation, visible light included, travels at the same speed, just shy of 300 million meters per second.  There are a few ways to slow it down, the most common being a material that absorbs and re-emits it after a slight delay.  But none of the ones you'll encounter in day-to-day life slow it enough to be noticeable.  So all light is ""superfast"", traveling across reasonable distances quickly enough to be perceived as instantaneous.

Light speed itself is something of a misnomer, as it's closer to being the synchronization speed of the universe, an upper limit on how quickly events in one area can affect events in another.  We call it ""light speed"" because it happens that a massless particle (like a photon) travels at that maximum speed.  There are a few complex ideas that might allow the speed limit to be sidestepped (not broken), but they're completely theoretical and require conditions that are far too rare and/or extreme to be used directly by life on Earth.  So the idea of something being ""faster than light"" is, at least for the moment, the mirror image of something being ""slower than stationary"": It doesn't make any sense.

If you're going to try to argue a controversial point of view, I strongly suggest that you spend a lot of time studying your opposition.  You should always strive to be able to argue your opponent's viewpoint better than your own, both because that improves your own arguments and because your real goal is always to find the truth.  And besides, it's far less embarrassing if **you** find errors in what you believe.

Glide: Confirmed to a degree. 

You can turn your IFCS (Inteligent Flight Control System, AKA Fly By Wire) to a different mode, such as orientation mode :). This Mode will allow you to pitch, roll, and yaw to your hearts content without the system attempting to correct your true vector with where you are pointing the nose of the ship, the orientation vector. 

However Its not been confirmed to allow full 6DOF movement ever. In fact according to CR back in August there are only 4DOF that the system will be translating. It HAS to translate them because the IFCS is what tells which thrusters to fire in what directions for how long.

Source: https://forums.robertsspaceindustries.com/discussion/comment/618968/#Comment_618968

All is not lost, As he does make it clear that the IFCS can be switched to different ""Modes"" that will allow your Pitch, Yaw, Roll, and Speed Axes to be  interpreted differently, So perhaps you can get a Pseudo 6DOF flight by mode switching.  ","1383265225"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Obviously I'm not going to convince you. That's ok. The only way you can prove that MSU is worse than any of the teams you mentioned is if they played each other--which is probably not going to happen unless one of them meets up with MSU in a bowl game. Instead, I gave you statistics because that's all we have--it's still substantially more than what you're trying to argue.

&gt;Stats are meaningless when the level of opponent has been substantially lower.  

This is exactly what I would expect from someone who has nothing to argue with. That being said, I disagree here. I think if you have the talent, experience and coaching, you are going to win games regardless. A great schedule does nothing except make your greatness more readily apparent.  

&gt;Out of curiosity how many good offenses has MSU played?  

Since you chose to overlook the statistics I provided, I'm not going to do any more work--you can look that up.  

&gt;I don't see the same caliber of athletes that I see on the aforementioned teams.  

Whew! Good thing you're not a talent scout for the NFL. Sites such as [this](http://www.draftsite.com/nfl/mock-draft/2014/) have MSU defenders Darqueze Dennard, Max Bullough and Denicos Allen getting drafted. Obviously, things can change between now and the draft, but don't you feel foolish?

"SilkRoad","t5_2sidu","&gt; So in other words, yes. People have been stupid &amp; careless, they are being stupid &amp; careless as we speak, and they will be stupid &amp; careless for the indefinite future. There is no point wishing for a fantasy universe where everyone is a skill cypherpunk whose opsec is perfect.

I haven't been careless or stupid.  If people can't practice proper opsec, perhaps they shouldn't play this game.  The tools are there, if people can't, don't, or won't use them, they have no one to blame but themselves.

&gt; No, they won't do it regardless of any and all external events. At the margin, this is false. Once a market has gone down and they are desperate, choices change especially as they no longer have much reputation or future business to forfeit.

Obviously they will if they have.  A market going down and causing desperation is a lame excuse at best.  Why would you keep buyer records?  Obviously you are doing so to attack a buyer in future which is pretty slimy and has nothing to do with the downing of a website but an inclination to be slimy on the part of the seller. (note: when I said you, I obviously don't mean you)

&gt; Please see the previous point about stupid &amp; careless, and throw in additional observations about how sellers are busy running businesses.

Please see my point above about stupidity and carelessness.  In addition, it takes the click of a mouse to move your money.  I can't speak for others but I've never been too busy to click on a button, esp when it involved money.

&gt; I disagree strongly. The design of marketplaces have great influence on the actions of participants. Regulation does, strangely enough, influence people. The checks and balances do change behavior. People react to incentives - you put in escrow, and sellers do not prosper by scamming people; leave out escrow, and you get a lemon market and scammer paradise.

Feel free to disagree.  My point wasn't about escrow, it was about keeping buyer addresses.

Then Citadel came out, and it looked like this big fanservice DLC in the *best* way, and suddenly I wanted to say a real, true good-bye to my crew, so I decided I had to refresh the game for myself. 

I played all three, and I loved all three, and the combination of Leviathan, Citadel, and EC actually made the ending emotionally satisfying. *Not* perfect, or even good, but...I had catharsis. I said good-bye to my friends, I made the all-important decision, I felt satisfied I knew where the galaxy was headed. ","1383265236"

She was my gf for 2 years after this and never asked why did I bow down in the middle of the forest and start talking to God. I wasn't really a believer at this point either. She never saw me pray because I didn't nor had we ever discussed religion. She was in the vision like liquid gold. All around me was a white light. And I left my body momentarily, saw myself bowing down, and then heard God's voice. And we talked for about a minute. Then the light disappeared and the earth came back. I've been a believer since, first a Christian, now a Jew, hence ex-Christian.

But according to Judaism it isn't even really required that Gentiles believe in God. Not even much of a problem for a Jew to be an atheist either. Don't worry, you're not going to hell. Jesus was a charlatan false prophet described in Zechariah 12. That prophecy is concerning a false prophet whose hands will be pierced and who will repent of his works when the Messiah comes.

"OCD","t5_2qvqm","I think you're off-base here. While there are currently no recent posts that say ""please give me a diagnosis"", I can assure you the moderators often remove posts from people asking if they have OCD. Saying ""Hey guys, here are my symptoms, do I have OCD?"" *is* asking for a diagnosis. I agree with you, however, that asking ""does anyone else experience these symptoms"" isn't considered asking for a diagnosis - this was discussed elsewhere in this thread. 

&gt;Then just shutup or say ""maybe you do"" and move on.

The issue with posts asking for medical advice is partially that according to reddit's user agreement, simply *asking* for medical advice is prohibited. Posts requesting medical advice/opinions/diagnoses/etc. are against the posted rules, yet despite that fact they continue to be submitted. Posts of that sort are unproductive; potentially detrimental to the user who submitted it (if they decide to rely on lay advice); and detract from /r/OCD's mission of being a place where individuals can discuss their experiences with OCD and share links related to obsessive-compulsive disorder.","1383265238"

The wealthiest man in ancient Rome, Marcus Licinius Crassus, made his fortune this way. The city had no public firefighters, so he would hire his own and show up at burning buildings with them in tow. He'd offer to buy the burning property and the surrounding ones at an extreme discount, then if the landlords accepted he'd send in his goons to put out the blaze and sell whatever was left at auction. If they refused, he'd let it burn to the ground and go to the next fire.

Capitalism stresses the acquisition of wealth as one of it's fundamental principles, no?  Enough is never enough.  So as people reach a state of complete financial liberation (that point where a person literally has so much money they don't need to work) they feel like they need to continue to generate wealth and place their money in things like stocks, which will create a lot of money, but also removes that money from the physical economy.  Instead of $10 million going into a new business, it's used to buy shares of other companies to create more wealth for that individual, and then that profit is used to buy more shares, and more and more, and more.

4e (and a few years ago), we were playing some mission about poison in the water so we had to go to the sewer (I think, I may be slightly mixing this with a more recent 3.5e campaign, but anyway it was similar...) I was playing a cleric (Healing, pretty much optimized, everything I did healed/gave extra saving throws to friendlies but I also was like a dps subtank) and my friend was playing something that that marked favored enemies and got all kinds of bonuses for it or something.

We had an encounter where all kinds of undead sprang up from basically nowhere so I was blasting them away (my deity being Pelor) and my friend was ""sending them to the void"" (his deity being some goddess of death that doesn't like undead).

Some of his abilities let him step up to a favored enemy within so much  of one he just killed and half of my attack abilities were ranged and I think did extra damage to undead or something.

And, well, even though I don't really remember the specifics well I do remember me and him cleared out about 15 undead from one (fairly large) room while the paladin (tank) and barbarian (main dps) took out the ""strongest"" creature in the room (a ghoul I think, which we almost got back to before they finally killed him). None of them were really supposed to be pushovers either, that fight was supposed to be one of, like two, ""main fights"" of the session (which we decided to do a little more of instead).

TL;DR (sorry) Me (the healer of the party) and my friend (dps) made easy work of lots of undead, that wasn't supposed to be so easy, essentially by our selves.","1383265246"

Norwegian police is pretty awesome in general.


Society has a huge impact on how police behave and saying many of them are sociopaths/psychopaths are very similar to the American retribution obsession towards criminals. What do you think about rehabilitation of criminals?

Your sticking point now, imo, is kino escalation. Im sure when you were drunk it was a lot easier but its not that hard or unnatural to do sober either. Look up a good kino escalation ladder and work those steps. For example start with OVERT kino like hugging her right as you first see her and then work the INCIDENTAL KINO like sitting next to her and rubbing legs. Work both types of kino and ramp it up when you have her isolated. At some point you're going to pull the trigger on that kiss but work up to it, let her see you look at her lips while close ect., and just know that she obviously wants you to if she hasn't objected or ramped down your kino escalation. If you have already F-closed a girl and find yourself alone with her again, its pretty fair to say she wants to F. You just have to be confident- Make the move she wants you to make.

A PR agent's job is to improve public relations. If telling the community that there's not going to be a Diretide even this year is going to damage the public image, then a PR agent wouldn't say it. I'm not arguing for full disclosure necessarily, I'm saying why not hire a professional who will be able to discern when speaking out is better than staying quiet(as opposed to just erring on the side of caution out of fear of failure)?

&gt;  doesn't change the fact that that vocal ""minority"" still represents the community. How many dev.dota2 updates aren't followed by pages of ""ded gaem""?

Who cares? Those aren't the people Valve should be aiming to please anyways. Trolls have been around since the dawn of online gaming and it doesn't seem like other companies have issues dealing with it (at least not to the extend of refusing to speak in fear of blowback).

As someone else said, look at how Riot games handles their public relations. I think anyone who has spent time in both communities would strongly agree that Riot's PR is FAR superior to Valve's. And they even appeal to the same demographic of people.","1383265266"

I think that is wrong. Suspicion shouldn't play a role in the voting. Only clear cut evidence of usage (failing a test or admission of usage) should be the only two criteria used by voters regarding this the Steroid Era.

As to Bonds, I disagree. A racist, drunk, drug users didn't enhance their performance by being any one of those things (Yes, there could be something said that racists actually did enhance their performance by ensuring that African Americans were kept out of MLB and the off chance that someone used cocaine which may have helped them be sharper, although to the best of my knowledge this wouldn't apply to anyone in the HOF right now).
