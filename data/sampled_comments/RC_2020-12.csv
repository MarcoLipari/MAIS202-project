"NationalServiceSG","t5_rgaqc","There are true cases where PES F have caused so much trouble/difficulty in life where people have written in to MPs to reverse the PES F (which by the way cannot be reversed). 

It does not mean that PES F will definitely be damning for all PES F people. 

Also depends on what you are PES F for. If PES F is for previous history of cancer, unlikely you get huge problems with jobs or visas. 

CPF and Housing is indirect, i.e. you can‚Äôt get employed therefore cpf and housing affected. 

In the end, the effects of PES F can range from absolutely nothing (some people even claim they are favoured by companies because they don‚Äôt have to do reservice!) to devastating. 

In the end, good or bad, each PES F is very specific and individualised, you will have to go with your gut since it‚Äôs your life, but be prepared for potential consequences too. PES F is taken quite seriously, since it is basically SAF saying, someone is so unwell that they would not want this person to even be a service clerk in the military. 

It would be somewhat simplistic to think that you can have a medical condition that can discharge you from compulsory military service even in service vocations, and yet have zero consequences and does not affect you in real life.",1606780800

"ontario","t5_2qsf3","**TL;DR:** I've worked in both public service, including the OPS, and private industry, trust me, corruption is pretty goddamn rampant hiring manager.

However, most of this listed is in violation of hiring, union, and procurement (consultant hiring) rules, ethics, and the law. If you DO know a hiring manager that has done these things,  **please report** these practices to the HR dept, and for the OPS even the attorney general's office.

If no one reports it, no investigation occurs, and these people tend to be clever enough to keep it on the down low, not be super obvious, and/or work through proxies (willing and unwilling) so it doesn't raise alarm bells to outsiders.

Now the **deeper** breakdown:

1) "" If a manager wanted to hire their friend to an open position, they can hire them to a temporary position without going through a hiring competition. In terms of OPSEU union positions, if the employee works in that position for 18 months, they are eligible to be rolled into a permanent position without a hiring competition. ""

That only works if the person had been hired via a competition in the first place, and even then this isn't a guarantee, even if an employee has good performance. 

These temporary employees are the first cut when it comes to budgets. Most regular employees have to suffer through a bunch of temporary contracts before they finally land permanent job, which are like gold now.

I also believe that the hiring to an temp position w/o interview only works if they are already employed within the OPS, but I will admit my memory is hazy on that front.

2) ""The hiring manager can simply tell the applicant what to write in their resume and what to say during the interview to score top points from other hiring managers involved in the hiring process.""

This is a direct violation of hiring rules. The evaluation details for any hiring position, within the OPS and for a consultant, shouldn't even be shared with other OPS employees (those not on the evaluation panel/hr/procurement) let alone with outsiders.

For hiring consultants, this is a direct violation of the conflict of interest form the panelist sign  before starting the resume eval and interview process.

Does this happen? Yes, but if you see it, please report it.

3) "" If you're a director (in some Ministries) or an assistant deputy minister (ADM), you can hire your friend or family member directly to an executive assistant (EA) position without an interview process. ""

I have never seen this happen, but I've never worked directly in that area. I'm not sure if this is allowable for non-OPS employees or not (see number one). But again, if you see someone leaking/using internal OPS details for personal benefit, please report it.

Now for some suggestions to prevent issues:

1) Better training, better documentation of hiring, and auditing of hiring positions. 

2) More internal positions versus hiring outside consultants: A regular OPS employee costs an average of $500/day, while a consultant averages $800/day. 

There's loads of companies with a stranglehold on certain systems/departments because they provide consultants with niche skillsets year after year, which makes the execs a lot of money.

3) Better auditing of companies that do business with the OPS, the fact that it manager was on the board of consulting company is really disturbing",1606780801

"EdensZero","t5_jlo6l","Rebecca figuring out how her powers work. Her face literally *cracked* when she tried the third time.

Okay, I'm not worried at all. Nope.

Homura cools down in a pond(of course) as she and Shiki talk about Mother's wishes. And of course, Shiki won't take the wish if it means the other ever theirs, if there really is a limit. Unfortunately they didn't completely knock Orc out as he's able to call for reinforcements.

Space fights are always cool to see with the others.

Weisz and Hermit discussing the worst that the former will not allow to happen.

And finally there's-

...

Oh ***HELL NO!*** 

What is that big nosed bastard doing here?! Did Ziggy specifically set him there because he knew what Hermit needed to do and where she needed to go to stop the Shining Stars from going berserk?!

Wow. I mean, villain points for striking at her trauma, but that's a dick move for sure. 

In a way, he's the only major one we really don't see face any retribution for his malevolence, that was offscreened in a flashback.

Now with this turn of events, not only might we finally get that catharsis, but Hermit might be able to move past him for real and for good. Mighty good thing the pragmatic Weisz is here, she might be too emotionally compromised to really retaliate at first.

Overall, things are setting up to be...rather bothersome for everyone. Rebecca can't spam her busted power, Mother might not grant everyone wishes, reinforcements are coming, and that big-nosed bastard is back to torment Hermit again.

Reproductive coercion (also called coerced reproduction or reproductive control) is a collection of behaviors that interfere with decision-making related to reproductive health. These behaviors are meant to maintain power and control related to reproductive health by a current, former, or hopeful intimate or romantic partner, but they can also be perpetrated by parents or in-laws. Ultimately, these behaviors infringe on individuals' reproductive rights and reduce their reproductive autonomy.There are three forms of reproductive coercion, including pregnancy coercion, birth control sabotage, and controlling the outcome of a pregnancy.Reproductive coercion and intimate partner violence are strongly correlated; however, reproductive coercion can occur in relationships in which physical and sexual violence are not reported. Reproductive coercion and unintended pregnancy are strongly associated, and this association is stronger in individuals who have experienced intimate partner violence.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","&gt;Where is the third set of characteristics?

You've yet to show me why that is needed.

A different combination of characteristics is a different thing.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If the intersex person, or any person for that matter, feminine man, masculine women, whatever, feels as though their behavior is neither classically masculine or classically feminine, how does this validate a new sex/gender BIOLOGICALLY?

What does behaviour have to do with sex? You again don't understand anything being said.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Using feeling for evidence is what is called ""anecdotal"" which is not concrete enough to merit a paradigm shift in our understanding of human biology. 

Yeah. You really don't understand anything anyone but yourself has said.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Feminine men and masculine women? So, what your saying is that we CAN codify human behavior according to the gender binary?

You again don't understand anything.

Describing food as spicy or sweet doesn't mean those are the only flavours.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Why is the feminine man feminine in the first place?

...because we constructed the idea of femininity around women when we weren't that knowledgeable on the spectrum of gender.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;They likely engage in said activity because of cognitive predispositions caused by sex-specific hormones. 

You think hormones make women wear makeup? Or wear heels? Or wear dresses?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;That is what gender identity is. A man is not a women because he happens to be engaging in a feminine activity. A man feeling more feminine is simply a behavior, not a gender. 

THAT'S NOT WHAT MAKES SOMEONE A WOMEN AND NO ONE CLAIMS IT IS.

EDUCATE YOURSELF AND BOG OFF.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;A man believing he is not a man is what is called gender dysphoria. 

No it isn't.

Educate yourself.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Please, rephrase your bird and sandwiches analogy. I would love to try and dismantle that train wreck but it was too disastrous last time. 

no. 

I can't be bothered because at this point you must be a troll because no one is this stupid.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Populations ... are races. 

No.

The book literally distinguishes the two ideas. 

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;Soon, morons like you will say ""populations are a social construct""

Did you actually read this book?

""Populations also have a constructed component""

You need help.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;the scientific community will be compelled to change the word to something else yet again or else risk being perceived as prejudice by said morons, yourself included. 

Again you don't understand anything. When did I say the concept of race was prejudiced?

Are you actually a troll or actually this stupid?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;I hate to burst your bubble yet again, but psychiatrists and pharmacists, even the all-knowing WHO, are just comprised of people. People are fallible, and these people are making literally billions of dollars selling expensive hormones and surgeries to people with gender dysphoria.

So you don't have any studies to prove them wrong... they have them to prove themselves right... but they're the fallible ones?

&amp;nbsp;


&gt;Why ever could they want to normalize casual hormone therapy

CASUAL????

It's not easy to be prescribed hormones. You are ignorant.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;despite the empirical evidence suggesting that in fact the suicide rate post-operation is almost exactly the same pre-operation?

Do you mean all that evidence that doesnt exist?

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;If you don't like that you are really not going to like the violent crime statistics amongst transgender people - spoiler: 1 in 6 post-op transpersons engage in violent crime compared to 1 in 9 men and 1 in 56 women. It's almost as if the societal ramifications of giving foreign hormones to people with delusions are worse than the societal ramifications of misgendering people ... 

Source?

And how is you explanation the correct one? Again ignorant.

&amp;nbsp;

&gt;As for JK Rowling, please enlighten me as to why people are boycotting her. Sorry was boycott too gendered of a word for you? Soycotting feels appropriate.

Are you this purposefully ignorant????

See the more bags you do the more dangerous it gets. You don't know if it's more powerful or less than even the same stamp you got from the same guy last time. And so with each bag ups the odds that you will do too much and OD. 

Since Fentanyl has entered the scene I haven't seen a bag that didn't have at least a little Fent in it and towards the end of my addiction (2 years ago) they were at least 80% Fent and cut. Its literally impossible to find pure heroin on the streets anymore. And Fentanyl is *such* a concentrated opioid that it us much easier to OD on it. 

I have known 14 people in the last 19 months that have OD'd and died. Not 14 I heard of. 14 people that I knew personally. From best friends to lovers to acquaintances to drug buddies. 14. I was in the ""game"" for 10 years previous and had never known someone who overdosed and died.  Not personally. 

Side note. Since Narcan has become widely available countless lives have been saved. Countless. I've saved at least a dozen. My own life was saved three times. Everyone, and I mean everyone should carry Narcan in their glovebox in case they run into someone ODing.",1606780803

I get people are against the nuclear deal, but it seems they tore it up and replaced it with nothing, and now Iran is sitting there enriching uranium.  They assassinated this one guy, is that really going to stop it, like he was some unique nuclear genius that can't be replaced?

The trump plan was to do what they did with NAFTA - withdraw, sign a new, slightly different deal and then claim ""oh I'm such a great negotiator, Art of the Deal, this is way better than what was there before, see I'm a peacemaker"".  Also similar to what they did with North Korea (except without the part where there was a deal already).  Problem is the Republicans have a bunch of hardliners who want a war with Iran, and trump has the attention span of a goldfish, so instead we did a combination of ignoring the problem and occasionally provoking them.

So, if we don't have a new nuclear deal, what's the plan?  Go to war with Iran?  Hope that we can apply economic pressure and occasionally assassinate people until Iran collapses?  Isn't China buying a shitload of oil from Iran, seems hard for economic pressure to do the trick in that case.",1606780804

What would have been interesting is that Sanders and Trump both have the same appeal to a certain demographic, based around anti-elitism and/or globalization.  This is a something Steven Bannon has also pointed out, to the extent that he's appealed to Sanders voters to vote for Trump.

As to third party candidates, what's your point?  There hasn't been a viable 3rd party candidate in thirty years, nor have you posed any real-world scenario that could actually be discussed.

And it still doesn't change most of the other points that I made previously -- the electorate in a general election is different that the primaries (so Biden vs. Sanders in a primary is not representative of a general election). There's no follow-on higher-stakes election, and the primaries don't have the same implications for down-ballot races.",1606780804

(considering every nest's mechanics as well) / How does the DDJ damage output compare with the FMJ?

As you can see, there are one to many factors that will decide which jade is better.. But in my opinion I would go for DDJ as it does not require a lot of time to deal consistent DPS \[more like a burst type skill\] compared with 'Holy Flux' which would require a lot of time to deal consistent DPS. If you're raiding, considering that there are some areas/stages of a nest that does not give you much of a DPS window, your FMJ would not be an ideal replacement for your DDJ.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","TLDR: Go Valkyr and grab either the Hunter's Adrenaline mod or Rage mod for infinite cycle of Hysteria.

Long form: Valkyr is one of the strongest beginner frames, she needs 1 core mod (either Rage or Hunter's Adrenaline) so that any time she gets hurt, she rages and beats the living crap out of things with her claws and heals right back up for another cycle of pain. 

If you're having difficulties farming for the mods, just ask for help from a veteran in chat; we're swimming in more mods than we can possibly use and most of us have no problems just giving them to you for free. Hunter's Adrenaline is pretty easy to farm for a vet, and most have a spare Rage or 2. If you're on PC and can't get anyone to give you a spare mod and you don't want to farm for the item, PM me and I'll toss you one of my spares.

Valkyr can carry you through the initial core of the game (the entire starchart and story mode) as she did for me.

Most of the end game meta frames (back when I played a few months ago, but I don't think much has changed) are easy and super strong female frames but you need to get the right mods.

Ember and Mesa are 2 meta generalist for mid-late game. Ember burns everything she sees and Mesa autoaims and makes everything into swiss cheese. Both of these frames require some core mods in order to operate properly. Mesa is easier, but Ember can be built to out-range Mesa's guns. Valkyr starts to fall off here because by the time she gets into range other frames can kill them off (Ex: As Ember, any enemy I can see within 60m is going to be buried in a couple of flaming comets within a second)

Saryn and Octavia are also really strong at this point in mid-late game as well. Octavia is really easy to play but harder to set up and understand her mechanics, but is by far the easiest frame to play. Saryn is not too hard, and has really strong damage but needs mods to function.

For late game strong melee, Gara is sort of a cheat melee, but absolutely no one out-DPSs a properly built Gara. However she's a bit difficult to play and super hard to build for. But once you get the hang of her, she can do almost anything. She is my personal favourite generalist frame.",1606780804

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Well, having played the role for 3 years and being a draft enthusiast, I've learned that the best is to always seek to be impactful in lane and in skirmishes. You'll accomplish that faster if you limit you champion pool to a few marksmen and switch some of them according to the meta game. In season 10, for example, Ashe and Caitlyn were strong so having them in your pool alongside the ones you play the most was pretty efficient. This strategy is a long-term winner.

Also as a Jinx player I'd like to disagree with you in regards to her early game. Her early game is indeed comparatively weak compared to signature lane bullies but it's overall very solid. She can follow up engages pretty reliably with her E, deal solid dps in extended trades with her minigun, poke with her rockets and not rarely with her zap, too. One could say that she punishes mistakes very easily and is herself very punishable as she lacks mobility tools, so that puts her lane power in the strong side.

A lot of players tend to classify Jinx as a hypercarry type which plays for the late game. Her designer (Riot August) have acknowledged her early game power before to try to demystify this belief. Data analysis methods applied to LoL (published in this sub) have shown that her game stats place her as more similar to Draven, Lucian, Xayah and Kai'Sa (another one of the strong snowbally marksmen whose lane power is underestimated). You can't 1v9 lane with them as you would with Caitlyn or MF, that's right, but they definitely aren't weak. So she snowballs more often than she plays for the scaling. Knowing when you'll have room to apply any of those strategies is pretty effective.",1606780806

New Zealand has intervened in the escalating diplomatic row between Australia and China, raising concerns over a doctored image shared by a senior Chinese official on Twitter.

Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the image, of an Australian solider holding a knife at the throat of a child, warranted her government making its own protest to China.

""It was an unfactual post and of course that would concern us so that is something we've raised directly,"" she said in Wellington on Tuesday.

""Whilst that is an exchange that's happening between Australia and China, it will of course tip into spaces where as a general principle we may have concerns and will raise those.

""In this case an image has been used that is that is not factually correct. It's not a genuine image so we have raised that directly with Chinese authorities.""

On Monday, Australian PM Scott Morrison attacked the propaganda, a reference to alleged war crimes conducted by Australian troops in Afghanistan.

Mr Morrison has demanded an apology from China, which has refused to give one, instead saying Australia should apologise to Afghanistan.

""The Australian side has been reacting so strongly to my colleague's tweet. Why is that?"" Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying said.

""Afghan lives matter! The Australian government should conduct honest and deep reflections and hold the perpetrators accountable. It owes the Afghan people a formal apology.""

Alongside the diplomatic stoush are growing trade tensions, with China blocking or taxing several Australian export industries.

This move is seen as retaliation to Australian demands for an investigation into COVID-19 and speaking out on human rights issues in China.

New Zealand has raised similar human rights issues but has yet to be attacked on the trade front.

Ms Ardern said she wouldn't let the Australia-China clashes stop her government speaking out on issues of concern, saying the Tweet didn't directly involve New Zealand but ""you could characterize what's occurring in Hong Kong or Xinjiang in that way"".

""In international relations, we will often have an interest regardless of whether it's on our soil,"" she said.

""For us though we will always raise (concerns) in a way that's in keeping with our diplomatic relationships.""

Ms Ardern was supported by opposition leader Judith Collins, who said the PM's action was the right one.

""I haven't seen the Tweet but It sounds abhorrent,"" Ms Collins said.

""The government always needs to take an independent foreign policy stance.""",1606780806

Mine is being worn for my second pregnancy and was worn in between as well. 

Also leggings, the fuzzier the better. You can find those for about 20$, and the comfort they provide is intense - plus they are nice to have post partum.

I'm also at a loss to figure out ADA accessibility with this scheme.

IMHO the ""bay times"" in this simulation are overly ambitious....it takes 30 seconds for a muggle to find the door handle on a Tesla...and this being a convention center I assume many passengers will have rolling bags that have to get loaded in the trunk.  

There's also an element of entropy with cars exiting and entering the traffic stream that isn't accounted for.

**Article**:

&gt; Jen Psaki, who was named to serve as President-elect Biden&amp;apos;s White House press secretary,¬†is facing fresh scrutiny over a photo that shows her wearing a Russian hat that bears the communist¬†hammer-and-sickle logo.

&gt; Psaki, who served in former President Obama&amp;apos;s State Department, was gifted the¬†pink¬†shapka, or fur hat, by her then-counterpart, spokesperson Maria Zakharova,¬†in Russia. A photo from 2014 shows Psaki wearing the hat while posing¬†with then-Secretary of State John Kerry, who has been appointed to serve as Biden&amp;apos;s ""climate czar,"" and Zakharova.

&gt; Also standing next to Psaki is Russian ambassador Sergey Lavrov, who caught attention for an Oval Office meeting in 2017 where President Trump controversially shared U.S. intelligence with him.

&gt; The hammer and sickle has come to represent communist movements around the world. It also was a feature of the flag for the former Soviet Union, which spawned from Russia&amp;apos;s communist revolution and engaged in decades of brinksmanship in a ""cold war"" with the U.S. It has also become a symbol for brutal economic and political repression that occurs under communist regimes.

&gt; BIDEN CHOOSES ALL-FEMALE SENIOR WHITE HOUSE PRESS TEAM

&gt; Biden&amp;apos;s transition team noted to Fox News that gift exchanges are common on foreign trips, referencing how Kerry previously gave Lavrov two Idaho potatoes during a meeting in Paris.¬†

&gt; Psaki&amp;apos;s attire faced pushback from the Trump campaign on Monday.

&gt; ""Here‚Äôs Jen Psaki hugging Russia&amp;apos;s Foreign Minister and Russia‚Äôs chief foreign affairs propagandist while wearing a pink hammer and sickle hat,"" tweeted Trump campaign Deputy Director of Communications Matt Wolking.

[Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/k38dcg/storms_generations_nuzlocke_introduction_rules/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/k50icn/storms_generations_nuzlocke_chapter_2_the_squads/)

Hiya everyone, and welcome to the first *proper* update of Storm's Generations Nuzlocke! Glad to have you reading, fellow Redditors and Nuzlockers. It seems difficult to get through this journey on a first attempt, but here's hoping.

Without further ado, let's get started.

# Getting our Starter

The very first item on today's agenda is to receive our starter. Taking a look at my Trainer ID, it reads 6533**1**, and so **Bulbasaur's the pick**! I'm quite happy with this; I have rather fond memories with the Bulbasaur line, owing to my Kanto and Kalos playthroughs beforehand, and I'm confident he'll be a cornerstone for this run. Fittingly, he's dubbed **Caesar**, to be our fearless leader I suppose. He's got a Hardy nature, which really slots right in with this theme.

Blue picks Charmander because *obviously*, the man understands basic type matchups. The opening battle's done quite easily though. No elemental coverage means that after a Growl and some Tackle spam, with a crit thrown in for good measure, the first victory of this run is ours!

Next up, we zoom over to Viridian City, pick up Oak's Parcel and zoom back down to Pallet Town. We're given a Pok√©dex and Pok√©ball, so the run *officially* begins. I quickly retrieve the trusty old Potion from my PC and grab a Town Map at the kind reminder of my rival, and head out into Route 1.

# The First Batch of Encounters

Walking into Route 1, I'm joined by **Jerry the Rattata**, who's got an Adamant nature, which is kinda epic.  Next, we return to Viridian City, and proceed left into Route 22, but not too far deep; otherwise, the run would come to a swift conclusion. We look around a bit, fainting two of Jerry‚Äôs kin in the search, and on the third attempt, find a **Mankey**. I just throw a Pok√©ball to test my luck, but it doesn't even wiggle once.

A Leech Seed and some Growls later, I toss another one, and he's caught. Meet **Pacino**! After this, we walk out of Route 22 and up to Route 2, where after a brief trudge around, **Jailer the Pidgey** perches itself right onto my shoulder and joins the fray. He's appropriately Relaxed about everything, which does, unfortunately, reduce his speed, but it could be far, far worse.

I should note that when catching Jailer, I realise that I've used four Pok√©balls, and so I've got just one left.

With that said though, I charge headfirst into Viridian Forest, forgetting all about this. I step into the grass and manage to get all the way to the item on the north-west dead-end, picking up a Pok√©ball.

And here's where I remember.

Great.

I got a bit scared for a second, but I remember everything here's all bugs, which are pretty simple to catch. I don't mind a Caterpie actually. Vivillon is quite nice, and I'm guessing Butterfree would be no different.

Unbothered, I head back down where the telltale encounter animation pops up...

*Wild Pikachu appeared!*

Honestly, about 50 different emotions flick through my head. I‚Äôm both ecstatic and terrified, because Pikachu's surprisingly difficult to catch. But if I do, well... it's **Pikachu**.

After getting the electric mouse to about a quarter of its health using my brilliant Leech Seed and Growls strategy if I do say so myself, I toss a Pok√©ball.

It wiggles once. Twice. Thrice. And he breaks free.

*Shoot! It was so close, too!*

Welp. We try again though, having one last push. One wiggle. Another. And again. My heart‚Äôs in my mouth as I avert my eyes from the screen.

*Gotcha! Pikachu was caught!*

Hello, **Keaton**!

# Viridian Forest

After checking up on my party, it seems we're battered and bruised, and nowhere near ready for the incoming onslaught. Consequently, I conclude that to stay alive and prevent overreliance upon Caesar, we've gotta get stronger. So the first training session begins!

After absolutely annihilating Route 1's formerly flourishing population of Rattata and Pidgey, and purchasing a couple Potions and Antidotes, we march on over to the forest's entrance.

Unlike our last visit at pitch-black night, the sun‚Äôs shining ever so brightly onto a patch of grass just in front of us, but the rest of the short grass is illuminated by darkness. Between blades of grass a few grubs roam about, or in the case of Metapod and Kakuna, sit perfectly still. There‚Äôs an almost ethereal mood here, one that forebodes of dread.

Our first battle with a Bug Catcher is far scarier than it should‚Äôve been. All he‚Äôs got is a Caterpie and the similarly innocuous Weedle, but damn is **Poison Sting** broken. We were poisoned, not once, but twice, so I decided to use my second and final Antidote after we‚Äôre done with him. And I think to myself, if in just the first battle Jailer‚Äôs been inflicted with poison twice, there‚Äôs gonna be a fair bit more coming.

Making our way out, we run into a wild Weedle. Ignoring my sense, I try Tackling it into oblivion, but lo and behold, Jailer's poisoned *again*. And this time, I don't have an Antidote. But I do have a Potion. So promptly getting out of there, I scurry back to Viridian's Pok√©mon Center, timing my Potion to perfection, and make it out safely. That was too close for comfort.

As we're back here though, I backtrack to Route 22 and fight Blue. While this is an optional battle from memory, I think the EXP might be useful.

What I don't expect is that he's got a **level 9 Pidgey**? *Yikes*. At this moment an immense sense of fear grips me, because if his Lil' bird is at so high a level, then what of Charmander? Anyways, Keaton Thundershocks his Pidgey and knocks him out with two, but not before a crit Tackle. *Brilliant.* Charmander then comes straight out, who's thankfully also level 9. Keaton uses Thunder Wave, before I bring him away from the jaws of death and switch in Jailer.

Here, well...

&gt;!Sand Attack spam and a few Gusts later, Charmander's down. Not a single Scratch or Ember touched us.!&lt;

I'm disappointed at what I've done, but nonetheless... it worked. Moving on, we healed up, bought a few more Potions and Antidotes, and waltzed straight back into Viridian Forest. Surprisingly, the rest of the trip was uneventful, though I'm certainly not complaining about that.",1606780807

I don't think think the problem is that there are people trying to advocate for their cause or their group (even if they are paid to do so) but I think the broader problem is when politicians listen to the lobbyist rather than constituents because they are more afraid of that industries wrath than they are of their own constituents.",1606780807

"jerseycity","t5_2rznh","Currently, what usually happens is that if a project wants a significant zoning ordinance (e.g., much more density than what's allowed), they have to make 20% of the units affordable. The ordinance was basically taking existing practice, and codifying it to cut down on paperwork.

The ordinance can be waived, which means one of two things:

For smaller projects outside of downtown, they're barely profitable as is, so not getting a waiver means not being built.

For bigger projects, what's been happening is that members are trading the affordable housing requirement for goodies. What sparked the controversy was there was a project in Bergen-Lafayette called Morris Park Manor where local community groups demanded more parking, and as a result, the developer cut the amount of affordable units.

Solomon got on a high horse and basically said that anyone who opposed a no exceptions, whatsoever ordinance was literally a monster, and then turns around and happily demands an exception.

Some exceptions are good, some are bad. My issue is that he was being a hypocrite and a liar.",1606780808

Well first of, yes Wales is technically considered a country as is England and Scotland, but practically though you're really part of the country known as the United Kingdom. The Welsh aren't bared from the government of the UK, one of our most popular PMs was in fact Welsh.

"BoringCompany","t5_3i1oo","The main problem with using 'loop as freeways' solely is as you mentioned as you get closer and closer to the city all traffic converges and you'd need some massive freeway/tunnels to really handle all of the traffic. Worse a lot of the traffic chokepoints are at say intersections and even with tunnels you'll still need to exit onto streets or parking areas. Sure for bypassing the city you can kinda solve it, but for going into the city -- tunnels by themselves don't actually solve the issue.

I think a hybrid of 'loop as transit' (the las vegas proposal) and 'loop as freeways' would serve suburban to downtown needs better than going all in for 'loop as freeways'. Basically use at-grade freeway center lanes for traveling from the suburbs but then enter tunnels when near downtown. The key part is unlike normal train stations the suburban entry point can be anywhere not just at a freeway. If its low traffic perhaps its SOV, though probably it'd be a shared car similar to uberpool.

For suburbs to suburbs honestly I think self driving cars can just use freeway carpool lanes, and maybe self driving vans if they reach capacity. The only thing that needs to be added is a center lane exit.",1606780809

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","A few points
&gt; Animation by it's nature means absolute control over everything that's happening on screen which while it can create some truly incredible things will never have, as Orson Welles called it, divine accidents.

You do make a fair point but I do think you do overestimate the absolute control a studio has when making an animation and I guess it depends on the studio in question. The guys who make south park have absolute control since they do it all in house but its pretty normal for companies to do storyboarding/scripts in the US/country of origin and then basically outsource the rest of it to a foreign company/companies to animate the thing and results can be a mixed bag. So they could just get it reanimated (which is costly and time consuming) or edit around it by using prexisting footage/scenes. 

&gt;Voice actors can't improvise, characters don't miss their mark on set, animated sharks don't have meltdowns.

improvisation does happen and I guess it depends for the type of animations but for 3d animation, you mostly get the VAs to do their lines first before animating it. So during the recordings they can improvise (Apparently Mike Myers cost Dreamwork 4 million pounds to reanimate Shrek due to him seeing a rough cut and deciding to do a Scottish accent instead) also for shows that are getting localized, you do have VAs who try to basically match lip flaps, so people can improvise there.",1606780812

1. They're lazy and want to make it as easy as possible for themselves
2. There is some political uncertainty right now so I'd imagine the budgets are being ""used sparingly"" for the time being until they get more certainty about what's going to happen in January, so for example there may be pressure on them to ""use less gas"" or something like that
3. All their tech equipment for ""whatever they want to do to you at this phase"" (probably DEWs) is set up in a fixed environment.

This happened to me to and for a while it SEEMED like a good idea until I started investigating a lot of strange health problems that I started developing, which happened AFTER the ""stay at home"" type suggestions.

They almost had me going for a bit too.  Until I started wondering about the sequence of the suggestions and then me having strange health problems a short time later.

Then I learned about DEWs and realized ""No WONDER they wanted me at home more!""

They probably have some specific part of their assignment like ""deploy DEWs for 4 hours this evening"" and your constantly going in and out makes it hard for these losers to earn their bonus for their ""jobs"" of basically pointing a box at you and pressing a button.

i mean, I didn't like that call either, but once you decide to go for it you have to think through the options, and that one wasn't a short one. That play is very much boom or bust and relies on surprise, if the D is surprised, it could hit big, if they aren't, then it looks like a mess.

However, due to my hair type, I don't have a huge donor area so my doc was also saying that I shouldn't waste any donor hairs on the hairline if I'll need to fill in the area just behind my hairline in a few years time.

As a general principle, in the opening you want to move your center pawns but not your wing pawns unless you want to fianchetto your bishop.

Your priorities should be to move your minor pieces once each, castle your king, and connect your rooks, in that order. If you‚Äôve done all of that, have at least one pawn on a central square, and haven‚Äôt lost any material by move 10, then you‚Äôre in good shape.",1606780814

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","Lol I've been professionally in this industry for over a decade.
Yes any lab CAN test for it. But how many guys are going to essentially double their investment of the whole cycle to have it tested? VERY few.
The majority of guys using janoshik are the labs themselves.  Testing to make sure they've done a good job with the grade 11 chemistry used to make their product.
For every result of 98% pure...how many 50-70%'s do you think there were?  And if you spend thousands on a batch that comes back 55% purity...do u throw it away? No.
You make more batches and have then tested until u get that 98%....share it all over the internet. Then mix in the shitty bottles with the rest of the product.  If a customer gets poor gains from a cycle..its been ""tested to 98%"" so it must be a training/recovery/nutrition issue.

Just bc a UGL has tested 98% doesn't mean they're all 98%. You can't be that naive.  Plus the testing is too expensive in north America to have them test it every batch or two.
There's a reason why most UGL's don't last more than 5 years.  And it's not bc of the law.  It's bc they come in the market with huge hype....good purity tests...usually sponsoring a few bodybuilders (who were already huge) to use their gear...sales go thru the roof...then things die down bc word gets out that the product is mediocre.
So the lab changes labels/bottles etc and BAM they're a new lab.  Release new purity tests...sponsor next wave of bodybuilders etc. Repeat.",1606780814

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","It could be a type of algae bloom, if so it‚Äôs best to just too wait it out. What can happen is people freak out change the water over and over but if its that, what their doing is just starting it over again and again prolonging the process. as long as your waters not messed up Ide say just wait it out it‚Äôs most likely due to a spike in nitrates because of the new poopers. As long as your tanks cycled properly. But I‚Äôm not an expert. This is common in new tanks I believe as it begins to start balancing out biologically especially if you‚Äôre doing a fish in cycle.

Edit; oh I missed your second question like the other guys said cichlids are pretty aggressive with anything that‚Äôs not them. They also tend to fight over territory that‚Äôs why that guy suggested a larger surface area, it‚Äôs not how tall the tank is it‚Äôs how long. They tend to hang out on the bottom.  Cichlids setup little territories and if theirs not enough areas for the number of fish they just tear each other apart specially if their stressed do to improper fish in cycling. if that‚Äôs what your doing keep a close eye on ammonia and nitrites because when they spike you need to do a 25 to 50 % water change to drop them to safer levels otherwise your lil guys are gonna have a bad time. Also if your doing a fish in cycle make sure to slowly add fish start with what you got and wait till you filter and tank items build up some biofilm so the nitrifying bacteria can break down the ammonia to nitrates which are relatively harmless to your fish then you can add a few at a time let it balance again and repeat till you‚Äôre happy with your tanks stock. 

Also nice tank I like it. if those are real plants they look healthy. i would of probably gone with a few types of tetras like a nice school of neon tetras and some other schooling fish. Even some black skirts would of looked nice in that tank I love those tho so I‚Äôm biased their not the flashiest fish but they school real nice. Oooh even some tiger barbs their nice. So in conclusion this tank isn‚Äôt ideal for cichlids I wouldn‚Äôt put many in it. unless maybe you could get another type of fish that swims in the middle water column or the top so they stay away from the cichlids but that‚Äôs just my on the spot theory. cool tank setup tho cheers.",1606780816

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Answer: This hasn't been asked here in a while.  TL;DR originally a stunt by a marketing student, but it took on a creepypasta life of its own, because Internet.

&gt; This Man, according to a website created in 2008 by Italian marketer Andrea Natella named Ever Dream This Man?, was a person who was claimed to have been repeatedly seen in dreams by the whole world since 2006, but was never found in real life. Natella created the site in 2008, but it was not until October 2009 that it gained attention from the press and online internet users. 

...

&gt; However, a 2010 post from the ""artgency"" website Kook, which Natella became a partner of while This Man was gaining traction, and a published paper he wrote in 2012 titled ""Viral 'K' Marketing"" finally confirmed that This Man was not real but rather a stunt.

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","&gt;Can this be multi-threaded?  
&gt;  
&gt;Yes  
&gt;  
&gt;What about async requests? How much would that help?  
&gt;  
&gt;I plan to use threading or async once I have to fastest possible single request function  
&gt;  
&gt;Is the server going to lock you out for making too many requests too fast?  
&gt;  
&gt;No, this is for our own site  
&gt;  
&gt;Can you batch up multiple requests as a single request (I'm not sure if all these requests are made to the same server or to different servers)?  
&gt;  
&gt;No, each request must be independent  
&gt;  
&gt;How big is the request/response? Is a faster network going to make a difference?  
&gt;  
&gt;The response is ridiculously small

I am aware that the request itself will be the largest bottleneck, but for this specific usecase I need all of the other code optimized to be as fast as possible. In other words, my program must make a request faster than any other program can.",1606780817

"nonutnovember","t5_3pnv2","I know way too much about that. I was a medical student before I switched to engineering due to fucked up unrelated health issues, alot of personal issues and crippling depression setting in. Back then (when I was still well) I wouldn't let myself be distracted by anything,would study easily from 8am to 9pm (very easy to do during the 3 days preceding an exam) and procrastinating wouldn't even be a part of my vocabulary. I did have a problem with porn and ADHD med ,however through putting a firewall everywhere I managed to make it a non-issue


100% of my studying is on my computer except when I'm doing exercises in engineering classes that don't require coding. 

Sadly I noticed that thinking of the aftereffect often isn't enough when my brain thinks about the ""high"" I'd get by watching porn. The pleasure side often ends up winning over the consequence side. Although thinking about the pleasure I get from working on myself/my goals and gradually becoming a better version of myself works most of the time as long as I don't lose track 

Started reading some self help guide that apparently helps deconstructs this whole porn addiction and makes you see it under a totally other perspective ,explains the trap,why you're hooked ,how to stop it. It seems quite useful and not overly judgy at all. Apparently it's an essential guide

Thanks alot for the tips, I will definitely learn to limit how much free time I have. I used to do that years ago back in med,saying it was useful is an understatement. Although I was a bit too extreme haha",1606780817

So because of that whenever I speak Spanish in front of unwitting people I blow them away with it &amp; I find it quite amusing.

My point is if you‚Äôre so inclined I recommend you work on &amp; practice your Spanish. I work in hospitality where there‚Äôs a lot of native born Latinos so I‚Äôd practice my Spanish &amp; ask for translations of words constantly, learning &amp; speaking all the time. 

If you don‚Äôt have that luxury then I recommend listening to Spanish radio or shows with subtitles like Narco‚Äôs. 

Whenever I speak Spanish it really helps me feel like I‚Äôm connected to my half Peruvian roots.

Plus don‚Äôt be so hung up on your race but be proud that you‚Äôre unique. You got something special about you that nobody can see on the surface. So when the occasion arises that you have to speak Spanish you can blow people away.

"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","The hero-narrator of The Catcher in the Rye is an ancient child of sixteen, a native New Yorker named Holden Caulfield. Through circumstances that tend to preclude adult, secondhand description, he leaves his prep school in Pennsylvania and goes underground in New York City for three days. The boy himself is at once too simple and too complex for us to make any final comment about him or his story. Perhaps the safest thing we can say about Holden is that he was born in the world not just strongly attracted to beauty but, almost, hopelessly impaled on it. There are many voices in this novel: children's voices, adult voices, underground voices-but Holden's voice is the most eloquent of all. Transcending his own vernacular, yet remaining marvelously faithful to it, he issues a perfectly articulated cry of mixed pain and pleasure. However, like most lovers and clowns and poets of the higher orders, he keeps most of the pain to, and for, himself. The pleasure he gives away, or sets aside, with all his heart. It is there for the reader who can handle it to keep. J.D. Salinger's classic novel of teenage angst and rebellion was first published in 1951. The novel was included on Time's 2005 list of the 100 best English-language novels written since 1923. It was named by Modern Library and its readers as one of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. It has been frequently challenged in the court for its liberal use of profanity and portrayal of sexuality and in the 1950's and 60's it was the novel that every teenage boy wants to read.",1606780818

Why bother throwing away your litter in a trash can rather than on the ground?  The amount your litter adds to the dirtiness of the city is negligible.

Why bother voting? The chance your individual vote affects anything is negligible.

Why not steal someone's wallet? The amount of crime you are contributing to the city's statistics is negligible.

All of these statements fall under an informal argument called ""the appeal to futility"".  Technically, there is a point that no one individually is making the world that much worse. But the ethics of our behavior isn't always best evaluated from a consequentialist perspective. And even if it is, then you are not acknowledging the actual affect you have. Not only would you not be buying animal products, but you would also be purchasing plant-based alternatives.  You're supplying a demand that is making ethical food choices easier for yourself and others who may follow.

Why would they think you‚Äôd be ok housing them?? I can understand they don‚Äôt want to be split up from their children, but also they need to consider that this is the easiest way to keep some sense of normalcy for the kids, being in a familiar place with their brother.

"europe","t5_2qh4j","The North industrialised after unification, before that it had some artisanal centers. Naples was a financial center in the 19th century, home to one of four Rothschild banks. Industrialisation in the north was financed largely due to looting the south.

That analogy also does not explain why west and south Germany are, and were, richer and than the east. It's also why Northwestern Spain is richer than Southeast, why south England is richer than north England, and why some of the most productive and industrial parks of France are in the west while its more agrarian parts are in the west.

You can find all kinds of reasons and stereotypes, but proximity to Europe's center is the most consistent reason to explain regional disparities, almost all the other arguments are prejudicial and simplistic.",1606780819

BTW, we had a ""Cherokee ancestor"" myth in my family, too. 23andMe debunked it. I really do wonder why white people of previous generations lied about having Native ancestry, since I don't get why it was such a fad. Although sure, there were some marriages between Native peoples and whites, there was an awful lot of rape and sexual slavery, too.

"TooAfraidToAsk","t5_2ssp7","&gt;being located in majority minority communities not heavily trafficked by outsiders or tourists  
&gt;  
&gt;suffering from poor public funding which disproportionately affects minority communities (poor infrastructure, poor visibility/access, lack of other nearby attractions to draw in consumers, etc.)  
&gt;  
&gt;gentrification which greatly increases the overhead costs, meaning a once profitable business may start to struggle and eventually be pushed out  
&gt;  
&gt;the difficulty and risk of running a small business in general

\- what does an area not heavily trafficked have to do with minorities? People can open their businesses anywhere. On top of that, many businesses are online. Then on top of this, there are plenty of non-minority owned businesses around those areas. The first point just doesn't make any sense

\- poor public funding has to do with private businesses? Poor areas =/= black areas/businesses, and saying ""support black businesses"" doesn't mean I'm going to travel to a rough part of Detroit to purchase goods

\- Gentrification also increases cost of goods in areas. ex. I can get a haircut for $12 in a suburb, but the cheapest haircut I found in a gentrified area was $30 (for an apprentice), mostly $40+

\- What does the general risk for a small business have to do with black people?

&amp;#x200B;

Everything you have mentioned has to do with being poor, not about being black. On top of that, things like public funding has nothing to do with small businesses. Then, your first and last point has to do with anyone who owns/operates a business in general. Location matters, and it sucks, but it costs a lot more money to rent/purchase in a good area.

I noticed that each reso of the pillar does dmg and triggers every 2secs. By itself, it does 32% dmg, add in a geo object, 64 and another 96(thinking geo mc here). Thats 48% dps compared to Diluc who can do 321% over 10secs or 32.1% dps. The kicker is c1 adds another stele effectively doubling dmg(need testing).

&amp;#x200B;

As we're all aware his burst hits fairly hard as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Just saying we should hold back a bit saying he's a failure as a nat5. With proper setup he will mostly likely have one of the highest sustain Elementals, a respectable Burst and doesnt require much field time.

Another thing i noticed is resonance doesnt apply geo debuff so unlike a support like fischl you can use him without worrying about triggering annoying reactions and lowering your over all burst.

Ofc this all requires proper testing and over all viability of team comps but I'm thinking he may be one of the best supports in game.",1606780822

In fact, I do care. D/ST aren't comparable only between themselves. They are comparable to the rest of your positions as well. The default IDP scoring is crap, on ESPN at least, if you don't tweak it and make IDP relevant. Otherwise, you just don't draft them and pick anything from waivers.

But when you have an IDP with potential to score the same as a WR1/2, that's a nice addition to the game. I don't like IDP because of the lack of research to be done on it, and despite FF being unpredictable by nature, it just adds more unpredictability. But they are nice to play for fun.

Same goes for D/ST. The Patriots last year were scoring the same as a RB2 every single week. I don't like it, but that's me.",1606780823

"DynastyFF","t5_2umu4","Found this thread, and as actuarial type, long time fantasy, first year dynasty.   Few observations I have picked up  on.

1. Agree. Established / Starting players are depreciating assets in trade value.  But for a competing roster, those assets generate wins and championships.
2. Future picks are currency or ""capital"", that can be spent in the future.   Unlike established players, they will escalate in value up to the rookie draft.   Highest value will typically be when the pick is on the clock.
3. Rookies .  Once a pick is made, that rookie pick loses value like a car driven off the dealer lot.   You might think Jalen Reagor is a stud WR, but other's might not be sold on his potential.   A pick on the clock has higher value, than the actual player drafted.
4. Bench Players - Draft Picks become rookies who become future speculative starting assets.  Most bench players won't become starting assets, but some will.   Having a too deep bench of start-able assets is a good problem to have, but it is a problem, because those assets are depreciating, and not generating wins now.
5. Capital Management : Player capital (depreciating) and draft capital (increasing) needs to be managed.   I currently have a strong 2020 roster with good established players, and hit on 3 rookie studs in Gibson, Robinson, and Claypool.   I also have two 2021 first round picks.  Depending on how the pre draft offseason impacts my roster, I am likely looking to trade my first round picks for 2022 picks so that I don't have too much of my capital deployed in 2021 ""bench"" roster versus draft picks.   I can always spend draft capital to improve my active roster capital when needed.   But when you draft a rookie, we now have a risky asset.   Draft picks is currency to buy assets improve your team.
6. League life expectancy - Nobody mentioned this, but life expectancy of a typical dynasty league is only a few years, some will go for many years, some fold quickly.  Anyways win now, because tomorrow isn't guaranteed is a theme.  Thus banking on future picks to win ""eventually"", eventually might not every come.   My league has some issues that make me believe that is a real risk the league doesn't make it to next year, but it is hard to predict, and everyone has to get a feel for their own league.   So their is a risk in investing in picks and thinking compound interest will win you league in 5 years, and league folds after 2 years.
7. Plug for Crowdsourcing dynasty value site.   ""Keep Trade Cut"" dynasty values is free dynasty value based on group ranking 3 random players (or draft picks).   Based on continual polling, they rank players based on wisdom of the crowds.   Being an actuary, I do develop my own value over replacement over expected remaining career valuation, IE my own view, but I find Keep Trade Cut (KTC) values is a great ""market"" perspective of players value.   Not sure how DTC does their values.",1606780825

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","&gt; I very directly did. ""Get rid of first-past-the-post-voting, institute proportional representation vs. winner take all, appoint judges by nonpartisan committee, abolish the Senate""

I stand corrected. Sorry about that.

&gt; Passing laws to this effect is different than enshrining it as a permanent and guiding principle of our governance. 

I don't really agree with this statement. It's different only in terms of degree. The constitution can be amended, laws can be passed / changed / repealed. The only difference is the amount of votes needed from the appropriate body(s), both to make the change in the first place, and then to modify it again afterward.

&gt; The Constitution is pretty clear that the President appoints federal judges, with the advice and consent of the Senate. I suppose the Senate could choose to defer to the guidance of an independent commission, but that's pretty hack-ish, and it doesn't eliminate partisan Presidential appointment.

The Senate can make their own internal rules. Nothing stops them from making rules about how they go about deciding whether or not to confirm a particular judicial appointment other than that it has to have a vote at the end. Voting along political party lines is just the current ""unwritten"" rule that we have now. Deferring it to another process is just as plausible as what we do now.

I personally doubt that any process that you could describe couldn't somehow be corrupted by either partisian-ness, or something equally as bad, though. So I'm not sure it makes a difference either way.

&gt; So why are you so married to keeping the same Constitution? As I said earlier I don't mind a total overhaul via amendments, but that just seems so much messier.

I'm not married to keeping the ""same"" constitution, I just don't see a difference between a total overhaul via amendments and a clean-slate version, in terms of theoretical outcomes of the document itself.

However, I can elaborate a bit on why I think it's not a good idea to do a ""clean slate"" approach.

I'm a software engineer, and in some aspects, laws / the constitution are like software in the specific sense that they are a written set of instructions intended to be interpreted and executed by a specific audience. Software is intended to be executed by a computer, and the Constitution is intended to be ""executed"" by a collection of people.

In software, doing very large wholesale refactorings on a codebase to ""modernize"" it can be extremely beneficial, but it almost always results in bugs being introduced during the process.

A technique that can reduce the amount of bugs that manage to make it into production while still getting that sweet sweet refactoring goodness, is to do the refactoring a chunk at a time, scrutinize that single refactoring-chunk with lots and lots of diligence, and then let the results of that refactoring-chunk ""soak"" in production for a couple of weeks to see if anything came out of it.

In many situations, the per-chunk refactoring process allows the team to realize issues with the underlying design by comparing the before and after, both in terms of the code and thought-gaming theoretical situations, but also in terms of actual production behavior. You wouldn't be able to get those realizations as easily by doing everything as a whole-cloth re-write. 

This prepares you better for the next refactoring-chunk, because your team is now better equipped with a deeper understanding of what the actual consequences of the code are, even if that understanding is only ""Yep, works how it's supposed to"".

So specifically, my concern with a proposal like ""Abolish the senate"" is that its an overwhelmingly large change. The whole concept of checks and balances in the current constitution explicitly depends on the Senate as a thing. Removing/abolishing the Senate as a single commit/amendment is going to have large and drastic unintended consequences to the behavior of the system at runtime.

If your objective is to truly abolish the Senate entirely, then a better approach would be to migrate functionality from the ""Senate"" module one feature at a time into another module (either an existing one, or a newly created one), and then observe the behavior of the post-migrated system in production for a while. That lets you better understand if you've made a major clusterfuck mistake or not before moving onto the next thing to migrate.

-------------------------------

Further the ""software""/constitution itself is subject to security vulnerabilities. Hackers figure out how to trick software into doing bad things every day in the modern world. Similarly, politicians and lobbyists (and others) spend an enormous amount of time and money to ""trick"" the political process for their own ends.

Any fix to the ""software""/constitution intended to correct a ""security vulnerability"" or ""bug"" in your view, is going to introduce new unintended ""security vulnerabilities"" in an objective sense, and new ""bugs"" in the subjective sense of people who don't share your same viewpoint not liking your changes.

Case in point, I personally think that abolishing the Senate is an absolutely horrible idea.

I do wish we could have any other voting system than first-past-the-post, though, so I'm right with you on that one.",1606780826

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","Please, everybody, share your answer to that question because I don't feel that my limited experience is enough for a good answer.

As a lazy ass, I would start with some existing and popular architecture like ResNet, and when I prove that it doesn't work in my case, I would start modifying it, by hypothesizing why it doesn't work:

\- Does it overfit (compare training and test metrics)? If yes, can I solve it in a cheap way by augmenting the data in some additional way to prevent overfitting?

\- Does it fail to train (instable train performance, weird weights)?

\- Does my input actually have enough information to solve it, eg. can I as a human looking at my input in the chosen resolution classify the image properly?

Often I would try to split the problem then, for example instead of classifying the image directly, first build a model that would find interesting segments of the image, then cut-out them and send them to another model. Or process the image using some domain knowledge and fixed logic or simple ML models, and feed the result as additional input to my deep learning model, etc.

There is no science in this though, so it is basically a wild guessing.

As of ""understanding the model"", yes, I do look at the visualized convolution weights and if I see too much of them repeating or blank, I'd know that model fails to learn properly for one reason or another.

All of these are not in control of the student and isn't up to the student's effort.

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Independente de opini√£o pol√≠tica, uma an√°lise puramente econ√¥mica (em sentido positivo) desmente o que voc√™ disse.

A teoria microecon√¥mica b√°sica nos diz que aumentos externos no pre√ßo (multas, taxas, impostos, etc) s√£o arcados pelo consumidor E pelo produtor, sempre. A divis√£o dessa carga √© regida pela elasticidade de cada um. Nesse caso espec√≠fico, o consumidor √© definitivamente muito mais el√°stico, pois ele tem op√ß√£o de outros produtores - produtores esses que n√£o foram multados. J√° o produtor multado n√£o tem muito como mexer na sua estrat√©gia, pois incrementar o pre√ßo necessariamente implica em perder vendas. Al√©m disso, como se trata de um distribuidor de produtos fabricados por terceiros, √© muito dif√≠cil de ser salvo pela ""lealdade √† marca"" ou coisa do g√™nero, pois a Kabum n√£o √© uma Apple.

Em resumo: quando Estado pune um produtor espec√≠fico que age de m√°-f√© em um mercado suficientemente livre (i.e. sem oligop√≥lios, colus√µes, etc), este produtor N√ÉO consegue repassar a multa no pre√ßo dos produtos.",1606780828

Remember, epoxy will stick to poly resin but poly won't stick to epoxy.  Your boat was probably built with poly so either resin will work.  Cover wood with two layers of woven fiberglass called 1708.  Cover that with one layer of chopped strand fiberglass.  Fiberglass doesn't like to lay down over sharp corners.  It will bubble up.  Round over the wood top edge with a 3/8"" round over router bit.  Soften the bottom inside corners with polyester resin mixed with cabosil.  It will thicken the resin to a peanut butter consistency.

1.Get the soundtrack downloaded on your PC (I had mp3s, dont know if other formats work)

2.Go to spotify on your PC and open settings

3.once there look for an option akin to 'add local files' and select tye folder with the OST

4.On the tab with your playlists should be position colled 'local files'

Now you can add the OST to your playlists. Once you add a song to a playlist you can even get it on the mobile version if you download the playlist.

You're treating her assault so dismissively in this post, only talking about her behaviour and how it impacts you. She must be picking up on your opinion of her, and if she is then that's probably why she's acting out so much at you.

You need to take a step back. Your sister needs support, not her older sibling treating her like she's a nuisance. Don't blame her for your poor mental health, that's on you for being self-absorbed.",1606780829

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined post &amp; comment karma (award karma DOES NOT COUNT)

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

1) cut your hair short if it isn‚Äôt already
2) take a trip somewhere with sun and a beach
3) Get your scalp wet in the ocean, and work your way up to 3-4 hours of sun exposure per day. Use oil free sunscreen massaged into your scalp, but try and minimize use.
Within 2-4 days you will see your inflammation disappear and the crusts will harden, flake, and fall off.  Within a week you will be mostly clear.
After years of avoiding the sun at the direction of my useless dermatologist, I discovered this by accident while on a beach vacation.  Now I take at least 3 beach vacations per year to buy me reprieves from this curse. During the summer months, I mix up natural sea salt in water (Israeli Dead Sea Salt), soak my hair, and take the sun‚Äî works almost as well. Give it a try... Also works amazing for acne.  Sun alone doesn't do it nearly as effective based on my testing, so it's some combined action between the sea water and sun.

EDIT:  Btw, my sebderm also has little dandruff, though I thankfully haven't experienced hair loss.  None of the shampoos worked much for me either, with the exception of DHS Zinc shampoo which helped a bit, and nightly ACV/Honey overnight hair wraps.",1606780829

"AskDocs","t5_2xtuc","NAD but here‚Äôs what I told my adult child in a similar situation:

Re bright red blood during bowel movements, the higher in the digestive track the ‚Äúinjury‚Äù is, the darker the blood (old blood = dark dark) and the brighter the blood, usually the lower in the tract. Lower is generally less emergent, unless it‚Äôs copious amounts.

The intestines need mucus to move things along and is also part of the body‚Äôs response. 

When ‚Äúthey‚Äù talk about blood in stool, it‚Äôs usually referring to blood WITHIN the stool, notsomuch blood AROUND the stool. 

Yours sounds like it could be a cousin to hemorrhoids, an anal fissure. Build up of gas or even bouts of constipation or dehydration can cause this.

I would keep an eye on it and keep track of your movements and a basic log of what you eat and how much fluid intake. This way, you may see patterns over time related to diet or dehydration.

If it continues or you have other symptoms, don‚Äôt hesitate to make an appointment with a healthcare provider, but I personally wouldn‚Äôt send my adult child to urgent/emergent care.

Seeing any blood can be unsettling, to say the least. I hope this gives you some insight.",1606780830

"KindVoice","t5_2xjrr","Hi,
I'm so sorry that you're hurting. The first thing that you should do is to acknowledge how resilient and persistent you are. You're no failure, not by a long shot. After all you've been through, how are you still standing? That alone takes guts and grit. Honestly, it's impressive.

It's completely understandable that you miss your little brother. This does not mean that you're weak, it means that you are still an attentive big sis. Please allow yourself to grieve, but remember that he would be proud to see you keep going. Do whatever you can to help yourself feel better to get through all this pain. One day at a time. Walks, baths, films, friends, crafts, even music, whatever helps you get by.

Spend as much time with your grandpa as you can, but not to the point where you're getting overwhelmed by anxiety. He knows you love him, and that's what matters. Just keeping him company in your spare time and talking about some of the nice moments you've spent together and the thinfs he's done for you that you're grateful for will mean a lot. If his time is approaching and if you are on good terms with the rest of the family, it might be a good idea to check if all his funeral arrangements are in place. That conversation is painful and some can't stand to even mention it, so take my words with caution since I don't know your family.

As for school, something that I can actually advise you about, the first thing to do is to take a piece of paper and write down all of your courses as a list, leaving a lot of space beneath each one. Try to pinpoint the week when you started to fall behind. Write down the number of lessons you've missed. Then, in bulletpoints, write down each assignment you have to do and lesson you have to learn. Use the syllabus for the lesson names/topics. If necessary, break down the assignments into smaller tasks. It will feel overwhelming and awful, but as you make a schedule to tackle them one by one, you'll see that you've got it. It will all be down on paper, ready for you. Planning is half the work. It's not yet beyond repair. You can still fix this. Don't be afraid to ask your colleagues for help. Reach for every resource and friend you have. If your school/uni offers free counseling, go for it, nothing wrong with extra support. Even if you fail now, you'll be making it easier for yourself to pass it next time.

This is turning into a ramble (it's late here), but before I finish this comment, I need to remind you that your grades and your finances are not a reflection of your worth. Even if you fail in school, you've still achieved much. Your worth is determined only by what sort of a person you are right now, and by your post, I'd say that you are a kind and determined one. You are worthy of much love and respect, and don't let anyone tell you any different, not even yourself. You're struggling right now, but none of the things happening to you are your fault. You haven't put yourself in a shitty situation, you ended up in one, and you're trying to get out of it. You're doing the best you can, according to your current knowledge and capabilities. You're gonna be okay. You got this. You'll get through this.

Sending you a virtual hug. Hope you feel better soon.",1606780830

And it's not certain Jake will produce to the level he has in the past. 

Either way we're likely losing a good player. I personally would rather lose 32/33 year old Jake at 8.25M, than 24 year old NAK who's dirt cheap at the moment. If we can keep both- even better.

Keep in mind contracts may be a little cheaper than expected the next year or two due to the flat cap. Could get a player similar to Jake's caliber for less then 8M.",1606780831

"anime","t5_2qh22","&gt; Because human beings are, all in all, creatures with terribly narrow outlooks, we can't help but want to solve any problem that might occur in our lives, but when you sit up and think about whether every problem that comes up over the course of a lifetime has to be solved, you may be surprised to find that not to be the case at all. Well no, of course it's better to solve a problem than to leave it unsolved, but when you take a broad look across the world, you unexpectedly find many problems that have been left sitting there, and while they do spew forth so many problems that it's a problem, people around them may have actually accepted them along with the harm that comes from them. In fact, having solved a problem sometimes results in greater chaos and confusion, though not always. There's the fact that people dislike change even if it's evolution and prefer stability no matter how unstable it is, but prior to any of that, an ""environment"" is what already accepted the problems as problems, or so I think. I mean, honestly, it's as though people feel most ""alive"" when they're confronting a problem and agonizing, suffering, and accumulating stress over it. Rather than the consummation of a longstanding wish or love bearing fruit, maybe life is about ""problems""? In that case, you might say people don't strive to make their dreams come true; they dream just so they can strive. Geez, what sort of nightmare drama is that? 

Nisioisin's afterword for [Neko:Kuro](https://www.reddit.com/r/araragi/comments/7ex02c/nisio_isins_afterwords_first_season/) 

Interesting episode overall. Honestly, Hana is one of my least favourite arcs [Arc spoiler](/s ""mostly because I feel that ep3 really drags it down"") but it still has its great qualities. 

Ougi just casually being like 'what, I've always been a boy', and the reveal of Araragi's legendary status is pretty funny. 

I've always liked this idea that, even though he'd never see it like that, but if you actually think about it, his personality, who's he surrounded by, he really seems like a proper badass for his underclassmen. [Koimonogatari](/s ""and then you have Kaiki, who sees him almost as just an immature little kid haha"") 

Another aspect of the perspective change again is seeing another side of Kanbaru, a much more restrained, normal girl with a lot of self-doubt and self-deprecation. It's a topic that I thought about a lot irl as well, when you interact with different people you tend to act differently, too. And whether you have a set personality and just 'put on various masks', figuratively speaking, for other people or it's different aspects of your personality coming out at different times. How other people see you and how you see yourself, that kind of stuff. I'm not gonna copy&amp;paste that part, but the Nise I afterword talks about this as well (I swear I'm not *that* immersed in Nisioisin-lore, I just happened to read them right before I watched today's episode) 

One last thing, the visuals at the end of the episode were so beautiful, even for Monogatari's standards, they really stood out for me.

Not even a distant land  
We're stuck on a whole different planet  
No peace lookin' at the sky

Trouble's always all around so we stay quick with the guns and cannons  
Standing as long as we can until we get all Dolls up

Then call all bets off  
We'll blow through your tar  
Dealing with lives messed up

On a sea of dark matter  
Every minute matters  
Living while other lives shatter

Seeing ghosts scatter  
As they Pour out  
We can handle them

It's the tar taking over that came unexpected  
Hard to accept it  
Getting marked for death

Seeing friends snatched and darkly possessed

The tar inside stealing the body and breath  
Till only a shell is left  
Witness to Hell in the flesh  
A Fight to the death  
Screaming Where's the relief?  
Maybe no more sleep

All swallowed in grief  
Images Start to stalk like a beast  
I hear voices but no one talking to me‚Ä¶

It's like I'm washing away  
All my peaceful days  
Anyway Anyhow  
Nothing left of that scene  
If you are losing your way  
You need some protection  
Black tar, it gets you  
Where ever you go  
They could find you quickly, it's sticky  
However you try to tough it out  
You just can't beat them

They said seek to find the field So we can sharpen skills  
But Now we can only feel  
All The pain of the danger being real  
And we may have to kill  
Just to stay alive  
Cause They've taken away close mates  
And we don't know our own fates

We've been tasked to protect and take on ghosts  
But now this black tar is new  
And the damage is quick  
It moves really fast  
Plus it covers everything  
This wasn't in the profile

So Now We've got to find a way to win or we die out

Living life on the run  
With a hand on a gun  
Where's the exits  
We can't go back where we came from  
We can't go back where we came from

Get armed, Don't look back  
Shoot them with your guns  
Yes, Get up, Don't give up  
Shoot them  
All the power you got

Hello‚Ä¶? Is this thing on? Am I all alone?  
Is anyone there?  
I need a bigger gun Help if you can

Please wake me up  
Not to sound cliche  
But this world sucks!

So close it's a voice I'm hearing  
Overwhelms me, Can't stop bleeding  
Show me ........ in the fog  
How many times you gotta kill your friends?  
How do you feel you gotta shoot their head?  
Just like the endless war  
WAR‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

How do I know?  
This goddamn stuff is all around  
How can I get out?  
This nightmare I've got to escape  
Just screaming  
You hear them over and over  
You will get running  
So we can find the way to get out

We're stuck on a different planet  
A lot more than we can manage  
But we gotta keep on standing  
We're stuck on a different planet  
A lot more than we can manage  
But we gotta keep on standing  
Just want live in peace yet  
Black tar's gonna keep us restless  
Running just to own our own breaths  
Just want live in peace yet  
Black tar's gonna keep us restless  
Running just to keep our own breaths

People are dripping black tar

As much as I would love the Valve lenses and audio of the G2, if Samsung released an equivalent resolution HMD (it would also have the same tracking since that's WMR 2.0) then it would be tough. Comfort and image quality (pentile but with samsung's anti- screendor tech maybe?) would be an interesting comparison.

I would hope that at the same resolution, any image clarity lost with Samsun's headset due to pentile/anti-screendoor tech would be minimal.

If the virus is able to mutate the spike protein's RBD to a great enough extent that the mRNA vaccines need to be updated, I assume that that will be because the original vaccines aren't providing sufficient protection.  Which will mean that there will be a new wave of disease and death and the FDA will want to get updated vaccines out as quickly as possible.  As mRNA vaccines will be the easiest ones to update, I doubt they'd want to saddle them with too many regulatory hurdles if they're just changing a few amino acids.

"socialskills","t5_2r275","Relationships take practice.  If you never want one, that's fine... but honestly, after years and years of dating people are just looking for others that are at the same place they are relationship wise.  I can tell you that I have dated people with no relationship experience after having quite a bit myself, and it's kind of a struggle.  It's like trying to explain advanced math to someone who's just learning elementary algebra. Everything takes practice, and romance doesn't happen in real life like it happens in movies.  The initial hormonal rush happens, and if you know what you are doing you can grow that rush into something even more beautiful.  If you don't, it sort of just slips away.  If romance is what you want, get practice.  If you don't care, then don't.  Simple as that.  It's never too late to change your mind, but do keep in mind that as you get older it gets more difficult to find those who want to ""go backwards.""  That's why many people are taken aback when people don't get that sort of practice.

Some people love having partners.  I love mine dearly, and wouldn't trade him for the world.  Real love, to me, is the most beautiful and rare thing to exist ever.  My parents are growing older, and my brother has passed away... I am somewhat of an introvert and don't have tons of friends.  Having a family, having people that are (hopefully) going to be there no matter what for the duration of my life is extremely important to me.  Having a happy, loving relationship to build that family off of is even more important - and, in fact, is something I have practiced for since I was a teenager.

Other people, like you, think relationships are a bunch of drama and suffering.  That's fine, too.  Honestly there's no ""right"" way to live, and I never judge people who are single.  You just have to decide what you want in life, and go for it.  I know many happy, successful people who straight up do better on their own.  I respect them just as much as I respect my friends that are already married.",1606780835

"Christian","t5_2qjy5","I think a great way to approach it is to remind yourself that before your parents are your parents, they‚Äôre also people. And people are flawed. As kids we tend to put our parents on a pedestal and when we grow up and catch a glimpse of them as they are we can‚Äôt help but be disappointed. 

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, some parents really are terrible, but growing up your parent probably faced issues in their families and that lead them to creating behaviors (although not necessarily good) to survive their environment. I.e not showing affection because it resulted in negative reactions in their families or ignoring problems because they‚Äôve never learned how to properly communicate their problems. Even though it‚Äôs been years, our parents are coping the best way they know how. 

I think in order to best deal with (or this is what I did), recognize that our parents come flawed, try to remind yourself that this is where they‚Äôre at right now and we can‚Äôt change them (Pray that God softens their hearts towards you, since really only He can change them). Lastly, work on yourself, try to be more loving and more kind, even if they don‚Äôt respond positively or in the way you want, you can at least know you‚Äôre trying your best.

And sometimes the reality is: we don‚Äôt like our parents, but we can still love them.

I hope this helped in any way :)",1606780835

All those statistics are just numbers, It's not like you're definitely gonna get lung cancer."" 

Your marriage is doing fine (**for now.)** Your wife is faithful (**for now.**)  Many of your peers have been in the same position and assumed their life would keep tracking on that course only to be utterly blindsided. 

You live in a world in which popular culture seeks to undermine every aspect of your relationship and family unit.  Maybe most terrifying of all is the material incentive to bail on you when your utility wanes, so please keep that condescending ""I found mine"" attitude to yourself. 

I don't even fully disagree with you, **but acting like you aren't sleeping with a landmine is naive.**  All it takes is one smarmy feminist friend telling your wife some recontexualizing propaganda and suddenly she sees you as an abusive rapist.

Horizontal stacking should help you fit more books, yes.

My advice:

1. Reduce your collection, getting rid of books you aren't likely to read again and which have no sentimental value.

2. Get a storage container or two, and pack away books that you're not likely to read again soon.

3. Get a bigger bookshelf :)",1606780837

&gt; Se trata de los pozos 318 de Jardines de Santa Clara, ¬ìNicol√°s Bravo II¬î, ubicado en la colonia Jardines de Morelos Secci√≥n Islas, y ¬ìAbel Mart√≠nez¬î, en la colonia del mismo nombre, ambos en desuso desde hace m√°s de una d√©cada, a pesar de la carencia de agua potable que enfrenta Ecatepec.   

&gt; El alcalde Fernando Vilchis Contreras, dio inici√≥ a los trabajos de restauraci√≥n del pozo profundo 318, ubicado en ¬†Jardines de Santa Clara, el cual no recib√≠a mantenimiento desde hace ¬†20 a√±os.   

&gt; Alrededor de 19 a√±os pas√≥ en completo abandono y sin operar el pozo 307 ¬ìNicol√°s Bravo II¬î, ubicado en calle Isla del Socorro de la colonia Jardines de Morelos Secci√≥n Islas, hasta que el actual decidi√≥ reperforarlo, lo que beneficiar√° a m√°s de 112 mil habitantes de esta zona.   

&gt; En tan s√≥lo 180 d√≠as se realizar√° la obra, que abastecer√° de 35 litros de agua por segundo a los vecinos, luego de que administraciones pasadas se olvidaron de este pozo, que ser√° reperforado con inversi√≥n de m√°s de 13 millones de pesos ¬†del Fondo de Infraestructura Social Municipal y de las Demarcaciones Territoriales del Distrito Federal (FISMDF) 2020.   

&gt; A√±adi√≥ que a estos trabajos se suman la construcci√≥n del techado en el preescolar ¬ìRosaura Zapata¬î, en la colonia Luis Donaldo Colosio, y la construcci√≥n del parque lineal en avenida Luis Donaldo Colosio, que realiza el gobierno federal, adem√°s de que como parte del ¬ìProyecto Jaguar¬î se instalar√°n c√°maras de videovigilancia en la zona.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","&gt;Come on my little Chinese flower, you know we‚Äôre not going to agree. 

The only way for you to get me to agree is for you to prove your position.

I have exposed your position as wrong, so you should change your mind. 

It's very simple: Are you being proud of being an unreasonable bigot and admit you won't change your mind despite being wrong... do you admit you are wrong and change your mind and apologize for spreading anti-Chinese disinformation... or do you have further arguments to make to substantiate your allegations?

&gt;You‚Äôre very angry and upset... I don‚Äôt like it when you get like this.

Do you think your bad faith personal attacks are relevant to this conversation or will somehow excuse your unreasonable attitude and bigotry?

&gt;Let‚Äôs just agree to disagree

Well, no. Let's not. You are wrong and cannot substantiate any of the horrible beliefs you have and the accusations you made.

You are spreading disinformation. This isn't a ""disagreement"". This isn't a matter of ""opinion"". You are objectively wrong and refuse to acknowledge it. The things you said are harmful propaganda. They are hateful disinformation to make people hate and fear China while you are attempting to make excuses for the Australian war criminal, capitalist regime.

Okay? Cool.

&gt;I have my delusions and fuck, you certainly have yours and well, your fan fiction, you have that going for you too.

If you acknowledge that you are delusional, why don't you acknowledge that what you are doing is wrong and change your opinions and apologize for promoting hateful disinformation?

Meanwhile, I fail to see any ""delusions"" on my behalf. You have been repeatedly given the chance to justify your accusations, but clearly can't. Everything I said is substantiated by evidence and arguments. 

&gt;Can we just realise we see the world differently?

Again, we are not discussing ""views"". We are discussing factual reality. Either something is true or it is not. If you make anti-Chinese comments, you need to prove them. If you can't, you need to admit that and change your views. You know... like a reasonable adult. 

Are you denying that factual reality exists?

&gt;I see Chinese concentration camps, you see re education camps.

Again, this isn't a matter of opinion or disagreement. This is you spamming anti-Chinese propaganda and me calling you out. Define concentration camp, then explain what exactly China is doing wrong, then provide conclusive proof of your accusation. If you can't do that, then your position is debunked and you should be ashamed of yourself and apologize for spreading lies.

&gt;You see a high approval rating for the CCP, I see people who are too afraid of disappearing if they don‚Äôt ‚Äúapprove‚Äù

And you believe your deranged opinions to be an argument? No, people aren't afraid of disappearing in China for disapproving. You are a delusional racist believing bullshit anti-Chinese propaganda. Whether Chinese people are afraid of disappearing for disapproving of the government isn't a matter of opinion. It's not a ""view"" you have. It's a falsifiable accusation that you made that is based entirely on hateful propaganda lies spread by fascist organizations that you choose to believe without evidence. You are brainwashed. 

So, we do not ""disagree"" as these aren't just interpretations. This is you making a claim about factual reality that you cannot substantiate and which is contradicted by the evidence, making you wrong.

&gt;I see a thriving organ harvesting mechanism using political prisoners, you see zero waste and medical benevolence (at a price)

No. You blindly believe anti-Chinese propaganda lies without evidence. I acknowledge that these are debunked lies spread by radical religious propaganda organizations not supported by any evidence whatsoever.

&gt;So, at the end of the day I don‚Äôt think this is going to work out and yes, I think we should start seeing other people. Maybe one day you could put aside your Chinese fan fiction and write about us, you could call it ‚ÄúThe fork and the power socket‚Äù why some people can‚Äôt get past their differences.

You need to stop projecting, Australian.

You need to understand that just because everything you believe is based entirely on fictional accounts spread by fascists and other anti-communist trolls and paid propaganda organizations, it doesn't mean that anyone else bases their positions on such propaganda, too.

Everything I believe is based on facts and evidence. I do not comment on topics I do not have a thorough understanding of and do not claim things that I haven't fact-checked myself. Got it? There's a big difference here. You are promoting debunked lies and are a biased individual who made bigoted, unreasonable comments... I'm a reasonable person who is promoting the factual truth and has called you out on your bullshit and gave you a fair chance to justify yourself, which you clearly can't.

I mean, you are highly representative of 100% of all people spreading anti-Chinese opinions. Non of you is ever capable of producing arguments and evidence supporting your views. You are straight-up unreasonable bigots spreading Nazi-style propaganda without excuse. Thanks for proving yet again that all Westerners criticizing China are ill-informed losers unwilling to change their ignorant views.",1606780837

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I'm not saying here ""ban alcohol, legalize weed"". I don't use it and have no intention of doing so in the future. What I meant is that the basis for keeping marijuana illegal is that it's a drug which alters the brain functions of the user, making them slow or violent, not to mention that it's considered a gateway for other worse substances. Most of those assumptions were already debunked by modern researches anyway but to sum it up, it's illegal because bad things happen when people use it. But doesn't all those same things happens to people who abuse alcohol? And you're right, prohibiting it altogether would probably give a boost to criminal organizations which already profit a lot with drugs. Cartels would get even richer dealing illegal booze too. Then I'd suggest more harsh laws. Zero tolerance for people caught driving or commiting any infraction under the influence. People should think a little harder before deciding to sit on a driver's seat after heavy partying. They should be really scared of the consequences.",1606780838

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I just find the idea absurd for many reasons. Many religions posit that a God or Gods created an entire universe and yet he created man on one single planet in that universe and we're supposed to believe that we're somehow *that* special. Religions state that God created people yet the earliest civilisations had religions that we now view as pure fiction... I think that the closer you are to an event, the more accurate your account would be. Thus, Aztecs, Ancient Greeks, Ancient Romans, Pagans, etc. are likely to have a better grasp on how humans came to be, but modern people subscribe to modern religions. I believe in evolution and many religions have a tough time backtracking enough to accommodate it. I believe in letting people live the one certain life they have in a way that they chose, rather than forcing obscure rules on them on the off chance that Heaven is real and they chose to follow the right rules to get in. There's all the bad that happens in the world - I don't believe it's God's plan. People say God doesn't make accidents to justify being pro-life... so they feel that God means to give babies life-limiting conditions and force babies on parents who end up abusing their children (or worse). To me, religion just defies any logic and the scriptures are full of holes because they were written by people of yesteryear with limited understanding of science. 

I'm not a mathematician so this may not hold up, but at a basic level, there's a simple 50/50 chance of being correct that there is no God. The remaining 50% chance there is a God is then further fragmented by the million different Gods (and their myriad rules) that you could worship. What if you choose the wrong God?",1606780838

Addressing two of your examples, Kelek and Shallan revealing stuff to Adolin. 

We got Kelek's 'you killed me' note as epigraphs, it's not hard to fill in the blanks with regard to what Shallan learned from him from those, and it'd be redundant having that be a separate scene again.

In the case of the off-screen reveal scene, at this point did we really need to see it? We know enough about both characters, and in particular the trial and the evidence you can bring deadeyes back, to get a feel for the idea Adolin would be accepting of Shallan's situation without needing a scene where she relates all of that information again.

Would both scenes be neat to read? Probably. Are they really necessary though? I don't think so. Epic fantasy is obviously an indulgent genre when it comes to this sort of thing, but leaning too far into the side of indulging leads to your story getting away from you, I think.",1606780840

This Man, according to a website created in 2008 by Italian marketer Andrea Natella named Ever Dream This Man?, was a person who was claimed to have been repeatedly seen in dreams by the whole world since 2006, but was never found in real life. Natella created the site in 2008, but it was not until October 2009 that it gained attention from the press and online internet users. This Man's notoriety spawned several internet memes that spoofed flyers of the website, references in films and television shows like The X-Files, and a manga series based on the hoax by Weekly Sh≈çnen Magazine.

I think that this video could have been a bit more explicit about the gendered nature of these kind of exchanges. Dating apps aren't just a place where you go to buy a new partner, they are a platform where, inherently, women are the product and men are the customers. On these kinds of dating apps, there's no reason for women to pay a subscription, they are always drowning in matches. But often for men to be successful on these kinds of platforms without sinking every waking moment into them, they need to pay some sort of subscription so that they can directly see who has matched with them already. This matches up with what we actually see in the data as well--men are 16% more likely to pay for a membership to a dating app. But it's more than just the app, it's the nearly mandatory expectation to pay for the first date or offer gifts.

As a woman who has dated, offering gifts is the weirdest one. It's surprising how early on some men will offer gifts. They're often small things, like a knickknack or stuffed animal, but it's enough where it can be easy to tell that this person is trying to actually buy you. And that's a really odd feeling.",1606780840

Out of that, 9.8% went towards ‚Äúsocial aid grants‚Äù. There are several different aid packages in that, but let‚Äôs be generous and assume that half of the money goes towards parental support.

That‚Äôs still 0.4\*0.1\*0.5 = 0.02, or 2% of the total budget. He‚Äôs wrong by an order of magnitude, and that‚Äôs in my social democratic country.

And since taxes aren‚Äôt the state‚Äôs only source of income, and private citizens aren‚Äôt the only taxpayers, the actual number will be more in the ballpark of 0.5% or so.

I already made playoffs so I‚Äôm wondering if I should keep the current squad or try to get now players now if it needs improving 

QB: Brady

RB1: Aaron Jones

RB2: James Robinson

WR1: Adam thielen

WR2: Amari Cooper

Flex: Chris Carson

Flex: Wayne Gallman/ Duke Johnson

Before today fuller was my WR2 and cooper/ gallman were my flex 2 options but now idk if I should maybe try to trade gallman and Johnson for a better player like a Michael thomas or someone else from someone still trying to make playoffs or if the current squad I have is good enough to advance through playoffs already.",1606780842

I think every gay man should take self-defense classes, especially if you live in an area or country that is not the most accepting. It's not just for your own safety, it's also a massive confidence-booster, and really gets you in touch with your masculine side if you want that. This is controversial because a lot of gay men are understandably left-leaning politically, I'm not really right-wing myself, but I do support and encourage gay men carrying a gun or other weapons for self-defense in places where it's legal.

Another thing is being weary of people you meet online, especially on seedy apps like Grindr. Meet someone in public *first* before you go to meet them in some secluded place.",1606780842

If you are able to change the shipping method, I'd recommend that. There is no indication when JP will resume EMS to the USA. Japan's also the bizarre one in the region - I've had orders from China/Hong Kong/South Korea come in days in the last 6+ months without much issue.",1606780845

As I‚Äôm sitting here thinking about it, why do you wait to figure out if a guy is into you? The natural dynamic between girls and guys is such that you usually have the ability to choose from an array of guys (although that doesn‚Äôt necessarily include that one dude who you really want). If there is a guy you find attractive, go for it in a way that fits your personality.        
       
Allow him in your personal space, let him know you‚Äôre ok with it through your body language, and even encourage it. Find excuses to touch him, there is nothing more attractive, then when a girl who you‚Äôre into touches you for the first time. Give him those brazen hints like asking him to help you with math even though you get 90s. Give him attention.          
       
I think you‚Äôll find by doing that, guys will either make it clear they‚Äôre not interested by rejecting those opportunities to get close to you, not wanting to be touched/shrugging off your touch as if to say they‚Äôre not comfortable with it.",1606780845

I've never been big into the 2D platformers, so I hadn't really paid any attention to Ori until I happened to start watching a LetsPlay of it and became enamoured by just how beautiful the game looked. Ended up buying and absolutely loved it. Didn't experience any performance issues or bugs, I don't know if that was a console thing only, as I was playing on PC, or if I just got lucky. Ended trying a few more 2D games as a result, including Dead Cells, which is fantastic.

Negatively surprised: DOOM Eternal. I really liked DOOM 2016, so hadn't been following the marketing for Eternal that closely, as after the first trailer or two, I was sure I would love it just as much. Then a few days before release when people started reporting on all the changes Eternal made to 2016, I got a bit concerned. The concern quickly became serious disappointment when I actually played it and realised that I didn't like most of the major design changes made from 2016, to the point that I refunded it. Ended up changing my mind and repurchasing it a few days later after thinking that maybe I'd been too hasty.

&gt; U.K. restaurants, bars, cinemas and sports venues may require proof that people received COVID-19 vaccinations in order for them to visit, Britain&amp;#039;s vaccine minister said Monday.

&gt; Nadhim Zahawi, the U.K.&amp;#039;s vaccine minister, said getting vaccinated should be voluntary, but a phone app used for contact tracing may include a person&amp;#039;s vaccine status, which businesses could use.

&gt; Several COVID-19 vaccines are getting close to being distributed across the U.S. and U.K. in recent weeks, as the worldwide death toll has reached 1.4 million people.

These people are finding out the hard way that they can be lied to the way they want to be lied to on youtube, twitter, reddit, facebook, and on television...ect, but not in court. That's why Rudy is holding fake ""hearings"" being broadcast on OANN, and youtube, in rented hotel rooms. Because they understand that their audience *demands* their propaganda and lies now.

Amazon smoked all their competition. Hundreds of retail giants could easily have destroyed Amazon, but they all backed the wrong model and they're dead now.

Yes, there is anonymity behind addresses, but the ""system"" as Cohn calls it is fully transparent, though it may not be transparent to him because he has refused to actually research the technology.

"CallHerDaddy","t5_s6oo7","It‚Äôs not about him not being hot, it‚Äôs about the very well known fact that guys who aren‚Äôt white are disproportionately affected on dating apps and get less matches overall.


https://www.datingstudies.com/studies/race-online-dating/

So I‚Äôm telling him this because he‚Äôs new to dating apps. It‚Äôs going to be a very different experience than in person dating and he will get less matches because of it so it‚Äôs a good thing to be cognizant of.

Edit: Also I‚Äôm brown, because apparently everyone assumes everyone on the internet is white and apparently I have to say that to talk about differences in racial experiences on dating apps. Cool.

Edit 2: I guess it doesn‚Äôt matter what statistics you cite or what the people you know personally experience or  you‚Äôre race is even if you share it with the person who the thread is in reference to. You‚Äôre wrong for simply mentioning that race impacts dating app experiences. Got it.",1606780848

Yes, manufacturers have recommended setups, but they're ballpark guides rather than gospel. The question is whether you like how the guitar plays; if not, it's time to adjust it.

Intonation is the exception, as there's no benefit to having notes out of tune. There is no need to tune down when intonating; if you're making massive changes, just retune the strings to pitch every so often during the process and check where you are.",1606780849

So the first hit there‚Äôs an effective 30bp difference in power (240 compared to 210) in favor of Max Fireball but on the 2nd hit assuming sun is still up there‚Äôs a 75bp difference in power (240 compared to 315) in favor of Max Flare.

The ability to ignore abilities, mainly Mimikyu‚Äôs disguise, should not be taken for granted and is an excellent effect for Fireball. It all comes down to team preference. 

I think Rillaboom makes better use of its G max move compared to Cinderace or Intelleon because it already sets up grassy terrain so it doesn‚Äôt need to use Max Overgrowth to set it up. Cinderace and Intelleon appreciate setting up sun or rain.",1606780850

You're limiting your tree to only be put up at the Rockefeller Center"". The 50k + upvoted and 150 + awarded video above these comments doesn't seem damaged. It seems like it catered to the exact audience it was made for. So the video functioned perfectly fine for its intended audience.  


Our field of view is just that, our field of view. But the way we view art, media, or entertainment can be warped. It's the reason planetariums, building projections, AND vertical videos are still engaging despite not being equivalent to our field of view. And just because a few films are vertical doesn't mean that future films can't ALSO be vertical.  


To your final point. Demand is driven by necessity and curiosity. Developers created phones that have screens that are vertical. This leads to app developers creating vertical apps and animations for ease of use. That in turn leads filmmakers and animators wondering how they can make meaningful productions on a vertical frame.  


Finally, it's a bold statement to say a format is ""not good"". Generally speaking in today's day and age filming with 16 mm film is not good. However, many horror filmmakers will utilize 16 mm film to get the grain effect of the '70s. Vertical video isn't bad, it just isn't your cup of tea apparently. And that's ok because you were never the intended target audience.

Here's a really cool vertical video: [https://vimeo.com/108980280](https://vimeo.com/108980280) The use of vertical framing really showcases the scale of these slot canyons and makes for a phenomenal experience. You may or may not like the video and you may not agree that vertical was the best use for a video like this, but you can't dispute that some find vertical video interesting and intriguing.  


For the above video, my target audience were reddit users watching on their smart devices or computers. I don't ever intend on putting it on a large screen at a theater or on a television. The video served its purpose perfectly and was entertaining. Therefore it was a success and I for one am happy with the response I've gotten from it. Especially this one because I don't get to have these conversations with peers often enough.",1606780850

According to the post she did NOT refuse to sit down and talk.  We know this because she raised her concern to OP.  That is talking about it.  And what did OP do?  Did OP sit and talk to her about it?  No.  OP said ""That's not my problem.""

According to the post, she said she was unwilling to move in the context of discussing this decision . That is a far cry from actually saying that she's not willing to move at all.  Also, that's not stopping him from getting a job.  There's more than one solution to every problem.  

Which is it?  Can jobs be done remotely or not?  Unless you have some information on what those particular jobs are then it doesn't make sense for you to assume that she can work remotely and he can't.  Either we're considering that jobs can be done remotely or we're not.  You assume her job can be done remotely and his job can't because it supports your point of view.  That doesn't strengthen your argument, it just shows your bias.",1606780850

Weekends are trickier, my general belief is 2-3 days worth of theta will vanish by close of Friday so in most cases you may want to roll early on Friday or better yet on Thursday.

Makes no sense to capture a couple of pennies more if you lose a couple of nickels and dimes on the option you are rolling to. 

FYI, I never take assignment since a CC = CSP.  And by rolling on Thursday or Friday I capture some of the time value of the weekend.  You can't do that if you accept assignment and have to wait on Monday.  Sure, prices could swing both good and bad but I don't want that volatility.",1606780851

"HealthyFood","t5_2rhbm","**To all participants, a couple of reminders before you join in:** 

Nutrition is not a solved science and diet approaches are often based on individual needs and circumstances. This subreddit caters to all approaches to what is deemed ""healthy"". Each POV has the opportunity to share info within the rules. Sometimes we get more of one POV set than another but the waves come and go. Don't generalize other participants or even the subreddit itself just because you don't get the votes you want or because others disagree with you and certainly don't attack anyone for it. You do not have to agree but *EDUCATE your POV rather than BERATE them for theirs* 

**Avoid being rude** 

* Per our reddiquette rule; Do not engage in insults, trolling, or other antagonistic behaviors towards anyone in this sub (even when others break the rule). Downvote complaining is not allowed. Talk about the food, not the other person.

* Be respectful towards other dietary points of view. Crusading, diet shaming, food ethics / morals, and absolutism are not allowed. Diet warriors, be aware that this is not the place to camp in wait to bash others with your beliefs.  

* Do not add comments calling food disgusting, gross, or any other non-constructive criticism.  Do not claim foods as non-healthy without citing specific studies proving it (with links).  Again, people come in varieties so AVOID absolutist claims.

If someone is violating a rule, don't fight fire with fire.  Report rule violations.  If things get ugly, you can counter points with science, never insults. You can also opt to just walk away.

**TLDR:** Educate. Don't berate. No complaining or diet war BS

Also, baking with cannaoil or homemade butter also permeates your *entire* house, regardless of how well you ventilate. If the OP was WFH during this they would have known, full stop. It's horseshit to believe they didn't unless they live in a 5000 sqft home. Sorry not sorry, I don't believe they didn't smell it. Who the fuck doesn't know what weed smells like these days?

I definitely felt like leadership was bait and switch because as soon as I accepted my first leadership position, everything went from kindness to criticality.

- and seals degrade over time, so the water resistance rating is only for when it‚Äôs new, not for when it‚Äôs been in existence for a few weeks/months/years

"guitarpedals","t5_2r0bp","Have you checked out Greer pedals by chance? They have a pretty solid array of transparent overdrives in a lot of different flavors.

Personally, I use the RYRA Klone as an always on pedal to keep things in that ""edge of breakup"" zone. I also have a boost/conpressor (wampler mini ego) that goes after to keep thing smoothed out just a bit. Thats set with a little boost on the treble side and blend knob down a bit so i retain the dynamics. Now, how much do you adjust your playing dynamics of your pick hand and control the volume knob on your guitar? Thats kind of key to be able to control the ""transparency"" of the overdrive. Im a strat player (s/s/s style) myself and can get my sound from clean (by picking softly and/or volume down) to crunchy AF (picking super hard and/or volume full up) by just controling those couple things. Then if i need/want to really punch it up, i have another overdrive/distortion that stacks underneath the RYRA, and a muzz pi fuzz that goes on top (all before the compressor).

Have you looked into changing out the tubes in your amp? When my hot rod deluxe was my daily driver amp, changing out the tubes (also adjusting the bias up just a bit) made a world of difference. I also had a volume attenuator in the effects loop so i could get those tubes hot but not blow out the windows.

"socialskills","t5_2r275","Yes. In middle school I was that one kid that everyone knew but was still excluded from the group chats. Then something happened in 8th grade and I pretty much became an outcast. I attended a high school that I felt I just never clicked with anyone (it was a relatively small school) So as you can imagine, my ‚Äúhigh school experience‚Äù was pretty lame. It‚Äôs not that I have social anxiety or anything like that either. I did make a couple friends and I still talk to one or two now. However, one has spoken to me less and less now.

I was determined to work on my social life in college but then I decided to attend community college and now everything is online. So I‚Äôve pretty much made ZERO friends while in college. I pray that I make new friends before I graduate 4-year college because making friends becomes exponentially difficult once you become an adult in the real world.

Most people on here will say that none of the shit before college really matters and its true. But it‚Äôs tough when you feel like pretty much every setting &amp; circumstance in your life has been a detriment to your social life and that you‚Äôve been mostly lonely and left behind nearly the whole time.

I still feel lonely even with few friends I have. I watch people I attended HS with still having fun with their HS friends even to this day. However, I‚Äôm still the captain of my destiny and I try my best to do online dating and create friendships/relationships that I want. It‚Äôs definitely tough though and I can definitely empathize with you.",1606780855

"projectzomboid","t5_2sdk8","That's a really stuck up way of thinking. The fact of the matter is - if you get bitten, you might as well just start a new game. That's ""hardcore"" but in a bad sense - the point of hardcore modes is that you are punished a lot more but you are rewarded twice as much .

The problem with the lore is that apparently you are IMMUNE to the airborne strain of the virus, and it would only make sense to reduce the chance a single bite can cause an infection if you treat it fast enough.

Again - the lore shouldn't be a basis on how you design gameplay. Gameplay is the sole reason why it should matter. The very fact that you would need to treat your injuries as fast as possible to REDUCE (not eliminate) the chances of infection would open up so much more in scenarios/organic tactical choices that could happen in the game (as mentioned in the OP)

AKA ""Do you book it to the nearest hospital to find disenfectant/bandages?"" ""Do you heal up now when the horde is converging on you, risk being bitten again/ getting surrounded and munched to death or do you try to find a safe spot at the risk of the infection spreading?"" ""Am i infected? Or is it just the flu? That last bite could have been unlucky""

Although it's ostensibly about Octopuses, the whole first part of the book explains, in really simple terms, the basics of the origin of life. It explains not just *how* but *why* evolution is the natural result of basic biochemistry, and takes us through early forms of life and what caused them to evolve into more advanced forms.

The book also explores the evolution of the mind from its origin as simple signals between cells to trigger sensing/moving responses, right through to our minds today, and how different kinds of minds have evolved in different kinds of animals. It's really easy to read and it'll open the door to insights about our world (and our own human nature) that you've probably never had the opportunity to learn before - i.e. from a biological rather than a theological view.",1606780855

WHEN YOU DONT EVEN KNOW THEM.


Hell you are even wrong about the false rape bullshit because by your definition of rape. 70% of men and women think forced vaginally penetration is sexual assault not rape.

So you arent even fucking right about that.


Hell you are basing your biases on something that varies state to state, some states don't count it as rape unless physical violence(knife punching etc) is involved.

So fucking excuse op for not having intimate knowledge of something you yourself don't fucking know.

Hell brock turner, the rapist, got sexual assault charges when he penetrated a woman.

&gt; The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is working on a common approach to ensure digital behemoths, such as Alphabet Inc&amp;#039;s Google and Facebook Inc, pay their share of taxes as the coronavirus hammers budgets.

&gt; &amp;quot;Canada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.""

"Competitiveoverwatch","t5_34fcy","Albless left on his own from Defiant. GM role was changed within the organisation to more of an administrative role and it wasn‚Äôt what he wanted. He is interested to be involve in the sport side and not being part of it made him decide to part with Toronto.

He said he began his time in Toronto as assistant-coach and assistant manager. He was mainly assisting Jay (old GM). He had a flexible role inside the team. When Jay left, he became GM, 2-3 week before he left in a smooth transition from Jay. He thanks Jay for his support in the ORG for the help. He didn‚Äôt have a raise for becoming a GM.

After Defiant was defeated in the final, Albless had a big hand in preparing for 2021. He started trial really fast because he knew there was a long of young prospect and finding a good coach to finally replace Fefe would take time and it would be too late if they would wait to hire a coach first.

Toronto really wanted to keep him, but the org wanted to put the Head Coach as the sole responsible for the sport results during the restructuring of Overactive (the parent company of Toronto Defiant and Toronto Ultra). He loved working on the sport side and being involved with the staff and player, and it was working for Defiant at the time because they didn‚Äôt have a HC ever since Fefe left. After finding a HC, he received an official contract for the 2021 season. He tried to meet with the org to redefine his role as a GM that was satisfactory to him. Since they wouldn‚Äôt bunged he decided to leave.

He is happy of is time in the OWL with a lot of learning experience in all his roles. KDG was the first coach Albless called when he was searching for a HC. Barroi and Spazzo has been validated to stay in the coaching staff by KDG for the 2021 season so they will still be in the team. KDG was surprised that Albless was leaving.

Someone did an offer for a GM role from another team before he left, but because the new Defiant contract was so late, it was too late for him. He didn‚Äôt want to get into too much details. He doesn‚Äôt have any plan for 2021.

KDG is a really hard working GM. The day he was Okay-ed, he asked for all documents for any project and right away he was already preparing the team with the allotted budget versus the other team, how Defiant would be ranked with a specific roster, which team he could beat, the ones they need to upsets, making estimate, etc.

Toronto didn't give KDG unlimited budget. He has a budget and he gave the org a realistic expectation. It's a project that is not based on pure ambition, but it's instead grounded in logic. The budget for this year is also a lot smaller, Albless gave a 60% figure in comparison with last year. The plan for the roster is to have 8 players, maybe 9 depending on costs. The objective is to create synergy, ensure they have experience together and targeting a playoff qualification. They want to be a good team.

They said they plan on having all the players within the next month. And a lot of players are in the last stretch of negotiations.

About Zykk. He's a french player that Albless like a lot. He says that he's hardworking, willing to play a lot and improve constantly. Sadly, he didn't have a lot of time to show himself as capable for OWL, since as soon as he joined the team, the meta went to Genji comps/double hit scan hand while he's a projectile player. They also were against a lot of strong teams like Shock and Glads. It's unknown so far if he's coming back.

Albless left as the team was making trials, NA, EU, etc. so he doesn't have much information of where it is going. He gave recommendation for players before leaving, especially French players because he worked with them under Paris.

KDG like the kind of player that grind the solo queue, that keep asking for more. He doesn't want player that get tired quickly to play when the training days are too long. The project is to get players and grow them and give chances to young players. It's a long term project, thus they expect players to get better. Albless is saying that KDG interest Korean players a lot to play with him, it's a huge thing for the team. Once KDG was signed, Albless was receiving a lot more DMs from players, especially Koreans.

Last year goal for Toronto Defiant was to do some fan service and fill arenas. It was a success, but it wasn't a choice that was a competitive choice. Since there's no home stead anymore, they are putting more effort in making an actual competitive team with the available resources. Surefour and Nevix taking a break was known for a long time, and Albless claim it's important for them, because this year has been very harsh for all of us, but especially these veteran since they've been grinding since the very beginning. Something is said of Kellex, which I expect to be about him leaving Defiant and joining British Hurricane mid season.

It's now has been 2 years that Albless is involved in the OWL, he's been working at L.A with Eternal, and then Toronto with Defiant. Albless claim the quality that helped him a lot during these years is fast learning ability, and when he's motivated, he doesn't count hours working. He had a lot of great moment with people from both team, players, sponsors, org, etc. Albless is telling us about a time where the players had to be disciplined and he had to be 'bad cop'.

Since Albless had to be GM, he had to interact with the sponsors. During the Toronto Fan Appreciation Week, the players had to do two retweet for sponsors, and by Friday none had been done, and since nothing had been done. Basically, this morning the sponsors, the org, and other groups, started sending a lot of mails, DMs, etc. to him. Albless scheduled a meeting with the players where he make them understand what they had to do and they screwed up. Apparently, no players where late and they knew something wasn't right.

A player (unnamed, but it's not Kellex) requested to be traded during the year and leave back for his country. Albless was disappointed because he was there to build something with Toronto. He still gave his recommendation to organization to let him go, but they refused. The player was mad, but considering the situation, Albless had to work out a compromise with him to ensure the team would still workout. It was a really  complicated discussion to make everyone happy.

At the end of the season, Defiant decided to not exercise any of the options so any new players they sign, old like new, would be under the new 2021 contract version which give a lot more structure and flexibility to the organization. Now, if teams want to separate from a player, they don't have to pay him a full year, but they get to give him a prior notice before dropping him, instead of paying them the full year. Since the org also wanted that the HC would be fully responsible and able to choose his players, they give the option to every players to participate in the trial with the new coach. He think it was really hard for him, because he had to tell to all the players that their contracts were not guaranteed. He has a lot of empathy for players that goes to trial for OWL where they end up with only 2 players and they are not picked up after all.

Lilbow was dropped by the organization, apparently he was very young and they didn't agree with some things that he was doing, probably not as professional as they would have liked. Albless believe it could have easily resolved by a simple discussion. It's also the result of him not providing the results the org expected from this season. Albless is mad about it and claim if the people that took that decision were actually involved with the team day to day, they would have choose otherwise because they didn't see the work et had put into the team. He thinks it's been unjustified. Albless says Barroi was also shock by the news.

Since he's been free, he has been resting. He's planning on doing videos for now. Playing a lot of games.

Zaroid asked Albless when the new OWL season would be beginning, and it seems to be confidential information. He enigmatically said it would probably start after he turns 30 (he was born the 1st of April), 2 regions with worst division still, and an Invitational kind of event at the mid season.",1606780857

If he had an undissolved marriage when he married you, that made him a bigamist and , at best, you were a putative spouse. 

A divorce is only effective as to a valid marriage- here with wife #1. Yours would have had to be an annulment or a declaration that the putative marriage was void ab initio ( void from the beginning)

Your status as putative spouse or mistress was always subject to a legal analysis and unless it was part of the hush effort,your election of a title was ineffective.

Bottom line was that you cut a hard bargain and now people are trying to make you feel bad. Sounds like displaced accusations over your past behavior. It would not surprise me to learn that at some point someone established that you learned of or know of the first marriage. You knowledge changes things legally.

Yeah, yeah, IamaL and it so happens that I litigated something very close to this a number of years ago

"evolution","t5_2qhs7","The issue is partially dealt with here:  


&gt;Maximum sizes attained by living actinopterygians are much smaller than  those reached by chondrichthyans. Several factors, including the high  metabolic requirements of bony fishes, have been proposed as possible  body‚Äêsize constraints but no empirical approaches exist. Remarkably,  fossil evidence has rarely been considered despite some extinct  actinopterygians reaching sizes comparable to those of the largest  living sharks. Here, we have assessed the locomotion energetics of *Leedsichthys problematicus*,  an extinct gigantic suspension‚Äêfeeder and the largest actinopterygian  ever known, shedding light on the metabolic limits of body size in  actinopterygians and the possible underlying factors that drove the  gigantism in pachycormiforms. Phylogenetic generalized least squares  analyses and power performance curves established in living fishes were  used to infer the metabolic budget and locomotion cost of *L.¬†problematicus*  in a wide range of scenarios. Our approach predicts that specimens  weighing up to 44.9 tonnes would have been energetically viable and  suggests that similar body sizes could also be possible among living  taxa, discarding metabolic factors as likely body size constraints in  actinopterygians. Other aspects, such as the high degree of endoskeletal  ossification, oviparity, indirect development or the establishment of  other large suspension‚Äêfeeders, could have hindered the evolution of  gigantism among post‚ÄêMesozoic ray‚Äêfinned fish groups. From this  perspective, the evolution of anatomical innovations that allowed the  transition towards a suspension‚Äêfeeding lifestyle in medium‚Äêsized  pachycormiforms and the emergence of ecological opportunity during the  Mesozoic are proposed as the most likely factors for promoting the  acquisition of gigantism in this successful lineage of actinopterygians.

They know they are the IRS and they KNOW there is nothing we can do but be at their mercy. This wouldn‚Äôt be acceptable from any other business, and they shouldn‚Äôt be any different.

I just use his grabs and regular attacks, because even those do decent damage compared to lighter and faster characters, and most people don't seem to expect a Paul user to fight like that. As for Street Fighter, it's the movement and anything more complex than the fireballs that I find impossible. I always end up messing up with the stick and doing the fireball again instead of literally anything else, and if I try to block, I just slowly back away. A big part of my preference for Tekken is that the 3D movement allows me to dodge things more easily, and blocking being on a button instead of a directional input makes that easier as well. It's easier to avoid damage while closing in, and easier to counterattack if my opponent gets out of my combo. It's a matter of 2D VS 3D, not anything else. I'm really bad at 2D fighters.

"MauraMurraySub","t5_290pyk","While I don't think Carlode is Sharon, for various reasons I do think it's likely a member of the Rausch family. It seems silly to pretend otherwise. There are a few other ""fake"" accounts that point this way... one is clearly Sharon (IMO), but this account has never tweeted anything inflammatory. (And of course, there are non-Rausch accounts who feel Bill didn't murder Maura. I'm one of them.)

Now, this isn't a condemnation. There's no guidebook for ""my relative's girlfriend went missing 16 years ago, my family has been harassed for a decade over it, people think we're hiding things, another relative's suicide was dramatized on a blog, and now my relative is being accused of murder by an online mob."" My feeling is that it's a misguided attempt at trying to defend a loved one; it's a natural reaction. Especially when the ""other side"" has dozens of anonymous accounts slinging insults at your family on the regular.

But I agree it's not narrative steering - at least, no more than anyone else in this case steers. Which 95% of posters do. And I have to laugh when people say Bill/these accounts are trying to garner support for his trial. As if Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook are making the call to convict or not. I'm no lawyer, but I'm guessing all potential jurors will be asked if they're familiar with MM's case, and that a ""yes"" answer will disqualify them.",1606780859

Blackouts are a function of their TV deals, not a side effect of the streaming service.

When the NHL sells a network the right to broadcast games, they sell that network an *exclusive* right to broadcast that game in a specified market. This means that the network is buying not just the right to air/stream the game in that market, but also the guarantee that no one else can air/stream the game in that same market. That is why the TV deals are worth so much damn money: the NHL is essentially selling an in-market monopoly of their product to a broadcaster. The network is willing to pay so damn much because they know that they can charge a ton for their network since it is the only way to watch games in the area.

The blackouts on NHL.TV are a reflection of that exclusive right. It doesn't matter whether it is the NHL's own streaming service or a 3rd party service like DAZN. If the NHL started streaming the games in-market, they would be violating the existing TV deals.",1606780860

Grayscale offers the only way for investors to put their 401K, Roth IRA, and other accounts into crypto. So people are just typing in the trust‚Äôs ticker and buying it thinking they are buying Bitcoin Cash, and not understanding they are buying the trust that holds BCH.

"eupersonalfinance","t5_2w5jv","If you are interested in disruptive companies, [ARK Funds](https://ark-funds.com/) tracks them quite well. Unfortunately, their ETFs are not available to European clients, but you can view their holdings (the list for each ETF is available on their site) and pick your own basket of stocks.

Another riskier method to invest would be startup crowdfunding equity. One platform that facilitates this for South-Eastern European companies is [Seedblink](https://seedblink.com/). The most famous crowd investing platform is probably [AngelList](https://angel.co/), but you need to be an accredited investor (net worth minimum $1 million).

With crowdfunding you pick some companies that you like what they do and invest.  You need to take into account that the risk/reward ratio is much more binary than in regular stocks, so a company either takes off with great rewards or dies. You can't sell your equity as easily and the results usually come up in 3 years.",1606780860

Not everybody is cursed with being a half assed psychic like myself. A lot of people can't look at someone and go *I know that person* without them having to say anything, but a lot of water signs can, to an extent. A lot of us live on our intuition and don't always realize how many of the other signs are grounded only in what they can see and touch, so to speak.

Our communication is fluid and shifty because water is. It's constantly changing its shape because water molds to the space around it. Think about how varied water is in nature. It can be as subtle as mist or as destructive and in your face as a tidal wave.

Fire is fire and earth is earth. The wind might change directions, but it's still wind. Water can take a variety of different forms, leading to what I can only describe to you as a clusterfuck in terms of communication.

"Hardcore","t5_2qilj","On first listen, it's Hatebreed. I'll  have to continue with it to let the tracks grow on me, but I think the general sentiment of Hatebreed is that of Slayer. Slayer's Slayer and Hatebreed is Hatebreed. They haven't changed in forever and and found their niche, so they're good at what they do, but they're pretty much just sticking to that ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it"" formula. I think that works for a lot of bands. It works for Slayer, I don't really hate any of their releases, though if I'm listening to them, I tend just stick to Hell Awaits through Seasons in the Abyss and maybe another one or two later ones.

It's the same with Hatebreed for me. I've always looked forward to a new HB album, enjoyed all their releases just fine, but I tend to only listen to Rise of Brutality, Supremacy, and maybe another later album. With bands like Slayer and Hatebreed, you know it'll be fine, all you can hope for is that there will be some catchy songs on it and it won't be boring. The album's ok, nothing ground breaking, HB is showing their age in a lot of ways, the lyrics most noticeably. The subject matter, repetition, and lack of variety is what's annoying. Most of the time the subject matter is fine, and I know HB has always been empowering with their lyrics, but the real inspirational-core type shit is just super cringy. Their eponymous single Weight of False Self is the worst perpetrator of this on the album. The same, long, cheesy line repeated several times. 

But fuck it if I'm not excited for a new soundtrack to break shit in my house.",1606780862

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","&gt;But I‚Äôve also heard that the Witcher 3 is a brilliant game and I‚Äôm wondering if that game would be similar?

It is, yeah.  Like Skyrim, it's a massive open fantasy world (you don't get access to the whole world right from the beginning like Skyrim, though, it's got different regions that you unlock at certain points in the story) with a long main story and a huge number of sidequests to find.  It's third person rather than first person, and you play a fixed character with established motives, backstory, and personality rather than making your own character like Skyrim. 

Another difference is that it doesn't have as many really huge sidequest lines - in Skyrim some of the guild quest lines are almost as long as the main story, in the Witcher 3 there are a few long sidequest lines but most sidequests are one-off quests or smaller quest chains while the main story is very long.  It also does a very good job putting interesting choices in quests - even side quests that seem like basic fetch quests or monster kill quests usually end up being more than they seem, and it's rare to find a quest that doesn't include involve some sort of choice or moral dilemma.

Overall, it does differ from Skyrim in some ways, but if you're looking for another huge open-world fantasy RPG and are okay playing a pre-defined character instead of making your own, I'd highly recommend it.  It has its reputation for a reason.",1606780862

"worldpolitics","t5_2qh9a","&gt; üòû Try to crack a history book. This looks like The Troubles that Ireland had.

The Troubles didn't begin because a single candidate's ego would not let him accept the fact that he lost, resulting in his supporters grasping at straws for a way to victory that does not actually exist.

Although nice to know that you at least know that Trump's lies will lead to violence if they keep going.

&gt;If you think it's over, you are wrong.

The election is over. There is no rational reason to deny that at this point. 

What comes next is yet to be seen. Violence is certainly possible, as that sounds like a likely end result of Trump's current nonsense. 

&gt;But of course, anything i say you're for the opposite

If you had actual evidence for anything you have ever said instead of just grasping at straws and spamming this youtube channel (Also, is this your channel, or are you just a huge fan of their content?), that would be great.

And the reason we went to the BWE was to learn about Amari, Aperitivi and vermouths ... and the take away was, and I hope you can appreciate this, is that every region and maker does it differently... there are scores of varieties of each, so yes, we may have deviated from the original Roman recipe, but this is our Brooklyn version;)

"Coronavirus","t5_2x4yx","&gt; It's very clear that 70% of americans still think COVID19 is not real,

I think you are falling to the same type of disinformation you are projecting onto others.  It is not at all clear that 70% of americans think CV is not real.  Quite the contrary, the vast majority claim it is real.  Some mistakenly believe it is man made, some believe it is a conspiracy.  A large number *do* believe that governmental steps being taken are arbitrary and excessive, but that is by no means the same thing.

"SquaredCircle","t5_2sljg","Totally agree. Opie gets a bad rap because he's not as funny as the others, but he knew RADIO (He's been doing it since he was 18, as he constantly reminded people). He was the traffic cop that kept the show flowing - and like you pointed out knew what certain bits needed to get to the next level. Plus, ""Paralyzed Opie"" remains one of my all-time favorite radio moments.

After Patrice died, things fell apart for the show, obviously. I never took it as Opie wanting the ""funny guy spotlight"" - just they all grew apart personally and professionally. Opie got married and had kids and that became a big focus for him. Ant.... well, Ant didn't have anyone to sort of keep him in check (two of the biggest people to keep his theories and thoughts in check were Patrice, who died, and Bill Burr, who moved to California and wasn't on as much). Plus, life at the compound fed a lot of his itches. 

I listened the show since the mid 90s at WAAF, then would be the loser kid downloading the pirate shows off one of the file-sharing sites back in the old days and bought XM so I could listen to their debut show. Went to the Virus shows and everything. I miss those days, but happy to see them all doing something that makes them happy these days, even if it's apart,",1606780864
"wow","t5_2qio8","Definitely my preferred storyline so far because it reminds me a lot of Suramar. Not just the theme (Rebellion against Elite class stealing scarce resource etc.), but the fact that there is a raid related to the Revendreth storyline and not the other makes it so that I actually have something to look forward to here. 

I don't have any characters on other covenants so I don't know what's gonna happen in the other, but unless those storylines also lead into something more grandiose than just dungeons, Revendreth is definitely my favorite so far.",1606780864

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;I don‚Äôt quite understand what you mean when you relate wearing 2 different fabrics to serving two masters. 

Spiritual meaning. You know how in revelation every christian gets a white robe, well let's say during this life God can see you in your spiritual white robe, if you start living for this world you can mix two different spiritual cloths (one evil and one good). And you can't have both because nothing can be equal to God and you are putting this life on equal standings with God it can be seen as idolatry.

&gt;Divorce and remarrying being sins are religious beliefs (Luke 16:18) 

Yes and then there is the secular view of marriage. If you are religious and commit one of these wrongfully and see your sin you can just repent and be forgiven. If there is a specific example you want my opinion on please clarify. Such as domestic violence they do have a right to divorce since the abuser wasn't committed to the spouse in the first place.


&gt;As far as cursing goes where does it say that it‚Äôs okay if it doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone‚Äôs feelings?

If you are talking cursing like curse words which I'm pretty sure you are
Ephesians 5:3-4
[3]But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becometh saints;
[4]Neither filthiness, nor foolish talking, nor jesting, which are not convenient: but rather giving of thanks.
Proverbs 26:18-19
[18]As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,
[19]So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not I in sport?
Proverbs 11:12
[12]He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man of understanding holdeth his peace.


&gt;Many of these beliefs seem to be personal beliefs rather than things stated in the Bible. There are many more similar to these but they‚Äôre mostly in the Old Testament. I‚Äôve heard some say they don‚Äôt follow the Old Testament so I didn‚Äôt include them. I can include them if you‚Äôd like however

I don't follow all the old testament. Because some of it like ceremonial laws are not required by us anymore.

"NWSL","t5_2vt38","I agree with a lot of your points, but I'm not sure what you're trying to argue, and you end up giving Williams credit for everything she's accomplished while blaming others for all of her shortcomings. I think it's inarguable Ellis misused her and Vlatko is using her pretty well; I think it's a lot less clear that Riley stifled her like you are claiming. I think the easiest answer is that she is unbelievably good at creating chances with her speed in space, but mediocre at finishing. There's nothing wrong with that at all; she's a very good player. But I don't think you can lay it at Paul Riley's door; she's had plenty of time to improve her finishing and hasn't really. Even the low-percentage chances she takes with NCC are a lot of reps and shots on goal. If she could finish as well as she creates chances she'd be the best player in the world; if she created chances like she finishes she'd struggle to find a roster spot in the NWSL. In the end I think she's a very good, interestingly flawed player. I agree that team and coach context matters a lot for that type of player, but I don't think you can take that as far as you do without more evidence than we have that Riley's system hampered Williams' ability to develop a skill that it has always been clear she needs to improve and to date hasn't really been able to. I'm more inclined to think she is who she is, and argue about proper usage from there.",1606780864

Then why did you write that reply in the first place lmao. You're clearly full of shit and can't make a valid argument to support lockdowns. 

You can look at the data for your self. There is no significant increase in deaths compared to last year and prior years. Covid kills those who are already sick and most likely going to die anyway. That's what the data supports. We will see in a months time if America has had 300k more deaths that previous years. If you bother to look into it your self you will see that currently that's not the case, and it won't be by the end of the year.

Do you even know about the inaccuracies of the PCR testing?

I feel I gave a very good example with the Flag of Sandzak. When a person sees that flag they understand that it is a regional flag of Serbia but one that represents the Muslim majority of that region. It displays the ethnic, racial, religious make-up of the majority of people from that region whilst still preserving that national identity and integrity of the Nation (i.e Serbia). Albanians from Montenegro could do the same thing. Whereby when you see the new flag/symbol you would automatically understand that it represents Albanians from Montenegro as opposed to Albanians from Albania ( A completely different nation )

"TechnoProduction","t5_2v4k9","Although it was not my primary DAW, I used Reason a lot from versions 2 through 7.  Coming from a hardware-based studio, I found Reason very intuitive to learn after much frustration with Cubase SX.  Besides the virtual hardware workflow, a main selling point was the Reload application that converted Akai samples into a Reason format.  One of my dreams was to expand my Akai S-3000 collection to a rack of 16 units, but it was too cost prohibitive to actually implement.  In Reason, I was able to use my Akai sample collection with 16 NN-XT samplers, and it was awesome!

As stated, Reason is a great DAW for Techno music. However, it appears that Live, and to a lesser extent Bitwig, has captured a large portion of their user base over the past several years.

In spite transitioning back to a DAW-less workflow, I plan to upgrade to version 12 when it is released, as the software has come a long way since version 7.",1606780866

&gt; Two scientists in Moscow have proposed replacing the periodic table as the chief way to organize elements.

&gt; Credit for the periodic chart usually goes to Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev, who in 1869 arranged the 63 known elements in columns and rows according to their chemical and physical properties.

&gt; WHAT IS THE PERIODIC TABLE? The periodic table is a chart of known elements grouped by their atomic number, the number of protons in the nucleus of that element.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Hate fades through exposure and rational discussion.

This is absolutely false. Laughably false.

Hate is spread through platforming of those hateful ideas. It's propaganda, and we know from history that it works. No amount of ""rational discussion"" undoes the damage that is done by spreading that propaganda in the first place. Edit: To paraphrase u/JimboMan1234, who put it very succinctly, propaganda presents a unified, urgent explanation for the world‚Äôs problems, and it often validates what people wanted to believe in the first place. In contrast, the truth of the matter is usually more complicated and doesn't validate people's prejudices.

Propaganda needs to be debunked at best, preferably removed, but definitely not debated like it has any merit.

Deplatforming hate is very effective. We know this because we have seen it working. When hateful actors are deprived of their platform, they wither, and they cannot spread their message. Multiple hateful ""celebrities"" have faded into irrelevance over the last few years, after being denied their social media platform from which to spread their message.

&gt;That's how you change hearts and stop hate.

When someone comes here with a genuinely open mind, and it's *very* easy to see who is and who isn't, talking to them is fine.

But for hateful actors, changing their mind is not the desired goal. We cannot change their mind, they are here to spread a message, and to antagonise. The goal is to stop them spreading their hate to others.

Changing a hateful persons mind is an incredibly labour intensive task. It may even be impossible, especially for strangers on the Internet. And if you belong to the group the hateful person targets, it is likely also dangerous. In comparison spreading a hateful message is exceptionally easy, a quick post on the Internet can get seen by hundreds, or millions. Trying to change every hateful persons mind one-by-one is a losing strategy, preventing the spread of hateful ideology is a winning one.

Don't confuse our goals.",1606780868

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","&gt; I thought gay people were ""bOrN tHiS wAy""? 

You've clearly not spoken to a gay person. ""Born this way"" means born into this situation beyond their choice. It doesn't mean literally born with a magic gene that makes you gay.

It's only homophobic if you think they make that choice when they evidently don't.

&gt; I can't believe you're claiming that humans are born asexual 

Because that's true. Are you seriously claiming that children below 10 are sexually driven? 

&gt;  and that being gay doesn't mean you can't make children 

It doesn't typically inhibit people. Especially historically.

&gt; Children will eventually look for a mate to procreate with. 

So? Humans reach sexual maturity between 10 and 20. That's 10 years minimum for a sexuality to develop. What's before that? They obviously aren't looking for mates at very very young ages.

&gt; You haven't answered. 

Because it's a pointless question that isn't anything to do with the point. If you really need an answer, 0, obviously. Though I'm not sure why there's an 'and' there, because 2 men and 2 women could make a baby.",1606780868

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","Hello /u/idontfuckingknow178, if it's your first time with a new substance, check out the [**drug knowledge base**](/r/Drugs/wiki/knowledgebase) or use the search option to the right and then feel free to come back with any unanswered questions. You can find and share reports at /r/TripReports.

As a rule of thumb you should be looking to spend an hour reading (not asking questions) about any new drug you want to try. This may seem like a drag but it's really important because school education on individual drugs is awful and you obviously don't collect social knowledge like people do with alcohol. When you think that drugs can kill or disable you, suddenly it doesn't seem like so much to ask. 

You will get snippets of the important points from people here but nobody is going to be bothered to write out the kind of properly detailed guides that people have taken time to write and publish.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","Canada as well. Our rules of engagement are actually pretty strict on authorized retaliation.

We can only shoot if the target points their weapons at us, or makes it clear they intend to engage. Simply being in possession of a firearm is not grounds to fire upon them, they must also become hostile. 

For an example of this, let‚Äôs imagine for a moment that the Canadian military is called into the US for whatever unlikely reason you can muster. 

US citizens are legally allowed to own and posses firearms, so seeing a civilian with a gun isn‚Äôt grounds to fire upon them.

Canadian soldiers would have to first assess the situation, make sure the suspect isn‚Äôt hostile, and only be authorized to engage if the American pointed his gun at them, or made it 100% clear that he intents to use the gun on them.

If the American is not hostile, he‚Äôs allowed to have his gun near us and there would be no legal authority for us to engage.

Eliminating an unarmed civilian in a farmers field? Incredibly illegal! There is absolutely no justification.

I used the US as an example because of their gun rights. I can‚Äôt imagine an an actual situation where Canadian soldiers would have to be called in, even by request. The US military is more than capable of dealing with any threat, domestic or abroad.",1606780869

*****
&gt; Two scientists in Moscow have proposed replacing the periodic table as the chief way to organize elements.

&gt; Credit for the periodic chart usually goes to Russian chemist Dimitri Mendeleev, who in 1869 arranged the 63 known elements in columns and rows according to their chemical and physical properties.

&gt; WHAT IS THE PERIODIC TABLE? The periodic table is a chart of known elements grouped by their atomic number, the number of protons in the nucleus of that element.

So, what I usually do when I play for the grind, is to hop in the next unlocked vehicle, regardless if i really enjoy playing it or not, and try to unlock at least the good modifications.

It becomes kind of a cycle to me, and I never get to play much a vehicle I already unlocked a while back but really enjoy. 

I hope I made a clear explanation, but the point of my suggestion is: choose one or a few vehicles you enjoy playing, whether it's rank 1 or 5, and go have some fun in it, forget the grind for a while.",1606780870

"stopsmoking","t5_2rbuf","I think it's best explained in Alan Carr's book.
But the way I would sum it up after 13 years of smoking would be like that.
Smoking addiction consists of several components:

1. physical addiction from nicotine itself.  Comparing to other drugs it's relative harmless and goes away in 4 days or so, plus doesn't cause any real pain. But that's also making it very tricky. Nicotine in our body goes out very quickly,  so after an hour you start to feel craving,  that basically a withdrawal syndrome.  And since it's very light it can feel very organic like when you are slightly hungry or thirsty. Those things can easily be mixed up. I've relapsed several times just because I didn't put food in myself quickly enough  :) and because that lack of Nicotine is so familiar you can feel like you're having hardcore withdrawal symptoms even long after Nicotine left your body completely.  It can really caught you of guard or make you feel like you will always miss out on something. 

2. Habits. Smokers confirm this habits not only on daily basis but in many cases on hourly basis.  In that regard we are not much better than pavlov's dog - see trigger, do routine, get our dopamine. 
Every time you do routine the connection between triggers, action and reward in hour brain  gets stronger. Think of it as every time you do a routine you put a small thread between point A and B. And every time you ignore that trigger you remove one thread. Can you imagine how strong is this net of threads after daily smoking 20 per day for 10 years. It takes very long time to replace these connection and some cravings can be very hard to resist, like smoking whendrinkingor stressed,  because our brain willpower is already repressed in those moments.
In addition completely opposite situations or feelings can be triggers, boredom and stress,  happiness and sadness. In smokers brains sigarets helps him to relax or to get focused depending on situation. 
So basically what ever going on in your life it is a trigger for you. Even  warning signs on pack of sigarets is a trigger.  It is something that makes you worried and what every smoker does when he is worried? Smokes.

Quitting is marathon and you need to have a long term plan to survive it or even enjoy it. Another part of habits is that they can be seasonal, so it can hit you very hart if you're couple of months in your quit process and feeling like you have everything under control, when during chirstmas office party you start to feel same level of craving as your second day. It's very disappointing and hard to fight off. 

3. Just basic connection that a lot of smokers have with sigarets,  both what we told ourselves and what society told us. Quiting still has a connotations of giving up something precious, commiting a sacrifice even if consciously we understand that it's good for us. It's that deadly relationships when you can't live with it or can't live without it situation. No smoker will ever say that they want to smoke for the rest of their lives but the idea of never having another sigaret can give them panic attack.

Look at movies and other social culture elements, in many cases smoking shown as something desirable, last wish before death, sign of power and control. Your brain notice that and makes that connection.  Plus if you're a smoker for a long time it will be part of your identity.  It is the thing that's very hard to shake of as well.

Main idea that tobacco companies worked on this trap for 100 of years, perfecting it into something that is very hard to escape once you're in. The problem behind quitting smoking isn't one big thing that you can just power through and that can scare you off for the rest of your life like some really hardcore withdrawal processes from less socially acceptable drugs. Smoking is an intricate web of our habits,  addiction,  life style, social circles, years of building it, that in my opinion it is very hard to just cut your way out of there with will power alone.  It requires understanding of every small element,  planning for every possible scenario,  life changes in many ways,  trial and error, deep work with yourself and your beliefs. And worse part is somewhere down the line you might think that it wasn't such a bad experience and it wasn't as painful and you have control over it now and you can just smoke one. And you go back to zero again  

I know it's a bit messy but I've tried to explain in short what I've been learning about smoking and quitting for last 9-10 years. 

Hope it will help you to understand your mom struggle better and hopefully help her to become a non smoker in the future. At least it's good to see that you're trying to learn more instead of just blaming her for being weak in this struggle ‚ù§",1606780872

Q - What if I run out of minutes/texts/data in the middle of the 30 day cycle?

If you run out of your allotted credit per 30 day cycle, don't sweat, we don't charge pricey overages. However, you won't be able to use that specific service that was exhausted until your next 30 day cycle renews. So if you run out of minutes only, you could still text and surf the web. If you need more credit mid-cycle, we offer two options: a $2 and a $5 option.

$2 option: 100 minutes or 100 texts or 100 MB of data @ The Highest Speed
$5 option: 250 minutes or 500 texts or 250 MB of data @ The Highest Speed

The credit does not roll over cycle to cycle so if you add 500 minutes with two days left before your 30 day cycle is over, you will only have two days to use the 500 minutes.",1606780873

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;My point is that it is pushed as propaganda by some capitalists that everyone who is communist or socialist supports violent revolution, when this is just not true.

Marx wasn't some capitalist. 

&gt;This is because socialism doesn't necessarily have to follow the things laid out in the Manifesto. It doesn't even have to follow Orthodox Marxism!

Indeed. Which is one of the reasons socialism isn't as bad as communism. 

&gt;Furthermore, Marx lived in a different era - ideologies evolve and change. Just because Marx believed something doesn't mean socialists must follow that now.

Indeed. Which is one of the reasons socialism isn't as bad as communism. 

&gt;To be clear though, socialism doesn't have to happen by seizing the means of production overnight through revolution

I'm aware. The problem is that even the most benign form of socialism, probably anarch-syndicalism, still requires direct action that harms other people's property. Which is bad. And socialism by nature prevents people from owning the means of production personally, which is bad. 

&gt; and capitalist societies seize all sorts of things when there's a ""democratic mandate"" for it (which is often not even half of votes in support, let alone a majority of the viable electorate).

The government seizing things isn't a function of a market. It's a broadly capitalist state acting against capitalism. 

&gt;Communism is stateless, classless, and moneyless.

Stateless means anyone can do what they want because there are no authorities. 

&gt;That is not authoritarian.

Indeed. The first 10 seconds of a communist state might not be authoritarian. It's the time after that most people worry about. 

&gt;It might be utopian, but it isn't oppressive by nature, which was your original point.

My point is that by nature it will inevitably lead to oppression. And getting to a communist state is oppressive in nature. 

&gt;I am not pretending they are anything. I am stating what they are: umbrella terms, which you seem to be trying to reduce to narrow definitions so you can more easily defeat them as ideas.

I'm defining them as broadly as possible. They're still bad. 

&gt; Even people like Jordan Peterson advocate for doing the exact opposite.

Why would a take Jordan Peterson as a guide for anything?",1606780873

"Columbine","t5_2wh5j","I saw this question when I woke up today and I probably typed up four different responses before I had to sit on it. I spent the better part of today thinking of this question and my opinion on the matter. 

I in now way want to spark a religious debate and the following is just my personal views as a Christian. 

I‚Äôm confident they will be in paradise with their friends and families, including those they hurt directly and indirectly. This feels awkward to say because of the horrific nature of their actions on Earth, but I believe that all of our actions are directly the work of God. I believe our purpose on Earth is to experience the hardships not experienced in paradise. We must know suffering much like Christ suffered during the crucifixion. God has designed a Earthly existence that will prepare us to appreciate the kingdom God has prepared for us. I do not believe in Hell or that Lucifer has any power other than that God has given him. God‚Äôs plan is unfolding everyday and they were just fulfilling their part. A all knowing and all powerful God has predetermined every action and outcome from the genesis. 

Revenge and retribution are human emotions. Anger, fear and confusion as well. That is why I do not hate them and that is why it‚Äôs so powerful to forgive them here on Earth. I believe we are all in God‚Äôs hands and that if we trust in God, all things will come to be understood. 

I do not condone their actions. I wish it was not the case, but I believe there is much much more than this life and our experience here is just a stepping stone to God. There is so much pain in this life. This tragedy is just one example of that. It sent unimaginable pain and sadness across the globe, but much more love came from this than we can possibly know. 

I still dont feel like this fully explains my thoughts on this topic. But regardless, this life is important and temporary. You are part of God‚Äôs plan and you are just witnessing it all play out until the return of Christ to end all suffering by delivering us to his father‚Äôs kingdom.",1606780873

Use [Hoogle](https://hoogle.haskell.org/) get use to using types for searches.

And for the love of god if you see a blog post or video trying to explain to you what a monad is, *avoid it at all costs.* ([watch this instead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhuHCtR3xq8)).

Similarly, membrane transport as thought in biology 101, when they talk about active and passive transport, is a simplification of reality. The actual mechanisme is quantummechanical in nature.

That's just to say that 'inaccurate' descriptions can still be very usefull, especially when you're using it to construct an understanding of a larger concept, such as a skyscraper (when talking about newtonian physics), or a cell (when talking about membrane transport).",1606780877

"homeowners","t5_2r9c1","&gt; How many hardscape guys have you seen undertake walls without proper drawings/permits etc

Oh yeah it happens all the time. But if the contractor is going to give a flat rate quote, show proof of engineered documents, and calls the Code enforcer out to check and make sure its up to snuff, I dont see any problem with that. 

&gt; Also CMU retaining wall 6' tall?

I designed a 22-ft tall wall with CMU block a few months ago for a Wastewater plant. It was... beefy. CMU, rebar, and concrete are just so dang cheap compared to pre-engineered materials - although that wall had reasons to not be retaining-wall-blocks. Any mason can easily lay CMU without messing with geogrid, hauling off dirt to get the right backfill material, heavy machinery to haul around Big Blocks...so there is a big cost-savings there because you can go with a small company with low overhead. 

With pre-engineered blocks like VersaLok products, you are partially paying for the R&amp;D, as well as the engineering that those guys lump into the fee, and the better aesthetics. 

&gt; requiring a lot more excavation to resist the soil movement

Definitely true for tall walls. For a 6-ft wall, there would not need to be a massive heel on the footing. Maybe a 4-ft heel or so, depending on the soil conditions, which is probably what needs to be excavated for any residential retaining system

&gt;require additional inspections from the local building department 

Sure, but we are talking a few hundred bucks and it basically ensures the contractor is doing the correct thing. $4,000+$800 is a lot better than $10k

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, no need to run from the cheap contractor, but OP needs to make sure all his bases are covered and the contractor is not going to install a junky product that fails in 6 years when it rains for a week straight. Pre-engineered retaining wall blocks look a lot nicer and it would be my choice if it were my money and property",1606780877

"IsItBullshit","t5_2yhlm","No, it's not. Secondary sex characteristics are things that appear at puberty to indicate  puberty and fertility. Cellulite is an underlying pattern of fat distribution that becomes more evident as the skin loses elasticity with age and thus is no longer able to mask the underlying pattern of the fat that is beneath the skin. 

So first of all, cellulite is always there--it's the way fat is distributed. It becomes more visible when there is more fat and when the skin thins with age. Thicker skin masks the cellulite. Something that exists in people from birth can't by definition, be a secondary sex characteristic. It also exists in both men and women, which is something secondary sex characteristics don't do. And finally, since it tends to become more evident the older you are, meaning age 40+, rather than becoming evident at puberty, it doesn't fit the quality of being something that happens at puberty. 

That said, acquiring increased fat in the hips, thighs, and buttocks *are* secondary sex characteristics. Sometimes this means an increase in cellulite, since the more fat you have, the more likely it is to have visible cellulite. So basically, cellulite is an incidental trait related to percent of body fat and skin elasticity, that sometimes makes an appearance at puberty, but more often makes an appearance with older age, and it sometimes never happens at all.",1606780877

I don't get those people who come and attack you personally because you dare to criticize SW or recognize CW role in parenting. It's like a cult. I don't think SW was a monster, but I do think she's awful. CW is a fucking monster. 

Anyways, long rant over. I'm so sorry you're getting harassed for critical thinking. I'm incredibly appreciative this sub exists, especially the more time I spend here. I don't get why that's threatening to anyone, or why they have to make caricatures of us as extreme lovers of CW and haters of SW when that's clearly not the case. You're amazing, level-headed, logical, and I'm sure the vast majority in this sub support and stand behind you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è Stay strong SMIAC, they don't deserve your anger.",1606780878

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","And it's flight profile for such missions was to fly at tree level until the very last moment, because antiair would yeet it instantly. Even during the final attack run they considered the HMGs of soviet tank commanders to be a serious threat that could easily take out an A-10.

And the reason the A-10 carries GBUs and AGMs is, that the GAU-8 is useless against soviet MBT armor IRL, even with DU rounds. To achieve reliable penetration the A-10 would go into the dive from heights and angles of attack that would make it childs play for AA to take it out.

People really overestimate the value of the A-10 in actual combat scenarios against even moderately equipped enemies. Everything the A-10 can do, other planes can do better. Especially the F-35. The best thing the A-10 can do is loiter in uncontested or very low threat areas. Which can also be done by other planes with comparable efficiency (even the F-35) but better target hit capability. Or it can be done by drones, which outperform the A-10 in loiter time by magnitudes.

The BRRRT is a feel good thingy, but that's about it. The US does need a plane to replace some of the roles the A-10 fills, but those would be prop planes similiar to the A-29.",1606780878

Your point was that economic activity was going to shift to the continent and result in additional tax receipts for the EU27.

I don‚Äôt know how financial institutions are going to structure their tax affairs, but the winners from Brexit so far seem to be Dublin and Luxembourg, not Paris and Frankfurt, judging by the way the financial services industry is adapting. Coincidentally, these happen to be the jurisdictions where you could pay very little, and with clever planning no, tax.

Cheapest place is probably bunnings - you can buy it in various dimensions for dirt cheap, though probably the thinnest would be 20mm (i think beer crates would be more like 10mm). If you've got access to a table saw, it'd be simple enough to resaw a strip in half.

I'm guessing you can get 100x20 for about $3/meter, which resawn to ~10mm would be about $1.50/meter.

It's not typically listed on their website - but will be out in the lumber yard somewhere.",1606780882

What Chappelle is really talking about here are *values*. You can move towards values. You can try to live a life aligned with your values. You cannot ""achieve"" a value, it is something that guides you. 

The threat he is describing regarding ""better or worse"" vs ""good and bad"" is people who allow their values to be supplanted by other people's values. If I cede my decision making process to you and you provide me with two options: I can choose the lesser of two evils, but I have no guarantee that either option will be aligned with my values. The best I can do is select the choice that will make me feel the least ashamed of myself.

Chappelle is saying it is important to identify what your values are and strive to live a life that is aligned with those values. To be able to measure the success of your decisions by how aligned they were with your values, rather than how much shame they induced in you for settling on a path that wasn't in line with who you want to be.",1606780883

December tomorrow? In some ways it‚Äôs surprising. Where does the year go? ‚ÄúAs sand through the hourglass, so are the days of our lives.‚Äù &lt;smile&gt; December! Christmas and possibly snow in the same month. That‚Äôs special! Indeed. 

Congratulations on getting your tree up! Your tree sounds a lot more complex than mine. Your tree smells real? Well, that‚Äôs awesome. The scent lasted 25-30 years. That‚Äôs truly impressive. ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt make them like that anymore!‚Äù &lt;laugh&gt; Mine doesn‚Äôt smell so I got some candles to mimic the pine scent. Not the same, but it‚Äôs works for us. Sounds like it‚Äôs similar for you, artificial tree works just fine. Lights, ornaments, the works! Festive. 

ABBA is great. I‚Äôm thankful for their revival. It was fashionable to hate on disco music. Yes, there are lots of examples. I‚Äôm not always expressive about my opinions; it‚Äôs easier to evaluate the room and than decide whether to say anything or not. Sometimes it‚Äôs not worth sharing when I have a different view. You‚Äôre right that I am ... hiding perhaps ... to keep the peace. When the issue is important, I speak up. I‚Äôm a bit difficult to get to know sometimes, I admit. Not with you though. I feel safe with you to share my thoughts. &lt;hug&gt; Thank you.  I have work to do to open up &amp; express my opinions with others. &lt;nods head&gt; Yes, I‚Äôm still growing. 

Thanks for the toast! &lt;takes bite&gt; Yes, super delicious. I saved my coffee for you. &lt;slides mug to you&gt; All yours! &lt;laugh&gt; I‚Äôll get your next pot of coffee started. &lt;coffee perking, smells great&gt;

Love to the Missus and the pets. Stay warm.

Love you Dad,
Sunshine

What they leave out is the archeological finds since them and the knowledge gained from those finds and more recent discoveries. 

https://answersingenesis.org/mammals/giraffes-towering-testimonies-to-gods-design/

The creationists arguments are circular. They begin with the premise of a creator and end with the theory of a creator. They use only the evidence that supports their preconceptions and dismiss those that don‚Äôt fit within that idea stream and so it‚Äôs flawed from the start. 

Whereas, science begins with observations and follows the evidence they have and find. They use the scientific method. 

The scientific method has five basic steps, plus one feedback step:
Make an observation.
Ask a question.
Form a hypothesis, or testable explanation.
Make a prediction based on the hypothesis.
Test the prediction.
Iterate: use the results to make new hypotheses or predictions.

If any of the steps leads in a different direction, they change the hypothesis. All steps must be testable, verifiable, and reproducible.",1606780884

Sorry. I'm generally overly honest, so I told the story exactly as I remembered and experienced it, which included emotions because I am a very emotional person, and it was a very emotional experience. That's how I tell all stories.

I feel bad for you, that a well told story triggers your ""this guy is lying"" reflex. Reddit is filled with stories about crazy fucked up shit happening to normal people, and it's full of stories of regular people doing badass things. You don't have to believe anything I say, people disbelieving me doesn't change my past, but it's sad to think that so many stories and experiences get dismissed out of hand, because the person reading just can't handle things happening to others that don't fit within their own views of what can happen, or how people should be talking about what has happened.",1606780885

But lets get it going. Galactica's main role in its series was the protection of the Civilian Fleet. This meant it had few opportunities to go on the offensive and show us what it could do. Here in this scenario, it has a safe harbor for the Civilians they can shovel through. They also got a star fix with which to send the Janus and Berzerks with the larger civilian ships to the 13th Tribe, leaving Adama with the Adamants and a few essential civilians ships to wage Guerilla Warfare with the Empire providing replacements. Once Pegasus joins up, Empire Wyvern Knights start making up a large portion of Viper and Raptor Pilots. With Pina Colada and her girlfriends even getting some training from Starbuck. Galactica's Crew also gets chances to R&amp;R on the 13th Tribe's Homeworld where they meet catgirls, bunnygirls, etc, but also draw the attention of Rory Mercury who makes it her mission to seduce Lee Adama. Another thing, Lee is not CAG here, Dipper survives and is Galactica's CAG with Lee transferred to one of the Adamants as a Squadron Leader.

Meanwhile the Janus Group after 8 months hard travel, comes across scout Raptors from the world of the Empire and jumps in to form the Orbital Guard as the Empire really kicks into gear exploiting its Solar System.",1606780885

However a few small fixes:
Instead of ""atypical"" I would use the word ""uncommon""
""Of course it wasn't uncommon of her to forget about her own house.""
Also incorrect tense of ""forget""

And the final sentence ""She regarded it's every tool and every moment as unfit.""

But it would be good to just finish that thought with ""unfit for..."" Her attention? Her time? Her effort? That's up to you, just a little incomplete.

Both of you have done well, it sounds interesting, I would like to know what the rest of the story is.

Other vaccines and medications need to be kept as cold, they work fine. Not all the vaccines being made need such extreme refrigeration.

Your post was removed due to the New/Inactive User filter. This is in place due to how large the subreddit is, and with that bringing hordes of spam/reposts/advertising etc...

The filter removes posts from accounts that have less than 500 karma and that are less than 2 weeks old.
What you need in order to post (YOU NEED BOTH OF THESE):

* 500 combined post &amp; comment karma (award karma DOES NOT COUNT)

* Wait for your account to be 2 weeks old

You can get karma by commenting on posts or posting in other subreddits and getting upvotes on either (Reddit's version of likes).

Directly asking people for upvotes isn't allowed, and you will be banned for it.

**If you message modmail about this you will be ignored, if you don't understand something then google it.**

Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions is a satirical novella by the English schoolmaster Edwin Abbott Abbott, first published in 1884 by Seeley &amp; Co. of London. Written pseudonymously by ""A Square"", the book used the fictional two-dimensional world of Flatland to comment on the hierarchy of Victorian culture, but the novella's more enduring contribution is its examination of dimensions.Several films have been made from the story, including the feature film Flatland (2007). Other efforts have been short or experimental films, including one narrated by Dudley Moore and the short films Flatland: The Movie (2007) and Flatland 2: Sphereland (2012).

I think that most traits of good leaders are not dependent on their technical knowledge, but rather how they deal with disparity in that technical knowledge. You dont want a team lead who is wildly technical but doesnt upskill the test of the team, just like you dont want someone who is non-technical who micromanages the team.",1606780888

"depression_memes","t5_3e93l","    There is a number of good ways to respond, and as previously mentioned, your relationship to that person should guide you.  Offering emotional support or a person to talk to may be helpful, although if you aren‚Äôt terribly close it may not seem appropriate.  If you are socially acquainted, an open-ended offer to grab coffee or lunch could show them that you would like to hang out, and therefore that texting or calling you up is NOT an imposition (many people with mental illnesses tend to feel they are a burden), but that you won‚Äôt push them to get together when they are not feeling up to it.  Truly, there are many gestures that can help a depressed person feel valued or supported that are actually quite simple. 

    In my opinion, it‚Äôs more important to know what not to do.  First off, being insistent that the person should take part in an activity when they are not feeling it can make them feel overwhelmed, and maybe even like they are failing you or others.  Many well-intentioned friends or family put undue strain on a depressed person in this way, without even realizing it.  
    Additionally, there are certain kindly meant things people say that can do a lot of damage in the worst case, and even in the best case are highly unlikely to be helpful.  Such things may include, but are not limited to, the following sentiments:
    1) a lot of people have bigger problems
Or, alternatively 
    2) just think of all the blessings in your life/look on the bright side of things

    3) you just have to choose to be positive/positive thinking is the key
    4) there are therapies/pills/healthy habits that will help you
    5) you should do what X person does, it works
    6) you just have to try harder 
    7) it‚Äôs not that difficult to just get out of bed/go to work/prepare dinner/fall asleep/whatever else

Every person is different and every interpersonal relationship has a different dynamic, so these suggestions are by no means one-size-fits-all;  I‚Äôm just going on my own experiences and those of my close friends.  The key issues with statements like the above are the failure to acknowledge the validity of the person‚Äôs struggles, that they ignore the reality that mental health is a medical issue rather than a simple aggregate of conscious thought and fleeting feelings, and that they imply that the person has not taken obvious steps to improve their wellbeing.  Chances are, they know a great deal more about their options for treatment than you do.  They are trying; they are doing the best they can with the often impossibly difficult task of seeing past their pain.  

   Sorry, I know I wrote a friggin‚Äô novel, but since you asked, I imagine that you want to know, and that you are one of those kind souls who really cares, and hopes to help.  So I wanted to give you something real.  Once again, everyone goes through these things differently, and some people may disagree with what I‚Äôve said.  The most important things are to consider the individual you are speaking to, and if you still aren‚Äôt sure, ask them.  If you care to help and don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôre going about it the best way, ask them.  Let them guide you.  Only they truly know what they are dealing with.",1606780888
"Pathfinder_Kingmaker","t5_idyrj","You don't even need the cleric present, just keeping a few scrolls on hand with experience using divine scrolls, would be enough(probably a prudent precaution for any ruler in Golarion to keep such a scroll at hand really).  Having said that creative truth telling might still obscure the truth enough for Tartuicio to get away with it for a while(e.g. answer the question of who the spy is with someone else is a spy, and since he has co-conspirators he is not lying, just omitting the detail about being one of many spies, then when asked if he thinks you are the spy, answer that you'd be a terrible spy if he knew about it),which would have been great writing since it shows the player that Tarts is a capable manipulator.",1606780888

What percentage fewer depends on the mask material.  There are reasons that have been explained why this works, but the bottom line is that test after test has proven this.  You might find somebody spouting a scenario why masks don‚Äôt prevent virus from spreading, but I have found zero test results that back this up.  This is the difference between science and bullshit.

What about CO2 killing the mask wearer?  Again, you have two schools of thought.  One is that you will breath less oxygen and more CO2, and your health will be at risk.  Zero tests have validated this.  All tests have shown that your blood oxygen remains at normal levels while wearing a mask for extended periods of time.

We had 2-2-5-5 originally. I just kept documenting and documenting. I never talk to my nexh on the phone and don't listen when they try to talk to me always through our coparenter app. I am still doing EMDR treatments from all the trauma. However every day is brighter now. Your kids deserve you, the sane parent. You have to hang in there. It is very hard, but u need to do it for the kids. I wanted to give up too. Fricken covert narcs. Never evidence. Listen to how they answer a  question in a calm tone: vagueness, complete lie/attack, change subject.  Can be mind boggling in mediation.  

You can do this. Any consolation that my kid was mad at me for getting primary custody.  3 weeks later and they are much better.  I have not seen them happier.",1606780889

"detroitlions","t5_2rynx","I could see this going either way.

On one hand - the Lions aren‚Äôt just a good head coach and a draft away from being contenders.  Patricia has run out a lot of the talent on this team, and replaced them with expensive, less talented options.  There are a lot of holes on this team, I could see a new head coach be potentially way better at optimizing talent and developing talent, but man does this defense look bad.  And the offense just simply doesn‚Äôt have the firepower to overcome that. 

I could see them potentially completely ripping the band-aid off, trading Stafford, gutting this team, and starting a long and painful process.

On the other hand - Stafford‚Äôs stock is admittedly low right now.  I don‚Äôt see it getting a lot better with Bevell, and I‚Äôm still not buying that he‚Äôs 100% healthy this year either.  I think Stafford could be an excellent mentor, and get traded before the deadline next year if things aren‚Äôt looking like he‚Äôs got a shot at doing something groundbreaking with the Lions.  

If they miraculously turn things around, I don‚Äôt see why you don‚Äôt ride it out with Stafford and continue to groom someone behind him.  This unfortunately doesn‚Äôt seem highly likely, only because you‚Äôre not going to waste early first round capital to sit on the bench for two years, and the likelihood of you bagging untapped superstar potential at QB in rounds 3 and later is too few and far between.

Either way, be prepared to buckle up - this might take a while.",1606780890

If you mean instead abortion=kill (the fetus dies but there is no judgment of depravity on the woman) then that is different.

First of all, background. I'm 16. My parents make me and my little brother decorate the Christmas tree every year by ourselves. We both don't really care about Christmas, and I find literally no value in decorating a tree that already has lights on it. I understand it's supposed to be some sort of bonding activity, but it always ends in argument and is overall best left to the parents if they want it so bad.

This year has been pretty bad. I'm behind on schoolwork, and I've been working on catching up since I missed a few days of school. I have several hours of work I need to do. My mom texts me and says that I have to decorate the tree. I say I have things to do. She then tells me to again, I respond by saying I have no interest in a decorated tree. She then texts back ""Listen. That is totally and completely shitty. DO NOT ask me for anything ever again."" And dad texts 10 minutes later about how horrible we are for not decorating a fucking tree. Now I'm sitting here having and am extremely guilty because I didn't decorate a goddamn tree for one year. AITA?

I'm a structural engineer and have worked with a few people who have designed and built their own modifications. However, generally I'd recommend that you use an architect if you aren't either a surveyor or engineer / know your way around the regulations and laws.

There are issues around planning law, insulation, ventilation, access, fire safety, building control law, structure etc etc which architects can guide you on. Plus they know what works and shouldn't forget anything important. Professional fees can feel like money for not much but if they save you one or two big bills then they've paid for themselves. 

That said, I didn't use an architect for my 2 storey extension but I did get free advice from the ones I work with quite a lot.

Edit - the usual process is

architect plans, usually some back and forth. Useful to have the opinion of an engineer but not vital. Find and work out how drains, electric and gas will work 

When happy apply for Planning permission (if needed) and start a building control application. They sometimes raise issues with fire or structural safety

Ideally you eventually will have cards that are *only* Chinese, but I think English on front is ok in early stages to test production skills. I think it's fine, the only issue is when you see a word in English that can be translated a bunch of ways into Chinese. Overall I think it's fine, though if you accommodate yourself producing a synonym (I usually just mark myself as good if I produce a synonym, this is not ideal but it works)

~~I've never heard of someone suggesting you shouldn't have TL on the front. I'd be curious what their reasoning is, because either they're insane or have hit some groundbreaking discovery that'll drastically change the way we think about language learning.~~

With everyone in tow, I finally made it to Pewter City. I try exploring a little, but it doesn't seem like there's much right now, especially with the entrance to Route 3 blocked off. That, I did not remember. I check out the Museum as well, but again, there's *nothing*. Welp, there's a waste of $50.

With that though, there's nothing left except for the Gym.

Up first is Camper Liam, who's easily swept aside by Pacino's flurry of Karate Chops and Low Kicks.

***VS Leader Brock***

&gt;I send out Caesar as Brock does a Geodude; a single Vine Whip, and it's down. Next came his Onix, who struck a Rock Tomb upon Caesar, doing a bit over a third in damage. Fortunately, another Vine Whip felled the rocky snake.

Woohoo! First gym down, many, *many*, more to go. It was a pretty calm ordeal, and just the start I wanted.

# Extra Thoughts

* I was reminded rather quickly that this generation's poison mechanics don't spare my friends' lives at 1 HP. Got to keep this in mind for the rest of the adventure.
* Leech Seed seems to make Caesar nigh unkillable, and if I remember correctly, he gets Sleep Powder soon as well. That should be a fun stall set to play around with, and fall back upon if there's ever a need.
* Grinding here is... *so* tedious. I'm so thankful for my emulator's speed-up function, which also makes me really respect the time and effort people playing on consoles put into Nuzlockes.
* I noticed a Cut Tree blocking off another entrance to the Pewter City Museum? Does anyone know what purpose this has, and whether its worth coming back to?
* Hope everyone enjoyed reading this! If there's any feedback at all you have for this sort of update style, feel free to message me. eg. Should I make it more concise, or is this length fine?

Note there are no arguments put into play( ).

A very helpful thing to do would be looking up what play takes in in the docs, play takes in a float (decimal number) that tells what place in the stream to start. Eg: play(2) starts playing at 2 seconds in, rather than the beginning.

If you want to change the stream, you'll need to do something like $Audio.stream = load(""res://path/to/sfx.wav"")

I use 30% sens, 100% range, 800dpi, on 1080p (VR related resolution scaling will change the relative sensitivity, VR mouse controls are broken atm).  That sets the vjoy cursor track speed (sensitivity) close to what I'm used to in FPS games so I know what kind of cursor reaction to expect from mouse movement, but the large motion range spreads that input out to have much more granular control within that sensitivity speed.  You WILL lose track of the vjoy cursor with the large motion range, but it feels so much more natural to me like this, where very large forearm level movements are immediately translated into max deflection but smaller FPS palm heel flick-like motions are not, and can be used to aim effectively, with the vjoy cursor still tracking at a speed I'm used to.

Again, as you build up muscle memory, you'll stop paying attention to the vjoy cursor anyways.  But yeah, options would be nice to learn with.",1606780896

I mean, sure, a slice of carrot is carrot, no two ways about it, but it is not A carrot, and fries are potato, yet they are not potatoes.

A potato is a root vegetable, a lump of starches, and a fry is a derivative of said potato. Sure, the fry is made from the potato, but as you‚Äôve now turned the potato into fries, you haven‚Äôt made potatoes, you‚Äôve made fries.

I think an honest assessment of his time in office paints a positive picture of a surprisingly progressive Republican governor:

1. He was the only Republican governor in the U.S. who embraced the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and instead of suing the White House, directed his own administration to immediately implement the law
2. He was more of an environmental champion than both of his successors. He signed AB 32 into law, the most aggressive mandate for greenhouse gas reductions in the country (maybe the world).
3. He expanded access to banking services for low-income Californians who previously only relied on check cashing and high interest payday lenders.
4. He was the main backer of ballot measures to end gerrymandering (it's now handled by an independent citizens commission) and party primaries (all candidates for office now run on the same primary ballot, and the top two move to the general election, even if they're from the same party).",1606780897

I guess what I‚Äôm saying is that sometimes you just have to trust what a professional in a specialty tells you.

I graduated valedictorian in high school, had around a 3.7 GPA in undergrad, and a 3.9 GPA for my MBA. However, I think the reason that I was able to be successful in school is because I loved learning new things so my adhd was actually an advantage because I would get so focused.

Depends on the school. Many public universities don't even give aid to out-of-state domestic students, let alone international students.

You are probably familiar with the concept of a 'paradigm shift' right? It's associated with a philosopher of science called Thomas Kuhn, who wrote a book called 'the structure of scientific revolutions' in the 1950s. Basic gist is, intellectual thought is a series of consensuses, one consensus after the next, and when you have a consensus it's really difficult to criticize it until the criticism just becomes so overwhelming that it bursts out like a geyser and the whole system fucking explodes. 

So, think of CA simping/fanboyism/cuckery as a kind of consensus, here on this sub. Yeah sure right now we're all criticizing CA, because the resentment and annoyance at these little problems has just continued to grow and grow and now it's exploding. But before this, I'm telling you man, if you criticized either the company or the product (or God forbid, the employees) you'd get fucking buried with downvotes and I deleted a lot of my old comments due to this; it's just embarrassing if someone I know checks my posts and sees me at -200 for saying something about a game they know I like.",1606780898

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","This website offers short guides that go over the basics: [improveyoursocialskills.com](https://www.improveyoursocialskills.com/learn-social-skills)

You have to study [social psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology) in general:

&gt;Social psychology is the scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence of others

and [interpersonal phenomena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_psychology#Interpersonal_phenomena) specifically. You can read about all the fields on wikipedia, generally anything psychology is well documented there.

There's also a non academic field and it's called Social Engineering. [Lifehacker has a whole segment](https://lifehacker.com/tag/social-engineering) dedicated to it.

[Here's a currently popular book on it.](https://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-Art-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539)

You don't really *want* to be a social engineer (though you might), but it's just that the unwritten rules of nonverbal communications are clearly written down and that's what you are really after.

There is also good book on this topic was written about 100 years ago and it's called [""How to win Friends &amp; Influence People""](https://www.amazon.com/How-win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/8189297813/) ([Audiobook on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzBE3tAYLCE)). It's still very popular.

Then it would be helpful if you could practice walking up to people and talk to them, so you can see what approach works for you and what doesn't work. Obviously such a thing doesn't exist. However, there is something that's very close to it and that's [Toastmasters](https://www.toastmasters.org/). You might think, ""what does public speaking have to do with social status?"" Well, they'll train you into talking to people you don't know, they'll teach you ad hoc speaking and they'll give you feedback if you have body posture, eye contact or other non-verbal communication issues. On top of that [there are clubs pretty much every where](https://www.toastmasters.org/find-a-club), it's cheap and free to visit the first few times. They are also *very* tolerant towards odd or socially awkward people.

It takes a while to really get a hang of it. I'd say at *least* a year of daily learning and practice (it depends of course, not everyone masters this at the same rate). It's a combination of studying, trying, studying again, looking for the signs, trying to copy them or act on them. So don't give up if it doesn't pay off within a month or two, just keep learning more, find your own sources (there's a lot more literature about these topics out there than what I gave you, what I gave you is just the tip of the iceberg).",1606780899

Odin in the top middle is obvious

next to him on the right is that sif? I cant really tell but i suspect her because

I believe thats thor on the top far right, not sure about this one either. The thing he is holding could be mj√∂lnir and the helmet might present him as a warrior...

on the left next to odin, is that frigg? I really don't know but it would make sense to place her next to odin. 

On the top far left, i am completely lost, but my wild guess would be Heimdall. Edit: i could have seen thor in this one too but i thought i was the one on the right.

In the lower row, the far left I don't know if this is to represent a certain god or something else.

Next to it, I'm lost again. Could that be skadi? I don't know any other godess associated with hunting/a bow *and* a dog/wolf. (At first i was like ""yeah thats artemis"" but she isn't part of the norse pantheon)

In the middle in the lower row, i would again guess frigg? She is the godess of notherhood, right?  But two friggs? Maybe one of them is freya, but they both have a child... I start to suspect the one on top might be freya with her brother frey as the boy, but i thought they were twins.

Then I'm certain on the next one, the second on the right of the lower row has to be nj√∂rd, the flowing wavy beard and the waves at his feet are a dead giveaway. (I find it strange that you didn't place skadi next to him since they were married).

And the godess on the far right on the lower row is also very obvious, that is hel with her two faces.

And they involve the body disfunctioning, so you also need to understand how the body functions in the first place. Protein structures, genome knowledge, gene expression in health and disease, chromatin accessibility, protein-protein interactions, catalytic mechanisms and many more basic structural and functional informations are all important data that provides a framework for whatever biologists do. 

Say you have a patient with a weird unknown genetic disease, you want to understand how it works. You sequence, you find dozens of thousands of point mutations and alterations compared to the reference genome, you need a whole lot of knowledge and databases to hypothesize what's going on and devise experiments to confirm a mechanism and propose a fix. 

It could one day also help design antibodies in silico instead of immunizing animals and isolating clones, and that might lead to more personnalized e.g. cancer treatments (a notorious case for which every patient presents with different protein alterations). 

On a different note, understanding and manipulating biology/proteins can give other cool stuff than medicines: biofuels, help preserve ecosystems, work on enzymes that degrade plastic waste, make new organic materials, replace dirty old school chemistry relying on solvents and harsh catalysts with green enzymatic reactions etc.

Another thing that I forgot to mention in my first comment was the way they handled elective surgery. Fair enough that they panicked and wanted to make sure they were prepared for what might come. 

But the hospitals were dead for months. And people waiting on elective (so anything that isn‚Äôt to stop you dying immediately) surgery have had to wait around in chronic pain because people who should have been prepared didn‚Äôt give a rats ass until it was absolutely necessary",1606780900

"realmadrid","t5_2rr0e","Vini needs a loan to a team where he handles less pressure than in RM (IMO a Bundesliga, Ligue one or a mid table team of la liga).

Thankfully there is numerous teams that could use a fast winger like Vini, such like:

In Bundesliga: Leverkusen, Stuttgart or Hoffenheim.

Ligue one: Lille, Bordeaux, Monaco, Rennes

La liga: Betis or Valencia

Prem: Southampton

In any of those teams I reckon he could get minutes, a suitable tactical system and least amount of pressure of doing everything up to RM standards. If I had to choose I would send him to Ligue one or Bundesliga those are competitions where spaces are more open and some of those play with fast transitions.",1606780900
"movies","t5_2qh3s","7 was one of the most lazily written movies Ive seen yet. Instead of making teh characters interesting it asks us: ""but to what of your favorite characters is this conected to?"" with a bunch of mystery boxes that dont add anything to the  story and  are just there to hype and make fans overlook problems

8 was a mostly poorly executed bunch of good  ideas and a bunch of also poorly executed boring ones. While a lot of  people didnt watch TRoS because of TLJ, I think that  TLJ sets up the next movie really well with a compelling conflict beetwen Kylo and Rey and a  fight the resistance cant brute  force  through.

9 is a rushed  mess that tries to retcon half of 8 and tell a really overcomplicated story in the safest  way possible with terrible pacing and often hilarious lines",1606780900

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","You mentioned Vajrayana and a cult that utilizes Buddhism in their indoctrination tactics. 
I guess my question here is that, ""Is it legit Vajrayana?""
There are so many frauds and fake Gurus or Lamas out there that you have to be careful what you get involved with. Even in Asia there are fake monks and some of them travel to the West because they know that Yoga and Buddhism can be big money makers if monetized properly. 

 What I know from Buddhist training is that it takes years of foundation before one receives the Vajrayana in most cases. The Vajrayana system is viewed as upper level Buddhist indoctrination and most people unless born into it will usually study Mahayana or a similar practice for 5 years or longer before being invited to learn Vajrayana. I myself studied a little Theravada and Mahayana for a combined 9 years and was invited by the Lama to study Vajrayana in which the last 2 years was a preparation process where I practiced Buddhism in a Temple setting 7 days a week for 2 years straight practically breathing Buddhism 24 hours a day. 

Vajrayana is the upper levels Tantras of Buddhism and general will be difficult to grasp if there is no foundation to support the advanced wisdom and techniques. 

I don't personally know you and do not want to make any assumptions or have a predisposition on you or your former romantic partner however if you would have said, ""I studied Nyingma for 12 years then was invited to study Vajrayana for 3 years and transitioned over the Kagyu and am now studying Karma Kagyu"" or ""I studied Mahayana for 3 years and then was introduced to Vajrayana from the Lama"" it would sound more realistic to me. In other words I question the cult leader's Buddhist knowledge and to me it sounds like this person received his education from solely books and never directly from a Lama or Buddhist family. However, Buddhism can be studied by everyone and people can learn from books although it's best to have to guidance of a legitimate instructor. 

As for what you should do: Heal. 
Leave him behind and move on. 
If you want to continue practice then pick up a book, build your altar (if you don't already have one) and apply the philosophy in ritual and life. When you feel comfortable then seek out a legitimate Temple that will allow for you independence and freedom to be who you are and doesn't twist dharmic law to suit their own agenda. 

As for systems I would start over and build back into Vajrayana practice. 
Personally, I recommend Pure Land Buddhism. 

Some others you could study in your case is Mahayana, Kagyu (Tibetan) or if you are seeking something completely different then Zen. 
If you are seeking something less mystical I would recommend Theravada; it can have supernatural aspects to if the school studies the Abhidharma although Theravada tends to feel more minimal and stripped down than other forms of Buddhism.

If I were you I would either start with Mahayana or Pure Land Buddhism and take it easy for awhile so that you have time to heal. Use the Buddhism to heal yourself and get into a relaxing Pure Land practice before transitioning back into a regular Vajrayana ritual. Get a grasp of Buddhist praxis at the fundamental level then if you feel it is necessary incorporate the Vajrayana in again. Although you might have to restudy Vajrayana all together if what you learned by your previous Guru was bogus.",1606780900

"Surlybikefans","t5_358z5","Frame weight doesn't really matter for this. 

I'd recommend a different rear wheel instead of rebuilding yours, so that if you change or mind or head somewhere where you really need more gears, you can swap the rear wheel and call it good.

I'd also just use the derailleur as a tensioner until you are sold on the SS bike packing life. 

Since you've got a 12 speed cassette and chain on there now, you'll probably want to get a 6/7/8 speed chain. 

You could also just throw a single speed cassette on your current wheel and give it a go for a few trips. You can find them on Amazon for under $30.",1606780901

I agree there should be a slim safety net, and whether or not you do or what level that should be set at is an argument in its own right which comes down to moral systems and values which always differ.

Now, taking that as true - there will be some sort of safety net - what is fact and not opinion about the matter is that the best way the government could provide that safety net is via payments.  Direct transfers of money versus trying to provide services (think education, roads, healthcare) itself versus giving someone money to spend on private enterprises providing those things.  We know the government fails miserably at providing services, and in fact is so incompetent that we would be best off leaving the job to simply being writing checks - a job which we know they can do.  

My argument is that as long as we have a safety net, we'd be way better off having that come in the form of direct payments versus all the shit we try and fail to make the government do well today.  It is more economically efficient, and it actually incentivized the right behavior and lets people budget and make decisions on their own so they can actually learn - rather than depending on government services and voucers all their lives.",1606780903

"PowerShell","t5_2qo1o","I have created a few little scripts..

We monitor for bad block event logs to detect failing drives, but they are prone to false positives from crappy USB drives. To combat this, I made a script that matches up the volume information in the event logs to the drive letters and physical disk model so we can easily see if the drive was an attached USB drive or one of the internal drives we need to investigate.  


Sample Output:

    EventLogMessage       DriveLetter DiskModel
    ---------------       ----------- ---------
    \Device\Harddisk0\DR0             Samsung SSD 860 EVO 1TB
    \Device\Harddisk0\DR1 C:          Samsung SSD 860 EVO 1TB
    \Device\Harddisk0\DR2             Samsung SSD 860 EVO 1TB

The second one I made pulls the DNS settings from the registry for the default network adapter and reports back if the machine is using DHCP, Static IP assignments, or DHCP with manual DNS assigned. This last one is generally what causes problems when we need to re-IP a client or install a new server with the DNS server information changing. It identifies the systems which will cause problems.

The last one that I creates a Wifi Profile via our RMM and can deploy wifi connection profiles to the device automatically. In order to make a wifi profile the default, you have to know the interface name.  Additionally, I've only found the data needed to set this by using the netsh utility. Since there is no native powershell interface for this information, I resorted to using ConvertFrom-String using the -TemplateContent switch to pull the data into a powershell object. It took 9 different samples for the machine matching algorithm to be 100% successful though. It would have been faster to use match and select-string, but it was a really neat learning experience to use the -TemplateContent switch with ConvertFrom-String.

"nbn","t5_2s47u","I‚Äôm going to offer up a different path. It‚Äôs a bit of a ‚Äúkludge‚Äù but should work, with a caveat... it will only give you 100mbit/s port speed, not 1Gbps. The upside, is it doesn‚Äôt mean running new cabling, and may be a cheaper option.   


Buy a pair of these port splitters. 

[https://www.4cabling.com.au/cat-5e-cable-splitter-data-data.html](https://www.4cabling.com.au/cat-5e-cable-splitter-data-data.html)

1. Install one in the garage, feeding the existing blue cable from the NTD into the ‚Äúblue‚Äú socket side of the splitter, and plug the splitter plug into the garage faceplate where the existing blue cable was. 
2. Plug a short cable between the ‚Äúred‚Äù side of the splitter and the currently empty wall socket in the garage. 
3. At your router end, unplug it‚Äòs WAN cable from the wall socket, and install the second splitter into the wall.
4. Plug the router WAN cable to the splitter ‚Äúblue‚Äù socket. Make sure your internet comes back online. 
5. Add a new cable from one of your empty router ‚ÄúLAN‚Äù sockets to the ‚Äúred‚Äù side of the splitter. 
6. Finally, add a patch cable in your study from the wall socket to the PC, and make sure you have an internet connection there. 

You can buy the additional Ethernet cables at 4cabling as well.   
Here is a short red one for the garage end:

[https://www.4cabling.com.au/0-5m-cat-5e-ethernet-network-cable-red.html](https://www.4cabling.com.au/0-5m-cat-5e-ethernet-network-cable-red.html)

And a longer red one for step 5 above:

"Tekken","t5_2s7yn","Ok, im not a ""TMM Hater"", i just disagree with alot of things he says and i find him very biased. I think this is the biggest reason alot of people dont like him. Just to take a recent example is when he showed season 4 changes. He showed drags new move and said ""Its a homing mid safe move. It goes against dragunovs identity (because he is supposed to be weak to Sidestepping). Its plus 12 oB and sets up his pressure. COME ON! \*rolls eyes\*"". Literally 2 minutes later: ""Kazuyas new ws1+2 move is a safe homing (almost) move that is +14 oB. But it DOES NOT go against Kazuyas identity, It just sets up the vortex"".... Like come on dude... This was just one example of a recent event. There are plenty of others.... Even this tweet he replied to knee with, he implied that 6 million people outside of the pros, like the 2d characters and want them in the game... This is just plain wrong.

The thing about TMM is that alot of new people listen to him. I sincerely believe his content is misleading to newer - intermediate players, and that it encourages a ""bad mentality"" about the game. People who are actually relatively good at this game, see through alot of the ""non sense"" he speaks, but some of them might still like him because of his personality. But i hope you still got a answer for why some people dislike him.

Lastly I'd like to say that i think the community is being a bit to harsh on TMM atm. Sure i think he did wrong doings today and im generally on Knees side of the opinion, but people have literally turned it into cyber bullying at this point.",1606780908

Because there was evidence of Russian interference and no evidence of Trump's claims. Basically Clinton had a point and Trump made stuff up.

&gt;Trump supporters seemed very confident of victory and haven't accepted the result.

[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/election-trust-polling-study-republicans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/10/election-trust-polling-study-republicans)

&gt;Seriously? Like every other talking point in the right-wing media is examing why the left hates some aspect of the right.

I've seen those talking points but I've rarely seen them give the actual liberal argument. Instead they give a distorted view.

&gt;Dems lost seats in the house and are on track to lose the Senate. Not a resounding victory.

It definitely isn't but it's still a victory. Why are democrats supposed to reach out for ambiguous victories but republicans aren't when they lose?

&gt;Ya you're failing to understand me. The left says a lot of things about the right and the right interrogates why they say that. The right says a lot of things about the left and the left dismisses those criticism and calls the right racist and ignorant.

When does the right seriously interrogate why they say that?

&gt;Because the right already reaches out all the time. Nobody from the right complains about giving anyone on the left a platform. The left is the only side that punishes people for reaching out to the other side.

Because the right has control over few platforms. The ones they do are generally closed off to people seen as unnecessarily conservative (e.g. Romney barred from CPAC).

&gt;I'm saying the right reaches out vastly more than the left.

The last democratic nominee insists he can work with republicans while Trump has accused democrats of trying to ""abolish the suburbs"".

&gt;I didn't say that. I said you don't get to talk about the evils of divisiveness then turn around and be divisive.

So you are criticising calling out divisive behaviour?

&gt;Because Republicans are perfectly willing to reach out and the left isn't.

I see no evidence of that and plenty of evidence of the opposite.

&gt;Fair enough. Just don't complain about divisiveness.

I'm not. Frankly, democrats should not attempt to compromise with republicans as I don't believe that's possible. I'm fairly glad they're becoming increasingly partisan.",1606780910

"Asexual","t5_2rhee","I don't think that sex is important to maintain a healthy relationship. It may be that way for those who rely on that to bond with their mate, but I think you can bond without such a thing.

Cooking together, learning things about each other's hobbies and being active participants in those hobbies are also bonding experiences.

I don't think sex is as important as an actual spiritual connection to your partner. And that can be obtained through talking about your emotions and fears, about what makes you happy, about what life means to you and your partner(s).

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","Back before the civil ware there were states being added to the country. When Kansas came into the picture, there was an even number of slave states, and free states. There was debate whether or not Kansas was going to be a free state or a slave state. When they decided that it will be a free state, states below the mason Dixon line (invisible line separating slaves states from free states) decided they wanted to secede because they felt like their states right were being violated.

Of course this is only a summary off the top of my head. It is not at all in depth but this is basically how it went, skipping all the minor details.",1606780911
"MurderedByAOC","t5_xkt2h","I would have preferred Yang. Or Bernie. Or Tulsi or Ryan or maybe even Warren. Hell, just about *any* of the Dems who ran (except perhaps *Bloomburg*) would have been a better candidate than Biden, and I probably would have voted for them.

I mean it really would have been that simple. Just offer me *one* believable progressive policy promise, and you would have gotten my vote. As much as I supposedly love ""purity tests"", I actually do prefer getting things done and making real change, and the *only* reason why I even considered voting for Hawkins is because Biden has a long and storied voting record of fighting *against* the things I stand for, time and time and time again.

&amp;nbsp;

Donald Trump did not appear *ex nihilo* from a vacuum, he is a fungus that grows out from the rotting log that is America under decades of corrupt neoliberalism, and Joe Biden might as well be the personification of this rot. Median income has been stagnant since the 70s, student debt gets bigger and bigger by the day, healthcare costs and military spending continue to spiral out of control, the racist war on drugs continues to ruin lives, and there is an entire generation of young Americans who have literally never known peace, only endless fucking war.

But I get you, I found it creepy too until I understood a little better how the tech works. I'd say a more valid test is having ALL apps closed, microphone privileges not granted to apps from Facebook, and the two phones not being on the same wifi, plus having GPS turned off. Also, no contact info for the other party on the phone, including texts or prior communication. Basically, two perfect strangers, with the above phone setups having a conversation about an odd subject, that neither has had an interest in before.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","This is because of how veins work vs arteries. Arteries which carry oxygenated blood from the heart throughout your body are at the ""start"" of the system and have the most pressure from the heart behind them, they also have ""pumps"" built into the structure to help move the blood along through the system and into capillaries, they do not have ""one way valves"" because the pressure is enough to always keep the blood moving forwards.

Veins on the other hand are at the ""end"" of the system are return the blood to the heart and lungs to be oxygenated again. They have the least pressure from the heart and do not have any ""pumping"" mechanism other than blood pressure from the heart, they also contain the biological equivalent to a ""one way valve"" so the blood can only move in one direction. Because of the one way valve any pressure places on them causes the blood to be forced back towards the heart. This can be from compression clothing, such as diabetic socks, but also things like massage or even exercise and the flexing of muscles will put pressure onto the veins and because of the ""one way valves"" it will always direct that blood back to the heart, improving circulation.

So compression does not help ""blood flow"" per se, but up to a certain point it does assist with forcing blood through the veins and back to the heart, although too much compression can cut off circulation entirely.",1606780912

Position previously held by Sarah Huckabee Sanders.

&gt;Devin O‚ÄôMalley

Position previously held by Katie Miller before she was promoted.

&gt;Judd Deere

Preceded by Lindsay Walters.

&gt;Dan Scavino

Literally first person to ever hold this position. Preceded by Stephanie Grisham in role of Communications director, however.

Also, this is the role that I pointed out Biden‚Äôs team didn‚Äôt call ‚ÄúSenior‚Äù, while Trump‚Äôs team did.

"newfoundland","t5_2qzqt","This is right, but might be only to a certain extent. European countries taught us that this stays true untill you reach a critical amount of infected in the schools, then they immediately become the number one spreader. Italy saw a rise of 1000% on the daily cases (yes, 1000, not 100) within two weeks of the school openings and a reduction of half the cases two weeks after they closed. Other measures remained pretty much the same. It's pretty clear that the schools were the cause. Newfoundland is not comparable in size, density and overall population to any european country, but it is just as likely that the schools turn in the number one spreader. Again, as long as the cases remain low, schools are just fine. As soon as the cases rise, schools are the place where students coming from the most disparate places aggregate. They meet after school as well. Also, they are often asymptomatic and they easily spread the disease in their families. Basically one sick student can condemn 20 families at once (or more or less, I don't know how big classes are here). There comes a point where it is absolutely crucial to close schools. As you said though, it's obviously better to close George street bars and pubs first ;) Last note, this is mostly valid for middle/high schools. Very young kids appear to be actually be fairly bad spreaders and parents of young kids are definitely more responsible.",1606780915

"blackopscoldwar","t5_2abod4","It drives me crazy to see people post ""Work on patches faster"".  Game developers are some of the most underpaid and over-worked people in the software dev community.  Let them work their process and get the right changes in as soon as they can.  If they go too fast they will just end up breaking more stuff.  It sometimes takes time to find, fix, and deploy proper bug fixes. I think they have done a pretty good job so far trying to make daily updates, though some of them have caused more issues to my previous point.  

Yes it is frustrating to us the gamers to have a game constantly crash among other items, but from experience, I know there are people on the other side of that keyboard that are really trying to fix this stuff.  Not only are they working on it, those people have families and other life requirements they need to focus on.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","forgot to add details; was just asking out of curiousity. I'm 23. One of my younger brothers plays basketball on a gym team. He's 15, and was invited to a casual hangout where a teammate's brother was the only one home (the brother was 18; the oldest person there) and seemed fine allowing drinks to some of the younger (minor) people who were there, including some teammates. Parents had no clue about the party happening in their house. My brother felt uncomfortable and walked home about 5 minutes after coming to the party, but texted someone else who eventually told another parent, and soon enough it got back to another parent who called the police and the 18 year's parents as well

No minors needed medical treatment from what I know, although I'm not sure how many minors had drunk. The party was in NY, LI. Younger brother is just nervous that someone will try to get him back for leaving immediately and being a snitch",1606780915

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Rock n Roll, Punk and Metal sincerely need their own awards show, maybe televised on an alt. network like Spike or something. I know there's the golden gods awards for example that have sometimes been televised. 

Awards for music or arts are stupid. However, every year there's always tons of vitriol and spite from people wondering why rock, punk metal or other lesser genres don't get the recognition they think it deserves and I somewhat agree. There's nothing about this year's best album nominations for example that scream to me that they're better than say Kvelertak's Splid or say the newest Lamb of God, what it all really comes down to is personal taste or bribes I guess because you can't sit here and tell me these albums are ""better"" production-wise than some of the metal albums I've heard this year, or even something like The Lasers by Gareth Emery. 

The Grammys have ALWAYS been a gratuitous joke and a hand-job the pop industry gives itself. No amount of bitching and whining will ever change this. There just needs to be other awards shows made to please everyone else. 

Awards shows are stupid. But you just wanna put on a big spectacle for other genres of music to validate or appease it's fans, then I am for that idea.",1606780915

If one of their classmates revealed themselves as a traitor, it would devastate them, and possibly make it hard for them to trust one another.

I personally really liked Wonder Woman, her character development as well as her chemistry with the pilot guy. However, the side characters were excruciatingly bad (the sniper was one dimensional, the Native American is not explored AT ALL apparently he‚Äôs a god but I don‚Äôt remember that being said in the movie, and the French Algerian is simply a shit character), and the ‚Äúmain‚Äù villain is so evil it‚Äôs laughable. Ludendorff just casually kills like half the German army and is almost childish with his antics. You cannot take him seriously at all. Of course the actual villain just does not fit the bill for being intimidating. I love the actor but he is not God of War material. I did like Dr Poison but she was not developed properly and was more of an extension of Lundendorff. As for the plot it was alright.

People like to bicker over whether a card with the same cost, tribe, and health with +1 attack is *strictly better* than another with 1 less attack because ""Oh, now it's a target for Shadow Word: Death or whatever!"" So it's one that people get very nitpicky about, whether it applies to the card alone or to the game as a whole.  But beast tribe synergy definitely exists and could be a factor.

"anime","t5_2qh22","Rewacher here. Dub.

**About the dub**I really like the Dub of this show. Haruhi Suzumiya is voiced by Wendee Lee, who did a good number of anime over the last 20+ years, including Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop, 5 different people in Bleach, 2 characters in Jojo, and many more. When she puts on a southern accent, it is to die for.


**My take on Haruhi**
As I've gotten older, I've started to think maybe the smart, eccentric girls are more my type, like Haruhi (okay maybe not that level). It's certainly not hard to get her to carry her end of a conversation if you can get her to talk, and she's open about what her interests are.

Haruhi is smart and able to do anything if she finds the interest to do it. She heavily encourages (maybe forces against their will is a better phrase to use) to join in on her plan if they express interest, or if she picks them.

**Kyon**
Kyon broke the ice with Haruhi, and got her to open up to him more than anyone. He caught on to her mannerisms and chatted her up about it. This show was almost one episode, but Kyon managed to survive his head being slammed into the corner of the desk.

Kyon was really trying to get Nagato to say no to sharing the room. Nagato may be in the literary club, but she could NOT read between the lines that Kyon was putting down.

"totalwar","t5_2rq9c","So at this point I have about 2k hours in between WH1 and WH2 (most of it 2), with the Dwarfs in their various flavors being my favorite faction to play.  Probably around 1/3 of my game time has been playing as them.

So the rating for the dwarfs was indeed correct in that it was an easy game in WH1.  Plenty of other people have mentioned this as well.  However, as the map has expanded, and more threats showed up in the area, it has gotten a bit harder.  Then the Greenskin re-work massively buffed them, as well as bunch of other small changes here and there, which has changed the dwarfs to be much harder.

As for me, I would say it isn't too hard of a victory to pull off from there.  Moving north to take out the red eye's and azhag gives you another gold mine and secures your north.  Then you  can move south and clear out the greenskins.  It may take a bit, but honestly it isn't too hard.

For the black orcs, they are slow, and the only thing that helps them is their armor.  Which means nothing to your thunderers.  Most likely, you are experiencing issues because you aren't spamming them enough.

For reference, this is my army, and my army progression when playing as the dwarfs.

Lord  
8 Warriors -&gt; longbeards -&gt; ironbreakers  
8 Quarrellers -&gt; thunderers  
1 Grudge Thrower -&gt; cannon  
2 ""floating"" (hero's, more artillery, etc.)

Starting the game, warriors and quarrellers are good until your opponents are really spamming black orcs.  Everything less than that and you are still fine with the quarrellers.  Once you start seeing heavily armored targets, upgrade the quarrellers to thunderers.  And whenever you can make them, replace the grudge throwers with cannons, as 9/10 cannons are just straight up better.  Don't worry about upgrading the warriors until your economy can support it.

By keeping your armies fairly cheap, even with the very hard supply lines modifier, you can afford to field 2-3, and each of your armies should be able to handle 2 incoming stacks at once.  Also, go up the blue line for replenishment, followed by the red line for quarreller/thunderer damage, and focus your tech on increasing the damage for quarrellers/thunderers.  The key to victory is holding off the opponent until you can get some gold mines running, and then holding them off from one direction while you secure your borders in another.

Also, the greenskins are very good at expanding fast, but will frequently start to stumble if they can't keep expanding.  So holding them off and slowing them down is helping you, even if it feels like you are just defending against endless waves of attackers.  And get used to playing battles manually, and the art of the killbox, so you can always keep your guns shooting.  Break their army piece by piece, by concentrating your firepower and then rolling them over once you have local superiority.  Your infantry are good at holding the line for a while, so you can rely on them to just sit there and take it for a while while you wrap things up on another part of the field.

Lastly, if you can get them, organ guns are great.",1606780918

Okay hold on a second guys. Look, before we get too deep into it I just want to take a sec to send a huge thank you to the beautiful people over at RAID SHADOW LEGENDS for sponsoring this video. Now you guys know I don‚Äôt usually take on sponsors, but I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about this game recently, so I decided to throw some hours at it and give it a try, and I gotta say I‚Äôm really liking it so far. For those who don‚Äôt know RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is a free-to-play turn-based RPG that‚Äôs got like 15-million downloads over the last few months. Google Play even nominated it for an award for being one of its top RPG‚Äôs. It‚Äôs got a really cool story campaign, active PVP arenas, dungeons, 16 different factions, and hundreds and hundreds of heroes to collect and customize, and they add over a dozen new ones every single month. You can also unlock free champions, equipment, and other cool stuff just for learning how to play, which includes Arbiter (one of the best heroes in the game). As far as graphics go this game speaks for itself. It‚Äôs honestly kinda crazy how much detail these guys squeezed into a free game and for your phone, especially when you consider what used to pass for epic mobile gaming not so long ago. Anyway guys RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is constantly expanding and adding new features, so it‚Äôs really never a bad time to give it a try. And when you do make sure you go to the video description and use the special link there to get a free epic champion and 50,000 silver as part of their new player program.",1606780919

Ahh yes, i am all too familiar with the ""normal"" conversation. My bf says that a lot too. Which is understandable, wanting to go back to not having these issues is expected but I don't think they realise that they don't have to be a different person, all they have to do is listen and acknowledge your feelings as important as their own. 

All i can say is if the relationship is worth it and your connection is amazing other than this, is to keep trying. I know its not an overnight fix, but it ended up working for me. I just kept explaining that there were no expectations other than to be listened to and eventually he realised thats all it took to make me happy. I run my own business and if i have a meltdown, i know i can count on him to support me but the first 5 years any stress i dealt with alone. It can be lonely and thankless sometimes but it may work the same for you.

No idea exactly how much it does but Zhongli's E can hit you multiple times if you're in the area of multiple constructs, every second, for around 28 seconds.

Zhongli is also (probably) stronger than Xiangling when it comes to physical DPS since he can definitely use Crescent Pike reliably, and due to his combo taking less time to complete at 1.85 seconds VS Xianling's 2.15; with him also being able to make use of retracing bolide with his shield to avoid ever being interrupted mid-combo.  


Eagerly awaiting hard numbers to prove things one way or the other but his E looks really nice, and if he's even slightly stronger than Xiangling he can still do pretty respectable as a main DPS",1606780920

As you do it, try to understand how each part of the software/hardware works together. 

Then if you still have time, you can try modifying the software, or adding on hardware like a display or lights.

This is the honest answer i get when i ask Serbs ""what if i go there or there in Serbia with cro car plates"".

I live here, and i dont know is it my not giving a fuck attitude towards news like you said or what, but now you started spewing numbers of the incidents, beatings, etc..

How much do you even trust your media?
I know more than a couple of Serbs that come to Croatia for seasonal work, and not a single fucking problem, except you guys getting underpayed comparing with croatians who work seasons.

As in everything, hot zones with bitter and ignorant people are real, and yes, Slavonia is one of those zones together with Dalmatia. Cant say in what percentage they are hardcore, fakes or doing it for the crowd ""Usta≈°e"".
To be honest, those regions did get proper proper fucked by Serbian Millitary and i guess only time heals wounds, but not while putting salt on it from time to time.

But its funny, if you come to Istria or our northern coast there will be zero fucks given if you are a Serb or whatever ethnicity you or somebody else is. 
That stands if your a normal person, if your gonna be an ass and provoke the surrounding around you, chances are karma will bite you in the ass cheek.

And those parts of Croatia(Istria, Kvarner) is sometimes given a SERB LOVER STICKER from people from Slavonia, Dalmatia or jokingly Istria or Kvarner :D

Yeah, for sure you should not be needing to fear for your life when your on vacation or transiting in any country, and like i said, i wish, i HOPE that in the near or kinda near future that past can be water under the bridge.

Kodak had the best opportunity to go digital before anyone else because it in fact created the technology itself.  But refused to alter its business model and stuck with traditional photography.

Kings of industry can end up jesters or go entirely bankrupt from lack of creativity, complacency, confidence, and laziness, even when the answers are right in front of them, bolded, italiced, underlined, and screaming endlessly at them worse than a spoiled 5 year old.

Blockbuster could've ended up much better off than itself at its height if it had bought Netflix early on when it had had the opportunity(netflex presented an offer to Blockbuster DIRECTLY), but instead, scoffed at it and continued marching forwards regardless of how dire the surrounding weather became.  They were really confident and for no reason.  And these confident Kings end up peasants or dead all too frequently in the corporate world.

Xplornet still has a real chance still as much as it's a predatory, disgusting company that I myself despise deeply.  Simply because a huge % of rural customers would be fine with a reasonable connection for a reduced rate if they felt they weren't being scammed, lied to, given the run around, etc etc by Xplornet.

Not everyone will want to pay 650 or w.e it is canadian + tax for a dish they have to setup their selves or pay a third party installer to and then do some personal trouble shooting on in the future.

So there will be a market, but that market will disappear in the future with costs and other things changing(starlink becoming cheaper, installers, lte from rogers/bell from government grants becoming more prevalent) if Xplornet doesn't redefine its business model.",1606780920

"MarksmanMains","t5_3b55g","It should be a high damage class like that. 2-3 shotting other squishies (not tanks of course) in the late game is fine because that‚Äòs your only defensive tool - a hard offensive if you want to say so. It‚Äòs either kill fast or get killed fast. If you now say duuude hold on that‚Äòs waay too strong, let me ask you this, do you really think long teamfights where the adc is able to constantly AA are the case in modern Lol? No. Most fights end quick because of people oneshotting each other.

And don‚Äòt come with the argument ADC is easier because you use AA instead of skillshots. IMO it is way harder to actually click on a moving target than pressing a button with your mouse at a random position within a 180 degrees area in front of you and land the fucking ‚Äúskillshot‚Äú (nautilus hitbox eq but honestly most skillshots are easy to hit nowadays).",1606780922

I think an honest assessment of his time in office paints a positive picture of a surprisingly progressive Republican governor:

1. He was the only Republican governor in the U.S. who embraced the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and instead of suing the White House, directed his own administration to immediately implement the law
2. He was more of an environmental champion than both of his successors. He signed AB 32 into law, the most aggressive mandate for greenhouse gas reductions in the country (maybe the world).
3. He expanded access to banking services for low-income Californians who previously only relied on check cashing and high interest payday lenders.
4. He was the main backer of ballot measures to end gerrymandering (it's now handled by an independent citizens commission) and party primaries (all candidates for office now run on the same primary ballot, and the top two move to the general election, even if they're from the same party).",1606780922

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Power stone is a big buff to Thanos, but it doesn't automatically win him the fight.  Steppenwolf is definitely the weakest of the three even without taking the power stone into account.  He can do hand-to-hand combat decently but I imagine Thanos is a much better fighter.  Apocalypse has the most raw power of the three without taking the stone into account.  Thanos is mainly held back by his own reaction time or his own unwillingness to use it (remember he has the power stone when he chooses to fight Hulk for the fun of it).  Apocalypse can disintegrate stuff with a wave of his hand, and while that may not apply to the gauntlet of Thanos or his armor, it's definitely a big benefit.  He can create large structures easily and teleport fairly quickly.  He's very durable.  While I imagine the power stone would take him down eventually with a raw blast, it takes the Phoenix about a minute to completely break through his defenses, and she needed the support of Magneto, Cyclops, and Storm.  He also has raw telepathic strength.  Thanos also has the physical limitation of needing to close his fist to use the stone.  If Apocalypse is aware of this, he's probably strong enough and precise enough to overcome Thanos' grip strength with his mind, rendering it impossible to use the stone.  He then can throw a stream of debris at him, which Thanos would be powerless to stop.  Thanos is durable as well, but his skin isn't impenetrable, and since Apocalypse killed three guys with sand, I think he could easily find a way to take Thanos down.  Assuming Thanos doesn't immediately blast Apocalypse to smithereens, then Apocalypse probably has the time to figure out how to evade his attacks and beat him.  Seeing as Steppenwolf would likely appear to be the bigger threat (he's more aggressive and would likely strike first) and Thanos enjoys combat enough to try to win the fight hand-to-hand, I think Apocalypse actually pulls this off.",1606780922

The original deal was supposedly all three parties split equally, 3 ways.  Because that made sense.  /s

So by calling herself a mistress, she got 50% to walk away, leaving the other two parties to split the remainder, so the first and *actual* wife would only get 25% of assets.

And that's completely ignoring that these marriages only lasted a few years.  I don't know about marriage law in other countries, but in mine (the US), most states don't award 50/50 splits of assets when you've only been married for a few years.  Many do not even award alimony without you having been married for at least a decade.

Not only that, but some states actually penalize and would give the wife a larger settlement on the basis that if the man was able to afford *an extra freaking house* to give to his mistress, then that was money that should have been part of their original martial assets.",1606780923

A decision made by the black list site is not a decision made by the industry, which is often a point of confusion for people not familiar with the subject, whereas the black list itself is a focal point of the industry.

It's always an agency's decision to pull from the black list site, it isn't a decision made by the black list site to suddenly pass out a script placed there. That decision is left to the agency or production group to view. It's opt in.",1606780924

"CapitalismVSocialism","t5_3cct3","&gt;Where there are hierarchies, there is a state, where there is capitalism, there are hierarchies.

Hierarchy is natural. All we can do is influence whether the ones which inevitably form are justified or not, which we do by protecting freedoms and seeing where things go from there. Meritocracy is the most justified form of hierarchy I'm aware of, the result of freedom, and a free market achieves that. Government intervention violates the meritocracy.

&gt;The relative wealth is so disparate, the wealthy will always buy you out.

Only if the purchase is worthwhile. Buying $100 for $150 isn't worthwhile, for example. If a rich person expects to get $100 out of violating a poor person, they're willing to spend less than $100 obtaining that, maybe $80 for that $20 profit. A poor person knowing this is coming is willing to spend *more than* $100 in defense from this violation, because who knows whether or not that will be the last time the rich person comes around to violate them? Who knows if they won't try and take another $100 if not $200 next time? Because the poor person is willing to pay more than the rich person, even though the rich person can technically pay more, they won't, because it's unprofitable and unsustainable in the long run, and so the poor person will win out.

&gt;And charity is just another tax from another source.

You consent to charity, and there is no force initiated to make you pay. Force is initiated to make you pay taxes. You have yet to address this relevant difference.

&gt;&gt;I'm coming to these conclusions based on reason,

She puts an enormous amount of thought into her physics, politics, sociology and economics but doesn't beat you over the head with huge passages of it (usually).

The Morgaine series is a personal favourite of mine, and if you have the time and inclination to tackle it her Foreigner series is up to twenty-one(!) volumes of political sci-fi set on an alien world where humans are a sometimes-troublesome minority. The protagonist is disempowered in the first few novels which makes them not much fun for some people, but given the length of the series I think it was a smart choice that gave the character room to grow.",1606780925

The required format is as follows:

**Title (Year) - Optional Description [hh:mm:ss]**

hh = length number of hours

mm = length number of minutes

ss = length number of seconds

**All parts of the time are required, it MUST look like [xx:xx:xx]**

Examples:

* The Documentary (2020) - Trailer for this documentary [01:59:05]

* The Documentary (2020) - A documentary about documentaries [00:48:23]

* The Documentary (2020) - A documentary about documentaries [2:12:52]

If your submission is a trailer, it must be written in the description, and also flaired as a TRAILER after you have submitted it. If you do not do this, it will be removed.

They might not have transaction fee's but they sell stocks and bitcoin for higher than you can buy elsewhere. And they sell for lower than you can get elsewhere. Getting shafted on the price is even worse than paying a $10 transaction fee most of the time.

I'm not a parent but I'm a generally knowledgeable person and a gen Z old enough (20) but young enough to know the kids of helicopter parents. 

I first of all want to say most strict parents are not what Reddit refers to as strict parents. Most strict parents still want the best and they know that their kid needs to socialize and needs take risks to be successful. 

However people who helicopter parent are not strict parents there abusive. It results in damage equivalent to or greater than other forums of abuse. Most of the people I know who had helicopter parents growing up are either adults with no ambitions, opinions, backbone whatsoever and Real World experience. Or moved out with no good decision making skills whatsoever. I wouldn't be surprised if there's laws against helicopter parenting in the near future.",1606780926

You guys are freaking DELUSIONAL. Women have more options when dating. They largely dominate the sexual realm. This is bc there are more consequences for women when they have sex AND demand outweighs supply. Why do you think there are so many women prostitutes and not men? Many more consequences  for women they risk their safety and becoming pregnant. In fact women carry ALL the consequences, it's only the very recent law to benefit children that men have to pay their half of the financial burden of the baby. That's the one consequence, without it you'd have none. It's biology and being socialized not to be too sexual, not oppression against men lol. Don't ask women out if you don't want to. You aren't entitled to women's attention or a relationship with them. Women don't have to ask you out if they don't want to, that isn't oppression. A lot of women prefer men that are confident and not so insecure they view asking someone out as ""oppression."" The consequences of our different biology effects everyone, moreso women but men too. That isn't oppression. Men's sexuality is more aggressive than receptive anyway, every study on men and women's sexuality shows this and I personally know lots of men that are turned off by women asking them out. Studies show most men are. The reason why you see this sentiment on reddit is bc the demographic is full of men who don't have the social skills needed to date, and blame women for it. Women are oppressed in literally every other sphere, political, social, etc. You guys perceive women as having control over their sexuality and decide it's oppressing men. So basically women having control over their own bodies and who they have sex with is male oppression? LMFAO. Get the fuck out of here. There are women who prefer to ask men out. Date them, stop worrying about the women that prefer confident men that go for what they want. They don't have to ask you out if you don't want to. Personality preferences are not oppression, ESPECIALLY ""systemic opression"" which I am 100% sure you have no clue the meaning of. Dating norms came from the differences in consequences of sex for men and women, as women fully carry the reproductive burden. God forbid women think about their own health and safety over your perference to not have to ask someone out lol. 

You aren't entitled to sex and you aren't oppressed all bc women aren't lining up to fuck you while you do absolutely nothing lol. Delusional!",1606780927

Most likely you will get someone who is going to buy a template for something like WordPress and get it all setup for you.  

This also brings up what your plan is for ongoing support.

"history","t5_2qh53","Because medieval wars were very rarely about battles. Mostly armies tried to avoid them, because they came with a huge risk. (The risk to lose. Or to win, but with most of your social elite dead.) The normal approach was to harm the enemy side as much as possible, usually by destroying the food supply (devastating fields, burning villages, and so on) with the intend to force them to agree on peace under your conditions. Field battles were more an act of desperation if that didn't work. There was also no differentiation between military personnel and civilians. People who would show up to view a battle would be as much of a target as anyone else who wasn't known to be an ally. (Remember: No uniforms. If you don't recognize the banner of an ally, that's probably an enemy.) Also being near a siege was generally bad, because the attacking army would be constantly short on food and loot the area. Not a good place for a picnic.    

In the 18th century wars were much more organized. The goal was winning a decisive battle by concentrating all forces on a small area. Armies were fed by supply trains, which was financed by modern taxation. Sure, armies did confiscate food if necessary, but specifically targeting the civilian population had no purpose and would've make no sense in that context.",1606780928

More seriously, the decision payoff is clear here.  If the Democrats take the Senate in Georgia, they will need every vote on board, and thus have to adjust to the most conservative Democrat, looking to be Manchin this time.  Going further left would be a poison pill.

If the Democrats don't take the Senate in Georgia, they have to adjust to the most liberal of the Republicans.   So, ugh, Collins?  And maybe that works.  But in a world where they all hide behind McConnell and do nothing, which is possible, that happens no matter *who* you nominate, so it's a wash.

Probably the most you would get out of a home IPS is detecting Tor and p2p, or protecting a home web server (preferably with a WAF like CloudFlare Pro, $20 a month).

"toarumajutsunoindex","t5_2t51t","1. Pretty much yeah. Magic was originally created as a way for people who werent born with powers (gemstones) to gain powers
2. Possibly, but im 90% sure theres an age limit. Hasnt been outright confirmed in series, to my knowledge at least, but my guess is that power development doesnt work on people past adolescence. Weve yet to see any adult espers, after all, and theres got to be a reason that AC chose to use children
3. Difference in how they got their powers. Gemstones are more natural magic, psychic abilities are scientifically created magic, to massively oversimply it
4. Maybe? Tree diagram was apparently able to create a parameter list that told the researchers which kids would be capable of reaching what levels, mightve also been able to predict what powers they would have but im not sure
5. Born with them
6. Wont work. Power development gives people something that they dont already have. Either nothing would happen or the passively activated deep blood ability would have the same compatibility as magic and kill Himegami",1606780929

I have the bracelet and a matching NATO, but here it is today on a leather strap which I think also goes well with it.

I love how the watch takes on a different feel depending on the setting, especially the blue half of the bezel which can run the spectrum from black to a pretty navy blue in different lighting. I didn't spend much time composing the photos and getting the lighting quite right - I had the rest of my walk to get to and was just snapping one-handed with my phone! - but just thought I'd share!

Pretty much you want to be inside the circle and in a power position waiting for the people that are being forced in into it, that way you will clean up the area and get some kills. Repeat this process until you start getting to the end. Towards the end try to find the high ground and camp there. Also make sure your loadouts are good",1606780929

Overall, I will disagree on your point that the game is low effort.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I would say roughly one month worth of grinding for a high-end single player ship (say, a F8 Lightning) from a starter ship like Aurora with the player committing a reasonable amount of playtime per day, going the normal gameplay route (ie, lawful activities and not smuggling drugs) and doing good money management (ie, gradually trading up ship and not just be stuck with Aurora all the time) is acceptable.

And for cap ship like the Polaris (which is not really meant for single player) any where between 6 months to 1 year from starter - which would effectively prevent most solo players from doing it.

But after a year of playing, I would expect that the player with just a starter would either have a dozen or so high end solo ships or medium size multi-role, or one small cap ship (expect more former than latter). This would put them on par with people who sunk several hundred dollars in the game.",1606780930

"energy_work","t5_2t3ww","A lot of people are telling you to trust your gut. What your gut really is, is an accumulation of past evidence through life experiences. If you grew up in foster care, chances are that your gut was honed on negative experiences and for the purpose of protecting yourself. It‚Äôs quite possible that you no longer need that type of protection. You aren‚Äôt a vulnerable child anymore. But your gut doesn‚Äôt know that. Your gut is still saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get close. They‚Äôll be gone soon.‚Äù ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt believe what they say. They don‚Äôt love you; they just want the money.‚Äù 

Additionally, if you didn‚Äôt receive the love and affection you needed (and deserved) as a child, romantic relationships will prove to be a completely different hurdle and you absolutely can‚Äôt trust your gut for that. Read up on attachment disorders to understand that. 

If you also believe in the power of intent and of manifestation, then your overprotective gut will cause you to manifest these scenarios throughout your adult life as well. You need to retrain your gut. Base your life decisions on evidence only. Not on love. Not on someone else‚Äôs promises. On their actions. And on the results of those actions. Teach your gut to stop being so much on the defensive. 

I also highly recommend a platonic, same sex friend with whom you can talk about partners as a way to normalize dating. Make sure that friend comes from a loving home and has healthy relationships and healthy boundaries.",1606780930

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Personally had thought the PM had made a mistake responding to the Chinese Foreign Ministries chief attack dog propagandist, but seems there is a bigger picture story behind it.

One of my favourite booked marked Podcasts on ABCs Listen App is a Segment called "" The Signal "". The Signals is a great place to hear quality non biased journalism to gain an understanding that is behind a current story.

This mornings topic was called "" Why Australia lost it with China "", it is important to gain an understanding as to why a Government Official with obvious Xi endorsement Tweeted out an attack against Australia on a Human rights issue when China has no more concern about Human rights  than a fly hitting a windscreen.

It seems Chinas beef with Australia is not actually about Australias demand of an Investigation behind  COVID-19, it is about our recognising the growing influence of China and its taking over of Australian assets, eg Electricity grids Poles and wires, significant political donations to both major parties to gain quid pro quo influence etc.

On the surface the PM, should have ignored the Tweet, a tweet that was crafted as a lie to be deliberately offensive.

If you listen to ABCs "" The Signal "" podcast, with interviews with Bill Birtles, ABCs long term China Correspondent you will understand that the Tweet was a CCP directed test of Australias Independence or whether we will let China break us into submission using trade as a club.

I urge people fed up with opinion pieces and random talking heads give it a listen and make up your own mind.

People absolutely do, but they don't have the right to pass off those opinions as ""facts"", ""evidence"", or ""truth"". Therein lies the problem. Rush Limbaugh, for example, is not an expert or educated source on anything he pontificates about (I'll allow that he's more knowledgeable than most on, say, which microphones work the best or when it is a good time of year to fly to Thailand), yet his audience devours up his rants as truth. ""Fox News"" has literally argued in court, more than once, that it is an entertainment medium, not an actual news source, yet millions still tune in every day and call what it broadcasts factual. They only change stream when they might literally get their asses sued off for doing so (One idea why they're no longer parroting Trump's vitriolic rants is not just because they know a sinking ship when they see one, but they're very, very concerned that by endorsing him downplaying Covid, they've opened themselves up to litigation).",1606780930

It's okay to be awkward sometimes.

Don't go in with a script. Just talk. If you mess up, you can laugh at yourself. They'll probably laugh too. You know how I feel when I see someone mess up, then laugh at themselves? I like them! I find them charming! It humanizes them, because despite what you may believe, we ALL feel awkward sometimes. It's just that we anxious fuckers feel it more often.

So screw it. Fumble your words, then joke about what a marble mouth you are. Ask your dumb question, and chuckle at how dumb you are, and how obvious the answer was. Sure, you'll get the odd person who will whisper to their coworker and laugh at you once you leave. Who gives a damn? You'll also get the odd person who whispers to their coworker how funny you were. Or how chill you were. Or how, despite your enormous, imposing eyebrows, you were actually pretty nice (okay that might be more specific to me).

And the most amazing part of this is, when you stop caring about being awkward, you get less awkward anyway. The moment you accept it, it becomes way less of a problem, because a lot of what makes a person awkward (at least, in my case) is the constant worry about being awkward, which results in overthinking.

So go out, fuck up, laugh at it, and move on!

No, you personally won't ""notice"" the difference, but if you scale that difference up to *millions* of people then even that small difference will add up to quite a large impact. Or as the common saying goes: ""Kleinvieh macht auch Mist"".

In that context, it's rather shortsighted to handwave efficiency away as being inconsequential, when this whole problem isn't just one of energy generation, but also about energy consumption: If we consume our energy more efficiently, then we also need to generate less of it.


&gt; Why didn't they invest more money in research of nuclear technologies, but have lead war against it for decades? 

Did you even read my previous comment? Germany is a world leader in fusion research. Building the largest and most advanced stellarator is not cheap nor easy stuff.

&gt; Maybe we could have had thorium based nuclear reactor already

Sure, just like Thorium fueled cars, right? The thing is: Right now *nobody* has thorium-based reactors running, and past attempts at them have turned into rather [expensive and toxic messes](https://thebulletin.org/2014/05/thorium-the-wonder-fuel-that-wasnt/). 

&gt; In combination with renewable energy, and phasing out harmful fuels, you would create more good things than bad.

Which is exactly what we are doing, hydrogen is the fuel of the future, not doubling down on an uneconomical stop-gap technology that leaves our following generations with just another long-term problem to deal with, putting them in a very similar situation that we are currently stuck with.

That's why it's important to create *sustainable* and innovative solutions instead of trying to do more of the same thing over and over again.

&gt; For example:

It's weird how you evoke a machine learning-based study from a private US NGO, while completely ignoring the public German study on child leukemia rates near German reactors I just linked to.

Playing through the games normally results in Pokemon getting a mish-mash of EVs until they hit the limit. To specifically direct a Pokemon's EVs, you can make them repeatedly fight specific species or use the Vitamin items to give up to 100 EVs in a specific stat.

"SeaMonkeys","t5_2wyug","Thank you the bucket thing will probably be helpful in the future as the humidity in my house is very low.

First the salinity: when the water level was normal  I had readings of 36ppt or 1.027 S.G my little gadget shows me both readings. When the water level was low however the salinity rocketed past my highest reading which is 40 ppt /1.028 SG. I tried to keep adding spring water to top of the tank and this would stabilise the salinity for a few days then it would go high again as the water evaporated

The tank is 10litrs or 2.1 gallons but I never had it all the way to the top so I'd say closer to 1.9 gallons. 

I was feeding them aqua dragon food. 1 spoon a week. 

I tried to slow down bubbling but when I do I find that I will return to the tank later to find not Air is getting to the stone at all. I think the bleed valve somehow manages to loosen more over time and so the air goes out through that instead. I'm thinking of tapping the switch intl place so it can't do this. I only leave it on in the day and then swith it off at night for maybe 10 hours. 

There is a 50w heater in the tank that I have set to 20C but I think maybe I should have had this a little warmer. The two thermometers I have seemed to find this temprature was consistent. 

The water was and still is quite hazy. I checked the pH yesterday and it was 7. I do recall reading they prefer alkaline environment and that Epsom salts should be added with larger tanks along side the normal salt but I did not read this until after I'd had my tank running for months and it didn't seem go be an issue but maybe it was. 

Lastly there was a recent addition of a grow lamp as I was getting no algae growth but also no sunlight in this room. While no green algae grew I have notices a white filmy stuff on the top that was there a little bit before but more so now. 

I plan to get a smaller tank, between 1.3 gallons and 1.7 gallons. In the hopes of managing the tbe water level better with a smaller water surface level. 

Thank you for taking the time to help me with all this. I won't be giving up even if have to add some more eggs or something like that.",1606780933

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","I feel like you're describing emotions as being the instigator. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding. 

&gt;The variable there is what we think.

I feel like the variable is instead how we feel about it based upon a gazillion cycles of Feelings - Behavior - Thought. I get terrified to sing in front of a crowd because I've tested those waters progressively. I've sung by myself and found my voice is not great. I've been criticized when I've sung in front of others. The initiator way, way back was Feeling like singing. 

&gt;You can actually change your feelings using thought, but you can't do it the other way around.

Isn't this a support for Feelings being the starting point? It takes Thought to augment and change our Feelings and influence Behavior, but that initial process of Feeling - Behavior - Thought has to occur first. 

&gt;you ARE in charge of your brain.

As you implied, yes and no. We have evolved over eons to interpret and respond to the chemical interactions of our brain. You can work to forge new habits, expressing that control. But we start with signals that we test the veracity of. This process starts as a baby as we test boundaries and interpret our environment. Some variables are introduced even earlier, as a fetus, responding to various stimuli, such as music, nutrition, mom's voice or mom's drug use. All of this compiles into building the framework of our psychology.",1606780933

I worked at that school for the better part of a decade. They loved that we went above and beyond our roles. They praised us for doing free work to help our students.

Anyway, assuming food IS the reason, he will probably improve eventually but it takes a long time to break cat habits.

Also if he is not neutered then that‚Äôs certainly a big factor here.",1606780934

"LiverpoolFC","t5_2qn0o","Alright, on topic then - we're allowed to criticise our players, staff, coaches etc. Its part of being a fan. It doesnt diminish your support or love of the club or its components, nor does it mean you embody YNWA any less.

The fact is, Neco has warranted criticism and his inclusion in crucial games warrants us worrying (though *not* abuse ofc). Yes, young players make mistakes, and yes coming into an unsettled squad. 

But 1) hes made consistent errors - including goal-costing ones - throughout his time in the first XI inc back of last season, even with a settled team round him

2) he doesn't seem to improve. Players like Robinson and Flanagan that absolutely did not make it were showing more maturity in their play than he is now. This is highly worrying. 

3) hes not getting the basics right. It's great being a flairy, attacking FB esp in our team. But even in Trents breakout season, Klopp rotated with the defensively solid but boring Gomez-at-RB when it wasnt coming off. He was forced to play TAA in the CL vs City home leg because Gomez was injured, it just worked out and TAA pocketed Sane. Neco either doesn't want to or cant just focus on the defensive aspect of his game. Dont worry about pushing up or making cavalry runs to support the attack. Just make sure you hold the line, make your tackles, are in position when we're out of possession, win your duels and *dont* give away cheap fouls. He cant seem to grasp that wed rather have that (see: Phillips as a cover CB. Doing the basics very unglamorously = perfect) than him attempting to add to the attack and get caught out

4) obviously this isnt unfounded as Klopp hooked Neco for a 34 year old midfielder at half time vs a Brighton team missing their best wide attacking outlet and best striker


Edit: oh and one last thing. Obviously from my username, I'm not from Liverpool. You or others might call me a plastic despite my watching Liverpool since I was 5 in '99 and grew up in a Liverpool-supporting family - that's fine. But in turn, *I* dont call people plastics without any knowledge about them. You openly say English isnt your first language, and so, unless you're rural Welsh or Scottish, or one of like 5 old school cornish people, you're not even from Britain. Nothing wrong with that, but maybe don't be so quick to accuse people of being plastic with no basis",1606780934

"vaporents","t5_2upjd","I don't dabble with concentrates, but my new [Firewood 7](https://firewoodvapes.com/collections/firewood-7) arrived this week, and it's undoubtedly the best purchase I've made since getting my Tubo 3 years ago. And the Firefly 2 was my 2nd vape and the first I ever traded on r/entexchange. Felt like a clunky plastic train whistle that could've been mistaken for a kid's toy. Luckily got a StickyBrick outta that trade. I'm sure there's something I was missing that gives others reasons to love it, but for the price, there's so many devices I'd rather at hand.   
  
If you're not dead-set on battery powered, I'd definitely explore the butane world of [Sticky Bricks](https://puffitup.com/collections/sticky-brick) - for flower and concentrate these things will knock you to your knees. Plenty of fun glass and water options available.  
  
I'm more of an artisinal, non-plastic type of vaporent, but you can't go wrong with any device from S&amp;B. The Mighty is the holy grail, but IMO for the lower price and palmable portability, I'd be just as happy with a [Crafty+](https://puffitup.com/collections/crafty-mighty/products/crafty). Other than dependability and brand legacy, the biggest selling point for me with these is the use of dosing capsules (which can be also be used in a variety of non S&amp;B devices like my Tubo with the appropriate mods). Pre-packing as many bowls as you please for a full night out or simply kicked back on your couch makes it feel like you have a mini-fridge full of beers in your pocket. And it makes for a far cleaner vape space with fewer crumbs left behind when trying to repack in a stoned stupor. My wife definitely appreciates this as well.  
  
Finally, if you're patient, I'd suggest buying a Dynavap and waiting for the next Lamart [P80](https://shop.lamart.ch/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=68_91&amp;product_id=728) drop. Send them an email and ask to be on the blast list and keep a close eye on your inbox because they'll go quick as hell. And keep checking r/entexchange - every week you'll see vapes like these (P80 less frequently), all looking for new homes at a bargain. You could easily get two amazing secondhand devices for the price of something new. Hope this helps!

My college in the UC also had specific dates to change grading scale for it by, and I just opted for one class I knew I wasn't loving/just going through the motions with. The college ended up extending that to the end of the semester. I'm not sure if there is the option to change after receiving the grade, though.

Also, each of the colleges are in a different situation - I don't think every college got this extension, but many did. 

So we do have it, but I don't think it is like in Spring where I believe P/NP didn't change anything in regard to the 33%/major related stuff. I'm not totally sure, though (I transferred Fall 2020, so prior to me being there).",1606780935

No its not, people have the right to autonomy and how they use it is up to them, if someone chooses to use it and gets sick that's their own problem.

Also in the short term there is no need to curtail spending as the pandemic is raging bla bla.

Edit: Also, holy shit august 2020 put unemployment at 4.7% that is really good? And their credit rating is still very good.

They also could try to increase exports which I think can contribute to their low growth rates.

For those wondering about when J-NC will begin releasing Part 3 Volume 4 please refer to [this comment by a J-NC forum moderator](https://forums.j-novel.club/topic/3479/future-ascendance-of-a-bookworm-volume-release-schedule):

&gt; Hello!

&gt; For members new to J-Novel Club that want to know more about when future volumes will start pre-publication on the site:

&gt; After a volume releases its last part there is typically a 2-3 week break* before the following volume releases its first part. For this series in particular Ascendance of a Bookworm they are attempting to do it with no break. Please note that does not automatically mean it will be out the following week after the last part finishes.

&gt; For all those wondering why the next volume is not currently in the schedule, the schedule is updated as we get closer to the official release date, typically it will not show part 1 of a new volume until a few days before it is ready to release, and sometimes it will show on the day of release. Please rest assured when all the materials are fully prepared for part 1 to go live and the English cover has been set, part 1 will be added into the schedule as soon as we are able to.

&gt; We ask for your patience, part 1 of the following volume will start when it is ready and no sooner.

&gt; *the 2-3 week break is not a hard rule, it is just an observation based on the history of J-Novel Club pre-publication releases.",1606780936

"OnePieceTC","t5_36oy2","Honestly things are already looking rough. Global is looking better than Japan so far, but this list of legends isn't doing much.

Smoker gets the ""newest"" legend of the other 18 in Mihawk &amp; Perona, but even then I don't think that closes how wide the gap in power and how desired each unit is between Smoker and Sugar. Other than that Cracker is still a good sub and support and Komurasaki can be a decent captain if you lack better options, but overall it's a very weak part.

Sugar gets to have V2 Nami as the ""newest"" legend in the banner who is already 7 months old and while useful, doesn't see a ton of play. The fact that Carrot is still good and Sabo &amp; Koala is one of the best units in the game for hard content despite both being over a year old is doing a ton of heavy lifting for the overall value of Sugar's part of the sugo.

With only 1 legend in the past 6 months avaliable it's hard to call either of these banners good since for a lot of regular players you'll only be missing the debut legends. Although if you're missing Sabo &amp; Koala and Carrot then Sugar's part is pretty good. The other problem here is that Smoker loses the head to head against Sugar in a landslide which matters greatly when a lot of people will only be pulling for the debut legend.

Add on to it all that it's 181 gems for the first guaranteed legend and it's hard to call these banners anything but bad compared to the old system. The only silver linings are the guaranteed new batch units on multis 2, 3, 7, 10, and 19 (but did they really need to eliminiate the 5% chance at a legend on the +1?) and the debut being guaranteed at 784 gems.

The real question is what on earth our big celebration banners are going to look like under this kind of system. Going from a 12% legend rate, legend basically every multi, all guaranteed legends being Lucy or onwards, multiple steps with legends release in the past 15 months, and an all legend multi in the super type sugo to whatever the hell they can cook up under this 10 legends only system is going to be weird and probably underwhelming.

Unless they make the big celebrations only the very most recent legends released, and at that point there's really no need to ever pull on a debut sugo ever again.

It's a weird system that doesn't work for the game, the players, and honestly I'm not even sure how it's benefiting the company either.",1606780937

This is well-said man. Ridership has been noted, land managers are already starting an extremely long process of regulating the land that's being utilized. There is something really special about getting old school oral directions for a preserve with no signage.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","you know we‚Äôre talking about 2 different sets of ‚Äúpolice‚Äù right?

Like you could defund private school systems and then use the same money to refund public education schools and social services support networks. You see how that works?

We‚Äôre not talking about taking the money from the police and giving it back to the same police. It would be using that same money and putting it almost ALL back into social support systems for housing, rehabilitation centres, abuse support services, mental health support services, food banks and community hubs, and then yes.... a bit of it would be utilised to create safety task forces that use compassion and understanding and TRAINING in mental health to make sure our communities are safe. Things that reduce crime at the source - which is poverty. So yes, defund the NYPD or the Australian Federal Police or the UK police force or whatever systems that are currently in place. Defund them all. We‚Äôve had 200 years of ‚Äúreform‚Äù and evidence to show that the current systems don‚Äôt work.

"Stargate","t5_2qhar","The way I attempted to explain it to myself (and I acknowledge it's hilariously 'reaching') is that the modifications made to the DHD/gate were intended to fool the gate into thinking it was undergoing a power surge, thus jumping to another gate.  The wave wasn't a perfectly cohesive sphere, but rather a series of ever expanding pockets of energy, sort of like filling a trash bag with tennis balls or something.  Furthermore, we can't know for sure if it's a singular wave - as it is it looks like we see several waves, and that's just what we SEE; there could be millions or even billions of other waves outside the visible spectrum, and there's still some debate on whether it was visible in the first place or if that was just done for the audience's sake.  Given that the wave's identity matters more than its particular magnitude, theoretically a wave generated by a cell phone would be sufficient to disable replicators within a reasonable range to accommodate the battery of such devices.

So...the wave hits the event horizon, and travels through, propagating from that gate.  Then, instantly the wormhole jumps, and another part of this wave, one of the 'lagging' pockets or trailing waves, goes to another gate.

Another way to try and consolidate this (because several thousands jumps in one second is...extreme) is that the modification made to the DHD/gate uses the correlative system to pass this program along to other DHDs.  I program a 'jump' subroutine into the Dakara DHD, such that when the wave hits it, it forces a jump, and the wave is split between two gates, each of which gets a copy of this program - force a jump so you basically dial 2 gates, then send this program to these two new DHDs and delete itself from your current DHD.  So...wave hits the event horizon, party-way through that gate 'jumps' and has basically dialed 2 gates.  Each of those gates then activates, receives the wave and the program, immediately shuts off and dials another gate that was not already affected while the wave is travelling around the planet.  The DHD then engages this new 'program', forces a jump, so now the same wave is traveling to 2 gates, sends a copy of the program, and deletes itself from that DHD.  This will see an exponential growth of planets affected, with a turnaround of only 5-10 seconds per round of dialings, very quickly hitting every viable gate in the galaxy.  It's not instantaneous, but if they keep losing blocks that quickly it becomes harder for the replicators to get ahead of the problem.  This basically means that most gates are activating twice, but nothing we see refutes that because the only gate we see long enough is the SGC gate, which doesn't have a DHD and thus wouldn't correctly receive this program to redial elsewhere.

Obviously this is kind of ridiculous, but the writers didn't give us much to work with...",1606780940

My personal theory is that Howie has a much larger role in roster management/playing time decisions than we're allowed to know about. Howie probably makes decisions or has some influence based on the value spent on players. That's why a decrepit JP gets the start over Mailata, because they've committed more value to JP and are trying to squeeze it for all it's worth. Classic sunk-cost fallacy.

With the rumors that Doug wants out, or at least wouldn't mind getting out, it would make sense if he's feeling like his hands are tied by a pre-determined set of decisions.

Who knows. Maybe both are on the hot seat.",1606780941

"EVOOGaming","t5_29nsxq","So I have the lp6, the evoo 17 inch. I love it. It came with the same type intel drive yours has, with 1tb to start. That gave me my starting point for learning what would work best and I did a lot of research. Ended up eventually getting two ssds for it. First the intel 660p 2tb because I knew it would work with the motherboard and it's the most competitive priced midrange nvme. It's perfect for gaming as long as you aren't gonna add and delete 500gb every single day. Whether 500gb, 1tb or 2tb remember qlc is always 200tb write life per tb. So 100tb life for a500gb, or 400tb for the 2tb. That would give the 1tb model that came with my laptop a 400 day life if I were to write that much to it. That's the problem with qlcs. Although I was more than happy I wanted the empty drive filled up and endless capaciru for games so I shopped for a sata. no difference in game loading times, just write/read speed limited by the 2.5 connection. I was in no hurry so I waited, and snatched up a 2tb western digital blue ssd for 170 bucks on prime day. It's also qlc. With 5tb in my laptop though qlc endurance becomes irrelevant with a total life of a petabyte write endurance between them. With your added drives slots and your only planning on one for now then I would definitely get 660p. That way you know there is confirmed compatibility with your laptop, and the price these days is basically the same. If you just have fast internet and will be doing a lot of switching games, or will be constantly using an external drive to switch games then I recommend the samsung evo. It happens to be on sale right now for half off, but it's cyber Monday and these deals are once a year. You get what you pay for, tlc and mlc has exponentially better write life but cost a lot more. But if you don't do so much writing and erasing then speed in gaming is all the same. It's false advertising for ""gaming"" m.2 drives to say they load games faster because that's just not the case. The intel 660p can usually be found on newegg for 230 dollars for the 2tb. I would invest in more space as it will future proof your laptop against the increasing size of games and double the write endurance. Other good ones are a silicon power 2tb, a mushkin pilot, but I can't guarantee they're as good as the nvme drive that made qlc a consumer market trend and was adopted by gaming companies because of its niche it caters to in the large file, archive like nature of games. Lastly, if you go for something else just don't pay extra for pcie 4.0 nvme. Your laptop is 3.0 and cannot use the extra speed.",1606780941

Poor people buy things. They love to accumulate things. 

This pandemic also put that on display - poor people rush out and buy toilet paper. Rich people buy stocks and real estate.

I'm selling my Porsche too. Some dumb crazy woman backed into it anyway. After years of parking at the far end of the parking lot, she backed into me while going the wrong way in the fire lane.

"buildapcsales","t5_2s3dh","I have both and returned the UL600 from best buy. The only differences (assuming the rumors that they use the same panel is true):

1- on the UL600, when you remove the stand to mount it via the VESA mount there is 3in metal piece that sticks out on the back of the monitor (the piece you attach the stand on). To me it was an eye sore but that is only a personal preference. 

2- UK850 - better stand and USB-C.

3- **This is from my experience only**:  I think the 600 is a lower grade panel. It might be the same panel but I don't think it's the same grade. Here are the 850 and the 600 next to each other https://imgur.com/RrRNEY6. Although people have mentioned that I might have lost the panel lottery, When I went to best buy to return mine today I noticed that the one on display is much less yellow but it was actually still dimmer than the 850 I have even with the brightness set to 100.",1606780942

The show is actually about the real Bebbanburg, and Cornwell finding out he was directly related to Uhtred the Bold (estranged biological father). Cornwell is writing in the 1st person, so he is imagining himself, this rightful heir deprived of his Crown. The story of the Anglo-Saxon boy that was taken captive by the Danes, growing up Dane, thrown into slavery by Ragnar's son, making his way back to south Britain, is a very old one. Uhtred the Bold doesn't fit this legendary lord of Bebbanburg but his great great grandfather would have fit in this time period, Eadwulf II of Northumbria, died 913 AD.  The Norse vikings are finally able to burn it down in 993 AD, the Uhtred bloodline is scattered to south Britain. It means there is no bloodline continuity after that. Bamburgh, the castle in existence today was built by Normans over the old original foundation. Season 5 is going to start with Uhtred in some Manor, a lord with some land.

I originally just brought up jolteon as an example pokemon- I'm trying to discuss the impact of hidden power in a more abstract way rather than specifically zoning in on an example.

With that said, I suppose we can try.

The thing with specs jolteon is that being locked into hidden power ice is incredibly damaging. 

Without specs, jolteon can get away with throwing out a HP ice and having it hit something for like 5% resisted on the switch in. After all, it can still switch back to tbolt and apply enough pressure to stop a sweeper from setting up something like a shell smash.

However with specs, now jolteon must be much more careful about when it uses hidden power ice, removing it's usefulness against a pokemon like hipowndon in the first place, as the risk/reward matrix is no longer skewed in favour of jolteon, as it actually takes quite an extreme risk in just using hidden power.

It's also worth noting that once hippowndon knows jolteon is locked to tbolt, it can come in and get a free heal/free switch which is incredibly valuable",1606780944

Even if it doesnt feel like the right thing to do or even if you are grasping at reasons to prove to yourself that it may just be your fault. IT ISNT, you are in an abusive relationship with a man who does not respect your boundaries and clearly does not care about your feelings if it means sacrificing his pleasure. Run as fast as you can and beware of his words. If you try and have a civil breakup he will most likely try his hardest to deter you and berate you because that would mean the loss of someone he can control. I promise you after all is said and done and you have left, all he will regret is the temporary loss of sex and the high he gets from abusing you and will most likely swiftly move on to someone else to try and take advantage of.

It takes effort to understand what someone is going through, and you run the risk of feeling that yourself which can drain you if it is a negative emotion. It is essential for procreation, but if you already have someone or don't wish to procreate, then what is the point of giving it out indiscriminately. Earn it basically just means prove to me that the act of giving you empathy isn't going to be inequitable, which most of the time it would be. Just asking most women to try and understand my emotions when introduced to a particularly stimuli, most of them get it wrong, so I should still provide empathy to people who more often than not are incapable of providing it to me? (For example, asking them to explain the reason a man would be reticent to marry in the United States, they often will say a total lack of commitment and desire for other women, which is incorrect for most men, I'd actually like to see your answer, just as a small test). 

If I'm reading a book, I'm choosing to empathize with those characters. Also, action is always expected to go along with empathy. If all you do is understand how I feel and take no action to assist in bettering my situation, what's the point? You're just draining that finite resource and not helping in any way in the process?

The ""I don't care how you feel"" usually follows a lot of opinions that start with the phrase ""I feel..."". Especially in professional situations, what you think is far more important. Also, someone telling me they don't care how I feel wouldn't affect me much (unless it's someone I love) because I assumed they didn't already. If you assume someone cares how you feel, how is that not entitled? At best, you are entitled to apathy.

Women typically have significantly more oxytocin and other hormones in their system than men do, which is a hormone released during emotional times and increases emotional intensity and bonding (and helps facilitate contractions during childbirth) so if you produce more of that hormone than men, then that's proof that you are more emotional, with all the benefits and detriments that that provides. I have emotional needs, I just don't foist those expectations on others to help me with them. If people want to meet those needs or not, that is their choice. You're the one applying a value judgment to logic and emotion. To me they are just two separate realms of human interaction with their own advantages and disadvantages. I do better in the logical realm, but I'm not entitled to women meeting me logically, though it's nice when they choose to (same with men, but the highest a man can do with me is good friend, so I don't value it as much), why can't we approach emotions that way?

If you expect me to consider your situation, even for a second, that is time you expect me to invest in you. I will invest that time if I choose, but it's my choice. Ultimately what I want is people who I don't care about to recognize that I am just one of 8 billion on this planet, and my emotional investment isn't necessary. Men tend to accept this, women don't and get resentful. If that isn't your experience, maybe women and men treat you differently.",1606780947

She has massive paws, a blunt tail with rings, and solid stripes. Her mum was a farm cat who wasn't supposed to be getting randy with anyone, so her dad is a mystery! 
Luckily, Betty is spayed and only goes outside with us for dog walks so she can't pull the same move. 

I want to wallop them too, it makes me so sad that they're being threatened! Another problem is that wildcats are breeding with domestic cats, leading to pollution of their gene pool. I love my cat very much, but she's a living example of that problem. :(",1606780951

&gt;Most of the time it isn't necessary to specify because the context is enough ...

I don't think this is a good assumption, when this language is often used in educational resources. There may be better analogues at times, but not every situation is as painstakingly hard to avoid as a period.

&gt;... I think the phrasing is awful and they could have talked about assigned gender at birth instead.

I *really* don't see how using assigned gender would have been an improvement. It seems like it would have been even worse, moving post-op trans people from a class alongside their identified gender to being classed in with their assigned gender.

&gt;Ideally, science should stop assuming there's a sex binary and just ask people their gender to avoid such sentences. That would be much more humanizing than either ""women"" or ""vagina owner"" which are both cissexist in this context.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Clientes do Carrefour disseram √† Pol√≠cia Civil que foram importunadas dentro do supermercado por Beto Freitas, 40,[ espancado at√© a morte no local](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/morte-de-beto-freitas-e-ainda-mais-selvagem-que-caso-de-george-floyd-diz-reitor-da-zumbi-dos-palmares.shtml). Segundo os relatos das testemunhas, as importuna√ß√µes ocorreram em ocasi√µes anteriores ao dia do homic√≠dio.

 A delegada Roberta Bertoldo, que investiga o caso, afirmou que as testemunhas procuraram espontaneamente a Pol√≠cia Civil para relatar os epis√≥dios. Bertoldo afirma que novas imagens de v√≠deo das c√¢meras de seguran√ßa do Carrefour est√£o sendo analisadas para verificar a veracidade dos relatos.

 Bertoldo ressaltou que, mesmo que as importuna√ß√µes sejam confirmadas, estes fatos ‚Äún√£o alteram absolutamente nada o fato de ter havido um homic√≠dio‚Äù. Mais de 40 pessoas j√° foram interrogadas pela pol√≠cia, que aguarda o laudo do Instituto Geral de Per√≠cias (IGP) para concluir o inqu√©rito.

 ‚Äú[As testemunhas] referiram que a v√≠tima era algu√©m que, por vezes, costumava causar algumas intercorr√™ncias no mercado, importunando algumas pessoas que l√° estavam no sentido de fazer as suas compras ou adquirir algum produto‚Äù, disse ela.

 Um dos seguran√ßas presos pelo crime [disse √† pol√≠cia que n√£o houve discuss√£o com Beto Freitas ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/seguranca-diz-que-nao-houve-discussao-com-beto-freitas-antes-de-espancamento-no-carrefour.shtml)antes da agress√£o. Ele afirmou tamb√©m que n√£o teve a inten√ß√£o de mat√°-lo. Logo ap√≥s a pris√£o em flagrante, ele [havia optado por permanecer em sil√™ncio](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/segurancas-do-carrefour-recorreram-ao-direito-de-ficar-em-silencio.shtml). Por√©m, na √∫ltima sexta-feira (27), falou durante cerca de quatro horas em depoimento √† Pol√≠cia Civil.

  ‚ÄúA inten√ß√£o dele [segundo o depoimento] era t√£o somente de imobilizar a v√≠tima [Beto] em raz√£o de que, depois de ela t√™-lo atingido com um soco, teria ficado extremamente agressiva‚Äù, relatou Bertoldo.

 √Ä **Folha** [a delegada afirmou que nada justifica](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/de-perfil-tecnico-delegada-do-caso-beto-freitas-diz-nao-sentir-pressao-em-investigar-carrefour.shtml) a viol√™ncia cometida contra Freitas.

 ‚ÄúMuito se fala sobre a vida pregressa da v√≠tima, sobre ter causado algum embara√ßo anterior no supermercado. Apuramos tudo para entregar o inqu√©rito mais completo poss√≠vel √† Justi√ßa, mas nada muda o teor da viol√™ncia. A rea√ß√£o foi desproporcional‚Äù, diz.

 Al√©m dos dois seguran√ßas que agridem Beto Freitas, √© poss√≠vel ver no v√≠deo a fiscal do supermercado Adriana Alves Dutra filmando e observando o espancamento sem interferir na a√ß√£o. [Ela foi presa](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/policia-prende-fiscal-do-carrefour-por-participacao-no-assassinato-de-beto-freitas.shtml) na √∫ltima ter√ßa-feira (24).",1606780951

If it's 60k RMB then your best bet would be using an ATM card to just withdraw the money where you are. 

If it's more, then using a friend is the best option. But a Chinese friend will only be able to do $50k USD per year. And depending on the amount, and how much they make, it could also be a trouble if it looks irregular. 

For large amounts you need to show tax receipts to get around the $500/day conversion limit from RMB to USD. And then you need to deal with the paperwork to do the international wire. It's possible banks have come up with a procedure to do this from abroad in special cases due to the pandemic, but I doubt it. My guess is that it still has to be done in person. 

Last option, if you've got your UnionPay card with you, just buy stuff. UnionPay is widely accepted internationally and many Chinese tourists will just use it buy stuff overseas without pre-converting currency.",1606780952

Also since it seems very sorcerer oriented imo, maybe a snippet saying you can choose whichever effects you want whenever you spend a sorcery point to enhance this cantrip

"ProjectZomboidScam","t5_2438yf","I am thinking for myself. I have 1500 hours in both Minecraft and Project Zomboid. I have watched both games and I saw one studio go from a small group of devs to being acquired by a $150Billion corportaion, and the other go from a small group of devs into a slightly larger group of devs. Both games hit a development stagnation around the same time (2014-2017) and both have now been releasing amazing updates that keep outdoing the previous ones. Lost my faith in both games for a while, but now I'm playing both more than ever. The difference is that Minecraft had a rushed and sloppy release to get through the alpha and beta. The 1.0 version of Minecraft is a hollow shell of what was promised. There is very little replayability compared to Beta 1.0, and the Late/End game were barebones at best. 1.1-1.8 added some necessary features that managed to fix a lot of problems but the game had just become stale. They didn't nurture the baby enough to make it an amazing game to last. It took major dev team overhauls and lots of community feedback to get to the 1.13-1.17 cycle we've had the last few years. The game is finally fulfilling the original promise of a sandbox block game with a deep crafting and mining system. The building system has always been worked on, and the replayability has been improving. But we are just now finally getting a Cave update for a game with Mine in the literal title. The fact that a small team of 10\~ devs working on PZ as a passion project in their part time, have taken their time to nurse the game through alpha and only release the game when it matches their vision. It's taken years to get the tech and systems in place to finalize it, but they've done it without billions of dollars. Just the $1 million they have gotten over 10 years to keep their devs tooled up and keep the lights on with their studio fees. The game is 100x better than it was in 2013 and this is what they always envisioned. If you played back then and now you hate the game, you were probably the type on the forums asking for a way to win and escape the zombies or the ability to use a flamethrower or nuke lmao. When Build 41 comes out and completely changes the game and community and multiplayer takes over Twitch and Youtube like SP challenges and playthroughs already have, you'll be eating your words bro. And when B42 makes it even better and the hype train for Beta and Full release in a few years starts to roll, you'll probably get on again cuz we all love this game how could you not dude?",1606780955

"popheads","t5_39nwj","It happened on this sub with Trollz, Stuck with U, Rain On Me, probably others. 

It didn't happen with Cardigan because this sub has a bunch of Taylor stans who were super eager to see her get a no 1 and ignored the tactics used (hallo candlelight remix).

It didn't happen with a song like The Scotts because popheads wasn't paying attention to either Kid Cudi or Travis Scott, and didn't care so much - also the fortnite bump brought a novelty to the success of the song. 

Imo, so long as radio is still given such huge weight by Billboard, I don't see why a fandom's strength shouldn't be given similar respect - it's not like radio represents the most streamed/sold song, but the whim of the programmer. 

Currently, Lewis Capaldi's Before You Go (a song and artist I adore) is no 12 on radio; it's 62 on itunes, 116 on Spotify US, 117 on Apple Music. It's 18 on Billboard.

I think radio should be given some weight, since it's how a huge amount of people consume music - but given it's programmed, not streamed or sold, I don't see why a strong fanbase shouldn't override radio's impact. Taylor and BTS can both sell out stadiums - it's not like their impact is the result of label accounting.",1606780956

IMO neither the doc nor real time portrayals of MJ focus on ""anger"" being unlocked as the key to jordan's success

but do definitely focus on some kind of insult or disrespect (intended or otherwise and in fact real or imaginary)  as awakening his competitive fire (which I think most would agree and especially a mental health pro, is not the same thing as anger) and correspondingly that increased his focus - which is NOT a performance inhibitor the way the dr. notes anger is, but actually is a performance booster, which is right in line with MJ using that to rise to the challenge and ostensibly show up whomever disrespected him

i'm a little torn on what he says about ""people want to find emotional reasons... but really he won a lot and lost a lot based on talents not the slights and rising to the challenge"" because i think it's kind of a good point and applies to some degree

Then I remembered that those thoughts don't serve me, and so I would force myself to remember more hopeful days, and I would picture life as a timeline. 

Months are nothing compared to the potential for years ahead that I may be gifted to build greater things.

But honestly, you guys should upload pics on r/SwingersGW  and get attention maybe go on r/swingersr4r with a pic of yourselves. There are free blur apps available on google play so you can have privacy. 

Pictures are a powerful tool to getting notice. The wife and I post pics here, twitter, and on a private insta and we get contacted by mostly men, alot of couples, and occasionally a single lady who wants to play with us, from a divorcee, a semi professional pornstar, or a college age girl looking to experiment.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","I can totally relate! In 2017, I had plans for a fantasy series. Just like you I went wild with planning and worldbuilding and worked out all the complex fantasy politics and I even had family trees and a general timeline of the last few centuries of history. My first outline was HUGE, like 20+ pages. I knew what would happen in the first 28 chapters of the first book, I knew how it was going to end, but I didn't know *how* I was going to get to that ending. When it came to actually writing it, I was stuck. I wrote a chapter that I liked, but struggled to write the next chapter and just focused on worldbuilding again. I was still in University and was also working so I thought ""I don't have the time to write this; I'll wait till I graduate.""


Well, 2019 rolls around and I graduate and land myself a career, and by then I still only had like two chapters written and still kept trying to say ""I don't have time to write this."" But like you, the idea always stuck with me. The characters were alive in my head and I could just *imagine* them walking around and talking and I needed to get them on the page. I would occasionally open my reference docs and add a few bits of lore to the worldbuilding, but I otherwise left it alone for a LONG time. It got to a point where I was considering just turning the worldbuilding into a TTRPG setting to share with my friends because I thought I was never going to write the actual story, and I needed to do *something* with it. 


And then, somewhere around late August 2020, I started writing again. I was sick and taking time off from work and thought ""well, if my excuse is always going to be 'I don't have time to write' I've got time now!"" I wrote a shitty chapter, and then I wrote an excellent chapter. And then I just kept going. It was slow at first but by early October I *really* picked up momentum. Now I'm getting close to 70k words (it'll probably be 120k words when it's complete), having written about 30k words alone in the month of November even with 40-60 hour work weeks! Along the way I've overhauled my outline and found out how I'm actually going to write the climax. Once you pick up speed again, it'll be really hard to put it down!


Don't be discouraged. If you've got five chapters, you're already doing better than me. I was sitting on this idea for three years and only had two chapters to show for it! My biggest epiphany was when I realized I was never going to be 100% happy after re-reading something I wrote, but if I kept going back and revising the same few chapters over and over again I'd never make any progress. You gotta let it ""cool"" before you revise and nitpick and go ""omg it sucks"" because if you get stuck in a revision loop when you need to push forward and keep writing, it'll take the wind out of your sails.


Inspiration isn't something you can just force, but what helps me sometimes is looking back at those older chapters and remembering that energy from that time when you were excited about the idea. You mention that you get sad when you see your unfinished progress -- try to break out of that mindset and force yourself to read it all over again. All five chapters, and your notes on the world and characters too. Immerse yourself in the world again. Go back to the media that inspired you the most (oddly enough, for me it's playing Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, watching Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, and reading Malazan Book of the Fallen) and watch/play/read those favorites again, but also seek out new media to diversify your sources of inspiration. Reading more will make you want to write more, and it will make you a better writer!


 I also cannot stress the importance of having others read your work, whether they're friends and family or strangers from /r/betareaders. What really pumped me up was when I finally built up the courage to show my first three chapters to a friend, and he actually got upset that I didn't have more to show him because he really wanted to know what happened next! It's those little things that build your confidence, and you'll get helpful feedback along the way. Some of the feedback might not be helpful -- someone else said ""I like this character and I didn't like it that [horrible thing] happened to him!"" but I appreciated it all the same because it at least meant she was engaged with the story and characters!


I know it might hard to believe me in your current state of mind, but trust me when I say I've been there. It sucks feeling like your head is teeming with all these vibrant worlds and characters limited only by your ability to sit down and write them. It will come back. Don't try to force it. Just try to get back into that headspace that made you want to write in the first place.",1606780958
"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," A conta de luz ter√° tarifa extra a partir desta ter√ßa-feira (1¬∫), definiu a Aneel (Ag√™ncia Nacional de Energia El√©trica).

 De acordo com a reguladora, ser√° acionada a bandeira vermelha patamar 2 durante todo o m√™s de dezembro, o que representa uma cobran√ßa de R$ 6,24 a mais a cada 100 kWh consumidos.

 Esta √© a primeira vez desde o in√≠cio da pandemia de Covid-19 que a Aneel decide acionar uma bandeira tarif√°ria n√£o isenta de cobran√ßa.

 Em maio, a reguladora havia decidido manter a bandeira verde (sem cobran√ßa extra) acionada at√© 31 de dezembro, mas a queda no n√≠vel de armazenamento nos reservat√≥rios das hidrel√©tricas e a retomada do consumo de energia levaram √† revis√£o da decis√£o tomada em reuni√£o extraordin√°ria nesta segunda-feira (30).

 ### Bandeiras tarif√°rias

 Criado pela Aneel, o sistema de bandeiras tarif√°rias funciona como uma sinaliza√ß√£o para que o consumidor de energia el√©trica conhe√ßa, m√™s a m√™s, as condi√ß√µes e os custos de gera√ß√£o no pa√≠s.  
   
 Quando a produ√ß√£o nas usinas hidrel√©tricas (energia mais barata) est√° favor√°vel, aciona-se a bandeira verde, sem acr√©scimos na tarifa. Em condi√ß√µes ruins, podem ser acionadas as bandeiras amarela, vermelha 1 ou vermelha 2.  
   
 ‚ÄúCom o an√∫ncio da bandeira vermelha patamar 2 √© importante que os consumidores busquem evitar o desperd√≠cio de √°gua e energia‚Äù, disse o diretor-geral da ‚ÄãAneel, Andr√© Pepitone.  
   
 ***Bandeira verde***: condi√ß√µes favor√°veis de gera√ß√£o de energia. A tarifa n√£o sofre nenhum acr√©scimo.  
   
 ***Bandeira amarela***: condi√ß√µes de gera√ß√£o menos favor√°veis. A tarifa sofre acr√©scimo de R$ 1,34 por 100 kWh consumidos.

  ***Bandeira vermelha - Patamar 1***: condi√ß√µes mais custosas de gera√ß√£o. A tarifa sofre acr√©scimo de R$ 4,16 por 100 kWh consumidos.

 ***Bandeira vermelha - Patamar 2***: condi√ß√µes ainda mais custosas de gera√ß√£o. A tarifa sofre acr√©scimo de R$ 6,24 para cada 100 kWh.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","[Here are a few things that you can do to help you with general anxiety](https://old.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/wiki/onlineresources). It comes down to meditation, breathing exercises and using phone apps to reduce your anxiety.

You can double check if it is indeed general anxiety here: [11 Signs and Symptoms of Anxiety Disorders](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/anxiety-disorder-symptoms)

If you feel anxious right now, [open this image](https://i.imgur.com/Huou7Gh.gif) in a new tab and start breathing in and out in the rhythm of the image.

There are a *large* number of books that are aimed specifically at helping you, I've selected the most popular ones for you:

* [The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook](https://www.amazon.com/Anxiety-Phobia-Workbook-Edmund-Bourne/dp/1626252157/) (4.6 stars, 1200+ ratings)
* [Dare: The New Way to End Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Dare-Anxiety-Stop-Panic-Attacks/dp/0956596258) (4.7 stars, 1600+ ratings)
* [Badass Ways to End Anxiety &amp; Stop Panic Attacks! - A counterintuitive approach to recover and regain control of your life.: Die-Hard and Science-Based ... recover from Anxiety and Stop Panic Attacks](https://www.amazon.com/Badass-Ways-Anxiety-Panic-Attacks/dp/9090305262) (4.7 stars, 400+ ratings)

If you currently consume a lot of caffeine (in coffee or soft drinks), stop that. [Caffeine is known to cause anxiety](https://bebrainfit.com/caffeine-anxiety/)

Then here is the part you might not want to hear:

The best and quickest way to deal with anxiety, is to face your fear if possible.

[If you always avoid situations that scare you](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/publications/overcome-fear-anxiety/), you might stop doing things you want or need to do. You won't be able to test out whether the situation is always as bad as you expect, so you miss the chance to work out how to manage your fears and reduce your anxiety. Anxiety problems tend to increase if you get into this pattern. Exposing yourself to your fears can be an effective way of overcoming this anxiety.

*[The experience of anxiety involves nervous system arousal.](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/insight-therapy/201009/overcoming-fear-the-only-way-out-is-through) If your nervous system is not aroused, you cannot experience anxiety. Understandably, but unfortunately, most people attempt to cope with feelings of anxiety by avoiding situations or objects that elicit the feelings. Avoidance, however, prevents your nervous system from habituating. Therefore, avoidance guarantees that the feared object or situation will remain novel, and hence arousing, and hence anxiety provoking. Moreover, avoidance tends to generalize over time. If you avoid the elevator at work, you will soon begin to avoid all elevators, and then all buildings that house elevators. Soon enough, you'll be living in a prison of avoidance.*

If your anxiety is situational and not too extreme, you can try to address it through exposure therapy. You slowly carefully expose yourself to situations that you know give you fear. Here are two easy to follow guides on that. The one regarding spiders, is a blue print. You can replace spider with anything. Fear of driving. Fear of using a phone.

* [How to Overcome the Fear of Spiders](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-the-Fear-of-Spiders) (wikihow)
* [How to Overcome Fear](https://www.wikihow.com/Overcome-Fear) (wikihow)

For all of the below advice, use technology to your advantage. Take your phone and set repeating alarm clock reminders, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning/), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [Good sleep is very important when treating anxiety](https://www.anxiety.org/sleep-a-fundamental-cure-for-anxiety)
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, don't oversleep, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA/), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression#1) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues#1). If you find yourself often awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't look at the clock, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not all that long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers and starts thinking, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing, whatever you prefer. If that still doesn't work and you really want to sleep, [buy a dodow](https://www.amazon.com/Dodow-Device-300-000-Falling-Asleep/dp/B00ZFOB4BK/)($60) and/or a [white noise generator](https://www.amazon.com/Big-Red-Rooster-White-Machine) ($20).
* **Meditate**: [Anxiety can be reduced with meditation](https://bebrainfit.com/meditation-anxiety/). [10 minute meditation for anxiety](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-6f5wQXSu8) (youtube). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here if you have specific questions: /r/Meditation
* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on anxiety](https://www.calmclinic.com/anxiety/treatment/exercising) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.
* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work#benefits). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs/) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

Solid-State Sensor for ADAS, Autonomous Driving Targets $500 Price Point

https://www.electronicdesign.com/markets/automotive/article/21149041/solidstate-sensor-for-adas-autonomous-driving-targets-500-price-point

Solid-State Advantages

Solid-state LiDAR can provide increased range and resolution. This precision, combined with long-range detection, results in better classification of objects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles) and improved movement tracking‚Äîhow fast an object is moving and in which direction.

A solid-state design has another advantage: With no moving parts, the sensor is inherently less complex and fragile than other designs that rely on micro-mechanical spinning mirrors or other physical scanning mechanisms.

Now read all the info which was shared in FC3. It‚Äôs very clear that when April 2021 comes ..Microvision will be all over the mainstream media on its groundbreaking LRL module and the valuation will be arrived/realized and the market will take Microvision to a multi billion company valuation before the sale of the company!! It‚Äôs going to be a fact in Q2 2021!

Good luck everyone !!",1606780959

"Teachers","t5_2qqcs","I am so sorry.  That sounds like my last year.  I don't have anything that's going to fix things overnight, but what I'll say is that in my case, teacher presence was everything, followed by a really tangible follow-through on consequences (something which the wrong admin makes SO MUCH harder, ugh).

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding presence:  By the end of the day, I was exhausted, I was dreading the class, and I quickly lost hope with that class and that girl in particular.  Students pick up on that.  My dean (who was THE person who helped me at that school) told me to videotape myself teaching and troubleshoot presence.  Compare it with really effective teachers you've seen, or see on place like YouTube.  Sadly, the most effective ""presence"" for me early on happened when I was thinking ""I am blind with rage right now, but I'm going to speak in a level voice.""  That combination could shut even the second worst kid up.  Never shouting, never cowed, just ""you made me mad enough to shout, but I'm not going to.""  I'm not a person who gets angry easily, but that specific thing is something I played up as I saw how well it worked.  Now, having been given a fresh start, with a new year and a new school, I've been able to take that away and actually turn it into something that really works.  When kids start to think of trying something in my class now, I just use that tone, even if I don't feel angry, and they really do calm down.

This is particularly effective when you combine it with one of a few messages.  One good one is, ""Wow, you're old enough that I can't believe I'm actually having to tell you this"" message.  So much of what they do is because there's some cool factor in getting the best of a teacher, but you can easily turn that around and show them that they should be embarrassed by their behavior.  So, like this year a girl though it would be funny if she threw a cup of water in my class.  She's not totally unlike the student who almost singlehandedly wrecked my year last year.  ""There's no throwing water in class.  You're in 7th grade.  I should not be having to explain that to you.""  There are a couple others, but that's a good go-to.

&amp;#x200B;

Regarding consequences:  This is always so tricky.  If there's someone at your school who could help you brainstorm a few, that would be ideal.  Whatever it is, it has to be something the kid doesn't want, and that you can do with a high degree of regularity (meaning, enforceable by you, and something your admin won't mess up).  I was lucky enough to have that dean, who helped me come up with something feasible.  Only then did everything finally turn around.

&amp;#x200B;

Resetting:  Only after you have all of that somewhat figured out should you do this.  One problem I had last year was that my admin essentially made me do a reset (they wanted to practice a new type, and with my problems, I was the lucky one) before I had any ability to actually address the issues that came up.  That just made future resets more difficult because my students figured nothing would change.  But, once you've got a good plan on both your presence and your consequences, you reset.  And then, you practice, just like it's the first week of school.

&amp;#x200B;

If you pair those two things, you should be able to get that class under control, and actually relatively quickly.  I had the worst first year EVER, and even I made progress by the end using those two things.  Another thing I'll say is that you don't even need to try for a relationship with that girl until you've got her under control.  Controversial, I know, but I spent way too long trying for a relationship with my girl like that.  The relationship-building means less-than-nothing until the power dynamic changes.  Even this year, with my trouble girl, she's only receptive to the relationship building if I am firmly the one in control.  The minute she decides that maybe I'm weak and she can get the better of me, relationship-building attempts just make things worse.  When she knows she can't, then she'll participate in relationship stuff.  Until everything else is sorted out, don't even bother.  Relationship building can be part of your reset, for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit:  You might also look into something called no nonsense nurturing.  It helped another teacher who shared it with me, and did help me hone in on a couple things I was doing wrong.  

&amp;#x200B;

And some more advice.  One girl I worked (we were both AL people, but she had some private school teaching experience and was also going through a different program) said that her coach had told her ""Whatever your first rule/conflict is, that's the hill you need to die on.""  You don't lose that first battle.  What was your first battle with that class/girl?  That's the one you need to go back in time and fight until you win it.  Mine was a seating chart, and we honestly spent a whole class period just going into the hall and ""practicing"" going directly to our assigned seats and sitting there.  That act alone turned one of my classes around.  Literally the class that had made me break down in tears, turned into my best class and the class I now miss most of all, I think.  I know talking about power dynamics is horribly unfashionable, but at the end of the day, if they're unhealthy, they're unhealthy.  You find that first, most fundamental battle, you pick it and you win it.  That's the foundation on which everything else is built.  You win by doing those first two things.

"NintendoSwitch","t5_3h47q","&gt; dark souls (or demon souls) had unique elements seen very rarely before it

Dude you're just lying to yourself then.

None of the elements in Demon's Souls or Dark Souls were unique despite the overall package still being unique afterwards.

&gt; the difficulty

Just a ridiculous claim given the overall prevalence of difficult games in general. The term ""Nintendo hard"" literally exists. What made Demon's Souls stand out at the time was because games were typically veering towards ""easier"" or at least more well explained so it was unusual to have a game more like the older style of difficulty.

&gt; the storytelling

Also not new. This was a really typical way to give video game stories for a long time. Intro/Premise -&gt; gameplay (all unexplained) -&gt; basic cutscene -&gt; more gameplay (unexplained) -&gt; final boss -&gt; cutscene. What made Demon's Souls / Dark Souls stand out was the apparent consistency of it all. Whether or not that was true at the time, the playerbase seemed to agree that there was a larger implied lore. The same way say Castlevania has a larger implied lore, but people don't really care about it there (despite it doing the same thing in terms of storytelling).


&gt; the level design

You mean Zelda levels? They're literally Zelda dungeon designs. Of which have been done tons of times in all sorts of genres from action adventure to shooters to MMORPGs.

&gt; the progression systems

Seriously? How can you even bring this up as if it was even *close* to original? You seriously think the idea of one currency that you lose on death was new? XP leveling, XP as currency, corpse running, weapon upgrades, scaling weapons/abilities on stats, enemies that respawn on death/checkpoint so you can grind, these are *all* existing mechanics.





------


The crazy thing though is that I don't disagree with you in that Demon's Souls or Dark Souls ""invented"" a new genre or style of play/design. But it didn't do so by inventing new mechanics. It did so by putting them together and presenting them in a way that wasn't done before.

Which is similarly what people say about BotW despite it also using a variety of existing mechanics.


It's not that crazy that you can take existing ideas and mechanics and put them together into something new. It would be like saying someone can't paint something original without inventing a color.


------

&gt; what did botw have like that? nothing. it was an open world game like every other open world game ever made and slight variations.

So I feel like either this is a great misunderstanding about what other open world games had or presented or just a fanboy butthurt defensive reaction. Cause anyone could easily say the same thing about Demon's Souls. 

&gt; what did dark souls have like that? nothing. it was an action adventure game like every other action adventure ever made and slight variations.

Yeah, basically a true sentence. Doesn't actually say anything meaningful about Dark Souls or what it is or how it plays, but sure if you said that I would have a hard time disagreeing even as a huge fan of the series.",1606780960

No. It is unreasonable to think that the last 2 years has been an elaborate expensive ruse to alert Trump that he was being closely watched and investigated and then released in the hopes that he would do something deeper. You already had a thorough investigation.

They did not recommend charges because, as Mueller said, he was never going to recommend charges. He did not think it was his purview or even his ability to recommend charges. He thought it his position to compile the facts and deliver them to congress who, in his understanding, is the only body in the country legally allowed to hold a sitting president accountable.

One of the great faults of Mueller was that he waited until his briefing, handed over to a Trump appointee, to make that clear. He had ample time to express that, it would in no way have jeopardized his integrity, and it would have set up the public expectations more appropriately for the manner of his delivery.",1606780960

I used to play larger amounts of matches too, especially when WR just came out. I quickly found out that not only I get progressively more frustrated and enjoy the game less, but also that my decision-making takes a huge hit.

Since then I have been capping myself at around 4 ranked matches per day, and play norms if I feel like working on something or just want to play some more. My experience with the game has since improved significantly.

Different strokes for different people, but maybe something similar like capping the amount of ranked matches you play each day could be beneficial for you. I‚Äôm seeing some really helpful advice from others here too so feel free to experiment and see what works best for you.",1606780960

"Jung","t5_2s5nh","Couldn't find the source so I don't like interpreting this without context. 

So on the surface it sound's fine, but I'm very suspicious of attempts to make large prescriptive statements about the human condition and what people need to do to improve themselves as individuals. I do like the idea that people are ignoring the dark pole of things. I've seen it. They want all light and no dark, all pleasure and no pain. Anyone with an understanding of the world knows these can't be separated. 

I don't know I guess it just seems rather assumptive of what folks' problems are. Like I'm not convinced that this is a problem that most folks have nor am I so sure that these ""deeper planes of fulfillment"" are only open to those who solve this problem. There are probably lots of folks who find a satisfying life and purpose without ever resolving the opposites, and I wouldn't go so far as to assume that my experience or fulfillment having resolved them is better or deeper  than theirs. 

Again this is all really nitpicky. As motivational material being rather general this will appeal to a certain group of folks and they will find it extremely applicable and helpful to their situation.",1606780961

There's also commodity trading, see http://eddb.io for trade route tools. Pirates may try to stop you though.

When you make a bit more money, there's bounty hunting and mining as well, but this requires upgrades you probably don't have the cash for yet.

In practice [Christian Sarron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Sarron) falls in front of [Wayne Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Gardner), bringing him down and causing Gardner to race with broken ribs.

At the first turn, [Wayne Rainey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Rainey) and [Kevin Schwantz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Schwantz) go first, but [Pierfrancesco Chili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierfrancesco_Chili) gets knocked off by Gardner, who came across the racing line. Chili kicks furiously at the gravel as he's escorted off the track.

A trio forms at the front: Rainey, Schwantz and [Mick Doohan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Doohan). [Alex Barros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Barros) crashes out for a second race in a row.

Drops of rain bring out the red flag and memories of [Spa ‚Äô89](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1989_Belgian_motorcycle_Grand_Prix), when 3 races were run; a second race on aggregate time will follow. New start in the dry and Doohan gets the first turn, followed by Rainey and Mamola. It soon turns into Rainey, Doohan, Gardner and Schwantz at the front. It‚Äôs a very aggressive group of four, who pass each other two at a time.

Schwantz takes the lead, and can‚Äôt suppress his tic of looking back while exiting on the throttle, a habit that caused him a crash last season.

Though the order crossing the line is Schwantz, Gardner, Rainey and Doohan, Rainey takes the win based on aggregate time.",1606780962

no, your device simply went to sleep, and due to the way Google set up the stock firmware, it reset the legacy boot enable flag (dev_boot_legacy) and kicked you into recovery mode.

You have 2 options:  
1) use a [fixflags recovery image](https://galliumos.org/fixflags) to re-set the dev_boot_legacy flag  
2) reinstall ChromeOS via normal recovery media

Assuming you want to keep using GalliumOS, #1 is recommended. Then I would disable sleep/suspend, and set the firmware boot flags to ensure this doesn't happen again (requires disabling firmware write-protect)",1606780963

I was really optimistic &amp; feeling hopeful for Candiace when she started going to therapy (and coincidentally enough or not, watching her go through the shit with her mom convinced me to begin therapy, as well), but it seemed like she wanted to pass off a lot of the blame (her mom, Chris, now Monique) instead of also taking responsibility for her own part.

&amp;#x200B;

DONT PRE-STUDY FOR RESIDENCY. You have worked so hard your entire life, take the time to give your brain a little break. Residency is not necessarily hard but all of a sudden you are going to have a lot less free time than you did in medical school.

Find whatever hobby you are interested in and pursue it. Whether its sports, music, learning a new language, video games, ect. I ended up learning a decent amount of Spanish, got really into photography, learned how to play piano, and had honestly some of the best memories with my college/med school friends on Call of Duty Warzone (went from KD 0.2 to 1.1 which I am very proud of lol).

I was pretty neurotic in med school (as most of us are) as we lived test to test, shelf to shelf, board score to board score, and honestly lost track of my hobbies, other than working out (which started to become a chore). I honestly am so much happier now that I took the time to just relax and find things that I truly enjoy.

Just my 2 cents. I don't really feel like I'm behind anyone in knowledge basis having not touched a medical book in 6+ months before residency (...but I will probably be demolished on Step 3, but who cares :) )",1606780963

No it's not.  As long as you have 600W on the 12V rail(s) you have plenty of power to spare as long as you don't go overvolting the 9900K and 3080.  A 5600X+3080 system is about 575W maximum peak from the wall which at ~87% efficiency means what the PSU is actually supplying 500W max peak.  A stock 9900K system will be about 50W above that or 550W.  Again, that is *max peak*.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","&gt;The 36-year old revealed he had had a bone spur removed from his ankle and had back surgery to deal with sciatica during the pandemic and it had left him relatively pain-free for the first time in years.

A lot of NBL fans saw this coming. He hasn't had a fully healthy season in a long time, and even with his incredible contribution to the Warriors and the Australian national team, it's sad that the 'what if' question will likely follow him in any career retrospective. 

Bogut was one of the most fundamentally sound big men in an era where there weren't many skilled centers. He came into the league with a higher BBIQ than most of his peers, scoring with either hand and making better passes than most college point guards. When burdened by injuries he never lost a step when it came to his playmaking, which is how the Warriors were able to extract so much value out of him.

All said, he's a legend of the sport for Aussie fans and I'm sure Warriors fans feel exactly the same way.",1606780965

"MoDaoZuShi","t5_qg5fl","I think they are very much in-character in nsfw scenes. You mentioned already how LWJ kissed WWX which wasn't consensual ether. It showed how much restraint LWJ is having over himself and we see it break from time to time. There's also the biting bit Xuanwu cave. Everything points that LWJ's dream isn't out of character, similarly how WWX's is about the farm and more family oriented. I personally wouldn't have know just the *amount* of feelings that LWJ has due to the fact the novel is in WWX's pov. It took me until the kiss scene to actually understand the biting.And perhaps LWJ's restrain got better after 13 years of waiting, so it ended with WWX jumping him. WWX was more of a buildup that started as a way to disgust LWJ. He made a lot of bold flirting as MXY but even after that, he continued his teasing of LWJ. That scene at a farm(?) comes to my mind, WWX was the initiator there too. First two drunk scenes also helped to accumulate what happened at the bath scene. So I personally don't see it as not pushing the story, but more as seeing the characters lose themselves around the person they love.

We know for a fact that both LWJ and WWX have a rape kink, it's why WWX was barely shaken and more turned on by LWJ's dream. It was literally double fictional non-con, it never  happened to ether LWJ or WWX. It's also not uncommon for people to get off of pain, WWX was encouraging him during their first time (at least thats the signals I got?). I doubt they were thoughtless outbursts from WWX. They are a very kinky couple so I wouldn't be surprised from even more eyebrow raising stuff from them.

Honestly, I really love MXTX's smut bits and the Wangxian slips. I personally love roughish play compared to fluff smut. She manages to slide in the story along it which is a good feat compared to pure smut chapter or scene. Incense Burner are optional chapters with warnings put up, so it's logical to skip them if they make you uncomfortable. Which is the furthest way I feel and I will never feel bad for enjoying them.

Just my two cents.

Until you convince your SO that it is truly a deal breaker for you there will be no change. She has what she needs in the marriage and maybe feels you should be happy with what you have.  You will have to see things from her perspective in order for you to make her really understand you side of it..

"PoliceBrutality2020","t5_2prfum","She's not innocent. My point is its excessive to throw an old lady to the ground over a simple moving violation. She totally should have complied. No question. But the cops not only knew her plate number, her ID but at the beginning of the clip the cop SAYS HE KNOWS HER SON. Let her go. Go to her house the next day and arrest her. Talk to her son and ask him to resolve the situation. Send her a summons in the mail. There are many more options than using physical force.

Let me put it like this... Lets say you stole something. Lets say the punishment is to have your hands chopped off. Should you have stolen that pack of gum? Probably not, but now you have no hands. Is that justice?

Lets put it another way. George Floyd was killed over $10 counterfeit note, effectively making his life worth less than the $10 debt to a fucking convenience store that pulls in so much money $10 is a drop in the bucket. Shit. Lets say he swindled a guy out of his last $10. That's still not justified. He sure as shit resisted, but at what point can they say its just not worth it? They should but they don't.

What we have in the country is a gang of armed and poorly trained assholes that can make you comply for any reason, no matter how small, by threat of death. And don't get me wrong. Its not just a cops mentality I argue with. I'd be an asshole too if I was asked to enforce every tiny rule with minimal training to effectively do my job.

Defund the police. Give calls for mental breakdowns to social workers and nurses like in Canada. It works great. ( Side note. I dated a nurse that did just that if you want to know more about what she does or her story. Its a very strong argument for more social safety nets).

Xenos species that are peaceful are either not relevant in the galactic scene or wiped out due to the imperium's blanket policy on aliens.


I guess the issue is that some of the Imperium's policies are *explanied* wich is not the same as *justified*. When magic is unstable and very dangerous, is taking a hard stance against it unreasonable? When the most prolific alien species actively seek to wipe out humanity are precautionary measures really that uncalled for? When the universe really *is* out to get you, is it a bad idea to be paranoid? 

Food for thought, i guess.",1606780967
"ITManagers","t5_2tl26","Hello! I've been in your exact spot. Graduated with an ITM degree but was a CS major for a couple of years. Others may have different opinions on this, but I'll share my experience. In this field, having a specific degree doesn't get you the job, your experience, and how you present yourself does. 

While earning my degree I was working at the University IT Help Desk. That job gave me so much great experience and I learned a lot. My biggest takeaways were learning how to troubleshoot and how to work with people. Help Desk can be both exhausting and fun, it depends on your team and environment. That kind of direct IT experience will be a lot more applicable when you begin the hunt for full-time employment. Employers want to see how you've interacted with real problems and how to contribute to the team dynamic. It certainly doesn't hurt to have a completed degree, as some places require it for employment.

For me, I went on to do full-time tier 2 tech support at a different smaller university and just recently moved up to IT Operations Manager. 

Keep working hard and looking for chances to learn new things. Happy to answer any other questions you might have. Best of luck!",1606780967

&gt; MANAGEMENT RIGHTS

&gt; Each Club, and, **where appropriate, the League,** in the exercise of its functions of management, shall in addition to its other inherent and legal rights to manage its business, including the direction and control of its team, **have the right at any time** and from time to time to determine when, where, how and under what circumstances **it wishes to operate, suspend, discontinue,** sell or move and to determine the manner and the rules by which its team shall play hockey. Nothing in this Article shall, however, authorize a Club or the League to violate any provision of this Agreement or of any SPC.

&gt; All of the rights which were inherent in each Club and where appropriate the League, as owner and operator of its business, including its team, or incident to the management thereof, which existed prior to the selection of the NHLPA as exclusive bargaining representative by the Players and which are not expressly curtailed or contracted away by a specific provision of this Agreement or by any SPC are retained solely by each Club. A Club, and where appropriate the League, may take any action not in violation of any applicable provision of this Agreement, any SPC, or law in the exercise of its management rights

Sounds pretty carte blanche to me. And it doesn't sound like they need any better reason than ""we will lose money.""

Unless you can find me a provision that they are violating.

EDIT: But I do agree, using this clause to ""renegotiate an MOU"" agreed upon just 4 months prior is definitely in bad faith. Perhaps the NHLPA would win a court battle with that argument plus Article 7.",1606780969

"army","t5_2qtr8","Dealers will always make business, not trades.

They will hand you a new car on a diamond platter, but will try to sell you a used one like a foreign trade deal. They have to rotate stock, but a used car costs them money to keep and they want that burden passed on to the buyer. 

The car is a 2015 Mazda 6 iGT(with updated firmware). It had 53k miles and was going for $13647. NO dealer will EVER sell a car that modern or used for THAT price. That's the lowest market range it will sell for, but they will not sleep on it's actual value which is at least $16k. 

The only reason the price was negotiable was because the car had been neglected. It had also been sitting in the lot for a month and it looked like shit. It was an easy steal of a car as it only needed some reconditioning and a duly full service. It's a Japanese car, so it's a robust and easy-to-work on vehicle. 

We came to an offer of $13827 because it was missing fluids, a recall(low risk), worn brakes, bald tires, and overdue service judging from the sound of the injectors. I brought them my bank's financing which was 5.8%. It was a decimating offer to them, they just didn't know how bad it was.

They wanted to get as much money out of me as possible while getting rid of the burden. Nonetheless, their lack of care for the vehicle cost them money and did it for free anyway(new tires, brakes, etc). The only way they get that money back is through their lenders. 

 So, I took the car at their financing, which I am already have 3/4 payed off. Essentially, buying the car in cash, which is the bane of dealerships as it eliminates the profit off of interest. I just did it to get it off the lot. It is that good of a car and opportunity that I went to such lengths to get it.",1606780970

My BoE is very supportive and is actually helping me in this situation, even though I lose out on all the benefits (key money, renewal fees, free bicycle rental, and short commute time) which is way more than I expected to get honestly. Wherever you might be stationed may not be so kind, and you have to keep that in mind. ALSO I want to point out, paying out the ass is not always the case. It really all depends.

Pet friendly housing is more expensive, but its your location that'll really eat your expenses. For example, I'm stationed in Uji City, around 30 minutes out of Kyoto city by train. Uji currently has no pet friendly apartments, but my preds report a rent for around 55k yen for 1K apartments. The pet friendly 1K apartment I'm looking at in Fushimi is around 61K yen, which does fit within my desired budget. WOULD I LIKE TO PAY LESS? Absolutely, but it's still very affordable. But you have a dog, not a cat. You may not be able to function in a 1K unless your dog is small, so your price will be going up for space. Again, it's all dependent on everything, but I will say you should plan ahead - and plan for paying for *everything*.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," ‚ÄãA √∫nica preserva√ß√£o garantida pelo governo federal durante o an√∫ncio da taxa anual de desmatamento na Amaz√¥nia √© a do ministro do Meio Ambiente, Ricardo Salles, ausente na cerim√¥nia que contou com o ministro Marcos Pontes (Ci√™ncia e Tecnologia) e o vice-presidente Hamilton Mour√£o.

 [A alta seguida no desmatamento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2020/11/desmatamento-na-amazonia-volta-a-bater-recorde-e-cresce-9.shtml) seria mais um momento de exposi√ß√£o negativa para a imagem do ministro, que j√° [coleciona desgastes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painel/2020/10/ministro-ricardo-salles-chama-rodrigo-maia-de-nhonho-em-rede-social.shtml). Seu poder no comando da pasta, no entanto, continua intacto e, ainda, protegido pelo papel de rela√ß√µes p√∫blicas de Mour√£o, √† frente do Conselho da Amaz√¥nia.

 O vice-presidente reconheceu, em coletiva de imprensa durante o an√∫ncio, que as For√ßas Armadas n√£o t√™m papel de fiscalizar, mas de dar apoio log√≠stico aos agentes do Ibama e do ICMBio ‚Äî√≥rg√£os que seguem sob o comando de Salles.

 Desde que assumiu o papel de porta-voz para a Amaz√¥nia, no in√≠cio do ano, Mour√£o tenta transmitir tranquilidade ao anunciar altas em taxas que j√° eram recorde.

 O atual aumento de 9,5% no desmate anual da Amaz√¥nia se sobrep√µe a uma alta recorde no per√≠odo anterior, [que disparou 34% na transi√ß√£o dos governos Temer e Bolsonaro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/11/desmatamento-na-amazonia-bate-recorde-e-cresce-295-em-12-meses.shtml) ‚Äîo salto superou as oscila√ß√µes de taxas de desmatamento dos anos 1990, per√≠odo anterior aos investimentos em pol√≠ticas de controle ambiental.

 Os avan√ßos nas pol√≠ticas de controle ambiental atravessaram governos FHC, Lula, Dilma e Temer, de modo que desde 2008 o pa√≠s mantinha as taxas de desmatamento da Amaz√¥nia abaixo dos 10 mil km2.

  O que acontece agora ‚Äîcom a taxa atual de 11.088 km2 de desmatamento, seguida dos 10.129 km2 no ano anterior ‚Äî√© um retorno acelerado na dire√ß√£o do descontrole ambiental.

 No entanto, n√£o podemos voltar no tempo. Existe um outro n√∫mero que n√£o oscila, mas apenas acumula e marca um limite natural: o desmatamento acumulado desde que o monitoramento foi iniciado, em 1989, chega a 814.025 km2, e ultrapassa 20% do total do territ√≥rio amaz√¥nico.

 Embora a conta n√£o registre eventuais √°reas recuperadas, ela inexoravelmente nos posiciona √† beira do abismo, ou exatamente em cima do ponto de n√£o retorno calculado pela [teoria de savaniza√ß√£o da Amaz√¥nia.](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2020/10/mudanca-climatica-pode-transformar-em-savana-40-da-amazonia-indica-estudo.shtml)

 Segundo o climatologista Carlos Nobre, a resili√™ncia e a capacidade de regenera√ß√£o natural da floresta amaz√¥nica fica amea√ßada a partir da devasta√ß√£o de 20% a 25% do seu territ√≥rio, iniciando um caminho ‚Äîj√° refor√ßado pelas mudan√ßas clim√°ticas ‚Äî [de savaniza√ß√£o, quando a Amaz√¥nia perde suas caracter√≠sticas ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ciencia/2020/10/mudanca-climatica-pode-transformar-em-savana-40-da-amazonia-indica-estudo.shtml)e passa a se parecer mais com o cerrado, com altera√ß√µes em seu regime de chuvas, no clima, no abastecimento h√≠drico e tamb√©m na economia agr√≠cola no restante do pa√≠s.

 Vivemos uma aproxima√ß√£o dos limites planet√°rios em 2020, quando as mudan√ßas clim√°ticas j√° se imp√µem como um fator presente e n√£o mais uma proje√ß√£o, e esse contexto tamb√©m eleva a preocupa√ß√£o internacional sobre a prote√ß√£o da maior floresta tropical do mundo.

 O recado dado por embaixadores de pa√≠ses europeus, [por investidores estrangeiros ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/06/investidores-pressionam-brasil-para-proteger-amazonia-e-geram-alerta-na-equipe-economica.shtml)e at√© por empres√°rios brasileiros, em diversas reuni√µes com Mour√£o ao longo deste ano, foi claro: a taxa de desmatamento precisa cair.

 Por mais que os discursos sejam promissores e outros projetos sejam tamb√©m importantes, o governo sempre ser√° medido e cobrado pelo controle do desmatamento. No Brasil, este √© o sinal m√≠nimo de comprometimento com uma pol√≠tica ambiental.

 Embora n√£o dialoguem com a sociedade civil organizada, Salles e Mour√£o ainda ter√£o que explicar aos seus interlocutores do mercado e das rela√ß√µes internacionais como o discurso ao longo de 2020 resultou em uma alta em cima de uma taxa que j√° era recorde.

 A Justi√ßa tamb√©m aguarda explica√ß√µes. Al√©m de diversas a√ß√µes contra a gest√£o de Ricardo Salles nos tribunais, boa parte iniciada pelo Minist√©rio P√∫blico, uma a√ß√£o no Tribunal de Contas da Uni√£o tamb√©m pede investiga√ß√£o sobre a destina√ß√£o de R$ 60 milh√µes mensais do Ex√©rcito para fiscaliza√ß√£o ambiental enquanto o or√ßamento anual do Ibama √© de R$ 70 milh√µes.

 Como um aumento exponencial do investimento em fiscaliza√ß√£o com a divulgada Opera√ß√£o Verde Brasil 2 resulta em nova alta no desmatamento? [A **Folha** havia revelado em maio que a primeira miss√£o comandada por Mour√£o](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2020/05/exercito-ignora-ibama-mobiliza-97-agentes-e-faz-vistoria-sem-punicao.shtml) mobilizou 97 agentes, dois helic√≥pteros e dezenas de viaturas em Mato Grosso para uma opera√ß√£o que terminou sem multas, pris√µes ou apreens√µes.

 A taxa de 11.088 km2 de desmatamento anunciada nesta segunda-feira se refere ao per√≠odo de agosto de 2019 a julho deste ano, abarcando o pico de desmatamento ocorrido entre agosto e setembro do √∫ltimo ano.

 O per√≠odo contou com epis√≥dios organizados como [o Dia do Fogo, no Par√°](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ambiente/2019/10/fazendeiros-e-empresarios-organizaram-dia-do-fogo-apontam-investigacoes.shtml), e gerou uma crise pol√≠tica de propor√ß√µes internacionais, cujos embara√ßos s√£o colhidos at√© hoje pelo pa√≠s em forma de cobran√ßas diplom√°ticas e amea√ßas de boicotes de produtos brasileiros ligados a desmatamento.

 No entanto, a conta assumida por Mour√£o neste ano n√£o contou com nenhum al√≠vio. T√£o logo o bioma voltou ao per√≠odo seco, em maio, os alertas de desmatamento voltaram a se aproximar dos n√∫meros do ano passado, com ""leves altas"" em cima de taxas que j√° eram recorde.

 Ou seja, o resultado no acumulado do ano n√£o representava novidade ou surpresa de √∫ltima hora para o governo, que j√° vinha lidando com constrangimentos gerados no in√≠cio do per√≠odo calculado pelo Prodes.

 Enquanto o vice-presidente Mour√£o insiste no malabarismo de controlar a imagem internacional do Brasil sem exercer o controle ambiental na Amaz√¥nia, o projeto antiambiental do governo Bolsonaro segue sem ressalvas. √Ä beira do ponto de n√£o retorno, aceleramos.",1606780971

You made a unilateral decision in your marriage and justified it with purely legal scrutiny, then  tried to soften it with ""btw my degree wuz hard n im devastated and miserable so plz consider that"". What is step 2 of this great plan? Drive your kids to a new city and look for an apartment, let your wife find out the kids are gone and have her call you to see what's going on?  

YTA and more. Do you even relationship, bro? You keep talking until you agree. If you can't ever agree, after several months/few years start talking about moving to a nearby city and having an LTR or possibly separation. Compromise is an essential component for any successful living situation. People need to work shit out or they shouldn't be in a relationship. I can't answer that for you, but this? You've shot your marriage in the leg, because you had the legal ability to force your wife's hand. that is a FUCKING DICK MOVE, pal.

I think the initial attraction can be very intense in those situations because you are exactly what they need during that time.

""Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.‚Äî**In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols.** We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.""",1606780972

&amp;nbsp;

You could have a gas giant planet ~1 Jupiter mass orbiting around a 13 or so Jupiter mass planet. Problem is you dont have a ""gas"" planet as the name gas giant is a bit misleading (Typically in astronomy/astrophysics we actually use the term giant planet rather than gas giant). Most of Jupiter is in fact in a fluid state rather than gas. Even if you relax this assumption, to say fluid rather than gas, then still not really because low mass giant planets are expected to have rocky cores (which may or may not be in a mushy state). Only the upper mass giant planets are fully fluid (formed by the gravitational instability mechanism).

&amp;nbsp;

As a bonus. It is possible if you relax the requirements to fluid rather than gas and then ignore the IAU's (poor) definition of planet in favour of one that defines it by formation pathway. This means you could include a large number of brown dwarf planets and hence have a high mas giant planet orbit a brown dwarf planet. But this then becomes a question of definition rather than telling you too much about the physics.",1606780973

But I'm sure that their ideology of ""PVP"" (of which doesn't hardly exist anymore now that Survival has been gone), would be an equal playing field. Especially for Nuclear Winter.

Don't get me wrong, I give them credit where it's due. But it's a little baffling that they can't even consider a 60FPS option for next-gen. I can't imagine them killing off last gen support anytime soon either just to appease the players on current gen (very weird to say LOL).",1606780973

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Olha, o problema √© a hierarquia e a aproxima√ß√£o judicial aos estatutos que disciplinam a atividade militar. PM √© servidor p√∫blico militar, quadro auxiliar das For√ßas Armadas.

A hierarquia pode ser uma ben√ß√£o ou uma maldi√ß√£o: um oficial pode dar conta de 10 soldados corruptos E 100 soldados honestos n√£o tem como cuidar (dentro da lei) de um oficial corrupto e, pior, podem ser corrompidos at√© de maneira involunt√°ria.

Porque ele pode punir indiscriminadamente e a justi√ßa N√ÉO VAI entrar nesse m√©rito, a n√£o ser que o soldado (pasm√©m), consiga PROVAR que n√£o teve o direito √†s ampla defesa resguardado.

Obviamente ele n√£o ter√° esses recursos, que demandam assist√™ncia jur√≠dica super especializada e uma boa dose de boa vontade da corpora√ß√£o. Submetida, novamente, √†s hierarquia.

As corregedorias t√™m avan√ßado, mas n√£o o suficiente para coibir abuso de autoridade e corrup√ß√£o em geral: policial na corregedoria n√£o est√° na rua. Isso n√£o ganha voto, viatura na rua ganha voto.

Consequentemente, or√ßamento. Or√ßamento √© o sangue do √≥rg√£o p√∫blico e, mais do que isso, o ponto focal da carreira, algo extremamente importante para QUALQUER servidor p√∫blico, aqui ou l√° fora.

De maneira geral, a maioria √© gente honesta, mas corruptos bem posicionados conseguem destruir a reputa√ß√£o e o trabalho deles, f√°cil f√°cil.

A pol√≠cia precisa ser desmilitarizada, tornando as barreiras hierarquicas menores, tornando-se uma organiza√ß√£o mais simples e mais f√°cil de fiscalizar, considerando sua atividade, provavelmente mais aberta aos mecanismos de controladoria que funcionam: a externa especializada e o controle social.

Hierarquia serve para for√ßas armadas, que ficam dentro da caserna (e, de modo geral, mais isoladas da corrup√ß√£o comum) e preparadas para conflitos de larga escala, nesse ponto ela se torna fundamental.

E seu pessoal precisa ser muito mais bem selecionado. Existe muito policial que se sente autoridade, que se sente √† vontade em atacar a dignidade e a incolumidade f√≠sica e ps√≠quica das pessoas, especialmente pobres. N√£o precisa ser a maioria: basta 3-4 para causar terror numa cidade m√©dia. Isso √© o que acontece, a morte das pessoas pobres e, especialmente negras, nas m√£os da pol√≠cia √© um problema s√©rio.

A mudan√ßa de pensamento em rela√ß√£o √† pol√≠cia pode, mesmo, induzir ao repensar da seguran√ßa p√∫blica que, aqui, √© marcada por esquadr√µes da morte e aproxima√ß√£o vingativa da sociedade, mesmo que fora das inst√¢ncias competentes, e reverbera na vis√£o social da corrup√ß√£o da pol√≠cia (contanto que estejam extorquindo traficantes e ladr√µes, a sociedade aplaude, e √© o que eles fazem) e da toler√¢ncia aos policiais potencialmente violentos (tem cara de bandido, se matar a sociedade n√£o liga).",1606780975

"ukpolitics","t5_2qhcv","&gt;Ehhh, are you joking or did you miss the entire media hoopla and Corbyn‚Äôs suspension? Because it seems you are very confused at this point. 

Go back and look at the social media between the time that the report was released and when Corbyn was suspended (and, to a large degree, for the following days and weeks).

Reddit and Twitter was awash with Corbyn outriders outraged by a report they had clearly not read (especially on the first day) and that this was an attack on Corbyn, that it had been orchestrated by Starmer and the Blairites, that the EHRC was biased puppets of the Tories and (unironically) the pro-Israel lobby.

Of course, this blew up when that evening Corbyn was suspended for dismissing the accusations of antisemitism as being overblown by the media using language that seemed purposefully mimicking a line in the conclusion to the reports findings (which explicitly said that dismissing or minimising accusations of antisemitism was in itself a form of antisemitism). 

Corbyn was suspended not for the findings in the report, *but for dismissing the report in the way that he did as per the antisemitism complaints procedure which was put in place under his leadership.*

It wasn't until perhaps a week later that you *started* to see the Corbyn outriders being to actually acknowledge that the report wasn't actually critical of Corbyn, but rather making valid observations of deficiencies in the complaints procedure (including acknowledgement that improvements had been made). *Despite this, and to this day, you can still see people dismissing the report as a personal attack on Corbyn...*

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;So we agree it improved under Corbyn and it was worse before? And that definitely more could have been done. 

Those were the findings of the report, and I see no reason to dispute them. Having said that, it was clear from the report that there was a surfeit of complaints (and not enough resources to handle them) so it was wrong for the Labour leadership to claim at the time that it was a issue which had been handled as a priority.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; Nor does any evidence exist antisemitic acts were more common under Corbyn than prior leaders? 

I could not say one way or another. This was not covered by the report and I don't have access to any quantitative data to confirm or deny what you claim. All I know is that there is (or were) over a thousand outstanding complaints - whether that is more or less than before Corbyn I do not know.

But you're going down a similar path as the people who think the report (or the suspension) was an attack on Corbyn. You have to understand that the report doesn't condemn him, but neither does it vindicate him. This whole spectacle is less about the report and more about Corbyn's response to it.",1606780975

As a result they A. look for any reason to throw your resume out (not sticking to the standard is one of those reasons) and B. they only skim each resume for like 20 seconds tops. If your resume is more than one page it pisses them off because it‚Äôs more time they have to dedicate to it.

I haven‚Äôt played an AC game since literally the first one, so I have no idea what crazy stuff is happening in the real world storyline, but I‚Äôm interested enough in the main games story to finish up. No reason not to when I‚Äôm so close now.

I feel like the game is SUPER easy. I‚Äôm on the hardest mode with the most alert guard settings and it‚Äôs pretty easy to just assassinate a whole camp undetected. I stopped leveling at 277 power because there is an achievement at 280 and I figured I‚Äôd hold myself there just so the game stopped getting easier. Even then though, I‚Äôve killed all the 400 power level fights no problem.

I actually wish they didn‚Äôt make it so you could get every skill. It‚Äôd be nice to have interesting choices as you level.

Gear is fine enough, though once you find the armor set that suits your play style that‚Äôs it. Upgrading gear to max is extremely easy since the game drowns you in materials.

I‚Äôd expect to be 100% finished within 10 more hours or so, except I‚Äôve run into a pretty common bug preventing me from fighting a boss. I‚Äôm hoping that‚Äôs fixed next patch so I can get my last achievement.",1606780977

Q - What if I run out of minutes/texts/data in the middle of the 30 day cycle?

If you run out of your allotted credit per 30 day cycle, don't sweat, we don't charge pricey overages. However, you won't be able to use that specific service that was exhausted until your next 30 day cycle renews. So if you run out of minutes only, you could still text and surf the web. If you need more credit mid-cycle, we offer two options: a $2 and a $5 option.

$2 option: 100 minutes or 100 texts or 100 MB of data @ The Highest Speed
$5 option: 250 minutes or 500 texts or 250 MB of data @ The Highest Speed

The credit does not roll over cycle to cycle so if you add 500 minutes with two days left before your 30 day cycle is over, you will only have two days to use the 500 minutes.",1606780978

"Qult_Headquarters","t5_in7k7","&gt; but it‚Äôs not nothing and it‚Äôs worth considering. 

 But it pretty much is nothing:

&gt;I have not been granted access to examine any of the systems used in the 2020 Election. However, I have conducted detailed analysis of the NY Times data sets and have discovered significant anomalies are caused by fraudulent manipulation of the results. 

He's claiming fraud but he doesn't even attempt to get the data from the counties themselves and rather relies on the NYT? 

The NYT aggregates their data and it's certainly possible that they messed up somewhere so shouldn't one analyze the official vote counts instead of the TV vote counts? 

Continuing on, it's almost like he wasn't aware of how Pennsylvania counts their votes:

&gt;A sudden rise in slope is not normal and demonstrates data manipulation by artificial means. For example in PA,  
&gt;  
&gt;President Trump‚Äôs lead  
&gt;  
&gt;of more than 700,000 count advantage was reduced to less than 300,000 in a few short hours, which does not occur in the real world without an external influence.

This was predicted prior to the election because PA wasn't allowed to count mail-in ballots early so the ""blue shift"" was fully expected. 

&gt;  In another case for Edison County, MI, Vice President Biden received more than 100% of the votes at 5:59 PM EST on November 4,2020 and again he received 99.61% of the votes at 2:23 PM EST on November 5, 2020. These distributions are cause for concern and indicate fraud 

Edison county? Where is this fabled county?

&gt; I conclude with high confidence that the election 2020 data were altered in all battleground states resulting in a hundreds of thousands of votes that were cast for President Trump to be transferred to Vice President Biden. These alterations were the result of systemic and widespread exploitable vulnerabilities in DVS, Scytl/SOE Software and Smartmatic systems that enabled operators to achieve the desired results. In my view, the evidence is overwhelming and incontrovertible 

Yet he provides us none of the evidence and just expects that we live in the same fantasy land where it was already proven that votes were tabulated overseas, etc, etc.",1606780978

How you deal with situations in the field where things don't go according to plan and you have to improvise.

Yes you're still fertile, you _could_ have another child, but _why_ do you want one, and _should_ you really entertain this idea anymore? Are you frustrated because the option has been taken away from you? Do you have more options?

Ya think most women would‚Äôve had it all fall into place for them  just a perfectly if they pulled what OP did? The fact that OP choose to go behind people‚Äôs backs including the person he screwed over makes him TA. Homie didn‚Äôt even give her a heads up or let her know it wasn‚Äôt personal before pulling that. It‚Äôs not only the act itself (motivations/whatever ‚Äújustification‚Äù aside) but the way they went about the act. It doesn‚Äôt matter if OP was actually right or not cause maybe they did deserve it. But if they felt it was about gender then they should‚Äôve said something directly to the people he actually had a problem with. If you  can‚Äôt speak up for yourself when it counts and instead wait to be sneaky rather then communicate his issues in a way that wouldnt fuck over his coworkers at the end of the day then maybe his supervisors had a point about him not being the right person.

We no longer talk but that's besides the point.

I had a DA who disappeared 2 months ago and that's the end of that story. If I could have a conversation with him I would love to.

I think the moral of your story is that after 3 months you thought your DA would be open or healed a bit more to be on more friendly terms and that is not the case. It can be disappointing. I also mourn the loss of my friendship with my disappearing DA more than the love. I just want him to come pick me up and go for a drive around the city or go to the mall and hang out like we used to. I still want the D tho so I gotta be careful about that one. I am learning as well that for some DAs a day is like a minute. So a month is like half an hour. Maybe they need at least a couple hours, aka like 6+ months or a lifetime lol.

 Aos domingos, segundas-feiras e feriados os n√∫meros da pandemia costumam ser menores por causa de atrasos de notifica√ß√£o das secretarias de sa√∫de.

 Al√©m dos dados di√°rios do cons√≥rcio, a **Folha **tamb√©m mostra a chamada m√©dia m√≥vel. O recurso estat√≠stico busca dar uma vis√£o melhor da evolu√ß√£o da doen√ßa, pois atenua n√∫meros isolados que fujam do padr√£o. A m√©dia m√≥vel √© calculada somando o resultado dos √∫ltimos sete dias, dividindo por sete.

 De acordo com os dados coletados at√© as 20h, a m√©dia de mortes nos √∫ltimos sete dias √© de 518, aumento de 6% em rela√ß√£o a 14 dias atr√°s, o que representa um cen√°rio de estabilidade de mortes. Nas √∫ltimas semanas, o pa√≠s variou entre situa√ß√µes de queda da m√©dia, chegando a uma estabilidade posterior e, recentemente, passando a apresentar crescimentos.

 A m√©dia recente, por√©m, foi afetada por um apag√£o de dados de alguns estados. De toda forma, dados do pa√≠s e especialistas que os acompanham t√™m apontado tend√™ncias de[ aumento de casos de Covid-19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/11/seis-capitais-tem-mais-de-80-de-lotacao-de-utis-para-covid-19.shtml), o que normalmente precede o crescimento das mortes pela doen√ßa.

  Os dados s√£o fruto de[ colabora√ß√£o in√©dita](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/veiculos-de-comunicacao-formam-parceria-para-dar-transparencia-a-dados-de-covid-19.shtml) entre **Folha**, UOL, O Estado de S. Paulo, Extra, O Globo e G1 para reunir e divulgar os n√∫meros relativos √† pandemia do novo coronav√≠rus. As informa√ß√µes s√£o coletadas diretamente com as Secretarias de Sa√∫de estaduais.

 Norte e Sul s√£o as regi√µes que apresentam crescimento da m√©dia m√≥vel de mortes. Nordeste e Sudeste est√£o em situa√ß√£o de estabilidade e o Centro-Oeste em queda.

 Acre, Amazonas, Cear√°, Esp√≠rito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Rond√¥nia, Santa Catarina e Sergipe tiveram aumento da m√©dia m√≥vel de mortes em rela√ß√£o a 14 dias atr√°s.

 Bahia, Maranh√£o, Par√°, Paran√°, Pernambuco e S√£o Paulo est√£o em situa√ß√£o de estabilidade. Os demais estados e o Distrito Federal apresentam queda. 

 O Brasil tem uma taxa de 82,7 mortos por 100 mil habitantes. Os Estados Unidos, que t√™m o maior n√∫mero absoluto de mortos (267.792), e o Reino Unido (58.545), ambos √† frente do Brasil na pandemia (ou seja, come√ßaram a sofrer com o problema antes), t√™m 82 e 88,1 mortos para cada 100 mil habitantes, respectivamente.

 O Brasil havia ultrapassado a taxa da It√°lia de mortes por 100 mil habitantes (92), pa√≠s com 55.576 √≥bitos pela doen√ßa. Contudo, com a segunda onda que assola a Europa, a It√°lia voltou a passar o Brasil.

 O M√©xico, que ultrapassou o Reino Unido em n√∫mero de mortos e j√° contabiliza 105.655 √≥bitos, tem 83,7 mortes para cada 100 mil habitantes.

 Na Am√©rica do Sul, chama a aten√ß√£o tamb√©m o n√∫mero de mortos por 100 mil habitantes do Peru: 112,3. O pa√≠s tem 35.923 √≥bitos pela Covid-19.

 A √çndia √© o terceiro pa√≠s, atr√°s apenas de EUA e Brasil, com maior n√∫mero de mortes pela Covid-19, com 137.139 √≥bitos. L√°, devido ao tamanho da popula√ß√£o, a taxa proporcional √© de 10,1 √≥bitos por 100 mil habitantes.

 Na Argentina, onde a pandemia desembarcou nove dias mais tarde que no Brasil e que seguiu uma quarentena r√≠gida de in√≠cio, o √≠ndice √© de 86,5 mortes por 100 mil habitantes (38.473 √≥bitos).

 J√° segundo o boletim do Minist√©rio da Sa√∫de desta segunda, o Brasil registrou 287 novas mortes em decorr√™ncia de infec√ß√£o pelo novo coronav√≠rus nas √∫ltimas 24 horas. O pa√≠s agora chega a um total de 173.120 √≥bitos desde o in√≠cio da pandemia.

 O boletim tamb√©m mostra que 21.138 pessoas foram infectadas no per√≠odo. O total de casos confirmados da Covid-19 agora chega a 6.335.878

 A iniciativa do cons√≥rcio de ve√≠culos de imprensa ocorre em resposta √†s atitudes do governo Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido), que amea√ßou sonegar dados, atrasou boletins sobre a doen√ßa e tirou informa√ß√µes do ar, com a interrup√ß√£o da divulga√ß√£o dos totais de casos e mortes. Al√©m disso, o governo divulgou dados conflitantes.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã",1606780980

I don't see how that is any sort of 'gotcha' in your favor. I, and the majority of polite society easily justify abortion. A fetus isn't a person. Full stop. 

I'm going to need to see some real, peer-reviewed studies on the mental effects that abortion has on women from legitimate scientific journals, not whatever hack pieces you can dredge up from the Christian Monitor or Breitbart.com.

Oh, what are these alternatives? Adoption? Tell that to the 108,000 children waiting to be adopted in the United States. Most of them will be in the system until they age out because no one wants to adopt anything but babies. Add to that fact that there is a concerted effort by the same people who are supposedly 'pro-life' (actually pro-birth) to prevent LGBTQ+ people from being able to adopt. These are the same people, and I'm going to assume based on your pro-life pamphlet talking points that you're one of them, that are against any form of legitimate sex ed in schools and think abstinence-only approaches work. All evidence points to the opposite conclusion btw: proper sex ed, not demonizing sex as sinful or dirty and getting rid of ab-only programs have been conclusively proven to vastly reduce the amount of abortions in the areas where they are introduced.

As for subsidized abortions, this article is a bit dated but is probably not too different than the current stats:

https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2015/10/02/are-american-taxpayers-paying-for-abortion/?sh=34e5a8ec6a4b

This shows that only about 6.6% of abortions are federally subsidized and then only in the case of harm to the mother as per the Hyde amendment. The rest of subsidized abortions are from state programs, which is a state's rights issue that I'm sure you're not going to argue against. 

Also, let's not forget that abortions have been on a steady decline for decades in the states and thats thanks to (glacially slow) revolution in how we as a society approach the topic of sex as we become less and less religious.",1606780980

Flipper was court-martialed and convicted in 1881, then dismissed from the Army.  It wasn't until 1976 when his family petitioned the Army to re-examine the case that they stated that they did not have the authority to overturn the court-martial conviction, and thus could not, however they did change his dismissal to a good conduct discharge.

He was then posthumously pardoned by Bill Clinton in 1999.

Nowhere in that entire story was he considered not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted in a court-martial.  It was simply shown in 1976 that his conviction and punishment were ""unduly harsh and unjust"" which changed the nature of his separation from the Army.  The pardon did not overturn the court-martial conviction, and therefore, he was still considered to be guilty of the crimes that he committed.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Israel is against thawing of relations between Iran and the west, especially the US. For example, they were against the nuclear accord which lifted sanctions in response to Iran shutting down it's nuclear program and opening the facilities to international inspectors. 

Most other countries want to move forward with the accord however it opens up Iran's economy which will provide much needed funds for the country and allow them to progress on the global stage. Israel would rather they remain isolated which keeps them at a disadvantage. 

Joe Biden will likely be much less partial to Israel than Trump, and may even attempt to revive the nuclear accord in some fashion. 

This means two things, if Israel wants to eliminate targets, they're better off doing it now where they'll face less blowback from the US government. Additionally, destabilising relations in the region will make it harder for countries like the US to resume thawing relations with Iran. In my opinion, they're poisoning the well before Biden gets into power to limit his options for improving relations with Iran.

It's speculative, but this in combination with the assassination of one of their top nuclear scientists last week (assumed to be an Israeli hit) makes me think they're trying to provoke Iran or at least worsen relations with the west. Worst case for them is it doesn't work, but they've still succeeded in killing important Iranians.",1606780981

&gt;For years, scientists have been struggling with the problem of ‚Äúprotein folding‚Äù ‚Äì mapping the three-dimensional shapes of the proteins that are responsible for diseases from cancer to Covid-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Google‚Äôs Deepmind claims to have created an artificially intelligent program called ‚ÄúAlphaFold‚Äù that is able to solve those problems in a matter of days.  
&gt;  
&gt;If it works, the solution has come ‚Äúdecades‚Äù before it was expected, according to experts, and could have transformative effects in the way diseases are treated.

Example in the Key of C.  


C C C C  


F F C C  


G G C C  


When playing over a given progression my instructors always had me use the Aeolian / natural minor positioned pentatonic. So the ""G"" form (CAGED) of the pentatonic would be at A given key of C.

&amp;#x200B;

So the pentatonic has 1 2 3 5 6 (C D E G A) and is missing the 4th tone F.

Using the Dorian, G form at D, pentatonic you get 1 2 4 5 6 (C D F G A) which has all the notes you need to do the progression. C F &amp; G

There's also the Phrygian  D E G A B, but that's missing the root. (2 3 5 6 7)  


I've asked a few blues players and they always don't have good answers. When asked to play over a progression, using a pentatonic scale just pick the modal form that has the notes in the progression you need or is there something else I'm missing here?",1606780982

"lowendgaming","t5_2u51f","Almost a year ago, I was given a Toshiba satellite A660. When I first tried to use it, It was pretty noticeable that it had issues. The hard drive was clicking, WIFI would sometimes turn off (and the multimedia keys were damaged so I couldn't turn it back on), closing the lid would actually force shut down the laptop somehow, and the fan would spin crazy. So I got a old hard drive off of a net book my parents used to use and installed it onto there, and I installed windows 10.

 When I opened up the laptop for the first time, I noticed that someone was already been in there since there was a stripped screw under the laptop. After opening it up, I noticed that the multimedia bar keys were damaged and that the connector was missing a tab. at that time I just left it there thinking that I didn't really need it, so I left it there. I closed it back up and then I turned it back on to see if it would run quiet but it was the same. After a few days, I went and got the same netbook that I stole a hard drive from and broke off the plastic tab that would hold the mouse connecter and repurposed it to use in the Multi keys. Turns out it work and I was surprised since 2 of the metal connectors on there were broken off. I was able to then turn on the WIFI and actually use it daily.

I was normally using it for classes and playing games, like Minecraft but would run hot. I then tried to put new thermal paste but the stripped screw wouldn't let me get access to it since it holds the DVD drive and I would have to take that out and then take out the board. So up to this day its my lil space heater lol. Anyways then I noticed that Epic games was giving out free games, so I took GTA V, rocket league, and civilization VI. I was able to get gta to run on low settings, though I was getting around 13-14 FPS. the other games wouldn't run  since it doesn't support DirectX 11 and above. So far I'm still using it, and the specs are:

* Core i7 740QM @ 1.73 GHz
* Nvidia GT 330 M, 1 Gig
* Western Digital 160 gig 5400 rpm hdd
* 8 gb ram

Its a nice laptop from the outside, but its really chugging with windows let alone with the hard drive. It would be nice to get a tower pc since I've seen that they can be easily upgraded unlike laptops. If I could win this PC, I would be pretty happy, but if not then I hope the best to that person :)

"dating","t5_2qhb1","&gt;Anyway if a guy who is much better looking with 10x the amount of matches , can't find success , it's evident that a probabilistic miracle would need to occur in my favor.

Bruh, (and this long after any newbie boost) in the last *24 hours* I've added 20 matches on bumble,  11 matches on Tinder, and 5 matches on Hinge.

Guess what?

This graphic says it all: [https://i.redd.it/ed9qczw387511.png](https://i.redd.it/ed9qczw387511.png) (not my data btw, but I think it captures the flow pretty well)

So, of my matches in the last day, .72 of them on average will end in a first date. Or rather, 50 matches per first meeting.

Of those first meetings, by the graph, 1 in 16 will end with a relationship (or relationship worthy) companion being found.

The lesson here is that you need matches just to even *play* the numbers game. The attrition rate is pretty high.

And really there's nothing you can do about it, I don't think.",1606780983

But I'm sure that their ideology of ""PVP"" (of which doesn't hardly exist anymore now that Survival has been gone), would be an equal playing field. Especially for Nuclear Winter.

Don't get me wrong, I give them credit where it's due. But it's a little baffling that they can't even consider a 60FPS option for current gen. I can't imagine them killing off last gen support anytime soon either just to appease the players on current gen (very weird to say LOL).",1606780983

There are many different medications and dosage combinations out there!

  Uni is incredibly hard when you're not medicated properly, it feels (and is, imo) damn near impossible.
  
  The university should have a dedicated team for students with disabilities, it's a total lifesaver to have someone in your corner who can help with negotiating extensions/adjustments. (I say should because I don't know how German universities work, I am in Australia)
  
  Most teachers (at least in my experience) will be great at accommodating you if he were to email them and say something like ""I'm a neurodivergent student and I'm struggling with X, what can we do?"" (obviously in more words haha). He doesn't need to disclose his precise condition if he doesn't feel comfortable with it. Neurodivergent covers a few conditions. 

  It's pretty easy to fall into a depression when it gets bad like this. Might be worth keeping an eye out for depression &amp; anxiety symptoms? They are both very common in people with ADD/ADHD.

Remember to have the attitude when dating that anyone should be lucky to be with you. You'll click with tons of different people. Wait for the relationship that's mind blowing, it'll come.

As for ghosting, I've learned that most ghosts turn into zombies so be prepared when this guy pops up from the dead. Take your power back and give him a Nah when he asks to see you again.

I got ghosted once. He popped up 6 months later. He then proceeded to chase me for next 8 months before I finally agreed to give him another shot. We're now in a relationship.

"BitcoinMarkets","t5_2wwh3","There are two different effects which make monetary inflation differ from CPI or other conventional measures. One is the growth of the total economy over time, as /u/malignantz pointed out below; if there are more goods and services available in the economy as a whole, then maintaining merely equal purchasing power would already require an expansion of the monetary base.

Another is the fact that not all monetary inflation is created equal. A lot of central bank money-printing comes through programs like quantitative easing, which largely amount to big games with financial markets designed to move bond prices and so on, and which in theory ends up with the extra dollars being held by banks and such (who aren't going out and spending them for goods) rather than going out into the ""real"" economy and pushing the prices of ordinary goods up. The degree to which this theory is true varies a lot -- pushing the prices of financial assets up does enrich people who hold lots of financial assets, and some of those people will take their profits and use them to buy real stuff (the Cantillon effect). But it is true that for equal monetary base inflation, something like QE will lead to less CPI inflation than something like the COVID stimulus earlier this year, where you just give the money out to individuals who tend to immediately spend it on goods.",1606780985

The sequence on how the war started is also interesting. He clearly stated that they had the idea 2 years prior and they was trying to fool the TPLF leaders. And he said that the ENDF was fighting with Eritrean military uniforms, which seems kinda sus to me.

 O ranking compara ETFs (sigla em ingl√™s para fundos negociados em Bolsa) que acompanham os principais √≠ndices acion√°rios de cada pa√≠s e s√£o negociados em Wall Street, em d√≥lares.

 Em primeiro lugar no ranking, est√° a Bolsa de Valores de Atenas, com alta de 32,8% em novembro. Dentre emergentes, o √≠ndice da Pol√¥nia lidera, com ganhos de 25,7% no m√™s e, em seguida, est√° a Turquia, com alta de 25,6%.

 A forte alta dos √≠ndices √© reflexo de um otimismo de investidores com os resultados de vacinas contra a [Covid-19](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/coronavirus/) e das elei√ß√µes americanas, que levaram a√ß√µes a se valorizarem e o d√≥lar, instrumento de seguran√ßa em momentos de incerteza, a perder for√ßa.

 O Ibovespa, principal √≠ndice acion√°rio do Brasil, subiu 15,9% em novembro, a maior valoriza√ß√£o mensal desde mar√ßo de 2016, qu[ando saltou 16,97% com a precifica√ß√£o do impeachment de Dilma Rousseff (PT)](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2016/03/1756052-bolsa-sobe-17-em-marco-maior-alta-mensal-em-13-anos-dolar-cai-10.shtml), que deixou o cargo de presidente em agosto daquele ano.

 Nesta segunda-feira (30), a [Moderna apontou efic√°cia de 94,1% em seu imunizante](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/11/moderna-entra-com-pedido-de-aprovacao-emergencial-para-vacina-contra-covid-nos-eua.shtml), entrando com pedido de aprova√ß√£o emergencial para vacina contra Covid nos EUA.

  No √∫ltimo dia 18, [a Pfizer, em parceria com a BioNTech, divulgou que a sua vacina √© segura e tem 95% de efic√°cia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/11/pfizer-anuncia-que-vacina-contra-a-covid-19-e-segura-e-atinge-95-de-eficacia.shtml). J√° a Universidade de Oxford (Reino Unido) em parceria com a farmac√™utica AstraZeneca disse, no √∫ltimo dia 23, que seu imunizante teria efic√°cia de at√© 90%.

 H√° ainda outras sete vacinas na corrida em √∫ltima fase de testes, com resultados para serem divulgados nos pr√≥ximos meses ou semanas.

 ‚ÄúO mercado come√ßou a colocar na conta a luz do fim do t√∫nel e acredita que as coisas voltem mais ou menos ao normal com a vacina, que tiveram resultados muito animadores. As pessoas ter√£o menos receio de ir para a rua‚Äù, diz Pedro Serra, gerente de an√°lise de empresas da Ativa Investimentos.

 Mesmo com uma segunda onda de coronav√≠rus levando a recordes de novos casos na Europa e nos EUA, investidores acreditam que a aprova√ß√£o emergencial da vacina pode estimular uma recupera√ß√£o mais robusta da economia, o que levaria a um aumento no lucro previsto das companhias.  
 Segundo Roberto Indech, estrategista-chefe da Clear, novembro teve a 11¬™ maior alta mensal do Ibovespa desde que o real foi implementado, em julho de 1994.

 ‚ÄúA alta em novembro √© o mercado precificando a expectativa de efic√°cia de vacinas e a sua produ√ß√£o de massa, bem como a elei√ß√£o americana‚Äù, diz Roberto Indech, estrategista-chefe da Clear.

 O mercado reagiu positivamente √† vit√≥ria do democrata Joe Biden nas elei√ß√µes presidenciais dos Estados Unidos, com uma maioria republicana no Senado, o que evita mudan√ßas dr√°sticas na condu√ß√£o da maior economia do mundo.

 Para seu governo, Biden escolheu a economista Janet Yellen, ex-presidente do Fed (banco central dos EUA) como secret√°ria do Tesouro. Segundo investidores, a dupla Yellen e Jerome Powell, atual presidente do Fed, poderia promover uma coordena√ß√£o entre as pol√≠ticas monet√°ria e fiscal a fim de garantir a recupera√ß√£o econ√¥mica dos EUA.

 ‚ÄúCom o cen√°rio de maior propens√£o ao risco e a Bolsa brasileira barata em d√≥lares frente seus pares, os investidores estrangeiros observaram uma boa janela de oportunidade de risco versus retorno e voltaram literalmente com tudo‚Äù, diz Indech.

 At√© o dia 26 de novembro, as compras de a√ß√µes por estrangeiros superaram as vendas em R$ 31,46 bilh√µes, segundo dados da B3. No ano, o saldo, sem levar em conta IPOs e follow-ons (ofertas iniciais e secund√°rias de a√ß√µes, respectivamente) ainda est√° negativo em R$ 53,42 bilh√µes, recorde da s√©rie hist√≥rica.

 O risco fiscal brasileiro, por√©m, pode levar a uma nova sa√≠da de estrangeiros, alertam analistas.

 Segundo Leonardo Peggau, superintendente de Renda Vari√°vel da Blue Trade, o fim do aux√≠lio emergencial, em 2020, defendido pelo minsitro Paulo Guedes (Economia), que impacta as contas p√∫blicas, tamb√©m depende das vacinas,que permitiriam uma maior abertura da economia. ""Guedes j√° disse que o aux√≠lio n√£o vai se prorrogar, ent√£o precisar√≠amos da vacina para ter a confian√ßa"".

 ‚ÄúDe qualquer forma isso [a entrada de estrangeiros em novembro] foi um marco em termos de fluxo, √© o maior desde 1995, e pode ser o pontap√© para um in√≠cio de 2021 melhor do que o visto em 2020‚Äù, afirma Indech, da Clear.

 Ele destaca como porta de entrada para o estrangeiro na Bolsa os setores financeiro e de commodities, destaques positivos no m√™s, por terem maior liquidez. Eles tamb√©m tem um peso maior na composi√ß√£o do Ibovespa, contribuindo para a alta do √≠ndice.

 Dentre os bancos, Santander teve o maior retorno, com 23,8% de alta. No √¢mbito das mat√©rias-primas, PetroRio saltou 58,9%, a segunda maior alta da Bolsa, perdendo apenas para Azul, que se valorizou 68,4%, com flexibiliza√ß√µes de viagens e expectativa de uma vacina em breve.

 Ap√≥s o melhor novembro desde 1999, o Ibovespa cedeu 1,52% no preg√£o desta segunda, a 108.893 pontos, com realiza√ß√£o de lucros.

 A maior alta da sess√£o foi do Carrefour, que subiu 3,6% ap√≥s cair 4,8% na semana passada com o assassinato de Jo√£o Alberto Silveira Freitas, homem negro de 40 anos conhecido como Beto Freitas, em um uma loja da varejista em Porto Alegre (RS).

 Na outra ponta do Ibovespa, varejistas com forte atua√ß√£o no ecommerce recuaram ap√≥s a Black Friday e depois de altas expressivas desde o come√ßo da pandemia, com a disparada das vendas online na esteira de medidas de restri√ß√µes para tentar controlar a dissemina√ß√£o da doen√ßa.

 Nesta sess√£o, B2W caiu 8%, acumulando decl√≠nio de 6,4% em novembro.

 Em Wall Street, S&amp;P 500 caiu 0,46% e Dow Jones, 0,91%. Nasdaq teve leve queda de 0,06%.

 Apesar da baixa no preg√£o, o S&amp;P 500 teve o seu melhor novembro de todos os tempos, com alta de 10,75%, sendo o maior ganho desde abril. J√° o Dow Jones teve o maior ganho mensal desde 1987, saltando 11,8%, ganho semelhante ao Nasdaq em novembro, que tamb√©m teve o melhor desempenho mensal desde abril.

 No exterior, o cen√°rio foi semelhante. O MSCI global, que re√∫ne a√ß√µes de economias desenvolvidas desde 1970, subiu 13,46% em novembro, sua melhor performance da hist√≥ria.

 A Bolsa de Londres teve seu melhor m√™s desde 1989, com ganhos de 12,35%, e o Stoxx 600, √≠ndice que re√∫ne as maiores empresas da Europa desde 1986, teve alta recorde de 13,73%.

 A Bolsa da Fran√ßa disparou 20% neste m√™s, enquanto a da Espanha e a da It√°lia, subiram mais de 22% cada. As a√ß√µes alem√£s ganharam mais de 12%.

 O petr√≥leo subiu 24,3% no m√™s, com o barril de Brent (refer√™ncia internacional) a US$ 47,73, o maior patamar desde mar√ßo, antes da OMS (Organiza√ß√£o Mundial da Sa√∫de) declarar pandemia de coronav√≠rus.

 J√° o real teve seu melhor m√™s de novembro j√° registrado, segundo a sexta moeda que mais se valorizou no mundo no per√≠odo, marcado pelo enfraquecimento da moeda americana. Dentre emergentes, foi a segunda atr√°s apenas do peso colombiano.

 O d√≥lar recuou 6,8% ante o real no per√≠odo, a R$ 5,3480. O turismo est√° a R$ 5,503.

 Esta √© a maior queda mensal do c√¢mbio desde outubro de 2018, quando Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido) ganhou as elei√ß√µes presidenciais, levando o d√≥lar a cair 8,5%.

 No ano, por√©m, a divisa americana acumula um salto de 33,2% ante a brasileira.

 Nesta sess√£o, o d√≥lar subiu 0,4%, em dia de corre√ß√£o global para a moeda.",1606780985

It's actually a close tie between Treecko and Torchic but Blaziken is where Torchic really shines while Treecko and Grovyle are two of my favorites.

Snivy I'm not that thrilled with and one of my few complaints about Gen 5 is the weak starters, to the point I boxed mine in favor of other pokemon.

I don't have a thing against fire pokemon but the fire/fighting type got *old* after Blaziken and just made me want to use Blaziken instead, I don't care for pigs or monkeys so there goes Chimchar, Tepig, and Grookey.

&gt;The proposal was struck down by a vote of 65 to 33.
Prior to that, Biden supported a 7% increase in monthly Social Security benefits in 1973, and in 1995, he supported an amendment to prevent Social Security cuts from being in any balanced budget legislation.

"TheSilphRoad","t5_3c2d7","This is revisionist, and if you consider all the factors Australian players did not get ahead overall with coins at all.

You're forgetting that for a large portion of the time Australia had these bonus coins, it was only for 5 coins and frequently included Win a Raid as a task. Additionally, for a big portion of that we also had extremely nerfed coin rates from gyms. To get your 55 coins a day, you'd need 25 hours (yes, 25...) of pokemon gym time per day AND do tasks that quite frequently included Win a Raid. That was a huge nerf compared to 50 coins in 8.33 hours of gym time that the rest of the world continued to have.

If anything, the last bits where it was moved to 20 coins for bonus tasks and 30 coins for normal gym defending only made up for the lost coins during that disaster time.

People be like ""oh well, you gotta _ask_ for help and gotta _talk_ about your problems in therapy but when I manage to talk about my most difficult issues I feel like they're not taking me seriously and don't do anything with it. It's so shallow and so far away from everything and afterwards it's like they just blame you for not trying hard enough. Trying something that doesn't even really help.

I get he wants his guys to line up, and start making their reads but someone like Godwin if nothing else can totally mess up a defenses run fits using motion at the snap because he's such a good blocker anyways. 

For how exotic Bowles runs his Defenses you'd think Arians and Leftwich would at least try to match that offensively but nah. Just line it up and run it. That can work, sure, but why you are not taking advantage of every exploit you can and all the players talents is beyond me.

"PersonalFinanceCanada","t5_2tasy","My left-leaning politics conflict with my being a small landlord of a 3/2 2-unit house, only, my mortgage costs a bunch more and my rent income is a lot less than the example. Still, I am net cashflow positive according to any given month spreadsheet.

The problem with the idea of being cashflow neutral is that it must still account for all replacements costs and maintenance costs and don't know when that will come up. I'm sure you'd be quick to agree that if a stove or toilet suddenly broken the landlord was a moral and legal duty to replace it immediately. That means someone would have to be cashflow positive month to month so that big items can be repaired and replaced, and aim for cash-flow neutral over long time periods. 

In the example I made up above, they are not thousands in equity per month, only $400-$500. That's still significant but they are taking on a lot of risk for that equity, because housing is not guaranteed to appreciate. Over the past 10 years with our rental, we have barely kept with inflation in terms of appraised price (recently had it professionally done).

Finally, I've said this elsewhere but there is another major influence on this that we need to call out, and that's the big banks. The small landlord is raising equity off of the rent it's true, but is also taking on risks and obligations of house costs. On the other side is a mortgage that is simply taking equal value directly as interest... only they have basically no risk because they can take the whole home should there be default on their interest. Prime is not their base cost - it is mostly straight profit going to shareholders.",1606780990
"WGU","t5_2se63","Hmm everything you've been saying is basically the opposite of what I see in older posts. 

The WGU exam was exactly what you just described - ultra convoluted and the worst course I've ever taken. Seems that others who'd posted about it said that the ISC(2) exam was far more straightforward and overall easier covering the same topics.

Since SSCP is the my only ISC(2) exam experience, I can definitely confirm that it was very easy to understand - compared to this WGU cloud security course.

Anywho, I appreciate your trying to help but since you haven't taken the course yet (or CCSP either?) it's difficult to assign value to what you're telling me since you don't know yourself what the WGU course covers or how its test is.

I'm hoping that people who have taken this course and the CCSP exam somewhat recently will be able to chime in to confirm if it is still 'easier' than the WGU test or not so that I know if I should just go ahead with CCSP this week or if I need to find extra material to brush up with.",1606780990

Eventually you need legendary+ fodder units to ascend your heroes higher, so it's good in the early game to just bring fodder tier heroes to legendary+.

That being said, you should wait until you have more fodder units and ascend your Mirael to L+

Lets reduce your argument and mine to their fundamentals. Seeing as you replied to my comment initially I think I need to remind you that the tangent from the initial comment I brought up, or it's thesis is the only thing that should be in the limits of the discussion. If you have your own comment to add to the \*larger\* discussion then it should have it's own comment.

I brought up that the Conservatives know the consequences of their actions, but are being willfully negligent. I said that they are cynical to the point of self destruction. That has nothing to do with literally any high minded political theory you ascribe them. It doesn't matter. It is irrelevant. It doesn't matter that there are an increasingly small minority that explicitly or implicitly take in rugged individual Austrian school bullshit. They can believe in the tooth fairy what what it matters. That is irrelevant to my point.

What they \*say\* they are about and what they actually are about has nothing to do with attribution error. It has nothing to do with cause and effect of their misguided policies. We are not clever for finding the hypocrisy there.

They are 100% about ""Fuck em"" but in very different terms. It isn't about them valuing autonomy or the individual. It my well be reactionary contrarian rhetoric that they then couch in that shit, but that is fallacious.

Trumpistan is overwhelmingly those people. Those that value liberty as a concept have no problem with the police state as an exception. The hypocrisy of ""pro life"" is just as easy an example. These people hold no philosophy with any kind of sincerity. The views you believe they have implicitly or explicitly are a crock of shit if they toss it over if it conflicts with ""Fuck 'em"" selfishness.

If your argument is Haidt agrees with  ""Fuck 'em"" as the thrust of classical conservatism. Then we are in accord. Since you need to be ""right"" so bad. Let that be the hill to die on.  


If you want to isolate what I am saying it's that fascism by any means possible is the goal. ""Fuck 'em"" is it reduced to the abstract totality. They don't care about democracy or merit thus any political theory that has it as a tenet is superfluous. They don't embrace competition. They embrace dominance. They don't embrace liberty they embrace totalitarianism.  


I hear what you are saying and I disagree with what you are saying. I disagree to the point where I doubt we can find common ground or compromise. That is why i keep repeating the same thing. These people are not high minded idealists for ANYTHING. Not implicitly or explicitly. Certainly not with any sincere conviction. The minute they voted for Trump even when he shit all over those values, the whole theory changed.  


They have more in common with brown shirts or black shirts than Regan Republicans. So you can't paint them with the same brush.",1606780991

The overwhelming majority of God's creation doesn't need to worry about evil.  Rocks sit there being rocks.  Stars be stars.  Plants be plants.  Bugs be bugs.  That's all that's expected of them.  And they're each beautiful and wonderful in their own way... but they're fundamentally limited.  They're not very much like God.

Our role, as actual God-breathed children of the Most High, is ultimately much more glorious and wonderful... and much harder.  Because we have to live through this awful struggle against evil, external and internal, to really grow into our role as children of God.  He makes his rain to shine on the just and the unjust, he blessed those who cursed him, and if there's no injustice and no cursing, we can't ever be like him.

HIV kills virtually no one at onset of initial infection It usually takes more than a year for patients to exhibit sights of severe impairment.

By contrast, Covid kills nearly 5% of patients within the two weeks and roughly 20% of survivors show some significant form of impairment within a few weeks.  

HIV lifespans with treatment are generally regarded as approaching normal, with studies estimating life expectancy between ten years less than HIV- people to a few months more in exceptional circumstances.  I wonder what a Covid survivors‚Äô life expectancy might be after kidney or liver failure?  Life expectancy with dialysis is about a decade...

The only thing that‚Äôs ‚ÄúPanic Porn‚Äù is you trying to convince a bunch of PLHIV that HIV must be worse ‚Äúbecause it affects the immune system‚Äù, when all signs point to Covid actually being worse.  If anything, our inability to consider the severity of Covid vs other diseases speaks to society‚Äôs fundamental inability to separate the danger of modern diseases from how they‚Äôre transmitted and who they affect.  Its really hard to see where society‚Äôs shittiness towards PLHIV ends and where it‚Äôs denial about Covid begins here.

&gt;I almost think you're deliberately misunderstanding my point

This happens when you have to be dishonesty vague about your points. I have actually asked you multiple times to demonstrate your argument and everytime you fail to do so.

&gt;Please tell me you understand the concept of a megaphone. Ad space amplifies your speech thus theoretically more people would hear it, it doesn't mean the speech of others is limited in any way, its just a means of making more people hear it. 


Yeah a megaphone literally makes you louder. What don't you understand about that fact? If more people can hear you, your speech is greater than someone who reaches less people...no one needs to have their speech reduced for them to have less speech than another.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","Dump her, she is using you as a doormat and he is not your friend, he's the man who is fucking your wife. Also any time a woman spontaneously and unilaterally asks for an open relationship, she either has someone in mind that she wants to bang, or has already cheated and is looking to legitimize he behavior and protect her reputation. I also want to emphasize that even if you were ok with an open relationship, this stopped being that the second she violated your one boundary and started sleeping with the one man she told you was off limits. At this point, she is just cheating on you at this point and you are allowing it to happen, you also make it sound like she has a drinking problem which begs the question, ""in a world filled with women who are faithful and loving and also not alcoholics, WHY ARE YOU STAYING WITH THIS PERSON?"" In 60 or 70 years you will be dead with certainty, and you could get hit by a bus tomorrow. Your time is more valuable then anything else you possess, because you'll never get it back once it's spent, you can never make more, and you don't know how much more life will give you. Right now, you are taking your most precious commodity and lighting it on fire every second you spend contemplating staying with this garbage human. You will never be able to trust this woman not to leave you or betray your trust again, even if she does decide to come back to you after she gets bored with this guy. How are you supposed to start a family with someone like that, where you could at the drop of a hat come home to an empty house and wind up having to pay child support to her while you get weekend visits, not to mention being forced to explain to your kids why mommy loves pino noir more then them? Let your absolute asshat of a former friend deal with her crap, his future will be his punishment, and have her served with divorce papers while she's with him and cut contact. You can arrange things so the divorce is handled through your lawyer and you won't have to speak with her again, and blocking her on everything will keep her from trying to manipulate you into taking you back . She will destroy every last shred of your self respect if you let her, and you are worth so much more than that OP.

Edit: forgot to add that once this trainwreck of a STBXW is yeeted into the sun you should definitely see a therapist for your inability to stand up for yourself, say ""no"", and enforce reasonable boundaries.

You may go OOBE and ""meet"" someone who has passed, but it's most likely not actual their soul you are encountering. It is a simulation of them. When people pass on, they dont stick around. Their ""soul"" goes through a process to get ready for another incarnation in another life.

Life is objectively self defeating.. 

We're dealing with absolute logic and truth. Any form of anything that:

1. Opens the potential for real harm,
2. especially to serve a need,
3. or fix a problem,
4. that the system(s) themselves are responsible for creating by merely existing, 

is when innocuous error turns into catastrophic error. Because all types of sentience are catastrophically volatile and self-defeating by fact of their own existence... since even needing or wanting pleasure is a problem, not a benefit or solution. So a system that generates pure ecstasy is equally pointless and unsound. Especially because such a system could not be guaranteed failsafe (hint: turned into a much different system later, that produced a much different type of feeling, for an extremely long time).  

Correct, feeding the poor may only serve to protract the suffering many times over because the poor have universally and historically been the least cautious or most reckless when it comes to procreation. Therefore, it would be better if we simply let the poor die. But it‚Äôd be best if we simply held charity hostage, until there is assurance that they won‚Äôt breed. Such as getting sterilization. Which should be offered as cheaply or freely as possible. But typically, it would just be seen as a form of eugenics.",1606780993

My understanding is that AliExpress Standard Shipping is a shipping company / service.

They use intermediaries to handle the parcels.

Sellers do not get to choose whether it is PostNL, SingPost, Asendia or Cainiao.

In many cases, depending on the seller of course, they (or a supplier/warehouse) create a shipping request, print and put the label on the package, and hand it to be picked-up by the actual carrier and shipped out.

If seller processed your order quickly (i.e., created the label and handed out your package ASAP) I think they've done a good job and deserve the stars.

Now shipping times vary depending on many reasons and trust me, seller wants you to get your package as quickly as possible so (in many cases) you can click ""received"" and they can have their funds released by AE.

Hope that helps",1606780994

"BackYardChickens","t5_2sdri","I posted this spring asking for advice about him, but unfortunately our little guy passed Thanksgiving morning.  The hen whose face is hidden as has cross beak but has faired much better so far and grown at a normal pace.  Hoping she continues to thrive.  I have specifically used deep feeders and waters that allow them to eat easier as recommended on this sub previously. 

He was my little lunchtime buddy.  I would go visit him on my lunch break for some time with chick food hoping to get him to gain weight without much luck.  He was the same age as his siblings pictured but never grew much bigger than a chick.  He would excitedly meet me every day and loved hanging out in his special time.  When he was in the run, all the other chickens watched out for him and let him cuddle and hide under their feed whenever he wanted.  I will sure miss him and I think the rest of the flock does too.

&gt; Seth, by contrast, is always dominant while he's available, so he would never drop.

This is incorrect - Seth would drop below Orson, who has just 1 chapter of availability, but he outperforms Seth if averaging their performance over their total availability. The conclusion of this tier list would be that Orson is the best character in FE8, not Seth.",1606780995

"RWBY","t5_2vhg0","Okay, so let‚Äôs get this out of the way: 

Weiss was screwed fighting Vernal and summoning was the only option she saw.

She doesn‚Äôt only use her summoning in the fight, as the first thing we see of the engagement is her engaging Vernal in melee. Then, we see that Weiss has been forced back and is clearly losing. Vernal is fast and powerful (with an overpowered laser), and Weiss thinks she is the maiden on top of that. The only option she has really to maybe win is her most powerful ability in summoning. It‚Äôs not like she could hit Vernal with a range attack and she already tried melee.

It‚Äôs badly choreographed, as all those fight in that room were, but I think what happened is more than just ‚ÄúWeiss relying too much on summoning‚Äù.

The only thing that maybe could have helped would be time dilation. But we don‚Äôt know how that works really, and it sure as hell didn‚Äôt help her last time. IMO the only way her loss to Banesaw even makes sense is the theory that time catches up to the user, slowing them down after, though this might not be true. It‚Äôs honestly the most boring thing in her arsenal though 

While I would like Weiss to use some of her abilities more, I don‚Äôt see it as as much of a issue as you seem to. Often summoning is absolutely the best option in the circumstance she is in. Her knight for example is extremely powerful, ranged, and keeps the enemies away from her. She has used her ranged glyphs to shoot plenty of thing and has been shown using her movement based glyphs a bunch.

I think that the fight against Marrow, where she uses pretty much her entire arsenal, is something that can be the hope for the future of Weiss‚Äôs fights. That she uses it all together.

Though I‚Äôm personally hoping for fending from her the most.",1606780997

 O relato √© do youtuber ga√∫cho Thomas Castro, 42, tamb√©m conhecido como Thomas Uber. Ele tem 301 mil inscritos em seu canal. Sua empreitada no mercado financeiro, que se iniciou em 2008 com a [crise do subprime](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/03/crise-ate-parece-mas-e-muito-diferente-da-grande-recessao.shtml), e sua popularidade nas redes o levou a desenvolver cursos para ensinar estrat√©gias de como operar na Bolsa.

 √Ä reportagem Castro afirma que s√≥ neste m√™s acumulou um ganho de R$ 127 mil na Bolsa com o que aprendeu na pr√°tica, com ganhos e perdas nas opera√ß√µes. O ga√∫cho [n√£o tem forma√ß√£o em economia](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/11/cvm-alerta-sobre-atuacao-de-influenciadores-na-recomendacao-de-investimentos.shtml) ou √°rea correlata e tamb√©m n√£o possui certificado para atuar como corretor.

 Assim como ele, a internet est√° repleta de gurus cobrando por dicas de opera√ß√£o na Bolsa, muitos sem forma√ß√£o ou certifica√ß√£o.

 ‚ÄúNa verdade, meus cursos n√£o s√£o feitos para eu ser uma bab√° e ficar cuidando das pessoas, indicando o que comprar ou n√£o, eu apenas mostro o que eu venho fazendo e tem dado certo pra mim‚Äù, diz.

 Foi assistindo aos v√≠deos do ex-parceiro de profiss√£o que o motorista de aplicativo M√°rcio da Concei√ß√£o, 41, resolveu abrir uma conta numa corretora com R$ 100 para entender a din√¢mica do mercado.

  ‚ÄúEstou aprendendo ainda. No come√ßo, voc√™ mais perde do que ganha. Mas estou me dedicando. Tem uma menina de 16 anos que est√° tirando R$ 300 por dia com day trade‚Äù, diz o paulista que acabou de vender seu carro, um modelo sofisticado, em troca de d√≠vidas quitadas e um autom√≥vel popular.

 [Day ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/por-que-economes-em-bom-portugues/2020/09/a-pandemia-do-day-trade.shtml)[trade](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/por-que-economes-em-bom-portugues/2020/09/a-pandemia-do-day-trade.shtml) √© a compra e venda de um ativo no mesmo preg√£o. Em muitos produtos, como minicontratos, esta negocia√ß√£o pode ser feita a descoberto, ou seja, sem o dinheiro para se adquirir o ativo em conta.

 Opera√ß√µes que se tornaram populares nos cursos s√£o de mini d√≥lar e mini √≠ndice ‚Äîminicontratos futuros, no qual se aposta em um valor de compra ou venda do ativo que ser√£o celebrados em uma data futura.

 ‚ÄúTem que ter disciplina e n√£o pode ser ganancioso‚Äù, afirma M√°rcio da Concei√ß√£o, referindo-se aos ensinamentos de Suriel Ports, outro youtuber famoso que tamb√©m tem cursos pr√≥prios de opera√ß√£o na Bolsa.

 A p√°gina do Ports Trader no Youtube tem 1,09 milh√£o de inscritos e √© apresentada por Suriel, que se autointitula como o maior canal de day trade do mundo.

 A **Folha **tentou entrar em contato com Suriel, mas n√£o obteve retorno at√© o fechamento desta reportagem. Assim como os v√≠deos do Thomas Uber, em que ele aparece operando na churrascaria e caminhando em uma praia, o canal Ports Trader vincula o enriquecimento na Bolsa a uma vida de conforto e consumo. Nos v√≠deos, Suriel aparece caminhando entre lojas de marca, como Louis Vuitton, fazendo compras em loja de t√™nis ou mesmo sendo servido por um gar√ßom.

 √â tamb√©m Suriel que entrevista uma garota de 16 anos que, ainda no Ensino M√©dio, aprendeu a investir durante a pandemia e conta que, no primeiro dia, lucrou R$ 1.000 no mercado financeiro.

 De acordo com levantamento do Google, no acumulado de 2020 (at√© o dia 27 de novembro) ante o mesmo per√≠odo do ano passado, a busca ‚Äúcomo fazer day trade‚Äù subiu 93%. O estado em que essa pergunta mais cresceu foi S√£o Paulo, onde as buscas subiram 145% neste ano com rela√ß√£o a 2019.

 ‚ÄúA facilidade de se produzir cursos online e a pandemia facilitaram isso e o aumento no n√∫mero de investidores da Bolsa fez pessoas quererem entender [o mercado]‚Äù, diz Leonardo Dirickson, diretor de produtos da casa de an√°lises financeiras Suno Research.

 Ao fim de outubro deste ano, eram 3,1 milh√µes de CPF na Bolsa brasileira, quase o dobro do 1,68 milh√£o em 2019.

 Segundo Dirickson, as plataformas de comercializa√ß√£o de conte√∫do Hotmart, Eduzz ou Monetizze facilitaram a disponibiliza√ß√£o de cursos. A pr√≥pria Suno usa a Hotmart para oferecer e monetizar seus quatro cursos sobre investimento em a√ß√µes.

 Ele tamb√©m conta que a procura por cursos aumenta [se a Bolsa tem valoriza√ß√µes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/11/bolsa-supera-106-mil-pontos-pela-primeira-vez-desde-marco.shtml) ou quedas muito expressivas, algo presente neste ano, com grande volatilidade dos ativos devido √† crise em decorr√™ncia da pandemia.

 Em [junho deste ano](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/06/xp-lanca-projeto-de-educacao-financeira-e-ve-juros-baixos-por-muito-tempo.shtml), a XP lan√ßou a XPeed, empresa voltada a educa√ß√£o financeira, que re√∫ne cursos e MBAs que o grupo oferece.

 ‚ÄúH√° um aumento na procura e entramos no cen√°rio de procura por qualidade‚Äù, diz Isabella Mattar, presidente da XPeed. Ela afirma que a participa√ß√£o da empresa na receita do grupo ainda √© t√≠mida, mas que a ‚Äúeduca√ß√£o √© importante como um neg√≥cio complementar‚Äù.

 Segundo Isabella, o perfil dos alunos √© muito distinto. H√° [desde os que est√£o come√ßando](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/11/baixa-renda-entra-na-mira-de-corretoras-e-influenciadores-digitais.shtml) at√© os que querem se profissionalizar.

 ‚ÄúAs pessoas faziam aula de trading e achavam que j√° entendiam de finan√ßas. N√£o adianta o brasileiro migrar para a Bolsa sem o conhecimento. E muitos fazem isso. √â muito perigoso, se pode perder muito dinheiro.‚Äù

 S√≥cio da EQI Investimentos, Fernando Pereira avalia positivamente o curso do influencer Tio Huli, investidor profissional com certificado pela Apimec, associa√ß√£o dos analistas e profissionais do mercado, de cerca de R$ 1.000.

 ‚ÄúAqui no Brasil, quando estudava e queria me profissionalizar n√£o tinha muita coisa acad√™mica. Fiz o curso do Tio Huli de an√°lise de empresa e mercado de op√ß√µes‚Äù, diz. Depois, para se profissionalizar, fez o curso de certifica√ß√£o da Ancord e hoje √© aluno do MBA da XP.

 ‚ÄúQuanto mais informa√ß√£o, melhor. A pessoa vai ter mais capacidade de discernir sobre a qualidade do conte√∫do‚Äù, diz Eduardo Forestieri, coordenador da comiss√£o de educa√ß√£o da Planejar.

 Ele indica que os investidores primeiro busquem informa√ß√µes e conte√∫dos em fontes oficiais, como CVM, Anbima, Banco Central e demais portais do governo dedicados √† educa√ß√£o financeira.

 Forestieri tamb√©m recomenda que o investidor veja se os professores t√™m licen√ßas como o CPA-10, CPA-20 ou CEA concedidos pela Anbima, e, no caso de planejamento financeiro, uma certifica√ß√£o como o CFP (Certified Financial Planner), concedido pela Planejar.

 ‚ÄúAs pessoas t√™m que buscar professores com qualifica√ß√£o o suficiente, semelhante a uma escolha de faculdade. √â melhor a institui√ß√£o renomada que o conhecido que ganhou em uma ou outra opera√ß√£o, que pode ter sido sorte ou informa√ß√£o interna‚Äù, diz Dirickson, da Suno.

 Para Isabella, da XPeed, a experi√™ncia pr√°tica do professor deve ser considerada, bem como uma institui√ß√£o por tr√°s do curso ofertado e um certificado ao fim. ‚Äú√â importante os alunos terem crivo de qualidade. Tem muita gente que n√£o √© certificada, que n√£o estudou, dando aula sobre o tema‚Äù.

 A Abradin (Associa√ß√£o Brasileira de Investidores) tem recebido reclama√ß√µes de pequenos investidores que perderam dinheiro ao operar no day trade, conta Aur√©lio Valporto, presidente da associa√ß√£o.

 ‚ÄúMuitos novos e ing√™nuos investidores caem no conto do ganho r√°pido e f√°cil, muitas vezes por desespero de quem perdeu emprego. Day trade √© como cassino, √© preciso advertir [contra]. √â perigoso, se perde [dinheiro]. N√£o conheci ningu√©m que ficou rico com day trade. √â algo que vicia porque joga uma grande carga de adrenalina nas pessoas.‚Äù

 Valporto se diz preocupado com os cursos de day trade, que classifica como desservi√ßo. Ele aponta que falta regula√ß√£o na √°rea.

 ‚ÄúPermitir day trade apenas para investidores qualificados e institucionais seria uma boa sa√≠da. A CVM tamb√©m deveria proibir curso de day trade‚Äù.

 A CVM √© respons√°vel por regular o mercado, mas n√£o os cursos sobre o tema. Por meio de sua assessoria de imprensa, a autarquia diz que tem recebido consultas e den√∫ncias acerca de atividades educacionais de[ recomenda√ß√µes de investimento](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/painelsa/2020/11/apos-cerco-da-cvm-a-influenciadores-digitais-empiricus-da-bolsa-de-estudo.shtml).

 ‚ÄúEm alguns casos, h√° a transmiss√£o ao vivo em salas de conversa online, o acompanhamento de opera√ß√µes no preg√£o, com coment√°rios e sugest√µes. Se essa atividade √© desempenhada de forma profissional, havendo benef√≠cio, vantagem ou remunera√ß√£o por conta dessa recomenda√ß√£o, mesmo que por meio de taxas de assinatura ou receitas indiretas, pode restar caracterizado o exerc√≠cio de atividade de analista de valores mobili√°rios, o que requer autoriza√ß√£o.‚Äù

 A CVM recomenda, antes de qualquer investimento, que o interessado em operar verifique se o ofertante possui registro na autarquia para atuar no mercado ‚Äúe que n√£o acredite promessas de retornos elevados, r√°pidos e com baixo risco, caracter√≠sticas comuns em esquemas irregulares‚Äù.

the comic is still cool though. one of the best parts of it is seeing anakin between TPM and AOTC, a fairly unexplored period of the timeline. i think the only other time we‚Äôve seen anakin in this time as an adolescent padawan was the ‚Äúchoose your destiny‚Äù book about him and kenobi.

"ProgrammerHumor","t5_2tex6","Not exactly, because `&lt;script&gt;` embeds JavaScript into HTML and then it's interpreted by the engine, while doing it in Bash is different because Bash can't interpret the language, it sends it as an argument to another program (the interpreter or compiler) for that program to parse and execute the code.

`&lt;script&gt;` doesn't make HTML a programming language either, but too many people get very toxic when someone says that they develop or program in HTML (which is not wrong to say) because HTML can't make a full Turing machine, and it's very absurd because when you work with HTML you are programming, you are developing, you are not telling the computer how to work exactly, but you are doing technical work which fits very well with what programming is, we are not talking about creating a document of LO Writer / MS Word, but to create something in a more technical and methodical way.

The joke that HTML is not a programming language is very toxic because it's used to attack developers who are starting, or even already have a good experience, there have been several memes on this subreddit about that, it's best to stop that joke already, which is also very boring and annoying.",1606781000

OP's dad gave his life to his wife, and she threw it away. While she was living the best life she could for herself, she caused him to waste his. All that time spent with her, all those memories he shared with someone he thought loved him, all of that was rendered worthless by his wife's affair.

Regulus had Kreacher take him to the cavern where Voldemort's horcrux locket was protected by the basin of poisoned drink.  He gave Kreacher the replacement locket and told him to switch the lockets, then take the horcrux back to Grimmauld Place and destroy it.  After Regulus drank the poisoned potion, he was dragged underwater and drowned by the inferi in the lake.

Kreacher was unable to destroy the locket.

Regulus had told Kreacher never to reveal to his mistress what had happened.  Sirius assumed Voldemort had killed his brother.

If either his mother or Sirius had ever commanded Kreacher to reveal what had happened, he would have been compelled to tell.  But they did not.

It was only when Harry, his new master, said ""Kreacher, sit up and tell me everything you know about that locket, and everything Regulus had to do with it!"" that Kreacher revealed the truth.",1606781002

You should be very active in the shooters box moving left and right with the pigeons- and don‚Äôt stop moving when you pull the trigger, keep the gun moving through the trigger pull and follow through with you motion after firing. 

A good way to gauge if you are doing a good enough job moving with the clays is to compare how fast the clays look like they‚Äôre flying when you‚Äôre shooting to how fast they seem to be flying while your watching someone else shoot. For most people the clays look like they‚Äôre going 100mph when they‚Äôre shooting, but when they watch everyone else shoot the clays are moving nice and slow. 

Trying to watch an object fly by while starting down a 28‚Äù barrel takes getting used to. Your head and eyes naturally match the speed of moving objects as they pass by, but your eyes can‚Äôt do that because their looking down the barrel and not at the clay. The solution is to move the barrel with the clays which will in turn allow your eyes to match the speed of the clays and it‚Äôll make your life 10x easier.",1606781002

Generally we try very hard to make medical conditions not a condition for hiring. [in the USA, things like the the Americans with Disabilities Act make it illegal to discriminate in employment based on disability](https://www.justia.com/employment/employment-discrimination/medical-condition-discrimination/). And [asking prospective hires to divulge medical details is very clearly illegal](https://www.eeoc.gov/pre-employment-inquiries-and-medical-questions-examinations), or at the very least, puts you in a risky legal position.

Let's talk about why that's a good thing. If you have a health issue like diabetes, we don't want companies to refuse to hire you because they'd have to pay for your medical insurance. If you have a medical condition, you shouldn't have to disclose it to every company you apply to, because you have a right to privacy about your health. Likewise, asking trans people to prove that they're ""stable"" requires them to divulge private medical information and opens the door to medical discrimination for economic incentives or due to bigotry.

There are places where one might say that being ""unstable"" might reduce the ability to do the essential work of the job. For instance, professional scuba divers have requirements about ""fitness to dive"" which limit employment in commercial diving to those without a number of medical conditions. This is because having those medical conditions could prevent a diver from performing their essential functions safely.

tl;dr: this violates medical privacy and anti-discrimination laws and isn't a great plan.",1606781002

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Avoid any sort of sexual or romantic relationship with anyone in their twenties or older. Older adults are supposed to mentor and guide you, not take advantage of you. And seriously, for most adults, a switch flips sometime in our early to mid-20s in which teenagers just lose any sort of attraction for us. And that feeling only intensifies as we get older. Someone looking at a teenager and seeing a romantic prospect has something seriously borked going on upstairs. 

If you do decide to pursue such a relationship, protect yourself. Take charge of your own fertility, no matter what sort of birth control they say they're on. Don't exchange nudes until you're 18. Remember that someone who truly cares for you also cares for your boundaries.

Avoid anyone in your age group who doesn't see a future for themselves. Hang out with people who have plans for their lives. They don't need a ten-point five-year plan, dreams about what kind of house they're gonna own is enough. People who don't see a future for themselves are likely to make bad decisions based on what they want in the moment, which can lead them to spiral into drug addiction, crime, bad credit, etc. And they might bring you down with them. Whereas spending time with people who are excited about their future will also help you get excited about your own future. 

And seriously, avoid beer and weed. Your brain is still forming, and evidence suggests alcohol and weed may impair that formation. There will be more than enough time to get wasted in your 20s and beyond. If you do indulge, make it a rare thing - certainly not daily or even weekly.",1606781003

It is called data oriented design. It emphasizes on structuring your program around data layout in memory and in Caches. Obviously it means you need to have a solid grasp of how Modern processors work and tradeoffs between various access cycles. Unfortunately it is not easy as everyone out there stresses on one form of programming or another ( object oriented, functional, procedural , event driven etc etc ).

None of these fit modern processor hierarchy of access speeds. The amount of time a CPU just does nothing while running a program is insane, especially waiting for IO to complete( memory, disk and network IO).

Here is a simple example, everyone uses linked lists at some point or other but a vector or a simple array is insanely fast( sometimes 1000x times faster) if you structure your data cleverly. But it takes time and resources, which companies don't have.",1606781003

Okay hold on a second guys. Look, before we get too deep into it I just want to take a sec to send a huge thank you to the beautiful people over at RAID SHADOW LEGENDS for sponsoring this video. Now you guys know I don‚Äôt usually take on sponsors, but I‚Äôve been hearing a lot about this game recently, so I decided to throw some hours at it and give it a try, and I gotta say I‚Äôm really liking it so far. For those who don‚Äôt know RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is a free-to-play turn-based RPG that‚Äôs got like 15-million downloads over the last few months. Google Play even nominated it for an award for being one of its top RPG‚Äôs. It‚Äôs got a really cool story campaign, active PVP arenas, dungeons, 16 different factions, and hundreds and hundreds of heroes to collect and customize, and they add over a dozen new ones every single month. You can also unlock free champions, equipment, and other cool stuff just for learning how to play, which includes Arbiter (one of the best heroes in the game). As far as graphics go this game speaks for itself. It‚Äôs honestly kinda crazy how much detail these guys squeezed into a free game and for your phone, especially when you consider what used to pass for epic mobile gaming not so long ago. Anyway guys RAID SHADOW LEGENDS is constantly expanding and adding new features, so it‚Äôs really never a bad time to give it a try. And when you do make sure you go to the video description and use the special link there to get a free epic champion and 50,000 silver as part of their new player program.",1606781003

"WAlitics","t5_3k21m","&gt; Then what, let a bunch of people get sick die? 

The implication is that letting walmart be open but gyms be closed means that sick people will stay alive. That's nonsense. The truth is that no matter what government policy is, sick people are going to die, because that's life. If you are sick and/or think gyms or other small businesses are dangerous, I would advise you not to go. Simple.

&gt; Should businesses come before people? 

Businesses don't come before or after: they *are* people. If I can't run my small business, I can't feed my family. If I can't feed my family, it doesn't really matter if there is a tiny increased risk of getting the flu. 

&gt;  and few alternatives have been found, there's little else which can be done. 

Nonsense. The media and the political left want to ignore countries like Sweden entirely now, but they live their lives unimpacted by lockdowns and have managed to deal with the virus on equal footing. Despite early claims about what would happen to them, their streets are not covered in bodies. Did people die? Of course, but again, that's life.

&gt; Stop buying things from Amazon, Walmart, and other big businesses, then  go support small businesses; they're still open and more than happy to  do business. Many now have online stores and can ship. 

Yes I'll just stroll right on down to my local gym and work out for a while. Oh, no, wait, he had to close down and sell. Ended up losing his entire life savings trying to keep it floating ""just two more weeks.""

"uklaw","t5_2qonh","I get the point, but can you blame academics? Studying the law as it is- very frustrating. Lots of going round in circles, or ultimately falling on one or another side of an unending debate. 

Perhaps more relevant is that people *new* to the law (e.g. students) have no reason to have a dog in any of the more mainstream legal debates. They‚Äôre not particularly gripping until you have a grasp on what‚Äôs going on, and at an undergraduate level a lot of the essays aren‚Äôt too much more than regurgitating talking points with a little bit of critical analysis. Snooze.

Throw in something that actually relates to the person (feminist critiques of topics will of course be of interest to feminists) or is relevant/engaging on a societal scale that people have opinions about (critical race theory, Brexit, gender identity, even the Covid essay I‚Äôm doing now which I initially hated the prospect of is far more interesting than any of the black letter stuff I‚Äôve done) and you‚Äôll get a much better reception, and likely performance. 

Why on earth would a student spend all this time reading about an unclear area of the law to eventually be able to have an opinion and contribute to the debate, when you already have a level of familiarity with another socially relevant area? 

I think there‚Äôs an important distinction to be made between being divorced from reality and being divorced from legal reality. ‚ÄòCritical XYZ‚Äô is always going to be disconnected from how things are, it‚Äôs kind of the point. It‚Äôs not irrelevant though. 

Not sure on a solution- more funding for more legally useful research? Try to promote academics less interested in progressivism and more in the law? It won‚Äôt change the fact that students students (who are the future academics!) want to learn and write about these things and go abstract. Infinitely more freeing than case law.",1606781005

""... [black] businesses often suffer from systematic oppression that makes their business more difficult to sustain. This includes any of the following:

- being located in majority minority communities not heavily trafficked by outsiders or tourists

- suffering from poor public funding which disproportionately affects minority communities (poor infrastructure, poor visibility/access, lack of other nearby attractions to draw in consumers, etc.)

- gentrification which greatly increases the overhead costs, meaning a once profitable business may start to struggle and eventually be pushed out

- the difficulty and risk of running a small business in general""

"MathHelp","t5_2qz84","Here, you have two equations that have the same two variables (each equation has **x** and **y**). That means that, if you rearrange one equation to get **x** on one side, then you can take whatever x equals and plug that into the second equation to solve for y.

*\*The example below might help, but it also might just confuse you, so the main thing you should look at is what I said above this!!\**

So let's say you have:

**eq1:** 2(apples) - 5(oranges) = 6

**eq2:** 5(oranges) - 5(apples) = 4

Then you can rearrange **eq1** to equal ""apples"", which would look like this:

**apples = \[ 6 + 5(oranges) \] / 2**

So then, since you know what ""apples"" is equal to, you can find ""oranges"" by replacing ""apples"" in **eq2** with **\[ 6 + 5(oranges) \] / 2**. 

So then you'd have:

* 5\*oranges - 5\***apples** = 4
* 5\*oranges - 5\* **\[ ( 6 + 5\*oranges ) / 2 \]** = 4
* 5\*oranges - \[ ( 30 + 25\*oranges ) / 2 \] = 4
* 10\*oranges - 30 - 25\*oranges = 8
* (10 - 25)\*oranges - 30 = 8
* (-15)\*oranges = 38
* oranges = 38 / -15",1606781006
"Conservative","t5_2qh6p","&gt; CNN and the New York Times dress themselves in good intentions by telling us we have a serious problem with racism, just as the communist media claim to be serving the people. In fact, by pushing this narrative of racism, the media are fomenting division. It is no accident that this summer we saw young people rioting and burning in our big cities. They have been trained to hate, just as in China, the communists trained people to hate. 

&gt; But in China the tool used was class struggle. ‚ÄúRacism‚Äù in the United States is for our mainstream media what class struggle was in China.

Scary accurate. Let's not forget BLM is a self declared Marxist organization. If they can convince everyone there's some sort of rigid racial hierarchy, they can convince everyone the only way to break it is to overthrow the ""evil"" and ""oppressive"" democracy.",1606781006

"C_Programming","t5_2qhoe","Malloc has to pass back memory aligned to certain byte boundaries. That's because it has no idea what you are going to use it for, and some CPUs are picky about doubles being aligned on 4-byte or even 8-byte boundaries. Malloc (most implementations) keeps a header just before the address it passes back to you, so the area is also going to be at least pointer-aligned.

So when you malloc, you probably get a minimum area returned - 8 or 16 bytes. You can test that by doing two consecutive mallocs, and then printing both pointers with the %p format option, and subtracting them (in hex).

All of that is UB and never to be relied on, but it does explain why using 2 bytes when you asked for 1 is unlikely to break anything.

The compiler can't throw a warning: your malloc might use a variable for the size, which it sets by checking a file size that didn't even exist when the code was compiled.

By contrast, for the case of initialising a char array, the compiler is reserving the memory for the variable, and the compiler is parsing the string you want to initialise with, so it knows it is bad. In fact, you don't need to specify the size of `test` at all, because the compiler will make it right from the initialiser.",1606781006

"JRPG","t5_2quw1","Suggestion #1: be careful with the scope of your game. Only commit to designing as much as you know you can handle. Especially if you haven't already finished creating a work of fiction or art. I've said similar things on r/visualnovels and its related community r/vndevs. My intent is to encourage people to finish writing a short story first. Afterwards, it's easier to work on an expansive / offbeat / dream project.

\&gt; Guilds have a very big focus in my game as I have always loved the idea of a bunch of heroes coming together and saving the world and though I LOVE RPGS with a fiery passion, I never really fell for the ‚ÄúAnd the war was won and the world saved‚Ä¶.by these 7 people‚Äù. 

No one ever built a statue to a committee. \^\_\^

That said, I might enjoy a video game in which playable characters can ally themselves with a guild or a faction. Maybe they can benefit by finishing loyalty missions. Maybe associating with a guild or faction can influence characters' alignment or reputation stats. (There were few games with elements like these on my favorite consoles from the last fifteen years: DS, 3DS, PSP, and Vita.)

\&gt;  What are some minigames/ideas you like seeing? 

I like shipping. Watching two characters develop a relationship is great. Maybe the playable characters can be matchmakers. Or they're given a reason to help break up a couple. I have enjoyed quite a few games in which a protagonist interacts with one or more love interests. It has been a challenge to find games in which two NPCs can fall in love. (This sometimes occurred in *Harvest Moon: Back to Nature,* and later sections of *Tokimeki Memorial Girl's Side*. I didn't get far into *Fire Emblem Awakening*, but this seemed to be an option.)

\&gt;  My game will have traditional turn based battles but I certainly want enough features to where just spamming attack will not cut it. 

I liked *Persona 4*, though I've also criticized it. That said, I liked its combat strategies. In the first dungeon, the player needs to learn elemental weaknesses. It doesn't take long before the player meets enemies who can reflect or absorb attacks. Light and dark spells, which can cause instant death, show up early on. Blocking can be crucial. Items which do fifty points of elemental damage can make battles easier.",1606781008

Thus, the decreasedB12content of various cooked foods appears to be because of thedestruction of B12by heating (Figure 2).

Not the most direct answer, but it *can*. It says other cooking methods like steaming, grilling, boiling, frying can do so too, but for these mostly evaluated B12 degradation in animal prdx. Just tryna help.

Well there was one team that had the QB coach for the local Arena team. He was a pudgy guy with no desire to run. So they had him like fifteen yards behind the line of scrimmage with a damn college long snapper firing the ball back to him to buy him time. Not that he needed it. He'd be calling out hot routes every play and have the ball in the hands of a receiver in the blink of an eye.

Goff often is required to drop back and pass more than 40 times a game. It's not fair to compare that to players like Tannehill who rarely drop back to pass. Easy to limit turnovers when your main job is handing the ball off to Henry.

Looked it up: since 2017 Goff has thrown more passes than everyone besides Brady. He also is 2nd in wins behind Brady for that time period as well.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","&gt;  They have shown through recent efforts to be moving away from that and trying to make builds feel more personal on a passive tree aspect instead of mainly being just gear that differentiates most builds. You would still have intrinsic identity on the tree per build but the tree would be more focused.

This sounds good written on paper, but when you need to spend 70-80 of your passives on traveling and getting defences like life/mana/es/ and damage mitigation like block/dodge, there's very few actual options for real customization, and those are almost always the ones directly on your path of the main ""defences"" tree (if we look at the vanilla skill tree). 

There are quite a few interesting nodes on the tree that won't ever get used because they are in a shitty unoptimal spot, like Searing Heat or Storm Weaver. 

That's why i love cluster jewels and timeless jewels (and to some extent thread of hope). They do what the basic passive tree can't: bringing true flavour (and sometimes really unique, like megalomaniac, or elegant hubris) customization options to the tree. But those are items again just like the gear, locked behind RNG or currency.

"travel","t5_2qh41","I agree with most of the things you mentioned... I never expect that Iran has the same number of tourist as Turkey, cause actually, Turkey is more a western country and Iran is an Islamic one... but the thing is Iran has a lot to offer for tourists who are traveling to experience something different from what they already had... yes that's true, for a traveler who wants to enjoy drinking alcohol or going to concerts or wanna swim in a bikini, Iran is not a good destination... but for someone who wants to know about the history, art, culture, and nature it could be a memorable place...  
And about all the things you mentioned I have to tell you more about each of them:   
\-about alcohol and dancing, if you get to know local Iranians, many of them invite you to their houses and parties where you can find really good alcohols and dance in any outfits that you like...   
\-about swimming and wearing a bikini at the beaches, there are many places where you can swim and sunbathe with your family in their swimsuits... just need to know someone who can help you and show you the right spot... just check the [4th picture of this album](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/jv3i0w/qeshm_hormuz_islands_iran_2020_these_geopark/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) I posted before.  
\-about the internet, we all access to anything we want thanks to many different VPNs that are available for free for us and as you get to the airport you can ask a local to send you his VPN app for you and then you can access anything you want... so it's not a big deal for any Iranian here :)  
\-healthcare, you really need to search more about it... Iran has really great doctors and medical tourism is a big portion of tourism in Iran and many western people come to Iran for their treatments as it's much cheaper for them and the quality is almost equal to their countries...  
\-Products you mentioned, We have Coke, Pepsi, and many more western products here... and if someone's reason for traveling is to eat Mcdonals instead of eating local foods then I think he doesn't get much from traveling...  
\-About the guided tours, it's just for citizens of the US, UK, and Australia... so there are still 192 countries left...  
\-About Israel yes that's right... stupid political policies :)  
\-About marriage, it's completely wrong... no one asks if two people are married or not... not in the process of visa appliance nor in the hotels... the restriction for booking hotel rooms only to couples, it is for Iranians and the tourists are the exception.  
\-ŸéAbout sexual orientation, no one ask you if you are gay, lesbian, etc... yes it's weird for people to see two guys holding hands in public :) but they can do anything they want in their privacy... so I don't think it's a big deal...  
\-About punishment laws, it's a bit exaggerated... it's not as serious as what western media shows...  
\-And finally, about picturing people and governmental bldgs, I think it's more polite to ask people if you can take pictures of them or not and I'm sure there are less than 1% of people in Iran that say no... most of them like to be in tourists photos and even much more will ask you to take pictures with you :) and about taking picture of governmental bldgs... I'm sure there are many more attractive sceneries and bldgs you can take pictures of instead of governmental bldgs...  


so the most important thing when you travel to Iran is to get to know as much Iranians as possible then you can have an unforgettable memory and Iran will be the best place you ever visited (with a little exaggeration cause I'm an Iranian:))",1606781010

This follows the logic of everything that is new, is trendy.  Any new game, by new I mean 1 to 2 years old, will obviously get more promotion from the stores and word of mouth goes around and obviously there will be a considerable influx of new players.  MFF is 5 years old and the marketing side of things should focus on keeping its player base, instead of trying to get newer players as the influx of newer player will simply not be the same compared to a new game.

The main problem is that, I would like to stop seeing it ""out for delivery"" and after I stay home to wait for it, it does not arrive, then that night they update it to show ""delivery Exception"" and some BS as to why they did not deliver it.

Eu n√£o sei muito bem, mas voc√™s dois parecem se gostar muito, por√©m cuida primeiro do seu cora√ß√£o, ele precisa de cuidados e colocar algu√©m dentro dele tem grandes chances de n√£o dar bom, ent√£o, primeiro cuide de voc√™ para depois colocar um amor dentro dele.

N√£o acho que ser bv seja ruim, eu tamb√©m sou, mas acho que quando for o momento certo vai acontecer e voc√™ n√£o precisa ficar pensando nisso ou pensando o que ela vai achar, as pessoas pegam experi√™ncia com o tempo, e t√° tudo bem.

Obs.: Se valorize para as pessoas valorizarem voc√™, voc√™ √© bonito da sua forma, do seu jeito, com suas qualidades e defeitos, e n√£o deixe ningu√©m te colocar para baixo.

I think the funny thing is a lot of people didn't really make much effort to change it because they internalized prohibiting liquor sales on *church day* as somehow a legitimate moral exclusion, especially since its likely been around since 1930 or so.

Fireworks bans seemed more legitimate, since its pretty easy to make practical claims about them being dangerous.  And a lot of people just hate them because they're loud, scare their pets, etc.",1606781013

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;Because they wouldn't be the first and only and sole descendants either.

What do you mean by this?

&gt;But not all people unless you redefined people to be only classified as  his descendants which is showing how far you are stretching now to  justify this.

No, I mean all people. Anyone who was alive 100,000 years ago or whenever this hypothetical event (that I don't even believe in) occurred, who has any living decedents today, would be very likely to be the literal ancestor of literally every human in recorded history.

&gt;But your argument is now that God intervened somewhere of unknown and  unknowable time to utilize a second definition of humans and man to  justify this intervention.

What do you mean justify? My point is that the first anatomically modern human to have a soul could reasonably be considered to be the first human or to not be the first human, depending on whether you are using a scientific or theological definition of human. 

&gt;You then say that sin is some non-descript and unknowable action

No, I'm just not defining it because for the purposes of my argument it doesn't matter what the original sin was. If it is a metaphysical event that is described by a metaphorical genesis, then yeah, you could say that it, like many things divine in nature, is hard for humans to comprehend and only approachable by metaphor. That's hardly a new way of approaching theology.

If it was the first-human-with-a-soul idea that I described, then it could even be very literal! God could have literally said ""don't eat from that tree"" and then he ate from that tree et voila, damned for all time.

&gt;(we haven't gotten into whether or not the ""person"" even knew they were  doing something wrong for which all of its descendants were punished)

It doesn't matter, that's a different argument. I don't think that the doctrine of original sin describes the actions of a just God either. 

&gt;You also assert that this can align with science by wholly removing it  from anything which is in any way measurable or detectable and saying  that these things align

Yes. That's how it can align. I'm not saying that science *calls for* a belief in this, simply that, if you believe in God, it does not preclude it. If science called for a belief in it, I would believe it. I don't. The fact that it is unmeasurable and undetectable means that science does not and cannot have nothing to say about it. Since science cannot say positively or negatively whether such a thing occurred, it is possible to believe in the scientific consensus as well as in either of these understandings of Genesis.

&gt;I have a dragon in my room, you can't see it because its invisible and  you cant do anything else to test it...  But this aligns with your view  that there is no dragon in my room because of this.  WOW

It is possible to align a belief in an invisible dragon in your room with a belief in your room existing. Is it wise to do so? I don't know, I've never had to deal with an invisible dragon. But is it logically consistent to believe in an invisible dragon and also believe in your room? Obviously yes.",1606781013

I don‚Äôt know if it would work realistically, but the idea is that each partner is 50% of the partnership so has a sim total of 50% of the responsibilities, yet not each person is capable of doing so which is signifies by the percent they can contribute. If possible, finding a medium between the two might be fair to both situations. If one partner earns say $40,000 and the other $60,000, then for things divisible by 10 one partner would pay 40% and the other 60%. However, being equal in the relationship depends 50/50. So to balance, one partner could contribute 45% while the other 55%. So for say groceries of they spent $500 in one month, the one who makes $40,000 would spend $225 and the one who makes $60,000 would spend $275.

Glad to say that I reached nearly all of them, except for the dieting/fitness goals (sadly). In the same spirit, here are my goals for 2021, with a blend of side hustles, career, and FIRE:
 
**Goals for the rest of 2020**

* Hit stretch net worth goal of $400K+ (fickle, as this depends on the market)
* Release 1 video per week for YouTube and not be so fixated on the views/analytics
* Finish up CS50 lectures and wrap up homework assignments
* Try to eat healthier and keep exercising

**Goals for 2021**

* Net worth goal: $500K, with stretch goal of $600K
* Max out Roth IRA (backdoor), 401k (contribute high % earlier in the year), HSA, and beef up E-Fund
* Chill out on FIRE-fixation and enjoy being dual-income for the first time
* Keep producing content for YouTube, aiming for at least 50 videos on the channel with my current gear!
* Complete at least 2 side projects in my GitHub repository
* Transition over to SWE and get over incoming imposter syndrome
* Take a vacation if covid can ever cool down

Definitely less technical than my last set of goals, but thinking about FIRE, net worth, investments, etc too often has been mentally draining. I'm going to try to be healthier, both mentally and physically, and just be happier overall. I've made it a big point since the midway portion of 2020 to automate FIRE as much as possible just so it doesn't occupy too much of my headspace.",1606781014

Easy option, low salary: take an online IT course and apply for county level positions, they have low standards. When you've done that for awhile you can maybe move to something state/federal and make a medium salary.

Easy option, low salary: Army signal corps. If you end up not liking it you can't change career until your enlistment contract ends. Specifically army and not other branches because the other ones actually have to do things. Take practice ASVABs and study before doing this because you probably won't score high enough on electronics/comms to get any of the good jobs, 25Q requires 98 in both.

Autism option, high salary: Get your degree while doing signal corps reserves and become an officer. More paperwork though.

Do you know if it was reported on at all in the media? Again one of the local libraries (and I know there aren't many, and they all seem to be small!) might have some old media records, newspaper articles etc in their archives. 

If none of those people or places can give you what you're looking for, they might be able to point you in the direction of someone who can. 

I really hope you find the answers you're looking for.",1606781015

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Racism isn't real which they justify by arguing America is too great to be racist, Obama was a Muslim, climate change isn't real because it snows occasionally, the wealthy shouldn't be taxed or over-regulated because socialism is bad and abortion is murder because God says so. 

Do you have any basis for believing that the number of Trump supporters who reject those statements are negligible?  In 2016, 60% of Trump supporters believed Obama was Muslim.  What about now?  What about the 40%?  What about the other beliefs?

One of the best things about the movie is the cast. If a person tells me they watched it, but that Alice Krige didn't leave them with lingering discomfort, I wonder if they really paid attention. 

As is often the case, the book is so much better than the movie that they aren't even in the same ballpark. Two characters who figure prominently in the book, but not so much in the movie, make up one of my favorite things about the novel in general. Straub's eye for detail and ability to actually translate it to paper, his digressions, and his insights into human beings are just part of what makes it such a fun, creepy read.

How far dose something like dmt go, regarding the very real experiences and influences it has long term on sociological development? 

This is a informative sub, but I don't see much information, that isn't just a dmt trip or supportive affirmation on its use or extraction. 

 In fact, critical clames suggesting anything other that what dmt influences individuals to think are usually dismissed within the consensus of dmts teacings.

 Eveything is a cult, from gamer's to skater's, but dmt characterises a seriously distressing fortitude of principles for the individuals using it, creating an almost immediate disregard for any claims not in alignment with its influences.

"Costco","t5_2rsgr","The fact of the matter is that your employer made a decision as to how they feel their employees and customers will best be protected while still being able to do business and as employees, the managers who choose to continue employment there need to remember who is making their payroll deposit. There should be no difference between an employee who doesn‚Äôt follow a policy that is set for wearing masks and an employee who doesn‚Äôt follow a policy that is set for uniforms or a dress code. If the set policy isn‚Äôt illegal, the employee (aka managers in this case) should expect to be fired for insubordination if they don‚Äôt do what their employer directs them to do. 

It seems that you‚Äôre probably stuck in a situation where upper-level management has no idea what‚Äôs happening and would possibly turn a blind eye if someone did notify them - potentially even leading to retaliatory actions.

To Democrats--he's got Republicans breathing down his neck and wanting to push him out, from Trump to Jim Jones to this guy John Becker. Give him a fucking break for trying to meet in the middle.

**Hell is a lonely place**

he was 65, his wife was 66, had  
Alzheimer's disease.  


he had cancer of the  
mouth.  
there were  
operations, radiation  
treatments  
which decayed the bones in his  
jaw  
which then had to be  
wired.  


daily he put his wife in  
rubber diapers  
like a  
baby.  


unable to drive in his  
condition  
he had to take a taxi to  
the medical  
center,  
had difficulty speaking,  
had to  
write the directions  
down.  


on his last visit  
they informed him  
there would be another  
operation: a bit more  
left  
cheek and a bit more  
tongue.  


when he returned  
he changed his wife's  
diapers  
put on the tv  
dinners, watched the  
evening news  
then went to the bedroom, got the  
gun, put it to her  
temple, fired.  


she fell to the  
left, he sat upon the  
couch  
put the gun into his  
mouth, pulled the  
trigger.  


the shots didn't arouse  
the neighbors.  


later  
the burning tv dinners  
did.  


somebody arrived, pushed  
the door open, saw  
it.  


soon  
the police arrived and  
went through their  
routine, found  
some items:  


a closed savings  
account and  
a checkbook with a  
balance of  
$1.14  
suicide, they  
deduced.  


in three weeks  
there were two  
new tenants:  
a computer engineer  
named  
Ross  
and his wife  
Anatana  
who studied  
ballet.  


they looked like another  
upwardly mobile

"books","t5_2qh4i","Super Short answer, as many have said, world building.

Long answer: Elves, dwarves, and humans are one thing, sure. Many fantasy stories involve them, so when you hear how the many character is going to meet dwarves or is one, you already have an idea of what dwarves look like and are about. The story teller then just needs to tell you about the parts about their dwarves that are different.

But, if your dwarves are reallllllyyyyy different or if you have a race or species or etc. that is completely new to the reader/player/viewer, well you are gonna need to explain that or they won‚Äôt care or get confused or both.

In addition, areas and weapons and castles and myth are critical to the fantasy genre. It‚Äôs really difficult to write exciting fantasy without the ‚Äúfallen empire‚Äù that came before. Not impossible‚Äîjust very difficult. Fantasy needs the civilization from long ago that fell that people either know little or nothing about to fill all of those dungeons and forgotten castles with mystery and treasure. A kingdom wasn‚Äôt likely built in a day, so you need a history‚Äîwho was the first king, why they became a kingdom, what the wars were, what are their beliefs‚Äîwhich all become relevant when you have another kingdom that may be opposed to your first kingdom for ideological/religious/political reasons (worship the opposite god, lost a war, etc.)

Lastly, you have the magical elements. Not required, but most fantasy has at least minimal magical elements with High Fantasy having common magic. Since magic isn‚Äôt real IRL, you‚Äôll need to give some context on how magic works in your world. Which again requires more world building. And while it could be it‚Äôs own section, I‚Äôll just lump it here so my comment doesn‚Äôt get longer than it already is, but you‚Äôll likely want Gods too, even if they aren‚Äôt real in the story. Maybe magic comes from the gods, or not, or both.

TL;DR the writer has to worldbuild to give grounding and life to the fantasy, no matter how crazy the fantasy is. Good worldbuilding leads the reader to imagine the world clearly and believe that it could exist. And questions lead to more connections rather than confusion. You don‚Äôt have to worry about worldbuilding as much imho the closer your world is to reality (if my world had the FBI, I wouldn‚Äôt likely have to fully explain what the FBI was and it‚Äôs history unless that was relevant to my plot, for example. But the Umberfolk of the Dusktooth Vale probably need at least a paragraph).",1606781020

"magick","t5_2qhk1","So....I'm not sure just how much you've studied, or practiced, but some clarification seems to be in order here.  
True Will as opposed to personal will.  A persons True Will can be thought of as their reason for being in their current incarnation.  Obviously there is more to it than that, but for this discussion that is the thing to keep in mind.  Part of the overall goal of any Spiritual System leading towards any form of spiritual illumination is learning what the person reason for being in this current life is.  This goal, the attainment of some understanding of the individuals True Will, is an ongoing process.  It is a process of discovery and refinement that can take a lifetime.  Depending upon the system that is being worked, and the tradition that one is working in, this is sometimes a process that reaches a form of fruition with the 6th sephirah on the Tree of Life.  The crossing of the Abyss, however, is an entirely different matter and I suspect, contrary to what many might say, that this crossing is something that very very few people will experience in a single lifetime of striving.  


Stop looking for things to change in your life, and begin looking for change in yourself.  Deep introspection is what is needed.  Magick is about personal change and personal growth.  As the person begins to change then things in the environment will change as well, but that initial impetus must come from within the person.  This doesn't mean that the change/changes will necessarily be nice ones.  Change can be, and often is, very hard.  This type of change, however, is often what is needed for personal growth.  It is not about changing anything other than ourselves, and as that process begins, outer change will follow it.    


In regards to the point of existence, the answer to that is, I feel, right under our noses, yet we refuse to acknowledge it as the reason, and we feel that there must be more.  The one reason that I would give for our existence is simply this;  To learn how to become more loving, accepting, tolerant, compassionate, and responsible beings.  To learn how to best mediate these qualities to the outer world, and how to best nurture these qualities both within ourselves and others.  


Here's the thing that I think that a great majority of practitioners of our Magical Arts seem to never realize.  As a human being the Universe seems to work in a certain manner.  Part of that manner is that in order to grow spiritually, we have to begin learning to nurture those qualities of love and compassion, and only to the extent that we do so do we also truly progress upon the spiritual path.  This does not mean that life will be easy, but what it does mean is that unless and until we are ready to begin truly walking the spiritual path, we will not and do not grow spiritually.  A prerequisite to that true spiritual growth and understanding is becoming more compassionate, more loving, more understanding, more thoughtful, etc., and the manner in which to start is to make the conscious decision to do so, followed by true spiritual study and ritual work.  It's the desire to change, to become a better person, a fuller human being, and better human being, that signals those on the inner levels of life that we are ready to begin the process of change.  


Holding this as an attitude gradually leads to a gratefulness for life and being alive, for our relationships, the people around us, the food that we have, the roof over our heads.  Looking to be more compassionate and filled with life for self and others, including animals, leads one to an appreciation of life itself, and leads to a sense of wonder about it all.  


The cure for most of our ills is stated above.  People don't want to accept that as an answer, and yet it can't be any more obvious than what I have stated.  Utopia isn't some far flung idea that only exists in fantasy books.  Utopia is something that could exist in this world if we would collectively make the decision to act in the manner that I have discussed above.  It's a decision that is within our grasp, every moment of every single day.  And yet, we collectively make the decision to not live our lives in that manner, and collectively that is the decision that we make every single day.  So, this better world is right there, just a decision to become more compassionate, understanding, tolerant, etc.  Just a decision away, but as a species we don't believe that it's possible, that this couldn't be the reason that we are here.  


And yet, it is the nurturing and growth of those very same qualities within ourselves that leads to true spiritual growth and understanding.  All of the rituals, meditations, incense, regalia and instruments....all of this will avail us nothing if we do not approach this work with the correct frame of mind to begin with.  That initial impulse must come from within the person, then the banishings/invocations/meditations will do what needs to be done to further growth in that direction, but that initial seed within the person has to be the correct one if true spiritual growth is what is sought.  The true change and growth is within the person, and this may or may not constitute change in the objective world.  It likely will at some point, but that outer change can be very tumultuous before it evens out.",1606781020

This is what's called an extinction burst. The fact that he sunk so low as to fake his death to try to manipulate you shows exactly how desperate he is. He lost the object of his control and he can't stand that his manipulation and intimidation doesn't work on you anymore. First he tried playing on what was your love for him by telling you what he thought you wanted to hear; ""I'll go to therapy,,, I'll change... I'll be better.."". When that didn't work, he tried scaring you and making you feel unsafe by using the tracking device (and probably access to your google or Samsung account) to spy on you and send you creepy messages based on what you were doing. Then you had the gull to not only still not go back to him but instead you blocked him everywhere and moved in to your own place!! The nerve!! /s. 

So he escalated to threatening letters and trying to gaslight you by trying to get you to believe that everything was your fault... that you're an awful person and he's the poor poor victim. And to his utter shock, that didn't bring you running back, on your knees begging his forgiveness. Instead, you served him with a restraining order. So he did the only thing he thought would surely work. Got your ""friends"" (so glad you cut them all off btw) to try and play on your sympathies by claiming he was dead. See, in his mind, you'd blame yourself and feel so guilty and sad so when you showed up to ""make arrangements"" and he popped up very not dead (""Surprise!"") you'd be so relieved that you'd forget everything that had brought y'all to this point and he's finally have his (literal and emotional) punching bag back. He'd also have the added benefit of holding the fact that you left over your head which in his mind would justify the (even worse) abuse this time.

See, it's all a game. Everything he does is designed to either frustrate you into going back by either convincing you that you were the problem, or that you'll never be safe if you don't go back. This ""apology"" excuse is just the next desperate attempt to find an opening back into your life and into your head. I'm so so so beyond proud of you for not falling for any of it. Keep those letters and voicemails. Make copies and send a copy of each to the lawyer, keep a copy with you, and maybe a few copies elsewhere just in case (one thing that works well is creating a whole new email address just for this purpose (don't use a password you've used on any of your other accounts) and send everything to that email and then delete the ""sent"" messages from your regular email account. If you can afford a safety deposit box at the bank (I think some of them rent them out for relatively low amounts) those work well too. Just keep doing what you're doing. Keep leaning on your support system, cut off anyone he's used to try to get to you or any mutual friends who could be sympathetic to him. Keep your head up. You're doing great. He'll burn himself out eventually.

The anxiety part is more difficult. I've seen it referred to as spectatoring. Basically I'm more fixated on my partners experience of me during a sexual encounter than my own experience.  Which leads me to get nervous/anxious and can cause me to go soft.",1606781021

"MuslimMarriage","t5_39x1d","&gt;that's exactly the opposite of how our religion teaches us to go about courtship

I don't agree? There's ample evidence in our traditions of meeting the person and asking others about that person's character to vet them. There's even a hadith where the Prophet tells someone to look at the woman he's considering marrying so he knows that she's pleasing to his eye. It's not on the level of cohabitation for years, but, like, you should know the person before you marry them and you are given the space to do that. 

Look at the example of most Muslim couples and you'll see that they knew each other and communicated for some time, sometimes extensively, before committing to marriage.",1606781021

My family always named our dogs after food.

Don't get me wrong, she was awesome, and acted like a puppy until the day she died, but she'd get jealous and drop our phones, remotes, etc into the pool.

My last dog was named Henna, but I got her when she was 11, so she was already named. I also had a friend with a corgi named Eevee! Corgis are my favorite.

Solid odds, pretty straightforward to play. We‚Äôve got three strong 2:1s, and six viable safeties between them. We‚Äôll skip Sproggie, who starts at 12:1, since Dan is far stronger than him. In bet three, we‚Äôll chase Tailhook, just to squeeze a little more TER out of our strong 2:1s. Other than that, we‚Äôll play the remaining five safeties, as well as one double-upset scenario.

28% to bust | 70% to profit | 32% to triple.

""As it turns out, you do not need to drill the optic, and this is the easiest TIR based version to open. This method doesn't damage any part of the light at all. All you have to do is take a box cutter style razor blade and wiggle it left to right while applying pressure to work the tip of the blade under the bezel. Once you feel it go in all the way, give it a slight twist to begin to separate the bezel from the optic. After that, move over a bit and repeat the process. After doing this 2 to 3 times you will have enough space to insert a small flat tipped screwdriver, which you can gently twist and the bezel, optic, and seal will fall right out undamaged.""

 ""Packing for the Job You Have, and for the Job You Want

Overloading a ship with more cargo is certainly something a lot of pilots have asked for, and it‚Äôs something we‚Äôre going to support. Because cargo will be able to be lifted and placed by hand, the player won‚Äôt need a cargo grid underneath them in order to place it, meaning they can release those commodities anywhere. We encourage players to want to store their cargo securely though, otherwise a myriad of additional challenges may await you.

The more you carry, the more mass you‚Äôre trying to move around, the more adverse your ship‚Äôs efficiency is going to be. If you‚Äôre exceeding mass recommendations with loose cargo just placed wherever you‚Äôre going to throw out a ship‚Äôs interior balance and place more strain on thrusters of one side than the other. The flight system will do its best to compensate, but expect to burn through fuel a lot faster and risk additional component wear-and-tear than at an optimized weight.

Additionally, as we develop our physics for internal behavior we are looking at room temperature, atmospherics and other forces to act upon the player and when cargo isn‚Äôt secure, these systems will act upon that, as well. **Future updates will see inertial forces act upon a ship so that every bump or a bang from combat, re-entry, quantum jumps etc. will knock around anything unsecureed in the cargo hold, potentially causing it to suffer damage. While the extent of damage remains to be seen, expect some loss of integrity of the goods you‚Äôre shipping if not being stored appropriately. Also: keep an eye on any loose cargo if someone opens an airlock, too. With nothing keeping it in place, your goods will find themselves at the mercy of any decompression suffered.""**",1606781024

Bianchi's crash was so horrific that this would not change anything. Massa was hit by a small flying part which would not have been blocked by the pathetic amount of coverage it offers to the drivers head. I'm fuming, it seems like a bullshit decision made by the FIA to feel as if they are doing something. Motorsport is a dangerous sport and anyone that races accepts this. What's the point in corrupting it's integrity for no real gain, a 200mph crash is just as serious without a stupid flip-flop around your head.

It doesn't sound like it **has** to be reliable if you can write off the most reliable options just because you're not a huge fan. A mazdaspeed3, eclipses/talons, etc are all cars that tend to be driven harder and will likely be in worst shape as many are now 10+ years old.   


I would consider a regular mazda3 as a good option, even better if you can swing a '12-13 skyactiv mazda3.

Much of that money wasn't actually theirs but instead belonged to a government that was overthrown by the Iyatolas.  Therefore we had no obligation what so ever to hand that money over.  Regardless if it was their money or not, Iran is an enemy and Democrats helped them get billions of dollars thus committing an act of treason.",1606781026

"polymerclay","t5_2s48h","You probably won't find a paint that can take long soaking (like polymer clay can) and that can be used directly on polymer clay.  Most paints (like acrylic paint) and clear liquid finishes are water-based, so with continuous submersion they'll usually soften, loosen, and begin peeling...and the finishes will likely also become cloudy.  They're generally water*resistant* rather than being water*proof*.   
However, clear epoxy resin (Envirotex Lite, etc) may be close to truly waterproof so I guess you could try that over acrylic or other safe-for-polymer-clay paints.  

Or instead you *might* try coating the clay with a safe-for-polymer-clay paint or finish, let dry thoroughly, and then coat that with a not-safe-for-polymer-clay paint (e.g., some ""enamels"" or solvent-based clear finishes)...both should coat every part of the figure.  Then perhaps try heating that to see if you can make it more waterproof.  

Btw, using glycerin can help prevent some things when using bare polymer clay in water over time, but it doesn't help keep paints/finishes from softening and loosening over time afaik.   

This page at my site has more info on putting polymer clay into snowglobes, waterglobes, fountains, etc, where it will be completely submerged and for a long time, if you're interested:

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","&gt;are my efforts maxing classes and getting good gear and such going to be obsolete if I upgrade?

Maxing your classes? No. Upgrading does not render that obsolete, only lets you continue leveling them. You're just leveling them from 1 to 60 sooner rather than later, is all.

Gear? Kinda. Your level 60 gear will be rendered obsolete in the same way your level 50 gear was. It's an inevitable consequence of the leveling process, and you should aim to start replacing it around 65, or at least most of it. You'll be a little stronger than other people who haven't grinded out a max-ilevel set at level 60, but ultimately that advantage will taper off about half-way through Stormblood as it always has for other expansions.

----

Personally, I wouldn't bother going out of your way to get a fully maxed out, augmented level 60 set, and I certainly wouldn't put off upgrading and leveling past 60 for it. Leveling dungeons will give you a piece of gear that you don't already have for every completed run, so you'll be replacing pieces rather quickly. Taking a week to fully max out the gear on all your jobs at level 60 is a week you *didn't* spend progressing through the story and leveling beyond that cap, meaning you'll be further behind and weaker than you would be otherwise.

Just get what you can afford with your Poetics and fill out the rest via leveling dungeons from 61-69. It's a far more efficient way to spend your time than grinding out way more poetics to max out every job.",1606781026

It‚Äôs still easier for large companies to comply with though, so this new move is probably an advantage to large companies like Netflix and a disadvantage to small sellers which want to sell into canada. Many might not bother. 

If the government only charges it for companies above a large amount of revenue it might work. 

In general I‚Äôm not a fan of ‚ÄúTax X to pay for Y‚Äù schemes. It rarely leads to good policy. If digital companies need to be taxes, do that for its own reasons. If childcare is a good idea, pay it from general revenue, etc",1606781028

1: You actually have time to lock eyes with them in the first place.

2: They're not so out of it you can lock them in.

"CoronavirusUK","t5_2f3oes","To respond to a small point of your comment, the different is not that this vaccine was speedy, but that normally the process is stupidly slow. Not because of science, but because of bureaucracy. As someone in academia (although humanities) but who hangs around a lot of scientists who do vaccine work, what has been cut out of COVID vaccine process to get it down to a year is essentially all the waiting time. That helluva lot of money usually requires multiple grants, which takes years to apply to, then get etc. Governments were throwing money at developers which cuts down years. For other (less critical) vaccines, a lot of researches spent quite a while simply twiddling their thumbs waiting for Agency X to do Test Y etc. Basically, the COVID vaccine projects have shown how inefficient the system was, and how efficient it could be when everyone's mind is focused on one outcome. It's a good sign for future public health issues that we could so this, and hopefully will lead to reform within the current system.

Also, and I don't have an answer to this, the problem with being anti-mandatory vaccine because you don't want to force your views, is that this is actually also a viewpoint which you're forcing on to someone. Since vaccines require a critical number of the population to be vaccinated for it to work, as about 5% of the population cannot have the vaccine due to other factors, by choosing not to have it, you're also imposing that risk on those people. It's different to other mandatory things where it really only effects you. Like if the government said you have to wear a red shirt. First, that's stupid. Second, it has no impact whether you where a blue shirt or red shirt really. But with vaccines it's more like a school saying no peanuts because this one kid is deathly allergic to even peanut dust, and yes its just one kid and you really love peanut butter but please. If you decide that since you're not in class with that kid you're probably safe to have a peanut butter sandwich, then that's still your viewpoint. Again, not saying either way is right, just philosophically noting that it's still the imposition of a viewpoint on another person although not quite so directly.

KH1 Aero made you literally unkillable, and short hop Blizzard's were insane damage for almost no mp.

KH2 Firaga in final form allowed you to stunlock basically any humanoid bosses as long as you didn't use finishers. Reflect could single handedly win fights if you had a tiny bit of patience, and that's ignoring the fact that it's a longer guard.

KH3 gives you access to -za grand magic accessories in the first world, you can use waterza to delete entire bars of health literally in Olympus. It's also amazing area damage in a game where single target is borderline unusable.

Kids, learn your tools and use them. The KH games were never the same for me when I started casting spells.",1606781031

Then you have people who are crafting to level their professions at any cost, and only see selling the by-product as a way to offset the cost of leveling by what they can get.

"NarcissisticAbuse","t5_2ys1m","Therapy for abuse can be daunting to start even when you have experience in getting therapy. First, I would say be sure your therapist is specifically experienced in treating victims of abuse. Abuse is not a bad relationship, its like addiction, the abuser the drug, with very real brainwashing and conditioning tactics. Its more like healing from Stockholm Syndrome or leaving a cult then it is a relationship. You want someone who is knowledgeable about best practices and how to deal with it because not all therapists have any training in that area and well meaning or not, can do harm if they dont have it. You need the right tool for the job. 

Secondly, it can help keep it from feeling overwhelming to write down a timeline of things, of some key aspects of the abuse and toxic behavior, and even your history before that relationship started. You can give it to your therapist and have a copy for yourself. That way you can add on when you need to and get your thoughts out in advance. 

Third, its going to take a while to work through all of this. So do go in expecting to work on pieces at a time. I recommend that you collect your thoughts about the last session and what you thought about it (this is after your first session of course) and even write down some notes to help you stay focused going into the session. And you can take an hour after the session to write down some thoughts you have about it and to work through any feelings that came up in the session a bit. Those two hours, one before the session and one after, are really for you. Thats your time. 

I wouldnt worry about putting labels on things or people. Focus on the actual words and actions and how they made you feel. Take it one step at a time. Be patient with yourself. Show yourself the love, care, compassion and kindness you would a friend or loved one going through this. You deserve that and no less will do. 

And remember, therapists arent your friends and they arent there to sit in moral judgement of you. They are there as a tool to help you to get where you need to go. So feel free to say things truthfully and to be honest. It will not be the worst thing they ever heard, or likely even the worst thing they heard that day. So let it go. Be free. Get it out of you and work through it. You deserve that.",1606781032

Insider buying is simply a great starting point in analyzing a company. 

Of course, some insiders will have a bias, however, that is why it's important to look at cluster trades where insiders are in consensus on the value of their company + future prospects. Especially, when the CFO buys, it is generally a very good sign as they are generally realists and less lenient with their spending. 

On the last point regarding institutions, it's important to find companies that, in addition to insider buying, are largely ignored and undervalued",1606781033

I think it's a good thing for there to be people who lean into the pains of particular areas of bad design, and then vocalize it in spite of other things. I'd rather have people angry at resin and the exploitative practices of the company, even if they are jerks sometimes. I'd rather hear critiques of the company than praise. I don't think the company needs to hear praise unless it specifically informs ways to make a better experience for players. I mean, I get the good feelings of their good design choices just by playing the game anyway. 

I get that the company is made of people with feelings, and I think that it's great to be able to show them support for their work. But MHY is a company, and the community isn't. We barely have the faith to believe they'd listen to us about anything. I think it's better for players if all MHY sees is resin complains and then they make changes to the resin system.",1606781034
