It was less of a medical call then last time too, but during the evacuation it got worse. Everyone sliding on the mud and running. It was insane. 

We were warned a few hours before it happened too, and I told some people by me to be aware that they might need to leave because of weather. Some were understanding, but a lot of people were very unreasonable and violent about leaving. Security has been getting the shit end of the deal with EZoo. We only follow direction and enforce rules and safety. ""Fuck EZoo security"" gets on my nerve because we aren't with the event itself, we're an outside company.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","It kinda sounds like you might have a finicky metal allergy coupled with the fact that your ears probably were already irritated from having been pierced with guns previously. Maybe try titanium next time if you do, since its hypoallergenic so they contain no nickel or lead. I'm going to go out on a limb and say the CBR's you got were most likely 316L or 316LVM stainless steel which still have nickel in them (albeit a very low %, but if you are already super sensitive it doesnt matter).

If you do end up putting anything back in them I recommend titanium or Teflon (PTFE). Ask your piercer if these options are available. 

As for your stretched lobes... I seriously could not tell you. The only thing I could think of is if you had been wearing steel jewelry, its possible they might have been acting as weights. Its not likely to happen but it does happen. The best advice I can give you is to go back to your piercer and explain the situation so they can troubleshoot with you in person and also be able to take a look at how your ears are doing.

Good luck!

&gt; They have literally no other option.

Your narrative is very peculiar to me and it makes no sense at all. 

The USA joined the Allies in 1941 because they were attacked by Japan. It wasn't Canada who aligned themselves to the USA ""because they were extremely weak"". US and Canada share the same values, which is why they've always been allies. The UK and Canada and the US share a bond as English speakers, and have been allied in one way or another since the 19th century. Britain and France were also allied - also neighbours. There is no hint at all in the Western democracies that they'd immediately turn to communism without the US to guide them. There is a tradition for democracy, judeo-christian values and common language for some. That's why they're aligned.

Now if you have a video of a Marine with all his gear shooting his big rifle, then you see an helicopter blowing shit up and finally you see a glorious Navy ship cruising the sea with its thousands canons, that might make you want to sign up.

"Patriots","t5_2rx57","&gt;you should apply for a job at the front office, obviously you have access to the win-button
seriously, afterwards its easy to call out any decisions being made

Some decisions are easy to call out before they are made.

For example. Tavon Wilson.

Another example. Garappolo's contract runs out in 4 years. brady's runs out in 4 years. You can't cut Brady because of dead money. So essentially you will have to pay Garappolo before he actually proves anything. 

&gt;from what i've read, you didnt provide any solutions, did you? even if you did, it would be pointless, cause there is nothing to prove AFTERWARDS

Just because I can't prove that anything I will do will work out doesn't mean I can't call out somebody for doing stupid things. Plenty of people criticize Obama. Do they think they can do his job better?

&gt;esides, your looking at that VERY one-dimensional
the pats relied on their offense for years
they now adressed that big time in FA...extactly what you demanded

They got Lafell. And overpaid for Edelman when they have Amendola. Yup. I'm impressed. 

As for defense, getting revis now doesn't excuse the last 15 years. The squads that won the sbs were the ones that Parcells and to a smaller extent Carroll built.

&gt;in case you still didnt get it, offense wins game, defense wins championship...look at the broncos, all their offense was useless at the SB

Just because the Seahawks beat the Broncos and the Giants beat the pats doesn't mean defense wins championships. The seahawks btw average the second highest points per drive last year only behind denver. 

Look at the 49ers dynasty, the Cowboys dynasty, the pats in 04, the broncos when they won, the saints, the colts, the ravens when they got hot in the playoffs. 

&gt;so cause we didnt surround brady with twelve dozen future HOFs (which exactly, btw? and which exactly the past year? wallace? rofl) its another wasted year?

When you put your hof QB in a position where his best target is Reche Caldwell or Julian Edelman you aren't doing a good job at all. 

&gt;PS: hernandez was great while he played, right? god, i should stop going over that moot points

I have no problem with hernandez being drafted where he was. What I have a problem with is hernandez getting a guaranteed contract with a lot of guaranteed money and no behaviour clause in his rookie contract.

"excel","t5_2qur2","I was trying to walk you through basic problem solving steps.  In most of these types of problems, the solution ends up being trivial with a bit of googling.  That you've been working on it for 3 days tells me something is off with the way you are going about it - its not an excel issue and its not a VBA issue.

In short, you're probably trying to google the Excel version of [""How to Draw an Owl""](http://i.imgur.com/RadSf.jpg) and becoming frustrated because things don't work that way.

If you could describe it step by step in English, I can almost guarantee that you could google each step and get an answer that you could put together yourself and it would have gone a long way to enabling you to solve your own problems.  You know, give a man a fish vs teach a man to fish.

For example, how do you copy the contents of a workbook?  You open it, copy what you want, and close it.  Literally the entirety of what you want to do can be boiled down that simply.

Your response to my attempt to help was rather snide and you completely ignored the advice given.  You've not once that I've seen this entire thread asked a *specific* question or anything beyond ""How do I solve my entire problem all at once"".

We often lack the context to do that, and it takes round after round after round of revision, often with the person on the other end of things just doing the needed copy pasta until they get something that works.

I don't really have any idea what you *expect* given the nature of the question.  Maybe you should take your own advice.","1409529608"

I was stretching my pennies for several years.  A diet of whole wheat bread, peanut butter, beans, a bag of apples, some random vegetables, and cheap meat in smallish quantities was my usual menu.  This is WAY cheaper, yet WAY healthier than anything ready-made or in the junk food aisle full of stuff marketed to kids.  

Is the problem that grocery stores are not in the slums in the UK, so that it's a several pound/dollar trip to get to the food?  Are they drunk/high, so that food comes from the nearest quickie mart's junk food section?  Do British taxes make everything too expensive whatever you choose?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I didn't try per se, but I was so close and knew that if I did start, I'd succeed. Anyway... The last two years have been the worst of my life. About 10 months ago or so, I just gave up on everything. I came home every day tired and completely out of my mind. I was at the end of my rope. I was sleep deprived since I just couldn't sleep, which just made things much worse. One week, I spent every minute of every night thinking about killing myself, how that would be a relief, and how I'd stop being a burden to everyone. I didn't really have anyone that I could talk to since I really had one friend at that point, and she lived across the country. Then, one night, I decided that this was it. Before, I always thought that I'd write notes/letters/whatever to a few people, but that night, I couldn't bear being alive for any second longer than I had to be. I said, ""Fuck it,"" and I grabbed a knife. I put it against my carotid artery. I took a breath and started to press down pretty hard. I suddenly had an epiphany and stopped. The only reason was that I hated myself and my life so much. It sounds contradictory, but I wanted myself to suffer since, well, I hated myself so much. It's kind of a weird loop thing. I broke down, and I laid in my bed for the rest of the night.

My friend kept begging me to get help for months and months before that, and I finally did that since I realized I wouldn't finish out 2013 if I didn't. I'm in a better place now (yay...), but I'm still depressed, some nights much more than others.","1409529611"

That's because those genres often contain fantasy and sci-fi scenarios like Love Spells, Sex Pollen, Vampire Pheromones and Aliens Made Them Do It. The authors want readers to be able to distinguish between a story where character A is brutally raped by character B and a story where A and B have mutually satisfactory sex which they don't regret afterwards, but which they probably wouldn't have had if they hadn't been exposed to the spores from that alien plant in chapter 2.

"pcgaming","t5_2qhfg","I trust 2 sources for video game reviews.

1) My friends, since they already know what I like, and can judge if I'll like a release accordingly.  One of my friends in particular is so freaking good at sending me links to Steam games I enjoy

2) The user section of Metacritic.  People who aren't paid to review games give the best reviews of games

I see sites like IGN and Gamespot to be entertainment sites, not informational sites.  Lets be honest here - most of the reviewers don't even finish the games they review, can't give scores that are lower than 7 or higher than 9, and don't have appropriate resources or time to judge the limits of how good a game is.  They don't have my personal tastes, they can't properly assess game difficulty because they don't have time to focus on learning mechanics, and they have to worry about truly trashing a game lest they get fired.

There are some Youtube personalities that have gotten very popular for game synopses and reviews.  An actual ""game journalism"" site can aspire to be that effective, at best.","1409529618"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","All addicts are addicts. There's no distinction between one or another, at least not by the literal term. However, you'll have the addicts who rob, steal, physically hurt others, and really go to extremes to get their fix; on the other end of the spectrum, you have the ones who, while being manipulative, scheming, and resorting to some level of thievery, aren't terrible people (even at their worst). 

I would personally think I'm the latter. I did steal from my mom, when I was at my worst, but I never resorted to burglary or actually physically hurting others. Over the past 4 years, I've been paying my mom back (as much as I can, when I can) and so far I've been able to give her around $17,000. I still owe her about $15,000, but I absolutely intend on clearing my debt.

I have no idea what you and your family have been through, although I do know of addicts that have completely fucked up the lives of people that love them, the only people that love them, to the point where they're disowned. It's always sad to hurt the ones you love/d who are also the ones that love you. Luckily, I didn't get so bad that I did irreparable damage to my relationship with my family.

I bring up not knowing you or your situation because of what you said about ""fuck drugs and the people that do them"". Yes, fuck drugs. Absolutely fuck them. But the people are people. And therefore, are inherently flawed and more susceptible to the grip of addiction. Addiction runs in my family, and it runs the gamut from alcoholism to gambling to narcotics. Weak-willed people I suppose. But in my opinion, it's very easy to say ""fuck the person"" when you've been hurt by an addict, but it's also easy when you've never had to deal with it.

It sucks.

I'm sure that if 95% of addicts had an option to skip the withdrawal, fill the hole in the soul that most use the drugs to fill, and then go about their lives being happy and healthy.. they would choose that option. But it's not that simple. Think of how many people struggle with tobacco addiction, knowing they'll most likely die from a painful and terrible cancer, and yet they still continue to smoke/chew/rub. Now imagine that quitting tobacco leads to 2+ weeks of intense sickness (like the flu, except way worse). Imagine that a major reason people use tobacco is because they feel it's the only way they can feel any joy or happiness.

I'm just saying that it's easy, from the outside looking in, to say ""Fuck the addicts. They need to stop."".

Sorry for the rant/wall-o-text. I hope maybe I could have provided a little insight into what it's like for me and maybe your brother. Best wishes to you and your family.

Also, sorry for any spelling/grammatical errors.","1409529619"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","(Word of warning, my She-Hulk knowledge comes from TvTropes and *Marvel vs Capcom.*  I haven't actually read her comics.)

I don't know what Goyer said, or who he is, even.  I will say that a character being generally sexy or having an active sex life isn't a bad thing, and that there's something to be said for simple titillation value.  

She-Hulk, in particular, has a number of characteristics and behaviors along these lines:

* Active, positive sex-life *in universe*
* Flirty attitude
* Lots of observational humor, including observational humor *about her flirty attitude and positive sex life*  (To Deadpool: ""If this were the Nineties, I'd be hitting you with the health bar!"")

(She's also a smart, successful lawyer and a decent martial artist, among other things.) 

If anything, it's cool that you can have a heroic character- *and a lawyer, no less* who's this confident and in control of her own pleasure, and for whom pleasure *isn't a bad thing.*  

As for her origins?  Total cash grab from back when ""X character, with a twist!"" was really popular.  (Supergirl, Krypto the Superdog, Ace the Bat-Hound, etc, etc).  Hell, She-Hulk was originally a *sketch comedy* character from *Saturday Night Live* or something similar, and Marvel decided they should copyright it before somebody else did.  She was something silly that actually turned into something smart.  

Sexy can be smart.  Sexy can be virtuous.  There's nothing wrong with sexy.  Sexy is an intrinsic part of us, a part of being human, *and it's one of the good parts.*  If anything, I'm kinda jealous of She-Hulk and characters like her because they get to be sexy.  I'm a pasty, squishy white guy; I can be lots of things, but *Imperius Sex* ain't one of them.  In the end, every creative effort is an attempt at bringing something the creator likes into the world.  Something cool.  Something smart.  Something sexy.  In a way, *everything* is fanservice.  An artist should be a fan of his own work.  That's part of what makes it art.

**Let's bring sexy back.**

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","One cell has, iirc, about 6 billion rungs of DNA. DNA is made of four different nucleotides joining in pairs. So you would have 6 billion to the eighth possible combinations in one human cell. That means there are about 1.3x10^39 possible combinations. So basically you have to realize how much time that would take. To put that into perspective if you were testing one combination a second it would take 4.1x10^31 *years* to test them all. So we're not talking lifetimes, the entire length of the universe doesn't begin to approach that. Even if you got to the point where you could test billions of combinations a second you wouldn't approach anything close to a reasonable amount of time.


Sorry if that's hard to understand, I don't know about your math background and so on but it is hard to explain numbers like that in a way they can really be comprehended - it becomes more like random numbers on a sheet of paper.

If protectionism preceded man, if protectionism existed before man invented it, then it is part of the state of nature. Then, I am wrong.

But it is as man made as the Eiffel Tower. To that extent, free trade preceded protectionism, and therefore it was a welfare distortion. There's no way to defend KH improvements in justifying ending protectionism because protectionism was uncompensated in the first place.

EDIT: The mere fact that protectionist policies have to be enacted before tariffs and the like exist implies that there was free trade before protectionism. 

In other words, if we passed a law saying that September 25th is national puppy day, that implies that there was no such thing as national puppy day before we passed said law.","1409529632"

In exchange for some peace or disarmament or acceptance, Israel removes settlements, when the Palestinians piss off the Israeli government, they build another.

A friend of mine had a few settler friends who were very pissed off with the Israeli government for how they are treated.  The fact is that houses in the settlements are very cheap and ideal for poor Israelis (thus no rich settlers).","1409529638"

* Give Ukraine money (heck, if Greece and Spain borrow at 2%, EU fiscal authorities could cough up ten or twenty billions for UA)
* Provide all military support that doesn't require legislative approval - surveillance, decryption, UAVs from Israel etc.
* Tell Putin that Ukraine will never be a NATO member
* When Ukraine rebuilds its army and stabilizes internal situation hit Russia hard with sanctions for annexation of Crimea. Hard as in asset freezes, overall trade ban etc. This one is kinda questionable, destabilizing a nuclear power is not a thing you would normally do.

As far as I understand Ukraine and West need to call Putin's bluff. I think C-130 carrying humanitarian night vision sights would be enough.

Even if the West doesn't care about Ukraine it should care about its reputation and show it's not to be fucked with.","1409529638"

If my friends and family died, I would definitely feel a sense of loss, like I didn't get to interact with them like I wanted to. Because regardless of if I hang out with them, I never really feel sincere around people, this is probably why I find interaction so draining. 

I have a lot of work to do, and I try to tell people that it in no way reflects upon them. But some people don't understand, that's just life. ","1409529640"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I think couples counseling would be *wonderful* idea. I think it's a good idea for every couple tbh. 

Also, re what I said about accommodating her sex drive, I just wanted to add that I'm speaking from personal experience. This last fall I had a bit of a hormone kerfuffle, and my sex drive just *plummeted*. My poor bf had such a hard time with it, because I had literally no interest in sex. What made it worse for a while is that he kept trying to initiate sex at the same rate he's always done, and I eventually started resenting him for it. I felt like he was putting me under so much pressure to do something I didn't want to do, and I also felt really guilty that I didn't want to sleep with someone so wonderful and sexy. Luckily, my bf was so lovely and patient with me - he made it clear that he didn't expect me to do anything I didn't want to, and he let me sort of take the lead on our sex life for a couple of months, so I didn't feel as much pressure. 

Something that really helped us (in addition to me getting counseling and medication) was him backing off on the sex stuff a little. So, for example, he stopped initiating sex *every* morning, and we started scheduling sex more so I wouldn't feel like it was being sprung on me. We also watched a lot of porn together so that I could be with him while he got off, and we learned a ton of new ways to be together sexually that didn't involve actual sex. We also started talking more about fantasies and kinks, and exploring those together helped us start having sex that didn't feel like the old routine. In retrospect, the whole thing was a bit of a blessing in disguise. So, patience and open communication will really help you here. ","1409529644"

I would go with somebody with a proven track record for updating an existing app. And even in this case, make sure to look carefully through the existing feedback of the guy with completed contracts. I have had to deal with scammers on websites like eLance and oDesk - even though in web development, not game development - that had dozens of feedbacks. Feedbacks can be fabricated, as well.

If I were to go and commit a crime with a gun why would I use one that is registered to my name?

In Canada there are fewer gun crimes than the US, but I have honestly never really heard of anyone being stabbed to death here. In Canada stabbings are very common. People will always find a way to kill each other. I'd rather die to a gun shot than be stabbed or bludgeoned to death.

There are a lot of things that happened that would be considered much more severe crimes than murders by a firearm in other countries and they are actually quite common.

It's not that gun laws make it easy to get access to firearms it's the fact that the United States is a VERY large country with boarders that are far too easy to cross illegally. It makes it extremely easy for illegal arms traffickers to bring firearms into our country. Our country has a problem with organized crime simply because there is so much money and too many open roads you can't easily police.

Every country has organized crime and where there is organized crime there are illegal firearms, so yes you can easily get a gun anywhere.","1409529649"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm a girl but I was rather rough as a child, able to justify pushing or kicking my friends with whatever I was feeling at that moment. This was also in elementary school. After I made a kid bleed after kicking him in the shins, and another incident where my girl friend's parent had to address me for pushing her down on the curb, I eventually let the bullying let up. 

I can't remember for sure what I felt at the time - I think more than empathy it was guilt, knowing what I did was bad and not quite sure how to explain why I did it. Heat of the moment. I didn't realize how much pain I could inflict on people and it always kinda surprised me when I did hurt them. Didn't know my own strength or something.

Anyway, the people I hurt most were the ones closest to me, but I eventually grew out of it. I'd keep an eye on that situation though, and bring it up to a school therapist or someone of the sort if at all possible.

If it's any consolation, I turned out completely normal decades later, save for the rotting bodies in the cedar closet of my basement. Peeeerfectly normal.","1409529651"

2. If too many people ""take the jail sentence"", they'll replace that with execution, to ""facilitate"" your choice. When a country (well, its leaders, really) decides to go to war, they will have their soldiers one way or another.

People have been forcefully drafted for hundreds of years.  The practice might have stopped recently (on a historical scale) in the civilised world, but I am pretty sure it's still used in some places on the globe and it can be brought back in a second if needed.","1409529657"

But, thinking it over, it's probably a very simple and straightforward answer because pretty much all of science can answer that question in a boring way that may lead nowhere new (audio frequencies, biology and geology, physics, psychology, engineering... something that way).

I got the thought from a documentary on Frank Gehry. He had a designed a very obtrusive yet visually appealing building that was built in the middle of town. A local there said it ""looked like a space ship landed there a thousand years ago and we just built around it"" [I'm paraphrasing]. Buildings have a quiet timelessness to them, as if there's a maturity or wisdom there

Then again, there are poorly made buildings which break apart and make actual noise.

But anyways there is a sense of quiet in both ""loud"" and ""quiet"" buildings.","1409529657"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","We've seen it happen before. Also, for the team that is 2-0, they should be scared. It's not as simple as having 3 more tries. Momentum means a lot, but imo, the momentum you gain from winning that third game from being 0-2 is probably more than the momentum the winning team brought from the previous two games combined. 0-2 has nothing to lose then suddenly gain new life, while the team that had the momentum reached a high just to crash and burn, possibly being demoralized more than the two games the losing team experienced combined. This is why bo5s are the best. They still contain quite a bit of volatility, but it's the perfect amount of games to pressure people to adapt quickly, both strategically and emotionally, and it's not a crapshoot like a bo3, and if everything were a bo7, we wouldn't get sleep.","1409529657"

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","This is what I messaged DrScientist786.  Maybe it was a little to long:

I know your feeling.  I was there too.  This issue was what caused me to leave Islam.  I know how you just know that there must be some explanation.  But here's how I see it.  Mohammed was a man of his time.  And during those times, slavery was just the reality.  And when a man owns a female slave, of course he had a right to have sex with her whether it was in Rome, Persia, China, and even in the State Mohammed ruled.  The PROBLEM is we can do better.  YOU KNOW we can do better, and we have done better.  WITHOUT the Islamic Sharia and the Quran and the Ahadith.  Now Muslims will talk about how the slaves should be treated well, and how there are ways to work for their freedom(If the master approves), or how if a Man has sex with a female and she has a child from him that she becomes Umm Walad and can't be sold.  But yes indeed this was a normal part throughout Islamic History.  As you mentioned, Mohammed had slaves, Umar ibn al Khattab had slaves, so did Uthman.  Harun Al-Rashid The Abbasid Caliph was the son of another Abbasid Caliph and his Yemeni Slave Girl.  Where do you think the concept of Ottoman Harems came from?  Ottoman Sultans and people who could afford it at the time, had HUGE buildings where they would buy and house dozens or even hundreds of women for his sexual pleasure.  And there are of course no limits to the number of female slaves.  In the Ottoman Empire, they even build their armies through slavery.  They had a system called the Janissaries where they would take young east european christian boys from their families around when they were 10 years old and convert them to Islam and raise them to be soldiers.  And that was the official Army in the Ottoman Empire for hundreds of Years.  And what ISIS is doing today to the Yazidis(with respect to slavery) was common practice not just in the islamic world, but the WHOLE world just 300 years ago.

Now you may be saying ""Alright I see that Slavery has been a normal part of Islamic History but how do I know this is actually allowed by Allah?  How do I know this isn't just Cultural traditions that have infected the perfect and Just Laws of Allah?""  Well here is the proof.

Please read these following Ahadith.  From the Quran, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim only.(I am ofcourse assuming that you come from a sunni background.  Sorry if you are not, I don't know Shia Islam too well, but atleast the Quranic verses still apply).  JUST READ the following and analyze it objectively.  Just Try.  Keep in mind that ""what your right hand possesses"" is just a euphemism for slave.  And *Coitus interruptus* means pulling your penis out from a woman's vagina before ejaculating.

1) Quran (Surah 4:3)
&gt;If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or that **which your right hands possess**. That will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.

2) Quran (4:24)
&gt;Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (slaves) whom your right hands possess.

3) Sahih Muslim ([8:3432](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3432))
&gt;Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that at the Battle of Hunain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and **taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists**. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:**"" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (Quran 4:. 24)""** (i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came to an end).

4) Quran (Surah 23:1-6)
&gt;**Successful indeed are the believers**. (1) Those who offer their Salât (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (2) And those who turn away from Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). (3) And those who pay the Zakât. (4) And **those who guard their chastity** (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). (5) **Except from their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame** (6)

5) Quran (Surah 33:50)
&gt;O Prophet (Muhammad SAW)! Verily, **We have made lawful to** you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and **those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allâh has given to you**, and the daughters of your 'Ammat (paternal uncles) and the daughters of your 'Amm (paternal aunts) and the daughters of your Khâlat (maternal uncles) and the daughters of your Khâl (maternal aunts) who migrated (from Makkah) with you, and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her; a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, - in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (50)

6) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:459](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.459))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: ""I entered the mosque and saw Abu Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu said, ""We went out with Allah's messenger for the Ghazwa (attack upon) Banu Mustaliq and **we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus**. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus we said ""How can we do coitus interruptus without asking Allah's messenger while he is present among us?"" We asked (him) about it and he said ""It is better for you not to do so, for if any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.""

7) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:637](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.637))
&gt;Narrated Buraida: The prophet sent Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus ([one fifth] of the booty) and I hated Ali, and Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, ""Don't you see this (i.e. Ali)?"" When we reached the prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, ""O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?"" I said, ""Yes"" He said, ""Do you hate him, for he deserves more than that from the Khumus.""

8)Sahih Bukhari [5:59:512](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.512)
&gt;Narrated Anas: The Prophet offered the Fajr Prayer near Khaibar when it was still dark and then said, ""Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned."" Then the inhabitants of Khaibar came out running on the roads. **The Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.** Safiya was amongst the captives, She first came in the share of Dahya Alkali but later on she belonged to the Prophet . The Prophet made her manumission as her 'Mahr'.

9)Sahih Bukhari([3:46:717](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/046-sbt.php#003.046.717))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Aun: I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the **Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning** while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. **Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives**; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 'Umar was in that army.

Alright now that you have read this, I imagine you are feeling mind Fucked like I did when I read this.  ""HOW? WHY? There must be some Hikmah(Wisdom) from it that my puny brain doesn't seem to understand?  I should not cause Fitna because I am not an Islamic Scholar.  Maybe what we don't understand that Slavery was very deeply entranched system and Allah abolished it gradually(like he did Alcohol)""  To that I say, the position that slavery should be abolished is better that Allah's Laws on slavery""(BLASPHEMY)  But it is.  You have a moral compass.

Look at the following verse of the Quran:
&gt; Oh you who believe!  Today I have made unlawful unto you the taking of peoples into Bondage.  How could it be that a man is a slave to another man, while all men are the slaves of Allah?  And if someone from amongst you asks to be compensated(for freeing their slave), then tell him to await a reward greater than the world and everything in it.  That is your promise of your Lord. The Merciful.  The Just.

And you know why you have never heard of this Ayah?? Because it doesn't exist in the Quran.  YOU KNOW, that an Ayah like this is missing from the Quran.  WHY?  Because the Quran is not the book of God.

I know how it feels.  I went through this already.

Just Remember.  Most People around the world are following the wrong religion.  And you might just be one of them.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Potentially you would be right, but your analogy is a bit inaccurate. First of all you need to remember this is how all utilities work except during shortage. Internet is even less taxing than any other utility. The internet is not like a single truck or car. There is little reasoning behind bandwidth caps. The only limits are how much bandwidth per a second they can allow on whatever system they have built. If they calculate the maximum sustainable bandwidth and divide that by their users they have a guaranteed output. But they don't even have to meet this. It is unlikely they will even have to meet 50% of this. This is also essentially how banks and insurance companies work. They know not everyone is going to be taking out all their money at the same time, even though you can. The FDIC requires that the have a mandatory minimum percentage. If they calculate what is essentially peak hours and build in a margin of say an additional 20% they are essentially covered. Remember you are talking about AVERAGES, you are not looking at an individual server or individual power user, you are looking at the system as a whole. Which creates much rounder more predictable numbers. Wear and tear and gradual increase in demand is to be expected. You are not looking to baby an individual car. It's more like roads.

Fujifilm still makes [Instax cameras](http://instax.com/), and the film for them. They have various models: Instax 210 (wide), Mini 7S, Mini 8, Mini 25, Mini 50S, Mini 90 (the black one with all the dials), and others (including discontinued models). The website outlines the differences between the still-in-production models. I got an Instax 210 and film for it at my local Office Depot a couple years ago, and I think they still sell it.

Not counting his Arsenal years, Kroenke has owned major sports franchises in the USA for a total of 58 seasons (basketball, football, soccer and hockey combined).  In those 58 seasons, his teams have won 2 league titles (1 football, 1 hockey) and 1 Cup (soccer).  That doesn't look to me like the record of a billionaire whose highest priority is winning titles.

But going under the assumption that you start with two trees, and keep inbreeding offspring, you will not have any increase or decrease in height without adding in another individual.
Think of it in humans as such: you have two individuals (a boy and a girl) whose parents (and ancestors) usually start growing facial hair at age 20. If these two were to mate at age 15, produce a boy and a girl (who you then mate ((yes genetics can get weird in hypothetical situations)) at age 15), if this process were to repeat for X number of generations, it would be thought that after X generations, they still being growing facial hair at age 20.","1409529679"

"roasting","t5_2t80t","What roaster are you using?

Regardless, the bean temperature should not level off at any point during the roast. This is called ""stalling"" and results in baking of the bean instead of roasting. Baking changes what chemical reactions take place, and introduces a flat character to the coffee with other flavor taints. You're likely not going to notice this a huge deal with a monsooned coffee, as the monsooning flattens the original character and replaces it with the musty spice you've experienced.

&gt; My charge is constant from 0 to 6 minutes and the temperature levels out starting at 3 minutes. Does that leveling point indicate the time where the bean has completely dried?

No. In fact, the drying phase is a misnomer, though it is important. A lot of water is lost during this phase, but if too much water is lost, certain development is altered resulting in taste defects. This phase should be between 4 - 6 minutes on drum roasters, and 2-4 in fluid bed roasters. There should not be a leveling off of the bean temperature, but a constant progression through this phase. A short drying phase can enhance acidity, a long can develop sweetness, body, reduce acidity. Too short and you get a cup of lemons, too fast and you get a cup of boring.

&gt; I understand that the exothermic reaction starts at C1, and how the charge should be slightly dropped at the start of C1, because the heat in the bean will carry itself.

The beans will not carry the roast on their own. However, you should definitely drop the heat progressively through the roast because the *roaster* has built up heat and can slowly carry your beans through the end of the roast (albeit with still some heat application).

&gt; This is not happening for me here. If I drop my charge there, the temp drops ten degrees, and C1 stops. Then I have to bump it back up for it to start again.

You're stalling the roast. Again, rates of change &lt;= 0 for your bean temperature are bad. You need to be applying enough heat going into first crack to get it going before you drop your heat, otherwise you'll stall and negatively affect the development of sugars and other flavors that only really develop during and after first crack.



As an example of a typical profile, here is a drum roaster profile of an El Salvador bean, posted by the coffee importer Cafe Imports: http://www.cafeimports.com/grinder/San_Gabriel_Roast_Profile.png

This is the general shape the vast majority of drum roaster profiles will look like, though the timing of the different parts of the roast will vary. There are exceptions to overall shape, but I think this is a good reference point. Notice the constant rise in bean temperature (in red) through the whole roast.  Also notice the green line, demarking the application of heat, and the blue line is a measure of the air temperature through the roaster (i'm not going to address air flow here, though).

The beginning of the roast shows the drop in measured temperature as the beans are dropped into the roaster. Notice that not much heat is applied while the bean temperature and roasting environment reach the same temperature (the bottom ""well"" of the roast curve, called the turning point). Not much heat is applied because there is plenty of heat stored up in the preheated roaster, which is transferred to the bean through conduction.

Right around the turning point of the bean temperature, the heat is turned on quite high. The heat is left on high through the whole ""drying"" phase from the starting temperature up to about 300*F. During this time, your applying heat both to the roaster and the coffee. Thus you're building up momentum that is important for the rest of the roast. 

Just after the drying phase, when the beans are nice and evenly yellow-tan, the first drop in applied heat occurs. This will slightly drop the rate of rise of the bean temperature to slow things down a bit to ensure proper development.

The heat is left untouched from there until a little before first crack, where it is dropped a bit further. This is where soft beans, like Brazils or this El Salvador, will pick up speed, so it is important to plan for this with low grown beans. Hard beans, like Kenyans, can take, and need, the heat to get a good first crack going, so the drop in temperature should be less than with a soft bean.

As first crack is ending, the heat should be further dropped, as this is where the roast will really take off if you're not careful. The degree to which you drop your heat will determine how long it takes to get from the end of first crack to your final temperature. This time is the ""development time"" and drastically alters the flavor of your coffee. Like with drying phase, shorter development time leads to brighter acidity and less roast tone. Longer development leads to caramel and roast tones developing while acidity drops. Too long is boring, too short can be sour, intense, or undeveloped/grassy.

I have been stable for 16 months or so and haven't had any relapse, so it looks like I won't ever feel the focus, power and joy from another manic episode as long as i'm on lithium..

However I wish I could use mania to my advantage, but p-docs told me it could lead to another psychotic episodes+ further brain damage. I don't see how this is any usefull in my life atm besides getting my kidney's and possibly tyroid destroyed...

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hmm! I totally thought to myself that if I ever got the chance to moderate the subreddit I frequent the most, I would, so here goes nothing. I didn't post my application right away because I had to think about making the commitment and now that I thought about it, I'm sure I can do a good job. Anyway, on to the questions!   

**How old are you?**

18

**What time zone do you live in?**

CDT (UTC-6)

**What time is your availability?** 

Since I'm currently in senior year, my mornings are a bit out of reach, however I'm available from 3pm to 12am

**Do you have previous experience in moderation or community management (reddit or elsewhere)**
 
Sadly no, I had never been so involved in an online community as I am now.
 
**Do you have an expert knowledge of the subreddit's rules?** 

Yes, I believe so. 

**How familiar are you with in-game mechanics and Pokémon legality (RNG abuse, hacking &amp; legality analysis, TSVs/ESVs)?** 

Very, the only one I might not be as much is RNGing as I haven't actually tried to RNG myself. 

**Do you have experience with web programming (HTML/CSS)? Graphic design? AutoModerator? Python? IRC bots?** 

I took about 2 months worth of C++ last year and my current senior year includes a fully fledged Python class, I might not be great, but my skills will become more polished as this school year progresses.

**What is one thing you would change on the subreddit if you had the power?**

Just a minor thing that drives me nuts with the Shiny Charm flair. In comparison to the Cherish Ball Flair which needs 75+ Trades (Must include at least 65 shiny or event trades, with a minimum of 25 event trades) 33% of the trades need to be event whereas for the Shiny Charm flair 150+ Trades (Must include at least 140 shiny or event trades, with a minimum of 70 event trades) 50% need to be event trades, I'd tone it down to 50 event trades so it would become 33%, just like the Cherish Ball Flair.

**Do you strongly disagree with any of our rules? Why/why not?**

I do not disagree with any of the current rules and that's one of the main reasons I trade here, all the rules are in place to ensure the community sticks to certain (let's call them values) and the same rules discourage scammers to join, they make it a hassle to join, but once you get the rope of them, they are very very easy to follow.

**What will your mod flair be?**

Only the best Pokemon to come out of GenV: Chandelure

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hopped a fence with two friends to go winter camping (camping was only allowed in the summer there). Hiked about half a mile off trail and set up camp. We all fall asleep with me on one end of the tent, my friend on the other end, and his girlfriend in the middle.
I'm woken up like two or three in the morning (wasn't sure, I just knew that it was pitch black) by a person standing directly outside the tent pointing a flashlight inside. His shoe was literally standing on the edge of the tent. He stayed there for god knows how long just pointing that light. Then, he circled around the tent and walked away the opposite direction.

I thought it couldn't have been a park ranger, it's closed, wintertime, it's hard as hell to walk around cause there was a snow storm that weekend, WE'RE NOT EVEN ON A PATH; who the hell could this possibly be??

I'm shitting bricks; my friends are still sound asleep. I've pulled a small hand axe we had near me just in case. Not ten minutes later, THAT FUCKER COMES BACK. Circles the tent again, stops with his foot right where it was before. Can't hear breathing coming from him or anything else, just that god damn light (this was in the Rocky Mountains in the US so he could easily have a gun and I'm not about to make a sound). Stays there for god knows how long me shaking in my sleeping bag holding a shitty axe. 

Then he just walks away back where he first came from. Never had anything else happen that night. Why would my friends believe me? Didn't say nothing to them....","1409529684"

"truetf2","t5_2stfn","&gt; If you get a shit ton of points its either their pyro is really aggressive and you get a lot of extinguishes or you are doing something wrong

So if it's not because of extinguishes you're doing something wrong? That's not really the way it works.

Sticking with the combo is the pyro's primary duty yes, but what makes the difference between a good pyro and a great pyro is the situational awareness to know when you're safe to leave. You can get things done anywhere on the map. With combo or with flank. If you know your combo is safe you can (and should) be leaving to be effective in the 15-20 seconds free time. This is why powerjack was a big choice before the axetinguisher nerf.

As you advance in leagues you want to *get out* of the habit of sticking only with the combo. It's still your main concern, but as I mentioned above, you *need* to be leaving the combo at times, to assist your teammates. Because just like you said, the pyro is a utility class, he should utilize his abilities in more than one area.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","I was expecting the vehicle to be used for taking out mid range infantry and light armour with the gunner, to cover deploying infantry or to provide close air support to small fights.

The weapon I was hoping for would be quite good against infantry, a large cone of fire when fired for long periods of time but quite large explosion radius so it would be used for the same purposes of the 30mm on an Apache gunship. The rounds would be good against harassers and flashes, but tanks and lightning would be able to shrug off the damage.

In summary I wanted the Valkyrie to be a suppression support vehicle, something infantry run away into buildings for, not unlike the zepher in some regard. At the same time the vehicle shouldn't be able to hang around for long due to risk of being sniped by tanks or just taking sustained small arms fire.","1409529689"

The lad himself would be mortified if he knew what she was saying about him.

I have great respect for the lad. Fairplay to him. It's a difficult career and well done to him for being able to cut it in the army.

That said, a lot of people who would be well able to do the same, including my brother, would be capable of it, if they were bothered.

Some might think I'm talking out of my arse, but I know a few soldiers and physically they are in very good condition and have had to endure punishing training, but they chose it.

I like to call the organization ""logic"", myself.

EDIT Lol this is what you wrote!

&gt;This is why /r/buttcoin has to be run in some way by shills. It may not have started this way, but some of the people there are obviously spending their time 24/7 trying to bring Bitcoin down by any mean. Some of the arguments on there are plain ridiculous, pronounced either because of profound ignorance or plain intellectual dishonesty.
It's not just Big Bank doing it, it's also a lot of alt/app communities coins doing it. Some people think it's Bitcoin vs app coin, when in reality, everybody benefits from a strong Bitcoin and a strong app coin industry.

You are literally the embodiment of fucking stupid. I do this shit for free because it not only entertains me (posts like yours are COMEDY GOLD, JERRY, COMEDY GOLD!), but sets the precedent in the future when this whole house of cards collapses around you that I was right all along.

I don't know why you guys don't understand this: There are people in the world that invest professionally. Many of them. And many of them either are very smart, or have tons of very smart people working for them. If bitcoin was going to succeed they'd be throwing money at it hand over fist, but they're not. They don't give a shit what you use as currency, gold coins, dollars, internet funbux, deer skins, used condoms. Whatever. If it could make them the right ROI, they'd invest in it. They don't have some silly moral crusade that clouds their financial and economic sense like you do, thus, they're not investing in your bullshit scam coins.

Have fun wasting your money on this tripe.","1409529691"

"Sororities","t5_2v0zk","Not gonna lie, the flip flop/shoe thing is so outlandish that I don't believe it's the reason you didn't get invited back to Preference round.  You were just dropped by every sorority on campus prior to Pref.  And honestly, as much as it sucks, the fact that you didn't get bids through basically every avenue of joining an NPC sorority means that you might have exhausted all your options.  If you go to a school with a large Greek life presence this means they probably don't take many juniors, and if you don't have lots of friends in sororities (i.e. more than one per chapter) that are willing to fight for you already then you'll probably not be successful again.

You have to take a step back and evaluate everything about you're presenting to a sorority when you go through any sort of recruitment process.  Is your GPA awesome?  Can you carry a sparkling conversation, including explaining why you're still looking to join a sorority as a junior?  Can you articulate what you're involved in on-campus?  Do you have recommendations from sorority alumnae?  Can you dress well and look good regardless of your size?  If you can't do all of these things, and if multiple chapters didn't take you before as a freshman with four years of sorority membership before you, what will make them want you now with only two?  You have to prove to them that you're worth a bid that could be given to a freshman who will be in their chapter for twice as long as you.

You also have to figure out for yourself how devastated you'll be if you don't get a bid, and whether that's worth putting yourself out there again.  Rejection is hard and since you state that you've been hurt pretty deeply by it before it may not be worth the risk.  Only you can decide that.  

I don't think you have a great chance of being successful, but I wish you all the best regardless.","1409529693"
"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","Discrete math definitely uses a different portion of the brain than calculus and other straight-forward apply-the-formula classes.

It's much more about problem solving and analysis.  (Though make no mistake, it does have formulas and such.)

If you're good at memorizing and applying formulas [that is, solutions], you may not like it.

If you're good at thinking through problems and coming up with solutions on your own, you'll like it.

You'll notice a large crossover between discrete math and algorithm design in CS.  For instance, graph traversal, or set manipulation.  Those aren't situations where static formulas are a big help, and yet they're certainly mathematical.

Discrete math can feel like an algorithms class, the way relational algebra can feel like a database class.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","My bf and I went through a bout of this.  He was busy and stressed from work and doesn't have time or energy for sex.  I was horny every waking moment.  We eventually did open up the relationship.  It wasn't easy but I think overcoming that problem together made us more connected.  Now that we're long distance for a few months, it really helps that we don't have to worry about the sex issue since we already gone through the process of discovering and talking about what's acceptable and our comfort level.  

Make of it what you will, but that's one anecdote of it working.  

I was the one who brought it up.  I conveyed what I felt, the value I place on sex in our relationship, what I think the effects will be if we continued to go on as we were, and my thoughts on the solution being to open the relationship.  Then I asked for his feedback to whether he sees it as a problem, what he thinks of my solution, how we can improve on it so that we both feel comfortable.  It was a long conversation but that's the gist of it.","1409529695"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You can't really measure a speed at which the expansion is occurring, the more distance between you and what you're measuring, given that  distance is constantly growing, the faster it will appear to be moving away. There's no constant to be found there as far as I know, and because the deeper we go into this the more my knowledge breaks down, I may well be wrong on that point, but it would definitely not be near the speed of light at micro scales. The expansion is slow, but on a scale of sufficient magnitude, it adds up past the speed of light, galaxies redshifted into invisibility. (Actually, they're still visible past 4.5 gigaparsecs because expansion was decelerating at that time) Of course that dips into relative motion, the galaxies not actually travelling in that respect, as nothing with mass can exceed c. Because the rate is contingent on current distance, and weak at smaller scales, natural forces are easily able to keep up.

The logical consequence being that everything not strongly gravitationally bound right now will eventually recede beyond the observable universe, resulting in a starless sky. This lends to the heat death hypothesis, but that's not really relevant. 

If it seems like I'm moving goalposts to you, I apologize that I haven't made my position clear, but from my perspective I've been talking about the same thing. *Edit:* In the interest of civility, I would like to note that I concede I misunderstood the nature of space-time in my first post.","1409529699"

Put a block of butter, about 50-100 grams in your saucepan depending on how much juice you have and how thick you want it. Let it melt. Once it has melted and heated up, start adding teaspoons of flour while whisking vigorously. When it gets to the point where it's almost too thick to stir, keep stirring it for a minute until it browns (longer if you want more flavour). When it's brown enough for your liking, whisk furiously while dribbling in your sauce slowly. Don't stop stirring it for a second, and by the time all your liquid has been added and boiled it will be starting to thicken. Stir for a couple more minutes and you're done. I use this method with milk and add grated cheddar to make an awesome cheese sauce.","1409529702"

"youtubers","t5_2sj81","Generally, with LP content, you need relatively frequent releases (consistent as well), which is multiple episodes per week (most usually aiming for at least 3 for LP channels, with some specific exceptions to the rules). Also boost your consistency on 'type' of content, if you release 3 episodes per week, probably best to keep it to 1-2 games at the most, if you release daily, you can get away with several games

Another important thing is that you do need to 'market' yourself, get your content up on forums, reddit areas, etc. (without spamming of course, ie only mention it when it's pertinent to the discussion - for example if you made a video covering a piece of information someone's looking for - link it).

Also, while I didn't view a huge sample set (2 videos), I have to say that your voice could use a little bit more pep to it (you're doing ""okay"", but keep practicing raising the energy of your voice, as that will boost engagement... it is possible to go to the other extreme, but it's awkward to explain how to do that properly, and it's honestly more difficult than just developing a basic 'radio voice' or 'youtube voice')

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Yes.

Worst thing is when you point it out, and get a reply 'So you want to FORCE men to be attracted to unattractive women???' as if the only women who deserve basic respect and acknowledgement, and basically to be considered a fellow human being, are women who are attractive to them... so to ask them to acknowledge unattractive women as fellow human beings, they hear 'you must be attracted to these women'. They're happy to give fellow men they're not attracted to this basic respect/acknowledgement as a fellow human being, but not the women they're unattracted to.

They can't fathom considering women as fellow human beings *and* simultaneously considering that woman unattractive. Like they just don't think of it. It's like those things are mutually exclusive a lot of the time to them, that they must find a woman attractive to acknowledge her as a human, her ideas, give basic respect etc.

People say women do it to men too, but I don't think its the same. It definitely happens on some level, but not completely the same. Women might ignore an ugly guy on a romantic level, but she still acknowledges that guy - and ugly guys in general - exist as human beings, even if they reject them romantically or might not even be very nice to them in that rejection. They accept they exist, and that they MAY have something of value to offer even if it's not romantic/sexual (i.e intelligence, are funny, make good friends - these men call that acknowledgement being put in the 'friendzone' sometimes. Women rarely get put in the 'friendzone' by men, but only because an ugly woman wouldn't be acknowledged as a human being with anything of value to offer. Not even friendship. If that man doesn't want to fuck them, that woman is disregarded completely as a person)

Ugly women get outright ignored, as you say, and this 'phenomenon' is usually the reason for the 'It's easy for women to be beautiful! It's easier for women to date men than it is for men to date women!' ideas. Because the people saying those things are completely ignoring the existence - and therefore experiences - of all these conventionally unattractive women. Of which there are many.

[Relevant comment I made a few days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2eenhq/im_giving_up_my_sport_because_im_not_pretty_hot/cjyqv5f)

Should you change it? Well, yeah. You don't have to overdo it, but yeah.. you should change it. In romantic situations you shouldn't stop focusing on the women you want to date or change your dating standards, just acknowledge the existence of ugly women like you'd acknowledge the existence of men you're not attracted to (I'm assuming you're straight here :) ) as friends, co-workers, people who may have good ideas, or be funny, or could support you. Or just.. you know, basic acknowledgement of their existence in a room incase it becomes relevant. Doesn't even have to go any further than that.","1409529704"

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","I had people act like I was a monster when I said I started following Ferber's advice in his book from the moment my baby was born. A lot of people accused me of being a crappy, selfish mama but I did it as much for him as I did it for my husband and I. When he doesn't get enough sleep he is miserable and not his usual self... HE suffers, not just his father and myself. That doesn't mean I let him cry and cry, but I let him have moments to practice falling back asleep on his own, I set a regular bedtime since around 3 weeks and we've always done a bedtime routine with him to practice good sleep hygiene. He will wake up in the middle of the night and fuss a little then roll over and fall back asleep-- very, very rarely will he wake up screaming and there's definitely a big difference. I will ALWAYS go to him if his crying or fussing changes into full blown hysterics that he needs to be comforted through. Letting him ""cry"" through fussy periods has done nothing to make him less loving or sweet towards me and my husband-- when we go into his room in the morning he's usually babbling at his mobile and rolling around holding his feet and cooing and smiling.

I think it's great when a totally no-cry method works for a family, but I don't think the demonization of Dr. Ferber and CIO methods are warranted. Ferber has so much great advice that involves absolutely no crying and he gets passed over because people have heard bad things. A good example was around 2 months my LO kept waking up at 3 am. He wouldn't really eat much and had been sleeping through the night, so I figured out it was habitual waking rather than hunger motivated. For a few days I would go to his nursery before I went to bed around 10 and gently touch him until he stirred (not enough to fully wake him up though)-- this reset his sleep clock and he was able to sleep through the night again. 

Anyway, I'm so happy you and your family found what works for you! ","1409529705"

I was almost done though I just needed one more chapter just one more page and I’ll be done. I’ll be done for good.

The door opened and a young brunette pulled her hand out. I shyly took out my wallet and showed her the card my friend gave me 6 months ago. She smiled and showed me in. The lightening in this place was always horrible and the smell was so much worth, but here I am walking towards the same aisle looking in the same section. Just one more chapter I keep reminding myself. 

As I began to make my way towards the “classics” I couldn't help notice how the computers were always filled. I guess it’s less embarrassing then doing that walk of shame to the aisle of your preference, but at least you don't have to worry about sticky pages while using the computer. But today is the day I’ll be done, no more smell, no more having to explain where I've been, and no more guessing about the end. Just one more chapter. 

I finally have it in my already sweaty hands. I made my way to a table I began to flip through where I left off. “ 153, 153” I kept thinking. 
There was a flash and a ringing. I couldn’t see anything. I only heard shouting. Oh no we're being raided.  People were rushing toward the back exit. I grabbed the book and did the same, but they reached the back. “It couldn’t end like this” I thought. I ran to the shelves. I saw many others on the ground also trying to finish what they started.

You have to improve your communication with him, else you're going to be pissed off and angry all the time.  What's wrong with you asking ""hey dear?  What's your work schedule like this month?  I'd like to be able to plan when we get some time together"".

&gt;I get that he probably didnt want to tell me it all at once, for fear of me reacting or whatever that may be. 

I know you're in a tough place right now, but this is telling.  Have you, and be honest, had angry words with him about the amount of time spent away, or been otherwise unsupportive?  Cause that may well be why he didn't tell you.  He didn't want to deal with irrationality and anger.  

I'm genuinely not trying to be snarky or tear you down.  There is a communication mismatch between the two of you here, and only knowing your side, means that all we can do is advise *you*, and all we can advise is that you talk to him in a calm and rational manner.

Today, storage is so vast and cheap that it's more trouble to delete stuff than to just leave it, and we're building up vast archives of material that may never be looked at again, but chances are anything being aired on TV today will probably still be around somewhere in 20 years, if anyone can figure out how to find it (which is the real trick).

You know what, my friend. Since you clearly are a monument of intelligence I want to tell you this. You know why the United States is the greatest country in the world. Because it allows people like you to live, it allows people like you to criticize, to hate, to complain, and to use the internet. It allows you to feel safe at night. To sleep in that nice bed. It allows you to enjoy the food you eat, and the chair you sit in. the soda you drink. You know why our military budgest is so huge, well one it's not called ""war spending"". The reason it is so large is because we are the stabilizers of the world. We are the military force of nearly 4 whole continents. Our massive military allows Japanese, South Koreans, Vietnamese, Filipinos, and Australians. The security that they won't be attacked an pushed around by a regime like China or North Korea. You benefit from it too.

I imagine you did not read the article I posted. Here let me show you this.

“…the United States has been the creator and sustainer of the current order of open trade and democratic government—an order that has been benign and beneficial for the vast majority of humankind.” The US is the greatest country in the world for many reasons. Because if it were not for the US you'd be living a life of poverty, a life of totalitarianism. You still never told me where you live. 

I love this country because we are protectors of a free world that can build what it wants, trade what it wants, and say what they want. Not because of our own people but what we have done for others. That video did inspire me. You know why? Because it made me realize that the world is free enough to excel in those subjects like education and science. Finland has one of the best education systems in the world, and if it were not for the US and the fact that it uses the NATO card whenever it feels threatened, then it would be a former soviet republic or satellite state similar to Poland. There is a reason why so many countries that were under Soviet rule ran to the US for economic partnership and protection. Because it allowed for so much more freedom.

Can I ask you one question my friend.. What country is the greatest in the world?","1409529714"

"EatCheapAndHealthy","t5_2vvpi","The past couple of weeks, my ""quick lunches"" have been

- Chili (didn't really make me fart more :P)! I make about 4-5 servings at a time, and it's good for a couple of meals that week. It's also EXCELLENT frozen or just put in the fridge. You can reheat on the stove top or in the microwave and it's delicious. Once you have all the staples, the ingredients are very, very simple. Prep time is short. Just chopping an onion and green pepper and chilli, and browning the meat. Most of it is just you letting it simmer or in this case, you have a crockpot. 

- Yogurt with cereal. I use ""QIA"" cereal because it takes up very little space, is healthy, and I only add about a tablespoon or two to keep me full til lunch. It's great as breakfast or lunch because it's filling, tasty and won't make you all tired/sleepy! You can add it to milk as well, and because it's not like a regular cereal it doesn't get mushy, and it's not noisy if you are eating it while you're working. 

- Mixed salad from Costco. Right now my favourite is the ""Super 7"" salad from Costco, that comes with a really good poppyseed dressing and cranberries and sunflower seeds. You can add more stuff to it to fill you up more. I usually just add tomatoes, but it's SO GOOD because even after you add dressing, the salad stays ""crisp"" for a while. It's really good to last throughout the week which is a big deal because I only shop for myself when it comes to food. This is a lot to write about salad but as a non-salad lover, I actually have bought this multiple times because it's a beautiful, fancy salad that's better than many restaurant salads, and is only like $5. If you don't have a Costco membership I know they do sell slightly smaller bags in grocery stores. ","1409529715"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","If you want someone to actually counter your points, here it is.

1) Russia may have had sovereignty over Crimea at one point, but that is the least relevant thing to the discussion. The fact is that Russia sent troops without marking to a place they didn't have sovereignty over, with the only justification being instability in Kiev that wasn't threatening anyone. Even then, the proper response would have been to ask for monitors of the UN's help first, not invade outright. That's a violation of international law.

2) The Ukrainian government was fighting a rebellion in Eastern Ukraine, of which civilian casualties have been an unfortunate part. It hasn't been explained to me properly yet why the nation of Russia somehow has a responsibility to protect Ukrainians and the right to do so unilaterally. That's because they don't, and never have.

3) There have been no reports of ethnic cleansing. That is absolutely made up, but I guess it's all the rage now a days to take a few hundred casualties and scream ""genocide!"" to try and get what you want.

4) The rebels have been shown to be ill trained and poorly disciplined. It doesn't surprise me in the least that the rebellion was failing, even with Russian support. And yes, there is concrete proof of Russian arms in the hands of rebels. Just because they were losing doesn't mean you can deny it.

5) The fact is that Russia, had it gone through the proper process of clearance and permission, could have delivered much more food to the rebels and much more quickly than they actually did. I'm not accusing Russia of shipping something else, because I believe they didn't, but they were acting pretty shady about it and that doesn't help people trust them, especially when it makes them look like they have an ulterior motive.

6) History repeats, but not always in the same fashion. I think it's become clear that this is a limited invasion of Ukraine: just enough to tip the scales but not enough to set off alarm bells. Just because there aren't Russian planes over Kiev doesn't mean that Russia hasn't assumed leadership in the East.","1409529717"

That's a very citrix response though :)

I actually dislike all things citrix (I know I'm the minority here) from sales to support.  I've had citrix support point fingers at each other, I've never experienced that with any other vendor.  I'm also probably soured by our internal citrix team who seems to hold back information and refuses to admit our XML Brokers are setup incorrectly.

We do have a full netacaler environment for certain users, but the brunt of our users needed a better SSL VPN option than what AG could give them.

If our XML brokers were setup in a relatively sound way, we would have the APM front ending it and not need storefront at all, but since our internal guys use ""keywording"" of apps to display to users, we can't leverage XML directly.


I appreciate the responses here, but the issue still stands and the powers that be want this stuff to work.  Appreciate everyone's time thus far.

Edit: yes we are just talking about using an LTM to load balance traffic for storefront.  Not trying to replace any of it.  Although we had better experience when removing as many citrix products as possible, but this goes back to XML being setup to display every app we have to users with no way to filter.

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","I can't speak for the Shamisen, but I was fortunate to find a teacher for the [guzheng](http://youtu.be/ujzMHLac404), the Chinese version of the Japanese koto. I learned it for a year and a bit and from what I can see...

If you want to learn the instrument to master it, you will benefit from being able to read traditional music. Sort of like learning to play the piano without learning music Italian. How will we know whether it's fast or slow? Loud or soft? 

My music book was all in Chinese, including the instructions on technique and so on. The teacher would have to say things, this song is from a tribe where they are happy to have plenty of water etc so this is a water song. Lots of little things that I wouldn't have known if I tried to learn it myself and didn't know Chinese. 

Even if you're trying to do [cover songs](http://youtu.be/YO6sFdoklVU), I would strongly recommend that you try and find a teacher at least for the beginning. Learn the proper finger positioning and methods. I would've just picked up some book off Amazon (there are English shamisen books there too btw) and went for it, but there are lots of little cultural nuances that a book won't be able to convey.

My teacher also said that there are many stores that sell cheap guzhengs, made with cheap materials that won't last and break on me. It's a lot better to have a  pofessional to purchase your instrument. I did flutes last year, and there are so many $50 flutes out there made of soft metals that'll bend out of shape after a year. It's terrible.  I ended up renting a guzheng from my teacher, but I didn't buy one.

I want to leave you the band that made me want to play a shamisen-like insteument: [Ulytau](http://youtu.be/NCfi6W_qhvs) is a band from Kazakhstan that features this instrument: [Erjan Alimbetov - Dombra](http://youtu.be/iH-pzyqjAhM). I love that sound. :)

Pronounced muscle relaxation (yoga is great on any benzos), letting yourself enjoy the mundane like laying on a couch watching daytime television or sitting on the porch outside sipping some water and enjoying the breeze for no real reason or having a conversation about nothing just to pass the time and enjoying the talk without it ever getting awkward or forced.

Just in general being happy with doing nothing and not looking for more than that. Mainly that second one people seem to want the body high of a drug which benzos barely have unless you take a shit ton. I just take them to enjoy some random tuesday night once in a while and know that nothing will get me down and anything or nothing will be fun. Same reason I feel ok taking 10mg of hydrocodone whereas most people take painkillers for that warm blanket whole body orgasm feeling I never chase that high and just enjoy the perfect zen style well being for a little while. I should probably start meditating for the same feeling honestly but never quite know how to start.

I take benzos for the same reason a lot of people trip, they are like a mini-trip in many ways. You just forget about all your worries for the duration. Who doesnt want to forget all their problems for a night every once in a while. Its escapism at its finiest","1409529722"

The ones who think they are helping are the ones we can police though. The biggest part of it is seeing someone in a venue like the one we have here espousing any type of harassment and calling them on it. Just a simple ""Dude, no. That's not cool."" is all it takes sometimes to get someone to rethink what they were planning to do while angry. 

The ones who just want to sling around fire and watch shit burn down we need to ostracize.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","No, it wasn't. Not that my people were here when there actually was slavery, but I live in the deep South in the heart of where it was, and where we are still paying the price.

What people don't understand is that the best and brightest of the slaves escaped the South, as one would expect. 

Many of those (but I'm not saying all, maybe 50/50) that were left to breed for generations aren't exactly rocket surgeons. 

Poor, urban blacks in the North could literally come down to the South and be attorneys, etc. It's obvious how much better the public schools and black culture must be in the North. I say this after spending most of the last decade working in the Northeast. I could speak to kids on the street, where most white people would probably never walk, and would have very well articulated and developed conversations with these young people. Back home, other than the creme of the crop, they are mostly focused on rims and jewelry. Shootings in the clubs are a weekly occurrence.

The South was left with an entitlement subclass, that has been going on for generations. I know that liberals mean well, but the situation down here is truly sad. In NOLA, there are generations of people that have absolutely no desire to work at all. Behind my downtown office, a couple of hours North of NOLA, I constantly hear a group of drunk and cracked out blacks make fun of other blacks who work instead of collecting a check. The ""Great Society"" has trapped and enslaved people to a point where they have little hope and little future. It has absolutely destroyed a great culture.

If anyone reads this, many will say that I am racist. Well, so fucking what? If I am a racist, I am a racist that spent half an hour Friday morning talking with a young black man that actually wanted to work, about where to find a job.

If I am racist, then I am a racist that took a black man to jump off his car two weeks ago, when all of the aforementioned black people behind my office laughed at him as he tried to get home from work.


My point here, is to shine a light on some of the damage that social safety nets have caused in the South. I know that current statistics on welfare abuse don't support my claims. I suspect that the statistics themselves are bullshit. If there was an effective way to detect such statistics, wouldn't there be less welfare fraud to begin with?

There is so much white guilt on Reddit that many subs such as /r/politics are impossible for a moderate or conservative to digest. I just wish for a second, that some of these so called ""progressives"" would take a moment and step back, and realize that all issues are not black and white, as ironic as this might seem.

Land grab must be done fast to be effective. If this is their plan they are definetely doing it wrong. Separatist conflicts last decades and the only thing they ever achieve is destabilizing the region.

The fact is Ukraine is not fighting the Russians (not yet anyway) they are fighting the separatists for all oficial accounts. 
And while this remains an internal Ukranian conflict, the EU has every right to militarily support one of its members and Russia needs to stay out of it's borders.

If Putin later decides to eat his own words and invade, he will be doing something he has already shown he doesn't want, or knows he's not prepared to do. 

Russia is a big country but it's only one, there's no way it can survive as it is today, if it's shut off from the rest of the world. And there's also no way it doesn't break faster.

Their actions right now remind more of the attitude of someone keeping a foot on the door while they're being kicked out. History clearly shows that this is not the position that wins the argument.

If ethnic russians living in Ukraine's borders don't like the new government, that's great. Because last I checked Ukraine is still a democratic state and come next election they can show their discontentment, by acting like every civilized person does, in the ballot box.","1409529733"

 I think the best solution for minimum heatsinks would be to add 1 free heatsink to the 100 rated engine. Instead of 6 steps with 5 engines each, there would be 5 steps with 6 engines each, ending with 245. 2 free heatsinks would also work with 3 steps of 10 engines.

I like the tradeoff between the 240 and the 250 and I don't think the bj needs more tonnage so I would not want the min heatsinks requirement to be removed completely. Even just one more ton would make the missile locusts semi-viable relative to the 1E/3M. As it is, they just can't fit enough ammo.

EDIT: im not sure but i think that might actually make some stock builds under weight in which case its better just to lower the requirement to 9 min heatsinks.","1409529733"

Net spend right now is at £31m by those numbers. Still have £18m in room since up to £49m can be spent under FFP. If Sinclair, Richards, and Guidetti get off-loaded that could be an extra £15m+ in room which would leave £33m to spend on Falcao and still be under FFP rules. Negredo has the force sale of £25m at the end of the loan but that doesn't come in until the end of this season. I don't know how we could pull Falcao right now. He'd go for over £50m, so there'd be at least £17m in overspending under FFP. Unless there could be £33m put down up front and take him on ""loan"" and pay the rest off next season.

"NorthCarolina","t5_2qhmx","&gt; So you're saying if some employers mistreat salaried employees then it's okay for all of them to do so?

This is a false assumption. You accept that you work beyond 40 hours when you take a salary position. That's why it's salaried.

&gt;I also know salaried workers who may be required to work overtime and weekends when necessary, but they get time off to use in the future in exchange for these incidents. I also know salaried engineers who work over 40 hours per week when times are busy, but they are very well compensated on a per hour basis unlike teachers.

That's between them and their employers. I pay taxes, I'm one of their employers.

&gt;People say the 3 months off per year like it's a good thing... it's not 3 months of paid vacation it's 3 months of unpaid leave. Some can work summer school but there are fewer positions available for the summer.

And that's complete bullshit. If you don't work you don't get paid. The average teacher salary in America is $57,000

https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=average%20teacher%20salary%20america

And they don't have to work 3 months out of the year and their benefits hold while they are on summer vacation, not working.

&gt;If they were making good money 3 months of unpaid leave would be great, instead it just cuts into their already low income.

They are. They make more than the average American does per year AND get 3 months off on top of regular benefits.

"rust","t5_2s7lj","In C++11 you can add the `constexpr` keyword to a function to indicate that it can be evaluated a compile time given the parameters are know at compile time.

For example

    constexpr int factorial (const int n)
    {
        return n &gt; 0 ? n * factorial( n - 1 ) : 1;
    }

    int main()
    {
        return factorial(10);
    }

This is just one possible way to optimize away the function. In this case `factorial(10)` will simply be replaced by the computed value.

One could also use C++ templates, which are turning complete, and which will be evaluated at compile time by the compiler


     template &lt;int N&gt;
     struct Factorial
     {
         enum { value = N * Factorial&lt;N-1&gt;::value };
     };

     template &lt;&gt;
     struct Factorial&lt;1&gt;
     {
         enum { value = 1 };
     };

     int main()
     {
         rerturn Factorial&lt;15&gt;::value;
     }

A lot of times however you don't even need to be explicit when programming these things and the compiler will do it automatically. ","1409529744"

But in some cases when you're evaluating a defense, your offense might really blow and hand the ball right back quickly allowing for more possessions and in other cases maybe you have a quick strike offense that leaves your defense out on the field a ton. Lord knows when Mizzou offenses have been at their best historically, our defense has just been left out to dry.

Hell, maybe we look at yards per play and also some stat based on the total opponent offensive possessions because that to me changes everything.

Say some stat line like TD allowed / FG allowed / TOs forced / Total Possessions. That definitely helps give me a way to evaluate a defense rather than just 250 or 350 yards allowed.","1409529744"

The electronics almost certainly need a refresh.  Old power supplies aren't much good and will need new electrolytic capacitors.  You should probably replace all the other capacitors and carbon comp resistors in there, too.

If it were me, I'd restore the electronics (I do that as a hobby) and get it working, then I'd probably use it as a display piece.  I wouldn't play old mono records on it, I'd play those on a modern turntable, which gives better fidelity and is far less likely to damage the records.","1409529748"

"asatru","t5_2r5lh"," What we must keep in mind about Lokasenna is that they are referring to so many lost myths. 

If I understand you right you are referring to this one :
Loki kvað:

        30. 
        ""Þegi þú, Freyja, 
        þik kann ek fullgörva, 
        er-a þér vamma vant: 
        ása ok alfa, 
        er hér inni eru, 
        hverr hefir þinn hór verit."" 



What we also have to keep in mind is the word ""Freyja"" represent the lust in women. It is still being very much bound into icelandic language today (for example flight attendant women are called Flugfreyja(flyingfreyja), housewifes are called Húsfreyja(housefreyja) ) so the word Freyja means something you desire and it has sexism involved with it. 

That is also what he is referring to, it is Freyja's myth. Everyone had lust in her, specially the jötnar. ","1409529751"

Black people are funny to make fun of, and basically dysfunctional in any modern civilization. They aren't worth hating. They cane be good or bad individuals. I guess if you lived around a large number of them, you'd sure hate that.

IGN: NickTheCreator

Past Facs: TeamAquaTrade, Lucky7, Rome, Oblivion, and IceLand

PvP: I don't really know. Maybe a 6-7/10? But I'm always practicing

Mining / Base Work: 9/10 definitely. I'm always in the base harvesting food for everyone. Also making sure there are enough enchanted books so that people have one less thing to worry about. Not a lot of mining this map since my previous faction was close to 1-2 dtr most of the time, but I do mine pretty well.

Communication: I have TeamSpeak and Skype. If another method of communication is needed, it won't be a problem. Just let me know and I'll download it.

Activity: I do have a girlfriend and school started but I am on for a good 4 hours a day. I spend most of that time on HCF if not I'm playing Unturned.

Age: 17

TimeZone: I do live in the Golden State ;) So PST!

Maturity: I'm a pretty chill guy. I like to make conversation with members but know when to shut up when needed.

Overall, I'm just another person who wants to have fun on HCF. I just need a chance and you won't have to worry about me because I will pull my own weight.","1409529752"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","First, don't think similarity is the same as compatibility. You two don't have to like the same things to be in a great relationship. It may be the ultimate cheese, but think about that quote from Jerry Maguire ""You complete me"". It sounds like you two made a great couple and had the patience and communication to get through tough times in the past. What's important is that you make each other happy and you challenge each other as people. 

In my opinion, you might have ended it too soon. I would have at least tested the waters in college instead of ending it just assuming your relationship will crumble. If YOU want to go and experiance different things in college, that's your decision, but don't let society tell you what you have to do in college. The reason people have stupid hook ups is probably the result of a number of different personal issues. Not everyone has them. Just because you're in college doesn't mean you have to go along with that. It's your life. Don't think you're missing out on college life just because youre not a part of the hook up culture. Some people get into relationships the first week of college and remain together for the 4 years of school. I would think that going through this time with your partner would be an exciting time where you can both discover new things about yourselves. And maybe in the end you both come through it together, or maybe you part ways. But hey, at least you gave it a go. But i agree with what one person said. Its not for us to say if it's right or wrong. It's up to you. Just to summarize: It's not all about similarity, listen to you're heart, not society. Good luck. ","1409529755"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","While the hodge podge of powers is a bit odd, the monks don't look to be nearly that bad combat-wise.

Firstly, assuming a slightly liberal take on the use of versatile monk weapons, it's possible to have a starting character with two attacks per turn, +5/1d8+3 &amp; +5/1d4+3, which only human fighters with the dual wielder feat can beat.

The average damage per hit at level 1 for the spear/quaterstaff &amp; kick monk is 7.5 + 5.5 = 13. The specialized dual wielding human fighter gets up to 15, and the great weapon fighter can get to ~11.3 (2d6+3 with the boost of the limited reroll effect). If you don't allow the versatile damage boost, that still means a monk with a d6 weapon is able to use its action and bonus for 12 damage output a turn, and is pretty on-par with anyone else.

A focused point buy wood elf has an AC 16 naked, which is both pretty on point for the fighter, and has extra benefits of minor value.

Compared to the rogue, things get more interesting. Studded leather can get a point buy rogue to 15, and they have the same HP range as the monk. If the monk character devotes hard into Wis, he has a +1 AC. If he instead does something like 16/14/14 for Wis and Con, he matches the Rogue in AC while almost assuredly having an equal or better HP total. The 16/17 Dex Wood Elf Rogue can get access to a d8+d6 damage attack with Sneak Attack through a rapier or longbow (only humans with Weapon Master can outdo this). The twin shortsword rogue can deal 1d6+3 + 1d6 + 1d6 = 13.5 damage for its turn, but it has to reliably get the SA setup and suffers some in defense compared with the Monk.

At level 3, without digging too deep into the options for either class, the monk and rogue differentiate in interesting ways. The monk has roughly 3/encounter abilities to either double the off-hand attacks, Dodge, Disengage, or Dash. Rogues can Disengage, Dash, or Hide for free. However, monks get the free +10' movement, which can obviate some need for the Dash action. A dedicated slasher rogue can potentially out-damage a typical monk. However, this cuts deeply into the Rogue's ability to use its other strengths in combat situations (like Thief or Arcane Trickster bonus actions at 3). Meanwhile, Deflect Missiles helps to cushion the Monk's defensive advantage over the Rogue.

Especially with the Way of the Open Hand, the key factor to looking at the Monk is as a controller-y striker, if I can steal 4E terms. Your damage output is intrinsically strong, and the combination of rising damage dice and ki pools means they can throw out lots of damage at potentially multiple targets, which is just a huge enabler for dealing with mooks. Further, they get these abilities in a package that requires them almost nothing in regard to gear. A great weapon fighter in court or confines is vulnerable, and a rogue mostly needs to hide any of its important tools for the same, but short of death the monk is always able to act at nearly full strength.

I'd love to see someone do the math on higher level stuff, but from the look of their lower level stats and a rough analysis of their scaling in higher levels, I don't see them really being behind others for quite some time, at which point the sheer array of defensive boons covers for most of that. Just getting all saves proficient at 14 solves one of the few big mathematical pain points in this edition, again meaning less magic items required to fill in stat holes and more room for interesting alternatives.

I'm going to be playing a monk with an eye toward WotOH, and I even go to use rolled stats which gave my guy 18s for Dex and Wis. I'll be curious to see how well he does, but I can't see him being that weak at all.","1409529756"

I do have it on PS4 and it looks fine, a little better than GTA V. It does have its' fair share of problems. The driving is clunky and unresponsive, the shooting is boring, and some parts of the story are just downright awful. But there's also a lot I like about it. I like the soundtrack (both the radio songs and the original score), I like the hacking and stealth mechanics, and I also kind of really like the story in a guilty pleasure sort of way. 

Replay value will depend, I personally like to do as much as I can in one playthrough so replay value isn't as for me as it will be for other people.

My biggest gripe with the game is that it feels like it wants to be like Deus Ex, but it there's so many things that stop it from being Deus Ex. It wants be a smart game commenting on the effect social media has on our society and how privacy is affected in a world where everything is connected. It wants to be morally ambiguous and really talk about serious issues facing today's world. But some of the developers don't want it to be that. It feels like one of the devs pitched this idea and a bunch of people (probably the higher ups) kept changing it, trying to turn it into a GTA competitor rather than letting it be its' own thing. I believe there is a legitimately smart, thought provoking and interesting game in Watch Dogs, but Ubisoft missed the mark.

"occult","t5_2qhmc","An excerpt from a blog entry I posted a few months back:

&gt;Satan occupies the position of doubt in the Judeo-Christian paradigm. To westerners**, doubt is the devil! Note that doubt has no paradigm other than an adversarial one. Certainty transcends duality, for without doubt singularity is achieved. It is doubt which generates the seemingly paradoxical experience of duality. Multiplicity is fueled only by doubt. Doubt may as well be a synonym for division. Chaos magic thrives on this. “Nothing/everything is true, everything is permitted”. Or as Austin Osman Spare so bluntly put it: “Does not matter, need not be.” Doubt has no ideological preference. Doubt indiscriminately haunts any who dare choose to think. It simply opposes. If you assume memes to be Arbitrary Units of sentience and follow that thought down the rabbit hole – or get loaded enough – you’ll begin to notice how ideologies are essentially constructs designed to fend off variations of the memetic arch-virus of doubt. All ideologies are plagued by doubt and must constantly create new memetic anti-bodies to fend it off. Or, in the case of cults, cut off as much contact to outside ideas in an effort to prevent infection. Enter cognitive dissonance. Sorry to bear the good news, doubt is built-in. Or as the christians would say: we are born in sin and “the whole world lieth in wickedness”. Indeed the devil dwells within. People leave cults and change religion or become atheists. And even materialists despite having consensus on their side must contend with doubt.

&gt;I personally see no way past doubt except through death. Perhaps beyond there is certainty. So obviously in my magical practice and day-to-day life, I have to find a way to integrate doubt. Otherwise I remain paralyzed by the overwhelming infinitude of possibility. As blissfully terrifying as that experience is, I still need to go to work, write a blog post and cook dinner. And I’d like to enjoy myself with friends without the crippling existential tension thank you very much!

&gt;So then, reality modelling equals reality truncation. How much deflation do I want in order to hit my favored results target? If you have splashed around beyond the shallow end of the occult pool you’ll know that magic which generates results also generates doubt. Take for instance, a ritual designed to manifest spirits. Even long time magicians after performing hundreds of rituals still tend to not conclusively pronounce themselves on the existence/non-existence of “other”. Or if they do express a belief in spirits, their nature is questioned. Those that do speak with dogmatic conviction give off gross vibes and who wants to vibe badly? Ew! And anyway, detoxification of expectation and certainty seems to more reliably generate interesting things. Gordon at runesoup.com provokes thought regarding this. Go read runesoup right away please!

&gt;I move then that all invocations (and possibly all acts of magic), once you get past the different names and flavors of spirits/gods, are invocations of doubt. Same goes for all scientific experiments. They are fundamentally engines for the manufacture of doubt. Any hypothesis or conclusion is accompanied by it’s opposing view. It’s all wrapped in a “pursuit of truth” cloak – remember the anti-bodies? But we’re all inescapably satanic in the end. Whirling certainty-annihilating vortices.

Also, I want to retro-actively preface this by saying, this would be in a perfect paradigm. We can use these ideas and incorporate them with what we have today to create a more fair, sustainable paradigm. It's not an overnight transition, but history seldom is.

I don't think it's anything wrong with him or him not getting enough playing time... my guess would be that he is just genetically that way. I mean, running around for 90 minutes is demanding, realistically not many humans have the natural physical ability to perform.

Isn't it just a form of apartheid?
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; I can understand why some (most?) Muslims implicitly support such a system (the Quran mandates it) but what really boggles my mind is that frequently those who support the Caliphate try to make the argument that non-Muslim would be happy living in such a system. 

It doesn't have a separate set of rules. Non-Muslims are guaranteed equal protection of their rights (life, property, etc.) and protection from foreign invasion in exchange for paying Jizya (which also exempts their men from mandatory military service). In history many non-Muslims preferred Muslim rule (like the Jews in Jerusalem during the Crusades) because it offered them protection.","1409529765"

I'm not calling out Alex, the guy who did it in his video, and I do not want you to go hate on him. But this just proves how bipolar this community is. I still get death threats sent to me because I lava'd myself in a video game, 5 seconds of footage. It's ruined my career in the community. I upload videos of reddit games and it immedietely gets downvoted by people. I go to ask people to team and they no longer want to. I get called a prick, a faggot, a dickhead, everything TO THIS DAY. This video from Dawg has forced me to want to create this message for you all. Do you know how hated I feel? I have quit many random team games because people are being pricks to me about the lava thing, throwing lava buckets at me saying ""Hey shadow, got you something incase you are losing a fight"" and crap. I don't want to play games anymore because of people being horrible to me. It's disgusting. I can't even get into a community, which is nothing to do with UHC, after I put so much damn dedicated into stuff for it and work and try and help them, but the reason I'm not in it, is because of the lava bucket I put on myself in a video game 2 months ago. I'm no longer here for the community, I'm here for the game. People hate me. And I've had enough bullshit from everyone about it, It's fucking ridiculous. I want to get on with my life, even Kac has said he didn't make the video to point me out and say ""hey, go fuck up this kid's online life!"". But thanks for doing that anyways people.

Dean Mayley was stabbed in the heart by Jamal Jones after he refused to hand over his mobile phone in Greenford, west London, on February 7.

The 24-year-old, who had a mental age of nine due to a brain disorder called Microcephaly, probably did not fully understand what the robbers wanted, the Old Bailey heard.

My childhood was kinda shitty with child abuse and what not and I was always made fun of because of my appearance and cause I was gay (even though I wouldn't admit it). Transitioning to high school was also really tough for me. I was also starting new medications and what not for my depression but I thought that they weren't working when in reality I didn't give them enough time to work. So I thought that my life would always be like that. So I got home from school and took a handful of my sleeping pills. I actually woke up and nobody ever knew about it but yeah. I went to therapy and got my meds straight and now I'm better. Not perfect, but better cause I have better coping skills.

But I probably could have phrased the above a little more clearly...

What I was trying to get at, was that *our fascination with wanting to have animals as pets is acceptable - regardless of the animal in question - as long as it won't harm the animal* (obviously, animals with impossibly huge care requirements would be irresponsible to adopt as pets) - because God designed things that way, designed us to want that, to begin with. People who say ""nooo, the wild should be left in the wild"" (notwithstanding not feeding wild things, as noted above) or ""that's horrible, that animal's all cooped up in a house like that...!"" hasn't properly connected with this reality/fact.

"haskell","t5_2qh36","&gt; Haskell doesn't go this route, for the sake of GC and lazyness, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

I disagree on laziness: GHC does a lot of work to remove unnecessary laziness where possible.

&gt; It costs some overhead - just compare size of compiled program which prints ""Hello world"" written in various languages.

That's a bad benchmark, because most of the size of that program depends on the size of setup libraries and on what linkers do (you can get very different sizes across C compilers or across GCC ports).

&gt; With better knowledge about the problem, human can write more optimal code in lower-level language like C, than compiler of higher-level language would be able to produce.

Of course so, given unbounded time for smart and knowledgeable humans. But good optimizers (or, more often, program generators) producing comparable or faster than hand-tuned code is not something completely unheard of, though often you need to teach the compiler more about your problem domain.

It doesn't matter; everyone is welcome and I've never heard of anyone not having a good time.

And so I ask... What have you done to connect with these people on a level that isn't just work?

I think it works by basically just blowing air out around the propellers, which makes a less distinct sonar trace than without. They also push air out around machinery spaces, which masks the machinery noise. It sounds like it would just make a warship louder/more obvious, but it actually does a fair job of ""masking"" the specific warship noises, and will force a sub to PD to verify what they're trying to shoot at/classify.

[HERE'S](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/search?q=music&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all) a search of all of the posts - you might get some ideas from that.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Not an answer to your question, but I teach students who are already convicted felons. Some fit the category of violent offenders. Formerly, I worked as a lawyer, a decent bit of criminal defense.

For the most part, my students are pretty much normal teenagers. I think the biggest and most notable difference is low empathy. I have very little empathy myself, so I try to be attuned to that. As a for instance, last year a co-teacher had a former student from a former job die in a car accident (prom). He couldn't take time off to go to the funeral and had to teach. It just so happened that our students were being especially shitty that day and the teacher was at a breaking point. He opted to share with them what wad going on in his personal life and could they ""just keep it a little normal today."" Of course, the class erupted in laughter. 

What interests me right now is the growing research into sociopathy and pro-social sociopathy (James Fallon is who I have most recently seen speak on the issue). Also this notion that there may be a ""guilt switch."" Many of my students are incredibly charming, but couldn't care less about their peers. Really, really, really couldn't care less.

Also interesting to me, a recent study I read discusses how punishment is even less of a deterrent for those with sociopathic tendencies (I chuckled when I read it because my own parents have told me that a hundred times); however, rewards do tend to yield behavioral changes, if only temporary.

Anyhow... my students are already felons, so they don't really fit, but without having extended time with them, there are no real clues that they are murderers and rapists.

As an aside, we do have a special few that it is abundantly clear... but they are processed very quickly and end up in psychiatric.","1409529782"

yes i agree about WoW but i am really not sure where you are drawing these conclusions from about Destiny and what the raids will be like. its probably just a difference of expectations and i am yet to buy into raids being so hardcore that the majority cannot do them. 

I played against the AI in the beta and unless they are 3-4 times better, its not going to dramatically change encounters in a scripted raid.  UNless they say its unscripted it will be segmented with certain spawns at certain points.  

Use X supers for this phase, X class be ready for this.  

I am talking about after completing the raid 20+ times at least here where it will just become another mission to run.

I guess jump puzzles will be the real issue.  oh jump puzzles, the corner stone of all fps raiding lol.

Yeah, the issue it is that the genocide is so intensely political for all the wrong reasons. Armenia tries to use it as leverage in everything and Turkey hates Armenia for other reasons than the genocide currently, so why give them leverage?

He did last IamA

&gt; This goes back to hard-points in history that I figured everyone knew. I personally assume everyone acknowledges that the Holocaust happened so I'm always surprised (and disgusted) when some people claim it never happened.

That one I can totally agree with you on, while there are a ton of pragmatic reasons why Turkey might want to deny the genocide (while still fucked up) there is nothing pragmatic about denying the holocaust. ","1409529792"

No. They may not have known exactly how dangerous the building was or the exact mechanism of mechanical failure likely to take place, but they knew it was deemed illegal to be bought, which should have clued them in that they shouldn't buy it. This clue should at least lead to further investigation before they chose to make the risk. 

If, after having gotten more information, they still choose to buy the building, that's on them. If, on the other hand, they chose not to seek more information and just dive in, that's negligence, also on them. Even if they had zero information at all and somehow lack the sense to wonder in any measure what they were putting into their bodies, ignorance is not an excuse for breaking the law.

In Arena Commander, you are in a space ship limited with limited speed. There is no reason why your spaceship can't go faster than 200 m/s or whatever its top speed may be... that is simply there to make the game fun.

There is no fuel use to consider; all the maneuvering and such will take far more fuel than accelerating to a higher speed in a single direction.

If it were a function not wanting to hit things, then it would depend on your direction and distance from objects. But it's not.

It's not based on any physical parameters. It's the speed at which the Star Citizen team determined would be most fun to play at. Chris Roberts has even said this numerous times.","1409529795"

&gt;__Prairie/Masker__ is a radiated noise reduction system fitted to some warships of western origin, including the [DD-963](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Spruance_(DD-963\)) and [DDG-51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DDG-51)-class destroyers and the [CG-47](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CG-47)-class cruisers.

&gt;The __Masker__ portion consists of two bands fitted to the outside of the hull adjacent the vessel's engine rooms, compressed air is then forced into the bands and escapes through machined perforations to create a barrier of air bubbles in the sea about the hull, thus trapping machinery noise. __Prairie__ works via the same principles but is fitted either near to or on the ships propellors. The systems are designed to prevent classification/identification by radiated noise of the warship in question by acoustical analysis, i.e. by a hostile submarine. Instead of hearing machinery, the ship sounds similar to rain on [passive sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passive_sonar). Originally classified, these systems are now used by several countries as part of their [anti-submarine warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare) solutions.

&gt;The masker portion of the system is based upon creating a speed of sound (acoustic impedance) mismatch between the bubble curtain and the seawater. Acoustic waves encountering material with a radically different speed of sound do not penetrate, but bounce back. The speed of sound is dependent upon the square root of stiffness of a material divided by its density. In a bubble cloud the density is mostly unchanged - that of the water - but the stiffness is that of air. The result is that the speed of sound in a cloud of bubbles in water is a factor of almost ten slower than in water itself and a factor of three slower than it is in air. Thus, sounds within the ship (or submarine) hull which would otherwise go out into the water and propagate for a long distance are reflected back into the hull and eventually dissipated therein. You can experience one manifestation of this physics by filling a glass with water and with carbonated water and tapping the side with a spoon. The water-filled vessel will ring. The vessel with bubbles in it will 'thud.' (Thanks to Alan Ellinthorpe, a navy acoustician, for this experiment.)

During war the tribal instincts will take over, the other guys will become the enemies that must be destroyed because they threaten the very existence of humanity etc.

Painting the other guys as inhuman/monsters/sub-human etc makes soldiers not look at them as just another person, another guy, and makes it easier for soldiers to kill those enemies. I guess it tricks the brain into giving it just enough of an excuse to turn you into a murderous bastard.

And then if the other guys kill or maim a friend or relative, you won't fight for country or president or noble ideals. You'll fight because it's personal. You'll personally hate the other guys (even if the one who killed that friend has nothing to do with the guy you're shooting at) and want to exact revenge.","1409529797"

So, technically, the Predator couldn't possibly be seeing in IR, but instead some kind of avant garde rotoscoping that only vaguely resembles heat patterns. So I think we should give this action figure a pass on that score.

I ask because, if it is only the one thing, it may be worth approaching her to hash it out. However, if it isn't just this one thing, approaching her might backfire in that you find out many more negative opinions than you want to know. 

In the latter case, better to just get on with life. MIL t-be may soften up again in time. The fact that she hasn't confronted you and still treats you well says good things. 

As much as it sucks to be known as 'the thief', it isn't the end of the world. You could be, 'that drug dealing crackwhore' for example. As you said, thief can be matured out of. Drug dealin' crackwhore takes a whole lot more than time, you know?

The only reason they are even so overwhelmingly hostile to outsiders is because they're indigenous to Tatooine; they, like most native cultures, haven't taken to kindly to (galactic) imperialism.

2: Honestly, and I know I might get flak from some people for this: I didn't find it that hard. I still had friends (albeit not at school), still went to school, still had access to computers and such through the library (where I spent a *ton* of time, I've read thousands of books). To me it was just normal. I was pretty fortunate because my dad made sure I could eat.

3: Oh, man. That's a hard one. Not too many incredibly happy memories, haha, but there are a few. I met my friend Jack about 2 weeks after I left home. Those first two weeks were the roughest, for sure. But, Jack sort of showed me the ropes. He told me about getting a gym membership, pushed me to stay in school, kept telling me over and over again that our situation was only going to be permanent if we wanted it to be. He's been my best friend for 10 years now, and I don't see that ever changing. We were there for each other always, and steadily crawled up the ladder of society together. From the streets to a small apartment, to a house, to our own apartments, and now we each own our own houses. 

Just meeting him and having that kind of support is one of the greatest things ever.

This change in acceleration being called a jerk I think must have started and stopped, so doesn't that mean it changed over time, and so on, etc?

I'll concede that similar ideas expressed in other ways have existed (if you want to count classcal liberal as similar enough) but the fact of the matter is ancapism starts with Rothbard in terms of fully fleshing out and defining the philosophical underpinnings and the institutions which evolve from them.

Has anyone noticed that it seems impossible to actually damage AI tanks with it, though? I've not killed one, and I try every time I go out. Medium and heavy tanks seem completely immune to it, though since the PBJ doesn't get into games with light tanks I can't say what it'd do to them.

If we could kill tanks, and if standard (non-light) pillboxes, warships, and cargo ships had weak points, we'd have a lot more to shoot at with the cannon. As it is, .50 cals are more effective at killing everything that the 75mm can, which seems silly...","1409529802"

&gt; Searches identified 2,675 publications describing the effects of male circumcision on aspects of male sexual function, sensitivity, sensation, or satisfaction. Of these, 36 met our inclusion criteria of containing original data. Those studies reported a total of 40,473 men, including 19,542 uncircumcised and 20,931 circumcised. Rated by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network grading system, 2 were 1++ (high quality randomized controlled trials) and 34 were case-control or cohort studies (11 high quality: 2++; 10 well-conducted: 2+; 13 low quality: 2-). The 1++, 2++, and 2+ studies uniformly found that circumcision had no overall adverse effect on penile sensitivity, sexual arousal, sexual sensation, erectile function, premature ejaculation, ejaculatory latency, orgasm difficulties, sexual satisfaction, pleasure, or pain during penetration. Support for these conclusions was provided by a meta-analysis. Impairment in one or more parameters was reported in 10 of the 13 studies rated as 2-. These lower-quality studies contained flaws in study design (11), selection of cases and/or controls (5), statistical analysis (4), and/or data interpretation (6); five had multiple problems.

&gt; The highest-quality studies suggest that medical male circumcision has no adverse effect on sexual function, sensitivity, sexual sensation, or satisfaction.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","&gt;So remember never let anyone tell you have no points so you must not be doing anything while you may be playing mind games with the other team. Points do not matter in TF2 its about helping your team. 

If you're the team's third or fourth spy this is actually a valid complaint and people should be getting annoyed at you, because chances are in that situation you're hurting your team more than helping it. Under other circumstances, though, yes this is true.

Also, probably the best piece of advice I can give a Spy is don't go super far behind the enemy lines and go for picks on enemies who aren't actually doing anything unless you can get them right out of spawn or they're just oblivious (this is as a general rule, though sometimes it works out for the better). The best thing you can do is go for picks on enemies that are engaged with your team; they're distracted and you can save your team a lot of headaches. 

Likewise, going through the effort to take down an engie nest when your team has no offensive presence isn't usually worth your time unless you're confident you and your team can keep it down, since it only takes about a minute to set it up again. 

However, the most important thing about playing Spy? Know when it's time to switch. If you've been playing awhile and you're not accomplishing anything, sometimes it's better to just take a different role. Also, if there are three other Spies on your team, DO NOT PLAY SPY. You'll just be a total waste of a team slot and you're screwing your team over. Not to mention, you won't get any stabs because the whole team will be on alert the whole time.

TL;DR Attack distracted enemies and key enemies blocking a push, and don't be that asshole who joins team and goes spy no matter how many there already are.","1409529806"

If it makes sense to use them because they encapsulate some logic (like input validation) then by all means use them to have DRY code (Don't Repeat Yourself).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

"LetsNotMeet","t5_2t3t8","It's possible that your Ex has made you a hobby, and her friends are following along with her on a lark. 
As others have suggested, a restraining order is probably in order here. The two problems with this approach are that a restraining order is just a piece of paper, and you are dealing with multiple people. I would still highly suggest getting one, as one step in the process. 
You should document every instance of seeing her. Take pictures, take video, set your camera to display a time/date/location stamp, record audio, and keep a journal of strange knocks at the door/phone calls/stuff.
Get a security system. A monitored security system. Get security cameras. Put them everywhere. Review the footage regularly.
The results of this documentation should be archived, printed or saved and shown to the police. It will help you to get that restraining order, help law enforcement to identify others that are working with her, and might help reassure you that you are not insane. In circumstances like this, sometimes some reassurance is a good thing. 
Heck, publish the pics and video on the internet. See how they like being exposed to the whole world.
Another good and reassuring thing to have would be a weapon. Arm up. Get a gun, big knife, sword, heavy cane, sharp stick, big rock, harsh language, something, and learn how to use it. Get training. Professional training. Take a self defense class, take training in some martial art. Show your instructor the evidence you have collected to prove to him that you are being stalked and allow him to tailor your instruction accordingly. 
Get a gun safe and bolt it to a wall. Get professional firearms instruction. At the very least, go buy a nice big can of pepper gas and a baseball bat. If they are going to hurt you, at least make them work for it. 
If her friends are less serious about this stalking thing than your ex, coming up against resistance, like being named in a domestic violence restraining order or having pictures connecting them to a stalking cult published where employers and families could see them could take the fun right out of being a stalker, not to mention that it's a lot less fun to aggravate someone who is willing and able to defend themselves physically. 
Eventually, you will record or otherwise capture evidence of them 
doing something illegal enough to attract the interest of law enforcement, and get one or many of them in real trouble.
Even if you only record one of them breaking the law, the rest might be in line to be charged with criminal conspiracy. 
The one caught could fold under questioning, turning the others in. You just have to let them give you enough rope to hang them with.","1409529811"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","It happens more than you realize. My dad moved out of our house and in with a ""friend"" when I was 16. It was months before he admitted that his friend was really his girlfriend.

I assume it was hard for him to come right out and tell his kids that he was leaving his family for the woman he was having an affair with.

I found out about the wedding a few weeks after it happened. He told me they were going for a golf weekend in Hilton Head. Found out that they got married a few weeks after they got back. My brother and I weren't invited.

I think my dad had a really hard time seeing himself as the bad guy - the type of guy that would break up his family and not be a great dad. I'm in my 40's now, and we've had exactly 1 conversation where he admitted that his leaving was probably not the best thing to do to me and my brother. I think seeing my brother and I at his wedding was just more than he could handle, just too much of a reminder of the damage he caused to other people. So he just avoided telling us about it altogether.

Divorce sucks and I'm sorry you're going through this. If it makes you feel any better, I've been there and know what you're going through.

But, even if they did, it would not make them credible,   
as official turkish sources can't be trusted to be unbiased.    
Since the Turkish government is sustaining a policy of genocide denial,  
no 'official' source would be allowed to voice the truth.

I've used all of the programs I listed, and at the time that I was last regularly using them, I would consider myself a beginner/novice with 6 credit hours of college coursework when i was a senior in high school, and architectural and mechanical work experience for a local architectural firm. It's been about 4 years since I touched any of it, as i went into engineering instead of architecture or animation of some sort, but this is not commercial-grade modeling. there is no texturing of the working elements, or alternative gloss/matte options. The material application to the models themselves is quite shoddy, but I wasn't going to harsh on that the first time through. look at the floor and tires... what is this, a PS1 game? Standards have risen in the last 12 years. 

I'm not saying that any of those things will make it an un-fun game experience, but this is certainly not something worth flaunting if you're looking for backing of your game. Games with visuals like this are forgiven in return for supplying fun and satisfying mechanics. So show that instead. There is nothing to see here. That model is a high-school CAD class portfolio level of finish. 

Show us the physics, because if this is the same game that I remember seeing something about a while back, that actually has some merit. **IF** it's the same game, then it's got the best I've seen in the genre so far.

examples of my own hobbiest works from high school-
[this](http://imgur.com/qX3AGBG) is *one* picture from one room of a house that I had to design entirely, then do hand-modeling, texturing, lighting, and rendering of that I had a total of 5 hours to complete for a class.

[this](http://i.imgur.com/1NTSILN.png) is another one of a few renderings of a particular model that I made for a 3 hour project.

this one is another architectural [render](http://i.imgur.com/QRNr7bZ.png) for a wild-west themed project. total time to point of render is about 4.5 hours of modeling, 2 hours tweaking material surface properties

And if she'd had the energy to go out and buy and prepare her own food, she wouldn't have been relying on me to do it. (I mean, I'm a pretty good cook now, but it's an acquired skill.) And she thought she was allergic to just about everything (undiagnosed celiac can really fuck with your head) so eating out/ordering in wasn't really an option. So I'm fairly sure I had a good idea of what she was eating.

We actually had really great eating habits when I was little. Everything was homecooked, lots of veggies and lean meats, small portions of rice or potatoes, no frozen food, no boxed meals, all very traditional and from-scratch, often bought directly from local farms. That's how I learned to cook. She was on the slightly chubby side of normal in my baby/toddler pictures; she has shoulders like a linebacker and a large chest and a penchant for boxy T-shirts, so it's hard to tell exactly what her body shape was, but she looked healthy.

She started losing her appetite and being fatigued all the time around the time I started third grade, and then she started gaining weight. There was never a point where she just sat around eating a lot; she ate less and less and weighed more and more. If it hadn't been for the appetite loss and the celiac she might have turned into a hambeast. And it really was entirely the thyroid.

"russia","t5_2qh75","&gt; The conclusion we agreed upon was that use of such weapons would be seen as so egregious that a full scale nuclear response would be used.

Seen by whom? Did you really decide that the top political and military brass would be so freaked out by the use of tactical nukes that they'll launch the global holocaust in response?

&gt; But the problem with this is it is all speculation

That's exactly right. The problem is that most of the time people speculate along the most extreme lines. In reality, WWI happened and the mechanics of its start have been drilled into every military commander's head ever since its end. We also have a very long history of armed conflicts involving major nuclear powers, and that history instructs the current generation of policy and decision makers. 

In effect, nuclear weapons won't be used, but not because tactical nukes will automatically lead to strategic ones. They won't be used because no one will ever allow the situation to develop to the point where either side would have reasons to use tactical nukes in the first place. That's why the US and Russia traditionally settle their differences by beating up each other's stooges but never engage each other directly.","1409529822"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","&gt; All of the athletes who injured their backs were performing one or more of the following lifts: the power clean, the clean and jerk, the squat lift, or the dead lift.

I would guess that this has more to do with bad training. I know this is completely anecdotal, but the kids on the high school football team were never taught how to lift correctly. They were taught that squatting below parallel was dangerous and almost exclusively did box squats. Another anecdote: I've seen quite a few kids with football backgrounds that perform the power clean by starting in incorrect position, reverse curling the bar to their chest, overextending their backs and catching the bar in this overextended position with their forearms upright, instead of in a rack position.

Really, how many coaches take the time to stress mobility and correct form before loading kids up with heavy weight? How often do you see kids (and adults) in the gym doing partial squads with a bar with more weight than they can adequately stabalize? How many do you see trainees that will round their lumbar spine on deadlifts and grind the weight up by resting it on their thighs? To me, it seems more likely that incorrect form and bad teaching leads to these injuries, than the training itself being the cause. Let's also not discount the culture of adolescent sports coaching in which many coaches find it acceptable to push these kids right up to and sometimes past their breaking point.","1409529825"

You aren't a skilled player if you change gear midfight it just means your opponent is an idiot and would probably let you use great heal too without punishing it.

Equipping multiple weapons and utilizing all 3 slots increases weight as well and that alone penalizes you by slowing stamina regen.

Min-maxing is for tools and thats one reason why Dark Souls 1 pvp was never that great. If you blame your loss on stats or its because your build isn't good enough then you're just not good. If you lose its your own skills to blame as well as the skills of your opponent.

You shouldn't have to fight at a disadvantage because your pre-decided unchangeable build runs into a build that hard counters it.

After accepting my current position I've been offered a few other jobs so you also have to realize that it can take a while for your application to reach HR.  This is especially true for large companies who mass hire a couple times each year, for example aflac wanted to hire me in February but didn't have training again until recently (one of my call backs after starting my new job). 

Just keep doing your thing and it'll work it if you keep trying.  And I can't stress this enough, CALL THE HR DEPARTMENT AND THEY WILL INTERVIEW YOU IF THE POSITION ISN'T FILLED! Even if you aren't qualified they might have other positions open as a starting point in their company. If you nail the interview then you might get the position anyway, so you really can't lose by calling them.

I had gotten into crafting and farming, and it had been a few days since I had left the base, and generally safe from the hoardes on the lake, I ignored them. I'm crafting away one day, and the whole side my house was on collapses to the lake level. from what I can tell the hoardes had managed to pretty cleanly chew through the base of the mesa, and the whole thing started to collapse.

 So I lost it all due to me being too lazy to go and check on the damage they'd done. Since then trunk tips and regular checks of the base of my structures have been higher on the priority list.","1409529833"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I used to teach 8th grade special education in an inner city school. One of my brightest students (I'll call him Shawn) came from a rough home. No father at home, mom was a drug addict. he lived with an aunt who worked hard to keep him on the right track and I threw my lot in with her to try to help this kid in every way because I thought he had a shot at making it out. In addition to be smart he was tall, gregarious, and handsome. One day, he brought a large wrench to school and was turned in by another student (apparently they use them to break bicycle locks &amp; steal them). He asked me to back him up and say it wasn't him, but I'd seen the principal take it from him when they called him into the office asked him to empty his pockets. I vouched for what a good kid he was, but he still got suspended for 5 days (how dumb is it to suspend students who don't want to be in school in the first place and come from troubled neighborhood, school for many of them is their haven). I argued against it but it was district policy. Shawn decided to blame me for his suspension. Two days later, the tires on my car were slashed in the school parking lot. The afternoon after that I was standing outside for bus duty and Shawn drives by the school parking lot in a known gang car, sitting in the front passenger seat. He leans out and mimics firing an automatic weapon at me as the car rolls by. Several other teachers and students see this happening and dove for cover, I stupidly stood there watching him in disbelief. I was placed under police protection for the rest of the school year (no more outside bus duty!). A few years later I read in the paper he'd been arrested for a triple gang murder. Still makes me sad to this day, to think about what he could have become.

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","&gt; The new beats solo 2's are supposedly v good.

I got the chance to try these out in Best Buy. IMO they are the first Beats headphones that aren't crap. 

The lows don't completely blow out the minds, the highs aren't piercing, and overall the sound quality isn't too bad for a $200 on ear headphone. Sound staging, imaging, and detail retrial is pretty bad, but that's to be expected. 

So, to the OP; if she wants Beats, guide her towards the Solo^2.  

Edit: When I say ""Sound staging, imaging, and detail retrial is pretty bad"" I'm coming from kilo-buck+ setups so YMMV. I don't want to sound overly negative or positive, but I was quite surprised with the bump in sound quality. 

Edit 2: I still find the M100 to be the better can, and there are several other cans mentioned that do sound better. However, they might cost a bit more than Beats; especially in Denmark. ","1409529839"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Because the games weren't designed with touch screen in mind. They are games that are made with button *forcibly* ported to touch screens. Yeah they can play with the interface a little and try to make it a little more bearable, but games made for touch screens and buttons are just fundamentally different. 

As a result, you get a less than optimal experience with buttons taking up half of the screen and not having optimal button feedback. Obviously touch screen has its strengths and games that are designed with this in mind are wonderful (Plants vs Zombies, Angry Birds etcetc.).

But RPGs that require 4 directional movement and exact button inputs are absolutely atrocious on touch screens IMO.

So the ""core"" gamers that prefer games on well...handheld consoles actually *made* to play games will want to play it on that. I personally would never buy something like final fantasy on a mobile device, it would have to be on a handheld console.

$37.50 is not a lot, although 15k is a tiny amount of your portfolio.  If you put the entire $120k, betterment would charge 0.15%, which would come out to be $180 per year.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","I said it before the change, I've said it since, and I'll say it again here.

The mass change is quite simply the worst change they have ever come up with for wormholes. Previously if I'm a small 10-15 man corp, with around 6-7 guys online and there was a large corp on the other side of my wormhole, I could wait for a bit, scout for a bit and then rage collapse the hole and hope that I got it shut before their fleet showed up. This put 2 Orcas and a Carrier (or an orca/BS and a dread) at risk to shut that hole, because I thought I had a good chance of shutting it without loss (or with minimal loss) and then being able to do something in my new chain or home system.

After the change if there's a larger corp on the other side of that hole I'm just going to log off. I can't fight 30 dudes with 7 and I can't shut the hole. If I try to shut the hole I'm going to lose all the ships I used in the attempt. No ships in space, no risk of conflict, just blue balls everywhere.

This change that was aimed at shaking things up and creating more fights has failed massively. Instead of having some fights, we now have no fights.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","After clearing my head from that game. I am happy Curse is not going to Worlds. They are clearly not ready and would misrepresent North America where it matters most. I am glad that LMQ showed the World that they are the stronger team.  It was an amazing 5 game set, very intense and a lot of chair standing moments. Am I sad that Curse isn’t going to Worlds? Of course I am. Anyone would be sad that their team is not the best. Curse lost that third game in Champion Select. They also lost the 3 games vs C9 yesterday ALL in Champion Select. Curse do not know how to Pick Ban correctly. They do not know what’s priority over comfort or what’s comfort over counter. Just because Akali counters Yasuo doesn’t mean you will win the game. It means you might win your lane, depending on how you play. I do not know why Voyboy locked in Akali after seeing the LMQ’s team comp.  LMQ was really tanky, had a LOT of CC, a LOT of AOE, and had multiple abilities that can give vision. And you don’t really pick a niche pick like that when its everything on the line. However, this was not only Voyboy’s fault.  In the 3rd game, LMQ got first pick and snagged, Braum. That’s ok. Why did Curse take Lulu and Lucian first when Yasuo and Mao’Kai and Ryze and Kha’Zix were open? No one knows. It’s the little mistakes like these that can cost you a trip to the World Championship. Why would you run such a squishy front line when you have a Lulu top and a support Morgana? Let alone an Akali mid and Jungle Elise? Nonetheless, I am very happy for LMQ, they really deserved the win today. They played flawlessly after those first 2 games. Absolutely dominating performance, and I cannot wait to see what they have to offer at Worlds. Pretty amazing seeing a team go from Challenger to Number 3 spot in North America and a trip to Worlds. Very proud of them. As for Curse, I will always be a Curse fan, through thick and thin. Little bumps in the road doesn’t mean that you leave your team for a better team. You give them your full support cause its times like these they need you the most. GG WP to LMQ! And hope they can do their best at Worlds. Thank you all.","1409529850"

Gambling is a fun and sensory experience, but once it starts crossing the line into hurting finances and relationships, its a problem.

$2000 a month, or $48,000 a year, on a ""hobby"" is extremely excessive. Gambling is also an escalating addiction, he will gamble more and more to get his ""high"". I should know, I am guilty of enjoying the casino to the tune of a good amount of money, but only on particular occasions, and always with a budget. He seems out of control... do you have combined finances? If no, you dont have much say in how he spends his cash, but you do have a say in how this effects your relationship. 

Sit him down and explain how you feel. Highlight the amount of money he is spending and explain how he makes you feel second to the casino. He is exhibiting the very beginnings of a classic gambling addiction, and you want him to get help. If he chooses not to, I suggest you leave. Like it or not, in a long term relationship, money issues are extremely important and if he acts like this now, just imagine what will happen if you get married, try to buy a home, have children, or anything else financially draining. If he can't be responsible with money, he may not be the best of choices for a life partner.  Be thankful you saw this before it was too late.","1409529850"

It seems all too hip these days to talk about how you ""hate people"". You hate people? All people? Even the highly intelligent, attractive, charming, accepting, open-minded ones?

C'mon, people. Sure, lots of people are Grade A Ass Hats and are capable of the purest forms of depravity. But, but, buuuutttt... There is an entire world of wonderful people just waiting to engage, grow, and love YOU.

I am possessive of my feelings. I used to LOVE to hold onto my anger, hate, condescension for others. But, then I was like, ""Why, dude?""

Hate for others, in my experience, is bred from a lack of love of self; from an uneasiness with who we are as people. I don't have it all figured out, man, but everyday I am presented with the chance to make positive, loving, mind-expanding choices that bring me closer to the tangent line of my perfect self.

Maybe I'm going overboard with this, I just hear this cliche too often.

This actually brings up other questions.  Would the continents look the same?  Would the 6 continents just become 763.6 times bigger or would there be countless new continents.  If so would there be a much bigger percentage of uninhabitable land due to water, both for drinking and travel?

That just raises more questions.  Would humanity have progressed as quickly being more spread out.  If the oceans were 763.6 times larger how long would it have taken man to cross them?  It took Columbus 10 weeks to cross the Atlantic.  That would be 7636 weeks or 146.8 years.  It would have taken generations.

"Luthier","t5_2rxqu","1) You need to be sure the saddle height of the old bridge is close to the saddle height of the new one. This is because Gibson-style bridges (like the one on there now) are higher than Fender-style bridges and the neck is angled away from the body to compensate for that. If that's the case, you'll have to remove shims or sand the neck down for a proper fit (I'm assuming it's a bolt-on). 2) The scale length might be thrown off if the new bridge's pickup hole isn't the correct distance from the bridge saddles. In that case, you'd have to move the pickup, not the bridge. 

I suspect the new bridge might not be a good fit for this guitar. Even if the above concerns are addressed, it's hard to make a pick guard trim look good. So you may have to order a custom cut pick guard. If you don't know exactly what you're doing, take it to a repair shop and ask them to do it for you. ","1409529855"

"mining","t5_2rlp4","This is called a cross pit spreader. This one is particularly massive and I'm pretty interested in knowing where it is, but you can find general information on them [here](http://www.miningandconstruction.sandvik.com/SANDVIK/8990/S003114.nsf/Alldocs/Products*5CBulk*materials*handling*equipment*5CSpreaders*2ASP*1200*2F35*2B50/$file/Brochure_Homepage_open%20pit%20mining.pdf) and [here](http://www.takraf.com/en/Products/Mining_Equipments/spreader.htm). My understanding of it (limited) is that they require pretty decent and specific conditions (the right height, flat seams, stable geology) and you still have to follow up with some truck/shovel to get the last little bit so you don't waste coal.

On the CC cream: The smooth, creamy texture, ""blurred"" finish, medium-high coverage, physical sunscreen, all-day lasting power, etc. are all amazing, and it's also the only BB/CC cream I've ever found that's a good color match for me (I have neutral olive skin, and the ""light"" shade has strong yellow tones that make it a great fit). However, it's somewhat dewier than I would prefer - I always feel super shiny after I put it on, and have to tamp it down with finishing powders.

Peter Heylin's argument was that the term was used by some ancient writers, and that Tacticus considered the Irish and British inhabitants similar.

Scholarly opinion is that Heylin politicised his writings, and  ""demonstrated their authors' specific political identities by the languages and arguments they deployed.""

Common usage of the term didn't come until much later, after the act of union, when Irish nationalism began to gain momentum (arguably that happened earlier given the 1798 rebellion).

Added to this we have the fact that term doesn't even cover the archipelago it seems to refer to, as it includes the channel islands.

To stick your fingers in your ears and pretend that the term is politically free and simply a geographical location is as ignorant as to think that Macedonia (the country) is a value geographical term.","1409529857"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I honestly believed a large part of what caused me to feel like there was no other option was the anti-seizure medication I was on. Also, I was struggling with generalised anxiety disorder (did not find that out afterwards) which got so bad it spiralled into depression. At any mention of my feeling depressed to my parents they played it off as hormones and teenage angst not mental illness. The short answer is I thought there was no other way to stop feeling shit and that the world was better off without me. My brain chemicals were seriously messed up. Changing anti-seizure medication did help my mood quite a bit.

I don't think I really got help until a few years later, simply transferred my pain into other self destructive and reckless activities such as an eating disorder and taking prescription drugs. When I moved out of home to university noticed how supremely fucked up I was and how I deserved actual mental health treatment. So now here I am. Anti-depressants made me feel normal again. Like a veil of fog had lifted. I have learned some coping strageties for anxiety that people my age who have never had any issues don't even know. Which is pretty neat!

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","The akali pick wasn't the issue - the build was. Since akali was often solo diving and in turn being super focused, voy really needed to go for the rylais as a first item. Zhonyas takes too long to complete if you aren't super snowballing; he didn't even have it finished by end game. Akali doesn't have the safety that most of the other mid assassins have since pink just shuts her down so you have to be able to soak at least some damage. Another thing that most Akali players dont seem to acknowledge is that her base damage from a full rotation (using 3 ults on a champion but timing them where you can Q before jumping again) is stupid high. There's no point in building high DPS glass cannon  if you cant live long enough to get your full rotation off.

TL;DR Had akali built rylais first then they would have had a MUCH better shot","1409529864"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Throw away for really really obvious reasons. Not a teacher but the brother of someone who showed obvious signs of issues during the formative schooling years.

What was he like during school? Super aggressive with a red button that was easy to push and when it was, it always ended up violently. 

He was moved from School to School with the inevitable result that no school would accept him any more and he was sent to a spec ed school for troubled/violent children. This was particularly annoying for me and my younger brother because his reputation followed us everywhere and we were painted with the same brush. 

Due to my surname being very recognisable and quite unique there is a lot of areas where we used to live that I use a false name just so we do not come across any old 'acquaintances'.

What was he like outside of school? The exact same. I ended up just never speaking to him, never being at home or generally anywhere near him at any point because of his violent outbursts - to which the entire family were subjected to. I moved out when I was [removed: really really young] and got my own place, one of the strong contributing factors is the simple desire to not be anywhere near him.

I have not seen him in some time but the last I heard he was in prison for beating someone almost to death with a brick.

TL;DR Me ranting in a very selfish way about ultra-violent sibling.

Got a msg from someone asking a question. If anyone else wants to know more, feel free to ask.

"buildaboat","t5_2sz68","Regarding plywood quality, it depends on you, really. Some people want to make a jewel, a perfect, furniture-like glossy lovely elegant thing that makes them happy every time they see it. Some people want to knock a boat together this weekend so they can go sail next weekend. Most of us are on the scale between the two. The closer you are to jewel-like objects of beauty, the more you should use the best materials. The more likely it is you'll still have this boat in twenty years, or that you'll do a good enough job on it to sell it if you get sick of it, the more you should consider using marine ply. 

For myself, I use cheap 1/8"" doorskin a lot of the time, and when I'm done with a boat I give it away or toss it. But that's me, think about the level of material cost and quality that will make you happy.

Regarding designs, I think an 8' or 9' fat boat like that is almost always intended to be a tender for a big boat. It has to carry a load and fit in a small bit of deck space, so it's short and fat. 

Before looking at specific designs, sit down and think about your ideal day of sailing. Are you alone or with someone? What kind of conditions are you likely to find? Lots of chop? Open water? Big wind? Dead calm mornings? Very shallow water? How good a sailor are you? How dangerous is it for you to get wet (ie, is it really cold where you sail?)

If you're going to cartop, I'd try very hard to keep it under 100 lb. The little 14' x 28"" beam kayak I posted the picture of weights 35 lb. That's nice to cartop. For me, 80 lb or so is a lot to get on top of the car after I've been sailing all day, and 100 lb is the absolute limit. I don't want to be sailing all day, tired, and struggling to get a 150 lb boat on top of a car, that's just not fun.

So for me, the Triad you pointed to is too heavy to cartop.

So, for example, if you want to sail by yourself and don't mind a few minutes assembly time, a sailing kayak with outriggers is pretty cool. Like this:

http://www.clcboats.com/shop/boats/wooden-sailboat-kits/touring-kayaks/clc-sailrig-kayak-canoe-sailing-rig.html

There's even a quote from me at the bottom of the page! I'm kind of amazed that's still there. 

I made some outriggers last summer for the little kayak I sail, for sailing in rough water and bigger wind:

http://imgur.com/JMFO1mq

http://imgur.com/n2aNBq6

This is a great boat, it's fast and capable and easy to sail, and the whole thing cartops fine, all the bits are very light. But it takes a few minutes to put together (say fifteen minutes from arrival at the beach to sailing), and it's a one person boat.

If you want to carry someone with you, you could go for a two person kayak and do the same thing. Or, you could get something like this:

http://home.windstream.net/lkendall/cartopper/

That's a Bolger Cartopper. It's about half the weight of the boat you pointed to, and weight is a big deal here. This is one sailing:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-rvu9seWXI

I think that's a really nice boat. The blog should give you some idea about how hard it is to build.

Simpler and cheaper and boxier and perhaps not quite as pretty:

http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/mayfly12/index.htm

http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/mixer/index.htm

http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/paulsboat/index.htm

etc: http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans/jim/michalak.htm

I find his boats quite ugly, frankly, but there's no getting around the fact that they are dead easy to build, plans call for cheap plywood and deck screws, and they sail like hell. Much better boats than you'd expect. You could save some weight by using 1/8"" on decks instead of 1/4"".

More places to look: 

http://www.duckworksbbs.com/plans.htm

Duckworks is run by my buddy Chuck, who does not list designers he thinks are full of crap. So everyone there, in my opinion, is drawing pretty nice boats at one level of finish or another. They're all real, they've all been built and sailed, it's not vaporware. You might troll through and look at weights, lengths, and general descriptions and see what jumps out at you.

And keep posting! This is interesting. :)

On the other hand, if you think you'd be satisfied with a more working-class life, then you're right in feeling that school is basically a waste of time. There's nothing you'll learn after about 9th grade that will help you as a plumber, salesman, waiter, or office worker.

I chose the latter option, and dropped out. I wouldn't advise it for everyone, but I have no regrets about quitting school. The restlessness and boredom you're describing sounds like my school days.

I'd say, give yourself a month to think it over, talk to your parents, talk to other adults you respect. There's no turning back from a decision like this, so listen a lot -- and then decide what's best for yourself. You're the only one who can decide.","1409529881"

Of course, they don't all use the name Nielsen because that would be a tipoff, so they use identity theft to change their names. 

Furthermore, they have to periodically bring in new blood to prevent the side effects of inbreeding. So every year they bring a few families into the fold and give them a new identity.

And because they've gotten so good at identity theft, they were able to falsify Obama's birth records, and now are the true power behind the throne. 

Of course, they absolutely needed Romney to lose because, as a Mormon, he has access to birth records going back hundreds of years.

Recently I had a good time testing Trinus with a classic: Doom or, more precisely, GZ3Doom, available at http://rotatingpenguin.com/gz3doom (open console and set vr_mode 3 for stereoscopic sbs).
First person shooters in general work well, but since you use mouse look emulation it is not ideal (with the exception of Arma series, which have support for TrackIR)... for those I recommend using the real mouse for precision aiming and head tracking for 'long turns'/look around, might take a bit to get used to but it is still pretty cool. Crysis 2 is nice, because it integrates sbs (no need for tridef, vireio or similar), but had to lower graphic settings to keep good framerates on my laptop.
Finally, I enjoyed Amnesia a lot when I first played a few years ago... scary shit. Would like to try that again with Trinus (and possibly diapers).

"politics","t5_2cneq","The laws that prevent abuse of power in the US have been slowly eroded over the past few decades. Mostly because the rich have too much money, and have influenced lawmakers.

You act like the alternative to enormous income disparity is forcing everyone to make the same amount of money which is completely ridiculous. Some people will always make more money. I wouldn't ever suggest they shouldn't. It is the two ends of the spectrum being so far apart that is the problem.

At the top of the spectrum... Some people make way too much relative to everyone else. Those people should not be able to exert their will over millions of others who have no say in public policy. In addition, they get laws passed that benefit themselves financially while hurting competition and the consumer.

At the bottom of the spectrum... Fiscally responsible people working a full-time job for minimum wage should be able to be financially stable. That means they can afford housing, food, transportation, have a little left over for entertainment, and be able to save money if not for retirement at least for a rainy-day. And not be a paycheck away from bankruptcy or in crushing debt. We are nowhere close to this standard, and it is fucking shameful.

The rich have a choice, there is no ethical dilemma. Not only do they have the means to move out of the country. They can choose not to make income. They can put all their money in zero interest cash account and live off that and not pay a dime in income taxes. Whining about income tax is basically whining about making money. They can rent an apartment and not pay any property taxes.

The DM was a very poorly socially adapted fellow, which is not unusual to find in this venue, I'm sure you know. Tried to befriend the guy a bit, as he just seemed lonely and unsure about what to do about it. He kept making polyandry sort of jokes, but at a certain point it became obvious he was sort of resentful of my husband and I, and may have had a crush on me. He sort of snapped one day over something I can't even remember now. From that point on we pretty much just cut ties with him. One of the other female group members then clued us in that he had had many other couple friends (the group member and him were buddies). All these friendships had ended the same way, with him snapping on someone. The guy is too stubborn and lost in his own head to understand what he may be doing wrong, and I swear one day he's going to go off on some poor person(s) and someone will end up hurt or dead.

Given the content that you have already planned in your updated table of contents, my feedback:

- It is great that you are writing about pushing messages to authenticated and logged in users. This is something that many golang tutorials do not do at all, or gloss over.
- It is great that you are writing about background processing tasks. Again, this is something that I find quite often glossed over in many golang tutorials.
- Deployment. I request deployment using Docker. Given Docker is written in golang, that will likely be a popular choice among golang developers.
- I concur with the other comments - Eschew all-in-one frameworks like beego, and go for libraries such as gorilla instead.
- Testing. Please include a section describing how to write unit tests for the web app as you develop. If this is done as a separate chapter, that would be good. If this is done in line with the rest of the content, alongside development, that would be even better.

You have not mentioned what database technology you are planning to use yet. If you have not made up your mind, I would vote for Postgres. Reasons:

- Most golang tutorials out there are based on either mysql or mongodb
- Postgres is capable of storing both traditional relational data and document data - including [JSON](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/functions-json.html) - which means you can explore both types without the overhead of installing two different databases.

Lastly, thank you for taking the time to develop a resource like this. I have signed up for updates, and will purchase the book when it comes to fruition. Also, if you are writing this book and decide to post your repo on github/ bitbucket, point us in its direction!

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title -&gt; *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","&gt; Were they simply bio-engineered machines, they wouldn't need to worry much about endurance, and a virus would likely not have as large of an effect.

Not necessarily. Anything living has to worry about stamina and viral intrusion, even if it was genetically engineered. 

&gt; It just seems to me that the only way it'd work like that otherwise would be if the Tenno were essentially transient souls that just inhabited what are essentially bio-machine corpses... and on that note, what Void Vor says after you killing him supports this theory, as he states that he has become energy and can not be destroyed.

Yeah, that was the basis of my theory. 

&gt;However, at the same time, the whole energy being theory is a little iffy, as the Orokin name them as their ""rejects"" of an experiment before using them in the war against ""the Sentients."" If the Tenno were completely reliant on inhabiting technological corpses, the frames would not have been as useful, as the Sentients likely could have just assimilated the technology. That's what I think, anyway.

I think the whole deal that made the Tenno so dangerous was that while the Sentients could replicate Warframe technology (Zanuka is proof that that is not that difficult), they couldn't replicate the Tenno and the power that they channeled through it. Further reinforcing the theory is why it is so important that the Tenno are captured alive; Warfames are destroyed all the time, but when Zanuka or the G3 capture a Tenno, they project some weird energy field. It is not entirely unreasonable to suppose that this energy field might inhibit the transference of the Tenno's ""soul"" from the Warframe in an emergency extraction. 

I'll admit that might be stretching it, though, and there are all kinds of holes that can be poked in that theory.

Same thing goes for practically any old champion that hasn't been completely reworked. Also,  guy is isn't all good for Trist. What recent AD champion has had purely magic damage abilities and nonexistent scaling?

As for diversity, why should we look to homogenize Tristana rather than keep her different and give her small nerfs to better highlight her weaknesses?

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","I don't know, precisely, how you're using the term collectivism, but I think that communists in particular are, generally, divided between revolutionaries, typically Marxists, &amp; those who think the sort of authoritarian revolution for which Marx advocated is counterproductive, believing instead that communism is meant to emerge naturally.

Peter Kropotkin, with whose thought &amp; writing I'm not remarkably familiar, expressed, I believe, disappointment toward the Bolsheviks being installed into power following the October Revolution, going on to say, at least, according to the Mises Institute, that the Bolsheviks' actions were demonstrating how a revolution ought not to be made, as he, instead, wanted a ""social revolution,"" through a more libertarian, not authoritarian, means.

That said, it may also be true, depending on how broadly we define this 'collectivism', that it certainly does not entail or even imply an advocacy for communism, &amp; that many people, who I assume you would consider capitalists, are in fact collectivists of a certain variety, which, again, may or may not, include myself.

That said, I'm also aware of many traditional anarchists who reject the 'individualism versus collectivism' paradigm, saying instead that a free individual in a truly (meaning non-capitalist) anarchistic society would individual rights &amp; that the collective itself would have ""social rights"" or something like that, &amp; that the two do not disagree with, contradict, or compete with one an other. I believe this might be the intended meaning of Bakunin's well-known quote, ""Freedom without socialism is privilege and injustice; socialism without freedom is slavery and brutality.""","1409529895"

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","It's not that we have low expectations of our kids, it's just that we have very different expectations of our kids than society does. We tried pushing the ""straight A's and B's"" crap on them. It didn't work. All it created was rebellion, so we stopped doing it when our middle child was in the 5th grade. We told them all that all we expect them to do... is pass. Pass and you don't get in trouble; get A's and B's, you get a reward at the end of the 9 weeks. The pressure was off, the rebellion stopped, and we started seeing massive increases in their grades and positivity in their attitudes toward school in general. 

We don't believe standardized education is that helpful once a certain point is reached in school, particularly by high school level. We let them be interested in the classes that they're interested in and if they're not interested in a class, we don't expect them to excel at it for the simple sake of excelling. Example: I see no reason whatsoever why I should force them to do well in Spanish for the sake of doing well in Spanish. There's no point in it when their efforts are better expended elsewhere in their lives, such as learning how to make money outside of having a regular ""job"".

We are self-employed, financially stable, and don't hold a career working for someone else in very high esteem nor do we hold college in very high esteem, because in most instances, it's a completely unnecessary expense. I would rather teach them the skills that they need to survive in **any** economy than push them towards a career working for someone else where they basically become a 9 to 5 slave in golden handcuffs. They are learning to rely on their own skills instead of the skills of an employer to keep them in work. A person can be a fantastic accountant, but if the company they work for goes under and they don't know how to market their skills effectively, the college degree is worthless.

Where one family may teach their children to go to become doctors, we're teaching ours how to to own the hospital. Where one family may teach their children to be programmers, we teach our kids how to own the development company. We're teaching them to be leaders, not subordinates. This matters more than anything they teach in school.","1409529895"

I really liked the feedback about my word choice sounding male. I am definitely female but that point is moot since there's no way to prove that to you guys other than pics which I won't do.

I think my language isn't as feminine and flowery because I mostly hung out with a lot of guys growing up. In highschool with swimming and running it was mostly guys. Other than college stuff, I spend a ton of time on the internet and gaming. I mean I'm all kitty faces and rainbows and ponies and shit, but also like ""wow noob you fucking suck , log off life kid, you're bad"" ( yeah I've said that to people in video games before )

Part of me is cynical about her, buffering myself in case it's all an act. But I hear songs like ""Old Money"" and can't help thinking she's just as lost, feeling, and loving as everyone else. ","1409529898"

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","The first quit was because I had no access to weed for 3 weeks because I moved to a new city. I was actually happy that I stopped smoking but didn't have anything against going back, so when a coworker offered to smoke me out I obliged. This was 1 year after starting.

About 3 years into my 'addiction' I quit again but this time it was because I was sick of the anxiety I had all the time. I felt like I couldn't stand up for myself to my roommate's who were what people call 'haters'. I quit for about 20 days then relapsed, thinking it was going to be a one-time thing. But unfortunately I smoked the day after and every day since until my third attempt at quitting.

The third time was this past June. Again I was sick and tired of wasting too much money, feeling like I didn't have the balls to stand up for myself and felt lonely all the time when I didn't have weed. I quit for 11 days. At day 11 I was so desperate that I cleaned out the resin from my bong then dabbed it. After feeling the initial rush of euphoria I remembered why I had smoked weed for so long. Because it felt so good! So my high rationalized that since I only live once, I should enjoy my life by smoking more to make myself feel better (wth was I thinking?!?).

Now I hope I am officially done. I woke up from bed 12 days ago like usual, feeling like shit, because I was sober. Before reaching for the joint that I had pre-rolled for myself the night before for my wake and bake (as I do every morning) I chose to get on reddit because my stash was too far away from the bed and my laptop was next to me. I am subscribed to /r/leaves so I read a post that was on my reddit main page. That led me to browse the subreddit and then realize that the people on this sub are right, weed is harmful and I have to stop kidding myself. I flushed that joint down the toilet, gave my bong away and then deleted my dealer's number. It was hard because I tried to relapse 2 days later but couldn't find my dealer's number anywhere. That was definitely a tough day, I went to bed feeling defeated because I didn't find weed. But I woke up on day 3 like ""oh wow, the urge was only temporary"". So now I view any slump or any urge to smoke as only a temporary feeling.

And yes I can finally eat food without feeling nauseous . This is the third day in a row that I've been eating 2000+ calories.

I think if we can accept that each smoke urge will fade away we can defeat the habit. The urges have already become less frequent and shorter in duration.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","My husband and I got our son recently through child welfare and he's our entire universe. I'm not able to get pregnant, so we got really lucky with this little guy. He's toddling around, smiling, and making us laugh as I type this. We're downsizing to allow me to be a stay-at-home mom, and my husband is reducing his work hours to allow him to be home more.

My husband and I both come from parents who were drug addicts, heavy drinkers, gamblers, etc. I was beaten as a child many times, and my husband was smacked around a bit. We have both vowed to be NOTHING like our parents. We don't believe in corporal punishment and we aren't addicts or alcoholics. We're trying very hard not to bring our family nonsense into our son's life.

Our son had 4 homes in the first 10 months of his life, with our home being the 4th. Because of that, he has some developmental delays that we are working very hard to improve. We think he's perfect, but his visits with the pediatrician have shown some red flags for autism. He has a formal evaluation coming up this week that will tell us more and allow us to better help him.

We found out after he was placed with us that we are entitled to a reimbursement check to help pay for his needs like clothing, diapers, food, books, toys, baby wash, etc. Every single cent of that check goes to him in addition to the money we spend on him that my husband earns. We furnished his entire room out of our own pockets, and once we move, we will be upgrading his furniture, painting, and creating a room that he can truly feel at home in.

We make all of his own meals here at home and he's not allowed things like fast food and soda. We're very focused on healthy eating, sleep training, reading, music, and playing right now. As he grows older, we'll be introducing sports, theatre, art, dance, and other activities that he shows an interest in. We want him to be able to experience as much as possible, and to have the option to do what he likes best.

The only reason I'm telling you all this is because I want you to hear about a child in the system going to a good home. We've all heard horror stories, but we are determined not to be one of those families that lets their children down and makes them feel unsafe and unloved. This boy is loved and he makes us better people.","1409529907"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","That is an extremely low OG; it likely fermented it all out in one day and there is nothing left to eat.  What you have made is a very light starter for another beer (use the yeast cake).

The ""bit by bit"" (aka stepfeeding) has its issues.  Two off the top of my head: 1) youre diluting your IBU (hoppyness) with more volume, 2) the yeast a have already released a fair amount of funky flavors fermenting at 22C that no stepfeeding regime is going to solve.

Lets say you have 5 gal of beer that dropped 8 points (1.010-&gt;1.002), but you wanted to get 10 gallons (starting point) at least to 1.040 (which is still a small beer) so that youll have extra 8 points dropped in your final batch (potential alcohol starting at 1.048).

Use the C1V1 + C2V2 = C3V3 formula (concentration*volume) to figure out your gravity issues.

C1V1: ((1.002) *(5gal))  
C2V2: ((???) * (5gal))  
C3V3: ((1.040) * (10gal))  

Algebra =&gt; C2 = 1.078.  Youre going to use more extract than you thought to get a good beer.

Also, 22ºC is too hot for 1098 yeast (19±1ºC is better) and will not make the best beer (fermentation generates heat, and it will never get any cooler than the air temp... you like banana beer??, cuz thats where your headin' with those fermentation temps).

Put your fermenter in a tub or tupperware/rubbermaid container thats slightly larger, fill the tub with water and use frozen water bottles to keep the bath cold. Monitor the water bath with some kind of thermometer.

My advice: Make an entirely new batch of beer (and dont make the same mistakes twice); eat the loss on the hops and make a better beer.  Use this failed batch as the yeast cake on which to pitch this new beer (get rid of the liquid, only keep the yeast cake at the bottom. **Control the temperature of the fermenter**: it makes a HUGE impact on the final product.","1409529907"

Ostarine could be safe, but like I said, nowhere near the research and testing has been done on it as has something like test or even tren. You might run it and have no sides, or experience nothing but sides, especially because many places that sell it are not the most reputable and you could be taking in some harmful toxin. 

You said you are running a test cycle, so why not just run that as it will provide many more benefits. If you want to throw something else in there that fills a niche, try an oral such as dbol or anavar.

We get a lot of robot and alien/mutant-type designs based on land mammals and maybe a little bit of sharks/octopi rarely (in my experience - I could easily be myopic about it).

I feel like a fully ocean-themed game could be a lot of fun, as water movement is similar to flight in a lot of games and can get around the pitfalls of grounded locomotion. Also, the dark depth of the oceans are up there with fog-choked forests of towering pines in terms of Lovecraftian terror, which is great for theming in villains. Ocean life comes closest to our concept of alien life, and it's right here on Earth.

This is all the American's fault for forcing Putin to not really invade, but kinda invade Ukraine who is shooting at Russian soldiers (but for the purpose of this narrative we'll call them civilians).

They've been connected by rail forever and of course driving they're only about 7 hours apart. I'm not a historian, but I know both have some common characteristics. Black leadership and influence in both cities; both on the wrong side of the Civil War; Atlanta had a more extensive rail system but New Orleans has always been a large shipping port; both were major destinations and populations in the Old South that were always connected; and both had sports teams that faced each other very regularly - Falcons &amp; Saints, Hawks &amp; Jazz, UGA &amp; LSUseless. The chartered bus rides and train rides between cities for sporting events were called ""The Soul Patrol.""

Living in both places I have to say I never really detected a huge amount of rivalry except for sports where on the larger stage, college and high schools are sometimes lumped into the same region/conference so again they play against each other a lot.

I truly loved both places for different reasons. New Orleans for the food, history, culture,  and atmosphere (night life).  Atlanta for vibrant business, Southern charm, hospitality, and attractions.  Both places are awesome. ","1409529926"

"xxketo","t5_2u80h","This is a subject that I feel a lot of passion for these days. Obviously I'm not a doc, but I would strongly urge you to keep digging for answers. If the only test your docs are running are for TSH, that's almost worthless information. I was told for close to 10 years that I was fine and I clearly wasn't. I was just getting sicker and sicker. I honestly don't know if it contributed to my four year old being born with developmental disabilities or not (she has chromosomal abnormalities). I'll never know for sure, but the thyroid has a big impact on pregnancy and the health of the baby. It kinda haunts me.

The symptoms you describe can certainly go along with thyroid issues. Please get a copy of your labs and look to see what tests are being run and compare it against what should be run in a full thyroid panel. It has to include much more than TSH. It took me a long time to find a doc who listened to me and ran the right tests and gave me a proper diagnosis. Since I have Hashimoto's, my body produces thyroid antibodies, which aren't picked up on the (in my opinion) worthless TSH test. If you know in your heart something is off, it likely is. I had to get VERY sick before I was diagnosed and I'm still climbing out of the hole, two years later. I don't think I'll ever be the same person and that's scary. 

Another thing that really affected me was brain fog. Can't tell you how stupid I got. I'm having this flare-up right now and I can barely remember words when I'm speaking. I thought my kids destroyed all my brain cells, but nope, just my crappy thyroid at work ;) Keep asking questions of your doc!! Don't give up if something's not right. ","1409529930"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Yes, between freshman/sophomore year.  This is not nearly as typical as the internships you might land before Junior and befor Senior years though, be aware.  This was more like a local tech company that had advertised for interns and I though, ""Why not?""

You can start really early.  As a Freshman, get in your intro programming courses.  If you never had any experience programming prior, generally a university will have a year long intro program, or 2 semesters.  If you HAVE, they often will have an accelerated programming course where they will skip a lot of the basics.  Don't take this unless you actually have serious programming experience, not just dicking around on your TI calculators lol.  That doesn't count.

Anyway, you can work with professors, and you can work for businesses.  There are lots of ways to get internships and usually your university has ways to connect.  Applications for summer internships start as early as September for next year, but you can often find them available all the way to March or April.  Just do your research.  It WILL be harder to land an internship if you are just a Freshman now, but if you try hard, someone can find it.  It is easier to find work with professors as a freshman in my experience.","1409529933"

I think he's a much bigger threat as he's probably our second option on the left wing and that's where Campbell's best chance of play time should be.  On the right, he's got to compete with Sanchez/Walcott/Ox.  On the left, its more like Ozil/Cazorla, and now Poldi again since his rumored moves didn't happen.  If Poldi had been shipped out, Campbell would probably be 2nd place on the depth chart on the left.

I agree in principle that it would be great to see Joel getting more playing time.  I'm on the same page with you there.  I can see why Wenger is doing what he's doing, though.  It's maybe not the way I'd like, but it makes sense.","1409529934"

There is always the benefit of not having to pay money, but if I wanted to, or if I were to, I've come to the conclusion that there are 34 chests in the vault you have to pay for, 500 apiece. It ends up at 17000 gold.

From what I know, 500 gold is equivalent to $5.00, but, I know the higher gold packs give you more for free. How much money would I have to spend to have 17000 gold, or to get it to a round number, 20,000?","1409529936"

"howtonotgiveafuck","t5_2tna8","Sounds a bit like the *wu wei* of Taoism; Appropriate action by non-action; Letting go of the will to control and change, and instead letting the situation unfold according to your sense of empathy and love. Feeling that the current moment is *wrong* and that it *shouldn't be* only leads to confused action. Instead, accept the current moment (your urges and intuitions) for what it is, and go from there. This doesn't mean that you should disregard the safety or well-being of others, but this is really not an issue since the will to harm others directly grows out of the feeling that *something is wrong*. If *everything is as it should be*, even when it feels bad, then you can try to improve it without a perceived need to punish and harm *that which is wrong*, because nothing is wrong, it just is what it is.

Just don't forget that you depend on your environment. It is what you grow out of. So in order to take care of yourself you must *also* take care of your environment and the individuals you surround yourself with. But do it with honesty.

Oh and yeah, you're completely right when you say that one shouldn't spend a lot of time trying to impress others; If you impress people by putting on a false act, then they are only impressed by the persona that you play, not by the *you* that is doing the acting.

The point is that the punishment scales with income, so you're no better off being poor than you are rich.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have had too many attempts to recollect them all. Some more serious than others. Sometimes had specific reasons that pushed me to try to kill myself and other times I just felt overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, lonely, confused, uncertain, miserable, guilty. IT would pretty much take one screw up for me to snowball in my head until I just shut down, give up, stop talking to people, lose all motivation to do anything, even sleep, I would lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. Ive tried cutting too deep, driving after too much to drink, hanging myself, trying to inhale a mixture of bleach and chemicals, tried to drink and take a load of pills, tried to stand in the middle of the road in front off an on coming car, ive spent time laying in the middle of the road at night hoping someone will come along and drive right over me, I swear ive tried almost everything. Im still here. Some of those attempts were petty, some were attempts im surprised I survived and im happy that I never hurt anyone when I went driving. Most of my attempts I covered up, ive never told a soul about some of the things I have done, I was only caught once during a not so serious attempt and I spent some inpatient time at the mental facility for that one. Sometimes people would notice my scars, sometimes to rope marks on my neck. My parents tried to get me to go inpatient many times, I usually lied my way out of going and had to attend many many outpatient classes, psychiatric appointments and therapist appointments. Id say that ive gotten better some days, and other days I would say ive gotten worse. I think now I am more serious. I know what I would need to do to not screw up again but I try to stay positive and push on. I feel I have potential that I need to find and i dont want to give up in the face of adversity when I have my life ahead of me. But my drug and alcohol abuse has skyrocketed because im trying to self medicate to avoid letting anyone know that I am hurting, but they know. Keep strong people, im trying too.

Edit: to clarify, I am a male, this started when I was 15 and im 22 now. Ive been clinging to the belief that maybe ill be better next year.","1409529942"

But in all seriousness they have a big design dilemma on their hands. Stamina wasn't the really problem, it was non-burst melee builds that relied on stamina that are disadvantaged in this game. 

The only think I could think of would be a stamina rebate or return passive for stamina melee skills (S&amp;B, 2H, DW) on a successful (non-blocked) hit. That may allow a melee build to stay in the fray longer if they were skillful and landed some good hits.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; What? Yes you do. You say “I have eaten”, but “she has eaten”. That’s conjugating an auxiliary verb right there. Not to mention that they’re not always auxiliary verbs anyway, only in certain contexts.

Have is the auxiliary verb which you're definitely *not* conjugating. Not eaten - which you are. So again, you do not conjugate auxiliary verbs. Also, the context you used them in they were auxiliary verbs.

&gt; Because “teach” –&gt; “taught” exhibits “teach” as an irregular verb. If it were regular, its past tense would be formed as “teach” —&gt; “teached”.

That summation of what an irregular verb is, is fairly accurate, but this is what makes English so beautiful. I don't think teached has been popular just through societal evolution of pronunciation. Spelled comes from the Old French, as where taught was from Germanic &gt; Old English. You do make a very strong case, so job well done.","1409529948"

And you sound like me, right before my first relapse, about 6 years ago.

Things got better when I stopped drinking. So I figured that they could probably STAY better if I made sure to drink LESS, right?? So I kept going out with friends, and I'd ask for a Jack and Coke with just HALF a shot of Jack. Brilliant! Or go to dinner and have HALF a glass of wine. YEAH! And within a month, I was totally back to where I was before I quit, because I am an alcoholic. 

My second relapse was even WORSE.

In order to STAY sober, I had to STOP DRINKING. It sounds so silly, right? But really, no half shots, no half glasses. For me, that included no hanging out at the bar. No booze filled parties and going home when the holiday dinners turned to after dinner drinks.

I know that I can't keep you sober. But please know that if you are an alcoholic, you need to stop drinking and STAY STOPPED. When you are an alcoholic, one drink is too many and 100 is never enough. You can't have just a little, because it leads to too many.

Let me know if you need to talk, because I'm not the ""classic"" alcoholic, either.","1409529949"

First of all, how transfers work. 

The team only keeps 2/3 of any fee, he rest goes to the league. 

Of that remaining amount only $650,000 is usable for players. 

The rest may only be used for ""soccer related infrastructure"" such as stadium upgrades, scouting, academy, etc. MLSE is already spending tens of millions on this. 

Secondly, the whole point of DP is that it is exempt from all these rules,  and lets MLSE use their own money without constraint. 

Therefore, transferring Dafoe is one of the most useless transactions I can imagine. 

The only reason this happens is because Jermaine wants to leave, if that's the case, then sucks for TO. ","1409529950"

Obviously he wasn't a murderer or something so it's not like i'm keepin' the streets of Gotham safe or some shit,  but they sure were appreciative. 

But the bank reimbursed me, and the police statement allowed me to get another phone free of charge. Which was nice of them.

&gt; The Orzhov Syndicate is the Ravnican guild of business, where the values of white and black meet, **where the dead exist solely to rule**. Nearly every business in Ravnica ties back to the Orzhov in some devious way or another. Whilst they bear the facade of a religious group and may well have been a true faith at the signing of the Guildpact, **they now worship only profit and power.**

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

I don't preach to you because I hate you, I hate that your being lied to. I hate that you have an inferior product, and are not enjoying it to the full extent that you could. I hate that you are being gypped on prices for games. I hate that you accept all these things with a smile on your face and an empty wallet.

If you came in here because of youtube, you should know that Youtube is the cancer of internet comment sections. Nothing in there should be taken seriously. Just about nobody tells the truth. 

Plenty of Pcgamers own consoles. But PC is objectively superior. If it offends somebody to hear that, they aren't emotionally developed and are easily offended.

And why not direct them to this subreddit? if they ask nice questions, they get treated nicely. If they come in like a dick, they get told they are a dick. I run into enough jerks online, I don't need more in my games.

Food for thought implies you are saying something we haven't heard before and are being oh so wise and imparting knowledge on us.

I don't know who you are. Don't ever presume to know more than somebody on the internet. Chances are, you don't. Somebody always knows something more than you do. Almost nobody in this subreddit is the evil PC bogeyman you described. and the few that are, Im certain are trolls. 

PC is for everyone. Its open to all. Just do the math, and learn that you can save money, and do better, on pc. It just takes a little step. 

TL;DR The entirety of your post can be broken down into ""I assume there are a large number of strawmen, and come to whiteknight them away!"" Just stop.","1409529957"

"indieheads","t5_2zj24","The Flaming Lips/Beck tour was such a ridiculous idea from the outset that it's no surprise there was beef, really.  It would've been a great idea for any other beck album at that point, but sea change was very austere and melancholic and the flaming lips were in full LCD good times pop mode.  What's more, the Flaming Lips live show at that point consisted of one guitar, bass, drums and vocals accompanied by a backing track.  They had to hire a keyboardist/singer AND figure out what the hell Wayne was going to do.  He's a consummate showman; he wasn't exactly gonna stand in the back and play the tambourine for 90 min.  The whole thing was one of those ""sounded like a good idea at the time"" things that quickly reveals itself to be way too impractical to work.  
  The dynamics of relative fame and popularity also played out very strangely as well.  Beck hadn't settled into his current elder statesmen indie legend role quite yet; I think beck and a lot of others thought midnight vultures' disappointing sales compared too delay were an aberration, and that his next LP would lift him to the upper echelons of mega stardom, so I suppose him getting the FLips as his band was meant to up Beck's indie cred while in turn exposing the FLips to a much wider audience.  Instead the reverse was true;  Flaming Lips had all the propulsive heat and the zeitgeist on a leash and even though sea change was a great record, it wasn't a soundtrack to the times lets put this on and party album by any means. 

It's also worth noting that the whole ""Wayne coyne is a prick"" thing is a recent development.  Back in the Yoshimi era,  Coyne was very boldly positive and no-bullshit when such a thing was rare in indie.  He was like Fred Rogers back then.  Beck was always rather aloof and inscrutable, and coyne's beck diva angle was an easy sell, unfortunately for beck.  

Sure was interesting, though, even if it was by no means a success.   ","1409529961"

As for why this was posted, I am leaning more towards the fact that it was leaked, perhaps in malice. Or it was posted on a facebook group and somehow was able to be downloaded and released. I find it highly unlikely that they posted it on their own accord

The best proof is the fact that the video is posted under the title of ""Scandal etc. etc."". If it was a gay couple getting married, they wouldn't call the video that.

As for the people, as of now no news indicates their fate. But there have been instances before of people getting arrested for actions on youtube. For example, just last week a girl who was inside a ""sex tape"" on youtube was caught (somehow they found out from the video that she lived in al-haram).

Programs like [7zip](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sevenzip/7z920-x64.msi) do just that and pull each bit out of the archive file piece by piece until everything is properly separated and you computer can easily tell all the files apart. Once you've done that you just need to click and drag the uncompressed files to wherever you want and run the .exe file.","1409529964"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","The ego is an evolved defensive mechanism for solidifying a transcendent objective reality into a delineated and constant phenomenon. 

We perceive time as Past, Present, and Future via a faculty of the ego--fracturing the Eternal Present Moment into a way of making sense of cause-effect relationships. 

Source: Ego death on hallucinogens results in the dilation of time and the otherworldly perceptual phenomenon. Remove the ego and your perspective switches drastically, enabling you to think and perceive in a manner your normal brain would not allow. 

When your ego dissolves, your brain is no longer in 'survival mode' and relaxes the need to solidify and concretize reality, allowing for abstracted thoughts and perceptions

Edit: I consider the ego as a sort of ""placebo effect"" on perception. We have constant perceptions because after our initial perceptions, we have no reason to believe that following perceptions should be much different. What's more, if our initial perception was in some sense blinded to particular phenomenon, then we stand a more difficult time to realize that phenomenon upon further subjection thereto.

1. Programming jobs are very desirable. They're available, have good working conditions, and pay well.
2. Bullshitting a non-technical interview is trivial.

So people who can't develop have a relatively high motivation to seek developer jobs. This is only compounded by both degree mills (so credentials don't necessarily mitigate the risk of not performing a technical interview) and vocally self-taught developers (so you may be able to hire competent developers *without* any credentials) hurting the effectiveness of traditional credential-based non-technical technical screenings.

*edit:* I feel I should point out that, while we spend a lot of time complaining about lack of jobs, poor working conditions, and inadequate compensation, software engineering is objectively a *very* good career path compared to most others, even in white-collar fields. We're not as mobile, well-treated or well-paid as we *should* be, perhaps, but compared to other fields, we do very well on all those metrics.","1409529969"

To invent a group of bloodlusting Jews just to paint a moral equivalency that is both ethically and historically ludicrous... Even I wouldn't go so far as to assume Tarantino is a Nazi apologist. And make no mistake, that's the logical consequence of your interpretation here. If this isn't a straight ""root for the good guys"" revenge film, then why not ground it in historical reality? There are any number of genuine American war crimes from which to examine the moral complexity of war, and the hypocrisy of U.S. postwar mythmaking. So if his point is ""Nazis murder Jews and Jews murder Nazis. We all want to kill!"" it's a bizarre and juvenile take on history.

If there is moral equivalence, then it's historically blind.
If the Basterds are the ""good guys"", then it's vapid violence porn.
If it's an implicit meta-critique of entertainment and art, then it's only the most shallow ""Just so you all know, I'm *self-aware*... now let's get on with the gore!"" kind.

"funny","t5_2qh33","why is everyone on the internet always pissy?

at what point did any one suggest that teachers throw paper at the kids and expect the kids to deal?

are you sure that in all class rooms in the nation it would have been explained orally, more than once, with or without examples?

unless there is a follow up from OP  - can we be sure that the teacher didn't want the kids to do exactly what this kid did? to practice reading, and then to flex their imagination, and have a little fun with colors?
*I* would have done it that way, and used the instructions on the paper as a quick teaching point, to point out to the kids exactly what i said in the last post - at no point does the paper suggest what color to make the shoes, it just has the name of a color in a box with a shoe, which means nothing.

My son got in trouble in the 5th grade. the english teach made him read a story that he discovered that he hated. on the quiz about the book, one of the questions was 'what was your favorite part about &lt;name of book&gt; and why?

my son answered ""The end, because it meant it was over and i didn't have to read any more of this horrible book.""

we got called to a parent-teacher conference for that one, and i backed my son all the way. he followed the instructions on the quiz to the letter, and he told the truth. just because they didn't like the answer, doesn't make the answer wrong. 

there were more questions on the quiz that he answered similar to that one, but all were answered honestly. ""what did you dislike the most about the book?  - reading it. "" 
""what did so-and-so's solution to -such-and-such's problem make you feel? - sad, because it meant he wasn't going to jail and the book would keep going"" "" what made you the most happy about this book? - finding out the writer hadn't made a sequel""

etc etc etc. i told the teacher if they were going to punish him for answering the questions **exactly** and with 100% honesty, then she was worthless as an educator, and she needs to be more specific in her questions instead of just asking how the book made them feel, or what they thought about it. then i pointed out not everyone is cut out for teaching, no matter how much they want to do it. i thought that was very helpful. her, not so much.

we checked our son out right then, and took him to get ice cream. as he ate his ice cream i said ' ok. yeah. that was funny as hell. it was brilliant. we're gonna frame that and keep it forever. you will NOT do it again with suffering dire consequences. 


if the students follow the instructions, exactly, then the teachers can't get upset if the results aren't what they were expecting. when that kind of thing happens, the fault is the teachers, not the students.","1409529970"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt; I would even bet that the average person has seen a hundred times more porn than the average person 20 years ago. Porn is nothing special these days. 

When I was in 7th grade I found a VHS tape in my dad's sock drawer of a bunch of 80's porn that was shittily bootlegged from my uncles subscription of Spice Channel off the satellite dish in his back yard back when satellite dishes were the size of billion dollar telescopes and required a goddamn Diesel engine to rotate around in circles to find what planet satellite rays were bouncing off of best.

I took this tape to my buddy Mark's house when his parents were at work, because Mark was a latch key kid, and about the entire male student body of my junior high class sat in the basement and we watch this tape from beginning to end, everybody dead silent and awkward, and fascinated, and trying to hide the uncomfortable boners in our pants, and general avoiding eye contact.

As weird as it all was, I was regarded as some sort of goddamned liberator, that brought this tape that showed what people having sex looked like, that was way different that what our gym class P.E. Teacher explained to us the year before, with his cross section diagrams of uteruses, and Fallopian tubes, and testicles; which he grudgingly explained because the school district made mandatory for all 6th grade males.

For the next week, I was secretly hurrahed for stealing that tape and organizing the underground screening of Pleasure Maze, followed by Talk Dirty to Me, followed by whatever the movie was where three chicks want to start a porn magazine and fuck suck everybody they have to from the bank loan officer, to the photographers so they can make their dream come true.  I was also incredibly paranoid that one of my class mates would talk to the wrong people and the school would find out and kick me out, then call my parents who would beat me senseless, then call the police who would put me in jail for some sort of charges of warping the decency of society.  The stress was insane.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","I don't agree with the person's insulting tone but their sentiment is accurate IMHO: going too cheap with a PC build is a waste of time and money.

I'm not sure how pounds compare to dollars or how component prices in the US/Canada compare to prices in the UK, but IMHO advising people they only need to spend the worldwide value-equivalent of $500-$600 USD as spent here (as I often see suggested) is just going to result in PS4/xbone-like disappointment.  They'll get something *better* but not by a wide enough margin that the improvement will always be dramatic and noticeable.  Going from 900p30 to 1080p60 is great, but games that are properly tailored to take advantage of PC hardware won't provide the best experience.

There's a sweet spot typically between $800-$1200 where you can get the best value for your money and have your hardware remain ""high-end"" for a much longer time.  Spending more less than that tends to have strongly diminishing returns, in my experience.  Here's what I'd suggest:

- CPU: $150-$250
- GPU: $200-$300
- Mobo: $100-$125
- SSD: $125-$200
- RAM: $75-$125
- PSU: $75-$100
- Case: $75-$100

Total: $800-$1200

Ideally you want to get as many of your components with discounts applied if possible, so you might potentially get as low as $700 if you're patient... but that's really stretching it.  **Can** you build a PC for less?  Absolutely.  But IMHO you have to start making compromises that aren't worth the cost savings and probably end up feeling like you want to upgrade much sooner.","1409529976"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","And then there are the times (which I'm sure are fewer and further between) where they almost or actually do take children away from good families.

My cousins very nearly got taken away from my aunt and uncle when they were little.  Like maybe 2 &amp; 4 year old.  First of all, my uncle is one of the one of the calmest people I've ever met, it takes *a lot*, to get him even the slightest bit fired up over something.  But anyway... it was bath time on a Saturday night for them so my aunt had put them both in the tub together and they were playing in there.  So she left for a second to get something from the kitchen.  When she came back, the door was closed and locked.  And the girls weren't making a peep.  She and my uncle were trying to talk to them and get them to open the door, but they weren't making a sound.  Not even water splashing.  So my uncle had to bust down the door.  Apparently the oldest one (4 year old) was standing in the middle of the bathroom when he did this and got hit by the door.  Nothing serious, but she did get a pretty good black eye out of the ordeal.

So next morning they go to church as usual, the girls get dropped off at sunday school and at some point one of the teachers (who had known my aunt and uncle for quite awhile) asked how she got the black eye.  The so she says ""my daddy did it!"" and goes on her merry little way.  Uhm, yea the lady called CPS on them.  And the CPS worker who was assigned to their case really did not want to believe their story.  They came out to check on them multiple times and were very suspicious of my aunt and uncle every time.

I can say without a doubt that I know they would never do anything like that to anyone.  No one in my family would.  But yea, that's one of my cousin's favorite stories (that and the time the girls and the little boy next door made mud pies, but didn't have any water... so they improvised...) to tell people now.  I doubt she would think it was so funny if it had really been abuse.","1409529981"

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","Hello OP.  I actually run a Residence Hall with the same meal option as the one you are describing.  I have to say that at first it was very difficult to eat correctly, a lot of the food served is usually not what a person interested in body building is looking for.

My suggestion is to stick to the basics, it is what has worked for me over the past 6 years of eating 12 months a year in a buffet style program.  

Most programs have a salad bar, and this is where you will be able to construct most of your meal.  Stay away from hot line options as they typically are loaded with fats/salts (even those vegetables.... they find a way to make those unhealthy also).  Sometimes there is a grill option that will grill chicken breast, and eggs the way you want them.  My school always has oatmeal in the morning, and rice in the afternoon, use this as a good staple for your meals.  Another protip would be to try and make your food less boring, add a splash of hot sauce so you are more inclined to continue eating healthy.  There is also fruit usually available, like apples and bananas (nothing too exciting)... add this to your foods when you can. Sticking with the basics will allow you to have a pretty good idea of where you are at with your macros throughout the day.

Example of what I eat that works for me (6 foot, 250lb, male, 6 day split):  I have 1 more protein shake after working out.

Meal 1 - Breakfast:
-10 hard-boiled eggs (discard all 10 yolks).  My school uses butter (1/4 a stick per item) at the grill so I stay away from it when I can.
-1/2 cup oatmeal
-1/2 cup fruit

Meal 2 - Protein shake

Meal 3 - Lunch:
-1/2 cup rice
-3 hard boiled eggs (discard all yolks)
-1/4 cup fruit
-If the hotline has lean meat (ex chicken breast) I take that, if not then I eat salad tofu and we have fake crab.
-Broccoli and Lettuce

Meal 4:
1/4 cup oatmeal
1/2 scoop protein powder

Meal 5:
-1/2 cup rice
-3 hard boiled eggs (discard yolks)
-Fruit
-If the hotline has lean meat (ex chicken breast) I take that, if not then I eat salad tofu and we have fake crab.
-Broccoli and Lettuce

To be honest, there is more variety in my diet now, then when I was cooking for myself.  It just took some patience and research to continue on a healthy track while eating in the dining halls.

He was kind of a weird kid (very fidgety, jokes that made no sense, short temper) and he would often say how his mom was a bitch (because his parents got divorced and he blamed her). 

Just talking to him he seemed pretty normal, although a bit awkward, for a student. He often got in trouble with teachers because he would talk back to them and submit assignments late.

After graduating I fell out of contact with the guy. I found out that  he had gone to see his younger sister's play with his family. His parents decided to drive home in 2 cars, the guy with his mom and the sister with the dad. While driving in his car he stabbed his mom over 100 times, nearly decapitated her, and then got into an accident. The officers who found him after the crash said he was convinced his mother was the devil and she had to die. I believe he plead insanity and is an insane asylum but I'm not certain of all the details because this was few years ago and I did not really follow the case.

If you look at the replays of this game, you'll find a ton of terrible first half defense from the US. Its a circle jerk because we've been stuck on harden forever and even if this was the only bad defensive play he had all game or all World Cup, we'd go way over the top calling him out because r/nba has a hatred of him.

In regards to your last point, people are just afraid the game will turn out like Brawl did where there will inevitably be one character that can play any way he/she wants in a game where the rest of the cast can only play defensively. It's not a bad game that way, it's just people's fear and the fear is there because they *want* it to be good.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","There's nothing inherently wrong with Bestial Wrath. The other 1 mana attack buff spells give +3 attack (Blessing of Might, Rockbiter Weapon). Bestial Wrath gives +2 AND immune for a turn. Immune is intrinsically a hard ability to balance around. As it stands, Bestial Wrath is a more situational Holy smite/Arcane shot. It beats out HS/AS when buffing a Young Dragonhawk, but other than that it is equivalent to HS/AS.

The reason why Bestial Wrath is never played is because there is currently no room for it. The typical situation for BW is locked down by Arcane Shot. Unless Blizzard changes it so that the +2 attack buff is permanent, or they introduce more windfury beasts, BW will always be considered worse than AS.

The writing was easier to digest, but not in the sense of being more clear - it often just felt dumbed-down. A lot of useful details were ignored or skimmed over. B&amp;B is intimidating, but the writing is not really unnecessarily dry, and it's very clear and easy to understand. There also isn't as much actual text as you expect, because so much of the page is taken up by (excellent) illustrations and diagrams. There might be times when you'll notice it's getting too detailed, but I'd rather have to skim through extra details than be left wondering about fundamental concepts!

Biochem: Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews all the way. You really don't need a lot more than this and for a visual learner, the graphics can't be beaten.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","For the rational case take a = p/q with p and q integers with no common divisors and q positive. Then it's not hard to see x_j = x_{j+q} modulo 1 since 

x_{j+q} = x_0 + (j+q)p/q = x_0 + j(p/q) + jp = (mod 1) x_0 + j(p/q) = x_j.

This means (1/n sum from j=0 to n-1 of f(x_j)) = f(x_0) + ... + f(x_{q-1}) whenever n is a multiple of q. So to prove the sequence is not equidistributed we just need to find an f in C(T) whose integral is not well approximated by the values of f on x_0, ..., x_{q-1}. A good example would be to construct an f that's zero at x_0, ..., x_{q-1} but has a positive spike somewhere so it's integral isn't zero. (Take the modulo 1 of x_0, ..., x_{q-1}, order them in increasing order to get points u1, ..., uq between 0 and 1, make f equal to zero on [0,1] everywhere except for a triangular spike between u1 and u2, then periodically extend f over all of R).

The approach for proving it for irrational a probably depends on how exactly your course is defining integrals and what relevant integral theorems are at your disposal.","1409529997"

Having no degree (or a very soft degree) will make it significantly more difficult to get your foot in the door particularly with larger professional companies (so getting those bonuses in banking will be difficult).

Which isn't a problem if you think that being self-employed (or small business start-up) is your route. Bear in mind that starting a small business is hard work. There is a certain amount of compliance and paper-work that must be maintained - this tends not to be exciting - but is essential to running a business. If you can't motivate yourself to do uninteresting work for university this may be a problem for running a business.

Personally I found myself at university doing a course that didn't interest me. I also had a number of friends who were put off subjects they thought they were interested in by the university course.

I find I learn better by my own direction and with easy access to the internet full of knowledge this is a viable option. (Though internet learning doesn't get your foot in the door with those larger companies, still).

...

A lot of emphasis is placed on the little piece of paper at the end of a degree.

However, this is one of the few times in life you will have a relatively free hand in discovering and learning for and about yourself. Give serious consideration to staying in university just for the university experience. The friends you make at university will stay with you for the rest of your life... making long term friendships later in life happens much less.

Change subject to a soft degree - Something like philosophy or economics have a low workload, low failure rate and leave plenty of time to get involved in student activities. The piece of paper may not be quite as valuable as some other subjects - but the university experience will set you up for life in terms of both the people you meet (it isn't what you know - it is who you know) and discovering where your interests lie.","1409530001"

Then perhaps digging a little deeper than just, ""the poor shouldn't be poor anymore!"" would be a good idea.

&gt;Nothing helps the poor better or faster than putting money in their pocket earned from good jobs, tax the rich schemes won't help nearly as much as good jobs will

Actually tax the rich schemes worked for decades after World War II. Turns out the economy is demand driven and making sure the bottom 99% has access to money is good for everybody.

&gt;Be smart and elect a conservative like Romney next time around, if he'd won the election a whole hell of a lot of the poor population wouldn't be poor right now, Romney campaigned on jobs, jobs, jobs (how soon we forget things like that) and he had the knowledge and experience to make it work.  

Historically democrats oversaw larger expansions in the economy than republicans have. Aside from that, Romney *killed* hundreds of jobs because that was the vampiric nature of his company: he'd buy failing businesses, gut them, and then sell the assets. What we legitimately need is another FDR in the White House. Someone who has a clear vision for how the economy should run that doesn't involve screwing over non-billionaires. Obama's problem is that he followed too much in the footsteps of George W Bush and Ronald Reagan, not that he is *too* liberal.","1409530002"

Is your graph telling me that there were no post-apocalyptic sci-fi books published between 1990 and 2004?

I seriously question your method of sampling books. Not only does your sampling method seem flawed, but the *number* of sample seems a tad low.

___



In addition, I'm curious as to how you calculated the popularity of a book. Did you base that simply on the number of copies sold?

___

EDIT:

I read your blogpost, and I see that you took your data exclusively from amazon.

your 'popscore' seems rather invalid.

A more useful metric might be the number of copies sold during the time of initial publication of the novel (for instance, the cumulative sales within the first three years of publication).

But this still doesn't explain your sampling method.

It might be more insightful to find/collect data that describes the total number of copies of books sold that match the description of ""post-apocalyptic sci-fi"". Although then the debate becomes, ""What qualifies as post-apocalyptic sci-fi?""

Of course the western press is happy to highlight rapes - we browns and darkies are still viewed as brainless natives  by them
As for Caste - funny how no christian is ever asked why a Jew living in the present day deserves to be punished and abused for an alleged crime committed by one of his ancestors. ISIS is in the news today - they say not being a muslim is a crime, but don't mainstream christians and muslims say the same thing? Has even one christian or people like you ever asked why such evil things are being said?
As for Iskcon being loud, that is silly - how about in your face, you are going to hell unless you convert? I live in an indian neighborhood and we constantly get christians using loud music pushing their religion down on our throats
As for women, which country has had not one but two female leaders? which country had a Sikh as PM, a Catholic as the leader of the country, a muslim as the President - and the vast majority of the people were? Hindu! 3 people of minority faiths leading the nation

For example, there are beachfront units for rent in Santa Monica, CA - the units are a GREAT value for the amenities and location and the price is below market vaule - a steal...but if you make more than $70k a year, you can't live there. The idea behind that is to give lower-income people a shot at living in higher-income areas - people who make $70k+ are forced to look elsewhere.

I don't believe Income Based Rent would mean that the rent is based upon a percentage of your income. For instance, the rent is 25% of your income, whether it's $500/month or $5000/month -- that would be invasive, terrible and ridiculous and if such a situation were to exist, I cannot stress enough the speed with which one should run away from that bullshit.","1409530005"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was up there (coming from Texas) last thanksgiving for a funeral. I don't know why they used a refrigerator, they could have just used a shelf. It was a farmhouse from Western Mass from the 1700s and it had all the insulation and wind blocking capabilities of a tent with the doorway unzipped. They had no oil stove, but a pellet stove and wood stove going were enough to warm it up to 40-45 for us. A bit less in the further rooms, though they had millions of blankets and you got plenty warm if you ran around a bit before bed and let your body heat and breath warm them up. It was on this trip that I bought a $15 pair of Wells Lamont gloves, and borrowed a head thing with the chin straps and such. I thought they were amazing compared to my previous ones, which probably made my hands colder because I couldn't warm them up by rubbing them together and becasue they got wet and stayed wet very quickly. I got my own head thing too, either a balaklava or a baklava, whichever is not the pastry. I was not cold for the rest of the winter upon returning to texas. ","1409530008"

As for your overall focus, I'd say you definitely need a fire monster, none of your current fire monster is decent. Fire inugami is always a good start ;) Other than that, you're also going to need another water monster, but for now that water fairy will do just fine.

"DestinyTheGame","t5_2vq0w","That would be an anthropocentric view of ourselves however. We do not know what The Traveler, or any potentially cognizant extraterrestrial for that matter, would think of us until we have made contact and established some form of exchange. The best we could do from our human perspective is to appear as non-threatening as possible without appearing entirely defenseless so as to cover both possible extremes of reaction and hope the unknown entity recognizes this gesture.

As I mentioned in my previous post, we could assume the manned mission to The Traveler must have been a later attempt at information gathering or contact given the mission's risk and expense based on current day technologic capability. I doubt the manned mission was planned and carried out without an extensive remote survey and study of The Traveler beforehand, with previous attempts at remote contact failing to elicit a response. The assault rifles carried on the manned mission would likely be no threat to The Traveler considering it's assumed technologic capabilities. The rifles would only be useful in the event human-sized threats present themselves in which retreat is the only likely viable tactical option given the proximity to the then-unknown entity.

At any rate, presenting three armed individuals present during assumed first contact with The Traveler has nice continuity with the three types of Guardians that have come to largely symbolize the Destiny universe.","1409530008"

"firewater","t5_2rcpo","Slower, but not a lower temperature.  Less heat.  Remember the temperature of the wash is limited at it's boiling point by the ratio of alcohol and water.  When it is boiling, it is boiling, you won't be able to raise the temperature up above that point.  As the alcohol comes off, the boiling point rises.

As distillers, we can control the heat input, which determines how quickly we reach a boil, and from there we determine how vigorous it boils.  The more heat, the more vigorous the boil, the more vapor is released, and consequently the faster product comes off.  The faster you run, the less precise the separation of water and alcohol becomes.  This is why when stripping you run hard and fast (apply as much heat as you can so long as your condenser keeps 100% of the vapor knocked down to liquid) and for a spirit run you go nice and slow.

As for the ""fermenter leaking air into it"" I don't understand what you mean.  OP is using a different distilling pot than the fermenter, so the only thing I can think of is you're referring to an unfinished fermentation.  An air leak wouldn't cause this, I don't run an airlock on my distilling ferments and it still goes all the way dry.  If anything, added oxygen in the ferment will make the yeast run faster, but can lead to off flavors, primarily due to oxidation.  This is a huge deal for beer brewers, but not so much for distillers.","1409530014"

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","One of the main factoring causes for many of Aspergers symptoms is the difference in how normal people perceive sensory input and how aspies do.

And that doesn't begin to describe how it applies to vision, smell, and touch.

We act cold because we have to use a mental wall.

The first thing to do would be to help him build a sensory safe place. Look into a weighted blanket, a white noise machine, blinds. Then work on having them simulate drowning out sensory inputs to clear their mind anywhere.

Recent visage game: You built it as a carry. Build more like a support and you'd probably have done better.

Axe: Seems like you weren't able to seize an early-game advantage, something that Axe needs to do in able to be viable into the late-game.

Enigma: Judging from the XP graph, I think your whole team was responsible. Most likely the enemy team reached critical mass the moment anti-mage finished battlefury and yasha. Not really a clue here besides this.

Tiny: This is one of those games you were destined to lose. Your opponents seemed to prevent most of your team from farming. And despite you getting kills for the team, they weren't able to recover very well. (Also last pick tiny, what the fuck dude?).

Silencer: You had a lion and a rubick, both of which were doing somewhat good jobs at support (well, besides Lion thinking that a shadow amulet -&gt; shadow blade is a ""good transition""). There's no need for you to have built as a support.

Mirana: Early-game you did okay, late game was when it all went haywire. Yeah, you might have been dealing with their team, but it seems you didn't do good at stopping shadow fiend.","1409530020"

2. The broadest unemployment rate your country calculates
3. The labor force participation ratio
4. The employment-population ratio
5. The raw number of jobs added or lost each month

Together the LFPR and employment-population ratio capture something of the demographics of your country. To gloss over a dozen issues, the LFPR tends to tell you something about ""supply"" of labor and the EMRATIO tends to tell you something about ""demand"" for labor, though of course in reality both are influenced by supply and demand.

The official unemployment rate, relative to a carefully constructed estimate of the natural rate of unemployment, is a very nice way to go.

With labor markets you just have to bite the bullet, be willing to look at a lot of indicators, and be willing to make judgment calls.","1409530021"

Brees is a stud obviously. It would be nice to have another serviceable QB, but I guess something's got to give.

Lacy is great but after that there is a significant dropoff. Ryan Matthews could be a consistent guy and safer than Jennigns.

No stud WRs here, but lots of depth. I've seen a lot of teams that have great depth at WR, but not a lot of well identified studs.

Overall, you have a lot of talented guys, but there's a lot of dropoff. I think a good number of your players could turn out well. You definitely have a solid team.","1409530021"

"Foodforthought","t5_2rete","How does a skill define you as a person? By the knowledge that it requires, the memories it has given, and the life that it allows you to lead.  The number of skills long forgotten is staggering. From the sharpening of an adze to the gutting of game, people no longer need to know many skills that would be essential not only to people's livelihoods, but their psychology and way of looking at the world. 

After ten's of thousands of years o cultural evolution would you say that we've gradually lost our humanity? Are we know some minor shell of a once great potential being buried under useless knowledge and thinly veiled vanity? That's a very cynical way of viewing progress. 

Instead people tend to renegotiate what's important as difficulty changes over time. The forefront actively looks for challenging activities as great value can be found in simplifying new processes. Others use their abilities to make value for themselves and other by application and iteration on this new frontier. People have been doing this for all time and I would fight that not only has progress reduced our worth in the past but anyone attempting to make life easier is condemning us to lower values in the future.","1409530022"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Well, I went into the console wars this time around planning to purchase a PS4. I've gone with Sony since Sega dropped out of the Console race - god knows I bought pretty much everything that came out on Saturn and Dreamcast. If Sega entered the market again, I would support them no matter how bad things got... but anyway.

My point is that I've always been a person that's been pretty brand loyal. My reasoning is that I typically go with the company that I feel is focused on making games, and especially focused on making games that I like.

Sony's exclusive games in the past have been especially critical to me liking their system. Games like The Last of Us, Uncharted, even Gravity Rush on the Vita... games like this really sell the Sony brand to me. And that is why I liked Sega over Sony when Sega was still a thing. I felt that Sega just ""got gamers"" more than anyone else out there. I often felt like Sega was making games just for me...

Right now, I feel like Sony is making games ""for me"". Infamous and The Last of Us have both been great experiences. That is what I look for when I purchase a console - I don't care about cross-platform games - if a game is available for both PC and console, I usually get it for PC instead.

So see, I basically was never going to go with Xbox. All of this stuff that has happened never affected me. But having watched it all go down, I admit that I laughed about it, and it made me feel better about my purchase. There's a part of me that wants Xbox to just die and go away. But I know that Microsoft is not like Sega in that they can probably take tremendous, unbelievably high losses and shrug it off. Someone said Microsoft is probably spending 3:1 compared to Sony to keep the Xbox ""in the picture"", and I actually don't doubt that at all.

I view Microsoft as a company that just bought their way into the video game market. Not that Sony didn't do the same thing, but Microsoft just seems so much more transparent about it. The people from Sony talk about their system and their games like they actually care about the games. I don't get that same vibe from Microsoft - instead it feels like ""Hey buy our stuff so that we can make money!""

I don't know, I just think that is the reason Microsoft is doing so bad right now. I think the world kind of sees how shallow they are about why they are selling Xbox. When they came out with Xbox One it was like they didn't even try to mask their attempt to have the Xbox take over all of your media units. So that they can sell and operate all media through the Xbox... it's even called ""One"" and they played up the concept that they only wanted you to have one device in your living room...

It just came across to me like a car salesman or something....

Anyway, if there is a repercussion at all, I hope that Microsoft gets their nose bloodied a little bit, finally, and that they maybe look at this whole games market thing with a bit more humility. I would like to see their next console focus more on games and less on replacing all of your media center units... Not that I would buy an Xbox over a PS anyway.

"pathofexile","t5_2sf6m","I'll comment on the last few:

**Minion Instability** - Gives summoners an extra source of damage from their expendable minions. Good if you use easily replacable high-life minions like zombies and skeletons, bad if you use high-value minions like Animate Guardians or most Spectres (since you're reducing their effective life pool). Minara Anemina - the summoner Rogue Exile - uses this, and if you're melee, you'll quickly find out how much it can hurt.

**Elemental Equilibrium (EE)** - Potentially very powerful, but only works with specific setups that are tuned to use different hits with different elements. The best example I know of for a build that puts it to good use is Explosive Arrow - if you have Cold or Lightning damage on your weapon or gear, your hits will lower a target's Fire resist, causing them to take extra damage from the Explosive Arrow's detonation. A separate Split Arrow, Lightning Arrow, etc. can be used to apply the EE debuff to groups. You may also see this used by Righteous Fire and Searing Bond users, since those skills just apply a Fire degeneration effect and do not ""hit"". They'll use a Cold or Lightning skill to keep their enemies' Fire resist low.

**Conduit** - If you regularly generate charges, and you grab this, your party will love you. Commonly seen on support builds, and well suited to builds like wanders that can easily produce charges. Note that it only applies to party members, and not minions. Mechanically, what it does is grant every nearby (~1 screen length I believe) party member 1 charge whenever you gain a charge yourself, even if the charge you gain just refreshes your duration due to being at your cap. You cannot bypass party members' own caps, even if your cap is larger.

**Vaal Pact (VP)** - Gives the ability to bypass the normal time-based nature of life leech. Normally, you can only leech life at 20% of your maximum Life pool per second. This can be very limiting, especially for builds that deal large bursts of damage, and especially against monsters with reflect auras. The downside of the keystone is its 40% effectiveness, necessitating a large amount of life leech to make up for it, and the inability to make use of natural regeneration. It does not prevent the normal delayed Energy Shield recharge or life recovery from flasks. Some Discharge builds and some melee builds that use claws or Blood Rage will take this.","1409530027"

It would support the idea that as the items are rolled, if an item being generated is determined to be Legendary quality, it checks to see if a trial keystone has been generated yet. If not, the item drops as a keystone. If so, it is generated as a legendary item like normal.

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","1) Sorry I wasn't clear about the shoes! It wasn't a, ""Oh man, I don't trust these girls. They're going to come shoeless!"" It was more of me treating it like dresses where I wanted to see each pair to see they were fine. Now that I think about it though, shoes are probably the last thing people look at in pictures. I'm finding it a little difficult to comprehend where the micro-managing line begins? I've only mentioned shoes a total of three times: 1 around a year ago when I first got engaged and said okay, here are the colors of shoes!, 1 time around half a year ago when I said that I'd pay for their shoes, and then the last time around last week to ask that they have shoes ready by 8/30. 

2) It's not really about having the bachelorette party. I don't mind if they don't throw one actually! It was moreso them not communicating to me about when the date is, because of other scheduling needs I have to meet. :( Because everyone is out of town, and people are flying in different times, literally, the only days that could work for the bachelorette party are Friday morning/afternoon and Saturday. However, because my dad wants to meet my groom's family, and they're also flying in at different times, the only days that could work for that are also Friday morning/afternoon and Saturday. I've asked them to give me a date so I can schedule the other thing, but all I've been hearing are, ""We dunno! We're still deciding the best date!"" But maybe I should just schedule the family meetup and tell my bridesmaids, ""Sorry, this is the only date that works because I've already scheduled this other event.""?

3) Hahaha. It actually did cost me money to attend. I flew back to the state just to attend. So. &gt;_&gt; But regardless, it's never been about money. I'm totally the type of person who shows love/affection by showering others with money/gifts. I've said this like a million times already, but Tiekyl totally explained my thoughts perfectly.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I'm not defending the hacker in any way, hes a scumbag who stole personal property from people who wanted that stuff kept personal.

the difference is:

we expect this guy to go to jail for the theft he has done.

the government can't put itself in jail, so we hold it to a higher standard when it comes to expectations.

no one from the NSA is going to jail for violated the constitution, a legal document that says what is legal and illegal for the government to do, which they are bound to uphold.

also in terms of scale, its a very specific thing (photos) of a few individuals, the government is tracking and logging every action that you make that can be pulled up any time in the future and used against you legally or in a form of extortion. the people in charge of this system are so inept that they gave free access to this system to anyone who might have worked on it at some point and would allow them to have continual access, then employed administrators who have been documented using this system to benefit themselves much in the same way this hacker stole these photos, but all of them are protected because they violated people's rights to privacy under the guise of government protection.

that is why people are mad at the government and not publicly outraged at this guy (because if hes caught, they expect him to be punished).

also great job doing the generalization, I'm sure tumblr would love to have you join up, you'd fit in just fine with that crowd if we morally lesser individuals (which I guess you identify with as well) are not up to your standards.","1409530029"

Fahmy added, during an interview with the Egyptian program of the event broadcast across the Arab screen event on Sunday evening, that during the past three decades, Americans make sure that the current Islamic actor in the region, pointing out that the Americans will continue demanding the integration of mainstream Islam in the political process, even the hottest events subside. 

Fahmi said that Egypt carried out the will of the people will not implement any external dictates, pointing out that the whole world will listen attentively to the speech of Egypt in the General Assembly next United Nations, and to be delivered President Abdel Fattah Sisi in his speech during the meeting, pointing out that his speech would be historic.

Now reddit stylesheet only supports 4 different ones (though 4 is already just normal-sized bold text), because in order to have a noticable difference between more levels, the top headings would probably have to be made bigger, and noone would want people posting uber-large text.

The thing about rainbow gatherings is that you don't have to deal with that. You guys pick a place and everyone shows up separately.

I don't know that I really did that much different -- I like live music so I meet most people at shows.  And when you're loving life and dancing, nobody knows (or cares that) you're homeless.

Once a woman finds you fascinating (and I am certainly that), the fact that you live in a car just isn't the stumbling block you might expect it to be.  In fact, they have a built-in innocent(ish) justification for bringing you home: to offer you a shower and a safe place to sleep.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've attempted several times...

Without too much back story, I was blackmailed/forced into a sexual relationship when I was 13. It lasted until I was nearly 17.

First time I attempted was at 14. I was trying to internalize all the shit I was going through, not let others see how unhappy I was, and it just didn't work. I took a bunch of sleeping pills, laid down, and had a terrifying few minutes where I was conscious but couldn't move... Then I passed out. Woke up the next afternoon, groggy and a splitting headache but otherwise fine... Sleeping pills were just melatonin so no real effects.

The second time was a month later... I had been cutting for a while at this point, on my thighs where people couldn't see. Decided to cut my wrists... Didn't do a good job, bled a lot but didn't actually cut the artery. Just couldn't make myself do it... Spent hours crying and cursing at myself to do it but couldn't. Wore long sleeves for a while.

Third time I was 15... Tied a bag around my neck and took some sleeping pills. Woke up covered in puke with the bag ripped off.

Fourth time was the next night, cut my wrists in the tub... Literally the only reason I'm still alive is my brother came home early from practice. This was the first my family knew anything was wrong; was hospitalized and saw a therapist but refused to explain myself. I just couldn't take my parents/family knowing what I was being made to do.

There hasn't been a fifth time. I have come close a few times though. The first was when the person decided they were going to 'rent me out'; I spent a very, very long night deciding between suicide and going to the cops/telling my parents. I chose the latter pretty much only because of my track record with attempts. 

The second was a few days later... I had a hard time dealing with my parents knowing. It made them argue a lot (they knew the girl doing it; had ""stayed over"", was "" my friend"", an upperclassman.) Lots of guilt especially on my dad's part even though it was NOT their fault. Got through this one by talking (read: crying sobbing meltdown) with my dad. He took the next month off work, stayed with me all day, reassured me; fucking love my dad.

The last time was ~a month ago. I had been posting on gw (stupid yes but it was the only thing to really keep me sane) and was found out by a new neighbor (just moved for college) who told a lot of people. If not for a few people who are AMAZING, I would have done it that night. 

I still internalize any issues, smoke way too much pot, drink too much, go to therapy weekly. I'm getting by though. Had my pics taken down before too many saw them, at least the most explicit ones. And most people have been very cool about it. Still took a leave for a semester at least though... I hope it'll be old news by then.

I know for a fact that I'll have at least one more trigger... But she doesn't get out for several years so I will hopefully be stronger by then.","1409530041"

I'm a bit late to the party, but my boyfriend and I have been together for 10 months or so, and despite his enthusiasm I had only had one orgasm with him, which was during penetrative sex and due to my own hand involvement more than anything else. On Wednesday, however, he managed to give me a mind-numbing orgasm while eating me out, and holy shit have I been missing out! Nothing like my orgasms when I masturbate. I was breathless, shaky, and totally incoherent for quite a while.


But wait, there's more! After some failed attempts over the next few days, last night he was very persistent and got me there three times over the course of maybe an hour max. It was amazing! He kept trying to insist on number four, but I didn't think I physically or mentally had it in me anymore.


Anyway, I'm super proud of both him and myself, and I couldn't be happier right now :)

"vzla","t5_2sh9s","Me siento obligado a comentar aquí ya que comenté sobre Julio Coco en otro post hace varios días donde expuse que nunca lo había oído aclarar su postura sobre cómo han de gestionarse los recursos de la nación. 

[Aquí está](http://www.reddit.com/r/vzla/comments/2e3dtd/julio_coco_y_marea_socialista_rebeli%C3%B3n_en_las/cjvzzm3) el referido comentario.

Debo reconocer que aquí aclaró efectivamente su posición. El modelo canadiense es de alta recaudación impositiva para proveer accesibilidad a los servicios más costosos para el ciudadano. Tengo entendido que existen beneficios fiscales para las personas no naturales apuntando a que éstas puedan ofrecer buenas condiciones de trabajo y así aumentar la capacidad del ciudadano promedio de pagar sus impuestos (principalmente mantener el sistema de salud). Buenos paquetes de empleo permiten amplio poder adquisitivo y posibilitan que los ciudadanos puedan mantener los servicios que el Estado brinda. Los ciudadanos mantienen al Estado. **Que el Estado dependa de sus ciudadanos es el pilar fundamental que evita que este restrinja libertades.** En mi opinión claró está.

Cómo han hecho los canadienses para que sus personas no naturales no utilicen los beneficios sólo para maximizar su utilidad; lo desconozco. Me imagino que será por medio de regulación ya que las empresas difícilmente han de reducir por elección su capacidad competitiva para contribuir a un fin social. USA lleva algún tiempo con ese problema, trata de que la brecha de la distribución del ingreso no siga aumentando pero su sistema de libertades (más que todo económicas) colide con la imposición de cuotas sociales a las corporaciones. Éstas a final de cuentas son las mantienen al Estado mediante su alta capacidad de pagar impuestos por su alta competitividad mundial. Disminuir la capacidad competitiva de la industria norteamericana es atentar contra la base sostiene al Estado. Los ciudadanos organizados para un fin lucrativo son los que sostienen al Estado. **Que el Estado dependa de sus ciudadanos es el pilar fundamental que evita que este restrinja libertades.**

Ambos con sus amplias diferencias tienen en común que el Estado debe apostar a sus ciudadanos, de alguna manera u otra para mantener sus capacidad de prestar servicios. **Para mantener su poder.**

El Estado venezolano por su parte no depende de qué tan exitosos sean sus ciudadanos. Nuestra primera industria; sea de forma privada o sea la fusión de Estado, Nación, Gobierno y PDVSA que tenemos hoy, le pertenece al Estado (en el primer caso) o la fusión (el segundo).

Hay que obligar que el Estado apueste a sus ciudadanos; confiar en la buena fe de los líderes es una estupidez, por muy carismáticos que estos sean. *I'm looking at you chavistas.*

Como dijo Laureano Márquez: incluso si mi candidato gana, al día siguiente he de ser yo su primer opositor. 


Volviendo a Julio Coco, cómo atinar al sistema canadiense cuando el poder adquisitivo venezolano está en el piso junto con nuestro aparato productivo (es decir, padres de familia y empresas están quebradas) está fuera de mi compresión. ¿Darle toda la responsabilidad a PDVSA cuando ella también ha de restaurarse? *Don't think so*.

Lo siento, pero vuelvo a lo mismo, restaurar el aparato productivo es lo primero. Hay que tener qué distribuir para luego poder construir un país con menos desigualdad.

P.S.: Todavía no tolero los chistecitos y lenguaje coloquialísimo por la mismas razones de mi comentario que reseñé al principio.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","My daughter is one of the youngest in her grade. She's just after the cutoff and fell right in the borderline area with her preschool kindergarten readiness assessment, so it was left up to us. We spent a lot of time considering it and finally decided to push her through to kindergarten. Kindergarten and first grade went pretty smoothly, but toward the end of first grade we noticed she was having problems inverting certain letters and numbers, and she was struggling with math. Second grade was a little bumpy, and we noticed she had to work twice as hard as her peers for the same results. With third grade came timed math tests, and I began to truly regret out decision to not do an extra year of preschool. She just couldn't do the tests. We practiced constantly, we reviewed, and she would feel so much pressure that she would get nauseous when the tests came. She worked so hard, but she never finished a single test. She was the only one in her class that didn't get to go to the pizza party celebrating completing the timed tests at the end of the year. It was heartbreaking. She started having nightmares about failing school and having to be held back, which continue to this day (seventh grade) despite the fact that she's catching up to her peers and has always had good grades. She feels stupid because she's had to work so much harder than everyone else. 

The differences are leveling out now that she's in middle school, but I do notice that she's less mature than other kids in her grade. She's blossomed in middle school, but the blows to her confidence still show. If I had it to do over again, I would have kept her in preschool that extra year. It's different for every kid, but that was our experience.","1409530059"

That is until one day while we were living in California and a mountain lion decided to come into the backyard.  My ex-husband and I woke up to this sound of what can only be described as a baby being tortured and killed in our living room.  Turns out Kitkat found her voice while trying to scare off the mountain lion through our sliding glass door.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was diagnosed with depression at age 12 so this has been an ongoing struggle. Made quite a few attempts in my teenage years that placed me in psyche wards and mental hospitals. The attempt that taught me the most and made me decide life is worth living, even if it is just for the people that love you, was when I was 19. Had recently graduated high school, thought I'd fallen in love for the first time, and had no plans for life. No job besides selling weed and trading drugs. No plans or care to further my education. The girl I thought I had loved and I had a very chaotic relationship fueled with drugs and constant cheating that we threw back into each others faces. I went on a huge binge one night that turned into a few days, popping 10 to 15 pills of klonopin, or xanax, or lorazapam, or oxycotton, whatever I had, falling asleep, waking up and doing it again. A couple days in I decided I couldn't live life that way and was so deep into the drugs that I couldn't fathom having any strength to make a change. Started driving to this bridge that overlooks the river not far from my hometown. There'd been a lot of suicides there and every time I went there with friends I morbidly imagined my own there, so it felt right. Well, after three days of taking at that point over 200 various pills I was in no shape to drive. Not far along the journey I got pulled over and was so freaked out I tried to take off, they tazed me, searched my car, impounded it, arrested me, spent 5 days in a holding cell sobering up, a couple more weeks in jail serving time, then eventually got out, went to treatment, got clean, went to school, became employed, and fell in real love with a wonderful woman. After that whole experience I decided that no matter how rough things get, no matter how bad my depression can get on any given day, life is worth it. 

TL;DR - Jail finally saved my life.","1409530061"

On the vast majority of pure OpenGL workloads, radeonsi has quite a ways to go, particularly on the newer Rx 2xx cards. r600 is in better shape, but it's still at least a little slower for most workloads despite being a lot more mature. Even if the performance was already identical there is still quite a lot of to do for OpenGL/OpenCL feature parity.

Everything turned out fine, zero complications.  We had extra monitoring just to keep an eye on it but it had no impact and everything was fine.

"ChristiEnts","t5_2tjjq","&gt;Very true. I feel like we had a good amount of people from my old church keepin people. Unfortunately the youth pastor that everyone really liked accepted a new job. So they have a new one now. I don't know what he's like though. Also, i feel working with teens might be one of the most rewarding and most important roles you can serve in the church.

There's an old saying, ""Lead an adult to Christ and you've saved a soul, lead a child to Him and you've saved a life""


&gt;Interesting. I had never used to get closer to God. I'd always felt like that would be completely contrary to the idea.

It was big with the hippies in the 70's who were tripping on LSD. There's still a lot of similar traditions out there. 

&gt;Ah, no wonder you don't fear such backlash. I live in FL so we still have some pretty ignorant people towards cannabis. I wish it wasn't so.

I just moved here from PSL, FL. I still have a lot of my punk rock attitudes so I simply don't care what they thought, and did I what I needed to do to survive. I live out loud, perhaps too loud sometimes, lol. But every church is issued their Sister Better-then-u who drives everyone nuts. Gotta ignore the morons. Jesus warned us that there'd be tares (weeds) growing among the wheat, or in other words; you can't keep the morons out. Besides if you could, you shouldn't, because Jesus is in the business of bringing changes about in people's lives; so they're in the right place...keep coming back, it works if you work it, lol. 

I do have to say that attitudes are changing in a big way. There's a ballot initiative this November in FL, VOTE ON IT! Get MMJ legal in FL. The CBD only law/program is a joke. It's amazing how other people take their cues from me when it comes to my MMJ use. If I talk about it in whispers, they follow suit and whisper back. If I act embarrassed, they get embarrassed for me. If I'm casual about it, and am able to share how it transformed my life, usually a dialogue can start. I guess it's becoming more of a curiosity then a taboo. Even Pat Robertson endorsed it.  Here's a great ruling by the Rabbis in New Jersey about the use of MMJ:
http://jstandard.com/content/item/22950 Arm yourself with knowledge. Let your attitude control the tone of the conversation. If you can't do this, learn how :)

&gt;You sound like an awesome youth minister. When you get someone like you that's so passionate about it, it can be very contagious.

Thank you, I serve at the pleasure of the King :) I'm passionate about it because I believe to an absolute certainty that it's true. I know what God has done in my life, and a man with an experience is never at the mercy of a man with an argument. 


&gt;Definitely! The times I felt closest to God were while playing drums and just really get into the music.

Music and worship is how you get the gates of heaven to open. Psalm 100:4 Old Pentecostal song, ""When the Praises Go Up, the Glory Comes Down""

Worst Thing That Happened to Someone Else: 

A bunch of redneck parents dragged their son who was *maybe* seven years old into the Haunted House, despite him being terrified. I jumped out all zombified, not realizing the next group included a small child, (we were alerted by motion sensors), and found myself face-to-face with a terrified little boy, frozen in place, tears running down his cheeks and piss running down his pant-legs.

i knew where a group of lace monitors would be in the morning sunning themselves on rocks and my local pub would always have plenty of tourist as our town was what some would class as the first stop on the way to the 'outback' 

so it was my common tactic to offer to show some of the girls i was interested in our local wildlife and the lace monitors would be our first stop

this one particular day i took this one german girl out to see them and she got it into her head that the were statues and not real so i suggested that she should poke one with a stick knowing it would be a laugh 

as she walks towards it as expected one of the larger ones turns towards her and give its warning hiss/growl but i did not expect her reaction she squeals turns and runs ... and she is not stopping

as i stand there watching her run splitting my sides laughing i didn't noticed he scream had spooked the entire group ... now lace monitors don't have the best eye sight and when spooked the run up the nearest thing they can climb

Would you consider letting the doctor arrive at it on their own without promoting? Your issues are the same with or without the BPD diagnosis. You could keep working them instead of pursuing that diagnosis. 

The critical point is honesty. Share your concerns with your pdoc. If they feel your concerns add up to BPD, they might add that to your chart and tell you. Alternatively, they might make a mental note but take no action because once BPD is on your chart everything changes. One clinician told me they don't share the diagnosis with the patient because many BPD patients use it as an excuse for worse behavior. It's unhelpful to know and especially for others to know. 

I know that sounds confusing, but it feels like you underestimate the seriousness of the ramifications that follow the BPD diagnosis. You could be better served by studying the different BPD therapies and seeing if they seem to help you at all. Look at CBT and more particularly DBT.

"arduino","t5_2qknj","&gt; interrupts proved to be harder work than just reading from the input pin in the loop() function.

Perfect conclusion! There are ways to poll an a variable controlled by an interrupt (you can probably think these up) so if the polling solution isn't reliable, we can deal with that.

&gt;In the interests of learning more about interpreting component datasheets, how could you tell that the sensor provides only HIGH and LOW output?

Datasheets are not always made by the most intelligible communicators (I.e. engineers), so they're usually not super clear. In this case saying the sensor could provide 5V 24mA max power, and the fact that's thats *all* it said, meant it didn't provide variable output (like a potentiometer). So, without even knowing the application of the sensor, it seemed like an ON/OFF only. Still, we had to make sure that the arduino wouldn't draw more than 24mA max. Setting a `pinMode(digitalPin, INPUT)` *automatically* turns on the internal resistor, which I believe might be 20MOhm, so we're in the clear.

&gt;Also, I was unsure about whether I'd need to add an inline resistor to the 5V pin on the motion sensor, because the datasheet said that the supply current should be 40mA max. I know that the Arduino can supply far more current than 40mA on the 5V rail, so what was there to stop the sensor being damaged by excess current, whereas an LED would be destroyed if not connected inline with a resistor?

This is an important point to understand. Are you familar with Ohms law? The current on the sensor is called out to make sure you are providing enough current, which the Arduino can do (100mA max?). It is **not** called out because you need to consider overpowering the sensor - you don't. This is what saying *5V max* was for. Since,  according to Ohms law, V=I * R, and the R of the sensor **cannot change**, the only way to make more I to damage the sensor is to make more V. Hooking it up without a resistor is correct.

In reality, with a known resistance, controlling V or I will obviously determine the other, but usually V is easier to control/measure. If you were to force 80mA through the sensor, it would probably create a potential difference between the power pins of 10V, which seems like it would damage the sensor","1409530077"

If it includes Welbeck's wages I think it would be a bargain, if not then I'd expect an option to buy in the future for that fee. Can't picture £5m for 1 season and then just leaving it at that, yet I can't see Welbeck committing long term to a team that atm could end up anywhere from 8th to 20th so maybe that's why we haven't bid the £15m they want.","1409530081"

""Buried deep in the federal government’s voluminous new tobacco regulations is a little-known cost-benefit calculation that public health experts see as potentially poisonous: the happiness quotient. It assumes that the benefits from reducing smoking — fewer early deaths and diseases of the lungs and heart — **have to be discounted by 70 percent to offset the loss in pleasure** that smokers suffer when they give up their habit. [emphasis added]

If this reasoning is followed it becomes much harder to justify some of the smoking limitations, that do not involve the health effects on non-smokers.  This does not please the anti-tobacco lobby, and gives ammunition to the tobacco lawyers.  Definitely worth a read.

So yes, you helped England and France in particular a great deal, and fucked over Germany, to a degree Austria, definitely countries like Hungary, Poland and Romania(ask them about Ceaușescu).

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The Kurds have consistently shown that they do not overreach. They'll be happy with the land in Iraq, especially since Israel and Turkey have said they would recognize an independent Kurdistan. Add the US being an ally and the fact that the Kurds have never had it so good, I'm betting you'll be wrong.

The extremists you are thinking of already come from existing countries, they dream of much more, they want an empire, to recreate an old golden age. And they have many rich like-minded billionaires willing to support their cause. The Kurds will be happy to have a defendable country for once.

I imagine there is a risk of inter-Kurdish competition for power, but they seem to have resolved such differences in the near past so I think the risk is small. There's too much to lose, being surrounded by people who have opposed their desire for independence for centuries.

I think overall the Kurds are much less likely to bite the hand that feeds/helps them (the West right now) than extremist groups. They've been burned by the US before (after the first Iraq war, not getting help in their failed uprising), but they remained strong allies anyways.

At the time, one of them was utterly worthless in my class.  I ended up dismissing him from the program.  It was absolutely no surprise to find out he'd been involved in drug violence and retribution.  Shot a guy in the back four times.  Off to prison, scum.  The world is better off without a person like him.

The other one...  that one was more difficult.  I would see him all day long with a fairly happy demeanor.  He struggled a bit, but he really worked hard for me and was an intelligent guy.  I knew he had problems with alcohol.  I knew he had a temper, but I never saw it.  He beat his girlfriend to death on a country road one night because she was threatening to go to the police about something he'd done in the past.  When the police went to find him the following morning, the driver's side of his car was covered with blood spatter.

I hated to see him take the path he took.  But he made that decision to take the life of another and throw his own away.  

There was nothing but assistance, training, and opportunity all around both of these young men at the time they committed their crimes.  In that respect, I have no sympathy for either of them.","1409530090"

As for the other stuff, I had a gym membership where I would shower/shave/use the bathroom. Where I lived was also right next to a wash, so there was a lot of empty space if necessary. ","1409530092"

&gt;__Göbekli Tepe__ (Turkish: [ɡøbe̞kli te̞pɛ],  ""Potbelly Hill"" ) is an archaeological site at the top of a mountain ridge in the [Southeastern Anatolia Region](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeastern_Anatolia_Region) of [Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey), approximately 6 km (4 mi) northeast of the town of [Şanlıurfa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9Eanl%C4%B1urfa). The [tell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tell) has a height of 15 m (49 ft) and is about 300 m (984 ft) in diameter.  It is approximately 760 m (2,493 ft) [above sea level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Above_mean_sea_level). It has been excavated by a German archaeological team that was under the direction of [Klaus Schmidt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klaus_Schmidt_(archaeologist\)) from 1996 until his death in 2014.

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","""Fairly"" is a completely subjective thing. You just have to sit down with everyone and have the conversation. Ideally, you would have a lawyer guide the conversation, discuss what each member is contributing and what they are receiving in terms of an equity stake.

These things are defined in the company's incorporation documents, explicitly stating who is a stakeholder, who is an officer/manager, what their responsibilities are, and their initial contribution.

It's possible to do all the paperwork yourself. However, if you are not putting in the same amount of money then I would highly recommend that a lawyer draw up the paperwork.

If they are putting up tens of thousands of dollars then it is in everyone's interest to have a neutral party oversee the process. This way, you're better protected if someone claims afterword that person-A does not have a full/equal share.","1409530098"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Film/TV/Theatre has a huge barrier to entry - in terms of money, people and organization, to produce something that people will watch.

Game development, has since the dawn of programmable computers, been possible with just one person, who enjoys what they are doing even if they never finish - who can basically make a ""pilot"" in the way a TV studio does, in the space of a week or two.

YouTube is possibly a source of the best games journalism - TotalBiscuit's WTF series is one I can rely on, partly because he goes out of his way to talk about stuff that's not inherently about the game: silly things like ""Does it have rebindable keys? Does it let you choose meaningful graphics settings?"". Moreso, I feel that individual personalities are better for games than ""magazine""-style uniformity: you can really get an impression of what games the person presenting likes, and their experience with the genre/series. I say this, because Johnny BlOPS2 will really know why CoD:Advance Warfare might be good but won't understand the intricacies of why trinkets make a substantial impact on League of Legends - though his opinion of League of Legends in Season 4 can still be interesting to people.

The Video Game BAFTAs are a thing -- broadcast on Twitch this year from what I can tell, and also on a digital TV channel, though they are largely an industry event. BAFTAs are the British Academy for Film and Television awards. There are separate ceremonies for Film/TV (think Oscars/Emmys) and now more recently video games.

I'd like to ask a few things in return though - to what extent can you trust reviews of anything? The vast majority of things I've actually enjoyed watching or playing have also had the recommendations of friends I share opinions with, and even that hasn't always been 100% reliable. 

Is there not both TV, film and games which could sorta be described as brain-rotting? It's inherently exaggeration in the context of modern science, but the 50s mother may not have seen Jeremy Kyle coming, but it is probably the pinnacle of car-crash TV. Farmville and Candy Crush may just be up there with Jeremy Kyle for me.

Finally, while the potential for negative social interaction online may be equal to in-person interaction, would you not agree that in reality it seems to happen more often? Culture is loosely defined as ""The sum of attitudes, customs, and beliefs that distinguishes one group of people from another"".

When people talk of a culture, they're generalizing at best, stereotyping at worst - but even taking account of it innocently, people tend to be dicks online. We *are* the culture, me, you, everyone here and I feel the reputation of gamers would be worse if not for us - even if it isn't good either way.","1409530098"

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","I used to wonder why I always bled during anal sex.. Then I found out that I had external hemorrhoids (I'm 19 years old). Since then, I've found a few things that work very well.

1. Flax seed is your best friend. Eat 2-3 teaspoons a day; I like it in Nature's Path organic Hemp or Pumpkin seed cereal, which has lots of fiber as well. It will soften your stools and make you more regular.
2. DRINK LOTS OF WATER!! As much as you can in one day (at least 8 cups, or 4 tall glasses).
3. When you defecate, try as hard as you can not to strain, and wipe with warm moist toilet paper (you can also try cold, but this is uncomfortable for me).
4. If flare-ups are particularly bad, buy dried Witch Hazel at your local natural products store, and make a strong ""tea"" from it to apply when it cools down. You can keep it for 2-3 days before it goes bad (you know by the smell when there is mold in it). I usually make half a cup and it's more than enough. It will shrink the hemorrhoids like magic.
5. NO PROCESSED OR FAST FOOD. It constipates you for days, I'm not even kidding, and aggravates your condition. It's best to make all your food yourself at home, even if it's a little on the unhealthy side it's still 1000x better for you than any fast food.
6. When having anal sex, use LOTS of lube and start with fingers (very important). My favorite is the Durex lube with Aloe Vera, but any quality lube is good.

My boyfriend was recently on vacation (he lives 800km away) and came to see me at my camp, and I had anal sex for the first time in 6 months. And for the first time, even though it hurt at first because he is quite big (about 9 inches), I DID NOT BLEED. At all. In the 2+ years that I've been with him, I always bled when we had sex and this was my first time where I didn't bleed.

My family doctor was beyond useless when it came to helping me deal with my hemorrhoids, he wrote me a prescription for Preparation H and for him that was it - the cure-all, end-all of hemorrhoids so I basically had to learn how to live with it on my own with the help of the internet. I have never used the Preparation H that I got from the pharmacy because I honestly don't need it anymore.

Hopefully my tips help you out some. You're definitely not alone. (:","1409530100"

"bikecommuting","t5_2tbmq","Another thing to think about is the number of motorists that you encounter on a road commute.  If 100 random cars pass you per day and 1/1,000 motorists is a jerk that will do something stupid, then about once every week or two you will have a bad encounter.  Those are just arbitrary numbers, but the point is that if you are exposed to a large number of cars even a very low ratio of jerks can still make for a bad experience.

With that being said, I haven't ever had this happen to me on a bike.  I have had some people pass a bit too close, but this seems to be from inadvertence or not wanting to get too near to the center lane than malice.  It isn't rare to see bikes and cars operating in a reckless manner though.  The only intentionally malicious acts of road rage that I have seen have been car on car and they are, thankfully, quite rare.

If i had to make a list

Peanut Butter
(i'm known as peanut butter queen, used to have a jar under my bed)

Banana

Oatmeal

Sweet Potatoes(I love sweet potatoes)

Sushi

Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

Basically I used to have these every morning for breakfast. I never lost any weight, so I can't go back oatmeal, i'll moderate banana's &amp; PB 3 times a month. That's pretty much it, Keto has killed all my cravings. I cut out cheese, but plan on bringing it back once I reach maintenance.

"communism","t5_2qolz","&gt;Since the amount of aggregate profit is equal to the amount of aggregate surplus value, these individual deviations of price of production from value cancel each other out. The total surplus value, which is completely determined by surplus labor, is simply redistributed so that each capitalist receives an amount of surplus value determined by the average rate of profit, rather than the actual amount of surplus value his own workers produced. ... You can see how the same amount of surplus value that goes unreceived by capitals of less-than-average organic composition (c/v) is received by capitals of greater-than-average organic composition. 

Sooooo to simplify this to a ridiculous degree (I'm still a Marx noob), an example of this would be if, say, computers are overvalued, so a capitalist in a different industry, whose production process obviously involves computers, will see his profits fall below the general rate because he's paying so much for computers. But the computer capitalist will capture a profit that's greater than the general rate by the same amount (for obvious reasons). Am I getting that about right?

And in the long run, won't the higher profits in computers lead to increased investment in computers, which will bring the rate of profit down, leading the other capitalist above to see his profits rise *back* to the general rate of profit since he can now buy cheaper computers?

So in addition to deviations in rates of profits cancelling each other out in the immediate term, don't they also flatten out in the long run due to transfers of capital between industries? In other words aren't such deviations inherently temporary anyway?","1409530114"

Fast forward a few years and he is wanted for breaking into a house, raping and woman and either brutally beating or killing her husband. Also he is linked to a lot more murders outside of my town. The police get a hint that he is at his mothers house so they go there and he comes running out shooting at the cops. He obviously didn't make it to jail. I can't remember the kids name or I would link the article.

Also this girl would lie and say her sisters kids were her own. She would take pictures of this random family on MySpace (god, this is so old) and find the ones without the wife/mother and post it to her own page saying it was her husband and kids. She just lied about everything and one day someone found out. 

Once again, fast forward to after high school. She is in the news for Child pornography (later we found out she also had sex with the one child.) Here is that article http://gothamist.com/2012/09/11/new_jersey_woman_pleads_to_sexual_i.php

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","At this point, I'd say no, it's never going to get fixed. The most simple solution would be to give the bald head some sort of basic hair texture, so it at least looks like you have a bit of hair (though this would look off with most hair styles as you'd suddenly get short hair whenever you put a hat on). The most complex solution would be to customize each hair for each headpiece, ensuring that defining pieces of the hair show while nothing clips through. That's a lot of work, not even counting the Gem Store hairstyles. A middle of the road solution would be custom hair models dependent on length. If your character has hair of a certain length, then the hair that shows under the helm will look like it's pulled up under, or tied up into a bun, or something. Custom hairstyles not necessarily matching existing ones, but look they would if someone did their hair up to wear a hat or something.

Any of that is a decent amount of work, and if they didn't want to do that at or before release, there's no chance we'll see something like this in the future, sadly.","1409530117"

So long as they give an accurate description of the effect and say that the trailer was edited, I'm all right.  But I will still rely on reviews and endorsements to make an educated decision about if I want to buy the product.

I'll be disappointed if the effect is different from what was shown in the trailer, but that really depends on how fake the trailer is.

------

A nice example of a good, edited trailer is the one for [CamConCoincidencia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pD5-Md7sFkY&amp;channel=DanAndDave)  
It is highly edited because it's pretty much a self working trick.  If it were performed fully in the trailer, lots of magicians would be able to figure it out.  (I know I would.)  But the trailer tells you it is edited.  And I trust R. Paul Wilson, and lots of people reviewed it positively.  It is a wonderful and powerful trick, but lots of people wouldn't buy it if they knew how it was done from the trailer.","1409530118"

Now it's a bit bigger, and spreading to the other side of his tail.

He doesn't even acknowledge that it's there. Doesn't itch. Is not raised. Literally just looks to be the fur. No bumps or anything around it or on the skin.

He eats Fromm Gold food and he's eaten this his whole life. Due to his sensitive stomach he gets rice and boiled chicken occasionally if he gets into something that he shouldn't. But outside of that he really doesn't eat table scraps.

Any information or ideas would be awesome! We have a family vet, but since it has been around for the last year, hasn't bothered him, his eating, or his playfulness (he's a basket case - goes from 0-psycho in 2 seconds) I haven't thought much of it!","1409530124"

I realize it's not going to be a flip of the switch type thing, but we have to start somewhere, and I think we have to start by consciously building the world we want rather than doing the same things as always and hoping it'll appear someday. I honestly think that most people want a peaceful world, and so it shouldn't be as much of an issue to mobilize the resources for it as it is (except for the fact that the people who don't want it are often in power!)","1409530129"

"swtor","t5_2qxih","Here here! GSF gets far too much hate. Build matters but a good pilot can get by with a stock ship. All my guildmates that I drag with me inevitably complain that they can't compete because they don't have anything unlocked. Until I show them how it's possible on an alt. Concentrate on learning how to control your ship and developing your ""twitch"" before you worry about scoring points. That being said my only other piece of advice would be for newbies with a gaming mouse. Most gaming mouses come with their sensitivity way to high. I couldn't keep an opponent in frame let alone put hits on them when I first started.  I cut my dpi in half and the very next match I had not only my first touch, but 2 kills and 5 assists! My second general tip would be to learn how and when to switch your power pools. Doesn't matter how accurate you are or how good of a pilot you are, if you are out of power when it counts, I will kill you.  
 A few tips for picking ships: most newbies I speak with like the gunship starting out. You're stationary, you hut like a truck, and it's easier to put laser to paint. You're also slow and not very maneuverable so use LOS to your advantage.  
  
Strikefighters: faster than a gs and tougher than a scout, good ship to learn the art of the dogfight as they're a little easier to line up targets with. You won't outrun a good scout and the reduced speed makes it easier for gs to target you, and bombers will make you their bitch so stay away!  
  
I recommend the nova to new players, it's the fastest ship in the game and can be built to have engine power for days. Unfortunately the armor is paper thin, but speed will help you get out of most problems.   It's the best ship to learn to fly as the speed makes any course corrections exaggerated,  and once you switch classes you'll notice how much easier everything else is to fly. ","1409530131"

From what I've seen of him at Roma &amp; with the US, he is a box to box player.  He's not a true DM like we had in Laba, i.e someone who sits in front of the defense and rarely (if ever) makes runs forward.  I'm sure he can play that role reasonably well, but I don't think that's ever been his #1 role.  He's usually the first midfielder to press the ball carrier, and has another player cover the space behind him.

I mean at a certain point this all just becomes semantics, but I think the truth lies somewhere in the middle.  He's not a player who should be playing as advanced as we have him, but he's also not a true sit in front of the back line defensive mid.","1409530132"

We can confidently say that was a really stupid, misinformed decision.

It's a shame you didn't stop doing it because you were harming yourself.

&gt; I tried it last week and it just made me tired, have jaw shakes and make me feel messy, I put it down to having bad shit.

How are you able to come to this conclusion?  What did your test results say?

&gt; I went back and do some more and the same thing happened

Well, you can't draw any conclusions without the test kit information.

"AncientCoins","t5_2wmz0","The pictures were great considering the wear of the coin. I'm not the best at attribution so others may come in and correct this but I believe, based mostly off the reverse that this coin can be attributed as:

Trajan AE Sestertius. 106 AD. IMP CAES NERVAE TRAIANO AVG GER DAC P M TR P COS V P P, laureate bust right, draped left shoulder / SPQR OPTIMO PRINCIPI S-C, Victory standing right, holding stylus &amp; resting hand on shield inscribed VIC DAC &amp; set on palm tree. Cohen 542cf.

[If this is the correct attribution here is a picture of the same coin with more detail](http://wildwinds.com/coins/ric/trajan/RIC_0527.jpg)

RIC lists a 527v (the one I linked above is 527) that's basically the same coin but with the 527v it looks like Victory's wings extend much further below the S in S C. 527v is dated to 103. To me, it looks like your Victory has her wings more even with the S in the 527 reverse.

Like I said, the pictures looked great to me but I personally have very shaky hands so I usually stack a couple books near my bedside lamp (4-5 inches tall) and lay my coin on a white sheet of paper. Then I lay my phone on the books so all I have to do is hit the shutter button. I would say it does a fairly good job of eliminating most of the blur I would get normally.  ","1409530136"

We had lost 6 towers, taken 2 of theirs, and kill score was 49-49. We were losing, bad. So I figured I would start messing around instead. I was chasing after enemies for no reason, running into 3v1 match ups knowing I would die. Well somehow we ended up winning. The other team was so focused on us they let our minions in.

He needs full support, and structure. I kind of want to say military school because that would provide the structure, and potentially help him make friends (since I imagine there's not a lot of friends who hang out with him) because they are all stuck there together. But...he needs some behavioral assistance. I don't know if there are any boarding schools that do this, but he needs to be away and under the care of specialists-- not institutionalized and forgotten, but institutionalized and treated.

It might not end up helping, but as he is currently-- it's better than just leaving him as is.

My two cents :) Loads of Eastern Orthodox books have stuff on demons and how to guard your thoughts against them. Check out ""Our Thoughts Determine Our Lives"", ""The Young Man, The Gurus, And Elder Paisios"", and C.S. Lewis-The Screwtape Letters. The hocus-pocus demon stuff you see on TV isnt really what happens-if you want to see what an exorcism looks like, youtube Ostrov amd a scene of the exorcism from that movie should pop up. Its in russian but theres subtitles. 

I dont know about other churches, but the Eastern Orthodox talk about demons pretty often. Theyre just little obnoxious things trying to make you mess up. They pop up sometimes, lots of priests see them and deal with them and just go on about their day.","1409530141"

TouchWiz (Samsung's ""skin"" or modification of stock Android) is a downright terrible user experience, especially for people coming from iOS. Personally, I would recommend either a Nexus or Google Play Edition (if available for your carrier... and of course if you can afford a GPE) or an HTC or Motorola device. Motorola only modifies stock Android slightly, and HTC's skin is all very polished. Unfortunately I can't speak for LG or Sony devices.

That said, if you're tech savvy you can always root the Note 4 (if a method become available) or see if they release a Google Play Edition Note 4 (doubtful).

Edit: Specifically, I'd recommend the HTC One M8 (main drawback is the camera) or wait until September 4th and see what the Moto X+1 has to offer. If you're looking for a bigger screen, the LG G3 has received really good reviews. And, honestly, I think the iPhone 6 that should be announced on September 9th is worth a look as well.","1409530142"

"SSBPM","t5_2u3tn","I think that what he's trying to say is that Smash already had some momentum from 64, so making Melee was taking from what was before but tuning it to a refined level. In the sense that 64 is a deep fighter all by itself, it's a good, if only in the rough, fighting game. It rewards fast plays and skill.

Melee kept that but a million times smother. Added some needed features and overall tweaks.

Brawl was the mistake in that it stopped being a fighter in the sense that it no longer was fast or rewarded offensive play (to the same extent).

Brawl had no need to be what it ended up being. Not to mention delayed a ridiculous amounts of time for a single player mode that I only played once. Twice for the completion, and it was very unsatisfactory.

That's  why there's two valid points:

""Melee the happy accident"". I've never bought it, I always felt it had more thought put into it to make it a competitive game. If anything 64 was the demon child that was able to work by sheer luck.

Then there's the other

""Brawl is an accident"" I agree with this view more. Brawl was made like that, no accident, but it was an accident to the fanbase. A spit in the face to the most hardcore lovers of your game because you feel that your game shouldn't play in one way. Nevermind that the casual give two shits about competitiveness.

Sakurai fails when he says that he needs to make a game where that's easy for everyone. That was Melee, dawg. Yeah, it had some quirks, but it didn't matter. If you wanted to get good you overcame this hurdles. The rest of the casuals will almost never compete against a pro, so why in the hell destroy the engine?

My final nail in the coffin for brawl is the lack of momentum. It's just not acceptable. In Melee you will go farther by running, then jumping. In Brawl and apparently in Smash 4 as well, your distance after jump is already decided. How do you shit on your own physics engine and say that this game is better?

Sakurai is right there with Sakamoto as the two guys from Nintendo who have made me the most angry through the years.","1409530143"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;You're splitting hairs. These are criminals who purchased guns on the street illegally and used them in murders. There is a black market for firearms all over the world, criminals will purchase them, and use them in crimes.

No, I'm not. It is an incredibly important point. The argument isn't that gun control will result in criminals having fewer guns because the criminals will follow the law, it's that black markets aren't infinitely powerful, so you need to look at the logistics of the problem to be solved. You can smuggle things into a city from a different place in the same country a lot more easily than you can from one country to another. Obviously cities aren't going to have effective gun control.

&gt; but it didn't just appear overnight after guns were banned

Nor would I ever expect it to anywhere. It's a long term solution, not a short term one. Again, we're considering the logistics of how laws affect criminals, not treating either laws or criminals as a magical force through which things occur.

&gt;Their crime statistics are lower due to their culture, not specifically their gun control.

So isn't propagating the culture of promoting gun use therefore, by your own argument, propagating a culture that results in many more people being killed?","1409530144"

I can't make the leap to say it is along the same lines as racism, or homophobia, because those are innate rather than cultural.  It's simply the dominant culture rejecting the counter-culture.  It IS however a sexual counter-culture, which is why some may feel so strongly compared to others. 

 A high percentage of people are not comfortable with their own sexuality so they reject and criticize others that are foreign to them (kind of why it is easy to be homophobic even if you were never ""taught"" to be homophobic, but if you are only exposed to heterosexuality as a child)","1409530149"

So I'm able to get an interview for the job and it's going really well. Then one of the interviewers (there were three) tells me we're moving on to the next part of the interview and tells me that I'm supposed to go out into the hall, create three different colonial characters, come back into the interviewing room and give an introduction as each character.

When I went out into the hall, I nearly had a full-blown panic attack.  I hadn't done improv of any kind in years, not to mention I knew barely anything about colonial history/ culture.  Running out the door without saying anything to the interviewers felt very tempting at that point. But I pushed through my panic attack, came back into the interview room, and bombed all three of my characters (one of the interviewers even corrected something I said midway through my introduction).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I've worked in low income, inner city schools for five years. I've had several students go on to prison -- arrested for everything from assault to robbery to driving under the influence. Many of the students I've taught have been involved in gangs or just live in very dangerous neighborhoods. Yes, there were absolutely ""warning signs"" that they might commit a violent crime. 

But for many, it was only a matter of time. I'm not saying that they are predisposed to commit crime or they are bad kids. But the adults that live in these areas prey on high school students to take the fall for them. They get them to do small, petty crimes for a little extra money -- money the kid often uses to buy necessities for their families. Then the crimes escalate. 

I'm not making excuses for them, because they know the difference between right and wrong. I'm just highlighting some of the situations that lead to these crimes. Not many middle-class suburban kids have to say ""no I won't sell drugs for you"" to some dead beat adult multiple times a week on their walk home from school. 

I think the surprising thing for me is how normal and wonderful these future criminals were. Every kid I've ever taught (and I've taught hundreds) has some spark, some redeeming factor, that makes them unique and interesting. It is heart breaking to see children get wrapped up in situations that are dangerous, especially when they see no way out. ","1409530155"

You're right about the cliff thing: there's a lot of variables. It's a hard subject to speak of without forgetting something. But tell me, is it not already the case, in much of the world, that certain instances of negligence are indeed criminal? Let's say I don't contend that absolutely any refusal to help someone is criminal, but that it has the possibility of being criminal, depending on the circumstances, which are open for interpretation, &amp; that this is the job of some sort of court system to decide on. (This is the same court system, by the way, which would decide that the deal we made with the cliff-hanger wherein he becomes our slave would not be enforced.)

Could we then go on to say that opposition to wage labor, rent, interest, or anything else of that variety, is just a matter they would want settled in court? That they long for a society wherein such conventions are seen as cruelly exploitative &amp; thus unenforceable, the same way our slave contract with the cliff-hanger would be?","1409530156"

log(x) = log_10 (x)

Also, ""logarithm"" can be thought of as a fancy name for ""exponent"". So with:

log(x) = 0.75

The **base** is 10, and the **exponent** is 0.75, the only other term left is x, so the above equation can be written as:

10^(0.75) = x

Do the same thing with the other problem, only when we write ""ln(x)"", it means that the base of the logarithm is the number ""e"".

ln(x) = log_e (x)

Whey protein is:

Working from [here](http://examine.com/supplements/Whey+Protein/#summary1-1) it seems that:

* beta-lactoglobulin is around 18.4 kDa
* alpa-lactalbumin is around 14.2 kDa
* bovine serum albumen is around 66.5 kDa
* immunoglobins are around 150 kDa

These numbers are all too large to allow for penetration or effective adsorption onto hair.  At most, they will form a sort of temporary film over the hair, though again simply pouring it over your hair doesn't seem to be an ideal way to allow those films to set up.","1409530158"

"math","t5_2qh0n","Most (all?) interesting applications of calculus involve integration (roughly adding an infinite amount of infinitely small numbers), which is unfortunately only taught at the end. It is totally understandable if your daughter feels disenfranchised by her course. But calculus is useful and beautiful. Some examples:

* **Finding the roots of polynomials**. Give your daughter a pen and paper. Tell her to give you a decent rational approximation of the square root of 7. Can she do it in a reasonable amount of time? A famous application of derivatives that is sometimes given in calculus courses is an algorithm called [Newton's method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), which allows you to find the root of any polynomial very quickly. With a pen and paper, your daughter could get *dozens* of digits of the square root of 7 within *minutes*!

* **Calculate logarithms by hand**: Yes, you can do this. And quite accurately too. The idea is that approximating a logarithm reduces to a problem of quadrature. The function defined by [this function](http://mathb.in/19638) can be proven without fancy calculus to be logarithmic (it has a special name -- the *natural logarithm*). This means you can calculate a logarithm by calculating the area of a region with one side being a curve. The quickest way to handle this logarithm is to first get a polynomial approximation (a nontrivial process) and use reverse differentiation and the fundamental theorem of calculus. [Here is an example](http://mathb.in/19640).

* **The area of a circle**. The circumference of a circle is, by definition, two times pi times the radius. To get the area of a circle, imagine increasing the radius by a small amount dr. Then the area should increase by an amount approximately equal to the circumference times dr. Integrating gives you the area of a circle: pi times the radius squared.

* **Or better yet, the hypervolume of a hypersphere**. A hypersphere is to four dimensions of space as a sphere is to three dimensions as a circle is to two dimensions. The formula for the volume of a sphere can be found by slicing the sphere up like an onion. That is, we add up the areas of the circular cross sections to get the volume of a sphere. And by adding, I mean integration. In the same way, you can cut up a hypersphere into an infinity of spheres and add their volumes to get the hypervolume of a hypersphere.

* **The factorial of a fraction**. [This formula is true](http://mathb.in/19641). However, n must be a positive whole number for the right side to be defined. However, the integral of the left side can be evaluated for fractional powers too. That's right, you can (sort of) define the factorial of a fraction! For example, the ""factorial"" of negative one half is the square root of pi. These weird calculations have applications in probability and statistics when studying approximations of Poisson processes.","1409530159"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Well the thing is a lot the times it was Curse trying to take a fight, for example the dragon fight where LMQ were all in the pit, Akali goes in by herself (don't remember if she got a Lulu ulti or not), Maokai stuns her, Braum peel, exhaust, Yasuo ults him (which was probably overkill).

And even without the peel from Maokai, Braum ulti + double exhaust means that Voyboy's pretty much never going to be able to kill Kog'maw. The biggest issue is that LMQ forced big  5v5s rather than having an extended laning phase or pink ward fights/buff invades. Akali excels in skirmishes, she's not that great in a full on 5v5 unless she's she's extremely ahead. Curse also built a comp in which Akali didn't really have a dive buddy at all, it was just Voy going in with a Lulu ulti against double exhaust and tons of  CC and pink wards that render his twilight shroud useless.

1. **Lower ping**. I could at least play some games on dial-up (such as WoW) with pings around 100ms.  The lowest I've ever tested was 680ms to google on satellite, normally hovers around 900ms. That's 7-8x more latency.

2. **Lower cost**. Dialup is $10/mo, satellite is $70.

3. **No usage caps**. Satellite gives me 10gb/mo. Dialup is unlimited. Granted I could never hit 10gb on 56k even if I downloaded 24/7, it's still a valid point.

4. **100% uptime**. My satellite goes out a few times a week when there are heavy storms (there were a lot this year in Michigan). It is also affected by power outages. Dialup is unaffected by weather, and works even when there is no power, as it goes through the phone lines, allowing me to use my laptop (which has a built-in 56k modem) to go online.","1409530166"

Second, how do you draw the line in the first place without doing something like this? It's not like a river which exists whether we're here or not.

&gt;If one is going to make a firm distinction - an absolute barrier, with things neatly lined up, either to one side or the other - then the line that one uses to make that distinction must be as firm as the distinction ones wishes to use it to make.

It seems like people do make those firm distinctions and stick to them. Those people determine what is or is not aggression and seem to stick to it. It's easy to see otherwise when you read a lot of different individuals with different interpretations and application discussing what is aggression and what is not.

&gt;To make a firm distinction based on a slippery and ever-shifting line is to invite error and abuse.

What is an error when applying the NAP? Do you know the objectively correct application of the NAP or interpretation of what it means? We're talking about a group of individuals with differing values and interests applying a vague principle using a loosely defined structure (i.e., property rights).

It's impossible for the NAP to do what you think it should do to not be useless. That point is fine, but you have defined it into uselessness through your expectations and your characterizations of how it's used. There are many other understandings of both the NAP and the expectations of the NAP which show it to be useful.","1409530166"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","I don't know if this is directly related to your problem, but…

FFXIV has a really weird relationship with sound devices. In many (most) games, you can select which output device you want, or just use 'default'. Then in windows you can set your default device as preferred.

The interesting thing is that if you change the default device in windows, the sound changes too, or at least in Windows 8 it does. I recall 7 being a bit flaky.

Anyway, the behavior is sort of like the app is telling Windows 'hey, play this sound to the default device, whatever that is' and then Windows handles it from there.

FFXIV behaves differently. It seems as though when it launches, it asks Windows 'hey, what's the default sound device?' When windows tells it, it says 'okay, play this sound to device X then.' This has two problems:

1. If your default device is wrong, or not present when you start the game, then FFXIV will be playing sound to the wrong device until you quit it and restart it.

2. If your default device goes away, it doesn't fall back to the next device; you just straight up don't get sound anymore (because your device is gone, and maybe FF doesn't recognize it when it comes back).

Whatever the underlying technical reason, the practical upshot is that if your audio device goes away, for even a fraction of a second, then as far as FFXIV is concerned it's gone forever.

The reason I explained all this is that it sounds to me as though this is what's happening; your device may be getting disconnected and poof, gone forever. Other games just go with the default device so disappearing for a fraction of a second is fine because windows handles it for them. FF is weird and gives up instantly.

My suggestion would be to check all your connections. If you're using a hub, try without. Try a different hub or different port. Plug directly into your computer. If you're already plugging into your computer, try a different port or try with a hub (most monitors have ten these days). Mix things up.

It may also be a problem with the headset itself, the USB cord, etc. take a look over it all in good light and see what the condition is. Frayed or crimped wiring could cause the problem. See if it happens when you move a certain way (e.g. when you tilt your head down does it bend the cable and cause a problem?) See if there's anything you do that could be triggering it and that might tell you what is happening.","1409530168"

Since E max is generally preferred on top Wukong (and jungle), having only 10% armour shred early makes laning against something like Mundo or Nasus who rushes armour (and maybe even takes excessive armour in runes) a lot harder to deal with. Your level 6 isn't as good, and you can't assist in ganks as much either (as the shred helps your jungler as well). The small damage reduction on his ult really wasnt a big deal.

The nerfs definitely hurt him, and I moved away from playing him and moved to jungle, but I'm back to maining him top and I still find him really strong for soloQ. He doesn't have many terrible matchups (and those that are aren't really meta picks), and his snowballing is incredible. Over my last 27 games (thats what lolking shows me) I'm 18-9 with a 9.7/3.8/7 KDA.

I AGREE.

I am from the east coast and I will tell you right now, if you don't respond to RSVPs, you will be contacted multiple times until you do. However, most of the time that isn't necessary because people actually reply (and reply HONESTLY) usually by the deadline.  Also, if you RSVP '""yes"" and are unable to make it because something came up, you contact the person handling RSVPs (usually the bride's Mom or maybe the couple) and you tell them.  It's common courtesy.  I have definitely noticed a lack of it here.    

It's the one thing I have yet to figure out about Seattle.  WHY? Why the ""Seattle No"".  JUST SAY NO.  It's not hard and it's extremely rude to ignore people once you've decided you want to say no but don't have the balls to actually say NO.  /End rant. (this crap makes my blood boil)
 
I assume a lot of people in this sub-reddit would love to disagree with me, but I think your story is a great rep resentation about how social things work around Seattle.   

But hey, if you need someone to fill up a few of those vacant spots... you know who to PM. I have awesome RSVP etiquette.","1409530171"

For all the kids, not just the sick ones either.   We can significantly help societies really mend their wounds this way.  

But guess what?  Social services in the schools are amongst the first to be cut.  Teachers get cut too.  The people that stay and never get cut?  That's right......the administration.

Have any of you tired SIM leagues? I recently joined one and it's been great. It has been a successful league, running since 2010(18 seasons) with over 200 active members. 

What you do is:

* Create a player(You don't have to be crazy active to be good)
* Add points to this players stats. (You can earn points by doing various tasks ranging from no effort at all to a decent amount of effort)
* You will be eligible for the junior draft which takes place in a week or two. 
* You will then be drafted to the big leagues after you complete your junior season.
* Two games are simmed daily, all necessary stats are posted immediately after the sim.
* Lots of fun extras like All-star games, HoF, Fantasy Leagues with created players, Articles on your player, and lots more.

Here is the link if you are interested 
theshl.b1.jcink.com/index.php?act=idx

Go to the ""Getting Started"" forum to get started! You will have a mentor contact you after joining to guide you through the league. I am a mentor and if you let me know that you sign up I'll try and claim you, if not I can still help out. 


Would be awesome if you could put hatrrick44 as recruiter when creating your player.

They stated they were having issues with some of the command languages that AMD uses. They fixed that issue shortly thereafter. At this point its simply an optimization issue. As even Intel CPUs underperform. Its only really and issue for those with AMD CPUs however because it puts them below 30fps in most cases. Even my 3570k @4.5ghz and a 770gtx doesn't hold 40fps in raids.

If I was using a fx 8350 with 60% of the single core performance vs the 3570k it would make sense that I would see under 30fps. That's all this AMD issue is at this point. There is no magic fix for a game that uses TONS of CPU power, other than streamlining the processes.

"dota2loungebets","t5_2xomz","Heres to a new month indeed, we start fresh and im so happy that i bet on c9! sorry to all my followers who followed my beginning bets :( i hope i can recover your rares today. Most of these are pretty obvious matchups but lets give ana anylsis anyway.

VP vs (Na'vi) - although they have lost to the amazah c9 eternal envy doom, this should be an easy matchup as this is a best of 2, sure vp have been doing amazing but na'vi are just on another level with their two new players. Im starting to believe that dendi is finally getting into the meta (besides razor) and yeah this should be a stomp imo ( big bet)

Arrow vs (Johnny) - First of all, johnny has not gotten his revenge yet, however this is a best of 3 and he should be able to get his revenge finally. Arrow did beat johnny 1-0 last time they met but they had some bad picks in the draft, i hope that winter did some replay watching and got his analysis together so that they can finally beat ddz and arrow overall. ( medium)

Navi.US vs (Empire) - Empire are still pretty good without vanskor and well nar'vi has not been impressing me as they have only been vsing t2 teams (the games i have watched) which include the bounty hunter challenge and etc. this is a best of 3 and well empire should win this easily ( big bet)

Navi vs Alliance - This is just going to be so fanbased as there are way more navi fans than alliance, ive got proven wrong by alliance as they dont actually suffer with egm and stuff and maybe ill bet on them however im gonna check the navi vs vp matchup and see if it is an actual full stomp, if it is then ill bet on navi most likely (small bet)

DUZA vs (PR) - man its been awhile since ive seen DUZA but this is like a matchup of the titans once again, if i remember (last year) DUZA beat PR last time they beat them i think it was 1-0 if i remember. However this is a best of 3 and i doubt that PR will throw and i doubt that DUZA will go medusa and fail with 3 rapiers(if that was the game i remember) (Big bet)

Empire vs Tinker - Tinker got smashed against navi and the lineup was wierd coming out from starladder, however if this is a best of three i guess its kind of safe to go on tinker, i just miss vanskor for empire but im still going to base this on the last matchup of navi.us vs empire, if empire stomp then ill go on empire. (medium bet)

m5 vs Fnatic - man i dont even know the lineup for fnatic and i dont even know the lineup for m5, im just going to take this iwth a grain assault and i will go on m5.

XTMXPC vs TBD - will decide when the team comes over

DreamD vs Navi.us - will also depend on the last matchup but most likely ill abstain this as DreamD do have a chance to win this game

EG vs Notoday - I might actually go for a small value bet on NoToday, NoTday are not a complete trash team and if i do bet on NoToday then ill bet at least 4-9 dollars (small bet)

Sotp vs (UG) - Union Gaming are pretty good and i might go medium on this matchup because SotP are pretty bad imo, they dont have enough expierence yet while UG actually have a chance to go into starladder. (medium bet)

Also note that if you invest in a regular brokerage account, you should consider the consequences of short-term vs long-term gains.

You answered yourself in your own post.


&gt;But I want to do things for other people. I want to help others. Humans are social animals and the only reason we have gotten this far in development (as fucked up as it is) is because we have worked together. We have done great and horrific things by doing things for one another, for everyone and for one self. 

&gt;Why is the idea that someone might enjoy doing something so crazy? For example I really enjoy cooking. And I want others to eat the food I make. I don't charge them for it, I just give it to them. I would enjoy cooking just the same by eating some myself and throwing the rest away. I want others to enjoy it too and I want absolutely nothing in return (no thankfulness and no praise).","1409530182"

* **Preferred tonal balance** - Dunno what this means. I'll be using them for mostly walking around, working at a desk and running on treadmills if they're robust enough. However, I also like to record music - in a small apartment. So ideally they should be fairly decent monitors as well, since I don't like to disturb all the other folks here.
* **Past headphones** - [Basically what it comes down to is this: I want a replacement for the Audio-Technica ES7s.](http://neotechdirect.com/wp-content/flagallery/ath-es7/audio-technica-ath-es7-mirror-head-phones2.jpg) I bought a pair back in 08 or something and haven't used anything different since. They are the best headphones I have ever used and incredibly sexy, but I have a problem now: They are also the most fragile. I get less than a year out of each pair I own (which is two) before either the connection begins to fuck up (due to the incredibly flimsy cables) or the driver dies or whatever. And then I have to pay AT's extortionate bullshit to get them repaired (because they're way, way out of warranty by now). Additionally, there's some kind of weird shit with my left ear because the cup on my current cans rubs up against and destroys it. As someone who wears headphones practically all day every day, this is a bit of a problem.

So there it is: Whatever the closest equivalent to the ES7s are, I want them. Especially if they're built and sound like a brick house.

* **What will I be listening to?**

"AntiPOZi","t5_2yfm0","Hitler revealed the sexualities of some the SA's members as shock factor. He was being pressured for months to destroy the SA. It was feared that Röhm, as leader of the SA, would absorb the regular German Army and use it's positioning to start a true socialist revolution. The final straw for Hitler came when President Von Hindenburg issued an ultimatum to either curb the SA or have Hitler removed from office and have martial law declared. Hitler was also paranoid that Röhm and Göring would eventually overthrow him. The idea that the sole reason for destroying the SA was that a few of it's leaders were gay is revisionist and ignores the political climate of the time.

I've lived in a growing community for years and I'm involved with the cultivation, harvest, and processing of hundreds of pounds of herb every year. Most growers do not care about strain name at all and many of them make up the names based on what's popular that year. Do you really think strain names are kept perfectly intact consistently throughout the entire process collection, processing, seedbank, shipping, planting, harvesting, trimming, storing, and changing hands 5 times (and/or sitting on the shelf at your dispensary) before it finally ends up in your bong?

Don't actually have canopus yet, but I assume the last mechdragon is around the corner.

I also use Bastet/Hades/Shiva/Susano/Echidna as a more well rounded team.

Will my I&amp;I team be able to tackle harder descends? My best blue orb changer is Blue fairy... I was really hoping for Gabriel this time around.

What could my best team be? I've tossed around the idea of a mono-G team as I have a bunch of solid G subs (orb changers + canopus and susano), but I thought it might be hard to combine bastet with a lot of row enhancers and TPAers. I could make 3 rows fairly often with the orb changers I have, but a 7 combo in addition that seems unreliable...

I couldn't prove my own god exists so why should I believe in anyone else's? Prove your god to me and then we can talk. Scientifically. 

It's not that these two are opposing forces. Science is a tool. Religion is also a tool. These tools are not our problem. 

Science is a way mankind can more objectively describe and define the world for ourselves despite our subjective perceptions and arrogantly egocentric limitations. Religion fails the litmus test. It fails every test science has for being more than a fanciful man made illusion. 

Science never tried to take Religion down. Science simply has revealed that Religion never shoulda been standing in the first place. Religion is not propped up by reality. So why is it still there? What's really the problem? Who is really mankind's problem. It's apparently mankind. We are our own problem. We made up these tools and we sometimes use them to the wrong end.

One of my docs just had a similar case (our 5th for the year of a not eating money case). Cat not eating, might have been vomiting.  Limited funds.  Finally convinced client to run a small panel, the cheapest we could come up with.  Fairly non specific, slightly elevated glucose, a stress leukogram.  Gave them the options, Hospitalize, Fluids &amp; Meds at home, meds at home.  They went with the cheapest and said they would get the cat to eat.  3 weeks later we were presented with a completely icteric cat gasping for breath who reaked of death.  Sure there have been cases where after a week the cat bounces back slowly (I've seen one this decade) but honestly, if there isn't an improvement in 24-48 hours and the owners are unable to hospitalize and actually figure it out, you will be most likely euthanizing.  And behind that is the tech who has spent HOURS on the phone trying to convince the owner to do something, anything, but continue to watch a sick cat suffer.

Yes, if OP was a client of my practice I would be sugar coating the crap out of this for the next week and being all sympathetic, but they are not so lets be blunt.  The best treatment is out of the financial question.  OP has an unspecific diagnosis. Cat is on at least Day 3 of not eating and no one knows why.  By the time the cheaper option (a regular vet vs an emergency vet) is open OP will be in the ""Make a decision or watch your cat suffer"" realm.  No more sugar coating from a tech who is tired of watching cats die slowly and horribly cause owners can't make decisions.  Remember humane euthanasia is always an option if the animal is sick and diagnostics and/or treatment is beyond the owner's means.","1409530202"

&gt;The ___Sturmabteilung___ (__SA__) (German pronunciation: [ˈʃtʊɐ̯mʔapˌtaɪlʊŋ] ; Storm Detachment or Assault Division, or Brownshirts) functioned as the original [paramilitary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary) wing of the [Nazi Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Party). It played a key role in [Adolf Hitler's rise to power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolf_Hitler%27s_rise_to_power) in the 1920s and 1930s. Their main assignments were providing protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies, disrupting the meetings of the opposing parties, fighting against the [paramilitary units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramilitary) of the opposing parties (especially the *[Rotfrontkämpferbund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotfrontk%C3%A4mpferbund)*) and intimidating Slavic and Romani citizens, unionists and Jews (e.g. the [Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_boycott_of_Jewish_businesses)).

"HomeworkHelp","t5_2r6f3","Your assumptions are correct. I'm sorry if I confused you; a lot of my thermo questions usually deal with complete cycles. I'm also going to go with a different approach to this so take my help with some skepticism. 

In order to do interpolation you need at least 3 data points; 2 'reference points' and 1 'required' point. In this question, you've only got 2 reference points and no information on the 3rd 'required' point. All you know is that the refrigerant is liquid and the enthalpy value is between 3.011 BTU/lbm and 21.337 BTU/lbm. 

The specific heat capacity (constant volume) for R134a is 
cv = .1796 BTU/lbm.R. 

I'm assuming constant volume because your pressure is the one that is different from the saturated values (this is a terrible assumption). 

Your change in temperature is 
T2 - T1 = 60 R. 

Change in enthalpy can be calculated by: 
(d)h = cv (T2-T1) = 10.776 BTU/lb.m

Adding this to h2 = 3.011 BTU/lb.m yields hf = 13.776 BTU/lb.m. This is within the range specified by the refrigerant's qualities. 

Again, I'm not sure if this is right, but I couldn't do the interpolation with what you've given me. Best of luck!","1409530204"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","Everyone receives this protection. In my ideal government, everyone would pay taxes to support this protection, but military service would not be mandatory to anyone.

What you're saying is that Muslims should pay their 2.5% plus whatever non Muslims pay? It seems unfair.

What country taxes less than 2.5% of income? Also, would paying tithes to another religion (for example, Mormons, who pay ten percent) exempt people from government taxes?

Im not sure which countries offer less than 2.5%, but just because Muslims pay this amount does not mean non Muslims have to pay an unreasonable amount (2.5 or less) so I don't see the issue with the small tax. Also, shia Muslims pay another 20% of unused income as tax (mandatory).
Paying tithes would be okay IMO in a just government as long as you pay it the government. If you don't trust the government you could divide the 10% so for example you pay your 1% tax to the government and the remaining 9% where you feel necessary as per your beliefs.

If the laws are basically the same, why have different laws for Muslims and non-Muslims at all?

Because at the time being in a Muslim state was one of the very few places people truly felt safe. This is one of the reasons Islam was able to spread at such a rapid rate. It was neccessary to outline the rights of non Muslims because they weren't protected in many areas of the world. It had to be clear to a non muslim that he or she would get xyz rights if under islamic rule as opposed to ""everyone has these rights"". One could argue its not necessary nowadays which I would disagree with, but the point is the laws only favour non Muslims so I don't see the issue.","1409530206"

As far as the kinds of phones. I have ZTE Avids, ZTE concord IIs, LG optimus' and a Droid 4 in my farm. All of them work wonderfully and I, personally haven't had any hiccups with any of them.

I bought my ZTE Avids for 11 / piece, Concords for 19 / piece and my LG optimus' for 15 / piece. I bought the majority of my phones from Jrush and I luckily haven't had a single dud in all of my purchases from him.

The most popular PIM is most likely Outlook these days however nearly every platform has a number of both thick client (like Outlook) and cloud based (like Google offerings) solutions.

Could be wrong but I think there is a feature to restore an iPhone simply by logging into iCloud so all your data must be up there.

The Archmage Antonidas deck *used* to work pretty well in ladder play the seasons before last, but I personally haven't had too much luck with him nowadays... Looks like there are decks like [this](http://www.hearthpwn.com/decks/95762-archmage-antonidas-is-op) on Hearthpwn, although you'll notice that most of the current decks with high ratings don't include him.

The best-performing Archmage Antonidas deck I used was something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/k83unZ3.png), except there are probably some better choices for cards in that one (can't remember why I put an Arcane Explosion in there; maybe because of Zoo). It's actually a tempo deck as well. I haven't looked back to an Archmage deck since Naxx, so your post kinda makes me want to figure out if there's a really solid version available with some of the newer Naxx cards...

**EDIT:** By the way, for feedback about specific decks and competitive play, there are couple subreddits you might not know about; /r/HearthDecklists and /r/CompetitiveHS. Just FYI! You'll probably get more responses in those subs instead of the main one here...","1409530212"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;  ISIS may without a doubt be the bad guys, but the Kurds are only fighting with their own interests in mind

The Peshmerga fought and died for the Mosul Dam, Zumar and recently [the Shia-Turkomen city of Amerli](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29003321)

If this was all about Kurdish self interest, it would not have fought these battles, as they do not affect the Kurdistan region or the Kurds as much as they affect the Central government. For example, if Mosul Dam were to have been blown up it would have flooded Mosul and Baghdad, not the main Kurdish areas. Amerli is a city that only has Shia Turkomens, with no Kurdish population and is quite far from Kurdish villages, yet Peshmerga were involved in it's liberation.

It's because Pesmerga recognize that to win this war and eliminate the threat, there needs to be a concise removal of the threat.

Obviously there is self-interest in this matter, that is a natural thing to expect, but it isn't all driven by self-interest.","1409530212"

I actually literally continued to suggest to a profoundly hard of hearing girl (she was around 20, and borderline deaf) that she needed to learn sign in depth because her situation mirrored mine 9 years ago. I knew exactly how frustrating it was to talk to people and how tiring it was to decipher everything they say. I kept telling her how much better her life would be, etc etc. Eventually over the summer she took a sign class and she LOVED it.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt; But that's not going to happen, since Uber hasn't acquired the power to throw people in cages for ignoring its edicts or to force people to use its services, so if Uber does start acting out of line then Lyft or any other entrepreneurial competitor will leap in and do to Uber exactly what Uber is doing to the current market.

Actually Uber DOES have that power. This is the problem with capitalism, it leads to an uneven distribution of lawyers. With more better lawyers Uber can effectively sue it's way into keeping an monopoly. It can either tie lyft up or cost it so much money as to make competing impossible... or Uber could actually win and put lyft out of business. 

Also, if lyft does start edging into Uber's market, what would stop Uber from simply buying them? Nothing, really.

"depechemode","t5_2qww2","Not quite: that soundboard recording is from [1981-06-27 Crocs, Rayleigh](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/1981-06-27_Crocs,_Rayleigh,_Essex,_England,_UK), not 1980. The earliest circulating genuine recording is from [1980-10-30 Bridgehouse, London](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/1980-10-30_Bridgehouse,_London,_England,_UK). It's a lousy audience recording, but still historical.

Note that the concert from the video, [1981-08-02 Jenkinsons, Brighton](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/1981-08-02_Jenkinsons,_Brighton,_England,_UK), was one of few concerts that had the slow, ""metallic"" sounding intro which somewhat resembles [Shout](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/Shout). This recording surfaced only recently and is the only one to have a full recording of this intro. This intro was also played at [1981-07-25 Zuiderpark, The Hague](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/1981-07-25_Zuiderpark,_The_Hague,_The_Netherlands), and an incomplete recording of it exists. It was undoubtedly played at other dates, but without recordings or confirmation from those who attended the gig, it's unknown between which dates this intro was played.

Also of interest is the [Summer 1980 Demo Tape](https://www.depechemode-live.com/wiki/Summer_1980_Demo_Tape) with an unreleased studio track.

Lossless recordings of the above mentioned concerts are available to download if you follow the links, as is the demo tape.","1409530218"

It's difficult to explain what kind of person he is without this becoming a tale of teen woe, but I guess he (I?) should be happy that I moved to Amsterdam because I think that if I should see him again, I would stop at nothing to make him suffer for as long as possible before squeezing the live out of him.","1409530226"

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","Here are my thoughts:

I would be suprised if one of the last two sets in Khans is not return to Zendikar. Here are my thoughts
Ugin's Nexus flavor text is, ""All at once Sarkhan's mind fell silent."" This is an allusion to the voices he heard while traveling into the Eye of Ugin. Not to mention that Ugin's Nexus is a Time Walk variant, which suggests time travel, which is already spoiled.

Bitter Revelation flavor text is, ""Here you lie, Ugin. The corpses of worlds will join you in the tomb."" Corpses of worlds could very easily be an allusion to the annihilator mechanic.

Perilous vaults from M15 flavor text, ""The spirit dragon Ugin arranged the hedrons of Zendikar to direct leylines of energy. To disrupt one is to unleash devastation and chaos.""

This could be nothing, but the block design of Zendikar, Worldwake, Rise of the Eldrazi was one in which there was huge implications of what was going on in the first two sets, but it was not reveled until Rise. The way they are going about talking about this block feels very similar.

Gideon went to Ravnica to find an answer to the Eldrazi which included the ability to exile all other permanents. There is no white board wipe in M15, but there is Perilous vaults, which has flavor connections with Zendikar, and more importantly is a boardwipe that exiles getting past those pesky if goes to graveyard triggers.
tl;dr Return to Zendikar confirmed.","1409530228"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","This was my attitude throughout my first year of uni, and I very painfully came to the conclusion (that I've been facing for years) that I have SA. I completely isolated myself and it really affected my school work. Afterwards it really made me think about my future career and all the references and credentials I needed but didn't yet have. 

So I tried getting out of that funk by spending the summer in the complete opposite direction with my job in retail and volunteering at two different places. All places forced me to immerse myself with new people, and put a smile on my face.  Sure I dealt with stupid people and the smile was forced sometimes but it honestly became easier to smile at people I didn't really know and just talk to others in general. It was completely better for me to be busy building my career than sitting at home on sims 3 just because I didn't have very many close friends. It sounds stupid but I realized that when you smile at people, they smile back and when you're friendly, most people are friendly back. As someone on reddit once said, ""treat everyone like a homie"". 

Throughout all of this, it definitely wasn't easy to deal with. You have to make it better for yourself despite how completely gut wrenching it feels at times. No one else was going to improve my situation for me so I had to step up and fix my own situation. ","1409530228"

"chromeos","t5_2r1wh","&gt; there are plans to allow chromebooks to run android apps

no, there are plans to port a few android apps to chromeos.  not the same thing.

official announcement:  https://plus.google.com/+chrome/posts/2LR7bd3xPe8

""..we’re bringing a hand-picked set of Android apps to Chromebooks later this fall, starting with Evernote, Vine and Flipboard.""

if a game company ports a few games from xbox to playstation, people don't go around claiming the playstation will run xbox games.  somehow, folks have twisted the same scenario on chromeos to mean a lot more than it really does.

"customhearthstone","t5_30mve","You'd be better off replacing charge with just a little more stats; you already have a complex card so you shouldn't add in another mechanic unless it buys you a lot.  Charge also synergizes poorly with the rest of the card, so you're using up some of your complexity budget for something that's rarely going to matter.

9/9 for 7 seems fine to me - getting rid of the 0/3s for real is harsh and would be a huge drawback, but there are a lot of other tricks you could do.  Defender of Argus or Sunfury Protector can make Magtheridon useful without actually doing anything with the 0/3s, and any buff (including these two) turn the 0/3s from a disadvantage to a tool.  Silencing him also works; really anything that works on Ancient Watcher.  You can also just play it on a full board, though that's rarely going to be an option.

* McMullans: A bar in Uptown down the road from Jane Bond, pretty good, affordable food, lots of space, good drink selection.

A sig shows up in your system. You have no way to know anything about it other than it's a wormhole until you land on grid with it. It could go anywhere. Just the act of initiating warp to the hole opens it. You right-click and warp-to that signature and the hole is open, even if you never land on grid. Let's say though that you just closed your static, so you KNOW 100% that the new sig is your c5 static and you don't want to open it. You decide you need a refill on your drink and a sammich, so you step away for 5 minutes. In that time, someone rolls into you and opens it for you, they see that there's nothing going on and they roll their hole away. Or there's a scout in your hole that you didn't know about and he opens it.

You now have a wormhole that you think is shut but is actually open, and you have no way at all of telling this. ","1409530235"
"beauty","t5_2qlac","**Loves:**


- [Round lipsticks](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-round-lipstick/16605&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1) - I only have this in one color, but the formula is nice. Not drying, and decent wear time. 


- [Blushes](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-powder-blush/16203&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1) - I use Taupe as a contour powder.


- [Jumbo Lip Pencil](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-jumbo-lip-pencil/16893&amp;cat=0&amp;page=6) - AMAZING wear time, and very opaque. Sliiiightly drying, but you can put lip balm over top of it once it dries, and it won't smudge.


- [Black Label Lipstick](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-black-label-lipstick/16871&amp;cat=0&amp;page=13) - I do not understand why this stuff is not more hyped up. Great wear time, gorgeous colors, not drying. Citrine is my personal fave (although apparently it's currently not in stock on CC).


- [Color Mascara](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-color-mascara/18473&amp;cat=0&amp;page=14) - This one kind of belongs in both the ""love"" and ""meh"" categories. I LOVE the blue. I feel ""meh"" about the purple.


- [Studio Liquid Eyeliner](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-studio-liquid-eyeliner/17493&amp;cat=0&amp;page=15) - The brush is really fine which is great for small details, and Extreme Blue works really nicely along the lashline to give the blue color mascara an extra bit of oomph!


- [Love in Florence eyeshadow palette](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-love-in-florence-eyeshadow-palette/18329&amp;cat=0&amp;page=19) - I was really impressed by this, since I've heard their eyeshadows are a hit and a miss. It's not a complete LOVE since it's not something I reach for regularly, but it definitely is better than ""meh"".



**Meh:**


- [Slim Lip Pencil](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-slim-lip-pencil/16399&amp;cat=0&amp;page=3) - Honestly, these are actually pretty rad, but I can't really call a product I rarely use a LOVE.


- [Single eye shadows](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-single-eyeshadow/16150&amp;cat=0&amp;page=2) - They're not amazing, but they're not awful. They get the job done.


- [Jumbo eye pencils](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-jumbo-eye-pencil/16196&amp;cat=0&amp;page=3) - I totally jumped on the bandwagon with these and convinced myself that they were ah-mazing, but to be honest, I prefer Maybelline Color Tattoos as eye shadow bases over these. No matter how much I blended the product out, I always saw creasing within a few hours when using the Jumbo pencils under my eyeshadow.


- [Slide On Pencil](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-slide-on-pencil/17756&amp;cat=0&amp;page=4) - I really wanted Azure to work well on my waterline, but it was pretty blah. Bought a Milani pencil in the same color and it worked much better. I'd imagine this pencil would work just fine everywhere else, but since I bought a higher quality dupe I gave this one away.


**Hate:**


- [Glam Lipstick Aqua Luxe](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-glam-lipstick-aqua-luxe/18246&amp;cat=0&amp;page=15) - The sparkles make it SUPER gritty, and the ones I bought were not very opaque.


- [Soft Matte Lip Cream](http://www.cherryculture.com/cosmetics/makeup/nyx/nyx-soft-matte-lip-cream/17620&amp;cat=282&amp;page=1) - I feel like I'm the only person on the planet who hates these, but my god are they ever awful (on me).

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","First off, it is everyone's job to keep the party together. You facilitate random happenstances that help push them closer or farther from each other, but the players need to understand that if they split up, it is on them and not you.

If you feel you want a nice piece of railroad to keep them together, you do have the advantage of new players coming in. Make sure that these new people are traveling together as friends. One of them is friends with both the criminal and artisan brewer from a joint operation that disrupted brewers who were not part of the guild. Those two did not realize they were in on the same job, but that knowledge should help make them more friendly to each other.

For the monk, he and the paladin were both at the burial of a prominent elven cleric who died a couple months back. The two got drunk later that night and had a real deep discussion on philosophy and beliefs. The wizard and the monk met more by chance in a library, searching for the same biography of a powerful dragonborn wizard (possible future plot hook).

Final note: if the monk wants to go Rambo, let him. Just roll a d20 for the following random encounters and prepare a blank character sheet. 1-5 (1d4+1 stirges) 6-12 (1d4+2 goblins) 13-18 (1d4+2 wolves) 19-20 (1 owlbear).

Any medium weight sleeping bag will do this time of year. A lightweight tent or tarp is great. I use a 2 man Eureka. Nothing special but its roomy and sets up quickly.

A few tools and a flashlight are a must. Never used them my self but Ive lent a hand to other riders a few times. 

Plan your riding schedule down to the last mile but have an open mind and be realistic about how far you are willing to travel each day. You may get bragging rights for that 700 mile day but you'll have more fun stopping to take in the scenery or making an unplanned side trip.

AND don't forget Water. You might not need it but having a couple liters back up never hurts.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","As a Curse fan since the beginning, this is the worst possible outcome. Honestly 5th/6th would have been better. I'm personally so sick of seeing this team place 4th in every event ever. Curse has been my favorite team for so long, and to see them consistently fall short has been super painful. 

Sigh, the Curse Curse started back at MLG Raleigh when they colluded with Dignitas about Prize Money and played an ARAM in the first game. Ever since then, Dig and CRS have won nothing, and Curse has been one step away twice since then. It's so painful

The team looked really sharp in games 1 and 2, coming out with a decisive strategy, and then they punted game 3. I knew it was over as soon as they lost that game. There's a certain feeling that you get as a fan of a team for a long time, almost like you can feel the momentum better than other teams. As a Miami Dolphins fan as well, I can tell when a game is over and the Dolphins have no chance. I don't care if it is in the first half, I can tell right away. As soon as they lost in game 3, I knew 100% that Curse was going to lose the series even though I thought they were going to cruise to a 3-0. 

If a player/member of CRS reads this: I really support you guys, you guys have played fantastically and really impressed a lot of people and should be proud of the late season surge. Please don't make any drastic roster changes, Xpecial, Quas, and Cop all looked extremely good towards the end. Voy needs more time I think, and IWD was streaky, but if he can stay on his game, he is fantastic. 

Frustrated as a fan right now, but this is definitely the best this team has been since I have been a fan, and it looks like the team can definitely do better in the future. 

TL;DR: Fuck this Curse Curse. Good season nonetheless, the guys played really well and overperformed. Brb crying","1409530244"

It's not bad as a character driven story, but the environment is where it's plot really shines. The game is pretty dense with some solid shooting mechanics, and even a good stealth mechanic.

Mira, te lo voy a explicar claro: a mí un policia me ha dicho: como te pongas tonto te detengo y digo que me has levantado la mano. Y varios compañeros suyos delante. Tengo más experiencias negativas. Ahora bien: ¿se puede descalificar a todo un colectivo por unos tipos que se encubren unos a otros? ¿Es lógico que la palabra de un policia valga más que la mía? ¿Es un policia una persona lo suficientemente formada para ostentar determinadas atribuciones que no le corresponden? Mira, lo voy a repetir: lo de las cámaras es infame, porque es infame hablar con un ciudadano con una cámara grabando; intimida y amedrenta. ¿Que va a ser lo próximo, ir al notario?

I undertsand that Lulu does work well with Akali as well but it doesn't do much when Akali is picked into Maokai and Braum, that's just dead on arrival, especially seeing as Voy was always the one going in and trying to assassinate a carry in those fights because well that's Akali's job but that wasn't the ideal situation to pick Akali.

"LetsNotMeet","t5_2t3t8","That's definitely strange.

It reminds me of my own family, though. My mom has brain damage from multiple electroshock therapies as a child to ""treat"" epilepsy. She was horribly abused by her parents and grandparents, and later emotionally abused by my dad. She wasn't exactly the most stable person, as you can imagine.

My eldest sister had to deal with the brunt of this. My mom got help in the 90s when they figured out a lot of what was wrong with her (she's my best friend and totally happy and healthy now, happy ending here), but my eldest sister was already an adult by this time.

She resents her childhood, hates my mother, and refused to let my mom be a part of her only grandchild's life. My mom apologized countless times, has been there every time my sister's family was in need, but my sister still treats her like dirt. She brought my niece up telling her these horrible stories about my mom, some of them complete fabrications. Now my niece is an adult and has no idea who my mom actually is, and I just find it tragically sad.

My mom stopped trying to make amends eventually because the only time she ever heard from my sister was when they wanted money out of her. My other sister and I don't really associate with our eldest sister. We all dealt with abuse by moms hand, but we understood that she was sick and forgave her. Eldest just can't let go of the past, and we have no desire to listen to her bad mouth our mom. It broke my mom's heart. She never stalked my niece, though.","1409530253"

Foam rolling is good, but don't roll it too much on the bones or joints (But I think foam rolling on the IT band is okay). It's meant to be used on the muscles, as a part of tight muscle tissue release or deep tissue massage.

She chose the colors, and I actually liked them, so when we got divorced and I kept the house, I didn't paint over anything.

I'm now remarried, and my wife actually likes the colors, too, for the most part. So I guess that's one thing my ex did correctly, was choose colors for inside the house.

"bjj","t5_2qn02","Coming to BJJ from a Judo perspective,  belt hierarchy is way more significant in BJJ. In most established judo clubs nearly everyone is a black belt. It is possible to get black belted in Judo from our most prestigious Dojo, the Kodokan in one year (rigorous training everyday). It is not until reaching black that one can be said to know judo. The practitioner actually starts learning judo after becoming a black belt. Shodan literally means Beginning degree.

Judo has standardized techniques, compiled literally into a [text book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Kodokan_judo_techniques) that roughly correspond to a belt color outside Japan. Chapter one: white to green. Chapter two: Green to Blue. and so on until Shodan ""black belt"". 

The major difference I see is standardization. In Judo, testing, competition points and time in rank determine promotion. In BJJ the process and criteria appear largely arbitrary and subjective. consequently achievement outside competition becomes the source of much speculation and controversy. 

the BJJ belts seem to carry with them a sense of identity. That I don't see in Judo. the difference between a judo white-green-blue is much less than a BJJ white-blue-purple as far as time in grade and skill level is concerned.

on a side note on belts: I think sticking athletic tape to belts is stupid. and wearing a belt until it is worn out and faded is also stupid (judo players are guilty here too).

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I once was left with a disturbed child. He had some kind of issue which hadn't been diagnosed yet, my mum used to be his in class helper, but there was one day at Christmas the main class teacher didn't bother turning up, so I was brought in to do her job and she did the teachers job (I was 16 I think). So I was looking after this little kid and caught so many of the other little monsters randomly hitting and kicking him, trying to get a reaction. When the kid I was looking after finally broke and attacked, I let him get a few good hits in before I took him out of the room. The other kid was crying, saying he attacked him for no reason. I told him that if he hits him again, I'm not going to pull him off next time. I don't think anyone had ever talked to those kids like that. I wasn't a teacher and shouldn't have been there so I could get away with letting the bullied kid get away with attacking out of frustration when provoked. 

From what I could tell, the kid wasn't violent unless the other kids provoked him. I knew it was coming before the kids probably did because kids used to do that crap to me, only difference was when I retaliated in any kind of way I got in trouble. I was not going to let that happen in this little boys case. 

I spent most of the day with that kid, he was a very hard kid to handle. Other teachers kept checking up on me with him, I had some worksheets to go through with him and I somehow kept his butt on his chair working instead of running off to the computer like he normally would have done. It was very obvious he had some severe learning difficulties which I wasn't prepared for, but we did ok in the end. The teachers stopped checking up on me after a while because I could handle the kid, they ended up asking me if I was going to become a teacher because I did such a good job with him. I was the first person to keep him calm for an entire day in a long time. ","1409530265"

Although, interesting you'd say comp memory is stagnating, considering we're soon due for a complete paradigm shift. pcRAM, once they figure out how to get the chips work in places that can drop blow freezing temp, will actually make HDDs obsolete and probably even SSDs and DRAM, cause what can compete with the cheapest gb/dollar, static memory with dram speeds that's able to last for 300 years because the ridiculous amount of read/writes they can handle?

This is actually the Axis failing in World War 2, by the way. Germany expected Russia to collapse when they attacked it. Japan expected the US to not have a stomach for war and surrender. Germany hoped Britain would surrender (they didn't really have a plan for it, but their hand was forced by the French/British DoW in response to the Polish attack), so they gave the Battle of Britain a shot in hopes of surrendering Britain. Also didn't work.

It should be looked at under its own merits.  Keep in mind, Sakurai said that he was disappointed with how dexterously demanding Melee was, and I'm inclined to agree.  Just look at the pain M2K is in with his hands now. A game should not cause that and it's not good design for competitive games to require complicated inputs.  The depth should still be there, but it should be added in ways that do not needlessly complicate the inputs.  Right now, M2K is looking at this from the perspective of someone who is simply too ingrained in melee's culture of high technical skill to actually see any depth.  ","1409530274"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I am going to put this here.  Let me know if there is anything wrong with what I have said.  Keep an open mind and Please respond to me if you disagree.  Don't ban me and take me down.  Listen to those who disagree with you.  This is what I emailed DrScientist786:

I know your feeling.  I was there too.  This issue was what caused me to leave Islam.  I know how you just know that there must be some explanation.  But here's how I see it.  Mohammed was a man of his time.  And during those times, slavery was just the reality.  And when a man owns a female slave, of course he had a right to have sex with her whether it was in Rome, Persia, China, and even in the State Mohammed ruled.  The PROBLEM is we can do better.  YOU KNOW we can do better, and we have done better.  WITHOUT the Islamic Sharia and the Quran and the Ahadith.  Now Muslims will talk about how the slaves should be treated well, and how there are ways to work for their freedom(If the master approves), or how if a Man has sex with a female and she has a child from him that she becomes Umm Walad and can't be sold.  But yes indeed this was a normal part throughout Islamic History.  As you mentioned, Mohammed had slaves, Umar ibn al Khattab had slaves, so did Uthman.  Harun Al-Rashid The Abbasid Caliph was the son of another Abbasid Caliph and his Yemeni Slave Girl.  Where do you think the concept of Ottoman Harems came from?  Ottoman Sultans and people who could afford it at the time, had HUGE buildings where they would buy and house dozens or even hundreds of women for his sexual pleasure.  And there are of course no limits to the number of female slaves.  In the Ottoman Empire, they even build their armies through slavery.  They had a system called the Janissaries where they would take young east european christian boys from their families around when they were 10 years old and convert them to Islam and raise them to be soldiers.  And that was the official Army in the Ottoman Empire for hundreds of Years.  And what ISIS is doing today to the Yazidis(with respect to slavery) was common practice not just in the islamic world, but the WHOLE world just 300 years ago.

Now you may be saying ""Alright I see that Slavery has been a normal part of Islamic History but how do I know this is actually allowed by Allah?  How do I know this isn't just Cultural traditions that have infected the perfect and Just Laws of Allah?""  Well here is the proof.

Please read these following Ahadith.  From the Quran, Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim only.(I am ofcourse assuming that you come from a sunni background.  Sorry if you are not, I don't know Shia Islam too well, but atleast the Quranic verses still apply).  JUST READ the following and analyze it objectively.  Just Try.  Keep in mind that ""what your right hand possesses"" is just a euphemism for slave.  And *Coitus interruptus* means pulling your penis out from a woman's vagina before ejaculating.

1) Quran (Surah 4:3)
&gt;If ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly with the orphans, marry women of your choice, two, or three, or four; but if ye fear that ye shall not be able to deal justly (with them), then only one, or that **which your right hands possess**. That will be more suitable, to prevent you from doing injustice.

2) Quran (4:24)
&gt;Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those (slaves) whom your right hands possess.

3) Sahih Muslim ([8:3432](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/muslim/008-smt.php#008.3432))
&gt;Abu Sa'id al-Khudri reported that at the Battle of Hunain Allah's Messenger sent an army to Autas and encountered the enemy and fought with them. Having overcome them and **taken them captives, the Companions of Allah's Messenger seemed to refrain from having intercourse with captive women because of their husbands being polytheists**. Then Allah, Most High, sent down regarding that:**"" And women already married, except those whom your right hands possess (Quran 4:. 24)""** (i. e. they were lawful for them when their 'Idda period came to an end).

4) Quran (Surah 23:1-6)
&gt;**Successful indeed are the believers**. (1) Those who offer their Salât (prayers) with all solemnity and full submissiveness. (2) And those who turn away from Al-Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk, falsehood, and all that Allâh has forbidden). (3) And those who pay the Zakât. (4) And **those who guard their chastity** (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts). (5) **Except from their wives or (slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame** (6)

5) Quran (Surah 33:50)
&gt;O Prophet (Muhammad SAW)! Verily, **We have made lawful to** you your wives, to whom you have paid their Mahr (bridal money given by the husband to his wife at the time of marriage), and **those (slaves) whom your right hand possesses - whom Allâh has given to you**, and the daughters of your 'Ammat (paternal uncles) and the daughters of your 'Amm (paternal aunts) and the daughters of your Khâlat (maternal uncles) and the daughters of your Khâl (maternal aunts) who migrated (from Makkah) with you, and a believing woman if she offers herself to the Prophet, and the Prophet wishes to marry her; a privilege for you only, not for the (rest of) the believers. Indeed We know what We have enjoined upon them about their wives and those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, - in order that there should be no difficulty on you. And Allâh is Ever Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful. (50)

6) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:459](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.459))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Muhairiz: ""I entered the mosque and saw Abu Khudri and sat beside him and asked him about coitus interruptus. Abu said, ""We went out with Allah's messenger for the Ghazwa (attack upon) Banu Mustaliq and **we received captives from among the Arab captives and we desired women and celibacy became hard on us and we loved to do coitus interruptus**. So when we intended to do coitus interruptus we said ""How can we do coitus interruptus without asking Allah's messenger while he is present among us?"" We asked (him) about it and he said ""It is better for you not to do so, for if any soul (till the Day of Resurrection) is predestined to exist, it will exist.""

7) Sahih Bukhari ([5:59:637](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.637))
&gt;Narrated Buraida: The prophet sent Ali to Khalid to bring the Khumus ([one fifth] of the booty) and I hated Ali, and Ali had taken a bath (after a sexual act with a slave girl from the Khumus). I said to Khalid, ""Don't you see this (i.e. Ali)?"" When we reached the prophet I mentioned that to him. He said, ""O Buraida! Do you hate Ali?"" I said, ""Yes"" He said, ""Do you hate him, for he deserves more than that from the Khumus.""

8)Sahih Bukhari [5:59:512](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/059-sbt.php#005.059.512)
&gt;Narrated Anas: The Prophet offered the Fajr Prayer near Khaibar when it was still dark and then said, ""Allahu-Akbar! Khaibar is destroyed, for whenever we approach a (hostile) nation (to fight), then evil will be the morning for those who have been warned."" Then the inhabitants of Khaibar came out running on the roads. **The Prophet had their warriors killed, their offspring and woman taken as captives.** Safiya was amongst the captives, She first came in the share of Dahya Alkali but later on she belonged to the Prophet . The Prophet made her manumission as her 'Mahr'.

9)Sahih Bukhari([3:46:717](http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/hadith/bukhari/046-sbt.php#003.046.717))
&gt;Narrated Ibn Aun: I wrote a letter to Nafi and Nafi wrote in reply to my letter that the **Prophet had suddenly attacked Bani Mustaliq without warning** while they were heedless and their cattle were being watered at the places of water. **Their fighting men were killed and their women and children were taken as captives**; the Prophet got Juwairiya on that day. Nafi said that Ibn 'Umar had told him the above narration and that Ibn 'Umar was in that army.

Alright now that you have read this, I imagine you are feeling mind Fucked like I did when I read this.  ""HOW? WHY? There must be some Hikmah(Wisdom) from it that my puny brain doesn't seem to understand?  I should not cause Fitna because I am not an Islamic Scholar.  Maybe what we don't understand that Slavery was very deeply entranched system and Allah abolished it gradually(like he did Alcohol)""  To that I say, the position that slavery should be abolished is better that Allah's Laws on slavery""(BLASPHEMY)  But it is.  You have a moral compass.

Look at the following verse of the Quran:
&gt; Oh you who believe!  Today I have made unlawful unto you the taking of peoples into Bondage.  How could it be that a man is a slave to another man, while all men are the slaves of Allah?  And if someone from amongst you asks to be compensated(for freeing their slave), then tell him to await a reward greater than the world and everything in it.  That is your promise of your Lord. The Merciful.  The Just.

And you know why you have never heard of this Ayah?? Because it doesn't exist in the Quran.  YOU KNOW, that an Ayah like this is missing from the Quran.  WHY?  Because the Quran is not the book of God.

I know how it feels.  I went through this already.

Just Remember.  Most People around the world are following the wrong religion.  And you might just be one of them.

I'm going to be brutally honest with you. After looking at the first picture, I would have said that you were rather ugly. However, I'm guessing that it's not exactly a flattering picture since the second one is much better! You definitely look better with your hair down. Very nice! So no, you aren't ugly, but you are below average. The good thing is that you have potential; your body looks solid enough, and with the proper clothes, hair and make-up, you'll look *much* better. I get the feeling that you aren't exactly trying. I recommend a visit to /r/makeupaddiction, if you're interested in making a change. ","1409530279"

He had no empathy at all, was very smart, and was also very charming. He was on lithium at the age of 5 (this school had a kindergarten, that was the class he was in) and had been diagnosed as bipolar the year before. I never saw bipolar symptoms though. One incident that stands out in my mind is where he had accidently injured a child when he threw something.  In this case it truly sounded like an accident. The injured child was crying and bleeding (cut to the head) and at the same time the other child was also screaming these primal, top of the lungs screams. He was lying in the sand just screaming. No tears, no crying. Just screams. He was trying to hide the item he had thrown and had buried it in the sand and then laid on top of it. We could not get him to stop screaming. It wasn't until his mom came 30 mins later that she got him to cease the screaming. He expressed to her that he was not upset the other child for hurt but rather that he had been caught. It was disturbing to say the least. Last I heard the family moved back to Canada a year later. The child would be about 17 now. ","1409530285"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","You forgot to respond to any of my criticisms...

 Who cares if one of your relatives was subjected to some of these atrocious experiments, that does not give you the right to misinform and manipulate millions into believing your worldview.  If you make a documentary that goes out of its way to misinform the masses you are a moron and a shitty person. 

&gt;  ...if you listened to the words that accompanied the images you would have heard what they had in common and how the mechanisms employed to subvert democracy were the same as the ones used to subvert communism. 

None of which still exist today, this is one of the many criticisms that you ignored.  It just eludes to the government using television to control people without giving any examples... If they did give examples, you would see how farfetched and delusional they are. 

&gt; Then they realised, you just need to make people think they have democracy, this is achieved by keeping the middle class happy/drugged/oversexed/weight obsessed/ignorant while demonizing anybody who sees the truth, or is worst affected by the hypocrisy. 

You are falling for the mistake in thinking that the documentary wants you to.  You are categorizing both government and corporations as the ""elite"" or ruling powers.  It is only the profit driven private sector that is responsible for creating a culture of ""obesity, drugs, oversexualization, and ignorance.""  To allege that the government is responsible for deceiving the masses into embracing these things to prevent the people from seeing reality is counter to common sense and evidence.  If people are vain and materialistic it is because of the profit driven private sector(perfectly reasonable) not some incentive to deceive people's belief in democracy(why the hell that would be an incentive unless you are some cartoon villain).

Private corporations seek profits and create marketing that causes people to overeat, be overly sexualized, and to consume their products. It has nothing to do with some vast conspiracy to keep people to vote against their interests. WHERE ARE THE EXAMPLES OF THIS IN MODERN TIMES. THERE ARE NONE. 

The government actively tries to reduce obesity, reduce unwanted pregnancy, and to EDUCATE everyone.  There is no evidence or logic to prove your statements or else you would have provided it, instead of expecting me to just take your word. 

Again, there is no evidence of the type of manipulation depicted coming from the governments end.  This documentary is deceiving because it shows the horrendous experiments that the government did, and tries to associate past atrocities with what they COULD be doing now while giving NO EXAMPLES.    

&gt; This comment ironically accuses the doc of doing what the education system does... 

What are you talking about?  The U.S government provides free education to everyone who lives here even illegals.  They are educated on government(mandatory) and economics for FREE.  

&gt; Demonizing academia? How can you justify the poisoning of 32,000 Americans? 

That logically has nothing to do with one another.  Academia does not do things like this anymore... This documentary would have you believe that this is common place still, by providing the quote of that guy who believes he can control electronics with his eyes, stating that the ethical standards are the same now as in ANCIENT GREECE.  This filmmaker is a moron for leaving that part of the interview in and could not be further from the truth. There are ethical standards at universities all around the world that are top notch. The documentary just outright lies to the viewer in a moronic way... ANCIENT GREECE!!!!!

Also there are mechanisms that force governments to behave a certain way at risk of not existing anymore. The biggest force being the ""military arms race."" If a foreign government can control the minds of your people then it is an actual security risk.  If a foreign government can decimate your population with a biological weapon, your own government must know the effects of certain agents and how to counter them. There was a time when the CIA was studying the occult, just in case there were actual powers that could be gained and used for an advantage in warfare.  The experiments by today's standards were atrocious but in a time where imminent non existence was a real threat because of the actions of a foreign governments, Nazi's and Cold War, they were necessary, which is why we kept many of the Nazi scientists.  It is best not to react to such things like an emotional child, but you should act like a rational and understanding adult. 

Now that we know the minds of people cannot be controlled, all efforts, by all governments have seized and the main focus is going into the information going into the humans minds.  Again this documentary would have you believe that the government was successful in researching how the mind can be manipulated, when that could not be further from the truth. If the minds of people can be manipulated, ie Manchurian candidate, then that is a serious security risk.  We needed to know if that was possible in order to continue existing. 

You have not responded to any of my criticisms and would prefer to live in world where things are black and white.  This documentary maker does not know what he is talking about do not give him any special trust just because he made a documentary, ANYONE CAN MAKE A DOCUMENTARY.

Academia is a sacred institution that produces knowledge of reality that allows us to better human civilization. It is not this thing that this documentary presents. Serious academics on the subjects discussed in this film would laugh at this documentary at the amount of spin and misinformation being propagated there in. 


Again the effects of profit driven marketing on culture and society is not evidence of the government manipulating the masses. Please think critically and don't trust documentary makers just because they are documentary makers and are confirming something you read off this guys blog, of whom is equally as uneducated as the person reading his material.  Shit is complicated and does not fit into easily understood categorizations. 

I would appreciate if you responded to my main criticisms of the film so that we can have a rational discussion of the validity of the conclusions made with in it.  I get the feeling you won't be able to do this for one reason or another....ANCIENT GREECE!!! Come on.

It's a different brand (than the Amazon link) and sells for about $7 each. I use about 30 bins to store children's books for schools.

The downsides:

1. The bins have several convex bubbles on the bottom, and thus could, over a long period of time, bend the books that are in direct contact. I cut thick cardboard inserts to line the bottom. Once in a while Costco changes brands and they sell versions without the bubbles.

2. The walls aren't at a 90-degree angle, slanting out as they go up. This works for me because I have different size books. You're likely not to have a snug fit for books.

3. The version currently sold has sharp edges on the outside. I trim them with scissors. Sometimes when Costco changes brands, the boxes don't have the sharp edges.

4. Not water-tight. As you can see from the photo, the lid is two pieces that fold together.

The upside:

1. Sturdy as hell and they stack well. If you're going to stack lots of bins on top of each other, you want bins that won't crack over time.

2. The price is right. Costco sells nicer bins, more expensive bins with flat bottoms, smooth edges, etc., but they're not geared to sustain significant weight on top.","1409530287"

But here's the thing- if you can't imagine what it's like to live through abuse, it is probably not appropriate for you to share what you've learned with the people who have. They have a totally different perspective that you can only guess at, and I think you can already sense that you're going to be a little out of your depth trying to make a difference to them in conversation. You can still be on their side- just recognize that competing with them for attention in public space is going to be complicated for both of you, and they've already fought hard to be able to talk about their abuse at all.

However, I think there are other people who really do need to hear from you, and they aren't abuse victims- they're abusers, or people at risk of becoming abusive. That's where real, important change can happen, and it's where you actually have the most experience and insight to offer. I know it's going to be more difficult finding opportunities to speak with abusers than the abused, but if you want to share your personal perspective and learning, that is where it can make a difference. There are a lot of misconceptions about abuse, or who abusers are, or how to fix it, and you're in a really interesting position to speak to the side who generally isn't exposed to the concepts you have been.

Pour a little tea in the cup and add boiling water to desired strenght/color. 

Now that I live in the US, I have gotten into oolong, lapsang, etc. but I hate the ""recommended"" brewing instructions. ""Steep for 30 seconds."" The tea I get tastes like water and barely has any color. 
It's safe to say that I don't follow the instructions anymore. Instead I put the tea in my glass teapot (don't have a kettle or samovar) with water and either boil it for 2-3 mins and then let it steep for another few minutes (for black tea) or I boil the water, take it off the stove and add the oolong to it and let it steep for 5 mins.

---

&gt;The __Vought F-8 Crusader__ (originally __F8U__) was a single-engine, supersonic, [carrier-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-based_aircraft) [air superiority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_superiority_fighter) [jet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_aircraft) [aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aircraft)  built by [Vought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought) for the [United States Navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy) and the [Marine Corps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps), replacing the [Vought F7U Cutlass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vought_F7U_Cutlass). After the Navy's disappointing experience with the Cutlass, the Crusader was referred to by some as ""Vought's Last Chance"" after company founder [Chance M. Vought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_M._Vought). The first F-8 [prototype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype) was ready for flight in February 1955, and was the last [American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) fighter with [guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun) as the primary weapon, principally serving in the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War).  The __RF-8__ Crusader was a [photo-reconnaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo-reconnaissance) development and operated longer in U.S. service than any of the fighter versions. RF-8s played a crucial role in the [Cuban Missile Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis), providing essential low-level photographs impossible to acquire by other means.  [U.S. Naval Reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Navy_Reserve) units continued to operate the RF-8 until 1987.

Do you have a barbeque? A bbq and salad is a good dinner on a hot night. You can also make a substantial salad using cold meats or legumes. 


Visit the slow-cooker subreddit too, I never use the cream soups and you can omit stock if you wish, using water instead (and then salting the adult portions after you've removed what baby will eat).

Seafood cooks quickly, if you like that. 


You can also make pizza using flatbread, pasta sauce, and a couple of toppings and cheese. It cooks very quickly. ","1409530297"

At the end of it all you just say, ""Ok, I've got the best stuff.. now what?"" Make a new character. Wheeee round and round we go.

I'm looking forward to games that allow the users to make their own goals and content by providing a higher level of player interaction, and some level of risk/reward. For now the only game that can do that, and has high population, is EVE Online. The problem with EVE is it's all point and click, all spaceships, all the time. There's no place to goto a club with friends, party the night away, or shoot something with a gun. No downtime in the game essentially.. and TBH I need that. I need the viceral control that comes with character based mmos... and so we wait.

I actually kind of hope you're right. If this entire thing can be blamed on one malicious hacker and poor security practices on the user side, then the recourse is a lot simpler. Throw the book at the hacker and start teaching users better security practices. A PSA from these celebs about secure passwords and 2FA could get that ball rolling pretty quickly.

http://www.statesman.com/news/news/breaking-news/texas-national-guard-troops-use-border-food-banks/nhCDC/?__federated=1


&gt;Update 4:38 p.m.: Texas National Guard officials said this afternoon they have no indication that any Guardsmen received assistance from the Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley.


&gt;According to spokeswoman Lt. Col. Joanne MacGregor, a “proactive” family assistance coordinator “contacted the Rio Grande Valley food bank to see what resources were potentially available.”


&gt;The Guard said it had identified 50 service members who, because of their early August start date, weren’t going to be paid until Sept. 5.
None of those 50 troops have notified leaders that they had used the food bank, officials said.

 Sounds like we were in the same boat. Right now I'm making 3x what I started at in only 2 years- no certs, no college degree. I didn't sleep for those 2 years though. I didn't hang out with friends. I learned. I hung out here, I broke and fixed, broke and fixed, broke and fixed. I stayed at the office more than I did at home. Some of the other guys I worked with laughed, called me stupid for doing so. Who stayed late? The hard workers. The Senior engineers + Management always stayed until 9pm or so. That meant when they needed to take a break, I was there to chit chat. I'd ask them what they were working on, then ask if I could watch / help. I took note of what problems we had (office B kept having internet outages but we didn't have alerts set up anywhere to notify us. Boom- found an awesome project. Got my boss' blessing and ran with it. Found alertsite.com and added all the offices, all the internet facing routers. That turned into another project, which turned into another.

""Always seems like I'm behind on one thing or another""
Find out what productivity method works for you. For me, it's lists. I keep a notebook with a list of things I need to do each day. Left side of the page is for things that come up during the day, right side is what I plan on doing that day. I cross it off as I go. If I couldn't get to it today then I write it on the next page. After a couple days I wanted to complete everything on the list just so I didn't have to keep rewriting the same tasks. 

""cut me loose on the clients servers with little to no supervision is awesome""

That's amazing. They have trust in you. Keep working at that. Document everything, make those servers perfect. Are they old? Put together an upgrade path for them.

He was a mad dog that needed, and wanted, to be put down. It was fitting that Clem did it since she had become his voice of reason and, frankly speaking, I had been wanting to do that since season 1.","1409530309"

I am still waiting, however, to hear about German hookers. That's probably the only interesting thing in your whole tirade.

"Xcom","t5_2si6x","Honestly, I don't really want the civvies to move for a couple of reasons:

1 - Tacitcal planning.  When I plan my moves for the turn, I want to be able to know like ""Okay, I have 13 movement.  I can't get to him this turn, but I can next turn.""  I really don't want them scampering away and putting themselves just out of reach by a few tiles.


2 - Overwatch.  I have specially trained soldiers and tools to deal with aliens looking to cap anything that moves.  I really don't want Average Frank having a go of it because he sees some soldiers on the other side of the road.  Hell, maybe my soldiers are even screaming ""Don't move, sir! We're coming to you!"" or something like that.


If they made changes to civilian behavior, I'd like to see them utilize cover.  Hunkering down if they are behind cover and trying to put cover between them and the alien if they can see one (though that again leads to the overwatch issue).  Basically, how LW soldiers panic.


If you really want to get technical, have them stand there until you get vision on them.  Then they start being able to use cover and hunker.  Rationalize it as once your soldiers can see the civilian, they can start issuing orders to it (e.g. get down, get behind something, etc.).  Still not sure if I want civilians actively moving about the map.


Some sort of balance would probably need to be struck.  Civilians shouldn't be able to defend themselves as well as your professionally trained soldiers, but every living being has some sort of built in self-preservation behavior, even if it's to just duck down on the ground.","1409530310"

With that many cheap spells I'd definitely add mana wyrms to that deck to feed them. You're not really going to be pushing hard for damage early so I'd probably replace them with leper gnomes.  

Questing adventurer feels kinda weird, not sure if it's going to work too well, but try it out. imo. it dies to easily if you dont have solid same turn followup and board control already.

Stormwind feels the most out of place, I dont think you're going to have enough minions that are going to be effectively boosted by him at any given time on the board. Replace with Loatheb/Spectral Knight/Sunwalker maybe if you want decent body on board?

Mixed feelings about the owl, silence is good sometimes, but you have enough of other removals to get rid of stuff - poly/fireballs.  

Probably swap the gadgetzan with second drake to get that spellpower and certain draw if you have one and shattered with another harvest golem or try sorcerer apprientices.

With DLC, I have no problem paying a reasonable amount for it if the content is there, including good sized new areas to explore.

If, for example, the 20$ December DLC gives me another couple of months of fun , it'll be hard to complain about that.  

Of course I want the base game to deliver a ton of content up front, but beyond that if Bungie can continue to entertain me, I will continue to support the game.

Simply because you have no easy entry level.
For operations you prepare and learn throughout the whole game, doing heroics and flashpoints. If you are not confident in running ops you run some flashpoints and train your skills there.
Same holds for PvP.
You do low level PvP and will have a fair playing ground if you are new and learning.
In low level PvP noone has the benefit of a fully optimized pvp set and you won't face the most hardcore pvp players.

In GSF however you get instantly thrown into a fight with all others and therefore also with the hardcore players who do nothing else than GSF.
And that is not a good environment if you still have to figure out how to even fly that damn thing correctly.
Sure, if you are really skilled it is not that bad and you can sometimes top the leaderboad, even if you have not many upgrades vs upgraded players.
But the problem is learning gsf, and that's not fun if you always get instantly killed after respawning and have no chance killing an opponent.

It would be like playing an operation without ever having fought a boss before or starting your pvp carreer with ranked pvp.
And that's obviously hard.

What GSF needs in my opinion is some sort of tutorial to learn how to fly with some easy ai and/or a bracket segregation.
Something like one bracket for stock ships only or ships with less than 10000 requisition spent.
This would give new players the ability to learn GSF on an even playing field without facing off vs the elite.
Simply a ranked GSF would not cut it imho, as most elite pilots would probably also queue for normal GSF, as seen with 55PvP.

If there was an easy entry point into GSF many players would try GSF out way more, trying to get better without having to be ashamed for crashing from time to time.
Then they could realize how fun it actually is and could get better and better and at some point join the better players whenever they feel ready.","1409530324"

&gt; CO2 from wood =/= CO2 from coal/gas/oil
Wood is part of the natural carbon cycle. When wood rots, CO2 is released into the atmosphere. When a new tree grows, it uses that CO2 as a building block. Burning the tree just accelerates the decomposition and release of CO2 into the atmosphere. This very principle is why ethanol is a ""green"" energy source. Plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere, then you convert that plant material to an energy dense liquid (ethanol), then you put that CO2 back into the atmosphere when you burn the ethanol.
Coal/gas/oil are not part of the natural carbon cycle. These fuels are stored deep in the earth. Under normal conditions (aka no massive asteroids ripping up the crust of the earth), the CO2 from coal/gas/oil will never see the light of day. When these fuels are burned you introduce new carbon into the atmosphere, carbon that really shouldn't be there.

(He arrived at my new stable on February 1, 2014. He was thrown into pretty light work - 2 hours a week - right away, so I presumed that's why he lost weight pretty quickly. But after he hit target weight, he just kept dropping. And dropping. I soon learned that he was worked up all the time because of all the mares in the area. He was refusing to eat because he had to flirt. We gelded him, and then he gained a bit. This was right after his gelding. I also found out at the end of June that the stable owners were not feeding him enough and never checking to ensure he had water. The trainer I was working with stopped working with him but still charged me for training. I was paying $700 a month for absolutely awful care. I would have been content to leave him there for $700 a month if he had been receiving the proper care, but he wasn't. If I had any pictures from June, I would post them so you could see just how skinny he stayed. So we moved.)

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","&gt; I'm reasonably certain it was mentioned somewhere that it can be the same hand that manipulates components that forms the somatic gestures

This is true, but that's assuming that you're using actual components and not a focus. IE you can grab a glob of bat dung out of your component pouch, make your somatic gesture with it in hand, and then let fly a fireball. AFAIK you cannot do the same with a focus, as the somatic component requires a mostly free off-hand, unless you've got warcaster.

&gt;However, as to the original question, I don't think a quarterstaff or other weapon would work as focus. From a pure rules perspective, a focus has no damage listed, and a weapon isn't a focus. From a roleplay perspective , a focus would have to be made from special holy/arcane/sacred materials that probably aren't proper materials for a weapon.

My ruling on that will always and forever be as follows. A standard quarterstaff *can not* be a focus, but any staff focus *can* be used as a quarterstaff without penalty. It's not clear in RAW, and I feel so strongly about this (being one of those cases where common sense and balance are both better served by allowing it) that I'd strongly reconsider playing with a DM if they wouldn't allow my wizard to smack stuff with his focus staff. 

EDIT: and the PHB/BR supports that ruling,

&gt;In many cases, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such.

and

&gt;An object that *bears no resemblance to a weapon* deals 1d4 damage (the DM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object).

"politics","t5_2cneq","Of course it is simplified-- it has to be. Due to the pure size of today's economies nearly everything in economics is simplified. It's called a model. However, simplifications aside, unless you can provide a valid source that there is an ulterior motive outweighing education in the education budget, then there is no reason to assume that money is not, for the most part, intended for education.

Furthermore, your logic for what shows value is flawed. Say that I value the idea that everyone deserves a home, so I donate $1,000 to a homeless man. He uses it on alcohol. The liquor store profits, the money did not go towards a house, and I *could* have bought him a tent instead. All of this in mind, would you say that I don't value the idea that everyone deserves a home because I didn't have the desired outcome?

Lastly, and most importantly, remember what the debate is about. This is about the claim that politicians are intentionally ""going after education"". **Unless you can bring some merit to this claim (cite a valid source), then you are just wasting my time and I will not be replying any further**.

Our government is paving the way for immigrants to come along and price Australian workers out of the job market altogether, while immigrants siphon wealth out of the country by sending every cent that isn't spent on rice, beans, a monthly $10 Lebara/Lycamobile phone credit, etc, right out of the country back to Somalia and other fundamentally structureless places where it will become corruption fuel and warlord earnings. The key to fixing this paradigm doesn't live in globalisation... it doesn't live in bringing the third world right here to the first.

That and the fact that everybody wants university graduates with 5 years experience but able to work 20 hours a day and be on call 24/7, and to be able to pay them minimum wage.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","I'm not sure about that, if I could buy weed and smoke it at a bar you'd have more people going to the bar, a lot more DDs (I personally feel safer in a car with a high person than a drunk one, even though both is illegal, and the effects don't last as long) because they have something to do other than drink, and bring up the bar food tab. Then you'll have the few that smoke more than drink but buy a round or two anyway. Then you'll have the new craft pairing of wine and beer and shot that ""go good with your high"", despite little evidence to support that statement. All in all I think you would find people would stay longer drinking if they could smoke also. I've left the bar just to go smoke, and so have a lot of people I know. 

Personally I drink and smoke a lot anyway, one doesn't really stop the other for me. 

I don't think alcohol sales would go up or down that significantly in retail sales because weed is so easy to find now anyway, being able to buy it in a store wouldn't change the amount of beer bought. If weed prices went down because of less risky business (not illegal so I don't have a risk of selling it) people might even spend more on beer. 

Of course the other side is that is your argument that for some people one does supplement the other, those people would buy more weed and less beer. But, I honestly don't think that would happen as much as you think.

The EU can't compete with the US so they will also play nice until that bloc breaks up and then no individual western European state will be able to do anything anyway.

Russia is too weak to take advantage, and this will only be worsened by ongoing economic and demographic crises. China, again, is too weak to project any power that far.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","For me photography isn't much about 'composition/expression/background'. I mean it is...but..I'm not much of a technical photographer. In fact, many of the photographers that I like aren't either. Sure, people like photos of nude girls because they like photos of nude girls. But, a photograph doesn't have to be technically good for it to be good. (dare I use Uncle Terry as an example? you'd be hard pressed to find a photographer who likes his work, yet, millions of people like his lighting style.). My photos would be torn apart by many of the landscape/technical photographers out there. That's not really my audience though. http://alafoto.com/revenge/Revenge.html (NSFW) that's Ellen Von Unwerth's Revenge - Half the photos miss focus or have other 'technical' issues and thats cool, no one cares about that, the photos are still good, subjectively/in my opinion. And, not because they are nude, I mean god knows I could find better nudes out there to beat off to....if someone is beating off to my photos, I should point them to some better porn. 

For me it's about taking photos that people (specifically the people in them) like. Nude also crosses that comfort level for the people who are in the photos, the people who are taking them, and more so the people who are viewing them. I like that aspect of it. I like that just the subject matter alone causes polarization of emotions.     
 
That, and nude people are pretty sexy. I like sexy. I'm a pretty sex positive person and feel that my photography helps to promote that.    
  
I guess it would be the same thing to ask ""why landscapes"" or ""why street photography"". Subjectively, there isn't a landscape photo I've ever seen that wasn't really 'dull and boring' .....to *me*. 

Sure, your opinion counts! This photography thing we all do is very subjective and that's a cool thing. I get a lot of 'you're just another dude who likes taking photos of nude girls' - I don't mind. I know what my intentions are and know that they aren't ill. I don't see how that's any different than 'you're just another dude who likes taking photos of landscapes'. I don't mind that stigma, or rather, I don't see it as negative.   
 
 
Of all my photos on my tumblr, you know what's the most popular? the top 3 are (or used to be, last I checked) was a selfie of me, with a beard. And a models (the second model I ever shot) her boyfriend, who has a big beard. 3rd was a non-nude girl in a mermaid tail that I shot.

&gt;The worst thing is that his old team will be going to Worlds without him and might even get 1st place this split.

You are kidding right? The best odds TSM have is probably a 1-3 lost. 

&gt;He and Dyrus were the only NA players who would have been to every World Championship and Curse falling apart like this must have broken his heart.

He probably gets paid well enough to stay at CRS. CRS have a decent shot making it next year with this lineup as well.

I hated that I had to study to get an A and they were able to rely on teamwork and screw up the curve. I eventually made it a habit of reporting them when I saw it.

* If you want the best 24"" gaming monitor out there right now, [this Eizo model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/eizo-monitor-fg2421bk) is easily your best bet. Way better blacks and colors than a TN panel, 1ms response time, 120Hz refresh rate, 24"" 1080p. I'm not even sure of any other monitors that fit that description, but it will set you back almost $600.
* If you want the fast response time and high refresh rate of a gaming monitor for cheaper, try [this Asus model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-monitor-vg248qe). It's a TN panel, so its blacks and colors won't look quite as pronounced, but it will do well for competitive gaming and the like. Right now it costs about $270.
* [This Asus model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/asus-monitor-pa248q) has a more ""normal"" response time (6ms) and refresh rate (60Hz), but it's a gorgeous IPS panel (beautiful blacks and colors) for almost $300.
* A similar model to the Asus is [this Dell model](http://pcpartpicker.com/part/dell-monitor-m2gcr), with an IPS pane, 8ms response time, and 60Hz refresh rate, for closer to $260.","1409530352"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Wikipedia [says](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jezail#Features):

&gt;The function of this curve is debated; it may be purely decorative, or it may have allowed the jezail to be tucked under the arm and cradled tightly against the body, as opposed to being held to the shoulder like a typical musket or rifle. The argument against this method of firing is that the flash pan would be dangerously close to the face and the weapon would be harder to aim. It is more likely that the rifle was only tucked under the arm whilst riding a horse or a camel. The curve may also have saved weight; by shaving away some of the heavy wood used for the stock through employment of the new curved shape, whilst maintaining the same structural integrity of the stock it could still be fired from the shoulder safely whilst also being lighter. The weapon was fired by grasping the stock near the trigger, like a pistol, while the curved portion is tucked under the shooter's forearm, allowing the rifle to be fired with one hand while mounted.","1409530355"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","tl;dr I knew both girls from the internet and had separate casual sexual relationships with both of them.  Then I asked if they wanted to have a threesome and both said yes.

I met Mary (not her real name) about a year ago on OKCupid.  We became very casual sexual partners.  She would come into the city and we'd just spend the entire day fucking.  In a little while, our encounters got further and further apart and we just kinda drifted off.

I met Laura (again not her real name) on Reddit actually.  I put up a dirtyr4r post one week asking if anyone in the Philly area was looking to basically have a random sexual encounter.  She said she wanted to and she drove over and we fucked all night long.  Since then she comes over every few weeks.  Again, very casual.  Strictly sex.  Laura and I had talked about trying all sorts of things together and threesomes was one of them.

Last week out of the blue, Mary sent me a message on facebook saying she wanted to fuck again.  I hadn't talked to her in months.  I brought up the idea of a threesome and she was on board.  The girls exchanged pics and both liked what they saw.  

So now I find myself having to wait until Thursday.  The days are going by soooooo slowly.  I feel like a kid as Christmas approaches!  They are meeting at my place on Thursday evening.  I have a feeling I'm going to be pretty distracted at work that day.","1409530355"

If your income is low enough, your minimum monthly payments under IBR/PAYE could still be $0... the government may continue paying the interest on your subsidized loans... you can prevent unpaid interest from capitalizing more than once... and if you happen to be eligible, you can get the clock started on PSLF right away.","1409530357"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I teach at a post-secondary trade school where we've admitted some people that have gone on to do horrible things.  Arguably, the worst offender was a man who I had little contact with throughout his time at the school because he never showed up to class.  He was a first-time father to a child who was less than 2 years old if I recall, and both he and his girlfriend (the mother) were trying to go to school and take care of the baby at the same time.  It didn't work out and eventually he was terminated from the program.

It broke my heart to read the news less than half a year later that he beat his son to death for bedwetting, that the mother was home when he did that heinous act, and did nothing to stop him.  It still hurts my heart when I think about it.

Is this guy the only one that's been through my school and committed a violent crime later?  No.  And maybe I'll share more later, but this guy really struck a chord with me, and I need a break or I'll just be angry and upset for the rest of the night.","1409530358"

Even though clothes like this do not flatter a large frame and tend to make you look fatter, it doesn't matter because it is more important to hide your body if you are really deeply  embarrassed about it. 

(2) **Because he's rich and fuck you.** When you've had as much success as he has you can wear whatever the fuck you want. He's got a loving wife and family.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I'm not a sociologist and I don't work in education. The front that I fight on is making this discussion acceptable. Most people just ignore it because, like I said, it's easier that way. It offends less people. We need to stop caring about 'offense' and start caring about results. To be honest, I have no fucking idea how to even start dealing with that situation. (Education funding wouldn't be a terrible place to start, though - inner city schools may as well be training grounds for hoodrats. A change in drug policy would positively impact the situation as well. There are studies that strongly correlate the presence of both parents in a child's life with a lower probability for a criminal lifestyle, and throwing people in prison for weed or coke is adding fuel to that fire.) At this point, it's so culturally ingrained that it's like fighting a house fire with a squirt gun.  
  
If I had to guess at a cause, I'd say complacency. Just like it's easier to ignore the situation, it's easier to just blend in and be a part of it than it is to rise above it and point out the issues. (Welfare and affirmative action do NOT help the situation.) Those issues, by the way, are undeniable. I think that the solution, if it comes at all, will come from within the black community. You're right in saying that cultures are affected by their combined history and suffering, but we've already taken the first steps to move past that. I think that most of the rest of the burden lies upon them. A charismatic figure could rise to popularity if things got bad enough. However, presently, it's much easier to blame whitey for their problems and unwittingly perpetuate the cycle that holds them down. ","1409530364"

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","QB is really hard to draft in this league, since it's an auction draft. I got Brees for a solid price (slightly below what I had him valued at).

I wasn't about to spend another 30% of my budget on a 2nd QB, so I waited it out, and ended up scraping the bottom of the barrel. I'm just glad I got two starters (I think 10 backup QBs were drafted).

Thankfully this league gives a lot of bonuses for QB rushing, so I'm hopeful that Geno will, at the very least, be serviceable. And who knows, maybe McCown won't be super terrible with VJax and Mike Evans to throw jump balls to. ","1409530365"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","No way. They may win (which I don't think so) but this is a 6-7/10 at best. And I think its for Iroh&amp;Zuko.

Yes Ozai may be stronger than Iroh but not by alot. And I think Zuko makes up for this by being stronger than Azula. ""Determined to take eachother out"" means less morals I guess because that would be the one limiting factor on Iroh (Azula forcing Iroh to fight her while Ozai makes short work of Zuko). But since this is no morals Iroh would use psychology ect. to make Azula rage, make a stupid move and take her out. Zuko wouldn't be cought that fast  and Iroh would join him for the 2v1 on Ozai.

If its the other way round (Ozai fighting Iroh and Zuko fighting Azula) Zuko takes down Azula eventually while Iroh stalls Ozai. It's really a question on how long Iroh can stall and how much he has left in him to 2v1 Ozai afterwards.

If it's just a straight on 2v2 Zuko &amp; Iroh take this 9/10 because they have way better teamwork, are willing to fight with eachother more and have more experience fighting with eachother. The difference in power doesn't make enough of a difference at that point.","1409530368"

First off, perennials establish better and with less watering if you wait until temps start to cool off, so if your area is already moving towards fall weather go ahead and plant. But if you've still got plenty of scorchers in the forecast hold off a while. Now about your soil, I don't see any reason to dig out the old unless you bought so much that just spreading it out will significantly change the topography. You've already tilled the existing soil, so just spreading the new soil and tilling it in should give you a good planting area without significantly changing the composition of the soil so your natives will still feel at home. And whether you plant now or later you'll want to protect against erosion until the plants establish and spread, so something like burlap or landscape fabric would be a good idea. ","1409530371"

We ended up in the foyer with a handful of other displaced persons, and had our own impromptu mini-Sunday school lesson of sorts, where we discussed how we're working through our various callings—at least for me, a really, really helpful exchange of ideas.

Now, I would really like to ask you why you want a laptop? I travel for work and spend a lot of time away from home so that's why I own a gaming laptop (in addition to my desktop battlestation). Do you travel a lot, do you see yourself going to a lot of LAN parties, and/or do you just not have a dedicated desk?

If you're not going to be moving around too much, you may want to consider building yourself an ITX desktop if you're looking for something small/portable. You could definitely build yourself something nice with that budget in an ITX or even micro-ATX form factor. Otherwise, save up your pennies for a little while longer, and get that laptop you really want.

"swtor","t5_2qxih","I believe the problem is the learning curve. Getting into Ops or PvP you have learned the basic controls and gameplay from the leveling experience. When you are ready you can move from the ground game to FPs to HM FPs to SM Ops and so on. Similarly, one can move from normal PvP (kinda-sorta lower level bracket PvP as well, though of course you can't control that) to Ranked. 

However, in GSF, you are just tossed into the deep end after a bare minimum tutorial. There are people whose first memory of GSF is slamming face first into the capital ship. Then you are in a wild fight, getting 2 shot sniped by Gunships, barely being able to control the jumpy mouse, and getting the ""you are not contributing"" message despite trying.

It can be very frustrating and I fully understand why people don't enjoy it and wouldn't want to put in the time to learn it. In the same way some people hate PvP if they try to get into it at 55, or would hate Ops if you had to go straight from the ground game into HMs. I know I gave up the first time I tried it, and only got into it the second time during double requisition (which brought an influx of other newbies, and made me feel I was making meaningful gear progress despite not being very good).

I really like GSF now. I'd like more people to play it. I think you give some good advice. However, I don't think yelling at people to be better and keep playing despite not enjoying themselves is going to improve the health of the game.","1409530384"

During your ICU rotation, use the U/S to try and put in difficult IVs and assist or possibly even place IJ and subclavian central lines (MS4). volunteer to get the machine, set up,  etc and the staff is much more likely to help out and not watch you fall flat on your face (although this will still happen sometime one way or the other. brush it off).

"LetsPlayCritiques","t5_30ftr","Hey, got me to log into this dusty old account I don't use anymore because ever since I've found your channel, I regularly watch your content and have come up with a few points that I feel are relevant to your current concerns. I'll be writing them as they cross my mind, so forgive the disjointed way this'll be formatted.

On point one and four, I think it's an irrelevant point. While so far you've done series wide videos, I think your writing style and aesthetic in general leans to flavors of narration and those don't lend well to short-form works. When I watched your video about the road trip across the west coast I got the distinct impression you were attempting to paint as vivid a portrait that you could, which leads me to believe you're a big fan of reading in general which is no suprise given your obvious love for the role-playing genre. I think do video lengths that you ultimately feel comfortable with, if that means doing a 20 minute video on a standalone title (provided it's a title you have an interest in 'reviewing' at all) then I'd watch it as long as it's something you think deserves to be released.
Also, this is more of a side point, but I think the Mass Effect video and your DA vs Skyrim in particular are some of your best work, and I believe the longest content you've put out thus far.

Point two; I think 'Lets play' is more of an umbrella term that's been used more and more sparingly, but there's no way I'd call anything you make a Let's Play. ""Traditionally"", Let's Plays have been multi-part walkthroughs of the games as they're being played. Your content is more of a dissection and dissemination of (so far) series and the elements and themes that make those games up. I'd be hard-pressed to use a single word to describe it as, but if you want a blanket 'genre', I'd say it falls under 'Documentaries' or something similar- but only because of the long-form method of presentation. Something that sounds better than 'Analysis', I guess.

Point three; I downloaded Audacity three years ago and never looked back. If you dont mind a hardware reccomendation, the Blue Snowball mic is a nice plug-and-use studio mic that runs just under a hundred, got mine on sale at newegg. 

On the final point, without going into staggering detail and probably derailing myself a hundred times with all the shit I could tell you, I'll leave you with this. I'm a huge fan of your work and you're without a doubt my favourite channel on youtube, next to Matthewmatosis, Campster, and MisterBTounge to name a few. I think your style of narration and poetic prose about moments you feel stand out add an element of real humanity and give your perspectives more ground and make them feel much more authentic. I also really enjoy your line delivery, although audio quality is one of the few parts of your videos I feel could use some work. I noticed in the comments someone said you should 'brand' yourself; I disagree completely. I think you've done a fantastic job establishing yourself up to this pont- I think the only thing 'branding' your identity would accomplish is confuse anyone who knows you as I do; Your videos start off with a greeting, and your name. I think that's the most humble and personal way to start any video off, instead of bleating off your 'Cool online persona' and begging for subscribers like every youtube channel today must stoop to. **edit:** I also can't imagine 'Caldwell-Gervais' to be an incredibly common name and I doubt anyone attempting to impersonate you could ever do it justice; I think it adds more character to your channel.

All in all I really enjoy your content and hope to see you put out more in the future, be it more franchise retrospectives or some one-shot analysis.

P.S. I sent a friend your newest Mass Effect video the other day; he fell in love with it and marathoned all your stuff. So there's something to be said about that.","1409530389"

Back when the UFC was getting started fighters from all kinds of disciplines were saying ""yeah, well if you had a *real* Taekwondo/boxing/Wing Chun/whatever fighter they'd have made mincemeat out of the Gracies!"" But that didn't happen because the fighters from those disciplines didn't know how to deal with being put on the ground and choked out or arm barred. The fact that Tyson was the most impressive boxer of his day didn't mean he'd have any better luck. John McCarthy took down Art Jimmerson before the UFC, just to show him how vulnerable he was to getting taken down because he was talking so much shit about how he was going to knock Royce's head off. At that point McCarthy was a cop who had been training with the Gracies for a short time. Boxers clinch all the time, the perfect time to get slammed on their backs and submitted. ","1409530391"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt; If you were to go back in time and meet Christ before His crucifixion, would you reject His divinity because your ""God-given senses"" clearly indicate that He is not God?

I would hear his words and see his miracles. My senses would tell me there was more going on than just man. Also, I doubt that I would think he was God unless the Spirit gave me that revelation as it did Peter. Most people did not accept him as God until the resurrection, including his brother James. So while I'd be wrong, I also count myself in good company! 

I think it's important to note that my senses wouldn't be saying ""not God"" either with the evidence provided which is a clear distinction between the bread that is not body and the wine that is not blood. 

&gt; But he always followed up with an explanation to his Disciples as to what those parables and symbols mean, and they have passed those down to us through the Scriptures. 

Not always. Only when asked or the meaning wasn't obvious. I think the bread and wine were ""obviously"" symbols and by your logic, so did he since he didn't backtrack to explain that they were literal. But it seems we are looking at the same logic and drawing different conclusions and are thus at an impasse there. :)

&gt; Edit 2: While your source *may* be true of Rome, it says nothing of the Eastern Churches, which have ***always*** affirmed that the Eucharist is the literal Body and Blood of Christ.

Not true. The Eastern church didn't adopt this until the 6th century, influenced by the speculation already going on in Rome. The Eastern church adopted it officially much earlier than Rome and ran with it.

"Real_Criticism","t5_33b6m","The quality of these early submissions is high. There is a lot of effort here. I would say the tone of the narration is a bit young adulty for the subject matter. The quality of writing picks up as the story goes along. The beginning has some awkward sentences. 

The prose that is executed well, is a bit too simplistic. 

&gt; It was almost an intolerable experience, but what choice did he have?

THis is you referring to his fear of the pain of dying, as opposed to death as a concept. It's a little bit predictable. When you sit down to describe something that you've never experienced, like dying, you gotta fool me into believing you. As soon as you start to go along the same lines as everyone does when they describe the same thing, you lose the reader. Your description of him avoiding eye contact is better, on the cusp of insightful. These things just take time.

You take risks with the phrasing. Some of it works, some of it doesn't, so just go back over what doesn't work and role the dice again, maybe you'll come up with an interesting way to describe a bare bed frame besides mattressless. Almost handle bar mustache works, though.

What else.

Over all, know what ground you're treading on. Many people have written stuff like this. That means, unless you find something original to say, you're gonna sound like the rest of them. You have some opportunities... you can come up with something original to say about death, you can come up with creepier stories about the cell, you can make the guards less cliche, etc. It kinda works though, I like how Braddock is a stoic and funny sob, and the guards don't give a fuck. 

One positive thing about your writign that leads to a slight negative: you have a point to every paragraph. They're all little self contained anecdotes, and that's good stuff, but it forces you to dwell on things unnecessarily. FOr instance:

&gt;A uniformed guard approached his cell with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder. He looked at Braddock and pointed his index finger at him with his thumb raised, mimicking a gun.
&gt;“Do it, puto.” Braddock grinned at the guard.

THis should end there, there's no reason to say ""but the guard closed his eyes..."" Also, there's much simpler ways to describe things.

A guard stopped in front of Braddock's cell. He made a gun with his thumb and forefinger.
""Do it, puto,"" said Braddock.
...

Don't let your anxiety to describe things exactly overcome your judgement to write sentences that are pleasant to read.

I think it's good that you don't know what the story will be because it will prevent formulaic writing. This was a pleasant read

If you still wonder whether you can handle being a manager, pick apart what duties a manager covers. You probably already do many of them in a smaller scope. As a manager, you'd just do them on a larger scale.

Also, now would be a very good time to document in writing everything you can about his actions, because one of two things will happen with this man: you win the promotion (or not) and he continues to make inappropriate advances toward you, or you blatantly shut him down (whether or not you get the promotion) and he then creates a hostile work environment for you.

At this point, you need to ask yourself whether you'd want to be a manager and most likely have to deal with an even closer working relationship with this man. I'd also start looking for another job, first because it gives you a possible escape route should you need one, and second, because coming to him with a better offer from a competitor may make him realize if he doesn't cut out the bull, he could lose a really great worker.","1409530400"

"forwardsfromgrandma","t5_2t776","Well, if you over generalize a bit, the holy texts are made up of three-ish parts.  1) There's what those in the Jewish faith would call the Torah, (Christians would call this collection of writings the Old Testament, give or take a few books). This is the bit about creation and Moses and whatnot. 2) Christianity adds the New Testament, which is the bit about Jesus and the second coming and whatnot. 3) Muslims add on the Quran which is the bit about Mohammed and whatnot. All part of the same ""true"" story, (Muslims believe that the Quran was revealed to Mohammed by the angel Gabriel, the same entity mentioned in the Christian New Testament and the Jewish Torah). This is why these three religions may refer to each other as ""people of the book"", even though Jewish people don't buy the Jesus stuff, and Christians aren't into the Mohammed thing. It's all really the same narrative. 


Once again, this is over generalized for sure. Christians argue amongst themselves which writings are actually cannon in the Holy Book, so I'm sure any religious person could pick this apart as much as they wanted to. Either way, it's really all a continuation of the same story.","1409530401"

As for the McDonald analogy it falls flat in a couple places so you yourself can ""GTFO"" good sir. Parts and labor has received several sterling reviews from various food critics commenting on their burgers and other fair. Unless now you want to claim that you know more then them too but at that point it's just a bit sad. As well as I've noted elsewhere their food is both high and low brow so also unlike McDonald's the man can do nuance and probably has just a tiny bit more experience with food pairing and cooking in general then you.


The whole reason for this series of replies to you was to hopefully make you realize that you are getting angry over someone else's opinion on what they think is the best.

Please note that this is a quick an dirty analysis of PFR data of QBs between 2011-2013 that have started 8 or more games. 

[Data Set](http://www.pro-football-reference.com/play-index/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;year_min=2011&amp;year_max=2014&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;league_id=&amp;team_id=&amp;is_active=&amp;is_hof=&amp;pos_is_qb=Y&amp;c1stat=av&amp;c1comp=gt&amp;c1val=&amp;c2stat=pass_adj_net_yds_per_att&amp;c2comp=gt&amp;c2val=&amp;c3stat=gs&amp;c3comp=gt&amp;c3val=8&amp;c4stat=&amp;c4comp=gt&amp;c4val=&amp;order_by=pass_adj_net_yds_per_att&amp;draft=0&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2014&amp;type=&amp;draft_round_min=0&amp;draft_round_max=99&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=0&amp;draft_league_id=&amp;draft_team_id=&amp;college_id=all&amp;conference=any&amp;draft_pos_is_qb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_rb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_wr=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_te=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_rec=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_t=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_g=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_c=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_ol=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_dt=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_de=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_dl=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_ilb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_olb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_lb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_cb=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_s=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_db=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_k=Y&amp;draft_pos_is_p=Y)

This is out of 51 QBs who qualified in this metric.

Alex Smith is :


Stat | Ranking
---|---:
ANY/A | #17
AY/A | #13
Comp% | #10
INTs Made | #35* 
Adjusted Value | #17
QB Rating | #12
TDs Thrown| #16

*(Lower Rank = less INTs)

This shows that over the time span (Some of the metrics such as INTs and TD's thrown do not account for the Andrew Lucks, Russell Wilsons and Colin Kaepernicks of the world) Alex has not been an elite QB, but definitely good starter material. 

He's not going to light the world on fire. But to call him a bad QB (relative to his contract) considering that his stats are better than Jay Cutler and Joe Flacco (who have similar if not better contracts) and the big, yawning gap, between him and possible alternatives such as Carson Palmer, Ryan Fitzpatrick et al. would be a disservice to him.

We have to remember that contracts are paid for past performance. They are not, but in the NFL past performance is the closest thing we have to data with predictive power. GMs also understand that and will bid accordingly. 

If we assume Alex plays like a top 16 QB in the NFL next year, we will have at least a handful of teams that do not have the draft pick to draft a rookie starting QB that would bid up Alex's value. 

In my opinion these teams in 2015 would've been vying for Alex's services :

* Rams
* Titans
* Houston
* Cardinals
* Tampa
(I was tempted to add the Bills and Phins but they are very unlikely to step into the ring for QB)

If we have three of the teams picking up a rookie starting QB in 2015 (optimistic prediction since I feel like only Mariota and Hudley are ready for Week 1) then we still have 3 teams bidding for Alex's services (including  the Chiefs since I don't think A.Murray would be ready in 2015). These 3 teams would surely have pushed the contract beyond the current extension in terms of length and guaranteed money. This of course assumes that Alex would be the best FA QB available.

"trailrunning","t5_2s3qi","I'm in the exact same boat as you as far as 'running to the trails'. I use the Salomon XR Shift, which are made for the running situation you describe (with a little more emphasis on the trail portion I suppose.) Like a previous post touched on, the XR shifts aren't ideal for super-rough trails with water features (they aren't water-proof) and scrabbly sections (the lugs are not huge like the Fell Raiser), but they do just fine on compacted trails and dusty or sandy forest roads. 

They fit tight in the mid-section but the toe box is extra-wide. My arch is fairly high and I need the wide toe box, so it's a great fit. The heel is very cushioned and they also have hard plastic ridges on the bottom to keep sharp rocks from stabbing your feet. The shoes you have linked to look very similar, but it looks like they don't have the plastic ridges. I'd actually like to try them sometime since they look very good for the type of trails I like to run.","1409530406"

**Shadowrun: Crossfire** - Honestly I am not too into deck-building games but the character growth in this game looks really awesome. That small addition to the standard deckbuilding adds enough change to make me interested in it. 

I am also trying to get the rest of the expansions to a few others games like **Cosmic Encounter**.

In all markets, the guy who gets to say that about his product, can tack on an automatic ""luxury"" surcharge that goes straight into his pockets. 

Truth be told however, I don't really think Provape is gouging... We saw the post not too long ago with all the redundant quality checks and the post was filled with people complaining about redundancy and inefficiency.  If their product is overpriced, I don't think they're just laughing on their way to the bank, rather they're overkilling it on QC.  

Also, I hear a *lot* of complaints from seasoned users about the ease of use of the Provari and while I concede that it can take some time to navigate the menu, the system does make sense to a novice (especially with change to plain-english error messages rather than codes).  For the target user of this device, who is only going to go into the menu when they first buy it, or when an error occurs, the ""time-it-takes-to-navigate"" is not even a metric I think Provape cares about.  For users like my wife, a single button has far more benefits than an quickly-accessible menu.  So, on *that* note, I *do* think it is a user-friendly device.

I don't foresee Provape reducing their price unless they introduce a ""budget"" line with a different name.  I think they'll ride their status as ""*the* luxury device for regular people"".  If vaping goes mainstream, they'll do fantastic.  If e-cigs remain a niche market for nerds like me, Provape will probably suffer.  Since it would mean a growing community and popular acceptance, I hope their gamble pays off.","1409530414"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","The funny thing is that Joe Rogan called Stefan Molyneux's ideas crazy behind his back when doing Ana's show. This was AFTER Rogan and Stefan agreed about the pretentiousness of doing response videos without the other person in the room.

Ana refuses to talk to Stefan in person because she probably has some sense of self preservation since Stefan's debating skills would eviscerate her. She even acted like she didn't know how to pronounce his last name, which gives credence to the people who criticize her as a pretty face who doesn't put due diligence into researching a subject.

I think Stefan's DMCA issue is terrible and makes him look like a hypocrite. Joe Rogan looks like a spineless wimp for his inconsistency. Ana Kasparian never intended to provide Corolla with criticism or advice. She did it to pander and her attack on Molyneux is the kind of trash you expect from mainstream punditry. The only people who benefitted were people who like drama, people seek the truth that floats over the drama, and the people who do enjoy the best of both.

[**6**] Oh come, let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker! [**7**] For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand. Today, if you hear his voice, [**8**] do not harden your hearts, as at Meribah, as on the day at Massah in the wilderness, [**9**] when your fathers put me to the test and put me to the proof, though they had seen my work. [**10**] For forty years I loathed that generation and said, “They are a people who go astray in their heart, and they have not known my ways.” [**11**] Therefore I swore in my wrath, “They shall not enter my rest.”

1.  Getting him *some* kind of treatment (maybe it'll work, maybe not).

2.  Getting him *out* of society for a while - if he's locked up he can't hurt any of us.

Similarly, you should not sanction (if you're gonna be morally consistent) the invasion of privacy by private citizens.  That means not looking at the pictures and sharing them, even if you endorse punishing those who hacked into celebrities' computers.  I would argue that simply defending that they are a ""whole different set of moral dilemmas"" constitutes the kind of misleading defense of the exact same crime that you'd complain about from a NSA lawyer.  Insofar as your comments cause people to feel morally satisfied that they can both hate the NSA and masturbate to Jennifer Lawrence photos, regardless of intention, you're complicit in an identical moral dilemma as the NSA, simply on a smaller scale.","1409530424"

==
I used to like hanging out at my grandparents estate up in the hills. There was a small grove that you could walk down to from the house and it was covered in trees and things. One side of it was completely impassable to get inside the grove, the other side was easy access to get to. My grandparents had a cat named ""Tom"" (generic name, I know) and he used to follow me down there all the time.

Now, since getting to the passable side of the grove had to take a 20 min hike all the way around to get into that area, I decided to try and go through the impassable side which I thought would be faster...

*SO*, I started heading down with Tom down to the impassable side. It felt like something from Alice in Wonderland, I'm telling you. It got dark as hell in their and just as I realised that I can't get through that area easily to get to my hang out place, I could hear Tom *growling*. I look down at him (he was by my feet) and I notice something that look like a branch on my feet. Now, I forgot to mention I am wearing flip-flops. Just as I start to move my feet, the ""branch"" starts fucking rattling and I realise a rattlesnake is on my feet and hitting its rattle against my bare feet.

I have never ran as fast as I did at that moment and I didn't look back. Though I remember distinctly a loud snap behind me as I ran out of that hell-hole. 

Moral of the story: Don't wear flip-flops when you're treading through thick grass and brush.

**tl;dr:** Tried to take a short cut; rattlesnake on my feet","1409530425"

This is either meaningless or false. Did you beat black people in Ferguson? Bombed kids in Iraq?

&gt; Why should the oligarchy own the means of production and pay those who built the means and work the means every day a pittance. 

Tell me more, and explain me what this has to do with taxes. Taxes are not a way to redistribute income. They're primarily a way to fund public expenditure.

&gt; Each and every one of us built this country thru our work, our taxes and thru our participation in the democratic (pseudo-democratic) process. 

Taxes do not depend on the services we use or need. They depend on how much money poltiicians want. As I already asked, were you ok with the expenditures of every previous government? With Bush's uses of public money ? Clinton's?

The fact that you enjoy some public services doesn't mean the government can decide taxes at will. The prices of the serices we use are known. Taxes should depend on that, and shouldnt change nless services did, as well.

In any case, the state has decided there are legal ways to pay less taxes for the rich. How do you reconcile that?

Now i partially switched over to a Bewitched Alonne Sword and pyromancy. The sword is magic infused too. I didn't respec, just added the extra dex to wield the sword. So the 2 sets it use are Blue flame x2 and Bewitched Alonne sword/pyromancy flame. 

Both are pretty fun. I can still play as a caster witout any real change (just equip a staff if i want some better scaling).

"socialanxiety","t5_2r22n","Right, so on a purely theoretical basis, I dimly remember reading somewhere that most relationships are based on one thing, a common goal. And additionally, relationships based on common goals are the basis of most acquaintances. 

Think about what you would talk about with someone you work with. What's more likely, that you'd talk about the horrible debilitating illness your mom has or uh, work? 

For this reason, small talk usually has to do about the weather or sports because those are topics that affects most people in the community they both share, and so are often talked about not so much to really start a detailed discussion of meteorology or Jordan's career history but to create rapport. 

Once rapport's been established though, endlessly talking about the weather might get you a reputation as tireless bore, so what do you do? Well, people usually bond with strangers over common problems and on working how to overcome it. People who go through wars are often noted as bands of brothers not because they so much in common but because they've both had a shared experience and worked in helping each other out of a freaking existential crises. 

So, this is why volunteering or joining groups or classes is usually a good idea for people looking to form new relationships, because it allows plenty of opportunities to talk about something everyone in the group has experienced, and the more embarrassing or even life-threatening, the stronger the bond.

The only thing is though, once the war or yoga class ends, so will those relationships. You'll have to try to find commonalities deeper than just that to really form a more solid relationship. At this point, find out more about the person, and if you share something with another person, tell that to person your talking to. 

And anyway, you DO have friends and you HAVE been in relationships in the past right? So, somewhere along the line, you actually DID do something to establish a relationship, and all without really thinking I imagine. You can't really force relationships to exist or to be the way you want them to be, but you can work on being friendly basically which will open you up for the possibility of more relationships. 

Agh, sorry about the long post, but I hope it helps. 

TLDR- Good Rapport+Shared Experiences+Something in Common=Relationship

Braking is electric over hydraulic. There is a physical connection between the pedal and the master cylinder, however there is also an electric actuator that provides boost (gas vehicles are typically vacuum assisted which is obviously not possible in an electric car).

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Well, you're partially right.

The most vocal members of the community are absolutely toxic. There is a lot of hate going on and there is a lot of misplaced blame. I try and shut people up about that kind of stuff when it comes up, but that's just how it is, and I can't blame them. By definition, the sub is full of unhappy people, of course they're not going to be helpful and positive.

This doesn't really amount to changing your view, but I'll add that the way you're seeing it as exclusionary isn't totally true. There isn't a problem with non-FA people or former FA people in the sub usually, it's that whenever they take the time to post, it always comes off as patronizing and dismissive of what feels like a very serious problem. Not totally analogous, but how would you feel if you were a slave in the 1800s, and some rich white dude came in and started telling you how you should stop complaining and grow up and that everything is sunshine and rainbows?

Anyway, back on topic. I can counter the idea that it doesn't help anyone by simply saying that it has helped me. When I was going into college, I was a giant ball of anxiety, like a balloon ready to burst. Seeing that I wasn't alone in how I felt or that I wasn't a freak for being so alone relieved just a bit of pressure that let me relax. It also took me down some paths I'm not proud of, and it's definitely imperfect. Hell, it's downright *bad*. I tried to get some positive community interaction going a while ago and a mod shut it down because he, personally, didn't like the the title I'd chosen. But I'll take the bad with the good.

|**name**|[**Parquet Courts**](http://radd.it/music/artist/parquetcourts)|  
|**about artist**|Parquet Courts is a band from New York City.  At the center of the group is A. Savage, who at this point is known for his collaborations with projects like Fergus &amp; Geronimo, Teenage Cool Kids and Wiccans. Savage is joined by three other musicians (“three quarters Texans and three quarters Pisces”) and describes the bands’ debut release as The Fall meets Neil Young. On the band’s debut release, “American Specialties”, this all makes sense. The quartet wanders through the American and British underground, picking away their favorite parts with confidence.

The former is bad not because it treats races differently but because it makes it unfairly difficult for people to get a job, people who are more likely to be poorer and more in need of a job, due to something they have no control over. The latter is good because it reverses the negative consequences of the former, by treating races differently. The apparent hypocrisy caused by calling both of these racism does not exist when you examine what is actually being said.

"gigantic","t5_2rkwg","* They serve the same function to provide customization for your character while making them more powerful or feel different (the system sounds similar to what is in Heroes of the Storm). It is true that it is easier to balance skills over a multitude of items but that was not the point that I made.
* You bring up the point that game is focused on team play ""it's not you against the others, it's your team vs the other team."" I could use that same sentence to describe every other competitive team based game (Dota 2, LoL, etc). You can bring up the point that it is 3rd person game, which centered around objective/point control that requires constant fighting without needing to farm to feel powerful.
* I don't think that artstyle is the correct term to use when trying to say that it is ""easier"" to understand than other competitive games ( it is very pleasing to the eyes). Also easier is really relative term because you would think that a fighting game like Marvel v Capcom would be easy to follow but it can quite difficult since things are happening so fast or you are no familiar with the moves. In Gigantic, there are 10 ppl each with their own abilities, a spectator is going to see a lot of things flying around that is not going to easy to understand unless you play the game (like any other competitive game).

"asktrp","t5_2y2sm","Dude, no offense, but if you're not super aware of compound exercises, you need to do more reading.  You need to own 10 fitness books (at least 6 good ones) and be familiar with their contents.  Workout books often offer information and diagrams about muscle anatomy and body physiology, which is very useful.  In my opinion, they are easy to get into and read.  Having them around and in front of you will motivate you and your lady to workout and learn how to optimize your bodies.

Without expert knowledge, you'll be by definition: ignorant.  No offense though.. just sayin: get good knowledge, don't just watch random ppl in the gym and imitate that-- you won't even know what they're doing, what you're doing or what is effective, nor how to structure your exercise routines.  You also need to understand a bit about how muscles work, how their physiology works, so that you can have optimal workouts and recoveries.

  
Compound exercises should always precede specific muscle group exercises (if these are even involved-- compound alone is great, especially when getting started)


Seriously.. read up.  You should know the proper amount of time to rest in between weight lifting sets, based on the amount of reps


( 2-6 reps: 5 to 2 minutes  (strength)

8-12 reps: 1.5 - 1 min  (hypertrophy)

18-22 reps: 30s - 15s  (toning) )  

(don't go above 20ish reps though, there is really no need.  Personally I never go above 15 reps per set)

You should know that you lift/anaerobic before you aerobic exercise.  Why? They both burn glycogen stores, but glycogen stores (quick use energy) are most useful for quick, intense exercises such as lifting, calisthenics, and sprinting.  Glycogen is not needed for aerobic exercises.  Hence, never do more than 5 mins of aerobics (only as a warmup) before anaerobic exercises.  Personally, I don't even do this-- I just warm up by doing each lifting exercise with 50-75% of the weight I'd use in my normal sets, for one set.

you should also be sure to have protein right after your workout.  a diversity of protein is best.


The great thing about Essential Abs is that it offers a structured routine that steps up intensity, with several exercises.  Go to your local bookstore and check out some books.  You need knowledge (from experts, i.e. fitness authors) or your efforts will be ineffective and unguided.  Seriously.. it always saddens me to see people workout, just based on what they see other people do-- that is dumb as fuck.  One must learn from experts to do the best, and to know the nuances and intricacies involved for optimal results.


I'd also try to find authors that fitness magazines such as Mens Health recommend-- this is how I found the Essential Abs book.


****

Also:

Something you can do to keep exercise easy and interesting: create a routine of just a few exercises, ones that work the whole body.  Say... 5 to start out with.  That is.. calisthenics for about 10 minutes to do the calisthenics.  Then, run for 5 minutes.  Then she'll be done.  15 minutes.  Easy.  

(No Weights; calisthenics; COMPOUND exercise routine example:


lower body:

Squats 45 sec; 30 sec rest; 

Lunges 45 sec; 30 sec rest;


core:  (if you can't do all these reps, then cut them down.. say 10 each, or 12)

ab exercise, 15 reps.  20 sec rest;

2nd ab exercise, 15 reps.  20 sec rest;

lowerback exercise, 15 reps.  20 sec rest;

2nd lowerback exercise, 15 reps.  20 sec rest;


upper body:

pushups, 10 reps

pullups/reverse pushups: 10 reps


(rest between these sets only if needed)

(if needed, add in 2nd pushup variation, or bent over rowing, etc., for compound upperbody exercises)
 
Warm up run -- Slow run for 5 minuts
Alternating sprint, jog, walk -- Sprint for 1 minutes.  Break into a jog for 2 minute.  Walk for 1 (or 2) minutes.  Do this cycle a total of 2 or 3 times.  DONE.

The above routine should take about 20 minutes.  Half strength training (anaerobic), half sprinting.

Later on, add in 15 minutes of real jogging at a constant pace.  Get the idea? Make it interesting...  Make it so you can say ""Ok, we're half done already, that was 10 minutes!!! super easy! only 10 minutes left, all you have to do is expend energy! you don't even have to think, just move your body and exert your muscles!!""

Also Later On, you can also do circuits:  instead of resting between leg exercises (such as squats and lunges above) you can alternative between lower, core, or upper body exercises, giving one region a rest while working a different region.  I.e. squats, pushups, lunges, abs, pullups, lowerback.  done.  now run.

"swtor","t5_2qxih","I'm not a member of the raiding community, but from a PvP perspective, it gets the same complaints and has had the same effects. GSF isn't some special snowflake being singled out here, other than it's newer.

Saying ""well it's just like ranked PvP"" is sort of self-defeating because ranked needs a lot of work, just like GSF does. Leaderboard manipulation. Health of group ranked. Removal of ranked 8v8. Lack of cross server tech.

The complaints about GSF are completely valid, just like the complaints about ranked are. Especially when you consider that GSF doesn't even have the benefit of a ranked queue, so the vets who just want a good match can't even separate into a new queue from those learning the game and gearing up (and of course, individual server populations can't support such a queue. Lack of cross server tech again.).

You know what happens to new people that try grouped ranked? They lose. They lose a lot. The lose badly for the most part. And they stop playing because they keep losing to people better than them and more geared than them. 

Why? 

Because ranked needs a lot of work.

GSF needs a lot of work.

"technology","t5_2qh16","You did pull that out of your ass. The cars can't see and identify objects as far ahead as humans can. Camera systems are limited by how many pixels the imager has. A typical camera right now is 1920x1080 pixels, with a typical lens a human at 200m is approximately 1 pixel large. A computer/camera has no way of telling that it's a person that far away, it needs many pixels to accurately identify a person. Even your 8 bit Nintendo looked nothing near realistic and that would represent 256 pixels.

You run into the same problem with Lidar and radar, the resolution just isn't high enough. And once we eventually increase the resolution of the sensors, we also need to increase the computing power exponentially (2x current vertical pixels * 2x current horizontal pixels = 4x current pixels, 8x current vertical pixels * 8x current horizontal pixels = 64x pixels). Each additional pixel is at least one more computation that needs to be done, and in the better algorithms it could be 4-10 different calculations per pixel.

We will eventually get there (quite likely in the next 50 years), but this is why Google's self driving cars are currently being limited to 20 mph. The cars need to drive that slow in order to safely operate in the dynamic environments.

Military systems are currently leaps and bounds beyond what Google has, but they are also using sensors and computers that cost many times that of Google's.","1409530460"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","In general yeah, but I think you'd have a very hard time getting restaurants on board with it because they'd likely see it as just another potential source of liability.

What if the restaurant only has a limited number of pens on hand each week, they run out, and another customer has a reaction? What if the only employee available to grab a pen is the new kid and the manager forgot to tell him where they're kept or how to use them? (Assuming the manager himself knows the right way, what if he trains people incorrectly?) What if an employee mistakes some other condition with an allergic reaction and the epipen makes it worse? (Wait staff aren't exactly expected to have medical training. Will they in the future? Who pays for that?) What if the customer is morbidly obese and a normal dose of epi doesn't do the trick? Etc, etc, etc.

A long enough time in court might eventually get a lot of restaurants off the hook by showing they acted in good faith to the best of their abilities, but in the meantime if restaurants took on a larger legal responsibility for customer allergies, honest individuals would be more likely to get lazy and scammers with unscrupulous lawyers would have a field day.

One need only observe conservatism with an astute eye. 

One need only observe their armchair militarism, nationalism, fanatical support for law and order at any cost, love of their pea-shooter penis extensions, loyalty to a phony religion, elitism directed at the working poor, anti-elitist populism and anti-intellectualism directed at any liberal who happens to be wealthier and/or better educated than they are, monstrous social Darwinian ideals, idealisation of masculinity, free market fundamentalist rhetoric, traditionalism, and various bigotries (there are too many bigotries to list, really). 

Through such observation, one can only conclude that rightism is a mental illness of sorts. It is the legitimisation and celebration of loutishness and charlatanism. It is the degeneration and destruction of man's humanity through bumbling redneckery and simple-minded, capitalist greed.

 [**Oreo O's**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo%20O's): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Oreo O's__ was a [breakfast cereal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakfast_cereal) made by [Post Foods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Foods) which consisted of [Oreo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oreo_cookie)-flavored O-shaped pieces of cereal.   A variation of Oreo O's called __Extreme Creme Taste Oreo O's__ contained Oreo filling flavored marshmallows. 

&gt;The cereal was launched in 1998  and discontinued in 2007 everywhere outside South Korea.  The cereal is no longer available outside of South Korea because Post and [Kraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods) are no longer [co-branding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-branding). Post owns the recipe to the cereal, while [Mondelez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondelez) owns the rights to the Oreo brand name.

The reason I brought up wow was to prove that it has been done before and can be done again there are many like it eve and everquest for example. Although those target a niche market, so will destiny.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I didn't like that Lincoln used slavery as his justification of a greedy war trying to keep a seceded, independent nation from rising up and challenging his power. I don't like that he issued to many executive orders, let alone what they said. I don't like that he imprisoned journalists and newspaper editors that went against the Union. I don't like that he approved Sherman's March To The Sea to ""teach them a lesson"", or whatever the excuse the generals gave was. And finally, I didn't like that he did little-to-nothing to prevent the war. He simply accepted the secession as something that was happening, and decided to prepare for war against the Confederacy.

As for FDR:

-The Federal Reserve

-Japanese Internment

-**Allowed** Pearl Harbour to happen, that he may justify direct involvement in WWII

-Got us involved in a war that wasn't our own in the first place-both directly and indirectly with lend-lease

-Approved the Marshall Plan to spend massive amounts of money to rebuild a Europe that chose to destroy itself

-Implemented fiscally Socialist policies, and founded many Federal Government Agencies that have done more harm than good to our country- ""The only thing that saved us from the bureaucracy, is its inefficiency.""

So, *that* is why I think FDR and Lincoln are tied for worst.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","What you think I am saying, and what I am actually saying are two very different things in this discussion, and I'm getting a little tired of repeating myself.

&gt;""Movie"" is short for ""Moving Image"". That's the identity of film as a medium. There is nothing said about story whatsoever yet. Film is photography that moves

I gave you the definition of the word movie in my second post, it contains the word story. Stories are therefore integral and inseparable from the definition of what a movie is, this is unarguable and inescapable.

&gt;For you the story is the central part of a given medium, for me it's the *way how the story is told* that is all important

Notice that you are presupposing the notion of a story in order to convey the method in which it is told, you are proving my point. The story must be present first in order for it to be told, this primacy is the key to understanding my argument. Story is primary, the method of telling that story is secondary. I am making no claims as to tell you what you deem important or unimportant, but you yourself presuppose the story, and the definition of a movie presupposes a story. The story itself is more important and presupposes the method of telling said story.

&gt; With your theory one cannot even explain why there are different media. What purpose do they have? If the story or the ""content"" or semantics, or the signified (if you prefer semiotic terminology) are what it's all about, it wouldn't matter what medium is used. A story would be translateable into literature, film, photography, dance, theatre etc. without loosing or gaining anything signficant. A rose would be a rose, would be a rose regardless. I don't really know how you can't see how wrong that is.

First of all, nowhere have I put forward a ""theory"" and I have made no claims as to whether the same story in a different medium gives the viewer/listener/experiencer a different experience. These are both straw men that you have come up with yourself. 

I am finding it hard to be any clearer in my message: **My point is that it is ridiculous for you to dismiss the OP's post because it does not touch on any of the visual aspects of film.**

What you have taken issue with is my reasoning behind this point, which is that story is more important than the method with which it is conveyed and therefore the OP is completely justified in his analysis of the plot and nothing further.

This is not a theory, and I have not made any broad statements about the effect of stories presented in different mediums. In my second post, I even stressed the fact that I am not dismissing cinematography. Cinematography is important to film and I have never said anything contrary to that. The only thing I have said is that story is more important than cinematography. Both are important, one is just more so. Of course the medium through which a story is conveyed matters and has a large effect on the story itself, a book version of Shakespeare will be very different than a play version will be very different than a film version, even if it's the same story. **I have never said anything contrary to this.** All I am saying is that the story is more important than the aspects of medium that are inherent to the medium. They are both important, one is just more so than the other. I don't know how to make this any clearer.

&gt;Saying that the ""Story"" stays the same, so all of these staging of the ""Tempest"" are practically irrelevant to the ""story"", means reducing art or mediality to information theory.

I never said anything that even remotely resembles this.

&gt; Content (story) is not in any way seperable from its form (medium). How the story is conveyed *is* the story.

This is just not true at all. If I regale you with a folksy fishing story in person, it's my fishing story. If I recorded that story, and I transcribe that story word for word onto notebook paper, and you then read that verbatim account of my fishing story, it is still the same story, even though the medium used to convey the story is different. What is different is that when you simply read the story, you don't experience all the inflections I used when telling the story to you in person, you don't get to hear my voice get louder when I describe to you how big the fish I caught was. This does ""affect"" the story, but the story exists independently of how I'm telling it to you. Do you see how this feeds back into my larger point? The story is the main object, the way of telling that story, while important, is secondary.

If I were to have never told anyone my fishing story, it would still be a story. A story need not be communicated to still be a story. I could write a novel that I never publish and it would still be a story, yet it is never conveyed. Taking this thought experiment even further, I could imagine a story in my head, and never tell anyone, and it would still be a story. Yet another way to look at this would be reality. After all, a true story is still a story. Suppose, for a moment, that we launch a probe into outer space and then immediately sever all means of communication and contact with it. We have no idea what is happening to the probe, yet we know that something is happening to it. The probe has a story, yet it is not being conveyed to anyone or in anyway. Therefore, How the story is conveyed cannot *be* the story, because not all stories are conveyed, yet they are still stories.

&gt;Cinematography, Editing etc. is in no way shape or form ornamental to film. It is the very heart, the most integral part of the medium.

Both the assembly of the moving images (cinematography and editing) AND the story are integral to a movie. The word story is in the definition of the word movie, you cannot get more integral than that. Story, however, is more important than cinematography, and Hitchcock and Deakins agree with me on that.","1409530474"

The stuff about how he is ""not being kicked out but choosing to leave"" and the long time gap between admittance and the kicking for instance.

For Gouken, an example would be his close s.mp into c.hp - the close s.mp is +4 on block, but c.hp has 6 frames of startup.  Since there are no normals faster than 3 frames, and most c.lk's are 4 frames, this is designed to catch people crouch teching as they'll tech during that 2 frame gap and you'll score a counter hit.  The s.mp c.hp frame trap is also good for Gouken because it combos on hit and is a hit confirm into normal and EX rush punch.

But to tl;dr frame traps - a gap in normal strings to bait crouch techs and other common defensive options.","1409530479"

Either way, that number continues to feel like a tremendous under-estimation of a worst case scenario.  Time will tell I guess, but I don't understand why the WHO would knowingly underestimate.

"starcitizen","t5_2v94d","I glad that you mentioned the lifestyle selling because I feel that can work wonders in advertisting. It is all the Coca Cola and Apple sell for instance. 

It is why I think the Origin 300i commercial works so well, by philosophising on the concept of speed and the emotion that brings and then embodying it in their product (after-all you don't know much about the 300i itself afterwards) - in that regard it really captures that style of advertising well. 

Then you have RSI Aurora which focused on the modular nature and customising to customers needs. The MISC Freelancer commercial strikes a balance between informing the viewer of the product features, and how that fits a lifestyle.

RSI Constellation tries, but fails I think because (at the risk of repeating myself here) the commercial doesn't feel as though it is about the ship. It is a prop in a scene. It doesn't impress upon the audience a message about why that ship is perfect for the task/lifestyle. You could replace the ship in that commercial and had the same impact. Not looking at the variants as well I think is a lost opportunity. ","1409530481"

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","The main problem is that our culture is so incredibly sex negative. The default message we send is to never do anything sexually you're not 100% comfortable with, setting up a situation where the default is no, rather than yes.

So then we fall into a situation where one person doesn't actively desire sex. They're asked if they want to have sex; the default is no. Our society justifies this - after all, never do anything sexually you don't want to do. Including having sex. And then it falls on the shoulders of the HL to try and coax the LL into wanting to have sex.

Ideally you would want your partner - at a very basic level - to be able to say ""Well, I don't desire sex, but it will make my partner happy, and it's an important part of relationship maintenance, so let's do it."" But walk into TwoX and suggest that the women there should be receptive to relationship maintenance sex and see how fast you get your head chewed off. ""It's my body and I have the right to say no!""

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","Entry #1

It is my 1000th birthday. Heh, I wonder how I managed to keep count of all these years. I thought that alone would drive me insane. But am I sane. Sane, in a manner that after aeons of meditative thinking, I realized the immortality I wished for wasn't a blessing, but a curse. Nearly thousand years has passed since I made that stupid wish. And look at me now. If I still had someone I would bother to love, he or she would have made a big birthday cake for me. Big enough to hold 1000 candle lights. I bet that would have been impressive looking. 

Entry #2

The time has come to abolish this wretched curse. I have no intent of staying alive after seeing countless number of my loved ones wither away before my eyes. Life has nothing new to offer to me, except for one thing which hopefully will be my final demise. 

Entry #3

Preparations are finished. I am about to highjack the next transportation space flight to Mars. If someone other than me is reading this, my name Adam Evanie, although I doubt that matters because by the time you are reading this, I am either long lost or, hopefully, perished and granted the peace of death. 

Entry #4

Final journal before I execute my plan. I am standing next to a launch platform. The guards should be no challenge. Getting into ship shouldn't be a problem either. I know the layout and controls of the shuttle better than depths of my own pockets. After all, I have planned this for years, starting from the day I heard Mars transportation shuttle will be returning to earth. Years of hermit life has dampened my emotions. I will not regret hurting those who will come to my way. 

Entry #5

I made my way into the ship and set off to the skies and towards the stars. Soon enough, I detected some unexpected company in the ship. The people I encountered have a blessing of temporal life, and as such, should have the right to enjoy it. So, I locked myself into the cockpit, unlocked the emergency escape pods and vented the ship by letting all the oxygen escape. Soon enough, scanners indicated lifeforms escaping into pods, which I then jettisoned back to earth. I won't be needing those pods. 

Entry #6

Gosh, breathing absolutely nothing is as painful as I remembered. Luckily, the ship's bays quickly started to ventilate precious O2 back to them from reserve tanks. I checked the stasis chamber; my suspicions were correct: my curse inhibits me from entering blissful state of cryogenic stasis. This will be a very long journey since scientists were not smart enough to develop FTL travel even in 1000 years

Entry #7

I inputted the coordinates to the nearest blackhole. The mightiest forces of the universe must be enough to bypass my course and allow me to meet my maker... As dead. I can't believe I didn't thought of this before

Entry #8

A chilling thought just creeper into my mind. What if it doesn't work. What of I'm not disintegrated into atoms and subjugated to the infinite mass of the black hole once I get close enough. I know God has already punished me a lot, but now I am starting to suspect if God has completely forsaken me

Entry #9

So bored... The only thing keeping me somewhat sane is the sweet thought about the peace a death would bring.

Entry #10

The suspicion... It's too much to bare. I think I am starting to see things I should not. Either this is due to cosmic radiation leaks or the God really wishes to put me on a very difficult ordeal

Entry #11

No hunger. No thirst. I kinda miss the taste of a real food. Wish the food I saw weren't just my own hallucinations. This is definitely an ordeal. 

Entry #12

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!!!1!!11!1!!!

Entry #4613767

The time has finally come. This moment has given me strength to eradicate the madness ravaging my mind. The time has finally come to step out of the door into my demise

***
Unregistered thoughts:

And here I am, stuck on the surface of the black hole. My curse has defied it. The mightiest force in the known universe. Perhaps only the God could be more powerful, but I am afraid the God has forsaken me. I got more than I bargained for and the God is punishing me for it

I can feel the very connections of the atoms and molecules of my body to stretch, but not yielding. I am not sure if my body is against me or is the God forcefully holding them together. 

I can not turn around, but the black holes are pure black. I saw it before one sucked me in. Nothing escapes it, not even my curse if immortality. The pure blackness and complete silence (apart from my own inner voice in my head) reminds me of the complete void: an abyss of emptiness and non-existence. If the heaven did not exist, that is where I would have ended up to, except, I wouldn't have acknowledged it. I could have blissfully ignored it. But I am truly cursed, stuck in here, until the end of very time

[Many millenias later] 

""Houston, you are not going to believe this, but there is a man stuck on the surface of the black hole. Please, perform a life form scan"" an astronaut said in a very exotic looking space suit

""The results are positive. I can see two life forms. You... And someone else"" replied a voice from brain integrated communication device

""I am awaiting further instructions"" replied the astronaut

""Approach the life form"" commands the voice in Astronaut's head

Another thing a teacher did was give a group a score and then multiply it by the number of students in that group. It's up to the group to allocate the points. This one doesn't really punish the slackers so much as it rewards the hard worker. So if a group of 5 got 100 points (resulting in 500 points total) but one guy basically did all the work, the rest could give up like 10 points each so the hard worker gets 140 points while everyone else gets 90.

""O Captain, my Captain.' Who knows where that comes from? Anybody? Not a clue? It's from a poem by Walt Whitman about Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Now in this class, you can either call me Mr. Keating, or if you're slightly more daring, O Captain, my Captain. Now let me dispel a few rumors so they don't fester into facts. Yes, I too attended Hell-ton and survived. And no, at that time I was not the mental giant you see before you. I was the intellectual equivalent of a ninety-eight pound weakling. I would go to the beach and people would kick copies of Byron in my face....

'Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.' The Latin term for that sentiment is Carpe Diem. Now who knows what that means?...Seize the day. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. Why does the writer use these lines?...Because we are food for worms, lads. Because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day gonna stop breathing, turn cold, and die.

Now I would like you to step forward over here and peruse some of the faces from the past. You've walked past them many times. I don't think you've really looked at them. They're not that different from you, are they? Same haircuts. Full of hormones, just like you. Invincible, just like you feel. The world is their oyster. They believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. Their eyes are full of hope, just like you. Did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? Because you see gentlemen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. But if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. Go on, lean in. Listen. Do you hear it? (whispering in a gruff voice) Carpe. Hear it? (whispering) Carpe. Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary.

Saying ""This child has Oppositional-Defiant Disorder and would benefit from the following plan of treatment:..."" is *much* more likely to grant the affected child access to the resources he needs to figure out what the problem is, *before* he kills anybody.","1409530502"

Deja rubla e slabita si înflatia urca spre 8%. A doua masura logica e înarmarea Ukrainei de catre vest. Pe urma incep lucrurile intersante..  Rusia e atat de mare incat poti sa ii zgandari din orice colt al planetei. Spre exemplu americani ar putea sa le conteste claim-urile la platoul arctic. Japonezii au o peninsula de impartit cu rusii.  Majoritatea oamenilor din Siberia au trasaturi asiatice,  China ar putea invoca drepturi asupra unor teritorii.  Unele conducte de gaz de rusiei ar putea fi sabotate. Rubla ar putea suferi atacuri speculative.  Un virus de genul Stuxnet ar putea provoca un incident la o centrala nucleara rusa. Polonia sau România ar putea fi primite sub umbrela nucleara... Șamd. 
În prezent liderii europeni evita sa spargă vesela de porțelan (economia)  dar daca se va sparge vei vedea cat de agresiv poate fi și NATO.

Zealot's Oath does cause percent-based regen to apply as a percent of your ES total instead of your life total, so you can use it as a full ES-based build. You don't need a large life pool.

If you want to speak to him about being grateful and thankful, it might be a good idea to review or teach about food production around the world and how people get the food they see on their plates. There is a lot of labor involved -- these people do backbreaking work certain seasons here and in countries very far away to get X to stores. If your son could also see that others don't have it as nice as he does, he will learn a very important lesson. But this has to be reinforced a lot through discussion (no guilt trips, though) and being told what ""lucky"" and ""fortunate"" are. And that's not a guarantee to make him eat, but at least he's aware.

They need to fix whatever it is that's bugging them and rise to power like they did early in the split.
I also think Seraph and dexter need to be more outspoken and not to be as shy and scared to say what they think. Also I think that they should move Monte to Co analyst along side of zikz and to bring a full time coach, cause it's really hurting them that they don't have someone to boost their confidence after a loss and helping them prepare properly for their next game.","1409530511"

I don't agree with that at all. The amount of poke you offer is probably the highest among all the ADCs. Been screwing around with a new spin on the Legolas build that was posted here a few days ago (just stack BFs and Pick Axes before upgrading them into ER, IE, and LW and then go straight into PD) and the amount of damage a charged Q does mid to early late game is stupid. Just need to land a single, fully charged one on the backline ADC/APC and they're at half health. Makes engaging that much more difficult for the opposing team. He reminds me of AP Nid pre rework except your poke goes through targets but doesn't hit quite as hard (especially late game).","1409530513"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","One of my player characters is struggling with my favorite curse right now. The party stole a magic (cursed) weapon, and it's slowing erasing its wielder's identity.

Each day (or whenever it scores a crit), its wielder (named Dan) is robbed of something intangible. Basically, the curse is eating away at its victim's background and character description.

First to go was Dan's name. Both he and the party have completely forgotten his name. They remember everything else about him though, like their time spent together, etc. Plus, all traces of his name (written, etc) have been made unreadable.

If left unattended, the curse will consume his smile, his ability to laugh, his sense of taste, as well as his ability to appreciate beauty. Then, he'll lose his eye color and hair color. His recollections of his childhood, his parents, and loved ones who he hasn't seen in the past week will be sapped from him. He'll be able to discern that they logically must exist, but not in any detail.

This has opened up a world of possibilities for the story in terms of finding a way to remove this curse. It's also deeply roleplay-centric.","1409530513"

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","Depending on the context, that's a completely appropriate reaction for people to have. AskReddit, for example, makes a point of fostering an environment where even if you have criticism you can't be judgmental. It's really hard to get people to open up on threads if they know all they're going to get is shame and hateful comments. None of that means that the people downvoting you thought that what he was saying was fine, it just means that you were not contributing to the kind of conversation they were aiming for. It's downvotes used correctly rather than in disagreement.

Although yes. There do seem to be a lot of people on here who are pedophiles, and it does gross me out.

Edit: I'm not in any way trying to suggest that I approve of any of it. I'm just saying that if the comment answered the question and someone is derailing the conversation then the downvotes are used appropriately - ie because something is not contributing, rather than because you disagree.

Edit 2: I'm starting to feel that I should clarify, since this seems to have caused some drama - when the comment was initially made there was no context given on where this took place. Knowing now that it was on an iCarly pic, I agree that the downvotes were inappropriate. I used AskReddit as an example specifically because I was trying to provide a counterexample, and perhaps start a conversation about different uses of the voting system.

European countries do very rarely something against their interest just because the US wants. EU and US are natural allies and have common interests so their foreign policy is similar and it may appear that EU is just echoing US's policy.

If the EU was echoing US agenda, the sanctions would be much tougher and NATO army could be in Ukraine by now.

"InsightfulQuestions","t5_2smsq","Well, the problem I have with government subsidies is that, in most cases, inefficiencies aren't cured.  They only create other problems.  Loan guarantees were one of the mechanisms that the government used to allow the banks to make home loans that would normally be a bad business decision.  We saw, in 2008, how that turned out.  Loan guarantees to companies like Solyndra were meant to help bolster the green energy market.  We saw how that turned out.  Every year, hundreds of hay bales go to waste because the government gives subsidies to the farmers to plan hay but not sell it.  The same is true of corn.  Every year, thousands of bushels of corn rot because government subsidies are causing a vast oversupply.  This all while other food products are going up in price.  I wonder what the effect would be on the price of fresh produce would be if we took away the artificial subsidies and allowed farmers to plant the crops that are in demand?  Cheaper fresh produce would mean that more of the poor could afford to eat better quality food.  Better diets correlate with better health, and better health means that less of the healthcare costs in this country would fall upon the shoulders of the tax payers.  

This was what I said in my first comment about the government not having the capacity to understand the ramifications that come with artificially meddling with the economy.  ","1409530523"

Trying to make this a proportional thing is silly: it's like saying it's OK to kill more people in war in Syria than between Israel and the Palestinians because it's a lower proportion of the people (it's not, but that's akin to what you're saying). We shouldn't consider an annexation of 1.5 sq miles the same way we consider the annexation of 10,000 sq miles, no matter the ""proportions"".

By the way, Putin is fighting in Eastern Ukraine too, violating the airspace of other countries, and otherwise encroaching on the sovereignty directly of European countries, so of course their reaction will be different. **And** the death toll in Ukraine is at 2,600 with no signs of stopping, while Operation Protective Edge ended with fewer deaths than that. All in all, these are two different conflicts and your false analogy isn't appreciated.

Edit: Also, Ukraine is a sovereign territory with its own already established borders. Palestinian areas are not. The encroachment is still bad, but it's not the same.","1409530524"

If Bungle was making raids that could be done without communication, they would have implemented Matchmaking. I don't think they arbitrarily restricted the content.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","cant recommend that, i have about a dozen hops and what i think your thinking will not result in a good experience. you may find wisteria kiwi or passionflower will give you similar rapid coverage but much more easily managed longterm. hops during their growing period(april to late july) will need twice weekly attention to keep growing horizontally and even so will not do so very well as it will just send nutrients to other bines to grow up again creating a giant tangled ball of vegetation at the top of your arbor. basically, the nice arbor visible [here](http://peacecountrygardens.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/dscn0536-hops-arbor.jpg?w=640&amp;h=480) will become http://microfarmgardens.com/storage/hops%202.jpg?__SQUARESPACE_CACHEVERSION=1360859070248 in just year 3 in... 3 weeks of inattention? so go on an early summer vacation and thats what you have to come home to.

keep in mind also that hops are scratchy, the bines themselves mature(july and later) to have short stiff hairs that cause scratches comparable to a blackberry or light cat scratches(red irritated skin + drops of blood). it is not something you want people to have regular normal contact with.

hops ARE attractive plants but they really need space away from people and weak plants and an understanding of their growth habit. they are nowhere near as invasive as kudzu(you can easily keep a hop contained in an area) but their growth habit and root vigor should not be underestimated(i ripped out 10ft long 1.5"" diameter roots this spring and the plants didnt notice). hops are not the graceful plant you use to get a nice effect on a pillar or something like you would use a clematis or jasmine for. they are(without regular vigor reducing methods like tilling soil around them or frequent pruning) large brushes you use to paint an area of your yard a nice shade of green to highlight or hide things.

they are excellent choices in locations you would want things obscured seasonally. i use 3 on my greenhouse to keep summer temperatures under 100F, it's fantastic for that, by the time they get large enough to start shading im done using the greenhouse for the year. similarly for obscuring a lightly used dog kennel, it gets covered in green for the summer and i dont have to look at it during a period it's rarely used. fence with neighbors is ugly? toss a couple hops there and in a month or two its practically invisible.","1409530525"

All in all I would say let go. It's a tough thing to do but let go of the desire to control her. Let go of the grudges and negative feelings about her not meeting expectations, of her making poor choices. Praise her for overcoming some tough stuff and be proud of her for that. That's some deep, dark stuff and she's come out the other end relatively well adjusted. Be happy that she isn't still using and do your best to keep the inevitable judgments in check.

Try to continue modeling a healthy happy family for her. Be supportive of her endeavors but don't push her beyond what she's ready for. In the end there is no one way to lead ones life and she's choosing how she wants to live hers.

- Go with the weight, the fit will be tighter, and you can always get your gi hemmed (the difficulty here is that you will need to find a place that **knows how to hem gi's properly for strength.** A friend of mine tried to have his hemmed by an average tailor and the hemming regularly came undone) The bigger risk is that the length of sleeves and pants will be too short, which has no solution.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Had a Japanese student once that came to school in Grade 9, he was quite quiet in the admission interview but we just put it down to the language barrier.

He walked into class on the first day of school and waled straight up to a local student and swung a metal water bottle right at the boy's head. It missed but the Japanese student just didn't let up and started flipping tables in class. We thought the local kid, who had behavioural problems himself, started something which triggered the outburst so we sent the psycho student home for a week to allow him to cool down.

He never turned up to school till a fortnight later when he walked into school and went into the same class but was non-responsive. A female teacher tried to speak with him, she approached him in probably the nicest of ways and was greeted with an elbow in the tits and a push to the face before he ran off to hide in the toilet. This was reported to me and I had to approach him in the toilet where he was pacing up and down by the urinals. He refused to respond and grabbed my tie and started screaming, I quickly got him a side-headlock and pushed him out of the toilet where there were other teachers waiting. He calmed down a little and started bawling so again we took pity and had him sent home for a while with the condition that his parents had him evaluated by a professional before he was allowed back to school.
Weirdo doesn't appear for a month or so, returns to school again. This time it was not with the knowledge of the teachers, some bitch in admissions decided to comply with the requests made by the boy's mother, and allowed him back to school. 
This time he walked into class, kicked the smallest boy in class off the chair and then kicked him in the balls and stomach. All of this was unprovoked. 

Kids in that grade filed out of class and came to me for help. I went to class with my teaching assistant and the boy was stomping the floor while pacing up and down again, I was scared myself but had the presence of mind to corner the boy but force him out of the class by having my assistant make way as the boy backed off. As he paced up and down the corridor upstairs, he tried to make a run for it a few times towards the other building but other male teachers came out and helped to close off the exits. We took care not to touch him this time, when I had to push him out the last time there were accusations of assault and abuse by idiots in admissions even though he had assaulted a female teacher, and stalked him right into the administration office. His mother had not yet left the school and we told her right there that he was not welcome back to school ever again.

I have kind of threatened kids I knew at the time by saying ""If I see you anywhere near these birds again, I will tell your parents (I already had but their parents weren't that great) or call the cops for animal cruelty."" They were already ass faces and knew what that meant. I'd say they were all around 7-11 years old.

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","Depends on your play style. If you want a tier 8 premium that has some tough armor, your choices fall between the Jagdtiger 88 and the IS-6.

The JT88 has incredibly tough frontal armor, a gun with good penetration and a jackhammer rate of fire, and excellent accuracy. Statistically it's the best credit earner in the game, though it is glacially slow to turn and the top speed will usually be around 23kmh at best.

The IS6 is faster and has ridiculously sloped and angled armor everywhere, making it a great brawler. You can feast on pubbie tears with it. The gun has not-so-great penetration, though, meaning you'll probably need to fire premium rounds against tier 9 tanks, or even some tier 8s. That, or get right in their faces and aim for weak spots.","1409530531"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","A *Dragon Age* action-RPG. In my mind, you'd have one player character on their own (though gender and appearance would be customizable) as an Arcane Warrior-esque character (so both combat abilities and magic would be available), though your character's development and gear choice is entirely up to the player.

It'd preserve the tactical approach that *Dragon Age* games require: certain battles would be nigh-impossible unless you find a way to even the odds (divide and conquer, use traps to delay reinforcements, knock down or magically block other enemies while you duel one enemy), combat would emphasize chaining together special attacks to overwhelm enemies (for example, enemies with large shields would require you to stagger them with a hefty hit and then use special attacks to knock their shields out of the way before you can inflict any real damage to them—or you can bash them backwards into hazards/magical effects), and levels would be designed to allow different avenues of attack (chokepoints to thwart groups of warriors, areas with many passages to allow sneak attacks or to start your assault from an optimal position).

You'd still have choices to make, with various outcomes based on your choices. It'd be a more linear game, taking more of a ""sequential levels"" approach rather than most areas being accessible whenever you want to go to them.","1409530531"

The United States does have criminals. Your response is proving my point, there are good Romanies and bad Romanies. If all actions you linked to on Askreddit where done by ethnic Slovaks would anybody notice their ethnicity? Of course not. What you're saying is that some Romanies are bad, well duh. What exactly are you saying? You admitted not all Romanies are bad. Is there a difference between Romani and non-Romani criminals?

Edit: Maybe we should work towards a society where people are treated for who they are instead of their ethnic identity? It isn't easy and will take a lot of work but we can do it. Bad Romanies are just as bad as bad non-Romanies and good Romanies are just as good as good non-Romanies. I know I've been largely simplistic and seemingly naive. I do believe Romanies like other people have free agency. But stigma still plays a big role. It is ignorant to say being treated like shit by your neighbors and be discriminated against wouldn't affect your life. You showed an example of a few Romanies trashing up a Romanian town? So? When edgy white European non-Romani Gentile people commit crimes because it is ""cool"" nobody mentions their ethnicity. Trashing a town is bad of course.","1409530535"

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","I became a patient gamer back in the early aughts when I was in college. Well, I suppose I was a patient-ish gamer who was sliding more and more toward patience. I got a PS2 a few years after its release and saw myself amassing a large collection of games based on the fact that older games, especially used, run cheaper. Being a college kid meant I didn't have that much money, so I might as well wait until games are released as Greatest Hits for $20 or just get marked down.

Grad school and marriage made it easier to wait for games. I started realizing that I just didn't have the time. I got a Wii as soon as it was released and tried to keep up, but after it took me a month to beat Twilight Princess I just stopped caring.  Exploring a game later means I'm not part of the current conversation, but it doesn't mean the game is any less fun.

I can't tell you how many games I've purchased since becoming a patient gamer, and I don't even know what I'm waiting for to go down. Probably the latest Gundam Vs. game, but the fact that it needs to be ported means that the price is always going to be steep. The price only goes down when a new one comes out. (I wanted to get the previous version...but why get that when there's a new one with better units and more people playing it online?

&gt;The __Eastern Front__ of [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II) was a [theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_(warfare\)) of conflict between the European [Axis powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_powers) and [co-belligerent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-belligerence) [Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finland) against the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) and other [allies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_II), which encompassed [Northern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe), [Southern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Europe) and [Central and Eastern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_and_Eastern_Europe) from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945. It has been known as the __Great Patriotic War__ ([Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_language): Великая Отечественная Война) in the former Soviet Union and in modern Russia, while in Germany it was called the __Eastern Front__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *die Ostfront*),  the __Eastern Campaign__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *der Ostfeldzug*) or the __Russian Campaign__ ([German](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_language): *der Rußlandfeldzug*).

You should *ALWAYS* use measuring spoons for salt and acidification processes. You can get away with eyeballing it for years, then you kill a cousin or neighbor. Tomatoes can have a base acidity as low as 4 and as high as 5 or more. The USDA wants you to be well below 4.6. These recipes are scientifically tested and designed for food safety. The canning process is more about chemistry, heat transfer, and microbiology than you think.

* You're throwing out Bair too early / too often. The Diddy player punished you a bit for that.

* For a couple edgeguards you were a little far back from the ledge and tried to Fsmash. That isn't really something I'd suggest doing since they can just get a free sweetspot. Use Dsmash, and be closer instead.

* You missed a couple hits with Fsmash due to the startup being barely too slow. Honestly, Dsmash is typically better, since you're pretty much going to get punished if you miss, anyways.

That said, your platform usage and combos were pretty good. Sorry I wasn't able to help much. I'll definitely be watching this again to learn from it myself.

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","Problems with this build: 

AMD processor. Intel processors have much more performance than AMD ones, especially in games like Battlefield 4. Faster cores &gt; More cores. 

Motherboard/RAM combination: No. The mobo will only support up to 1866 mhz RAM, and yet you include an absurd amount of 2133 RAM. 

Amount of RAM: Some would say that 16 GB of RAM for gaming is overkill, but 32 GB just takes the cake. You will never ever need 32 GB of RAM for today's games and games within the decade. 

2 Monitors: 2 monitors for gaming??? No... just no, unless one is for diagnostics. 2 monitors in game is just staring at a black bar and guessing where to shoot.

For only 16 dollars more you get: 

Significantly faster CPU

Significantly better and newer mobo 

Water cooling

Adequate RAM for gaming for about a decade

One of the best SSD's on the market

1TB (if you need any more for gaming you're a game collector, not a player)

A significantly sexier and faster GPU

A gorgeous and functional case (WHOLE SIDE IS A WINDOW)

An adequate PSU (Platinums aren't really worth it. You'll have to use your PC for 10 years to pay off the difference)

Bigger monitor (1 is all you need)

And the peripherals that you requested.


Happy building!","1409530542"

"Fishing","t5_2qlu4","I would suggest going to Walmart. Right now they have a $25 rod and spinning reel combo, and it comes with a little tackle box with (I think) a red and white spoon, some rubber worms and some crappie jigs.

I would suggest not spending a great deal of money on it until you figure out if its something you really want to get into. That $25 combo will be more than good enough for fishing a pond. Once you get a feel for things, you can go from there.

You don't say what part of the country (or even which country) you are in, but I'm going to make some guesses.

Normal pond inhabitants for a pond like that in the midwest (where I'm at) would be blue gill, crappie, bass and catfish.

For any of those, you can use earthworms on a hook, either with a bobber, or on the bottom. Pick up a pack of panfish hooks. 

Learn to tie a knot for fishing. The improved clinch is a good one, as that rod and reel will come pre-strung with monofillament line. http://www.animatedknots.com/improvedclinch/index.php?Categ=fishing&amp;LogoImage=LogoGrog.jpg&amp;Website=www.animatedknots.com

If you want to fish for bigger bluegill or crappie, you can use some jigs. a 1/16th ounce chartreuse leadhead hook and a 2"" white whirlytailed grub is what I have the most luck with. Rig it like this - http://i189.photobucket.com/albums/z250/bshobbs/ShadSpoonsandJigs004.jpg Slide the grub over the hook so it seats on the leadhead. Then cast it out, and reel it back in while you bob your rod up and down. Think about it like your trying to make the jig go in a sine wave a few feet off the bottom.

For bass, everyone in here recommends a whacky rigged stick bait. I started using it a few weeks ago and I've had a good bit of luck with it. Get some YUM brand stick baits. Rig it like this - http://www.archerandangler.com/forums/content/attachments/645d1358992837-senkorig-jpg/ use a weedless hook and a ziptie. Cast it out and let it sink. Wait till all the ripples are gone. With your pole horizontal, slowly raise your pole up until its vertical, then go back to horizontal while reeling in the slack. Slowly count to 5. Do it again. Repeat. The bass will usually hit it when its falling, and you'll feel your line go taunt. Snap the pole vertical to set the hook. Not too hard, you don't want to yank it out of their mouth, but also not too gentle and not set it. 

For catfish, you really can't beat some hotdogs. Buy some circle hooks. Put half of a hot dog on the hook, then a few inches up a 1/16th ounce weight on the line. Let it sit on the bottom. Make sure to leave the bail on your reel open. You'll know the catfish took it when you see line peeling out. Close the bail and set the hook.

If your fishing for food, don't forget a filet knife. And a sharpener. They never come very sharp. And you won't remember to get a filet knife until after you've caught fish.

Oh, and don't forget to get your fishing license! You don't want to get caught without one, or you can get a nice fat fine, and they can take all of your gear. In Ohio its $19 a year and goes towards a lot of good programs.","1409530545"

And I think saying ""welp, what can you expect these days? Oh well!"" is such a cop out. It's her body, she has a right to say who gets to see her naked and who doesn't. That right to your own body doesn't change no matter what year it is, or what generation you're in, or what technology is available.

"RotMG","t5_2s505","Anywhere in the Highlands-Godlands, almost any of the bosses (Lizard God, Flying Brain, White Demon) can drop an egg as a rare soulbound drop.

I'd recommend being at least level 15-17 at minimum to traverse Godlands as the enemies there are stronger than normal. There also comes into play the amount of damage you do at lower levels versus higher levels. 

You have to get a certain amount of damage to get a Soulbound drop, and at lower levels, that's just not feasible without someone else coming in and stealing your kill, or you getting hit. It's possible, but just better to do it at higher levels. Preferrably with a higher tier weapon. 

Also, if you have it, rings of Attack or Dexterity will help you get more damage in faster so you can get Soulbound drops faster. You'll know you got the drop when you get the weird brown-ish yellow bag that is an egg basket. It will drop either a Common or Uncommon egg that you can then hatch in the Pet Yard. 

I'm sure I over-explained it to you, but lately I have found myself almost memorizing the wikis at times.

"Debate","t5_2qja8","My school does it a LOT differently from yours. At my school, we make all the novices start on policy debate. For the first semester, pretty much everyone debates policy. After the first semester, novices start diversifying. If they want to do other events, then they're reliant on using graduated members and/or older members of our debate team for extra coaching. It works really well because people know all the nouveau techniques of debate. However, for events like PF and Congress, people are really at a disadvantage in terms of talking eloquently to sway lay judges. (However, talking eloquently is an acquired skill.) 

In terms of speech, we don't really focus TOO much on speech. Spend a week going over each type offered in tournaments, then people can choose which events they'd like for each tournament. It's good because you can let people experiment and see what they like and don't like. On the down side, we don't do too well on speech events like DI and HI, but extemp is a really strong point for us.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","I think we're assuming two different things. I'm assuming OP is an adult, and you're thinking OP is a child. Which is fine, but it has bearing on how we both look at this. In the meantime lets look at some of your points, you use to disagree. 

&gt; While a person can indeed be an awful husband, but a good father simultaneously - part of being a good father is keeping the family together and not to hurt your children by betraying their mother.

This statement is a contradiction in itself. It says that the cheating isn't the problem, that him getting caught is. Which is totally wrong. 

Also saying a ""good father is keeping the family together"" that's pretty bullshit. There are some factors which a father can't account for, and just because a marriage fails, it doesn't put him into the ""bad father"" category. 

As far as setting examples go, I'm assuming OP is able and can understand that cheating is wrong. That OP grew up knowing cheating is wrong, and that OP is responding this way, we can once again assume OP isn't going to just run out and start cheating or start thinking cheating is ok. So while OP's dad isn't perfect, how he handles this situation will show his character. 

As far as your personal experience with your dad cheating, it is irrelevant to this situation, as shitty as your situation was that isn't the case with OP. And by your admission you didn't have a good relationship prior to it, so your views on what quantifies a good father could be skewed, so your personal experience, has very little to do with OP situation. 

And you mentioned a couple times, setting a good example. People aren't perfect, they fuck up. How they handle screwing up is what determines their character and the example they make. 

And we don't know if their relationship is crap, we do know they've been together for 31 years, and I don't think the entire relationship was crap, just because he hooked up with a hiker while he was on vacation. That one act does not negate three decades of commitment. ","1409530567"

Okay, I'm glad I wasn't totally missing something, as that's what I assumed the fuss was over.

As far as fighters being good archers... they should be able to do that. They're the master of whatever fighting style they choose, and archery is a fighting style. The badass military archer doesn't step on the toes of the woodland ranger, in my mind. They both have pros and cons.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;You can't compare any current arrangement to an unrealistic hypothetical alternative

Well, that *is* what they're doing.

Anyway, the difference between the cliff-hanger &amp; the sweatshop worker is how feasible it would be for the supposed villain in either scenario to make a better proposition.

There is nothing preventing the person who is rescuing the cliff-hanger from simply helping the guy up without demanding anything in return. The act of rescuing him is not costly, yet we're using the opportunity to extract a large amount of resources from him.

In the case of sweatshops, I suppose what we're imagining is an economic reality that makes any better working conditions impossible, given the cost of their being operated, the cost of their labor, or, let's say, the point at which it wouldn't be worth it for them to be operating in that country at all.

*(I've also been told in the past that the sweatshops in developing countries, which we know next to nothing about sans their very existence, are usually set up in a way that libertarians would consider illegitimate, usually using state power to appropriate if not expropriate land or resources, &amp; then passing a variety of legal restrictions meant to ensure that the people of the region have no better options. I'm not depending on this point, since I know so little about it, but I think it's worth considering that the amount of information we have about what's really going on over there is very minimal, &amp; the idea that the sweatshop-owners are all acting in a way consistent with the NAP is probably quite low.)*","1409530568"

1,000,000 rounds / 52,000 RPM =  19 Minutes and 14 seconds of fully automatic fire from each MG3.

Edit: Clearer way to show this-
1,000,000 rounds divided by 40 MG3's leaves 25,000 rounds for each MG3 to fire. 25,000 rounds divided by 1300 RPM gives you 19.23 minutes of automatic fire for each MG3.

Where would TFC be if Defoe wasn't in this squad? In the basement where they normally are. TFC doesn't have ""depth"" the only people who think this also believe any fucking player that comes up from the academy is going to be ""great""! Only because they've heard the name before and know of no one else.

My problem is if they win anything at any point i guarantee it wont feel as satisfying to anyone in N.A. as it would feel if TSM or C9 or CLG etc etc won. It would just feel like a team we paid to put together for the best chances to win or something.

Second is because they see themselves as a sort of ""bizarro reddit"" where they mirror reddit back at itself, so upvotes are downvotes, etc.

Another is because it confuses people and makes them angry when they visit the sub, which amuses them.

My mothers boyfriend proceeded to curse the guy out and threaten him not to go near my mother or he would kill him. Second time he went to threaten him i was in the living room with them playing starcraft with a friend. The hitchhiker proceeded to take little brothers baseball bat and bust his face in, left him with a broken jaw and laying in a pool of blood while he stole my brothers bat then run out backdoor into the woods. 

My friend started crying while my heart didnt skip a beat, he pretty much had the police take him home and he never really talked to me much after that. Thats just what happens when you try to have normal kids as friends. I could go all night with stories like this.","1409530582"

Yes, it's about privacy. But it is also about gender. While male nudes have been leaked (I cannot think of anyone's besides Bard Pitt's mind you) it would be disingenuous to say that reactions have been the same, or that they happen at anything close to the same frequency.

I could foresee them changing that though because attendance was way down. We went a couple hours before kickoff and there was only about 40 people there. I became a member of the alumni association this year, so we hung out in Frazier for a bit. It was cool and had lots of TV screens to watch the games on, so that was enjoyable.

The game: So stinking hot. They shouldn't have games any earlier than 8:00PM on opening weekend. Our section was in full sun until the end of the second quarter. I was trying to estimate exactly where the additions to the stadium would be and if it would block the sun in our section. I was only in the sun for half of that because I lost my phone and was trying to find lost &amp; found in the stadium. When I was gone people scooted over and took over my seats so we had to move down a bench. The lady behind me had a clicker she kept randomly clicking and had her bare feet next to me on the bleacher during half time. I'm seriously considering getting a padded seat, but we stood for most of the night, so I can't decide if it's worth the money.

It seemed pretty tame in the stadium and I really think it was because of the heat. Can't wait for some rowdy night games!","1409530583"

Right now, in developing nations the public cannot afford to take a whole day or two off work for a test match, while it happens very often in England. I suppose with increased average income we'll see better test attendances in India.","1409530584"

As far we know Freddy's never had suits to be worn by a live person so possibly some how Freddy was himself the killer that set off the chain of events with the five children and the bite of 87. The second question is what if the bite of 87 was a legitimate error of machinery or AI that caused the first haunting (Even though we heard the victim lived albeit without the frontal lobes.).

And we had to plan it sort of quickly because I was pregnant. (Lost the baby due to complications with an existing health condition). 

The point is that Seattle is different. And having to call to tell someone you will send them a wedding invite with a years notice is not the way it's done in other places. So even if you're right, Seattle is different in a way that people in other places would find upsetting. ","1409530587"

"freeletics","t5_2xrcb","Definitely agree with your first point. Progressive training is only half of what you need as an athlete; you also need the ability to modify though in order to maximize your plan to meet your specific goals. The program would be infinitely better if it also included a way to customize it so that you could choose specifically which workouts were okay and which were not.

I have to disagree with your second point about running though. Running is the quintessential cardio workout, and this is evident by the fact that it is used in training for nearly every other sport, the original Freeletics workouts included. I think the Freeletics program just needs to offer a way to limit the maximum distance and number of runs in a week, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that they should not be included at all. At the very least, even if they completely got rid of the runs, there's still plenty of running in the Freeletics program between workouts like Atlas, Iris, or Uranos, so running is definitely still part of the program's roots.","1409530588"

&gt;

&gt;__Sadistic personality disorder__ was a [personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality_disorder) diagnosis involving [sadism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadism_and_masochism_(as_medical_terms\)) which appeared only in an appendix of the revised third edition of the [APA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Psychiatric_Association)'s [Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_and_Statistical_Manual_of_Mental_Disorders) ([DSM-III-R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-III-R)).  The later versions of the DSM ([DSM-IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV), [DSM-IV-TR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-IV-TR) and [DSM-5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSM-5)) do not include it, so it is no longer considered a valid diagnostic category. Yet some still study the disorder. 

&gt;Sadism is a behavioral disorder characterized by callous, vicious, [manipulative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_manipulation), and degrading behavior expressed towards other people. To date, the exact cause of sadism is not known. However, many theories have been given to explain the possible reasons underlying the development of a sadistic personality in an individual.

&gt; Burning man has never claimed to be a green event.

&gt;CO2 from wood =/= CO2 from coal/gas/oil
Wood is part of the natural carbon cycle. When wood rots, CO2 is released into the atmosphere. When a new tree grows, it uses that CO2 as a building block. Burning the tree just accelerates the decomposition and release of CO2 into the atmosphere. This very principle is why ethanol is a ""green"" energy source. Plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere, then you convert that plant material to an energy dense liquid (ethanol), then you put that CO2 back into the atmosphere when you burn the ethanol.
Coal/gas/oil are not part of the natural carbon cycle. These fuels are stored deep in the earth. Under normal conditions (aka no massive asteroids ripping up the crust of the earth), the CO2 from coal/gas/oil will never see the light of day. When these fuels are burned you introduce new carbon into the atmosphere, carbon that really shouldn't be there.

Nowhere did I say people should NOT go to the police, I simply hold the position that it isn't enough. I absolutely support a woman name-shaming any man who threatens her.

Without knowing your girlfriend, we can't really explain her logic to you (unless she's just unaware of the facts, but it doesn't sound like that's the case). 

My suggestion is, if you haven't already done so, have a conversation about how you would handle an accidental pregnancy. It's a conversation that every heterosexual couple needs to have, because our birth control methods have come a long way and are pretty damn good, but it's still never going to be 100 percent no matter what you do. Would you have an abortion? If so, who pays for it? Do you put it up for adoption? If so, how does that process work? Research it. Do you keep it and raise it? If so, will you get married? Will you move in together? Will you live separately? Etc.

Work out the details and make sure you're both on the same page. It might put her mind at ease a little to have an actual plan in place, rather that to just be horrified of the possibility.

Having a 'do it yourself' system is bad.  If players are allowed to pick their perks, and all perks have the same value, then the best would always be picked.  

A better system is for perks to have costs.  Like Homefront, different perks cost more than others and some costs less. The problem with BF is balance through equalization.  For example, a thermal scope would cost more than a red dot sight, but in BF they 'cost' the same.  If the thermal is better, than there is no reason to pick the red dot sight. ","1409530604"

It wasn't really that I thought they'd come shoeless, but moreso me treating them like bridesmaids dresses and wanting to see them ahead of time to ""approve"" them. Now that I think about it though, shoes are probably not going to be what people notice in photos!

2. Oh, I didn't really want a bachelorette party. My bridesmaids were the ones who wanted one more than I did. It was regarding dates for the bachelorette party. I'm going to copy+paste from another comment: It's not really about having the bachelorette party. I don't mind if they don't throw one actually! It was moreso them not communicating to me about when the date is, because of other scheduling needs I have to meet. :( Because everyone is out of town, and people are flying in different times, literally, the only days that could work for the bachelorette party are Friday morning/afternoon and Saturday. However, because my dad wants to meet my groom's family, and they're also flying in at different times, the only days that could work for that are also Friday morning/afternoon and Saturday. I've asked them to give me a date so I can schedule the other thing, but all I've been hearing are, ""We dunno! We're still deciding the best date!"" But maybe I should just schedule the family meetup and tell my bridesmaids, ""Sorry, this is the only date that works because I've already scheduled this other event.""?

&gt; At this point, there needs to be a regulatory body to enforce a level playing field bringing new competitors to the market. Once the monopolies have been destroyed and competitors can survive market downturn, then deregulation may be possible.

If you remove the choke hold companies like Comcast/Verizon &amp; co. have local ISP provision by removing all national and local regulations that favor them, that would change things pretty fast. No need to enforce a level playing field. Google Fiber and other startups would eat up the market in a matter of months.

Would you stick with crappy Comcast if you had the option to switch to Google Fiber or another ISP? If this provider started to throttle your Netflix connection, how long would you stick with them?

The market has a beautiful way of self-regulating itself, but of course big business and government hate that and do everything they can to limit your choices and jack prices up.","1409530610"

I'm unaware of a single player, at any position, who wins games all by themselves. Every single championship team has a complete team, regardless of what positions their superstars play. 

The ""game management"" argument is tired. What do you expect a QB to do? Throw a bomb, sprint down the field, then catch his own pass? Maybe Smith should have the one-look-then-sprint style play of Kaepernick? Would that really be better? The best QBs in the league have targets at WR and/or TE.

(edit: the user ""volkerdi"" is Patrick Volkerding. ""Recently"" probably wasn't the right choice of words, I meant more recent than the often quoted interview the same place)

I am not talking about the statement ""Let's not have another one of those threads, OK? Save it for when we switch to systemd.:-)""

But the general gist of what he is saying here and what he has said before (he has never rejected systemd, just said he was sceptic).

The point is that Patrick V. is pragmatic enough to change to systemd if necessary. I am sure that he would have preferred another init-system than systemd, but his main problem is, that no one seems to develop an alternative to systemd. Slackware simply doesn't have the manpower to do so alone.

So IMHO, it is only a matter of time before Slackware changes to systemd. It really isn't such a big deal except for a few fanatics that they change to systemd, and it will really make it a lot easier for Slackware maintainers in the long run.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Honestly, it sounds like you and him both have your guard up...but that you both enjoy eachothers company and have fun together.  The age gap could be a little weird for him, since you aren't old enough to go out to the bar with him.  But that will soon change :)  I don't think it's that you want him to decide if you want to keep having sex, rather that you want him to say he only wants to see you.  You've explained it perfectly here!  It's scary, been there!  But telling him what you've written here is perfect.  Either he can deal with it and be cool, or he isn't right for you (at least right now he isn't).  I was with a guy and we did THE SAME EXACT THING.  Played poker every Thursday at the local bar: followed by drunken messing around, which was fun... more the companionship than true feelings though.  We never had the 'heart to heart' but we both knew we were just messing around and it wasn't 'in it too win it' style.  Maybe he means (by saying you don't ask him for enough) that he wants more, but is scared to say it... just like you.  Go for it girl~the worst that can happen is that you're no longer confused and can move on.  On a plus side, he might just be scared to make the scared 'real' move.  One thing you should always be is true to yourself... if he's worth it, he won't care if you say 'I'm not good at this, and it makes me uncomfortable... but...

"vegan","t5_2qhpm","In some ways I agree with your first point, that in order for any life to exist, other life will inevitably suffer. There are certain aspects of it that I do disagree with and I beleive it ended up being very short-sighted. 

&gt;We ought to be incredibly responsible, but since animal death for the benefit of humans is not something that can be practically avoided, we shouldn't suffer so that other animals don't die.

I think the issue with this is that in order to have your current lifestyle (assuming you are the average first-world citizen) you can't be responsible. Your food travels all around the world and is sprayed with environment-destroying pesticides. Your packaged food is made with products such as palm oil which is grown, in part, on land which used to be the home of chimpanzees before is was burned down killing many of the inhabitants. Your beverages come from companies that purchase the fresh-water rights in poor countries, taking the water away from the local inhabitants and shipping it to you. None of this is side-effect of simply trying to exists as humans and accidentally killing some animals. All of this is a focus on meeting the demand people have as consumers in the cheapest way possible, and killing anything that doesn't align with that plan. I agree that if you are being attacked by an animal, it is morally permissible to kill that animals, but we kill animals for no reason other:

1. We are hungry
2. We don't want to be sick
3. We think they would make good clothes
4. We need to take their habitat to make more room for people to live in houses (generally by destroying their homes)

Can you really say that the reason we kill animals is so that our species can survive and thrive? Reason #4 is the only questionable one because for a human to live somewhere, even just building an above ground house with no foundation may collapse some underground dwelling of another creature.

In terms of health, if we look at things on a per-species basis, can we really justify using one species (non-human primates) as a way of testing drugs for humans? Is it really morally superior to breed or capture living creatures of one species to see how it will impact another species knowing perfectly well that the test subjects may suffer? I would say that it is more morally sound to test on those of the same species, otherwise, you are destroying others for your own benefit, which isn't at all responsible. 

I think that people should look at their views on this subject and then imagine how they would change if a superior species arrived on this planet. A species that would burn down our homes to make room for their own or, who found that testing medicine on humans could save their species from dealing with negative side-effects of drugs. Certainly, those who say it isn't a requirement of intelligent species to make decisions based on how they impact other living creatures and focus on reducing the harm they do, even if it means drastically changing their lifestyle (maybe even reducing population), would quickly change their minds when they were the ones being put into cages for testing or forced to live on farms until it was time to eat them. Cows, chickens, pigs, chimps, etc... may not have the same understanding of self, or the same emotional depth as humans, but they do suffer.

For the second point, I don't know if humans are inherently speciesits or not, but I can definitely believe it. Just like racism, humans fear that which is different and wants to preserve what they find familiar. Does that means that it is always the best decision? I wouldn't think so. Given the choice between a chimpanzee or a baby human with a severe mental disability, I would always chose the chimpanzee. Though the chimp will never do something that greatly impacts the world, the baby likely won't either but, the chimp will likely have a less negative impact on the world than the baby, making it the logical choice. I also think that we should be making a similar choice every day. Given the negative environmental impact that humans have on the world, isn't it logical to limit our population to reduce our overall impact and give some of our land back to the creatures that originally inhabited it? For the human race to survive and thrive, we don't need to grow the population as big as possible, we just need to live healthy lives in a way that doesn't destroy our habitat.

And nobody is forcing you to change anything. You might reply with some smug edgy response about some Muslim's attacking white people, but the problem with you xenophobes is that you never consider the reverse. 

How many Muslims have been beaten by skinheads in the UK for not ""conforming""? During the white Australia policy, how many Vietnamese refugees were abused, beaten, and scapegoated for not ""conforming "" to being white? Let alone for what occurred in Springvale, Australia by forcing an influx of refugees into one single camp. 

Get over your false sense of persecution you xenophobe.

We'd been cheated out of a contest at Old Trafford the month before when Ashley Young's diving got Shaun Derry sent off in the first half, so none of our fans wanted United to win the league, but we realised that if we wanted to stay up, we'd have to beat City or hope Bolton lose to or draw with Stoke.

We went 1-0, assumed the worse. 1-1 got hopeful. Joey Barton got sent off, assuming the worse again. 2-1, went bat shit! We were staying up. At which point we all heard Stoke had equalised against Bolton. City pulled it back to 2-2 then we all heard that Bolton had finished a draw. No matter what the result, we were safe. So every single one of us started cheering for City. And we all hit the roof when Aguerooooo happened. [(Proof here)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eKdbeFU4h4)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sorry I misunderstood. I was specifically referring to the Roman Catholic Church and I agree that the eastern Catholic Churches do allow married priests. I also agree that they are in union with the Church. However there is much more to the priesthood than preventing moral deficiency. Ideally the essence of the priest should be to imitate the sacrificial and loving nature of Christ to the point where he is no longer acting as himself, but as an alter christus (another Christ) towards the flock he is called to shepherd. I would argue that having two families to serve would impede a priest to fully live up to this beautiful ideal vocation. ","1409530632"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I didn't address any of the points you're making because, frankly, they are not worth addressing. 'Booing should not be motivated by malice' - Wrong. What is booing? 'Boo, I want the other team, my favorite, to succeed more than your team.' You are wishing misfortune on another team for not only your own sake, but also for the sake of the team you support; that's malice, albeit a very benign and inconsequential form. Whenever you actively root for one person/team/organization to fail, that's coming from a place of malice or ill-will.'There are plenty of other sports that do not have booing' - Sure, like Tennis, Golf, and Bowling. What exciting stuff, really. But lets take a look at some of the more profitable and popular sports; Baseball? Check. American Football? You bet your ass. Soccer? Oh, I'm sure you would be able to hear some boos, if the fans turned down the volume on the spitting/swearing/stabbing/rioting/racial epiphets. What are you saying here? Yes, sure, there are some sports that don't have booing in them. Great for them. A majority of the more exciting, visceral, fun to watch and play sports do.'The booing was motivated by Malice, which doesn't happen in most other sports' - Since we've already gone over the malice thing, I'll address the larger issue; how the fuck do you know what ANYONE in that crowd was booing about? You have no clue. If it was solely motivated by his outward malice you seem to be so sure that everyone in that crowd was feeling towards LMQ, then why the FUCK did they go crazy with applause, cheering and chanting when LMQ won? Did they suddenly become not foreign? Was that evil malice lifted from the crowds heart entirely by some outward force? Were Riot employees holding guns pointed at the crowd, holding big signs that said 'Boo and you die'? No. Perhaps the crowd was just really behind Curse who had played well for two games and really wanted to see them sweep. Who knows? Not me, and certainly not you. If you want your points to be addressed, then you should at least first make ure your points aren't thinly-veiled bullshit with no meaning or reasoning behind them.","1409530633"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

Because I remember [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/FanTheories/comments/14r00p/the_office_dunder_mifflin_is_a_front_for_a_drug/) submission which linked to [this page](http://uphillbothwaysinthesnow.blogspot.com/2012/09/dunder-mifflin-drug-cartel.html). It stood out to me especially since so many of the character pictures are the same: David, Michael, Darryl are all the same pic.

It's not a bad notion, the Los Pollos Hermanos / A-1 Car wash idea. The problem I see is that nothing affirmatively supports it. As I noted for the similar theory, it can be applied to pretty much anything:

&gt;  E.G., Strickland Propane is a front for Mexican cocaine smugglers. Mr. Strickland is a constant wreck because of drug abuse and cartel threats. Debbie is a cartel spy sent to sleep with him to keep tabs on the operation. Enrique (voiced mostly by Danny Trejo) is an actual member of the cartel family, who runs the dirty side of the operation. Joe Jack, an admitted felon, is an enforcer. Hank is the only innocent member of the team, kept on because 1) his naivety prevents him from ever discovering the illicit business, and 2) his excellent management generates a real revenue stream for the IRS to be happy with.

Mostly, I think the theory is rebutted because Dunder-Mifflin is publicly traded, which makes using it as a criminal front very difficult. There are also the many times when strangers are invited onto the premises (e.g. Casino Night) that a criminal enterprise would have stopped. ","1409530636"

Killers *are* humans. In every literal and metaphorical sense of the word. I know it's psychologically comfortable to think of them as inhuman monsters, but it's also simply untrue.

With a hat-tip to Godwin's law, and my apologies: Hitler was human. And the reason I choose this example, and not the example of some random cop or school shooter or serial killer or something, is that Hitler wasn't just *human* - to say that would be almost an insult! - he was also apparently a charming and intelligent and dedicated enough politician to get voted into power. That's a scary thought, isn't it? Literally *tens of millions of normal civilians* thought he was a good idea. It's easy to look back in retrospect and say he was a monster, because he did some monstrous things, but nobody noticed at the time.

If we're ever going to prevent a situation like that happening again, it's very important to realise these people are all human. If you want to identify a killer, you need to first stop looking for the scales or the horns and trident, and study the psychology of killers.","1409530637"

What is your impression of the customer base?  Are they wealthy or just very occasional shooters?  Are there a lot of regulars?  That's a ton of money to spend with each pull of the trigger.  

And on a side note, are there are particularly good deals anywhere out there for these sorts of experiences?  

And on a side note #2, are there any great but not too expensive multi-day gun training programs?  I figured that with all the 2nd Amendment proponents there would be tons of non-profits providing tons of free training.  But I see next to none, all I see is 1/2/3 hour classes for $$$.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","They teach 'The Wire' at Johns Hopkins because of how accurately and comprehensively it portrays the socio-economic elements of Baltimore. The entire first season was based on a investigation of [Ed Burns'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Burns) time as a Baltimore detective. The season where Presbo becomes a teacher is partially based on his experiences as a teacher. Omar was based on a real dude. Basically, you should just assume that everything that happened in the show has already and continues to happen in a similar manner in cities like Baltimore. The main reason The Wire is lauded is because of it's verisimilitude. Sure it's entertaining, but David Simon, the showrunner, always had realism as his number one priority and he succeeded. It's truly astonishing that the show is able to so accurately capture the dynamics that exist on all levels of inner city life. I struggle to think of any social class, and their experiences, that wasn't examined, and examined honestly, in the show.","1409530638"

Using your own example, if Congress passes a law and the courts either rule it unconstitutional or interpret it in a way Congress doesn't like, how exactly does the buck not stop with the courts, when the only way around this situation is to start over? The law is what the courts say it is until a different law is passed. And when the new law is passed, it also means what the courts say it means. There's no wiggle room here, I'm afraid. Also, Congress can pass all the legislation it wants to counteract ""centuries of common law interpretation"" concerning constitutional amendments and the courts will chuck every one of them out the window, because the only way to address those interpretations legislatively is through a new constitutional amendment.

Of course, most of what happens in court is procedural, measuring each case against plain text and case law to achieve non-controversial results. The courts aren't in the *business* of making law, but when a case touches on an area that requires clarification that's exactly what they do.

You're right to claim that Congress was formed as a ""preeminent"" body, at least in the sense that it was meant to be the driving force of the public will. It was granted key powers to that end, such as the purse, making laws (naturally), declaring war, and so on. But checks and balances were put into the system for a reason. And you can talk all you want about how you *wish* the law worked, but in the real world, interpretation of the law to any meaningful effect falls on the judicial branch. ","1409530642"

**Robbery** is having something taken from you by force, usually in a face to face situation - This includes being ""mugged"" or ""jumped"" in the street, and things like robbing a bank or a convenience store at gunpoint.

Someone entering your property and stealing your stuff is **burglary** - Your empty house can't be robbed.

It's odd that OP fails to mention any kind of intervention on her or the schools part.  

&gt;I asked him once why he was always so mean to this one sweet little girl in particular;

This story is either fake or she is the worst teacher ever.  I hope she just happened to leave out that the school psyche people are keeping an eye on and talking to him.  If he is oing this kind of shit at this young of an age that's a bad sign.  I don't know if intervention would help completely, but it's gotta be better than nothing.

&gt;The __ČZ 75__ is a pistol made by [Česká zbrojovka Uherský Brod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%8Cesk%C3%A1_zbrojovka_Uhersk%C3%BD_Brod) (CZUB) in the [Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic) that has both [semi-automatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-automatic_pistol) and [selective fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_fire) variants. First introduced in 1975, it is one of the original ""[wonder nines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Nine)"" featuring a staggered-column [magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magazine_(firearms\)), all-steel construction, and a [hammer forged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge) barrel. It has a good reputation amongst pistol shooters for quality and versatility at a reasonable price, [*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] and is widely distributed throughout the world. It is also the most common [gun in the Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_politics_in_the_Czech_Republic).

"hivaids","t5_2sabe","I don't think it's an emergency that you start. If you have the time and motivation, you should check out how to apply for your state's ADAP program before you get home, and figure out how to get meds even if your insurance through work takes some time to sort out. If there is some way to ensure continuity (like if Spain would give you three months worth before you leave, giving you plenty of time to get something else started), then I would start meds as soon as feasible. The CD4% is actually a more accurate indicator of immune state over time. The absolute CD4 is an extrapolation based on your total number of all white blood cells using the percentage, meaning, that 870 is 21.6% of all your white blood cells at that moment. Your CD4 count is high, though, which is great, and your VL not too crazy. So, in summary, I don't think you have to start immediately, but I would immediately start organizing how to start ASAP when you return. I wish you the best!","1409530645"

Lapel isn't as pronounced but you could always do the 3-2 roll and have a tailor/dry cleaner iron the crease in.

Barbour has the [bond](http://www.barbour.com/us/all-collections/mens/waxed-jackets/beacon-sports-jacket/p/MWX0007NY92L) jackets that are a light enough jacket that the aesthetic fits.  However they're pricey and waxed canvas so the fabric will look much different.

Sorry these are the things I know off the top of my head, to aid in your search you may want to try terms like safari jacket/blazer, hunting jacket/blazer (maybe preface with classic to avoid the puffy camo variety), photographer jacket/blazer (probably get a lot of Express hits for their blazers which aren't the style you want).

Hope this was of some help.

My Aunt owns a few rental properties, and she got someone in with a fake reference.  They leased for a year, and she tried to get them evicted for no payment after month 3.  The tenant turned up in court, said he could only afford £50, and the magistrates said that it signalled intent to pay and denied the eviction request.  6 months later after more legal battles, the tenant left, with all the copper piping, anything and everything of value, whilst completely trashing the place.

"archeage","t5_2sf59","Well, a healer really only has one damage spell: Antithesis. Since it has like a 4 second cooldown and does pretty mediocre damage, is sucks for heals to solo with only the damage skills. Even with Witchcraft, your damage won't be improved much. For casters, I would recommend either Sorcery or Occultism for doing damage solo. Up to you what you wanna swap out for what. You can only ever level 3 classes at once, so if you want to solo but also level Vitalism and Auramancy, you'd swap out Witchcraft for a more damagey skill. If you can level with a group, awesome. If not, you need to be able to solo when your buddies arent around. I hope that makes sense :X","1409530649"

The Muslims started it way back in the 700s when the Umayyads took over Spain, some of France, until they were stopped by the Christians. Then the Christians slowly and very painfully took back spain over 1000 years. There was the issue of Constantinople, where the Byzantine Christians were invaded by the Islamic Caliphate. The Crusades of the Holy Land were simply a small part of this whole thing. They were brutal and cruel, as is any war, but it wasn't like ISIS.

ISIS is far more one sided - it's trained soldiers vs minorities. The Christians, Shia, Yezidis, etc are not part of an Empire. This is much more comparable to Stalin, as the other commenter said, or to the genocide of minorities in Nazi Germany. ","1409530651"

 [**Cush drive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cush%20drive): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;A __cush drive__ is a part of a [motorcycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorcycle) or [scooter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scooter_(motorcycle\)) [drive-train](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-train) that is designed to reduce stress from engine [torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torque) damaging other components during gear or throttle changes. A common design used by almost all street motorcycles, it has three major pieces: the wheel, the sprocket assembly, and the rubber damper. The wheel and the sprocket assembly fit together with five or more sections much like two hands woven together. In between the contact of the two assembly are rubber blocks. This makes it so the wheel and the sprocket have a dampening layer between them, and the rubber blocks reduce wear and fatigue of the metal assemblies. Another popular system incorporates metallic compression type [coil springs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coil_spring) placed between the input and output shafts of the cush drive assembly.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","That last point isn't hugely relevant.  The equivalent NC gun is equally incapable against all targets you listed and has a hugely diminished effective range - after all, it *is* a shotgun.  The TR equivalent weapon can apply damage to any target but is relatively ineffective at range (actually a problem with both TR vehicle secondaries).

By contrast, it is only *slightly* less innately durable than the prowler or vanguard and indeed it is only with a shield that the vanguard gains any particularly significant edge.  Balancing that is the fact that the vanguard is giant and slow and as such it's going to end up taking more hits than the magrider.

The slow projectile is a solid gripe though but, by my estimation, that's a necessary concession.  After all, the only thing that keeps the magrider from being the unquestioned lord of armored combat is the fact that they can't lay effective fire at long range because if they could you'd never win an equal number armor engagement simply because you'd take silly casualties just moving AV weapons close enough to lay effective fire.

Personally, I think it's a pretty balanced platform all told.  Obnoxious as hell and the personal bane of my existence as a harasser driver but nothing particularly out of place.","1409530657"

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","The Empire was able to exert it's authority throughout the entire galaxy.  It had fleets of star destroyers, millions (billions?) of soldiers and very competent fleet command

The destruction of the DSII only eliminated the head of state.  There were governers (like Tarkin in A New Hope) who wielded absolute authority over the sections of the galaxy that they controlled.

There may have been a short struggle for power once the emperor died, but the Empire would most certainly endure.

I see two real situations

The Emperor is dead, but the governors decide to segment the Empire and rule their galactic holdings as individual empires

or

The empire remains intact.

If the governors become individual rulers, I see the rebels convincing former Imperial governors (and their power) to join the rebel cause.  This would basically escalate the Galactic Civil war to gigantic warring sides rather than a handful of rebelling systems versus an unbeatable enemy.  So the war is now RAGING instead of just a few skirmishes.

in the intact empire scenario I see the plot surrounding a power struggle where the rebellion would try to use the shakiness of leadership to their advantage and try to take down the empire from within doing very little outright assaults on imperial holdings, but instead doing mostly espionage, sabotage and infiltration.

Either way I think it would be pretty cool ","1409530664"

I didn't dare move or give any sign that I was awake (not wanting to come off like a creep listening in on them having sex), even though I really just wanted to put my headphones on and forget this ever happened.

On the other hand there are obviously (I don't read your or any reply along those lines as '*All* Germans lack *any* form of humor') Germans with a great sense of humor. I like to think of most my family and surroundings as quite funny, and especially into sarcasm. I even find that many people from other countries don't respond to 'our' sarcasm, some better some worse. Often Americans were kind of puzzled when people made sarcastic remarks because they took them serious.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I did the math previously, though I didn't save it. Basically, starting from the late 60s, when minimum wage was $1 and running until today, the minimum wage should be about $8 today. At the time of the last increase, it was high enough. A wage increase to the proposed $10.10 would be sufficient for almost a decade. 

There is two problems with trying to raise the wage in line with inflation. First, is the fact that inflation rises almost instantly, with the new minimum wage devalued as soon as it normalizes. Second is the fact that if we were to raise yearly, to combat the first problem, we wouldn't know how much to raise the wage until after the year.

Considering those facts, I would say that the wage has been basically in line with inflation.","1409530670"

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The young pop star practically leapt into his door as the fan girls amassed behind him. With a kick, he shut the door. He then locked it, then barricaded it, then sent his guard dogs in front of the door, and wait.

Gradually, he stopped panting. ""Damn,"" he said to himself, ""One day, you're just a normal kid. Then you get a girlfriend, you kiss, and BAM! Nothing can hurt me,"" the pop star took a swig of alcohol, to soothe himself. Unfortunately, it did nothing. He sighed, then threw it out of the window. Like ants to a cracker, the bottle was out of sight in moments.

""I'd have thought she was a nut,"" he mused as he reclined on his chair, flipping the television on to a news channel. ""Saying how she was immortal, and others could become one themselves if they kissed them,"" he shook his head softly. ""Being immortal may be the shit, but when everyone wants to kiss you-even your parents,"" he shuddered, knowing he wouldn't have to complete the thought.

Several hours passed, and he watched everything from television movies to the news, which oddly enough, focused on the hundreds of thousands of people in his general area, swarming the house, forcing the military to drive them back, though in the end, they gave up and joined the hoards of fans themselves. Once he heard pounding on the door, the young pop star decided it was time to hide further. 

He walked to his bathroom, opened up the mirror, and typed in a code. A trapdoor opened up, the stairs and walls pure, unadulterated stainless steel, and trod down the steps, cool on his bare feet. Behind him, or I guess, above him, the trapdoor opened, leaving only the lights more than ten stories beneath him to guide his way. He was exhausted when he finally made his way down, collapsing into a bed, darkness encasing his consciousness in mere moments. The pop star drifted off into a peaceful sleep. Or so he thought.

CRASH!


""He's in here! Get 'im!""

""Oh my God, I want you to have my children!""

He heard glass bottles break, jackhammers drilling, even gunfire entering the room. Then he saw it. The hoard. The storm. The wave. Whatever appellation it may have had, it was massive, leaving the pop star only enough time to put some clothes on before he sprinted off, into an exit, out into the real world.

""F my life,"" he said to himself as he ran.

Because if you do, you could be the coolest girlfriend in the world by purchasing a gift for yourself! (You can tell him it's for him if you want.)

There is a magic product called a Clash Pack.  It comes with two decks of roughly equal power level that are designed to be played against each other.  It is intended as an introductory product.  It also includes instructions on how to combine the decks together to make a single stronger deck.  

Here is the link to it on amazon for $22: http://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Card-Game-2015/dp/B00KXY3NS4

If you decide that this is something you want to do, then before you give him the gift, You should download the Magic 2015: Duels of the Planeswalkers for Android or iOS (Free to download).  Go through the tutorial and you will know the basics of how to play.  Then, your boyfriend will think that you are a quick learner when he teaches you to play!

Anyway, it would make for a few fun hours/date night activity, and even if you don't continue to play yourself, you would come away with a better understanding of this hobby your boyfriend likes.  (If you do end up doing this, please follow up and let us know how it went!)","1409530675"

You might have more of an argument if Norway was at 65% our GDP,  but they're doing better than we are.    Really,  think about that.   Really, better at *everything*,  other than ipods and retired millionaires.

I hear ya,  they have oil and that's huge,  but the US has incredible natural resources,  even when accounting for our huge population,  we're just good at frittering them away to connected ""risk takers"".    In California the state charges 14 cents per barrel of oil extracted!    And that huge population?    It's there due to government policy -- 80 million immigrants and their children.

Another thing,  many times the ""risk takers"" aren't really taking huge economic risks.   They're just the best at greasing palms,  sucking down taxes,  breaking kneecaps and bending rules.

The vet suggested the Dawn soap, she said it may irritate his skin a bit (he was only 8 weeks when the fleas came) but that it would be a lot less irritating than residual flea irritation. Just be careful of her eyes and she'll be ok :) we used a kitty coconut oil conditioner on him after the Dawn. 

We bought flea specific bombs at Wal-Mart, along with the de-flea carpet powder and vacuuming daily for two weeks. EMPTY THE VACUUM BAG AND CLEAN OUT THE FILTER EACH TIME, AND THEN TAKE OUT THE TRASH (can't stress that enough!) 

Also once the fleas are at bay, your kitty may need to be de-wormed, as swallowing any fleas can give them worms. You'll see them coming out of her bum and around where she sits, they look like little grains of rice. Kind of gross but easily treatable.

 [**National Bolshevism**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National%20Bolshevism): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__National Bolshevism__ is a political movement that combines elements of radical [nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalism) (especially [Russian nationalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_nationalism)) and [Bolshevism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolshevik).  It is often [anti-capitalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-capitalism) in tone, and sympathetic towards certain nationalist forms of [socialism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socialism) [*[which?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Avoid_weasel_words)*]. Nevertheless, National Bolshevism is separate and distinct from [National communism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_communism).

&gt;Today, [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) is considered to be the center of National Bolshevism, and almost all of the National Bolshevik parties and organizations in the world are connected to it. Amongst the leading practitioners and theorists of National Bolshevism are [Aleksandr Dugin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aleksandr_Dugin) and [Eduard Limonov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduard_Limonov), who leads the unregistered and banned [National Bolshevik Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bolshevik_Party) (NBP) in Russia.  Influenced heavily by the idea of [geopolitics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geopolitics), current [Russian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia) National Bolshevik movements propose a merger between Russia, [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) and parts of Asia, in a union to be known as [Eurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia).

&gt;The [Franco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France)-[Belgian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium) *[Parti Communautaire National-Européen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Communautaire_National-Europ%C3%A9en)* shares National Bolshevism's desire for the creation of a united Europe, as well as many of the NBP's economic ideas. French political figure [Christian Bouchet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Bouchet) has also been influenced by the idea.

I was just trying to get an idea of the easiest section. I was leaning towards BEC, but per a Becker download I was able to locate, it recommended taking the BEC after audit. So maybe REG is the way to go.

I will definitely keep in mind to go by the book rather than the experience I have gained. I can see where there might be a breakdown between the two and greatly appreciate the advice. I will go by the book to a 'T'.

I was unaware that Becker offered the study guide in sections and will definitely take my research a step further in this regard, especially since so many people I know have used Becker. 

Thank you again! I definitely will heed your advice! I love to hear about people experience and how to conquer this beast!","1409530683"

The real fans still remember the irony of how sceptical and critical people were about the change to 3D.  Now, Nintendo are scared to get their hands dirty and fans generally want it to stay that way.  I mean, who else in the internal team would oversee the project? Their US division ended up making 'Hunters.'

I'd be extremely happy if Retro were to make another game, but it would still be great to see Nintendo (and possibly Team Ninja) be given another fair shot at refining what is was a nice concept, sans garish storytelling and dodgy characterisation.  Maybe Retro will finally get their third person Metroid, like they were attempting in the first place.  All I want is for either of the companies to focus on innovation and/or refinement and produce a game that's both unique and polished.  'Other M' felt and looked incredibly half hearted and that was without the clunky storyline.","1409530686"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Problem is inflation data never really measures the amount of inflation, but much rather the velocity of money. StatsCan isn't off telling us how much the money supply increased but much rather the effects it has had on the economy. 

Economists spend all this time talking about how inflation is a good though. Isn't that all just theory? We have never seen a country in an industrialized age that lives in a deflationary economy. I still buy cell phones, TVs, computers, the only thing that are deflationary in this economy. The device I hold in my hand not all the money in the world could of bought 10 years ago. But at all buy the tech knowing our dollar is worth more tomorrow in respects to technology. 

This is why people created Bitcoin, it's not about getting  rich, it's not about funny Internet money. It's about a protest, the People's opposition to monetary policy. Opposition to a crowned corporation controlling our economy, and opposition to  monetary policy. Bitcoin, although an experiment, it is still the ability to opt out.

"unitedkingdom","t5_2qhqb","&gt; You're suggesting that there's not going to be an EU vote

Depends if the Tories win the next election or not. Even then I'm not convinced it'll happen. 

&gt; that the power to set Scottish income tax and benefit levels haven't been signed up to by all parties?

We've been lied to before in exactly the same way. In '79 it was the former PM that was making the promises &amp; they were promptly withdrawn when his party took power. 

What's the point in controlling the income tax anyway *when it goes into the same big HMRC pool*? Do you think they'll let us drop the level and contribute *less* to the UK? There would (quite rightly) be outrage in England. So in essence they get the power to raise the tax level and pay even more into the next big London infrastructure project. Wonderful.

WRT benefits, who's pockets will a possible increase come from? If it comes from local taxation or Scotland's block grant then they can already do that e.g. as is the case with the bedroom tax.

These new ""powers"" do nothing for me, a super-light version of Devo Max with none of the real advantages of it. We want to be able to invest more into our crumbling infrastructure instead of helping a super-rich foreign bank build a skyscraper in London via tax breaks greased by party donations.

&gt; Which, of course, independent Scottish politicians would never do

Sure, they will have the usual bullshit, but I don't see how that affects the argument here. If our politicians follow the Westminster model and take bribes to provide incentives for foreign investors then at least the money will be spent in Scotland!

&gt;  if you're going to complain about a lack of details, but then simply 'not believe' any when they're listed

Weird but cool: sometimes i dream about people other than myself, or have dreams where i am not the focus of the story(sometimes i think that iw as watching or participating in someone else dream but probably not) both of the times i can recall at the moment were featuring a girl, one was a super powered one with a white hood(in this drema i may have been turned into a girl for some weird reason though) and she was triying to avoid capture and notice by authorities hunting for her and her kind.

In the other not myself dream, the girl was some kind of ambassador for the human race, on a space station and we were trying to get a spot on the council of whatever for humantity. there were alot of weird races, which included starwars strangely enough as one of them. like the galactic empire.

I once dreamed it was a zombie apocolypse(once? hah try like twenty maybe twenty thousand) and i was fighting zombies but got infected, becoams a super zombie, went on a rampage killing other zombies and super mutants and humans. i was the baddest super mutsnt of them all, but at zsome point it turned into robot suit vs robit suit battle and i won but iwth injuries.

HUGE increase in celebrity tie-ins and former workers coming back for gimmick matches.  CM Punk would have left sooner, younger stars would have had too much pressure put on too soon.  The implications from there are hazy, but I doubt we'd seen much of NXT and definitely no Network if all that happened.

But I might be giving WWE's yearly reliance on Taker too much credit; I can say for a lot of fans I know it was the only reason to watching WrestleMania the last several years.","1409530690"

basicamente, ele vê com ceticismo relações, especialmente políticas, com qualquer país que não tem tradição democrática (inclusive alguns do brics, rússia e china como exemplos).

ele acredita que a europa é o exemplo mais avançado de um convívio entre nações e portanto o brasil deve dar prioridade a uma aproximação com a europa.

o último ponto do plano sobre internacionalismo é ""não sustentar países como eua, rússia e china politicamente e dar mais sustenção a ONU"" e também deixar claro que ""o Brasil não apoia regimes ditatoriais e teocráticos"", baseado no pacifismo.","1409530690"

We eventually made up, but then the big betrayal happened. I tried to sit down with her for lunch one day and a bunch of her other friends started telling me how she liked to make fun of me behind my back, in addition to them making fun of me themselves. I started crying and they laughed at me. 

My best friend watched the whole scene unfold without saying a word. Finally, she got up, muttered something under her breath in her native language, and started to make a run for it. I called after her and tried to chase her, but she snapped at me not to follow her. 

That was the last time we ever spoke. It will be 10 years this fall since it happened, and I've never really gotten over it. Those incidents are the reason why I have not been able to trust others. 

People generally see me as a really likable person and try to get to know me, and I'll entertain them for awhile by allowing them to be my friend. But there always comes a point when I feel like they are trying to get *too* close to me, so I'll cut them out of my life. Ideally I'll cut them out of my life without saying a word, but a few of my friends have been so persistent that I've lost my temper with them and said hurtful things so that they'll leave me alone. 

However, there is one person whom I genuinely trust and enjoy being friends with. We share common interests and she generally keeps to herself, so I never worry about her encroaching on that invisible boundary that would normally cause me to push people away.","1409530702"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Can you understand how people get annoyed about that kind of stuff though...? Have you been to Vegas? There are these people who stand on the street slapping pamphlets to their hands trying to hand them out to people. You probably don't want to see the pamphlet, and you've heard their story (prostitutes) a thousand times... it really starts to piss you off eventually that these people are everywhere you like going, handing out these pamphlets for stuff you've already determined you're not into. And that's you. You're that guy, slapping a pamphlet to your hand, not on a Vegas street and not offering prostitutes, but that's still you, out there... trying to pimp an idea to the masses, handing out pamphlets about what you're selling, and many people you hand it to, which have departed from interest, just throw it away.","1409530704"

"cs50","t5_2s3yg","Thanks again yeahIProgram, that was indeed my problem.  I fixed it and I have the correct file size on 049.jpg of 182272, I checked the file with gdb and it closes the input and output files and returns 0, and exits normally. Valgrind finds no leaks and 0 errors.  However, when I run it through check50 I get the dreaded ""unexpected end of input"".  I have read the posts on the subject and in one of them glennholloway mentioned that if the program is slow it could exacerbate the time out problem with check50, I do not open the file with each iteration as he mentioned in his example,
http://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/comments/2cqgs7/pset5_recover_constantly_getting_unexpected_end/    but I do have error checking whenever I open a new file inside the loop.  Just to find out if that made a difference, I commented that portion out and recompiled, ran it through check50 and it passed with all green smileys.  So now my questions is:  Should I submit with or without the error checking in the loop?  ","1409530704"
