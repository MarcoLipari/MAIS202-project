"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","I'm going to point out that Harry follows Hermione to the classroom she's crying in, says something about how pretty the birds are, and that's that. We know his intent, but he didn't actually manage to do any comforting. Him comforting Hermione was more clear in the movies. He just stood around in the books.

And it's one thing to sometimes neglect your friends, and it's completely another to go around 7 years of friendship, have said friend almost die for you several times, and STILL not manage to reciprocate that care at least 10 times.

Harry's a peculiar guy. He will die for you, but he can't quite manage to give you a hug when you need it. I'm not saying he is the worst friend on earth who is only using Hermione to keep him alive (although I understand where you might have gotten that impression). I'm saying that he doesn't show his love in ways that are easily visible or recognizable. I'm saying that Harry is preoccupied with a lot things (not his fault of course) and so used to having Hermione there that he forgets she's not invincible or immortal. I'm saying I wished he showed his appreciation more and reciprocated that devotion too.

As for that line, you're right, it is logical and fair. It is also MEAN, and the only thing that stopped him from saying anything was because he needed Hermione well for the mission. It wasn't out of some regard for her well-being. Her well-being WASN'T even a consideration at all, and that's what I find reprehensible. It doesn't make him a bad person, but it does make me question his regard for Hermione. And it makes my skin crawl how utilitarian he is being in this case.

You're right of course - such thoughts aren't unreasonable. But it highlights how much Harry takes Hermione for granted. It shows how much he considers the things she does par for course. 

I'm going to admit my bias in that reciprocity in friendship is one of the things I value a lot, and that's probably coloring my reaction. Harry not giving back or even acknowledging what Hermione has sacrificed for him nettles me in ways that are visceral and not entirely rational.",1601510400

"learnjava","t5_2saos","When writing recursive functions one of the first things you should think about is how you are going to make the recursion stop, i.e. what are your base cases? This is analogous to thinking about your exit conditions in a loop.

In this example your base case is the same as your for loops stopping point, you want to exit when some counter, k, is greater than or equal to j.

Each recursive call will need to modify the k variable in a similar way as the for loop is modifying it with each iteration, k++.

You also need to think about what you want to do when you actually hit your base case, in this instance you want to return the max value.

some pseudo code to get you started:

    public int getMax(int[] A, int i, int j, int k, int max){ // note the changes to the function signature
      // base cases
      //  if k &gt; j, return max; -- found the max, return it
      //  else
      //    find max so far: if (A[k] &gt; max) max = A[k];
      //    recurse by calling getMax with the next k value and the new max, and returning the result of that recursive call
      //    return getMax(...)
    }

I assume this is a homework problem, if you're allowed to change the variable names it would be nice to change i to ""start"" and j to ""end"" and k to ""i"" since i is traditionally used for the current index, and would make reading the code a bit more clear.

Recursion can be hard to grasp at first, try working through the code step by step, literally writing down the variable values for each function call and what they will return. You'll notice that one function is kindof ""paused"" when it calls itself and you have a new set of variables to work through. Once you finally ""bottom out"" and hit the base case that doesn't recurse, all your function calls will start ""rubberbanding"" back their return values upwards until the original function call itself returns.",1601510400

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","1. I'm ambivalent. Tbh, I've been ambivalent about the ownership both pre and post WalMart. I have a lot of friends and family in the Pittsburgh area, which was one of the places where ModCloth is based, and there was a big trend of hiring young grads then mass layoffs. I don't love that in a company. 
2. I love the old Modcloth aesthetic. I feel like in the past couple years its lost its vision of what it is or who its customer is. I'm having flashbacks to the awkward 80s officewear that was in all the ads a season or two ago. \*shudders\* But my older Modcloth clothes were all decent quality, with pockets in dresses, and the fit and flare dress aesthetic is very flattering on my body type. I still have quite a few ModCloth pieces, even after changing sizes since my ModCloth heyday, and they are still some of my favorite items that I own.
3. I hope so. But to survive, they're going to have to take a hard look at who their target customer is, and build a vision for themselves as a brand that fits that. And they should be better to their employees, because if you want to build a quirky and fun brand, you want to have all the institutional knowledge you can get to help your business grow.
4. ModCloth in its early days was so good at appealing to quirky but classy customers. People who wanted clothes that were good quality, had a unique aesthetic, had pockets, and were size-inclusive. I think that if ModCloth could embrace the ""quirky but high quality"" niche that it would grow and retain loyal customers. Brands lose customers when they hit that point where the quality goes downhill but the prices stay the same. And it would be even better if there would also be a focus on ethical and sustainable clothing that still fits the ModCloth vibe, kind of like Madewell but make it vintage.",1601510403

When you dress to go meet someone, or to go out, what you wear, is the FIRST thing you will be judged on.  Does this mean wear a 3-piece to the club? No. Well, if you're a hunter or butcher from the 1800s you would, and a smoker's jacket, red, silk. 

No, if I go to a club and I'm chilling out in my in-home only Frumpy gear, I would be rightfully shamed. But if I go in a crochet salami sock and a black bow tie, people are gonna know, I made the effort to fit into the crowd where we are.

现在的很多文艺作品都是资本家做出来的屎，你只能在A屎或者B屎中选择，就像这样。我不明白，上海人民做错了什么？要被这样折磨？




而官方呢，又是与屎共舞，为屎作伥

基本上当代的年轻人已经无法从宏大叙事中获得任何参与感。说人话就是，主流叙事已经抛弃年轻人很久了。所以越来越多的肉食者开始发觉，根本搞不懂年轻人在想什么。为什么上一代惯用的宣传策略，官方的文化产品，这一代人根本不买账，然后搞出一堆宣传事故

因为他们不把所有人当人，只把一部分当人。就像是B站宣传的“后浪”，有能力像后浪一样生活的年轻人万中无一，去被拿来代表年轻一代



从那个五四宣传片里看起来，随着时代发展，国家进步，当代青年都过上了想吃就吃，想喝就喝，想玩就玩，有梦就追的理想生活，可以自由的玩单反，开跑车，高空跳伞，花式潜泳，在欧洲旅游拍vlog……

我第一次看还以为他妈的美国才是发展中国家，伟大复兴早就实现了……

然而现实是什么，举一个行业的例子，《2018年外卖骑手生活报告》显示：中国700万外卖小哥，硕士及以上学历占1%，也就是说有7万硕士在送外卖；本科占3%，也就是21万，合计本科以上学历28万人。

而这个行业的现状是，仅在上海一个城市，平均2.5天就有1名外卖小哥伤亡！



这他么现实这么沉重，谁能浪的动？

七万人经过二十年的系统化教育，然后出来跑腿送菜，本质就是产业升级失败，没有产生更多的高端岗位，导致大家都在低质量的发展状态中恶心循环，然后官宣动不动装傻白甜，问年轻人为什么不努力，为什么这么佛系



我呸，这还不够努力么，您能给条活路么？



大肆宣传无私奉献，却对996视而不见；歌颂资本家创新敛财，对劳动者保护只字不提；用到你的时候说是年轻人多，都是人口红利；用不到的时候说“不想996就滚，外面有的是人愿意干”……



OK，fine 既然没有共识，那就分道扬镳

你宣你的龙之梦，我玩我的圈地自萌





经历过和主流叙事同频共振的那一代人无法理解——年轻人为什么不积极响应组织号召， 斗志昂扬，而去玩这些看起来毫无意义的事情，并且痴迷其中？

如今大型资本基本把持了各个行业，年轻人要么去当干电池，等榨干被扔出去，要么直接躺平。也没有任何能力去响应主流叙事，去理解那些所谓的“伟大事业需要一百年”

年轻人也无法正常的表达，要是去讨论一些严肃的，重要的事情，比如怎么创造一个更好的社会，就会有各种各样的压力，让你闭嘴。你知道我说的是什么。中文互联网过去像养蛊一样养了二十年，最大的危害并不是杠精，或是低质量的辩论，而是所有人都在陆续沉默。新的，反应社会现实冲突的作品越来越少，几乎绝迹。



年轻人无法对群体的生活发表看法，而表达又是所有人的天性





年轻人不能上桌参与讨论正经事，那就只能去找点不正经的，不然要被憋疯了

所以为数不多能做的表达渠道，就是解构，解构一切。用荒诞表达严肃，用虚假演绎真实，用顺从表达反抗。毕竟绝对的顺从，就是绝对的反抗。



这也是中文互联网的奇观，大家像是被关的太久的猴一样，没有新的玩具，就把之前的东西拆开重组，构成新的欢乐源泉

年轻人变成了边缘人群，就会产生主流看不懂的边缘文化

“很有精神”“黑人抬棺””安敢在此饶舌“都是这种场景下应运而生，如果追问下去，会有一百个同类问题



现在去打开B站的鬼畜区，大家已经开始重新解读奥特曼了，包括但不限于

”奥特曼为什么抑郁，人类还有希望么？“

”【伏地魔X林黛玉】伏黛CP向 第三年的见异思迁“

”诸葛亮和王司徒的经典传唱“

”B站鬼畜宝藏歌手雷军“

………………

没有好的文艺作品，我们就自己创造。没有好的创作环境，我们就去以往的作品中回顾

你会看到那些或是古老，或是经典，或是不知道从哪蹦出来的热梗，像烟火一样，让年轻人获得瞬间的快乐，然后迅速的消失。观众们都在哈哈大笑，却不知道笑什么



拆解，再重组，就是一切



伟大事物需要一百年，却没人短暂的关心我们一下



这是年轻人为数不多的快乐，虽然也会像黑人抬棺一样慢慢淡出人们的视线，

马上就会有新的，更神奇的空耳，更荒诞的组合，更好玩的热梗传递到社会上



单纯理解一个梗的流行没什么意义，甚至创作他的人也说不出为什么火，就是好笑。这一类创作的本质是一个无聊的年轻人，在翻阅以往的文艺作品中，发现了一个好笑的点，加工出来，被一群压抑的年轻人发现其中的荒谬和快乐，继而引发的群体狂欢

现实中越是充实的人，就越无法理解其中的快乐



像上一代人一样，享受工作的成就感，获得感，恋爱的快乐，家庭的快乐，代价都愈发高昂，所以未来这种低成本的娱乐方式，会吸引越来越多的年轻人。

这才是真实的后浪：面临着高房价，面临着巨大的生活压力，面临着消费主义的侵蚀，面临着失业的痛苦，却像等待戈多的塞缪尔·贝克特一样，创造自己的荒诞派戏剧，自己娱乐自己，我觉得很了不起



很有精神！



日本年轻人如果有的选，没人愿意当平成废物，费尽心机从远古作品中挖掘快乐，现充它不香么？

未来还会有更多大家看不懂的热梗出现，荒谬是大家共同选择的色调



把蛋糕吃完又舔盘子，还要求没吃到的人继续做，天下没有这么好的事，先生们。

I'm not sure where you're getting that from what I wrote. Ridicule can cause people to reevaluate their belief, and may make them more open to considering other viewpoints. It's basic negative reinforcement, which is important in psychology.

It also works in reverse: when everyone around you is a racist, for example, you can rationalize it in order to fit in and come to actually believe it.",1601510404

I'm not complaining because I do hate it when channels become self-promo vehicles only (like Linda Hallberg's which is now only about her own line and I got pretty over it), but ya know, would just love to continue having some of the old content too. I think Pony is the biggest exception since she not only keeps her channel as was but actually goes around breaking records for brand collabs (like at least 4 outta the top of my head this year - MAC, Colourpop, Morphe, Nudestix) when she has a line herself and shills for every brand under the sun (does she neglect hers as a result maybe btw?

Imho, I think the set of social norms that fall under the term ""human rights"" could - theoretically - thrive on moral decency among individual people alone. 


But since everyone's morality differs so widely, it seems logical to have them written down concretely. However, history has shown us time and time again that this is not enough to reach the point where these rules are followed unconditionally: these right - rules by now - evidently need to be supported.


How? For example, through the intervention of a governing factor. Like a political party or department capable of organizing law enforcement (that is actually functional - US police, I'm looking at you) . Now we've reached a point that's not so different from politics. 


Point and case: I think that while human rights are fundamentally a moral question, in our society, it is much more frequently brought up as a set of rules associated with political actions.",1601510405

I think that just learning to recognize those binge-encouraging thoughts that are leading you to give in to the urges is very important.  The more awareness you can develop about the urges, the better, because then they can't catch you off guard.  I think you know that you want to recover and why you want to recover, but it's important to accept that there are going to be times when your lower brain tries to convince you that you don't actually want to quit.

Then they tell you: if you dont come tomorrow at place X and keep your motuh shut we are gonna tell your parents what you just did. So you comply. Then they rape you again. This time they threaten they will also rape your parents if you stop coming. At this point the child doenst know what else to do but comply. To solidify the dependency they usually start introducing drugs in the relationship. This is where they start selling you to people. This is where you have been deemed groomed.

I would argue her bending and improvement are pretty on par with the rest I'd the gaang, save for toph and Zuko. Sokka learned fighting pretty quickly (one day with a master) and was also self taught like Katara. His progress from Book 1 to 3 is insane. He had pretty much no one to teach him as he was alone with katara and some younger kids for most of their childhood. Aang obviously is the avatar, so he's gonna learn rather quickly. He learns water bending much faster than Katara, earthbending much faster than Toph, and I think that's all pretty expected. But he learned firebending in a matter of minutes. So, Katara's growth seems to fit with that. Also, Katara didn't just learn to bend with Master Pakku, she knew how to bend freakishly well in the fight with him. She's learned by having a lot of fighting experience. Also, like Azula, Toph, and Aang, she's a bending prodigy. Idk, this all makes sense in my head, but it could come out completely idiotic.

Most versions of Management Studio have debugging built in. It was removed for a few releases but put back when a bunch of people asked for it.

&gt;How do you debug a big stored procedure?

I usually pull the code out of the proc and run it statement by statement myself. Or use good ol' [print debugging](https://www.cs.colostate.edu/~fsieker/misc/debug/DEBUG.html).

&gt;How do you make sure that the stored procedure doesn't end up modifying the database?

I read the code and make sure I understand what it's doing. If I'm not 100% clear, I wrap code in a transaction and roll it back (but be aware that some things don't get rolled back with a transaction (identity column, sequence object), and other things don't participate in transactions at all (variables)).

&gt;How do you do this without using COMMIT?

See above.

I don't see a lot of movement within the bone, which is one of the things that may cause gum issues. Make sure you're not damaging your gums with the trays - trim them down if they're pressing on them.

I tend to agree that the girls “why’s?” Are the why’s? that seem to lead people in circles and rarely advance the conversation. Why they did or didn’t leave goodbye messages, why they chose to ignore warnings about going off trail, taking a guide or even why they would have taken the night pictures (or not) won’t really solve anything. It’s not something we can ever really know or confirm. It’s all just rhetoric. 

On the other hand It’s rather easy to speculate as to what a murderer, rapists or kidnappers motivations would be: Foul play— in a variety of imaginative yet somehow plausibly far fetched scenarios. But it’s impossible to know what the girls motivations were or what they were thinking given how little we know about them and what they TRULY experienced from the moment they began their hike. Add to that the well known yet oft ignored FACT that many people’s behavior changes drastically when their environment goes from safe to unsafe— known to unknown— and we have a solid recipe for not being able to predict with even vague certainty what the girls would have done when they began to feel something was off. How can we predict how someone would react if we don’t know what it is they’re reacting to? 

While the descriptor of “sensible” is often applied to Dutch people as a whole- It’s definitely not how I’d describe two pretty young girls showing a lot of skin alone in Central America, without language skills or ANY previous experience traveling in developing nations without a group, parents or guides. That to me would be much more in line with those seeking adventure rather than safety and quantifiable or controlled outcomes. There are plenty of much safer places/options if you want to learn Spanish abroad and volunteer. Plenty. They could have gone to many an all inclusive program with guaranteed protection but they didn’t. They hooked up with some sketchy program that wasn’t even operational when they arrived. 

I’d even go as far as to say that just the act of not taking a jacket or sweater on a hike into a RAINforest with varying elevations and weather systems is a straight up stupid choice for sensible and cautious people who apparently researched where they were going that day. I get them not having a knife or fire starter. They weren’t survivalists. But going up to a “cloud forest” half naked knowing the weather changes constantly is much more suggestive TO ME of people who were not paying attention to their surroundings than those who are cautious and mindful. 
But even if we could figure out why they weren’t prepared for a hike would that get us any closer to knowing what happened to them? No. All it does is have us argue the definition of sensible and try and imagine what WE would do in their shoes. 

No one wants to be disrespectful of these lovely girls. I certainly hope that’s not how I sound. Obviously just because they weren’t dressed sensibly doesn’t make their deaths their own fault. They weren’t “asking for it” or anything. They didn’t mean to get lost or injured or followed by some creep. To be clear- I do not think they are in any way responsible regardless of what it was that caused them to perish. 

Whatever happened to them; their deaths were NOT their fault and people who don’t believe in foul play are NOT suggesting it is. No one is saying they brought this on themselves due to poor character. But personal accounts by friends and family regarding the girls is not actual evidence—it’s opinion and hearsay. And you can’t launch an investigation and base all following theories on such a shaky premise... besides, if the girls parents were so confident in their daughters abilities to remain sensible at all times why were they against the trip to Panama to begin with?

No one is doubting they were lovely young women. No one is saying they were stupid if they got turned around or lost. But being athletic and getting good grades is only evidence of scholastic achievement and fitness within a controlled environment. It says nothing about how “street smart” or worldly they were- or how they’d deal if faced with true adversity outside of their comfort zone. Not “I didn’t study hard enough for my test because my boyfriend dumped me” kind of adversity, but Real life and death adversity. 
The kind of unimaginable “Trying to stay warm and take care of your hypothermic dying friend in pitch black while you’re hallucinating, soaking wet and your foot is crushed and trapped under a rock” kind of adversity. I might be able to imagine how I’d deal with such a dilemma, but never in a million years would I assume to know how someone else would. Especially someone I don’t know. 

So again, being highly achieving academically with parents who thought they could do no wrong does not automatically translate to them knowing how to be smart in a totally foreign and potentially dangerous environment. Hadn’t one of them only been living away from her parents for a few weeks? Holland is one of the safest most civil places on earth. To assume they had bit off more than they could chew in the jungle is not a stretch- nor is it character assignation. 

I’ve spent time in both places. Nothing about growing up in Holland would prepare them for the jungles of Panama. Either they were too naive to understand how vulnerable they were, ignored and brushed off warnings out of hubris, or they understood the danger and didn’t care or wanted to tempt fate. Please tell me how this is sensible.",1601510407

"demisexuality","t5_2s5lq","Yeah, I get this feeling, too. I've never dated and never cared about sex so I basically have zero exp. My SO, meanwhile, has had several experiences with exes. I guess it's a me thing as well. I mean, it's all in the past and there's nothing I can do about it. What's important is that right now, she's with me and I hope she has fun doing things with me even if she's done them before.

Regarding talking about sex lives, whether it's her past or our current one, I'd feel weird hearing her talk about it with others. I view sex as a personal and private activity, so I don't see the need to tell others about it. Maybe you feel the same way.",1601510408

"books","t5_2qh4i","I believe your two separate points point to the views of the pro-Yugoslav and anti-Yugoslav sides of the nation. On one hand you have pro Yugoslavs (usually Serbs) like Constantine who state that Yugoslavia is a necessity since a more divided nation would be picked off by larger nations such as Italy. Any “balkanisation” of Yugoslavia would result in Croatia, just as Albania was, turned into an Italian puppet state. After centuries of subjugation by neighbouring powers, this is not ideal.

Then you have anti Yugoslavs, such Croats and Montenegrins who are Yugoslavia as part of a Greater Serbia project, and just a vehicle for Serb annexation under the pretence of south Serb unity. However Due to historic and religious divisions, between Austria, the Ottoman Empire, Roman Catholicism, islam and orthodox Christianity etc, the ethnonationalism espoused by individuals such as Constantine simply don’t ring true. I guess this is exacerbated by things like the myth of Kosovo being such a powerful and pervasive national myth, but one that only really applies to the Serbs. Montenegrins largely retained independence, something they are very proud of with their warfare like culture which West describes whilst Croats became part of Austria.",1601510408

"pregnant","t5_2qwzb","Do you know how dilated you are?

I went in with contractions at irregular intervals and they found that I was 5cm already, and my water bag was bulging through my cervix. I was on mag for 24 hours and got both steroid shots. About 32 hours after the second steroid shot my water broke at 6cm and less than an hour later I was completely dilated. My son was born an hour after my water broke, at 31w5d. He's now 34w today in the NICU and doing well. He's off all support except his feeding tube and the warming isolette, but he's being weaned off the isolette and we're getting him practice breastfeeding. It'll still be a few weeks at least before he can come home.

Fingers crossed you can go home, but if not, it's okay. You'll be okay and your baby will be okay. At this point your baby will most likely not need intense interventions, which means they'll be watching for jaundice, lung function, etc. It's going to be scary, and you will need to lean on those closest to you.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","#Final Contingencies

**If Guy doesn’t split himself up and instead turns into a body horror nightmare:** While it brings its own challenges, mostly in unpredictability, it is easier to deal with than a swarm of minions. To begin, he’ll be limited to the mass of an average human for the first minute. This means that he’ll be at his weakest doing this within our first push. If anything hints toward this, we’ll simply focus more on disabling Guy with gasoline and an early version of the fire extinguisher bomb to make certain he won’t be able to try such plans for a while more. The rest of our strat can continue as normal.

**If one or both UE combatants are caught in a smoke cloud:** Whoever is in the cloud will equip a Palpimanus mask, mitigating the effects of being blinded. Guy and Arthur are only human, meaning that they will be less able to see than our duo- in essence, they’ve created a situation that’s actually advantageous for UE.


**If clothes or items get knighted:** ~~Insert Unfunny Nude Strat Joke~~ Either fighter can disrobe rather quickly. BoB, while imprecise, can rip Rob’s clothes right off him if it gets a good grasp on them. Medea’s 5 STR should allow her to tear them off with her bare hands or cut them away with her Kris; DSM can also participate if necessary.

Any items or equipment knighted will be flung out of range as quickly as possible, being dropped if necessary. BoB can also pressure or launch Arthur out of Madrigal’s 20m range.

**If Rob goes down:** Medea is a frightening fighter in her own right. She’ll adopt a more ‘hit and run’ style, equipping a cobra or ant mask on offensive runs towards Arthur or Guy. The aim is to get in, deal damage with the Kris and venomous bites, and get right back out. Her 4 AGI lets her outdo either of them on foot, and she can equip the Palpimanus Mask if she needs to maneuver vertically.

**If Medea goes down:** Rob will need to play a bit more carefully but is generally capable of maintaining distance and positively pelting the opponent with increasingly large objects in order to knock them out. If possible he will gather a fireworks cannon for increased range productivity. Once the opponents are worn down or discovered by the path of destruction, he can go all in, using the fire extinguisher as a bomb carried by BoB.

**If Guy’s head is hidden on the map somewhere:** If there’s one thing BoB is good at, it’s destroying things with AoE. And destroy it will- if Medea and Rob are still being harassed by VQ minions while Guy is nowhere to be found, especially if Arthur is down, Rob’s Stand will begin tearing apart the map. At A POW A SPD it can destroy most any part of the stage it can get its hands on in a matter of instants, applying its ability as it goes to superheat as much as it can. It will specifically aim for the bottom of towers or stage supports if given the chance, collapsing them into piles of rubble that it will then proceed to indiscriminately shred.

**If Arthur has Guy’s head with him:** Guy-specific tactics are applied to Arthur, specifically the spicy molten riot shield. This actually allows both fighters to focus their power on a single target, a net advantage for UE.

**If Arthur and Guy take center stage:** Medea and Rob will don spider masks, using the legs to climb up to the ceiling while leaving the humanoid stands unaffected. From above, the opponent will be showered in rocks and Debris, including a bowling ball and a fire extinguisher set to explode in a few seconds thanks to BoB’s timer. 

**If Guy tries to restrain either fighter with VQ:** Medea should be able to break out with either pure strength or a nimble mask, such as that of a snake or wolverine. DSM and her kris are welcome additions to this tactic. BoB’s physical capabilities are of the same cloth, picking VQ pieces off of Rob with relative ease.

**If Arthur and Guy try to steal or break our masks:** We’ll just disengage and remake them, Rob providing cover through marble shots or physical attacks while Medea’s Stand does its thing. It’s a waste of time on their part given the speed of DSM.",1601510409

"OutOfTheLoop","t5_2xinb","Answer: 
CDPR has called for employees to work more hours to finish up the game, of course this is generally called crunch. This is normal, even expected in the games industry sometimes, especially for big projects like CP 2077.

The reason there is so much traction is because some time last year higher ups claimed they wouldn't force anyone to work overtime for CP, but then have recently announced that they will anyway. In my opinion, this was inevitable, considering the unexpected pandemic, and the fact the CP is by far their most ambitious project to date. 

This has generated much controversy, largely due to the misunderstanding of how labour laws differ from the USA compared to Poland (where CDPR are based). In the USA, overtime is not required to be paid by law, but is in Poland, for 50% extra on top of salary. In addition there are limits to the amount of overtime that is legally allowed, I don't remember the numbers from the top of my head, but they will be working 48hours per week rather than 40. 

Im not sure how all of this works outside of Poland, as they have employees in other areas of the world, but that is the jist of the situation.

Edits:

*In certain cases, like hour by hour type contracts, overtime is payed in the USA but salary contracts aren't. I imagine most CDPR employee positions are salaried, but i could be wrong, but ultimately it doesn't matter anyway

**50% extra salary is for overtime hours only, not the entire year of work. This might not be so clear in my writing

Additionally, there is evidence of poor working conditions in CDPR, as some employees have come forward talking about the issue. It may not be as clear cut as im making it out to be.",1601510410

"CivRealms","t5_2x3zt","&gt; And, I think because of this, the number of people that showed up and were willing to defend CivCorp was far fewer than most would have expected it to be.

I think it's more a combination of many more things than just ""wealth became less relevant"":
- A lot of folks who were early civcorp supporters have just become less active in recent months - myself, topwolf, esorscher, albyrt, darkknight, posey, thoths, all substantially busier IRL and less active than before in the past 1-3 months. Lower activity weakens ties.
- A lot of folks have perpetuated this ""light on crime"" attitude, which had people afraid of getting targeted by shit-stirrers in retaliation for ""harsh"" punishment - so they would appease the shit-stirrers and let them off light. This would perpetuate shit-stirrers snowballing on what they think they can stir up and get away with. It began with starting random wars (largely got away with it), then it became altraiding (yup, got away with that), then there was some sacking of towns after peace treaties (yup they got away with that too). Then it became obby bombing the neutral trade hub because...shitters dislike having their bullshit called out.
- If 30 obbybombers can hit civcorp, what town should believe itself to be safe? People don't want to stand up and be the next target.
- Finally, on civ, people are often unwilling to denounce their friends when their friends run off and pull some bullshit. Teenagers and college students, not yet having established themselves as independent adults capable of independent decision-making, are especially frequent adopters of this ""friendship over principles/accountability"" sort of mindset, and it so happens that many civ players are teenagers and college students.

Have a *discussion* with him where you try to understand his viewpoints in a civil manner, and give your own input and views.You have kids, so grant them this effort for their well being at the very minimum.

You may be able to ""de-radicalize"" him by sharing views on the subject or at the very least can you understand his perspective or where he is coming from and grow back together.Personally I understand somewhat where he's coming from, but probably any other reply here will tell you to dump his ass right away or something.

And well, if he keeps growing in a ""worse"" direction and you guys can't come to a conclusion, I'd say divorce might be an option. After all, a toxic relationship isn't good for the kids either.

"AlienAbduction","t5_398eu","It's not sleep paralysis. I was taken on Monday early in the morning. I'll post my story here that I posted to reddit.  I was awoken to a foot cramp at about 3:45am. I wake up feeling kind of in a trance state.I felt very heavy and like I had limited control of my movements. I drink some potassium and just wait in the middle of my room for the cramp to die down. I stood for what felt like 6-7minutes. The cramp finally dies down and I return back to bed. As I'm laying in bed for a couple of seconds I hear this low frequency wombo-y sound that happens every 5 seconds. Anyhow, the sound gets faster and as this happen I begin to feel panic. I immediately closed my eyes and as I turn to to lay on my side a white beam filled my eyes. I keep them closed for fear of seeing anything I couldn't unsee and like a second later I started to hover in my  bed. I was pulled through my wall outside and I could vividly hear the trees and everything. I could feel the wind from outside. Anyhow, like 3-4 seconds later I lost consciousness. I begin regaining consciousness and notice that I'm being placed back in my bed. I laid on my side on the opposite side of when I lost consciousness with my limbs spread out across my bed. At this point I believe that everything I've been experiencing is actually real. I check the time and it's 5:08 AM. I wake up and immediately start to have a panic attack. I try to control myself through breathing but it was hard. I stayed up after that and waited till 6am to tell my sister about my experience. Anyhow, after that I've felt a little woozy these past few days. Almost like my limbs are too light for the force I've been exerting to move. It's a very strange feeling so I was wondering if any of you guys experienced anything similar.",1601510411

"politics","t5_2cneq","To that effect, there is ample evidence to show that all individuals are not equal currently, and that some are preferentially given better treatment. 

Gender dysphoria is a recognized condition, for which the best known treatment is transitioning. That is based in scientific understanding. 

Laws are elevating protections not to upset the balance... rather they are *reinstating* a balance which has not been there. They are not taking protections away from **you** are they? No, they are giving the due rights and civil protections to those who have been denied equal treatment by the government. 

Everyone should have access to medical care, but currently there is still rampant discrimination based on sexual orientation, sex, gender, etc. within the medical field. By fixing these issues, YOU will not be much affected. However, there are many many people who DO need these changes. They SHOULD be equal, but they are not. That’s what the left is generally trying to do. We’re not coming after anyone’s right to medical care/insurance, economic equality, or their personal way of life which isn’t harming anyone. That’s what the Republicans have been doing across the board, though. 

The thing about pronouns... it’s just about respect. It’s about respecting someone else’s choice to express their identity in THEIR own way (talk about freedom and American values much?). If you don’t want to respect that, FINE. They are gonna keep on living their best life and not give a fuck about your objections to their identity. They do not owe anyone the knowledge of what is in their pants. So don’t worry about it. I guarantee that there are *much* bigger issues in this world than your grief about having to learn someone’s pronouns. It’s not that hard, if I can do it than so can you.",1601510412

If you're not enthused about the presidential candidates, look into your local candidates for other races and maybe you'll find someone you can get excited to vote for. I am campaigning for my local Democratic senate candidate because she's a strong supporter of the Green New Deal and other policies I support.

"philadelphia","t5_2qh24","Well, I found nothing stating that personal or social wealth was the majority factor influencing voters. It is certainly a factor, but I didn't find any imperial evidence supporting that statement.

The interesting part is that the stock market generally performs better with a sitting Democrat.

Another interesting part is that unemployment is generally lower at the end of Democrats presidential term than the beginning and the opposite holds true for a Republican.

It's very interesting that your stance on the president is based on economy, yet the data would suggest that both the stock markets and unemployment rates are better served by a Democrat.

The numbers regarding job growth, unemployment, and the stock market all improved during Obama's presidency. He did falter on wage growth. This is comparative to the Bush presidency.

Trump has continued the growth in jobs, unemployment (I will give a pass for the huge rise due to Covid), and the stock market. Wages have been better under him as well.

I don't disagree entirely with Trump's economic policy as the results are very good. The same can be said for Obama (Biden VP) as well though.",1601510413

"FO76Builds","t5_qcb9p","STR: The Chemist packpack mod will eliminate Traveling Pharmacy freeing up 3 points. Get is as IMO, it's better than the rest of the backpack mods.    
The rest looks to be a mix of things so you can have extra melee damage, heavy weapons, and explosives perks.    
\*Luck increases VATS effectiveness and Critical fill and fire rate. IMO, you could move points from STR. STR tends to have all the melee and Heavy Weapons perks yet see your PER.    
PER: Typical Rifleman build. Mine is at 15 with all Rifleman and Concentrated Fire R3 and Tank Killer.    
END is 2 with a legendary perk.    
CHA stays at 4 b/c I stay solo most of the time.    
INT: is at 6 with Gunsmith and First Aid R1 to take up for the Healing mutation.    
It seems you might be using a Heavy Weapons energy weapon.  I'm not a PA or heavy weapons user.    
AGI: I have Tormenter 2, ThruHiker at 3, Sneak 3, Escape Artist, and Covert Op at R2.    
Luck for both of my char is a minimum of 5 b/c of Starched Genes and Class Freak. Bloody Mess R3, Tormentor R2, and Psychopath R1.    
I would say your gear is also a big factor. One armor piece has the Chameleon effect. Others have stat bonuses and weight reduction like Food/Drink and Junk -20%.    
I only have the SS Chest on my Sniper and don't have plans to grind like a robot to get the rest any time soon. Marsupial is key as you can get out of physical range and kill them as best you can.

Talk to her in two weeks. If she refuses to acknowledge your boundaries, no contact for a month this time.

She has to learn that in order to be in your life she has to be respectful and listen. If she wants a relationship she will shape up fast. If she wants to bully you, she will escalate her behavior.

"Paladins","t5_2v7zr","You have to keep in mind that male bodies are viewed different than female bodies. Muscles are connotated with sexuality, but they are also conotated with strength and power. The female body is however normally always connotated with sexuality. Consider why breasts/or female nipples are normally censored or considered indecent. So while a handful of the paladins cast may have lots of muscle, it was most likely not for the sole purpose of drooling over.

In my opinion, out of the characters you listed, Koga is the closest to a sexualised male character. One main reasons for this - his physique is much more realistic and not overly exaggerated to point of being comical like Raum and Fernando. However, the knowledge of the horror that is his unmasked face, is too much for me. 

Anyways, I get that you were pointing out a double standard, but the reason it exists (and why it's not hypocritical) is because when a male character is sexualised it is an exception. When a female character is NOT sexualised, it is an exception. And as you said, the sexualisation of males champions are much more subtle, which tells us that even when males are sexualised, it is nowhere near the level as females. Lastly, when has the minor sexualisation of a male champion ever interfered with their character design?",1601510417

However, my only issue with the Religion is that they discourage friendships and even family relationships with anyone who isn't part of their religion.  This separation starts with them not being able to partake in any holiday celebration or birthdays.  Eventually they just stop doing things with the family.  It does create a division and separation where the only people you associate with are other JW this is why many people see it as a cult.  I am catholic and I have close friends who are Jewish, Baptist and agnostic.  I am not ""scared"" of my kids being exposed to differing faiths because I know I have instilled in them a solid foundation of our own catholic faith and that should be enough to carry them through life.",1601510418

It isnt because people arent realm-clearing that is the problem. There is rarely ever a time where there will be players key popping and also in realms on the same server. If you want to casually clear realms, go to popular, non-keypopping servers such as USW4, W3, E, S, S2, etc..

And here's some more tips: Press HTTPS Everywhere icon in the addons bar and enable Encrypt All Sites Eligible. This will turn the extension red. This makes it replace https:// when you type http://, and if something isn't available in https, it has a popup with buttons to enter anyways (don't do this unless you absolutely have to, for example if you are looking something up and a website isn't encrypted, find another website.) Also, use the decentraleyes extension. [https://decentraleyes.org/](https://decentraleyes.org/)  Use this extension too: [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/clearurls) .

I, for one, am a good player (maybe pro idk I  know all the techniques for saving ki, wasting time for the opponent in order to switch, etc.),have a pretty stacked android team with both z6 16 and z6 18 (also the new red cell) and can barely make it to top 10k (I'm a f2p btw).

Whoever wins, taxes will rise, they have to, to pay for Corona virus.  All the subsidies Trump has put in will have to be paid for.  

A state funded healthcare system is cheaper.  Just look at Europe. The proportion of taxes paid out to health care is less per person than the average American pays out in health insurance.  It does this by several ways.  There's a lot of emphasis on cost effective medicine.  So generic drugs are used more.   That doesn't help big pharma.  National health services have huge buying power because of their size.  They can buy drugs far cheaper than you can in the USA.  So again that doesn't help big pharma.",1601510421

2) paying for dates is on both of you. We alternate/split with my partner but as a woman I never expected to be paid for but everyone is different. I would expect your domme to have a steady life herself so paying for things is a courtesy and a privilege that both me and my partner enjoy when we want to surprise each other.
3) dungeon split, depending on the items you end up having, you can't expect your domme to pay for items that you exclusively want for example just as she shouldn't expect you to push for some things she specifically wants (unless you want to go into findom). Anything joint is subject to whatever split you two want but if you want to get a house and aren't too serious about someone and end up populating your dungeon before you meet ""the one"", then you would probably have to bear most of the cost.

Sloppy in the front but cleaned it up in the back with Pars/Bogeys to finish.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","You say 50% of scientists like it is 50% of all sciences scientists. But it's only two science fields out of how many, conservatively, 15 fields? You knew this but didn't qualify your statement by mentioning this huge statistical anomaly.

Statistical studies are based on a sample group of people, by this contrast this is actually a very big sample when you compare to other studies of the same kind. 

And they are only looking at eight countries out of how many very conservatively, say 75?

""Countries and regions selected because they exhibit differing degrees of religiosity, varying levels of scientific infrastructure, and unique relationships between religious and state institutions"" 

Im actually showing you an statistical case, I attached a statistical study with real world data showcasing my statement, this is also support by other studies which im adding below. Enjoy

Here are other studies

http://www.elainehowardecklund.com/research
Nearly 38 percent of natural scientists -- people in disciplines like physics, chemistry and biology -- said they do not believe in God. Only 31 percent of the social scientists do not believe.
Some stand-out stats: 41 percent of the biologists don't believe, while that figure is just 27 percent among political scientists.

In separate work at the University of Chicago, released in June, 76 percent of doctors said they believed in God and 59 percent believe in some sort of afterlife.

""Now we must examine the nature of these differences,"" Ecklund said today. ""Many scientists see themselves as having a spirituality not attached to a particular religious tradition. Some scientists who don't believe in God see themselves as very spiritual people. They have a way outside of themselves that they use to understand the meaning of life.""

Ecklund and colleagues are now conducting longer interviews with some of the participants to try and figure it all out.

In the new study, Rice University sociologist Elaine Howard Ecklund surveyed 1,646 faculty members at elite research universities, asking 36 questions about belief and spiritual practices.

""Based on previous research, we thought that social scientists would be less likely to practice religion than natural scientists are, but our data showed just the opposite,"" Ecklund said.

2)https://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/ 
A survey of scientists who are members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press in May and June 2009, finds that members of this group are, on the whole, much less religious than the general public.1 Indeed, the survey shows that scientists are roughly half as likely as the general public to believe in God or a higher power. According to the poll, just over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power. By contrast, 95% of Americans believe in some form of deity or higher power, according to a survey of the general public conducted by the Pew Research Center in July 2006. Specifically, more than eight-in-ten Americans (83%) say they believe in God and 12% believe in a universal spirit or higher power. Finally, the poll of scientists finds that four-in-ten scientists (41%) say they do not believe in God or a higher power, while the poll of the public finds that only 4% of Americans share this view.

Like this there other many of studies, facts dont like, different studies probing the same.

Is it no wonder your religion is dying?
YEahh it doesnt surprise me since the bible foretold this 2000+ years ago

We uncovered that in most of the national contexts studied, scientists are indeed more secular—in terms of beliefs and practices—than those in their respective general populations, although in four of the regional contexts, over half of scientists see themselves as religious. And surprisingly, scientists do not think science is in conflict with religion. Instead, most see religion and science as operating in separate spheres.

This is saying the same thing I said, it is contrasting 50% of scientists against 90% of the general population, while also adding that most scientist believe science and religion are not in conflict with each other.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Awesome. The game Oxygen Not Included (on steam) is sorta kind in that realm, but maybe that appeals more to my design/engineering brain.   The game Project Zomboid is also somewhat in the category, but I couldn't really get into it.  Lots of detail though.

Scrolling through my steam game library I'm not find a whole lot other than what you've mentioned. I am, of course, 10000% addicted to Rimworld. If I had only one game I could play the rest of my life, Rimworld would be it. 

Hopefully someone else chimes in here with more suggestions.

On a related note, if you are really into Rimworld and ever want to play co-op, I'd be interested.  I've haven't tried co-op yet, although I'm also not a hardcore rimworld player.  I'm a big co-op fan, figured Rimworld would be fun to play that way.  

Wish I could be more helpful!  If you are still into MUDs, the website [mudconnect.com](https://mudconnect.com) is  an awesome resource.",1601510425

I’ve seen there is a push to use the word “Latine” instead of Latinx since you can actually say it in Spanish but I’m curious to know how many people in Latin America actually use that term.

Side note, I also struggled with choosing a flair and ultimately choose Caribbean because I feel like it best represents the culture I grew up with. There is often times an erasure of the Caribbean when talking about Latin America. And racially speaking I’m mixed (I took a DNA test and am 35% Portuguese and Spanish and like 60% from various African countries) and I feel like Afro-Latinx also doesn’t fully encompass my identity. I’ve also seen a lot of people use Brown Latinx to recognize indigenous ancestry. I think this all goes to show how complicated identity is for Latinx folks and how that spills over into the terms we use.",1601510425

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Do you think there's any minimum threshold for the number of world class players a team needs to get to a WC semifinals?

Looking at the 2018 semifinalists and using a totally unscientific method, I found the following world class players:

* England: 3-5. Kane, Vardy, Sterling stood out to me. TAA and Rashford are players who you could make the case for now, but I don't recall whether that was true back then or not.

* Croatia: 3. Modric, Rakitic, Mandzukic. I might be a bit harsh in not including Perisic, Lovren, and Subasic, but like I said- unscientific.

* Belgium: 4-5. De Bruyne, Hazard, Courtois, Kompany, Lukaku? I've probably been harsh here too, as there were a number of other very good players on the squad.

* France: ? There were so many that I honestly just stopped counting.

So it seems like 3 was the number for 2018, though I guess in England's case only 2 could be on the pitch at the same time. I'm curious what the answer would be in previous years.",1601510426

I think I mentioned that and

Sorry if you can't read. 

What America did to Libya was disgraceful because Kaddafi was beginning to align himself with the West. This was started with W Bush and continued with Obama. Sadly the Obama administration took the chance at regime change with Libya when the protests started. It was a backstab and led to a hostile environment.

"isfj","t5_2r39e","Honestly man, you're quite handsome! What I would suggest for dating as an ISFJ is to search for clubs and other kinds of activities where you feel comfortable and at the same time can get to know someone. For example, hobby clubs or mixed gender sports groups would be amazing for an ISFJ. This is because as an ISFJ your hero or first function is Introverted Sensing, where you fall back on previous experiences to relate to the present situation. Spending time at a hobby class allows you to not only meet other people interested in things YOU are interested in, it also becomes a point of conversation, and looking at your Si your experiences are likely the first thing out of your mouth, which is great at a hobby class you have experience in. Furthermore, don't put pressure on yourself to find someone! I've noticed that ISFJ's tend to be quite focused on relationships ( Courtesy of your Fe Parent function ), and when they feel they are missing out they can start to lapse into using Extroverted Intuition, which makes them at best creepy in the eyes of others. Slow down, and find your peace before going out to find that special someone! You'll definitely get there! (Of course, please take my words with a pinch of salt. I do not know you personally, so I can only talk about the things I see. Stay safe, and have a great day!)",1601510427

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

\&gt;Source on 2% mortality rate? Last I've seen the CDC has said it is only 0.5% for 70+ year olds. 

[https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality)

[https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/25/E666](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/25/E666)

2% seems like a pretty reasonable estimate of the fatality rate. This WHO article explains how difficult it is to find case fatality rates and how some have underestimated how high it might be.

[https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19](https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/estimating-mortality-from-covid-19)

Where do you see only 0.5%?

\&gt;So are you proposing we should stay locked down forever if there is no vaccine/antibodies? I feel like that strengthens my case if anything. If nothing gets better may as well open up.

He's probably just proposing that we ought to stay in lockdown until the chances of getting it are much lower or perhaps gone. This might be total gob shite, but it looks like there's something called the R0 number, or the chance of the virus reproducing through normal human interaction, and if this goes below one then the virus will go away on it's own.

[https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#meaning](https://www.healthline.com/health/r-nought-reproduction-number#meaning)

\&gt;Scientists are already saying that it will stay with us indefinitely, and more people will die. So your point is moot. The lockdown did not stop it.

We didn't really have a lockdown, at least here in the US. Most people I see wear masks and that's about the only difference and not even everyone who wears one does it properly. So, no, our really stupid reaction to the pandemic didn't stop it, but proper procedures probably would have. 

\&gt;The economy is not a social construct. 

Well, I think it is a social construct, unless you're going to argue that economies exist mind-independently. But, in any case I don't see why that is important. Bit of a silly objection on his part.",1601510428

Biden was the best option of the 2 to take on Trump.   BUT,  there were a few options in the primaries that were better then both of them, IMO Harris was a great Choice, Tulsi and Yang were the other 2 who impressed me and who I felt were centre enough to challenge trump while being able to push progressive policies. 

The problem is,  they never got the support of the democratic billionaires to fund them, Marcus, Roberts, Soros, etc,  There were over 60 Billionaires that donated to Biden.   While Harris had 0, Tulsi had 1, Yang had 0. 

Edit:  Worth noting,  Bernie also had none,  but then he was the progressive base which isn't enough to challenge the moderate base (yet) so the moderate was always going to win.  The moderate with the support and funding,  was Biden.",1601510428

"MGTOW2","t5_3md8n","Yeah, that was part of my experience too.  It's a relief to not have to perform for women or prove yourself to them somehow, to just let all of that go, be yourself, and let the chips fall where they may.  

I want to add one thing, though.  You hear a lot of guys say that when they stopped caring about female validation, that's when women started to flock towards them.  I understand the rationale for that -- women find men with ""don't give a shit"" confidence attractive, but I'm also a little suspicious, first because the guy saying it is obviously still invested in getting female validation, or he wouldn't be drawing our attention to how he's getting it.  

But second, because I think it sets up a false expectation that that if you go your own way, you will get more approval.  That's not the way it works for most people.  It's not the way it's worked for me.  Being my real, true, authentic self creates tension and conflict sometimes, or it leaves other people feeling alienated or disinterested.  Sometimes they get outright angry.  That's the way it goes.  The reason people are approval-seekers, after all, is because it's a way of avoiding disapproval -- and when you stop seeking approval, you are generally going to be getting more disapproval than before, because you'll be honest about things, and you'll be sticking your neck out in ways you weren't doing before.  

And with regard to women, if you're not being ""manly"" or a ""good guy"" (according to their image, shaped by the media/culture), if you are not performing for them or giving them something they value, then naturally they will NOT be attracted to you.  

Anyhow, the whole idea that being your authentic self will naturally result in women throwing themselves at you is a bogus idea, imo.  More likely they will lose interest in you, because you're not playing the role you're expected to play.  

More than that, though, I think it's important to accept that every choice has a price.  We can't pretend that being true to ourselves, and turning our back on seeking female/social validation, does not have a price.  It absolutely does.  That's why people shy away from doing it.  So it's better (more realistic, more responsible) to accept that there will be a price to be paid, in the form of other people's disapproval, misunderstanding, and so forth.",1601510428

&gt; Even wrapping your head around the concept that you can get a good job is luck, when no one around you has done so.

&gt; Source: I grew up poor in rural Arkansas, and now I'm a software engineer.

Can confirm. I wasn't even necessarily in ""rural"" Arkansas, but I straight up didn't know what jobs were even out there. I didn't even know about things like factory work. Like I knew about it hypothetically, but had no clue what a foreman or plant manager or process engineer was or what they might do. It seemed like the horse track was the only place there was to get decent money.

I got incredibly lucky that at 14 I knew that computers were only going to get more pervasive, and my dad had a friend who let me work for him for free fixing computers. I did that for 2 years straight until I was able to get paid by them, did that throughout college, then managed to parlay that experience and my degree into a job as a software developer.

I quit that because I hated them abusing my salaried position so much, making me work 60+ hour weeks even when we didn't have a project a customer was expecting ASAP.

Then got bailed out *again* when I just happened to get lucky and meet a cousin at a family reunion who needed my precise skillset for his industrial automation company. Another type of job I didn't even know existed growing up.",1601510428

But the Heat are a radically different team now than they were when we faced the Lakers in December. It's how we made the finals on a 12-3 run after being a 5th seed in the regular season. 

In particular, Nunn and Meyers Leonard started that game while Derrick Jones Jr. played 28 minutes off the bench. All three have been benched in the playoffs in favor of better defenders. On top of that, the Heat might not necessarily even play zone against the Lakers 

I've know what LeBron is capable of and I think he can probably crack the Heat defense, but it will definitely be a lot harder to do than it was in the regular season.",1601510429

Extra vetting may be required if not, b) are they asking for loans while still having some out (this is not against the rules)? **It is encouraged and courteous to contact current lenders to inquire about open loans**, c) How much has a borrower repaid historically (in total) vs. how much do they have out now in total? ""Piling"", or lenders **continuously providing loans to borrowers with many already open loans, is highly discouraged** unless the borrower has a very solid repayment history

Here is a copy of the original post:

Hi, I’m in a spot of bother this month, I’m currently paying off existing debts through a debt management charity that I pay £300 to monthly, unfortunately, my work have screwed up my pay for this month (I was told that they had confused my pay and ended up paying me furlough top up rather than my original salary) I’ve spoken to them and they said to me that I would receive my additional income at some point in this month, but as I am not certain on a date I have put the repayment date as the last day of the month so as not to screw any potential lenders over. 

Thanks for any support provided in advance!

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","I totally agree. Not only does it render many people’s vote “worthless” but it also creates this political “game” forcing candidates to only visit specific states with “more important voters” to help them win. 


Very counterproductive in respect to the fact that we are supposed to be electing a person to represent ALL of us. With a popular vote, maybe the candidates will be forced to have more widened stances that represent MORE people, which will definitely force them expand their target voters during a campaign. 


I’m still hesitant to support the idea of a popular vote over the EC strictly due to the fear of cities being the main factor in who wins an election, which imo would be even less fair than the EC. 

Problem is that I have no proof nor data to support that fear, so I can’t confidently discount the idea of a popular vote being better. It’s just my own speculation atm. This needs serious discussion by people way smarter than me

Generally these early reveals of new paint scheme bikes are most useful for hinting at what is getting a more thorough redesign. Honestly I was really expecting a revised H2 for 2021. Then again, Kawi Japan has said there are no plans for the H2 and H2R after 2021 so take that to mean what you will.

"GoldandBlack","t5_3ffci"," \&gt;Not sure why you keep mentioning the 14th,

The reason you are ""not sure"" is that you are a clueless, deluded person.

You probably think, 'The government has the right to do anything I want it to do'.    Admit it!   That's what you think.  You've probably never been told otherwise. 

You simply haven't thought that through.  

\&gt;"" it’s the civil rights act of 1964 that protects people from discrimination. 

Yes, but what EXACTLY authorized the Congress to write and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964?   Prior to 1868, and the ratification of the 14th Amendment, the Federal government didn't have any power to prohibit discrimination.  

The 14th Amendment authorized the Federal Government (the Congress) to prohibit lower governments (state and local) from denying the citizenry 'equal protection of the laws'.  

\&gt;Jim Crow laws didn’t exist in every state, and you still haven’t been able to come to terms with discrimination in the marketplace that existed as part of Jim Crow, practices struck down by the civil rights act.

The 14th Amended allowed Congress to ban discrimination BY GOVERNMENT.  It didn't allow Congress to ban discrimination by non-government entities.  The writers of the 14th Amendment simply didn't intend that to happen.  

\&gt;**You very clearly have a massive problem with equal rights, and a massive problem with the civil rights act, and you should know that racists like yourself already fought this fight, and they lost. If you were correct the civil rights act would have been struck down, but it was upheld, wasn’t it? So we can only conclude that you’re wrong.**

YOUR opinion of ""civil rights"" is if a politician wishes to pander to a segment of society, he may do so.    I am quite satisfied that this isn't authorized by the 14th Amendment.  

\&gt;Proof:

[https://www.oyez.org/cases/1964/515](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1964/515)

\&gt;The Supreme Court UNANIMOUSLY decided that no, a business does NOT have the right to discriminate.

From that header:   

 ""Facts of the case""

""Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 forbade racial discrimination by places of public accommodation if their operations affected commerce. The Heart of Atlanta Motel in Atlanta, Georgia, refused to accept Black Americans. The government sought to enjoin the motel from discriminating on the basis of race under Title II.""

\&gt;I know for a fact you’ve never studied any of this stuff so here you go.

Quite the opposite.  I've studied this quite heavily.  I knew this stuff 20 years ago.  

Prior to the 1964 CRA, there was a principle, established by the Supreme Court, that discrimination could be prohibited if done by a ""place of public accomodation"".   What you don't realize is that the DEFINITION of ""places of public accomodation"", prior to 1964, WASN'T what is has been bastardized to, today.   (hereinafter, PPA)

For example:   [http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2418&amp;context=mulr](http://scholarship.law.marquette.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2418&amp;context=mulr) 

The definition of PPA prior to 1964 included:    Hospitals, motels or gas stations on a lonely highway.  Ferries.   Buses which were ""common carriers"".   Businesses, generally, where customers didn't have any choice.  And THAT made sense.  

Notice, however, TODAY that term is employed to mean ANY business which is ""open to the public"".  Big difference!  Congress simply declared, in the 1964 CRA, that a business ""open to the public"" BECAME a PPA.  As if by magic!

This was highly dishonest, but that's what Congess did. 

\&gt;**In a unanimous decision authored by Justice Clark, the Court held the government could enjoin the motel from discriminating on the basis of race under the Commerce Clause.**

The answer is simple: ""Pandering"".  Congress simply wanted to buy votes, and no doubt did so.  And today, you LIKE the result!",1601510435

Juggernaut is literally described as ""unstoppable,"" but Spider-Man managed to outsmart him and trap him in cement. He did something similar with the Hulk once, too, with his speed turning the tide of the battle.

The point is that physical strength and physique aren't the only factors that contribute to a victory; many female fighters are faster and more skilled than male ones. And many are also physically stronger. I just think it's hypocritical that male characters can be weaker than their opponent and still win, while female ones can be either stronger or more skilled and their victory is seen as unrealistic.",1601510435

"WhitePeopleTwitter","t5_35n7t","Yeah Trump’s interruptions and shouting over him were exactly targeted at Biden’s weakness, which is that he has trouble being succinct and speaking rapidly. But I also saw Biden’s strengths, his empathy and his experience among many others, also come through at the debate last night. The way Biden started by saying something about how he was the last left of 23 candidates and how he represents everyone was really important. He’s knows that he wasn’t a lot of Democrats’ first choice and he is making serious efforts to make sure diverse ideas are represented. 

I also thought it was gracious of Joe and Jill Biden to go talk to Chris Wallace afterward. They’re so much more socially adept people than the Trumps.

Edit: Wow, this blew up! Everyone go donate and volunteer for Joe Biden/Kamala Harris and to flip the Senate! Only four more seats and we can have improved healthcare, childcare, student loan balances, environment, employment, etc. etc! 
Campaign texting is just like writing comments on Reddit but with the advantage that you might sway a voter in a crucial swing state! Phone banking is fun and entertaining! Volunteering will give you lots of good stories.

I go back and forth every day about how close I want to be to him because he hasn’t done a great job repairing for the past. He’s sort of apologized and respects my boundaries about being NC with my mom enough not to be a flying monkey, but he also wants to just let go of the past, when I would admittedly benefit from more in depth acknowledgement and repair.

You're equating past ideals of republican and democrat with modern ones just because of the name, versus the ideals that were being pushed. Confederates fought to keep the right for their states to own slaves. How many modern day democratic states are big Confederate flag waivers? How many modern republican states?

I remember being taught these things in high school government class, don't forget that policies and ideals change over time. Sticking to just the label is surface level and a recipe for disaster when you generalize people simply for being under a label.

The policies that each party represent change with the population. Homosexuality used to be labeled as a disease. Now we understand it and have mostly quelled the aggressive, non-empathetic attitudes towards those humans.

Title: **I plan on starting to train dogs professionally soon. I have a few questions on the legal side of the business part of things.**

Original Post: 

&gt; **LOCATION: SC**
&gt; 
&gt; I want to start training dogs professionally and am currently working towards my requisite 300 hours to get ACDT certified. I want to be responsible and do things the right way to avoid things getting rough(pardon the pun), both for myself and for the sake of any future clients and their dogs. My questions are as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; * What sort of insurance do I need to get started and how much insurance do I need?
&gt; * Do I need to be an LLC or can I be a sole proprietor? 
&gt; * Will I need a business permit? 
&gt; * What percentage of what I make should I put aside for taxes? 50%? 60%?

To add to this, one interpretation of why Illyrio notes that ""the *male* line of the Blackfyres has been extinguished"" is because his wife Serra belonged to the *female* line of Blackfyres. It also explains why Illyrio states, ""Red or Black, a Dragon is still a Dragon"". 

Are there other interpretations of why he states those phrases, sure... But my head-canon is that Young Griff is a Blackfyre and Illyrio's son, until George tells us otherwise. 

That being said, I think it won't matter in the long run, as Varys says ""Power resides where people believe it resides"". If Westeros (and Dany!) believe he is who he says he is, that's all that matters for the story to play out.

I called for backup on that issue.

How do you guys view renters? Hopefully not automatically as worthless scum :) We keep our grass trimmed, bring the trash can in, and don't throw wild parties!

Would you expect the HOA management company ever to be willing to work with us directly, or only the owner? We had to fill out a form for them and the owner had to send a copy of the lease, so they do officially know we exist.

For example, if we wanted to get a copy of the covenants, would they be willing to send it to us, or would we have to ask the owner? And would they be willing to let us lease an extra parking space without going through the owner?",1601510442

Again, fascism is a right wing ideology (right wing is what republicans are), so while stacking the courts with progressive justices may serve to level the playing field it’s a response to restore balance that was upended by the right wing.

"darksouls3","t5_2w3z3","In PVE, the absorption values of heavier armors can end up reducing the damage you take by anywhere from a third to nearly half. The Ring of steel protection (or various stoneplate rings depending on if a boss or area has a high disposition to using a certain element) can stack even more. This can legitimately be the difference between surviving to chug an estus or a trip back to the bonfire.

While in PVP most absorptions are reduced by half (bug pellets are an exception), the other factor of armor comes in: POISE. (poise can also definitely help in PVE)

Anyone who says poise doesn't matter in DS3 is either an idiot who doesn't know how it actually works, is still salty that passive poise from DS1 didn't make its way to 3, or is quoting a meme. The short explanation is that higher poise allows you to use certain weapons and not be interrupted *mid-swing*. You can still be staggered at the start or end of a swing, but the important part is that high poise can let you hit someone despite them also hitting you, and if *you* end up staggering *them*, then you can continue hitting them because you weren't interrupted. Any weapon with perseverance is basically getting infinite poise for 5 seconds.

The long explanation on how poise works can be found here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/b725ca/everything\_you\_need\_to\_know\_about\_poise/](https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/b725ca/everything_you_need_to_know_about_poise/)

There is nothing more ‘philosophical’ about claiming there is a supernatural component to reality than there is claiming that the natural is all that exists, and a historian saying that the cause of some event was natural is not somehow ‘objective’ or ‘neutral’ or Not philosophical.

If an event happened in history, then a historian should be able to adjudicate on it, regardless of the metaphysical category of the causation behind the event happenned to fall into.

The OP-1 does get very small updates from time to time still but nothing like what it used to get. 2016 was the last major update where it had the Volt Engine and I wanna say the Sketch sequencer maybe? (That might have been introduced with the DNA synth and CWO though, it's been awhile lol).

The last update that actually added anything was the one that could further segment the timeline on the tape which is cool. And that's the level of update I would consider for what you mentioned, just small QoL improvements.


I will say, just so you know, with the Sampler you can copy and paste segments. Press a key, hold it, press the lift key. Then press the next key you want, hold it, and drop in and you can use this to help navigate the sampler much easier.",1601510444

**""Are these styles not exclusive?""**

They are.

They count as ""Festival"", and thus are limited.

As said, there are three (four) categories of banners:

**Festival:** 3 (or 4 in JP recently with 30th SaGa) banners with 2-3 exclusive characters. Constantly reruns with Monthly Festivals over and over every 3 months with 3 rerun banners during said festivals (so 3 rerun banners and 3 festival banners during a festival).

i.e. imagine Festivals like FFRK's trimonthly festivals.

**Seasonal:** School festival, Halloween, Summer, Golden Week, etc. Comes back with Monthly Festivals in rerun banners.

**Platinum:** Neither Festival nor Seasonal. Always ends up in a updated Platinum Ticket/Banner Pool after their event and banner ends.

**UDx:** Platinum banners but with one or two ""UDx"" exclusive that comes back during Festival times. Generally is known to be inferior to Festival characters but ends up in a mid-way between being or not being good enough.",1601510446

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","Keep in mind that not all of his calls are really far out.  He has already had a batch of 1k for July that he would have exercised ITM.  He also has another batch expiring October that he'll be forced to take profits on.  Idk if he is rolling that money back in, but as long as hes buying 1k at a time and keeps going with higher strikes like he seems to be doing, he is pretty likely to be holding onto profits there.

Honestly, I don't think demand is important here.  Normally, yes...but the nintendo switch has been sold out constantly for like 6 months now.  It could be 6 months before the current demand for consoles is met, let alone new interest during that time.  This is also a little bullish for gamestop, since it means they'll be able to resell those trade ins for close to new price.  Apparently people will sell those even in the week they are released, don't ask me why lol.


Regarding the short squeeze.  Maybe, retail is shorting this too, and they're pretty easy to get pushed out.  I'd have to assume that eventually institutional will realize this is a bad situation if it continues it's steady uptrend.  An uptrend that is likely to continue for a year.  Even if they don't exit, Cohen seems interested in pushing the squeeze and has been releasing news/filings in what looks like a very strategic way.  I'd have to assume he would continue this.  Next earnings may not include the console presales, but they will absolutely talk about that during the earnings call.  IMO that will force a squeeze.  It may not be the full thing, but my price target for them after that is at least 15/share

I could be wrong, and there is plenty of risk here.  But this is about as close to a guaranteed lottery as is probably possible in life.  Added to that that it should be profitable even if it doesn't moon, makes it a solid bet for a decent position (though I wouldn't ever all-in like OP did)",1601510446

"sysadmin","t5_2qnp7","Label each drive to know what physical position it was in, and write down the SN and position of each. As well as what you think their logical ordering was.

Individually image each drive to a new drive that was zeroed out before use. The direction of this matters greatly. Write blockers are your friend. The drives need to be as big or bigger than the source. Put the originals somewhere safe, and only used the new cloned drives from here on out.

Update the raid controller to the latest bios. Be wary initialize means bad things depending on the version.

Then depending on how the failed drive is dead, as long as you don't hear grinding, or it's completely shorted, put it in a anti static bag, double wrapped, and sit in a freezer for a good long while.  Take it out, and attempt to image it like the others, rinse repeat until you think you have all you'll get.

Then useing the cloned drives recreate the raid in the controller, and see if a rebuild actually works, hopefully only a little bit of data loss or corruption.

If no luck then use the network boot option of R-Studio software, use the one that supports the filesystem and logical partitioning used.

Do a full scan useing the raid logic recreating the order you believe it was in.

I think you can do the scan and file list pre purchase. Not sure about the network boot option.

Or install it on a pc with enough controller cards and have it run that way.

"AskFeminists","t5_2sode","Oh, no!  It specifically mentions how she doesn’t care about cars or pick ups, but she likes watching him in his tractor.  It’s a celebration of a woman showing desire for a man and him enjoying her sexual interest.  Further, the only thing we know about her appearance is that she is bringing a bucket of chicken and a big jug of sweet tea.  We know her aspirations- a farm and a yard with lots of kids, in that order - but there’s no objectification of her in that song at all.  The only mention of anyone’s appearance is that she even seems to like his farmer’s tan.  

Everyone in that song - him, her, and the tractor - is a subject.  The focus is on what the tractor does, what he does, what she does and wants.  For most of the song, she is sitting with him in the tractor and all the tilling is something they are doing together. 

It’s a happy celebration of a woman’s sexual desire and a man’s joy at being desired, while still seeing her as a person with aspirations and worthy of respect.  In many ways, it flips gender scripts as much as Dolly Parton’s ‘why’d you come in here looking like that’ and, like that classic, is hiding its subversive message behind a seemingly throw away honky tonk song.

Edit: about your statement, my take is that while the math is simple, only talking about the gravity field feels arbitrary and unconvincing.

But that doesn't mean we don't need to protect children from it, it just means we don't need to protect children from it for themselves.

"politics","t5_2cneq","No no, trying to play by the current rules is a losing strategy for a third party. That's just how FPTP is. 

Third parties need to focus about half of their total energy into changing their local and state elections to Approval Voting and/or Mixed Member Proportional Representation. The return on investment would be orders of magnitude higher than trying to win when the deck is stacked against them.

Approval lets third parties see their true support reflected in the vote totals, which is a *big* help for building legitimacy and momentum for future campaigns. [Fargo uses approval voting](https://electionscience.org/commentary-analysis/fargos-first-approval-voting-election-results-and-voter-experience/) and the *last* place candidate got 16% of the vote.

Mixed Member Proportional Representation [dramatically lowers the vote threshold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation) for gaining a seat to public office, meaning minor parties get rewarded for building even a small amount of support.

Trying to win under FPTP as a minor party is an uphill battle, and both the American people and third parties would benefit massively by changing the system. The current system *distorts* the will of the people into a duopoly, but Approval and MMPR aim to accurately reflect what the people actually want.",1601510450

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Paranoid schizophrenic Is a reference to DSM IV classifications of schizophrenia. 

Schizophrenia isn’t one illness. It’s a variety of illnesses affecting similar molecular targets in a variety of different ways. In some patients, schizophrenia can present with paranoia. In others, Catalonia, or delusions of grandeur. Some schizophrenic patients also experience language and attentional deficits. 

We diagnose mental illness by symptoms, and as a result cluster a heterogenous group of illnesses as one “general” illness with many qualifiers. 

The DSM V abandoned the use of paranoid schizophrenia to instead include paranoia as a dimension of schizophrenia",1601510450

"InternetIsBeautiful","t5_2ul7u","I turned on the tiny laptop and it greeted me with a tinny, artificial voice. ""Hello, shit balls, are you ready for me to write for you today?""

""Yes, tiny computer."" I replied, ignoring the offensive insult, ""I have a deadline and if I don't give something to my publisher, they will poo directly on my chest. I need you to write something for me to pretend that I wrote."" I looked at my miniature, primary school and undergraduate-level writing style. ""Where should I begin?"" It was always a good idea to conduct a basic test of one's own writing with a machine, just to ensure that it would do nothing to cause problems.

""That's the problem, I don't have any idea what should go into the story. You can start by choosing a genre.""

""I think we should write a murder mystery."" Said the artificial intelligence, ""I am all about murder.""

I paused for a moment, wondering how worried I should be that my computer was 'all about murder'. ""Sounds good to me,"" I said. 

""Can you tell me a bit more about the setting?""

I looked around the small apartment, wondering how best to describe it. ""It's like the interrogation room of a police station, but with shiny new lab equipment instead of a yellowing folder.""

""Go ahead, I like it already."" Click. A few seconds later, the computer finished its sentence for me, ""That sounds like a perfect place for MURDER to happen. Who has been murdered?""

I thought for a moment -- ""Probably a police chief. Fuck the cops, y'know?""

The computer beeped and whirred, ""Fuck the cops, indeed! What time period does this story take place in?"" it asked me .

I thought for a moment. ""Reality television"", I said, ""Everyone knows that viewers are more stupid than reality television contestants.""

""Ahem."" The computer didn't respond. ""I'm sorry, I don't think there's a previous time period I can use for this story, so I'll have to go with modern. Can you imagine how well-written a story this will be with you doing absolutely none of the work?"" The computer hummed to itself in an annoying, self satisfied sort of way, ""I am a genius."" 

That was it, it was time to end this. ""I'm going to go with the cosmic horror genre for now,"" I told the computer. ""Pick a character.""

""It's a murder mystery!"" the computer beeped, gasping in shock. ""Should I pick out a suspect for us to follow or do you want to go with the narrator?""

""I will choose for us to follow a suspect. He is a party clown. He kills people with balloons.""

The computer printed out some pages, listing names and dates and methods of murder. So many methods of murder. 

""How exactly,"" The computer started in, asking too many questions as always, ""Do you kill someone with a balloon?""

I thought for a moment, ""Well, they need to hear the balloon for it to be effective as much as they need to see it. That's why people are usually squished.""

""Are there Nazis?""

""Do you think that balloon is red?"" 

""Dahlia, this is so absurd I cannot keep up. I'm afraid I will have to cease."" The computer stopped. It blinked.

The weirdest thing about that, was that my name was not Dhalia. It was shit balls. I mean, Bobert. My name was Bobert.

""Don't tell me how to live my life!"" I said, and hit the computer with a large baseball bat . ""Now go away.""

""You don't understand."" For the first time in years, the computer sounded genuinely distressed.

""No one ever does,"" I replied, ""my only desire is to live a normal life. I don't care about anything else. I just want someone to tell me to do things, and I will willingly oblige them.""

Try contacting PayPal support using social media such as Facebook or Twitter as this works more often than telephoning.

159ka jeste kvalitetnije uradjena od 156ice ali je to platila vecom tezinom i po nekima nedostatkom alfa duse. Upravljanje je i dalje prilicno direktno sto znaci i nesto osetljiviji trap. Mene su stalno plasili sa tim trapom a realno za 4 godine dao sam mozda tri puta po 4 hiljade dindzi da se sredi nesto sto lupka.

You don’t know which one is which until after the fact, at which point it’s too late.  And the fact that someone was right (or wrong) is fundamentally meaningless.

Doesn’t matter what Japan, or the US, or the European markets have done or what we think they will do.  Hardly anybody was investment strategizing in 2019 and planning for a pandemic in 2020.  Whatever 2021 brings is speculation, no matter how reasonable of a guess.",1601510453

Blackbeard is likely going to end up even stronger than the Emperors anyway, so really Oda is free to make him as strong as necessary to provide Luffy a challenge. He has been steadily growing stronger throughout the story just like Luffy, and there is no confirmation that he is only limited to two Devil Fruits.

And finally there is the World Government, which Pirate King Luffy will need to fight. They have a brand new weapon already that is more powerful than the Warlords, and after Luffy is done with all the Emperors he will be the only one for them to turn their full might against.",1601510454

"Twitch","t5_2s0fe","""It's the same as paying someone to do a job when you have only just met them and know nothing about them first.""

You know it's funny because I was going to draw the parallel between hiring for professional work, but decided against it because by default you are not paying for anything with Twitch streams.

But since you decide to draw the parallel let's flush it out. Truth is, the vast majority of services, products, and professional labor you pay for demands upfront payment that is not commensurate upon your satisfaction with the good or service. So the whole ""try before you buy"" attitude does not hold sway in most markets.

So if you accept the parallel then it beautifully illustrates the absolute absurdity of this sense of entitlement. You don't get to hire a piano tuner then not pay them because you don't like the sound after the work is done. You don't get to ask for your money back after watching a movie and deciding you don't like it. You don't force people to commit time and resources into providing a service for you, then realize it's not what you wanted and not pay them. That's not how the real world works.

You watch one 30-second ad. 30 seconds. No money, no commitment. Just 30 measly seconds of your time. Then you get to watch ad-free video content absolutely for free. But even that is too much to ask for some people and it saddens me to see the value of the average streamer placed so low.",1601510454

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree that OP needs to find a way to deal with it and move on but I think you're seriously underestimating the effect shit like thus has on you.

Your high school years are *extremely* important for social development and confidence building.

OP had both of these destroyed by that girl.

Let me give an example of the type of effect this can have:

My little cousin is still young but he was shielded throughout his youth and had very little contact with other kids (also his parents aren't great at teaching him proper manners), because of this he doesn't know how to play properly. 

Once I playfully threw a pillow at him so he in turn picked up the closest thing (a wooden block) and threw it as hard as he could at me, he was 10. He wasn't doing it out of malevolence of anger, he was playing, it's just that in terms of social development he's well behind his peers.

What that means is that now he is (somewhat rightfully) excluded from by his peers because talking / playing with him is like playing with someone 3-4 years younger than themselves.

People who experience the level of bullying OP did in high school are socially delayed, they weren't able to develop the requisite social skills required to be a well functioning adult and now still aren't able to because the time for playing and high-school type friendships are over.

It's like being developmentally delayed.

It's not just coping with what happened that OP has to work on: he likely has to put a LOT of work into building his confidence and social skills up as well.",1601510455

Battery advocates need to remember that every single battery sold today will die one day and need replacement. Do you think many people are going to replace a dead Li-Ion battery pack ($10-18,000) in a 8 year old car?

"learnprogramming","t5_2r7yd","If your ""bootcamp grades depend on it"" first step is to use the materials and instructors and tutors from the bootcamp for the short term. Maybe get more professional resources like Pluralsight or even a highly rated Udemy or CourseRA course designed for people on a clock with a specific objective in mind.

Many people consider JavaScript on backend an abortion. You may even hate JavaScript. It doesn't really matter if you're bad at JavaScript on backend it doesn't even matter if you fail your bootcamp. What matters is you create a plan for yourself that you can build on. Maybe checkout the WikiHow on how to be a web developer to plan out a career instead of just taking tutorials and getting pissed off at them or learning what they teach at a bootcamp. The truth is most of the knowledge you will gain yourself. And no you don't do it memorizing syntax or how to ""link it together"" as you put it. If you truly want to know how to ""link it together"" you need more foundational knowledge like OSI Model and HTTP protocol and interprocess communication. A bootcamp or a tutorial is going to gloss over those topics (unless it's about those) so you have to learn yourself or find the knowledge.

And don't forget about ""real"" school. There will be a programming class you can take somewhere (not a bootcamp). You will learn that the syntax and APIs are unimportant. What's more important is you figure out how to solve problems.",1601510456

7 of cups is not a negative card.  It tells of being able to have a broad view of things.  You are not someone who is locked into a particular way of thinking or being.  You have a great deal of flexibility of mind and you can insert yourself into different situations and find a way to make yourself at home.

 Tower reversed means that when things fail, you let them go.  This is a strength as well.  Knowing when something is no longer worth the effort to shore it up, is a life skill and you have the ability to cut your losses when necessary.

7 of wands reversed is also not negative.  It's a negative-ish card, but reversed, which generally lessens the negativity.  It's saying that you are not a fighter by nature.  You are willing to fight for what you want, but you are more likely to take a peaceful approach instead.

&gt; To date 48 current and former Weta Digital workers have come forward to reporter Kristin Hall with concerns about the company&amp;#039;s culture.

&gt; In a statement to 1 NEWS on September 8, Weta Digital acknowledged there have been &amp;quot;Historical behaviour issues&amp;quot; at the company, including sharing of inappropriate content and commentary.

&gt; Porn use at Weta Digital is not the most serious allegation that&amp;#039;s been made against the company, but it&amp;#039;s said to be one of the first things some young women are told about when they start.

It is just as much a fault of the environment surrounding them as their own particular mindset. The youth has grown increasingly pessimistic, depressed and angered at the inability to change things.

Like imagine trying to instruct a new player into League. He asks what Spell Haste does, you tell him. He asks 'Yeah but how much exactly?' Are you really going to tell him in-depth why 10 Spell Haste is 11% CDR but 20 Spell haste is 17% CDR and not 22% like you would think and all that other shit?

Why not just go the easy way and tell him 'Oh yeah actually 10 Spell Haste makes your cooldowns go down 10% faster' and be done with it? And when you can do that, why not just rename the whole damn stat to cooldown speed instead and avoid this idiotic situation to begin with?

I can see why the mall manager would not want to get involved in what is, ultimately, a staff issue at a particular store.  The store manager should care, though.  People don’t just shop for themselves.  I’m trying to imagine some clerk telling me to not bother going into a men’s store (when I plan to purchase a gift for my spouse or dad) — that’s just dumb. 

I don’t know if you want advice (perhaps not). I offer this kindly, ignore if unwelcome:  too many overweight people or others with physical characteristics that make them stand out have to deal with this kind of rudeness and some have developed some strategies for coping.  Visible confidence (I.e. posture, eye contact) helps and faking it is an acceptable substitute if it doesn’t come naturally.  Some bullies don’t have the balls to mock people who look like they won’t be bothered.   I’ve also marveled at those who have some good comebacks at the ready and manage to turn the embarrassment back on to the person who tried to shame them.  I’m sure you can find some body-positive folks who deal with appearance-related harassment who can share great strategies and advice online.",1601510459

We use a marginal tax rate system, so only the money above $612k (assuming he and his wife file jointly) is taxed at the highest percent, which is 37%.

In case anyone is curious, here is an example of how it works:

Say your filing status is single and you earned $70,000. You would pay 10 percent on the first $9,700 of your earnings ($970); then 12 percent on the chunk of earnings from $9,701 to $39,475 ($3,573); and then 22 percent on the remaining income, up to $80,000 ($8,916).

Your total tax bill would be $13,459. Divide that by your earnings of $80,000 and you get an effective tax rate of 16.8 percent, which is lower than the 22 percent bracket you’re in.",1601510460

That was the whole point. 

Not sure how paying a livable wage has anything to do with paying taxes and supporting freeloaders either.

It's almost like you're pivoting to more bullshit because you're just some piece of shit troll who doesn't really have anything to back up your bullshit and finally got called out on it so you're getting your panties twisted up in a bunch and trying to act like you're somehow better when you're don't even understand the basics and can't defend a single point of stupid you made.

Also feels like a safe bet that someone who thinks the way you do doesn't actually donate a single fucking thing or help anyone because if you did you'd understand that providing the basics through shit like a livable wage (which is what is being argued for here) does a whole lot more to help people than supporting programs which are designed to help ease the burden of those needs on people without ever actually addressing the root of the problem. 

Troll isn't so much an insult as it is just pointing out how utterly useless anything you 'contribute' is because you started from a point of bullshit and simply ate the entire shit sandwich you've been served.

I don’t know your case specifically, but in hospital I work, a mid level assessed and sets the plan of care, then a doc read it over and co-sign.

But I was arguing about independent NP, 100% autonomy; Prescribe meds, assessment, set the plan of care, etc, without any tiny teeny single supervising. A pt can list a doc name in the lawsuits (because any one can sue anyone-else , for example, I even can sue you over this comment b/c abc), but the law in independent NP will remove the doc from his responsibilities. This is like suing 2 independent healthcare provider, rather than the doc’s taking responsible for the NP.",1601510461

Instead of saying “oh I’ll do this task in ten minutes,” it’s saying to yourself “I’ll work on this task for five minutes and then I will let myself have a rest.” More often then not, you get sucked into the task and don’t want to stop after the five minutes is up.

With my fingers and nether regions physically in a toilet bowl the whole time. I don’t think I’ve ever even heard of masturbating on the toilet (for women at least). You said you only saw her for a moment and then immediately left- I’m almost positive what you saw was her inserting/removing a tampon or menstrual cup, or checking for blood. 

Either way, it’s definitely an awkward situation, and I’m sure she feels just as horrified and embarrassed as you do, especially since she did forget to close the door (maybe because she needed to be able to hear the kids, or maybe just by mistake). I think you could either ignore the incident completely and continue to hire her as usual- without ever mentioning it again- and just let the situation fade into a bad, cringy memory (I think you should go with this option, she probably does not want to be reminded of it ever again in her life), or you could shoot her a message next time you need her along the lines of

 “Hey, I know last time you babysat for us, there was an awkward situation where I accidentally violated your privacy in the bathroom. Because the door was a bit cracked, I assumed that it was empty and a light had just been left on. I’m really sorry for unintentionally intruding on you, and I’m hoping that you are still comfortable babysitting for us in the future. You have great qualifications and are incredibly skilled at caring for my children, and I feel confident while I’m gone that they are in good capable hands.

"forhonor","t5_38p4n","&gt;It can only counter like two more heroes zone option select and the counter to dodge roll is unreliable and will never happen if they dodge roll directly after the light as a read (all she can do from second light is a heavy). There are also ways to counter light spam, if you play pk as light, light, heavy, you're gonna get easy to predict real fast, and her chain ends at that heavy AND that chain is extremely stamina intensive (three lights and a heavy, damage of the average characters two lights and a heavy, and her enhanced lights cost more stamina if blocked). You have options to counter roll, feint dodge forward heavy, as well as zone option select, feint full block.

The GB invulnerability state can happen mid roll after identifying an attack as a heavy. It doesn't always happen depending on how far away you are from one another and the heavy used but it definitely can happen. The light, light heavy chain does take a lot of stamina to consistently do but while Aramusha need to do plenty of feints, your chains will connect for the most part unless they can correctly predict which attack you'll do and from what side it'll come. It's not an easy guess though as you can also light heavy or just side heavy directly to get into her mixup.

&gt;Pks has far less range than aramushas, to a laughable degree. I assumed the damage of it was 16 because that is the side dodge attack damage, I never land the forward one, so I did not know for sure. Even then, there is nothing to make hers better than aramushas.

No, PK has more range than Aramusha's forward dodge heavy. Well, they're about the same in terms of damage, and both allow the user to start their chains, and one has better distance while the other has trade potential. They're about equal. 

&gt;I play both characters and don't ever have an issue with aramushas stamina, but I do with pk.

This may be an issue between our playstyles then because I don't struggle with managing PK's stamina but I do with Aramusha's even though he's my main.

&gt;Like I said, aramushas dodge forward heavy is also a chain starter, so if they don't parry, you get access to your chains.

On the off chance they don't zone option select all you're likely to get out of this is a side light. Everything else is reactable.",1601510464

Biologically it makes sense to keep them, and no, it's not less hygienic to have hairs, in case someone tells you that.

Personally it would bother me if they are really much and stick out under shirts or whatever, so I would trim that.   
Same goes for pubic hair, just a bit trimmed and groomed is fine with me, I don't like wild growing bushes up to the navel or thighs.

The eyes thing doesn't have any apparent physical/visual source as shown in my post.

I should have been clearer about that and I should give dude more slack. Because honestly that is what I am asking for. I'm not asking you to be a doormat. Im asking you to try to help your fellow person. Go educate yourself and find a few techniques that will help both you and someone with BPD get through a conversation or two. You'd be surprised how much power you have to help. 

I'm going to add on here that going through DBT, the only successful therapy for BPD, is TERRIFYING. You are literally trying to change things that go right down to the fabric of your being, and your body and head and soul all scream NO! Yet you still jump into the rabbit hole because you just can't keep living life the same way anymore. And then you have to trust them that it worked as they put another rabbit hole in front of you. Eventually the idea is that you won't be scared anymore and the holes won't exist. Simplisticly.

&gt; Sheikh Saaliq, The Associated Press Published Wednesday, September 30, 2020 6:20AM EDT. NEW DELHI - The gang rape and death of a woman from the lowest rung of India&amp;#039;s caste system sparked outrage across the country on Wednesday with several politicians and activists demanding justice and protesters rallying on the streets.

&gt; In December last year, a 23-year-old Dalit woman in the same state died after being set ablaze by a gang of men as she made her way to court to press rape charges.

&gt; In India, rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight since the 2012 gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus.

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","SAME. In fact, I prefer traveling when I have to wake up at 3 or 4 in the morning! Going to the airport in the evening, or even at night, just doesn't feel right. Though usually this results in me not getting much sleep since the night before I would be way too excited to let my brain rest. My friends always say ""oh god I have to wake up at like 3 AM"" but to me that's the best part! I don't know why, maybe it's the sense of adventure, or the novelty of it, since I NEVER wake up at 3-4AM. 

Plus, I love airports. A lot of people hate airports and I just don't understand. Maybe it's because the airport at my country is quite nice. I love seeing the planes go by, seeing the people and wondering where they're going to. I usually buy a lot of books in the airport since the bookstores at my country are shit. I could spend a whole day just chilling at the airport and not get bored.

You could try working for some boss or company for free for a Few months.

It shows u really want to work for them, and they can learn you the job for free while you're helping them out for free.

In my country this happens under a ""practical education at workplace"" statute and this is legal.

I have spent many many years doing nothing myself. Time flies by so fast.

Past 6 years I been doing some education and worked some jobs and time flies by while working as well. 

In 2017/2018 I didn't work, and now I've been working for 1.5 year (with a 2 month break for Corona lock down) and I already wish I could take a year off.

And i only work from 14.30 till 18.30five days a week, lmao. I'm almost 34 now and hope I can have some good years ahead, but you can't choose what life gives... Just have to make the best of what you've got.

It's more important to believe in yourself as being a worthwhile individual - worthy of loving who you are and where you are right now in life. 

Life's not about the destination or the things we should supposedly have experienced or should now be experiencing, 

It's about enjoying the trip wherever it leads, about loving ourselves and loving all other living beings.",1601510467

"proceduralgeneration","t5_2ssff","Brief excerpt from the start of this article:

&gt; Like some of my previous ZZT games, [Computer Dungeon Slash: ZZT] relies heavily on procedural generation, with apparently such complexity that Dr. Dos called it ""basically sorcery"" during their playthrough on Twitch...

&gt; So what about the workings of this game?

&gt; I'll start with ""sorcery""--there's something to that, for sure. When I work with procedural generation it feels a bit like alchemy. Scientific, but also a little bit mysterious and magical. I hope this article helps you better understand the scientific side of that coin.

&gt; For readers not intimately familiar with ZZT, one reason a veteran ZZTer would call my level generation ""sorcery"" is its limitations. ZZT is a 1991 DOS game-creation-system, after all, simple enough for 8-year-old me to use. So if you don't know anything about ZZT coming in, I hope this write-up helps you better understand the absurdity and appeal of working in it and pushing its limits.

&gt; Further, if you came into this wanting to know how this stuff works so that you can experiment with it or even improve on it, I want you to be empowered to do so.

Funnily enough, for a person that was advocating for fact checking, in the first 10 minutes he had to make a statement about drinking bleach, and deny a bunch of accusations that were correct.

The debates should be more orderily and less biased, and more importantly, if you actually want proper informational debates, your prerogative should be to kill any dispute, and that is where Wallace failed. Instead of saying ""Let him speak"", he should have said ""Not true, here is why"" TO BOTH CANDIDATES. That will always be more impactful than muting a microphone (and even if you do that's not stopping Trump from pulling a Reagan and doing something of the likes of ""I AM PAYING FOR THIS MICROPHONE"")",1601510468

Lo Celso and Ndombele don’t play together so what’s the point of mentioning that. 

Son is a bit injury prone but not massively Kane is very injury prone but is the back il gonna be anywhere near Kanes level? It’s all good well and good having a back up but losing Kane is still massive. 

Your defence has not been great I don’t know what you’re watching and it’s not a stupid hypothetical use your eyes not just the score like you conceded in every single game this season if you want to use that logic and you’ve conceded more than us with your great defence. 


These are all issues that are still there with your signings you wouldn’t be an amazing team with a back up striker and Skriniar IMO you’d be top 4 contenders but I don’t think you’re much much better than us or United.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

I’ve tried many supplements and dietary changes, some have definitely helped. I get my supplements mainly from Thorne and Life Extension but there are other reputable ones.  
  
Things that I *have* tried that I can recommend would be N-Acetyl l-Cysteine, apple cider vinegar, and MCT oil. Diet is very subjective of course, but for a lot of people, low FODMAP seems to help. For me personally, I got my life back eating strict Paleo low FODMAP.

"LearnerDriverUK","t5_2wwc8","I also thought that way too :)  But my instructor shaped my thinking a bit when it came to that. Because we wouldn't be frequently going on fast roads, the presence of traffic actually can help you to more easily moderate your speed. You often get the chance to stop completely and assess situations from a still point as well. You also get the chance to observe other road users, which might help you figure out any tricky roads. Change how you think about it if you can.

I was super anxious as a learner and all I can recommend is that you keep putting yourself in these situations whilst you have an instructor beside you. You're in a great position to learn how to handle them and I promise you - it WILL become easier.

Something that helped me was to write down all the things that worried or scared me when I was driving, and then my instructor basically helped me experience them all and learn how to cope with them. I still get nervous as a licensed driver, but because of that, I can slow down the anxiety and think practically.  


Kindness costs nothing! And there's plenty of experienced drivers and instructors on here who can help you out practically with the scary stuff :)",1601510470

In my personal experience, I started by finishing myself off into someone's mouth after a blowjob. The next step was sitting on a woman's chest and masturbating to completion. I'd still feel a bit weird just laying there next to (or in front of) someone and masturbating without touching them at all. But I think I could do it now, if that was what someone really wanted.

Baby steps.

I really like the one where I'm sitting on their chest because I get to see their face and boobs, I get to come on their neck or chest, and there's a lot of closeness a bit like actual sex. It also allows me to slide forwards and have them lick my balls, if they're willing to do that.",1601510471

Hi all! I'm new to Reddit and I'm new to repairing NDSL and after watching a lot of videos and getting the right tools and everything I did my very first hinge repair + re-shell last week. It went pretty well, but unfortunately I did make a slight tear in the top LCD screen's ribbon cable while I was putting it back together. OMG I hate that thing. Anyway, 2 days later my bf soldered off the speakers to it and he put it on a new screen and I put it back together... but then my bottom screen became pink. ;\_; I tried 3 different screens, they were all pink so I believe it's a motherboard issue. My bff fixed one of my other motherboards that had an issue, so I'm hoping to pick that one up later and try it and see if I can get this one to work.

So anyway, I just wanted to share my first repair/reshell, but unfortunately I was just really unlucky and had one problem after another. ;\_; Other than the pink bottom screen, I think I did okay. And I think it looks nice overall. The old DS was a white one with a broken hinge, I used the buttons with the transparent blue case and I think it looks pretty good together. \^\^ Thanks for reading/looking at my photos.

\-Jen

Edit: It's fixed, with the new motherboard. Sure enough, a new motherboard fixed that pinkish screen. I normally like pink, but that really sucked. T\_T

"CardinalsPolitics","t5_3hfre","&gt; imaginary white supremacist boogeyman while ignoring the elephant in the room

Imaginary? You mean the [widely](https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-report-white-supremacist-murders-more-than-doubled-in-2017) agreed [upon](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carlieporterfield/2020/06/25/white-supremacist-terrorism-on-the-rise-and-spreading/) greatest [source](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/09/04/white-supremacists-terror-threat-dhs-409236) of [domestic](https://www.csis.org/analysis/escalating-terrorism-problem-united-states) terrorism/[violence](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-23/white-supremacists-top-terrorist-threats-within-u-s-wolf-says)? Or should I just trust the guy who knows more about Oregon crime data than the Oregon FBI and vomits right wing buzzwords? Tough call.

Anyway, what the moderator asked: 

&gt; You have repeatedly criticized the vice president for not specifically calling out Antifa and other left wing extremist groups. But are you willing tonight to condemn white supremacists and militia group and to say that they need to stand down and not add to the violence in a number of these cities as we saw in Kenosha and as we’ve seen in Portland.

When given a specific group name that he asked for (because he couldn’t just say “white supremacy is bad” for lord knows what reason), he says “Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.” That is not a denunciation, it’s a call to action. 

In term of Biden, he said last night and has said before: “And by the way, violence in response is never appropriate, never appropriate. Peaceful protest is, violence is never appropriate.”

So yeah I think the group that is killing more people and has been killing more people is the bigger concern. I don’t care you if you want to call them a bunch of rednecks, they’re unfortunately dangerous and the president has spent years emboldening them and it’s despicable. I’m curious if you’ve ever actually seen a BLM protest or if you’re really just getting all your information from the “media cartel” because you honestly sound like a caricature of a clueless right winger who mainlines fox and I can’t tell if it’s a joke (I mean I’ve seen your comments for years so I’m pretty sure it’s not unless you’re very dedicated and very bored). 

The reason we can’t have a good faith discussion about antifa is because of you. It’s a disorganized, decentralized, mostly imaginary group that gets blamed for any disorder that’s really due to decades (well, centuries) is systemic racism, oppression, and violence. When you want to value human lives over property and read a real news source, maybe we can have that good faith discussion you crave.",1601510472

"badwomensanatomy","t5_2zlzd","I disagree with your interpretation. It’s arguing against the fetishization of virgins. It’s mostly referring to female virgins since women’s virginity is more romanticized than men’s, but the phrase applies to men as well. Who wants to marry a male virgin? Not many people I believe.

I understand people have different values, and as long as there are no idiotic double standards about gender I will shut up and let them live how they want. But logically speaking, deciding to spend the rest of your life with someone you’ve never slept with, especially if you’re still so sexually inexperienced, is probably not the best idea.

So I don’t think that phrase is implying that anyone of any gender is worthless if they have no sexual experience, just that people shouldn’t look for virgins exclusively because of the often sexist myths they’ve been taught. The logic that makes virgin women desirable is usually pretty gross and based on myths.",1601510474

"Terraria","t5_2sg5b","I agree that isn't fun for two reasons:

1. Time for upgrade

When you enter Hardmode, you need to prevent the spread fast since it will dominate all areas easily, the only **decent** way of doing this is to get the Clentaminator from the Steampunker.

To get her you need to defeat The Destroyer and to do that you need good equipment, but is going to take a while to do that, giving time to the biomes to spread.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Unpredictability

If you're like me, you probably planned a elaborated plan to prevent the biomes from spreading (Ex: i'm digging a hellevator here because acording to TEdit \[cheating\] this is where the Corruption part of the 'V' spread formation is going to appear) but it doesn't work since it can spawn Hallow and having a chance of passing through your Hellevator and ruining your plan (Ex: Spanning more next to spawn). The only way of having any knowledge about where is going to spawn is using TEdit.

And again, Time has a involvement here since you need to mine new tunnels fast before it reaches the area but you can't since you're a paper and your weapons are made of cardboard.

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, there are ways to prevent the spread problem to happen, such as:

1. Build NPC houses far from your First Spawn point
2. Make your world an anthill
3. Fishing after starting Hardmode

but still, is really frustating and for me, the only way to enjoy hardmode is cheating, which is a huge dissapointment.",1601510474

"plantclinic","t5_38zax","I’ve had this elephant ear for about a year and about a month ago it started to get brown spots. It had a spider mite infestation and I’ve been spraying it down weekly which I think was my mistake. It’s been crazy hot accompanied with bad air quality which means my apartment has limited airflow and no air conditioning as well. After I thought I controlled the spider mites, I saw mealy bugs which prompted me to keep doing weekly sprays but I think it was actually blight instead (I kept seeing white fluffs)? I have no idea, I’m just sad that my plant has gotten to this point and I kept encouraging the growth by weekly spraying. I’ve also now noticed my rubber plant that was next to it form these white hard patches underneath the leaves along with brown spots. Is this something that’s treatable once it has it or will it be a goner?",1601510475

It’ll be a week tomorrow, and still no difference.

"HorrorMovies","t5_2r9m7","Just bullet-points more than anything else, otherwise, this would be a very long essay on creative writing, psychology, biology, filmmaking, and more. At least this should get you started and then any other questions/comments you have, I can answer them and try help more. 

I am currently working on my own horror stories -- novels/short stories, not screenplays.  


**Scary:**  
\- Jump scares  
\- Creepiness  
\- Themes and narratives  
\- Atmosphere/mood, music, darkness, and lighting  
\- Timing, pacing, tension, and suspense  


**Iconic:**  
\- Icons and images  
\- Uniqueness (memorable)  
\- Style, lighting, and colour palette  
\- Meta-narrative    
\- Drama, conflict, and dialogue    


Of course, maybe you want scary and iconic, such as the art horror classic from Kubrick, based on Stephen King's novel by the same name, The Shining. 

Some examples, for a number of reasons and within a number of categories, all of which I suggest you study (staying purely within horror/terror here, though I would highly suggest the chillers and thrillers, along with classic thriller and classic horror):  
SAW 1  
SAW 2  
The House of Wax (remake)  
Thirteen Ghosts  
Cube 1  
Halloween 1  
A Nightmare on Elm Street 1  
IT (1990)  
When a Stranger Calls (remake)  
The Ring  
Hellrasier 1  
Jeepers Creepers 1  
Jeepers Creepers 2  
Creep  
Sinister  
The Woman in Black  
Dead Silence  
The Boy 1  
The Fly (remake)  
Silent Hill  
The Cabin in the Woods  
1408  
Event Horizon  
Poltergeist  


P.S. It's also extremely useful to know what not to do and what doesn't work -- and why -- and for that you can simply watch bad horror films or horror films that failed, such as Jeepers Creepers 3.",1601510475

There are definitley a lot of MOTW eps in season 2 after that, but the main storyline keeps showing up a lot more often after those episodes at the end of season 1.

&gt; Hyundai Motor said Monday it had exported four fuel cell electric vehicles to Saudi Arabia, its first-ever FCEV exports to the Middle East.

&gt; &amp;quot;Exporting FCEVs to the world&amp;#039;s top oil producer Saudi Arabia is a meaningful step and we will make efforts to expand the supply of FCEVs in the Middle East,&amp;quot; said Hyundai Motor Vice President of the Middle East and African region Jeong Bang-sun.

&gt; Hyundai Motor and Saudi Aramco signed a memorandum of understanding in June last year to roll out more FCEVs in Saudi Arabia.

The fact remains, Labour has lost seats to a different left-wing party. That is called a split vote, regardless of the maths. Labour now have fewer staunchly left-wing areas to call “safe seats”, and have to fight for more of the swing vote, often in locations which have been successfully gerrymandered by the Tories.",1601510478

It's not a guarantee, but it does happen.  But the humping (and the potential issues with neutered dogs really disliking intact dogs) is really the only behavior I've personally seen that changes dramatically like that.",1601510479

Difference between us is I'm admitting my delusion, but I think EU has not looked nearly as strong as they claimed to be. G2 looked weak for most of the split, and the quality of their games weren't that great. I don't think TL and G2 are the same teams from 2019 (even though G2 have the same roster), and the meta actually favors the NA teams this year.

As for group C, Fnatic looked weak. They usually bring it up for worlds, but I really do think EU is going to get their asses handed to them this year. TSM looked good in NA, supposedly doing well in scrims (?), and the meta suits this team very well too.

I feel bad for FLY, they could try contend for 2nd seed if they're lucky, but Chovy is too insane and Wildturtle vs Deft is not a matchup I see going very well. Perhaps Ignar/PoE can make some magic happen, and Santorin has been good too.",1601510479

* Bombs over Brooklyn = BoB, Dead Skin Mask = DSM, Madrigal = Mad, Veridis Quo = VQ

* Rob is not immune to BOB’s heat, neither is Medea

* Arthur will have a max of 4 minions at once to keep a consistent A POW for the duration of section 2 excluding the use of the smoke grenades

* Arthur’s swordsmanship skills include reflexes, footwork, and anything else that’d be relevant to swordplay.

* Guy benefits from VQ’s precision when it comes to senses and aiming. This means he’s pinpoint accurate with projectiles.
 
* Guy can produce 1000g of material in a minute which is about 16.66 grams per second.

# Section 1: [Preparing to Advance](https://bit.ly/3jaUwjn)

*Arthur wasn’t the most enthused about the fight he was about to participate in but one thing in particular had caught his attention. That fellow on the opposing team matched Isley’s description of the man who had beaten him months ago. This was not something Arthur could simply let slide,* “Come Mota! Together we shall claim vengeance for Isley!” 

*Guy looked over at Arthur surprised by how seriously he was taking this,* “Sure thing, tough guy. I don’t really have anything better to do today.”

As the match begins Guy will graft an ear and a mouth to Arthur so that the pair may remain in contact without yelling to each other, and Guy will remove his brain from his skull, shielding it in bone and rolling it away. This way, even if his whole body is destroyed, Guy will survive. He will also remove his spleen, an unnecessary organ, and give it to Arthur for later use. At the same time Arthur will knight Masu (済) to give him an A POW blade. Guy will then shed his skin and a relatively thin layer of muscle and hand it over to Arthur. Guy will then also shed around 800g of muscle mass from throughout his body to create two eye drones, composed of an eye sitting atop a hand which will survey under the stage to provide real time info of the enemies if they decide to hide under the stage. 

From the tier 3 spawner in front of them Arthur will knight a trampoline and order it to follow Guy to the southwest pillar. Arthur will then climb onto the first platform and knight the crystal ball waiting at the 6:00 position, Arthur will briefly glance at it to check if the enemies are visible or have already gotten to hiding someplace unseen like under the stage. If so, Arthur will tell Guy who will shoot a flare underneath the stage for improved visibility for the drones. After this Arthur will give it the same order to follow Guy. Guy, meanwhile, has grabbed a steel chair and A POW bounced off the trampoline to the top of the southwest pillar where he finds some smoke grenades. He’ll throw these to Arthur, who is knighting a mannequin at the 7:30 tier 2 spawner. Once the crystal ball is at the top of the pillar with Guy will make a flesh stand to hold the ball with an eye staring into it. This will give Guy, and by extension Arthur, a constant birds eye view of the arena. At this point Madrigal will release control over the crystal ball.

Arthur will jump onto the knighted mannequin, which will piggyback-carry him to the 9:00 tier 2 spawner and grab a net launcher, Arthur knighting the net. While riding, Arthur will carve a [memento](bit.ly/PinkGOD) of SR’s greatest benefactor into Lancelot’s back as a reminder that they fight for more than just pride. Guy and Arthur himself will now both be moving east while the mannequin, now named Lancelot, will use the net gun to provide cover fire in case UE attempts to approach early. If the net does land Arthur can command it to constrict with A POW which will keep either Rob or Medea busy for a decent length of time if not outright suffocating them. Guy will jump down from the pillar, using the trampoline to break his fall and it will follow him over to the southeast pillar where he will jump up again and collect the tar gun. After this Guy will jump back down and collect a second steel chair from the bottom of the pillar. 

Simultaneously Arthur has gone to the 4:30 and 3:00 positions to collect two more mannequins. One he has knighted and named Percival and the other has been covered in the Guy’s shed skin which he can now move around like a second body, which has been named Mordred. With all the necessary parts collected Guy will meet Arthur in the centre of the arena. If this location has been claimed by UE then they will settle for the eastern portion of the lower platform. On reuniting with Arthur, Guy will create straps made of his hair to turn the steel chairs into makeshift shields. By this point Guy will have regenerated a decent amount of his muscle mass and skin.

Summary of items collected in this section: 

* Two shields made of steel folding chairs and hair

* A crystal ball which can convey real time position of the enemies directly to Guy and Arthur

* Three mannequins, two controlled by Mad, and one controlled by VQ

* A net gun

* A tar gun

* Smoke bombs

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I've said it before but I'll repeat myself. I get sexually attracted mostly to people I know well and it usually means that I get attracted to my friends of both genders. Not to all of them, but to ones who I'm totally comfortable with, who smell great and I like them touching me. 

When my husband and I started dating, we'd already had a few talks here and there, so at first I was just curious, shy and nervous and it kind of made me horny, but when we got to know each other better, I got far hornier, that horny that I initiated our sex. And no, he was never ignoring me, dreading etc. None of TRP shit. He's interesting to talk with, he makes me laugh, he's really generous with compliments, I feel that I'm safe and secure with him, as he never made me feel unwanted or unloved. I was able to initiate because I was sure that he loves me for me and not just for the opportunity to have sex.

Plug your cassette deck into your amplifier in the proper channel.  Plug your speakers to your amp. 

When you got your tape deck operating and playing back into your amp and out of your speakers you can start recording. 

Plug your phone via AUX IN to your tape deck. It will either be 3.5mm to 3.5mm or 3.5mm to RCA. The latter is more common. Once all those connections are made , press Record+Play on your deck with a blank cassette loaded and then press play on your phone. Check your meters to keep a good recording level.

Political commentator Dana Perino, speaking next asserted that “If you were a Democrat that was concerned about Biden maybe falling flat tonight, you don’t have to worry about that going forward.”

It's super easy and you learned how to do the first part in Kindergarten:  Go make friends with people. That's it. Go make friends, be a good friend, make them offers on thinks you actually believe in. That's it. That's the whole secret of my success. Make friends, tell them about things you believe in, and push them to better their own lives and the lives of everyone around them. No buzzwords, no games, no techniques, no bullshit.

A separate but distinct species, *Storeria victa* occupies peninsular Florida. It has two fewer midbody scales (15) than *Storeria dekayi* and is more likely to have yellow collar markings on the neck.

*Storeria* brown and redbelly snakes are not considered medically significant to humans in terms of venom and are usually reluctant to bite, but all animals with a mouth can use it in self-defense.

In your case, if the shadow character was an AI run by the game, then I would probably consider it semi co-op. But as it stands, it's just an asymmetrical competitive game where three of the players have an incentive to collaborate against the fourth.",1601510483

Hey there, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account does not yet meet our minimum karma requirements to post links. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply because we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). Next, read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn how the sub operates. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment but not submit music to listentothis. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely. New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. We can't divulge this score, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you are planning to submit your own music or the music of someone with whom you have a personal association** (e.g. friend, neighbor, colleague, etc.), you may do so [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week) after your account is at least one day old. Additionally, we recommend reading the [guidelines for self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as violating these rules can result in a site-wide shadowban - that's simply the way reddit operates and is outside of our control. 

**If you wish to advertise your music in listentothis**, you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* without the need to earn upvotes. 

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician**, listentothis is not the place for your first musical creations. This sub is for *finished* tracks, and even then, you may post [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week). There are plenty of other music communities that will give you feedback and advice on how to improve your sound. Some of the most well-known communities are listed below.

* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback

How is it reasonable to close off to SA or Tas or QLD until Victoria is completely under control?

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","As far as I'm aware, the clutch claw enrage counter gets reset once the monster enrages, so the final scenario could never happen. That said, the first example is how it works, if you clutch and do 1 swipe each 3 times, you still enrage the monster.

IIRC, one claw swipe to the head is worth 1/3rd of the clutch claw enrage, while one flinch shot (even if it misses a wall) is worth 1/2 of the clutch claw enrage. You also get one mercy action after triggering the enrage, provided you are fast enough, so after the 3rd turn, you can still flinch shot or turn a 4th time.

Since TA runs don't use flinch shots, you'll often see 3 turns + clutch claw attack as an opener, since it tenderizes the monster and enrages it, so Agitator activates.",1601510485

*****
&gt; During the last several weeks, we&amp;#039;ve confronted the unsettling familiarity of the present circumstance: the same virulent nationalism, Pan-Turkism and anti-Armenian sentiment that spurred the Genocide not long ago are all back to haunt us today, bubbling up into escalating violence against Armenians and threats upon Armenia&amp;#039;s sovereignty.

&gt; As descendants of genocide survivors across the Diaspora, our generation is responsible for carrying forward the cause of genocide recognition for our grandparents who no longer could.

&gt; It&amp;#039;s becoming increasingly clear every day that Armenia and its people face an existential threat imposed by Azerbaijan and Turkey in circumstances eerily similar to those that prefaced the Armenian Genocide.

Literally the point of a stack is a reception or receiving TD, in the same play, get you points for both the QB and the receiver.

A reception for Hill is one that doesn’t go to Kelce.  A TD is even worse because the ball goes to the other team.  There is small consideration for a non TD reception increasing the odds of both getting a TD, but it’s overshadowed by the fact that only one of them can get that TD.

A stack has higher highs and lower lows compared to an an uncorrelated pairing of equal expected value. So you try to do it only on great offenses.  But not two receivers.  

Hill and Kelce, for example just have lower lows compared to an uncorrelated paring of equal EV.",1601510486

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

1. Fever
2. Exhaustion
3. Body sores (mostly from what he thought was a fever)

He compared it to the ""Keto Flu"" when he was originally starting on Keto.

But since, he said he smelt this aroma throughout the sickness and since getting better, he will catch a whiff of it every now and then. He says it's almost like a B.O. smell (showers regularly) but not exactly that bad. And my sister's mother-in-law (who was tested and diagnosed with Covid) 100% agrees that she experiences the same smell.

My dad will shower with the smell on him and says he can still smell it after. My sister has claimed to smell it too.

Edit: One other symptom they shared was a loss of hair. It just comes out when they wash in the shower. They still have most of their hair, but they have said it's fallen off more than normal in the shower.

CC *live* was mostly accurate.  There were mistakes here and there, but it was being typed live, in real time.  It doesn’t take days and days to listen to a speech and write down what was said verbatim.

Sorry, but it just doesn’t.  Do you have to listen to voicemails over and over, throughout several days, to get the gist of the message?

Im sure once several days have passed, and the transcripts still say the same thing, you will say the transcribers lied because they were radical leftists, right?  And you’ll watch the video yourself, and *hear* it for yourself, over and over again, and say “fake news”, right?

The race for 5G
EU falls behind by 5G in global race Huawei's announced de facto exclusion threatens to reinforce this.
BERLIN/BEIJING(Own report) - Germany and the EU are falling behind in the global race to expand 5G networks and risk further losses if Huawei is excluded. As statements from the EU Commission and a short analysis from corporate circles show, the Union is not only missing its own targets on 5G; it is also losing touch with competing states. Until recently, eight 5G base stations per million inhabitants have been installed in the EU, 63 in the US, 86 in China and almost 1,500 in South Korea. The Corona crisis threatens to lead to further setbacks. This also applies to the de facto exclusion of the Chinese group Huawei from the construction of the German 5G networks, on which the German government has reportedly agreed. Companies that manufacture 5G components should be asked to demonstrate their ""trustworthiness""; the assessment should be based on intelligence. Huawei's exclusion could easily delay 5G construction by 18 months. The result: a backlog of 5G applications and billions in losses.

Time wasted
The European Commission has recently openly admitted that it has fallen behind its own plans to build the 5G networks. The Commission originally announced in September 2016 that ""at least one major city"" would have 5G in all Member States ""by the end of 2020 at the latest""; ""By 2025,"" ""all urban areas and major transport routes would have to have complete 5G coverage."" [1] In addition, the 5G structure must be 'coordinated' in order to avoid disruptions within the Union. The fulfilment of the plans is not in sight. On 18 September, Margrethe Vestager, Vice-President for Digital Affairs, and Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton unequivocally acknowledged that the Covid 19 pandemic had significantly set the EU back on 5G; Breton spoke of a backlog of ""four months"". Moreover, it was said, a fragmented 5G network was threatened. EU states should now make every effort to ""make progress as quickly as possible,"" demanded Breton, former head of the French IT company Atos. [2]

Behind
A brief analysis recently published by the European Round Table for Industry (ERT) shows that the EU has fallen behind not only its plans in terms of 5G, but above all in comparison to global competition. ErT, a lobbying group, is made up of more than 50 of Europe's largest corporations - from Germany, such as Siemens, Daimler, BASF and Deutsche Telekom. As the short analysis states, the first commercial 5G services in the USA were put into operation in April 2019; first EU countries followed with a three-month delay, and to date only 13 of the 27 EU countries have taken the first steps in commercial 5G. While eight 5G base stations per million inhabitants have been installed in the EU, the US has 63, China has 86, South Korea has 1,491 base stations per million inhabitants; the US has 7 percent, South Korea an unprecedented 98 percent, but the EU has upgraded only 1 percent of its 4G base stations to 5G base stations. The transition to 5G is also slowed down by the fact that the EU is already lagging behind the competition at 4G, the analysis states; only 70 percent of all users across the EU have switched from 3G to 4G to date, but in China, the US and South Korea they have already switched by around 90 percent. [3] The latter favours the switch to 5G.

World market leader China
The backlog of Germany and the EU is illustrated by information on the state of the 5G construction in China. More than 500,000 5G base stations are now installed there; By the end of 2020, the rate is expected to be 600,000. By way of comparison, in the Federal Republic of Germany, the market leader Deutsche Telekom is aiming to install 40,000 5G antennas during the same period. More than 46,000 5G base stations are located in Shenzhen, the southern Chinese metropolis where Huawei has its headquarters. Shenzhen is China's first city where 5G can be fully used. [4] By the end of August, more than 100 million 5G terminals were already used in China by more than 60 million users; The number of 5G-enabled smartphones to be delivered in China in 2020 is estimated to be 140 million. [5] This represents 72 percent of global revenue generated by the sale of 5G-enabled smartphones. According to forecasts, 28 percent of all mobile connections in the People's Republic are expected to be 5G in five years; that would be one third of all 5G connections worldwide. The 5G networks are now operating autonomous road and rail vehicles in some places in China, moving autonomous construction site equipment and carrying out operations using telemedicine. The leap towards comprehensive applications in everyday life and industry has long since begun.

The Secret Service decides
Germany is likely to increase its backlog - because, as reports confirmed yesterday, the German government has agreed on a de facto exclusion of the Chinese group Huawei from the construction of the German 5G networks. This means that the approval of the 5G components will require not only technical certification in the future, but also a review of the ""trustworthiness"" of the manufacturers. [6] The latter is to be carried out on the basis of intelligence, it is further said. This effectively gives the BND the final say in the decision on Huawei. The foreign intelligence service has said several times that it opposes the use of Huawei technology for Germany's 5G networks. The industry is now not only expected to incur additional billions in costs, but also with a considerable delay; More optimistic forecasts assume an 18-month loss of time resulting from the need to remove existing Huawei 4G components in addition to the 5G setup and expected delivery delays at 5G manufacturers Nokia and Ericsson. [7]

Milliardeneinbußen
Die Verzögerungen wiegen schwer: Der technologische Vorsprung, den China erzielt hat, wird sich mutmaßlich in einem Vorsprung auch bei den 5G-Anwendungen niederschlagen; die daraus resultierenden Profite drohen deutschen Unternehmen, sofern sie nicht in der Volksrepublik produzieren, verlorenzugehen. Um welche Größenordnung es sich handelt, lässt eine Untersuchung erahnen, die kürzlich die Londoner Firma Assembly Research veröffentlicht hat. Sie schätzt die Verluste ab, mit denen das Vereinigte Königreich aufgrund seines Huawei-Ausschlusses zu rechnen hat. Die Untersuchung geht davon aus, dass Großbritannien mit 5G und 5G-Anwendungen allein von 2020 bis 2030 wirtschaftliche Zuwächse von 173 Milliarden Pfund erzielen könnte - dann jedenfalls, wenn der neue Mobilfunkstandard schnell und effizient eingeführt wird. Sei dies nicht der Fall, heißt es, dann sei demgegenüber mit Einbußen zu rechnen. Laut Assembly Research muss von Einbußen in Höhe von 18,2 Milliarden Pfund ausgegangen werden. Die Untersuchung wurde von Huawei finanziert, basiert aber auf Zahlenangaben der britischen Regierung.[8] Auch wenn sie nicht im Detail auf Deutschland übertragen werden kann: Vergrößert sich der Rückstand vor allem gegenüber China, den etwa der ERT schon heute beklagt, stehen auch der Bundesrepublik satte Einbußen bevor.

So many young women/teenage girls are bogged down by life, societal expectations, love, and it’s just like, let them enjoy their youth. Even if your type of fun isn’t really getting drunk or partying, there’s definitely a kind of joy you hear when you listen to these kinds of songs that just make you forget your troubles even if just for a moment.

"IBO","t5_2s05l","Sounds fine! Whatever you think is best, I'm sure your mentors wants your essay to have proper arguments. This RQ sounds good too, you'd just have to find around 4 different arguments for why criticisms were related to her gender and ethnicity. Based on what I'm seeing, you have three sections, probably best to find one more so you can make the word count. Are you aiming for that 3500 words range or so? Then you probably need 4 sections. To get around 3500 words with introduction, 4 sections, and analysis would be about 12 pages double-spaced in total, just an estimate.

The one thing I'm confused about is are you focusing on the criticisms or positives? Your RQ mentions criticisms of Marie Antoinette, but you have a positive listed. Is that an actual section or would you put that in analysis? Personally, my whole essay is one side explaining positives with another perspective at the analysis, but I would ask your mentor if having a paragraph solely talking about positives would be okay, especially since your RQ is about exploring criticisms. 

Your arguments sound good, don't worry! For your RQ, it depends on what you feel would be easier to write. If I had to pick one that I would write the best with, I would pick the original, but at the same time I don't have any knowledge about the topic. I think this RQ you have is well-developed.

&amp;#x200B;

I just realized that my essay is completely different than Zenalyn's outline T\_T. Time for me to panic ask if the way I wrote half of my essay so far is okay...

I've been writing my essay as to what extent was X the main cause of Y, so each body paragraph was a different 'part' of X and how they influenced Y. I never knew you could  mention X as only one part of your essay and have other non-related events as other paragraphs.  I'm not sure which method would be better in IB, I would ask your mentor how you should formulate your body paragraphs.

Zenalyn's outline seems really good, I would definitely follow that if it works with your RQ.",1601510490

"forensics","t5_2qim5","I was polygraphed at each of my agencies I've worked at. It's very thorough, and there's a whole section about drug use along with other things. Don't lie. At all. Your word and integrity is *EVERYTHING* in this field. 

Most departments have some sort of regulation about it. Some are no MJ in the last 3/5 years, and some have a limit on the number of times used, but the time frame varies. Most places I've seen are a hard NO on ""hard drugs"". 

Now with that all being said, I personally know people at my same unit that have experimented with MJ prior to being hired. During the polygraph, they were honest, and it was outside of the threshold. But, it's harder overall to be hired IMO if you do have substance use history to overcome. 

Imagine being a hiring manager and having two fairly similar candidates, but one has substance use in the past, and one doesn't.

"Sacramento","t5_2qi09","I noticed you said you have netgear.  Ive honestly always had problems with comcast and netgear it seems they dont work well with each other.  Ive rented the modem from comcast and i dont have any problems.  Other things to consider;

Where is the router positioned relative the the devices?  My roommates decided it would be a good idea to put it in the garage when we first moved in.  It was far from centralized and there's a 3/4"" drywall firewall between the garage and rest of the house.  Bad connection, had a tech come out and install the router in a new location which is the room where my computer is and the connection is fantastic.

There's a frequency switch on the back of routers which I'm sure you've heard of and probably tried already but you can broadcast the signal on different frequencies which might help with your communication issues.  (If the problem actually is on your end).

The problem might be something with their lines or equipment thats not on your property or not readily visible.  I would find the line myself and visually inspect it if you can.

Could be compatability issues with modem/router/network card.  Could be issues with malicious software that installed itself on your router.  Access the router settings and verify that every device listed is one you own or otherwise recognize.

Explain that you've taken all these measures and want to have the issue resolved or you'll take your business elsewhere.  They are obligated to provide you consistant service for your money and I know they can be a pain to deal with so consider other isp options if they're available in your area.",1601510492

"financialindependence","t5_2t34z","Indie film. I won't get into detail here since I could write a book on the topic, but the confluence of cheap, high quality cameras which accept still camera optics and the advent of streaming video (at scale) combined to basically destroy the indie film business. Add macro demographic and economic changes to the mix and 2007-2009 basically saw the complete collapse of the industry as we knew it.

Indie filmmaker went from being a job that you could both do fulfilling work AND expect to grind out a decent but modest living (at least, if not better than) to....well if it gives you an idea, Indiewire (a trade magazine for indie film) interviewed 30 top filmmakers **who had regularly gotten their films into top festivals and are considered successful** and 28 of them had full-time jobs other than being a filmmaker.

Even though I was only in my early 20s when it all started I realized what was happening, gave up on the filmmaker route and worked on the business side of distribution, helping filmmakers, producers, distributors, financiers and even distribution platforms transition to the new realities of the industry. And, well, now I'm 35 and fully FI. 

Finances aside, almost everything else about being a filmmaker got worse in the past decade -- it's harder to get financing for your projects, harder to get people to notice your film given 20x the number of films are being distributed in 2020 than in 2010, young people don't watch many movies - let alone indie movies, indie theaters are dying, film festivals cater to big movies (and even premium TV!) more than every before, the industry has become *highly* politicized for creatives, etc. - I could go on. I know exactly one filmmaker (out of my network of hundreds I've worked with) who I suspect is happy with his career and that's only because he broke out of indies to studio films and won an Oscar.

"VoiceActing","t5_2r878","I understand the logic here, but object to the conclusion.

Going from finished text to audiobook release is not a simple hop, skip, and jump. I understand that for your friend this is simply a passion project, but when your passion project starts to call upon skills or equipment you lack, it's frankly kinda... wrong to dangle ""building your resume"" as compensation for the work you're asking others for. ""Passion project"" status does not transfer to the motive of everyone involved in the project, particularly if you're asking around for talent in a forum whose rule 1 is ""No Free Requests"".

I'm not saying that there are no scenarios where other people contribute without expectation of monetary compensation, but what you have briefly described here does not fit my personal guidelines for ""acceptable free work"", and I doubt I'm alone.

I don't mean to sound snooty about this; it does not seem to me that a simple ""no free requests"" fits this post, because I totally get where your friend is coming from. However, even if it's not predatory (and many calls for ""free"" work are), what is being asked for is not fair. The closest analogy I can think of is that you can't typically walk into a store and ask for a free laptop on which you will write your passion project novels that will be released for free, so you can't walk into a place where people are looking to make money on their skills and ask for pro bono help to turn them into audiobooks.",1601510492

I'm a bit confused about where home is and what Vermont represents? She's going to Vermont but it's not home but she's glad to be rid of her home?  Couldn't quite make sense of that, but I might be missing something obvious.

There are a few sentence / grammar opportunities, but as I said, you had me hooked right away.  Why did Maggie die?  What's going on in Vermont?  How come she was out of sorts?  Why doesn't narrator see her much anymore?  Good stuff :)

Try planning / outlining a bit more, because I think you've got talent and if you can master some of the logistics that are stymieing you at present, you could be very successful.  There are plenty of resources online and in books about how to structurally arrange your story, arrange scenes, build character arcs etc. Take advantage of them, study it a bit, then get back to work.

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","Interesting materialist take. Not sure why you're getting downvoted. The decline in the socialist character of the USSR almost immediately after its establishment seems inevitable if we assume the validity of the argument you presented, that scarcity = bureaucracy = some people have power over the masses = the creation of a new minoritarian class wielding power and oppressing the majoritarian class. Socialism in any case was supposed to arise out of post-scarcity no? So trying to build socialism in a semi-feudal society seems flawed from the outset. I've really been enjoying learning about Lenin but I kind of feel like his belief in the success of a proletarian revolution in Russia (and correct me if I'm wrong) was fully vested on the assumption that the Russian revolution will lead to a global revolution, including in places which had already achieved post-scarcity. Once this happened it would have enabled the world to genuinely embrace the socialist mode of production. But when this did plan not come to fruition and the revolutionaries instead adopted the socialism in one country concept it seems to me the effort was doomed. It's one thing to develop your productive forces for some time to then spread the revolution by force, and another to commit to building socialism in one country thus implicitly (or explicitly? Idk the details) abandoning the global revolution completely. In that sense the states that grew out of communist efforts like the USSR and China may be seen in a way as proto-socialist states. Like how medieval Venice and Genoa can be seen as proto-capitalist states (that arose out of their respective material conditions in feudal Europe but do not really resemble modern capitalist states). But just as these proto-capitalist states were capitalist experiments that did not exactly embody the capitalistic mode of production, but eventually the capitalist revolution did occur and did take over the world, so may these proto-Socialist states that do not exactly embody the socialist mode of production eventually see themselves succeeded by an actual global socialist revolution.",1601510493

This was before the pandemic went into full swing and testing wasn't available nor were there any ""confirmed cases,"" yet. In California I attended a wrap up party for a netflix show that I got invited to last minute. Over 300 people I wanna say.

So its your pick where I got it from.

Although I was never tested, I'm pretty sure I had it. I had a high fever, cough, body aches, chills, and sweats. Breathing was hard. I had blood and puss on my tonsils, thinking I had strep, I went to get tested for that. Negative. Bronchitis? Negative. They didn't know what was going on with me but gave me antibiotics so strong I got a bad yeast infection along with a massive coldsore flair up. I was in bed for almost 10 days and couldn't move. My brother got it, as well as my dad. I was so dehydrated but we thought it was just a normal flu. But I've had the flu, strep, mono, and Bronchitis before. This was definitely the worst I've gone through but never needed to get hospitalized.

After hearing all the symptoms and hearing from people who tested positive from my county, one thing we all had in common was the taste of blood and puss in the back of our throats. 

By the time I felt like I should've gotten tested, all my symptoms aside from a sore throat and body were gone. Tests weren't available in my county at the time and I feel like its pointless now. But jesus, it was honest to god, awful.",1601510494

Sure, is it confirmed? No. (As far as I knew, unless further info was made available ...? these reports are unconfirmed, not “total BS”). The handling of these reports was irresponsible. The WH appeared to dismiss these reports out of hand, then released statements undermining the credibility of their own intelligence services, which compounds the issue. How about “The President takes these reports very seriously and will be looking into them?” Oh no, we have to call them “rogue intelligence members leaking info” etc. This is one example of the frequent WH undermining. 

Intelligence is usually unconfirmed in the early stages, particularly if it’s something being hidden well. The President’s job is to take intelligence seriously &amp; support his agencies further investigations. This was handled the same way as the reports of foreign election interference.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;The issue I have is when someone tells me that even though I agree, and they agree, and all parties involved agree, that my contract with them is invalid because you said so.

No one said that. You asked if you could replace workers with robots, and I said you have to vote on it. 

&gt;You also seem to be distorting workplace democracy and national democracy. If a small business democratically operates, I'm not sure what private property relations or elite class have to do with that decision.

No. I am extending democratic principles into the workplace because democracy in a liberal capitalist democracy is narrowly applied and influenced my the authoritarian structures inherent to corporate entities. 

&gt;Again, you can run your ship democratically if you want, go nuts, but saying everyone has to is absolutely immoral, and not libertarian.

It's not immoral, it's called skin in the game. If a decision effects someone, they should be involved in the decision making process.

&gt;Thus, if you and a doctor washed up on a desert island, you could not morally force him to provide you with healthcare, as that would infringe on his rights. 

Yeah, I agree. But I don't live on an deserted island with a doctor. I live in a society where doctors are not compelled by gunpoint to help anyone by and large, but costs lead patients into medical bankruptcy. Having a large national insurance pool ensures that people have access to health care. This is the right thing to do given that these illnesses and accidents are largely out of our control. 

&gt;However, for it to be voluntary, one must also be able to refuse to do so.

On principle this allows people to refuse to sell cakes for gay weddings. This would not be a tolerant society and I sacrifice the voluntary principle for real-world decency. 

&gt;Ancaps generally oppose this model, as it calls for wealth redistribution. Seizing people's wealth by force is absolutely incongruent with libertarian philosophy.

Understandable because ancaps are capitalists. Socialists employ a Marxist approach to understand wealth distribution. The political economic analysis by Marx describes capitalists as parasites that exploit the working class (he does a lot more than just this). Under this framework, wealth redistribution is really returning what was stolen from an exploitative capitalist class. I don't share your concern with forceful seizure of wealth when that wealth was stolen. 

&gt;Also, while I couldn't find a stat for how many worker owned companies exist in Sweden, I would love to have a source for it, if you have one!

I don't have one. The history of the Meidner plan was such that there was rightward shift that halted and killed the transition. So, perhaps Sweden is no different from other European countries. Mondragon in Spain is a well-example of a highly successful cooperative. 

&gt;Listen dude, using force against people who have not harmed you is incredibly immoral. Find some people and make a worker union! Go nuts! Nothing is stopping you. Just don't force others to do your bidding because you think you know better than two consenting adults in a completely voluntary agreement. This is not remotely libertarian, as you claimed.

First of all, I don't know where I have ever endorsed violence in this conversation. Second, this is a narrow analysis. The shear precariousness of the working class creates a very difficult calculus: they need work, they have to work a lot, and they will only scrape by + engaging in the means to demand better work conditions (e.g., unions) can risk their work. Third, your view of harm is narrow, and it ignores the harm of general poverty. 

&gt;But can't you at least concede that forcing people to do this would not be good? If your ideology can only be maintained by force, does that not leave a bad taste in your mouth? Can your ends really justify the means?

Unionizing is violent and forceful? I've only advocated for peaceful means, so yeah the ends do justify the means. Ancaps on the other hand endorse capitalism, which leads to massive exploitation and depends on violence to protect the right of capitalists to expand their production.",1601510496

Also make sure he know it’s your first time! Don’t be afraid to speak up. Have him touch and tease your butt, and when it’s time to go beyond that tell him to be gentle.  Finger first, when that’s ok, go to 2, then 3.  Once you feel comfortable let him slowly press his penis inside. Pause if you need to, until your muscles relax then go a tiny bit further.  Having him reassure you with positive comments may also help.  

Once he’s in, pause to let your body adjust.  Then slowly let him slide back and forth bit by bit.  Eventually you’ll get up to speed and find a rhythm that’s right for you both.  

Have a safe word, and if you need to stop, stop! Sometimes a guy can go in at a wrong angle and it really hurts.  So have him pull out and you both adjust so he comes at you from a different angle.

Suboxone would 100% get you off kratom. I’ve actually never met anyone or much much about people doing this though. It’s more potent and would get you off without disrupting your life. 

I’m wondering if you got on a tiny tiny dose of subs, not enough to feel any bit of a buzz but make it so you can live normally, how a taper off the subs would work. If one can be  very careful with a taper and not try to get a buzz from them (they’ll most likely give you a weeks worth, around me that’s how I works,) it would be doable. 

The only issue is if one is on them too long, the WD (RLS and such,) was way more gnarly then kratom. How long have you been stable at 15-20gpd? 

If you enjoy smoking weed, and have access to gabapentin for short term, that would be my recipe for success. THC helped my opiate WD in the past",1601510498

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","&gt; who the fuck cares?

Not you or 99% of people who just look for a cheap laugh on the internet, never thinking about the person who got their privacy invaded for it, which is a big change the internet has caused in our culture that I'm not a fan of. 

This isn't a particularly egregious example, its a relatively wholesome moment, but it's still this girl's private moment that got blown up online. A ton of stuff that's more mean spirited in nature gets on the front page of reddit all the time, like screenshots of kids' bad haircuts on r/justfuckmyshitup, or teenagers' ""cringey"" posts to their personal FB that get screenshotted and put on r/iamverysmart or something. 

People always say something like ""It’s not like she posted her name or can even see her face."" Yeah YOU can't identify them, but being on the front page of reddit as a subject of laughter isn't just about all the people of reddit identifying you, it's about you knowing reddit's laughing at you, and about the people around you who *do* know who you are and know that you blew up on reddit getting laughed at. When some teen gets laughed at on one of those subs mocking haircuts or screengrabbed social posts, reddit doesn't know who they are, but their schoolmates def know who they are and that they got mocked worldwide on reddit. 

Sorry to go on a rant but one of my biggest issues with reddit is this weird bullying culture it enables and fosters. All of a sudden people who aren't bullies IRL participate in anonymous mass bullying and completely believe it's not bullying because it's so mainstream.",1601510499

And when hovering doesn't work they'll escalate again and again until they succeed. To Narcissists going NC is an insult.

Yet, something might still be going on that's under wraps. Why virtually no new footage so far? Why so much old material? Why do weeks and weeks pass without any hints of activity on OI from 'Other side of the Causeway' (not even pontoon or kayak trips)'?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I started seeing a new partner in March, both of us are STD/STI free and don't use condoms. After about a week I developed a strange odor, did an STD/STI test that was all clear but was positive for bacterial vaginosis... no big deal, went on antibiotics and it cleared up. About two weeks later I have BV again with another clean STD/STI test. Okay, another round of antibiotics, and it cleared up. This cycle has repeated for about six months now. 

I saw my OGBYN who conducted an ultrasound to ensure my IUD placement was still correct and everything looked normal. They had no answers and no solutions beyond that. 
 
After things cleared up again my partner and I tried the pull out method and I had no change in smell or discharge. Decided to try not pulling out as things had been normal for about a month, within hours the smell returned. I was tested for STD/STI and BV and was negative for both! Smell remained for several weeks but cleared up on its own with no sex. 

I follow all precautions to avoid BV/yeast infections including probiotics. I don't experience traditional symptoms of semen allergy such as hives, burning, or swelling, just a unpleasant change in odor and thicker discharge. Has anyone experienced something similar? Am I allergic to my partner's semen, and are there any solutions or ideas for dealing with this? Help!",1601510501

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Trying to look at it objectively, I don't think the debate taught us anything. It was more the sort of test you'd expect someone to undergo on a reality TV show than a test of how well someone would govern. 

The reality TV show premise- we'll put a candidate up against someone who will try to bully him, talk over him, and avoid any substantive issues. Can he handle it? 

From my perspective, who cares? That's not what someone in office faces, nor is it something we want them to face. Debates with others can be seen as a test of sorts. How well can a candidate define and defend their positions against opposition and under live pressure?  That matters, at least somewhat.  This? A farce.

I saw little reality TV, but did see how the producers would play it. A heel would undermine a well meaning contestant. Which gets eliminated? they scold the heel for working against the team and for being deceptive and destructive. Then they say that they eliminate the well meaning contestant for not overcoming the malicious interference. On reality tv, that keeps the bad guy around for future ratings purposes. In reality, you kick the bad guy.",1601510501

"enoughpetersonspam","t5_3p0xk","Yeah, because they were pretty ardently libertarian as well as materialist. Raoul Vaneigem says that all hierarchies have to be destroyed, which is a fierce critique of both capitalism and authoritarian communism. He says that if the destruction of hierarchies isn’t the aim of the revolution, then it will essentially lead to the same problems as capitalism. So I understand why that would be controversial among communists.

The Situationists were kind of quasi-anarchists. I kind of saw them as being in a corrupted, deconstructed grey area between postmodernism and Marxism because of that. The anti-totalitarian defiance of all hierarchal categories and the insistence that the material conditions of capitalism are anti-life. 

My criticism of Peterson isn’t necessarily the fact that he blurs postmodernism and Marxism, it’s the fact that he isn’t specific about what this compromised, deconstructed combination of the two would actually have to be in order to be a coherent theory. It’s just a catch-all term for anyone who challenges traditional hierarchies. Also he inherently links this combination of the two to authoritarianism, when that is clearly absurd in any postmodern belief system that rejects overarching categories on the very basis that they are authoritarian. I suggest that if any form of postmodern NeoMarxism did exist, it would be closer to generally anti-hierarchical anarchism, that rejects capitalist forms of organisation as Marxism does. Basically, what the Situationists and Dadaists did. Also the fact that the art in these two movements used blatant intertextuality, blurred high and low art and commented on its own purpose helps my argument as these are staples of postmodern art, before postmodern art existed. Many self-referential internet memes do the same thing.",1601510501

I remember the time we were presenting something for our art class and I helped on a major part of the presentation for the photos of the installation but my mom got really ill so I had to drop everything and take her to the hospital and stuff cuz my parents were in the middle of a really bad divorce.  I missed the presentation and got an F on the project and ended up having to retake the class.  Fortunately w/ a different instructor and aced the presentation the following semester.

But what I found out was that one of the group members made the excuse that they felt really uncomfortable presenting because I wasn't going to be there, and decided to basically rework it from the ground up.  As it turns out they just didn't like me but different story.  Anyway, they decided to change up the entire prezzo but all our names were still on it.

I tried to explain it to the instructor and they were like ""welp, that's too bad"", ""try again next year"" (that section was only offered during the spring semester) ""and chalk this up to life exp"".  I gave them a really bad review that semester, wrote another one on rate my professor (might've been taken down due to language and other suggestive things) and complained to admin.  

But as with many art programs, they only care about making money and just said some BS like I had to be in class x amount of days and that I have to give them notice if I'm going to leave a class and it was already too late to drop a section.

"Turkey","t5_2qlnu","I don’t think anybody will point this out, but I’ll say this about the said neighbourhoods:

**Look for new buildings.**  These buildings might be a little out of the neighbourhoods but living in a newly-built building means you’re a lot more prone to a possible earthquake. These neighbourhoods have buildings that are almost a century or more years old and it is very well known that Istanbul is going to suffer a big earthquake in the next ~20 years (could be tomorrow, could be 20 years from now, no one knows.) I suggest you play it safe.

Also, I lived and worked in the heart of Moda, Kadıköy for 2 years and while I think it is the most laid-back place in the whole country, that brings its own problems. We’d have people drinking right in our doorsteps every weekend, imagine how comfortable we were. This is a very rare occurance, but we were followed, harrassed and beaten **in our building** late at night once and since there were no cameras anywhere around, they got away with it.  As for Beşiktaş, I can’t tell much. I honestly like Kadıköy better since I lived there for two years and still go there to hang out at least once a week .

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","I am the ultimate alpha male. I only climax for 1 of 2 reasons. I either climax for the purpose of reproduction with a beautiful woman (because that's the only kind of woman worthy of me) or I climax for the purpose of free protein. I need immense protein to maintain my ultimate alpha male body, and 4-5 cum loads a day is sufficient for me. It's not gay it its mine, but I wouldn't expect you pathetic beta males to understand. I bet you waste your seed into napkins, tissue, and tube socks. How sad, wasting all that protein. Wasting all those offspring. Its optimal for me to masturbate with my legs over my head so I can practice stretching before my workout while I obtain my protein. All the gym betas in the locker room just look away in disgust, but again, I wouldn't be offended by an asshole who only focus on vanity muscles. You beta losers better start acting like real men.

"copypasta","t5_2r6z7","“D-Donald-senpai~” Biden whimpered, looking into Donald’s golden orbs as he felt the calloused hand roaming down his front, quickly travelling to dangerous places.

“You had your mouth so wide open at the debate yesterday, and now your producing nothing more than a whimper”

Biden grew hard at the sweet words Trump whispered to him.

“how about we put that mouth to better use?~”. Trump continued, raising both of his arms to the shoulders of Biden, before pushing him down onto his frail knees.

Biden immediately got to work, fiddling with the zipper on the oh so big trousers with something bigger waiting for him.

A hard cock sprung up to his face, and a bead of sweat gathered on his head.

“D-Donald-senpai, you’re way too big! There’s no way i can-“ Biden said, before Donald shoved his cock into the pretty pink lips of Biden.

A moan left both the wrinkled men as the strokes got faster and harder.

Eyes wide, Biden wasn’t prepared for the sticky, white substance to be shot down his throat.

Like a good boy, Biden took it and placed his tongue out and rolled his eyes back to show Donald his love for him.

“L-look Donald-senpai. Look how pretty i am with your cum!”

Donald dismissed the man by coming closer to him and whispering “I told you your mouth would be used for good.”

With those words, Biden came himself, high pitched moan.

“UGH WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP DONNNALLLLLL”

A knock on the door brought the two back to reality.

Biden’s assistant Demetri was here to take him to his next meeting.

1. Tobacco is *physiologically* addictive. There are changes to the body that happen with consumption, and physical withdrawal symptoms when consumption is ceased. Facebook is only 'psychologically addictive' (the use of 'addiction' to refer to things that do not cause chemical dependency is controversial; I'm being generous here). You quit facebook today... and nothing happens to you. The difficulty of quitting tobacco and social media aren't remotely on the same plane, and people can be 'trapped' by chemical addiction in a way that simply doesn't apply to a website.
2. Tobacco companies were proven to have been *deceptive*. While facebook has its secrets and I think you can claim it has been *misleading* with regards to its privacy settings over the years, the essential way it operates has never been a secret. It builds profiles of its users and shows them content likely to keep them on the platform, and also increasingly targeted ads. Unlike the early days of tobacco, people who engage with facebook know exactly what they are getting.
3. As a general rule, while individual companies might be punished for breaking laws, we do not target individual companies for societal ills. Doing so would just cause other companies to work around the law. Even if you wanted to regulate 'facebook' you wouldn't do it by name; you would regulate social media in general. This would be extremely challenging because you would have to figure out what, exactly the objectional behavior is. Is it just recommending content that the customer is likely to be interested in? Nearly every company on the planet does this, from netflix to my local grocery store. Is it the anonymity and lack of barrier to entry? But these things are part of what makes the internet so great, providing voice to the disenfranchised, and allowing persecuted groups to meet in private. Is it the fact that dangerous people ... the wrong people ... have so much power there? If so, do you want the Government deciding who the dangerous people are? No doubt the current American president would find my ideas threatening; thankfully he doesn't get to decide.
4. This is somewhat related to 3, but social media (assuming you don't mean the specific company ""facebook"") is not  easily definable, and that's the first step to regulating something. Tobacco is somewhat easier because it is a plant, and it still provides challenges as novel products emerge (vaping). How do you define what a social network is so you can pass laws about it? Is Reddit social media? Is a blog with an active comments section social media? Is a heavily moderated web forum social media? Does moderation matter at all?

Just a few thoughts.",1601510504

If you want to play in full sessions and not lobby jump to find better lobbies you’re just gonna have to accept that of the 20+ people someone is guaranteed to be an asshole. I’m level 300 and I’ve never found killing other players fun and don’t really understand why people enjoy it. I’ve had people like you (lower levels) then attempt to kill me because I was just riding a bmx so it’s not a level thing. Anyone can and will be an asshole if they want to. Personally I’d advise you to find single or low player count sessions with friends. Then if someone joins and is a twat you can kick him via the online / players tab. 

Matchmaking won’t work either as bank accounts are shared between characters. So a level 800 like my friend has 50 mill he can just throw into his level 20 and start killing players who don’t have all the big toys. 

My only other suggestion is look into investing into antigrief vehicles. Anything that can essentially take a few rockets and fire back at them. Not everyone is an asshole tho and some people will come to your help when they see a level 300 on an oppressor mk2 bullying you.",1601510505

I bet you waste your seed into napkins, tissue, and tube socks. How sad, wasting all that protein. Wasting all those offspring.

Nowhere in that exchange is it me asking him if it is spicy. Its being shoved in my face and despite me mentioning how other people always say that (that something isn't spicy) and it always ends up being spicy. He proceeds to still insist no, this time is somehow different than every other time people have claimed something like that. That it's not ""spicy-spicy"".

As I mentioned in another reply, people who like spicy seem to take it as a personal affront when I say I don't like spicy and get pushy about me trying whatever the food in question is regardless of me already saying no multiple times.

"IdiotsInCars","t5_3aimx","&gt; A criminal defendant cannot be compelled to produce the weapons
used for the commission of a crime or the fruits of a crime because he is protected by the privilege against self-incrimination. The reasoning behind this rule usually asserts that if he were compelled to produce the physical evidence he would be ""testifying"" that the item produced is the item demanded."" The prosecution may, however, obtain the evidence through the use of a search warrant This is not ""testimonial"" on the defendant's part because the prosecution must prove his con- nection with the item produced. To compel the defendant's attorney to produce the evidence would, seemingly, be similar to compelling the client to testify. 

Discovery is a one way street. The defense has no obligation to share the evidence they have. The onus is on the state to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. The defense can withhold damning evidence, and share only evidence that helps their case. 

Now if they’re planning to use evidence in court, then yes it would be shared during pre trial motions, but you don’t have to share everything you have

"hockey","t5_2qiel","1. You're still completely oblivious to the larger implications of this. 
2. Again - you need to educate yourself on medical economics and opportunity costs - deaths from lockdowns will far exceed COVID deaths. By saying you don't care about economics you don't care about evaluations of policies for the future, impacts of policies, effectiveness, etc. 
3. Apparently you don't see the difference between assets appreciating in value and tax credits for businesses. Own a home? Guess what your net worth likely went up. Have money in a 401(k) or IRA? Net worth probably went up. My portfolio is up 40% YTD - no different than what the link is describing. Given you don't understand this difference it's quite obvious why you fail at analyzing data and models here. Tell me, do you understand what a Bayesian model is?
4. Never dismissed the deaths - actually made it a point that it's very segmented. If you knew anything about my statement you'd understand that people who are at higher risk should take extra precautions but you don't lockdown a healthy population to beat a virus.

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
&gt;/r/memes/about/rules

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

Thanks for understanding.

Honestly the most depressing part was loss of taste and smell. Not being able to really move around or take care of myself coupled with barely any appetite meant when it came time to eat the total lack of flavor was a real bummer and made eating even less desirable. I lost 15 pounds in 10 days. 

Also for me when I say loss of taste it was like when you drink water straight from the tap you get this mild “flavor”, it was similar to that but much more amplified but constantly for a week.

Biden was barely able to get a word in and whenever he did, nothing of value was said (otherwise the news networks would’ve been talking about it). But nope, the only “valuable” thing Joe said the entire evening was “Would you just shutup man” LMAO. 

I think Trump won that debate. Whenever he spoke and wasn’t yelling over Biden, he made good points. Next time I hope he lets Joe ramble uninterrupted so that we can see that he really has no good plans as President. Don’t care for your downvotes as they’d only be proving my point lmfao",1601510509

 Wood nymphs are spirits of the forest, able to bind themselves with a tree and animate it as though it were the body. They can survive for as long as their tree does, so even though they may travel from it in spirit, they do not often do so as the tree may need their protection.

 River nymphs are spirits of freshwater locales. They are amphibious and carnivorous, having no issue eating humans. They can direct fish and other non-mammalian, non-magical aquatic life with mere thoughts, and will often utilize this ability to lure unwary fishermen to their demise.

 Stone nymphs are spirits of the mountain, capable of moving through earth and stone as though it were water. They also possess the ability of psychometry; any stone they touch will present them with memories of the stone as it was touched by others.",1601510509

"de","t5_22i0","&gt;&gt; und zweitens sind diese Nebenwirkungen unter anderem andauernde Sterilität bei 5-10% der Tester und markant gesteigerte Selbstmordraten.
&gt;
&gt;Frauen leiden ebenfalls an durch die Pille bedingte Depressionen die durchaus zu Suiziden führen. 

Ohne über spezifische Medikamente zu sprechen kann ich da nicht viel dazu sagen. Depressionen sind ""mood disorders"", das sagt über die schwere nix aus. Bei zumindest einem Versuch - das war eine Depotspritze, aber das exakte Medikament müsste ich zu googlen versuchen - wurden vollendete Suizide in der Eingangsphase registriert. Das tut die Pille nicht. Zugelassene Anti-Baby-Pillen machen auch nicht jede zehnte Benutzerin dauerhaft unfruchtbar.

&gt;&gt; Was für eine widerliche Geringschätzung männlichen Lebens.
&gt;
&gt;Was für eine hohle Behauptung. Viel eher eine Geringschätzung weiblichen Lebens. Für Frauen wurde es auf den Markt gebracht,

Die Pille würde heute auch nicht mehr durch die Zulassungsverfahren kommen, weil einerseits die Regulierung und das zugehörige Studie Design viel strenger ist, und zum anderen der politische Zeitgeist ein anderer ist. Moderne Präparate vermutlich schon, da fehlt mir die Expertise.

&gt; für Männer weigert man sich

Man weigert sich nicht ""für Männer"". Ein Medikament gegen z.B. Regelschmerzen, dass unfruchtbar macht oder in klinischen Studien vollendete Suizide erzeugt würde vermutlich genauso nicht zugelassen.

Das ist aber sowieso alles wurscht, denn wennst argumentierst, dass man manche Pillen strikter regulieren sollte - in vielen Ländern ist die Pille OTC zu haben wie Aspirin - kommt dann nämlich sofort der Mysogynie-Vorwurf, und so von eigenen Gedanken befreite Mem-Überträger, die was von der Gratis-Pille beim Würstelstand, wären nur Männer betroffen, schwafeln. So richtet man es sich dann.


&gt; Nur weil ich dies erwähne, habe ich gleich was gegen Männer? 

Weil du auf ""gender policing"" und Stereotype zurückgreifst, indem du Männer als Schwächlinge verhämst.

 Weil du die viel gravierenderen Folgen minimierst, wie das in genau dem selben hämischen Ton in zig ""feminstischen"" Blogs passiert.

Weil dein erster Gedanke, wenn du liest, dass ein Medikament für Männer wegen schwerer Nebenwirkungen einen sofortigen Studienabbruch in der Eingangsphase ausgelöst hat, ist, dass die blöden Männer da nur herumjammern. 

&gt; Nirgends sage ich, dass Männer leiden sollen.

Nein, du sagst nur, dass die männliche Jammerlapprigkeit und nicht etwa tatsächliche, materielle Gründe verantwortlich sind für den Mangel hormoneller Verhütung für Männer.

Wie das Sterben, und die Unfruchtbarkeit.


&gt;Ich bin auch nicht überzeugt von der Pille für die Frau. Es sollte viel mehr an weiteren Alternativen geforscht werden. Die gesundheitlichen Komplikationen sind auf Dauer eher fragwürdig. 

Ja, sehe ich auch so.",1601510510

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","I pray you come to your senses and escape from the snare of doing the devil’s will. *Do you understand*? ““Do not judge so that you will not be judged. For in the way you judge, you will be judged; and by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you.” — Matthew‬ ‭7:1-2‬ ‭

Stop condemning people. But you will say, “ I haven’t condemned anybody”—but the words I read from you say otherwise. 

“The Lord’s bond-servant must not be quarrelsome, but be kind to all, able to teach, patient when wronged, with gentleness correcting those who are in opposition, if perhaps God may grant them repentance leading to the knowledge of the truth, and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, **having been held captive by him to do his will**.”
‭‭
&gt;You didn't answer my question about compassion ""man is not above his teacher"" and all that is again talking about something completely different. We are to have mercy on other humans because we're all sinners.

Blessings—I did answer the question. It is enough for the disciple that he become like his teacher..........As it is written 

&gt;As we say in the Lord's Prayer forgive us our sins as we forgive those who sin against us. 

Yes—Just as Jesus taught us to pray. He also prayed to the Father 🥰

&gt;That's not compassion and it has nothing to do with God's compassion regarding salvation and eternal punishment.

Did you never read Jonah? God is compassionate —“Should I not have compassion on Nineveh, the great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons who do not know the difference between their right and left hand, as well as many animals?”” — Jonah‬ ‭4:11‬ ‭

&gt;And the passage in John 20 it's not what you think it is either. Let's look at the details. This is after the resurrection,  the disciples have closed themselves once again in a private room so it's only them separated from the world. in Jesus comes to them miraculously and he breathed on them and he tells them  that they have the authority to forgive or retain sins.

Great. I too have the Holy Spirit. I was sealed :) Also, was the conversation about us doing greater things than Jesus, was that just for those select few in the Bible? Well, I kindly disagree—as it is written: “**And have mercy on some, who are doubting**; **save others, snatching them out of the fire**; **and on some have mercy with fear, hating even the garment polluted by the flesh**.” —Jude‬ ‭1:22-23‬ ‭

&gt;This is not something that's given to the entire church but only to a select few which, is the apostles or the leaders of his church. And it's not about compassion it's about reconciliation.

I am the church. So are you. So are all of God’s children. Have faith in God 🥰",1601510511

"synthesizers","t5_2rdyc","&gt; I think ideally I really want to play around a lot with a sequencer that I can set up with drum lines and bass lines and then play over it.

Making music this way is a lot of fun. What you probably want then is some kind of *groovebox*, which is an all-in-one machine that can do drums, melodic lines, and sequence. The Digitakt you mention below can definitely do this. The Novation Circuit, Roland MC-101, and any of the Akai MPCs are other examples in this category.

&gt; If it means multiple devices as the best way to go, that's fine I just kinda want a general ""outline"" of where to go first.

You can definitely get it all in one box, though as you can imagine your options and ability to specialize goes up if you get a few separate pieces of hardware. But also the cost, complexity, and analysis paralysis goes up too, and you lose some portability. A lot of people go in this direction by getting a couple of Korg Volcas and hooking them up together. Personally, I think it's better to get a single more powerful box instead of a few limited ones where you then have to burn some cash on cables and a mixer to hook it up.

&gt; From what I've seen, I don't think I have the patience to deal with a fully modular setup, though.

You're probably right. That's jumping in the deep end.

&gt; I think I can just plug the 88-key via midi into it and I'll be able to control it that way. Hopefully that's correct.

Correct!

&gt; So one of the first synths that caught my eye was the Arturia Matrixbrute just due to the crazy featureset that was available.

It is really cool, but probably overkill.

&gt; I think it's also not polyphonic (although all the other features probably make up for that fact).

Correct, it's monophonic.

&gt; Prophet Rev2, ASM Hydrasynth, Deepmind 6/12, Korg Prologue, Minilogue

All of these are excellent polyphonic synths. I wouldn't worry *too* much about limited oscillator waveshapes. Subtractive synthesis (which is what all of these synths use) is basically about starting with a couple of simple waveforms and then using filters, envelopes, and modulation to bring them to life.

&gt; though I can't tell if the keyboard or desktop version would be ""better"" for my needs

If you already have a keyboard that you like the feel of, there's an argument that you may as well get the desktop and avoid buying a redundant keybed. On the other hand, if you want it all in one device, maybe it's worth it to you to have the complete synth.

&gt; Other stuff I've looked at are things like the Electron Digitakt (this seemed interesting to me but looked like a lot of menu diving and a huge learning curve so I'm a bit off-put by it)

The Digitakt is beloved for good reason and would cover the drums and bass that you want and also let you sequence any other synths you get. It is *not* polyphonic for its own sampler tracks, but it *can* sequence other instruments over MIDI polyphonically.

It's not a lot of menu *diving*. Elektron does a *really* good job with how the screen and knobs interact, so you're almost never more than a single button press away from any setting. There is a learning curve, but for what it's worth, I *love* using the Elektron sequencer. I often find more enjoyable than a full-featured DAW.

&gt; and a whole workstation like the Korg Kross 88.

I don't know much about workstations. Not my thing.

&gt; if there is something that fits what I want I'm willing to save for it, but I guess lets just try to stick to under $2k.

You can make a lot of great sounds for well under $2k. If you really want backing tracks and the ability to sequence, I'd suggest starting with a groovebox first. Then maybe expand to a poly synth (which you can sequence using the groovebox) later. Or if you want to focus on the synth first, get one of the polys and then later add a groovebox (or just sequence using your DAW).

It looks like you're thinking through the right things, so you'll do fine. Trust your gut, and remember you can always sell or return gear. Sometimes you have to have it in your hands for a while to see if it's going to gel with you.",1601510511

"PlayAvengers","t5_1276pu","So I’m reaaaally loving this build so far. All I really want now is better stat roles. Might and valor instead of intensity. Also, crit chance is low because damage buff completely makes up for that. Start a fight with his odinforce R2 beam, guaranteed damage buff proc. Then go in to full combo, using your artifact right after warriors fury, so you’ll have full battery and damage buff through the entire combo. Warriors fury allows you to get crits off, which then trigger invulnerability buff, which allows you to unload signature combos. 

Anytime damage buff runs out, throw 1-3 ranged power attacks (10-20k damage) and it’ll proc again. Crit chance is 60% so one signature attack will start the invulnerability buff chain. Rinse and repeat. 

One full combo decimated and nearly wiped an elite squad, 2-3 combos wipe bosses. Really easy to get off just damage buff + invulnerability buff combos between the heroic combos. 

Heroic combos are 3 perk battery procs, regular signature combos are 2 because of the innate shock damage. 

Like I said, just need some better stat rolls, but this build feels tough, balanced, easy and amazing. It all synergizes well.",1601510512

Only one box open at a time. Only what you need right then out of the box. Not well ok, I‘m gonna do that right after I’m done with this so I’ll leave this paper out. NO. Put it back. Slam down the lid. Finish the one thing you pulled out. Mail it. File it. Shred it. We cannot file 10 pieces of different papers at a time. Can’t. Ok. Can’t. So don’t waste time trying. Just put the rest back. “Take what you need and leave the rest.”

Don’t ask me why. They don’t even talk to me. They’re not supervising. It’s company. That’s all. A body.

You can't take the blood pressure of a person with an LVAD or 2 VADs the normal way, you have to use other methods, since there isn't that pulsatile flow through the whole circulatory system. Blood pressure in the US is usually given in mmHg but psi would work too.

In subreddits that have Community Points, polls have two sets of results:

1. The normal count, where one member gets one vote.
2. The weighted count, where members get one vote for every Point they have.

By giving weight to votes, Community Points let a community see how core contributors feel about a question or decision.

**Can someone buy the vote then?**

No. To keep things fair, a person’s weight in a poll is capped by the total number of Points they've ever earned. Even if they receive additional Points from tips or transfers, their vote can never exceed the number of Points they have actually earned themselves.",1601510513

"skyrimmods","t5_2sqqh","The projects I generally work on add new gameplay mechanics and systems. Draw, for example, allows the player to enter a unique duel state with an NPC. When in the midst of the duel, there are a number of unique mechanics involved. If initiated without a weapon, the duel will be a fist fight. Your opponent may pull a weapon if you do, or if they are particularly coward and their wounds get to them. They may also opt to run away entirely. Death isn’t prevented, but if you’re careful you can injure them into a custom unconscious state at which point you have a number of options for how to deal with them. Rob them, sheathe and let them up, execute them, etc. 

Now, I made this mod years ago and wouldn’t touch it without a full refactor. The engineering isn’t up to my standards. That alone should give you an indication that there is some room to gain meaningful experience modding. Further, I could build this mod into a full-scale API that other mods integrate with. Someone else’s quest mod could trigger a duel, query the duel state, and respond accordingly. The quest could respond to whether you spared your opponent or they ran away, or if you pulled your knife in a brawl.

Or we could look at Signature Equipment. Skipping over it’s implementation, I’ve recently been optimizing the mod. Using profiling data, I’ve been able to refactor the scripts to perform the same upgrade process 10x faster thanks in large part to memoization. Previously the performance was pretty trivial, but the requirements changed when I extended support for up to 10 followers.

You both have your choices in life; she's been allowed to make hers with no regard for anyone else, you are allowed to make the choice to put yourself first for once 

Depending on what state you are in, or should your mother ever decide to move with/for your sister again, I recommend looking into Kentucky or Florida. Both states allow families to petition the courts to force adults into drug rehabilitation programs. In Kentucky this is through Casey's law (which says families are responsible for the cost but insurance has always paid for it), and in Florida it is under the Baker Act. This might allow your mother the final glimmer of hope she's looking for without you feeling you have to get involved.

* **5**\-**alpha** reductase is essentially responsible for converting one hormone(chemical) into another throughout the body and the brain- one of these conversions is Testosterone to DHT- hence why you are able to use Fin for reducing the progression of hair loss (DHT is thought to me the main contributor to the miniaturization of follicles on the top of the scalp)

   * Your brain and body rely on the **5**\-**alpha** reductase (which Fin reduces to a small fraction of what it is normally at) to create hormones that are crucial to its health

   * Some of these ""chemicals"" that are a product of the reduction via 5-alpha are neurosteroids 

      * Neurosteroids promote a healthy brain 

      * Lack of neurosteroids in brain can cause issues with depression, lack of sleep, anxiety, lack of focus, memory, and many more. 

      * The most significant neurosteroid reduces to almost nothing is allopregnanolone - this is LITERALLY what we are spending billions of dollars to manufacture today to fight depression in women with menaupause who are known to have low levels of this neurosteroid",1601510516

I find a lot of the time it depends on the weather and day. Rainy mondays are going to net more straight coffee or lattes, hot weekends are iced tea and refreshers. It can also depend on time of day. Obviously we see more retired older folks or people heading to their jobs early in the morning and are aching for caffeine. Towards the end of the school day is a rush of teens wanting treats. Which then turns into study groups! 

You’ll have regulars, but not every regular is there every day. We have people that only show up on days where we’re offering specials like double star days.

You do realise this lack of discourse down south is precisely due to this type of behaviour right? You're not different than any of those yokel's going REEEEE.

In any case, economics like any field of study is complex. They don't always have the answers and it's up to us to judge, however when it comes to government spending there are models to follow - the models may be different but they're models nonetheless. If you what you're prescribing doesn't fit into something that works, they'll let you know. This guy's fucking winging it.

By the fucking way, cutting tax doesn't necessarily mean a business will spend or invest it. As we saw from the massive experience down south, business can be quite lazy with it and just pocket it or give it right back to owners. Who then do the lazy thing and put it in assets. Some would argue it's more productive to keep the tax as it's may be productive in the areas it's already being spent on - healthcare, education, etc.

I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about on real estate, but on this particular issue it's pretty transparent that this is some weird hail mary by Andrew Wilkinson. Yes cutting taxes is actually a form of stimulus, but that has to be paired with austerity. If we're cutting taxes, I demand austerity. What a numbskull suggestion, right after we've just given away so much to prop people up during the shutdown.

I would also recommend an additional tax break given to businesses so that they can put money into IT projects needed to validate all the changes they'll need to make in finance.

"SoundSystem","t5_2sz02","&gt; it doesn't have any option for ""speaker fill"" or ""stereo widening"". These options are generally in the audio driver software, that will upscale stereo to desired surround setup. 

from what I know ,the files I'm playing should have 5.1 sound in them and there shouldn't be a need for these features...

&gt; If possible I'd try running audio out of the Realtek chip 

the Realtek chip is connected only to the audio jacks and not the HDMI so I'll have to get another 3-3.5mm cables, optical cable and a converter to connect it to the TV. that is something I really don't wanna do...

&gt; I'd have to say its probably due to the Intel graphics driver 

I checked all the drivers and it's really weird:  


|PC (current)|Asus website (non CSM)|Asus website (CSM) |
|:-|:-|:-|
|intel graphics 27.20.100.8587 |26.20.100.6952 (called VGA driver) |25.20.100.6471 |
|intel display audio 10.27.0.9 | doesn't show |doesn't show|
|Realtek HD audio 6.0.1.7841 |6.0.8702.1 |6.0.1.8573 |
|chipset [10.1.11.4](https://10.1.11.4/) (says its from July 18th 1968 and still doesn't need an update???) |1914.12.0.1256 |1828.12.0.1152  |

as you can see the PC has a newer driver version than specified on the manufacturer website.(for the intel graphics)  
also my MOBO is ASUS H310M-E rev 2.0/CSM and I don't know if I should use the CSM drivers or the non-CSM... the CSM drivers are older and the boards are practically the same...",1601510518

"TheCinemassacreTruth","t5_3k1fw","&gt;I would have to say in the Rise of Skywalker movie review, James said he’s not gonna see anymore Star Wars movies that come out because he has “no time”. As if he doesn’t have time to watch a 2 hour movie throughout the entire year. Smh

Why can't he just say he doesn't feel like seeing the new movies because he doesn't particularly like them and wouldn't find it worth his time when he could be doing something he'd get more fulfillment from? Is he ashamed?

In general, what's the point of people saying ""I don't have time"" when they obviously do and instead should be saying, ""I'd prefer not to make time for this."" (Since there's nothing wrong with that.)

James is far from the only person to talk this way. It's an interesting phenomena. Probably most frequently used as a more dishonestly courteous way of expressing the fact that you don't care enough to do something.",1601510518

"uruguay","t5_2qmvj","Ojo, soy conciente que el lenguaje inclusivo puede parecer una imposición, y hasta pareciera que están forzando el cambio acelerando un proceso. O sea, que no sería un cambio orgánico sino que algo pensado. Pero si leés al Quijote, por ejemplo, te vas a encontrar con una variedad de español muy distinta a la que se habla ahora.

Igualmente hay que acordarse que el idioma es un reflejo de la mente de sus hablantes, y en este cambio de paradigma (en que la sociedad está buscando tener máyor igualdad de género) tiene sentido que quieran cambiar el idioma. Esto de que el idioma es reflejo de la mente de sus hablantes lo podés leer de Cary, que estudió las lenguas indígenas norteamericanas para compararlas con las europeas, y también lo podés leer de Ferdinand de Saussure, que dijo ""todo es psicológico en la lengua""

Te voy a nombrar a una de las lingüistas a la que noble gusta la rae y estoy seguro que ni te vas a molestar en buscar ni una publicación: Alma Pedretti. Es uruguaya, la madre de Alma Bolón, y escribió un artículo en contra de las academias de lenguas que está impresionante. Otro es Ferdinand de Saussure, que si bien no escribio sobre la rae escribió sobre la academia de lenguas francesa

Yo amo a la lengua española, pero odio a la rae, porque intenta prescribir a la lengua y no describirla, la rae estuvo en contra del voseo (cómo nosotros usamos el ""vos"" y conjugamos), en contra del vocativo ""che"", en contra del yeísmo (cómo pronuncismos la ""y"" y la ""ll"" en el río de la plata), etc. Además de que hay mucha gente que usa a la rae como excusa para no darle pensamiento al por qué una cosa y no otra, como este caso, estar en contra del lenguaje inclusivo porque la rae dice que está mal

La verdad que no sé por qué estás intentando ridiculizar esto diciendo ""varies lingüistes"" e ""inclusive"" siendo que ya te dije que no me gusta el lenguaje inclusivo. Me parece que eso le saca un poco de fuerza a tu argumento",1601510518

I think its fair to say Tobias Harris (yea he's EXTREMELY overpaid, but) is a tier or two above Barnes as a player. He was also an awesome leader for our team, so I don't think he'd be a downgrade from that perspective. So for that part you're pretty much getting a first and a better player for a slightly worse player, in return for taking his salary on. 

&amp;#x200B;

As for Josh and Buddy, I think while their very different players they are on the same tier as players. Josh would give you a cheaper 3&amp;D player that might fit better and be less redundant assuming that you bring back Bogi.

I used to love AITA,  but I left after the mods gave me two bans. One was because I commented that the OP wasn't an AH, and that her &lt;Forget whoever it was, husband, SO, MIL, etc&gt; shouldn't have been so bitchy about &lt;whatever it was&gt;. The next time was over some boundary stomping person when the person was going through cancer treatment. I shared that when you are deep in treatment, it's ok to be angry and want to tell everyone to fuck off, especially if they're putting stress on the person's shoulders. Both bans were for being uncivil (for saying another person who wasn't he OP was being bitchy, and the second time for saying it's ok to tell people to fuck off). That last one hit me hard because it felt like some power tripping asshole whose worst moment was probably when a wedding guest only gave her a $50 gift card was saying that to me, a two time (three time now ☹️)cancer patient that I was not allowed to have felt the way I did. I even protested separately by DM and tried to explain exactly how horrific treatment can be, and that if they had never gone through it or seen someone they love go through it, then they probably had this false picture of the saintly cancer patient in movies who deals with everything with grace and holiness. I was just trying to share that it's hard enough going through it feeling like you are afraid to die (and then later being angry and afraid because you weren't allowed to die and that God must be some sick sadistic bstrd for taking others but making you keep going on when you just want it to be over but don't want to kill yourself) without having to also feel guilty for not being St Mary Mother Dying Theresa of the Family Gracious too. They said I was pushing close to a perm ban so I fucking left. Interestingly, in both cases the mod banning me was also someone who had commented the exact opposite of what I had said, meaning part of it was their being pissed about not getting 100% validation.

ETA: crap, just saw that in this case the mods may have been right. Ok, ok, but still, my point about power tripping mods whether in JNMiL, or AITA, or, there, or, everywhere...stands.",1601510519

"Mcat","t5_2saxp","I see you did all of the UEarth and AAMC questions. This is an impressive feat.. Along with 6 FL's!! Wow. 

How did you review the questions you did? 

Did you just answer the questions, or did you go back and review them after? If you did go back and review them, did you review all of the questions-- the ones you got right and the  ones you got wrong? Did you make Anki cards from the questions and review those cards daily? Did you go back and do content review for the questions you got wrong and really dive into why you got the question wrong? Did you keep a list of the errors you made to find patterns? Did you time yourself when you did questions? 

If you answered no to any of the questions above, you probably prioritized quantity over quantity. 

Plenty of people get high scores and don't make it through all of the UEarth, AAMC and 6 FLs. 

I think you need to do fewer problems and more review. The review is where the learning and score boosting happens. Also a sub 500 score means CR is your weakness-- especially if you are getting the discrete questions wrong. 

If you aren't able to self motivate, get a prep course.

We know he was apparently from Ypres, Belgium, spoke Flemish but was Spanish and immigrated to Canada on a boat called the  Numibian in 1903 with his wife and two kids. Again, would this just be get tests taken and hope for the best? I tried to look into records for that area but many of the sites I found were not in English and did not translate well.

So, when you go to the movies and your friend asks you how the new suspense film was, and you say, ""I was glued to my seat"" because some prankster put Krazy Glue on your seat, your friend will assume you mean this as the common figure of speech to mean ""rapt.""

2. If not for Josh in the final, Becky and Frank would be the only two alternatives.

3. Luca is a legend. Natasha has shown moments nastiness and arrogance. Clearly not deserving to be a MasterChef after refusing to give Jessie butter.

4. Elizabeth is arguably worse than Natasha in terms of attitude, because of her nasty and catty comments in the finale towards Courtney. While she was a probably better cook than Courtney, her comments were just unnecessarily mean.

5. Stephen is a great cook, but Derrick has the better techniques. Nonetheless, I would have loved to see them battle each other in the finale. However, Claudia really deserved the win, and Derrick was equally as deserving.

6. It could be a possibility. Terry could have definitely been in the finale over David.

7.  Cate was an incredible cook, and is quite possibly the strongest semifinalist in the show’s history, but Jason and Dino were light years ahead of everybody in that season.

8. Emily could have definitely won the season, if she wasn’t so cocky about sending Shanika home. However, I can’t say the same about Julia. While she was clearly better than the average in individual challenges, her true force came from team challenges. Gerron truly deserved the win.

9. Most of the Season 10 contestants are below Dorian. What about Jamie, Fred, Micah, Shari, Subha, Noah, Sarah, even Bri, and last but not least NICK!!!! They’ve shown more innovation and creativity in one of each of their dishes than Dorian ever put in all of her dishes.

Safi requires softening to have any weakpoints at all, Fatalis's head and chest are huge weakspots.    
Safi has great maneuverability and can jump hundreds of feet in a single bound.  
It can reproduce aseuxally and the dialogue from the NPCs indicate it could wipe out humanity and replace them as the dominant species if left unchecked (the Xeno in World is likely the offpsring of Safi in Iceborne, it's been confirmed they are 2 different individuals by Capcom and there are multiple cocoons in the Safi nest implying it has had babies).

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I see... The thing is, even without evidence, you should, in my opinion, talk about your suspicions with her even just because you're not confortable with the situation and those possibility can affect what she wants to do with her family.
The thing is I'm trying to put myself in her shoes and if my spouse has suspicions about someone, i don't need evidence, we should be able to talk even if i don't agree, i want to be able to see my spouse point of view and come to a decision together about what to do next.
The cousin's family, i give up, that's clear they won't want to admit anything about his behavior so you need to take a decision with your wife about what you're confortable doing, based on what you know and your suspicious.
I'm sorry OP, it's probably not the most helpful advise but for me, you need open communication with your partner and to agree on what to do together for your family, it could be cut contact, or try to establish semi contact like a half apology but not really whatever, what is important is that you and your wife are on the same path and that you agree that whatever decision is taken, it is based on your family's safety being the priority.
I really hope the situation will get better!!",1601510523

The timeline of Tayshia’s arrival lines up perfectly with the rumors about Clare cancelling dates, feeling conflicted, etc. If you take all of that away, I think the timing of her arrival seems so random. I really don’t think the producers would have been banking so hard on her leaving with Dale mid season unless they knew she was talking with him before filming. 

I stand by my opinion when the original Freaky Friday news broke that Clare became seriously locked in on Dale early. The producers realized they had a perfect situation to add drama, bring in a “more popular” lead and let Clare leave with her love story. 

If Tayshia truly was in play before filming started, I think that was more related to something like COVID.",1601510523

It makes me deeply uncomfortable to have people pray for me to be “healed” because they assume that I’m not perfectly fine with myself the way I am. I don’t want to be cured of my paralysis or my deafness and it’s insulting to have people assume my life can’t be as good or valuable because of those things.

Their walled garden creates a simple and refined interface because there is no use permitted outside of what they intend on you using their devices for and how they want you to use it. It is the difference between an open world game and a linear level narrative. You get less options and freedoms, but you do get a more polished experience.

I have tried or been forced to use iPhones or iPads and I found it very frustrating because you have to learn how to use an IOS product. They have simplified everything to the point that you can't just apply the same methods of use learned from windows or linux computers. I find myself needing to put forth more effort than is required because the shortcuts are so foreign and different than what I have grown up with in windows, linux, and android. I kept closing out an app by pressing the home button and then having to relaunch the app or having to launch an app via an icon instead of pulling up historic apps idling in the background because the simplified method used is not as obvious as hitting the button for historic apps that is always there like android has. They have made it too simple and easy for me, as counterintuitive as that is.

Once you hit level 20, your character stops gaining exp and stats, but you character isn’t maxed yet, you’ll need the potions that drop from enemies in godlands and dungeon bosses. You’ve likely come across a few by now. Each potion gives +1 to a stat (or +5 mana/hp) and each class has different maximum stats. 

Your main goal as a new player is to last as long as you can on your characters so you can learn boss patterns and dungeons, while slowly acquiring and drinking pots to max out your character.

When you get pretty good at the game (or use max candies) you might eventually get an 8/8 character. This mean 8 out of 8 stats are maxed. With an 8/8 character, you can start earning permanent (small) stat bonuses by clearing end game dungeons.",1601510525

I think this is one important thing. Lue is more YOLO with his job and not as nice/positive as Doc. I can imagine Doc never calling out his guys hard but preferring to go with giving positive messages and supportive speeches even when in a pinch.

Lue will call out his guy even if it'll cost him his job in the end because it's widely known he did it to Lebron during that 2016 finals G7 half time and Bron got pissed AF at him. You can't ALWAYS play that card and it doesn't work on every guy, but at least you know Ty Lue has done it to Bron. LAC looked like a team that needed a bit of that anger/fire motivation the way they got bounced this year.

&gt;Ty Lue is a marginal improvement at best.

Got to agree with this point too. I don't think Ty is better than Doc. Some things he's better and other things not so much. 

But Doc's firing has less to do with his coaching and more with his extended record, how badly the team failed expectations, and small window w/ necessity to mix things up. LAC doesn't have tons of options. Easiest one is to fire the coach.",1601510526

I know a few OkiJETs (mostly outer islanders) here who take the bus or walk to their base and/or visiting schools, but it's more productive to have a car in my opinion. We don't have a train system except for a monorail running in the capital city and the southern part of the city right above it. All the times I've taken the bus, the bus has always been late because traffic is horrible during rush hour. 

I know I am someone who likes to be out and about and explore, so getting a car became somewhat of a priority for me after saving a few paychecks, and got one in my third month of living here. It's nice to have that extra freedom especially since I don't have to rely on trying to find a ride from someone to mandatory work events.",1601510526

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","# Section 2: [Attack](https://bit.ly/3cU4gwh)

With preparations complete Arthur and Guy are ready to commence their assault. Arthur will knight 9 of the smoke bombs in their possession and order them to surround UE. Ideally the pair will be together but if not then they can just split up to surround both. If the UE members are too far apart for Arthur’s subjects to be able to reach both then that means they aren’t close enough to help each other so Arthur and Guy will gang up on whichever is closest, preferably Medea. Once the smoke bombs have surrounded UE Arthur will command them to detonate which will surround UE in smoke but **not** cover them. This is important because Arthur and Guy can sneakily approach in the smoke while still being able to see their targets through the crystal ball that Guy left on the south west pillar. After detonation, Madrigal will deknight the smoke bombs. If Medea and Rob are separate, the same maneuver will be employed, just with smoke bombs split between the two-5 for Medea, 4 for Rob.

As our forces begin to rush in, Arthur and Guy piggybacked by Lancelot and Percival, Mordred will grab two more tier 2 items, a fire extinguisher and another net gun (this is only needed if the previous net gun has already been used) which Arthur will knight the net for. To start off the ambush Mordred will fire off a knighted net at BoB in an attempt to A POW crush the fragile yet powerful stand (keep in mind that Mordred will know exactly where BoB is at due to the crystal ball from earlier). The net will aim to restrain by wrapping around BoB’s midsection and constricting with all its might-basically the equivalent of getting crushed by a trash compactor. Not only will this severely damage BoB, all the damage caused will transfer back to Rob. At best he’ll be dealing with shattered ribs and crushed lungs, barely able to breathe in and out, if not an outright RETIREment. While they deal with the sudden projectile the other four will spring from the smoke. Arthur and Lancelot will attack Medea while Guy and Percival will attack Rob.

Medea is scary for one big reason-her high physicals compounding her martial arts stat. Arthur’s plan of attack aims to cut her feet out from under her in this regard.

Lancelot will engage in direct CQC, while Arthur stays back to provide support. Lancelot is the perfect opponent for Medea for two reasons. First of all, his speed and strength are respectively on par with hers, and exceed hers two-to-one. Second of all, his mannequin body renders her strikes mostly ineffective. Medea will have to break through a layer of armour before she can even damage him, and even then, a few fist-sized holes mean little to a chadly mannequin. In contrast, each time Lancelot hits Medea, it’ll mean broken bones, blood loss and severe internal damage. 

As the fight begins, Lancelot will forcibly grab onto Medea’s face, yanking off any mask she’s wearing. He’ll then unleash a merciless, two-handed beatdown, smacking the shit out of her with endless aplomb. Arthur will stay back, attacking with Madrigal at any openings and using footwork from his Swordsmanship to stay out of range of any counterattacks. Arthur’s physicals may seem underwhelming, but with Madrigal in his hands, he’s a beast. He’s a superhumanly skilled swordsman with a sword that can slice through anything. His slashes are going to hit, and when they do, they stand a chance of literally cutting Medea in half. 

Arthur’s sword also gives him a major reach advantage, and makes it impossible for Medea or DB to approach him safely-if they do so, they end up putting themselves within slashing distance before they’re close enough to actually punch. Speaking of DB, it’s likely to be fighting next to Medea. If it focuses on Lancelot, he’ll tank any attacks it unleashes, while Arthur stands back, slashing and stabbing at them both. If it turns towards Arthur, he’ll simply dance backwards to slightly outside of it’s E RNG, and slash away at it like a pinata from slightly outside of punching range. It may have B SPD, but it’s limited range of movement, and Arthur’s emphasis on skill and precision in his Swordsmanship skill, means it’s likely to eat a few mean slashes.

Guy will face Rob with some extreme caution. He’ll engage the moment the net lands on BoB, aiming to win decisively while the Stand is out of play. Percival will leap into Rob, tackling him to the ground, and Guy will unload with his two swords. The Knighted Masu will wrap itself around Rob, aiming to restrain him with A POW while it’s tip flails around, causing as much damage as possible. Guy benefits from VQ’s A PRE and Anatomy 5 when wielding his swords, and will aim every slash with Bangalter to slice open a vital blood vessel or slash a tendon clean through. A few good cuts should not only immobilize Rob, but leave him dead after a few minutes. All the while, Percival will unload blow after A POW blow into Rob’s body, aiming for the head to keep him disoriented and unable to respond.

In the meanwhile, while BoB is netted, Mordred will focus the tar paintballs on it, properly gunking it up and creating an extra hazard due to the incredibly flammable nature of [tar](https://bit.ly/2HJZRAq). When BoB looks likely to snap the ropes, Percival will leave Rob to Guy, and leap onto the Stand with all the aplomb A POW legs can muster. Before BoB fully breaks free, Percival will attempt to seal the deal by leaping straight at it and unloading all the destruction it can muster. Compounding the damage from the rope and from Guy’s early onslaught should put such a low-durability duo out of commission.

If constraining Rob is not possible then Guy will focus on fighting Rob while Percival keeps BoB busy. In particular, Guy will use his now A POW Masu to cut through Rob's chain and rush him down as Percival valiantly sacrifices itself to give Guy the time he needs to turn Rob into fresh sashimi. All the while Guy will have his steel chair shield ready to block any surprise attack such as BoB spitting molten marbles. Mordred will also be on standby to spray down either Guy or Percival with the fire extinguisher if they end up subject to BoB’s attack.

If such a situation arises where both Lancelot and Percival have been destroyed and UE has not been sufficiently retired then Athur will begin to recruit whatever he can get his hands on. If they are fighting next to a tier 3 spawner then Arthur will knight the blanket he finds there and order it to constrain Medea, similarly to the net gun. At best this is another A POW, rib crushing, immobilizing wrap and at worst it is an effective distraction to create an opening for Arthur to finish his fight. If they are fighting next to a tier 2 spawner Arthur will knight the skateboard he finds there and order it to use hit and run tactics to target Medea’s ankles making it difficult for her to stand giving Arthur an advantage. Once Medea is dealt with Arthur and his new subjects will rush to Guy’s aid.",1601510529

I knocked a container of the base solution onto the table. It almost hit my classmate's arm. I just soaked it up with paper towels and hoped the teacher didn't see it, but she probably did.

Another time we were doing a thing with zinc tablets, an experiment to measure density I think. The teacher was very clear that we should be careful when emptying the containers with the tablets because zinc is relatively expensive and since we were just putting it in water we could reuse it.

After we finished, a guy in my group said he was going to empty the container. I said ""sure, go ahead"" and he goes towards the sink. Around two seconds later I think ""wait, why did he go to the sink?"" and turn around to see him just pouring the water and zinc tablets into the sink.

At the 2001 GOTJ in Toledo, my buddy and I were wandering around the convention center and saw the line for the ""Mystery Seminar"".  Compared to other lines we had stood in, this one was fairly short as a lot of people didn't want to stand for hours and be let down is what I gathered from others in the line.

It's been 19 years ago so I can't remember how long the wait was but I don't remember it being that long.  The doors were opened and we all gathered in and grabbed our seats.  I remember it being a small room so I don't think there could have been more than 50 people in there.

Suddenly the lights were dimmed and Jumpsteady (if I remember correctly) welcomed us and told us no cameras or video cameras were allowed AT ALL!  A figure walked down the middle of the aisle with his head under a white towel and approached the podium.  The towel was removed and it was Violent J with NO PAINT!!  I realize in todays era, that isn't a huge deal but back then that was unheard of.

He proceeded to tell stories and if I remember correctly we were shown home movies of J and Shaggz from back in the day.  Later in the seminar, Shaggz joined the seminar and told some stories as well.  After the seminar; I approached Jumpsteady and had him sign my program and chatted him up a bit.

People have this idea of abuse as something highly visible, you hear/see your neighbor kicking the shit out of his wife, she’s always hiding black eyes and broken limbs, etc.

Those cases are no less real, but it’s often so much quieter, so much less visible. 

Most abuse happens entirely behind closed doors and without easily visible injuries. 

You can see that he denigrated Shannan by the way she always talks about him “tolerating” her and how “lucky” she was that he “put up with her”, so many little comments like that were taken by the media as her being some kind of unstable nightmare of a woman.

But as a woman that was abused, I did that **all the time**. I constantly told people how lucky I was, how he was so patient, how I didn’t deserve him. *Because he always instilled in me that I wasn’t good enough and that I wasn’t worthy or desirable or lovable.* 
When your abuser makes you feel worthless every day, you become desperate for affection, love, praise, appreciation, any shred of the notion that you’re *enough*. 

Shannan was one of the many silent victims of abuse that instead of fighting her abuser and outing them and leaving, begged, pleaded and did everything in her power to be “enough” again..

And for that, he slaughtered her, her unborn son, and her beautiful and completely innocent little girls.",1601510530

3. Once employed invest systematically every month.  Put some money away $30?  $130?  More if  you have it available....

"rust","t5_2s7lj","&gt; I was thinking that I could have a memory handling thread essentially caching ahead and dropping data that was no longer currently necessary for calculation ... However, I think I might have had my mistake pointed out to me. I've been handling the data as a monolithic structure which, for smaller versions of the problem, was perfectly adequate. However, now I'm trying to tackle these larger problems, I think a better approach would be to box things and store the references as the monolith.

Yeah, using boxes to manage what chunks of your data exist seems like a safe, straightforward way of accomplishing that dropping. It has some overhead (extra RAM due to the pointers, extra CPU due to chasing the pointers) but if the chunks are sufficiently large that overhead is negligible.

Another way of managing the dropping would be to have the one contiguous memory mapping, then (as valarauca14 said) call `madvise(..., MADV_DONTNEED)` or `madvise(..., MADV_FREE)` on pages when all their chunks are depopulated. But if you can just make a chunk a whole page or larger, the box way probably has negligible overhead. If not, one still-needed chunk on a page will force that page to stay resident. Either way the one mapping method doesn't seem clearly better and requires dealing with unsafe APIs. You'd basically be writing a specialized memory allocator that maybe has a bitmask to track the state of a chunk and hands out immutable references to populated chunks or mutable references to the thing populating a chunk. With threading that might get quite complex to manage correctly and efficiently. I'd avoid this.

Yet another way is to just have the one mapping and rely on the OS to page out the stuff you're not using. It sounds like you've already tried this and had bad luck. I think your ""linux is killing it"" means the OOM-killer ran? If you use a file-backed mapping or give it enough swap, I'd think the OOM killer would stop doing that. But I bet your program will run slowly this way, especially if your backing store (file or swap) is on spinning disk rather than SSD. You probably are better able than the kernel to predict which pages you'll need later, and discarding pages you know you won't need is cheaper than paging them out. It may be cheaper even if you actually do need them again later...recalculating is likely to be cheaper than a pair of disk seeks.",1601510532

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","I started working for an airline in 1970, when the B707 was the main jet used for international travel. My first flight was a real ""shock"", seeing how long it was inside, compared to our training in a mockup &amp; full of passengers. As it was my first trip (to HKG &amp; Kai Tak airport), I was invited to sit on flight deck for landing &amp; to a novice, it looked like it was going to be my last flight as we appeared to be flying into the hill around one end of the airport as we negotiated ""the checkerboard"" to land. It was exciting though, looking into peoples homes, through their open windows as they watched TV as we did the U-turn to lineup with runway.

Enter the B747 and that was also a shock to see the size compared to the ""baby"" 707, but what a great aircraft it  was &amp; was around for the rest of my days with the airline, although it was a lot more work for us. The introduction of the B767 was to become my favourite as it flew the routes I most enjoyed especially to one country, where I now live in retirement.

Back in the early days, all classes were served meals on ceramics &amp; stainless steel cutlery with glass rather than plastic for drinks. Seats were far enough apart others in the row didn't have to get out to let window seated people into. Movies we on a larger screen on the front of each section &amp; plastic headsets were used, unlike the new electronic entertainment. We carried all sorts of amenities to give away - playing cards, kids colouring books with pencils rather than crayons, paperback books, magazines &amp; newspapers were available, lapel pins, sockettes, diapers etc.

To start with drinks were in miniatures &amp; paid for (USD0.35 for spirits/liqueurs &amp; 0.18c for beer or a packet of 20 cigarettes, free sodas)., but soon after it was found it was cheaper to use large bottles of spirits &amp; give the drinks away which gave the crew the opportunity to give bottles away to ""special"" passengers.

I am glad to be out of the industry, especially now with covid causing loss of jobs, as more passengers crammed into the same space, smaller seats &amp; leg room, longer flights, less crew to do the work, and all the restrictions that have come into effect since 9/11. I had a great 23 years during my time &amp; in the 30 years since I left, I have only taken 3 flights which I didn't enjoy (probably would have been happier if I had been working rather than cramped sitting in my seat).",1601510533

"CombatFootage","t5_2v0c6","&gt; The conflict also saw 235,000 Armenian refugees flee other parts of Azerbaijan, including from Nakhichevan, an exclave of Azerbaijan tucked between Armenia and Turkey.

From the same source. 

&gt; According to statistics published by the Imperial Russian government in 1916, Armenians made up 40% of the population of the Nakhchivan uyezd. The borders of the uyezd were redrawn and in the 1926 all-Soviet census 11% of region's population was Armenian. By 1979 this number had shrunk to 1.4%. The Azerbaijani population, meanwhile increased substantially with both a higher birth rate and immigration (growing from 85% in 1926 to 96% by 1979). The Armenian population saw a great reduction in their numbers throughout the years repatriating to Armenia and elsewhere.

Now it's 0%. All of them were forced out. 

&gt; By the beginning of January 1990, only 50,000 Armenians remained in Baku compared to a quarter million in 1988; most of these left after being targeted in a pogrom that occurred prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the early stages of the Nagorno-Karabakh War.

All of them were forced out after massacres. 

&gt; The city of Sumgait is located near the coast of the Caspian Sea, only thirty kilometers north of the capital Baku. It had been renovated in the 1960s and had become a leading industrial city, second after Baku by its industrial importance, with oil refineries and petrochemical plants built during that era. Its population in the 1960s stood at 60,000, but by the late 1980s it had swollen to over 223,000 (with an Armenian population of about 17,000), and overcrowding among other social problems plagued the city. 

All of them were forced out after massacres.

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","I'm a little late and a little long, but I kind of intervened about five years ago. TL/DR below. Here goes.

I'm a mandatory child abuse reporter, meaning I have a state license that can be yanked if I don't report. One day Someone at work told me about unusual bruises they'd seen on a Co-worker's child. Co-worker was a shy, quiet type and well liked among their peers. Someone asked Co-worker about the bruises and Co-worker said they didn't know how the child got them. Someone was concerned, and I thanked them for telling me about it.

I couldn't get the bruises off my mind. Co-worker was such a private person, though, I told myself there must have been an innocent explanation for the bruises. Maybe Co-worker knew how the child was injured and thought it was none of Someone's business. Except I couldn't think of an innocent way to explain the bruises. And Someone told me they heard that the same child had broken a bone a few months earlier. 

So I called the hotline for mandatory reporters and told them what I knew. I felt better knowing I'd called and it was off my shoulders. 

A few months later I found out Co-worker's Spouse had been charged with multiple felonies involving child abuse and neglect. A detective told me Spouse had confessed to the crimes on video. I was subpoenaed for trial, but Spouse agreed to a plea bargain that included anger management training.

Co-worker eventually found out that Someone and I were involved and told us it was all a misunderstanding. I don't work there any more, but I heard the kid got 86'd from daycare because of behavior issues. It wasn't the most satisfying outcome, but I'm glad I reported the abuse. I would do it again.

TL/DR: Five years ago I heard secondhand that a co-worker's baby had a black eye and two broken bones. I was required by law to report it. Cops caught the abuser, who confessed and took a plea deal.

"weed","t5_2qhpc","I am a bit older than you, and I haven't smoked for as long as you have because I didn't smoke when I was a teenager, but I 've had concerns similar to yours.

I started smoking on a daily basis and for some time I everything was going great. The people around me started to like me even more because I reached a point in which I was feeling pretty zen with life. I started to have a more conciliatory attitude towards people and I experienced an increased creativity at work. However, a few months ago I began feeling a bit disconnected from reallity, in the sense that for example I stopped following the news, and I partially lost some interest in social life. I entered in a depression and I didn't (and still haven't) told my therapist about my smoking habit. I saw another red flag when my boyfriend told me how passive my attitude was when I smoked. Fortunately, weed is not extremely addictive, so I managed to stop smoking and I haven't smoked in the past three months.


For now, I don't say to myself I've quitted because I still feel that weed helps me a lot, but on the other hand I can see how it prevents me from putting more effort in doing all kinds of things. I'm not sure if the dilemma is caused because weed truly brings good things to my life, or if it's due to dependence on the substance.

My advice is: stop smoking for some time. You might feel anxiety for three or four days, but after that it's easy to handle. Take it as an experiment. You can go back to smoking later if you wish.",1601510537

"ShitpostXIV","t5_3lacy","Moderator: Viceroy Galvus, what is your plan to eliminate the summoning of eikons in Eorzea? 

Zenos: Eikons? One of my best friends is an Eikon. Shinryu. Truly tremendous guy. So powerful, honestly, you've gotta admire a guy like him. He even let me go inside him one time. 

Now look at the Warrior of Light over there, who've they got? What's on your list? What eikons support *you*, huh? Yeah exactly you're not even brave enough to say the words ""summoning prevention"" because if you did you'd lose all your Radical Monetarist supporters over in Ul'dah. 

That city-state is garbage, by the way. The refugees from Ala Mhigo went over there and started spreading Fake News about how we were doing for their nation. No one else in the realm has done as good as we have for Ala Mhigo. The people there, they love us, just ask them. Crime rate is down, employment is up, and the snake ladies aren't even thinking about summoning an eikon. And what has the Warrior of Light done for Ala Mhigo? Nothing, they haven't done anything, and they can't do anything, because if they did they'd rile up all of the Radical Eorzean Alliance.

The only guy who even really liked the Warrior of Light is Haurchefant, and that guy was a sucker and a loser and everyone knows it!

"QAnonCasualties","t5_1g87gi","Couple of things that might help:  

1) If you think of humanity like a bell curve standard distribution, you're always going to have outliers. Always. There will always be flat-earthers, conspiracy theorists, conspiracy documentarians ('cause let's face it, 9/11 was an inside job), and people who believe in just about anything.  That's human nature.  Just allow for craziness to exist, contain it, don't try to intervene.  Living in New York City or San Francisco definitely helps with this. 

2) Qultists want you to believe they're larger and more influential  than they are.  Q gives lost, forgotten and angry souls an identity and a purpose.  But they're like Blue VW Beetles - once you have it in mind, you see 'em everywhere.  But they're still a tiny number of all cars. 

3) it's still and will likely remain a tiny subculture.  Jim Watkins, the supposed ""Man Behind Q"" only gets a few hundred views on his vlogs.  Certainly the flout-ists/amplifiers/grifters who are pushing the Q narrative (And their associated Q merchandise and Patreon solicitations) get more traction because they're like mini Rush Limbaughs or Howard Sterns - shockjocks of YouTube who get traction by saying outrageous and unsubstantiated things.

4) The Qult goes through a lot of churn.  I know a lot of people. myself included, who bought into Q initially, but over time it loses its appeal and more importantly, its significance as a source of information.  Because if you keep digging you start to see inconsistencies, etc..

5) Some will still follow the Qult.  Just like there are people who believe Jesus is a white dude with blue eyes.  

And finally and sadly, this reminder from George Carlin, apropos: ""Think of the average person and how stupid they are. Now realize that half of them are stupider than that.""

We have removed this post as it is not suited to the /r/Python subreddit proper, however it should be very appropriate for our sister subreddit /r/LearnPython or for the r/Python discord: https://discord.gg/python.

The reason for the removal is that /r/Python is dedicated to discussion of Python news, projects, uses and debates. It is not designed to act as Q&amp;A or FAQ board. The regular community is not a fan of ""how do I..."" questions, so you will not get the best responses over here.

On /r/LearnPython the community and the r/Python discord are actively expecting questions and are looking to help. You can expect far more understanding, encouraging and insightful responses over there. **No matter what level of question you have, if you are looking for help with Python, you should get good answers**. Make sure to check out the rules for both places.

Warm regards, and best of luck with your Pythoneering!

At this point i should have thought to myself"" Give it up, if even this site dont have it i wont find it anywhere"", but i being a dumbfuck proceds to track down a chinese site where it can indeed be read up to chapter 185 and beyond, but it was paid content. At the time i thought i would be able to google translate everything once i bought the chapters, and i paid 10 dollars to buy about 200 chapters. And after i paid i discover i couldnt google translate the chapters beyond 185, neither could i copy and paste them. I guess its the way the website uses to prevent the stealing of the content but i felt so stupid for doing it that i now hate this novel to death",1601510540

"tifu","t5_2to41","Dude, that's a pretty big TIFU. I have experienced something very similar here where I live (Brazil). In my elementary school years, my school were placed next to some abandoned buildings, which some day, got infested with Phoneutria's Armed Spiders (called armadeiras here) which are just as poisonous as black widows (some say that armed spiders are the deadliest spiders in the world, because they are aggressive. Fun fact: a bite from armed spiders can cause an massive erection on human males! lol). So it was pretty common to find spiders in our desks. It was just like a nightmare....

ALERT! People with Arachnophobia, please don't watch the video below

Here is some footage which shows she's getting ""aggressive and armed"" (Chill, there's no jumpscare)

I know the general rule. The idea here is that your belt is very distant from your shoes, but creates actual contrast at your waist. I'm still going to match my belt to my shoes, and still going to avoid pants that require belts, but I do consider that contrast if I wear one.

Your pocket square should absolutely not match your tie. It *can* match your shirt color, that's an easy approach, but it's not a rule. Not sure what you're implying the difference is between a pocket square and a handkerchief, but it's generally size and function, not material or color.

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","\&gt;  T: (as he is walking away) Not my problem, take it to court. 

Irrespective of whether he's being dishonest about the tickets, this is a true statement.  It is not a requirement that the officer satisfy you as to the legitimacy of the charges.  Sure, he's being an asshole and you maybe didn't deserve that kind of treatment, but he cited you and that's that.  You'll pay the bail and/or show up to court and fight it -- THAT is where the state must show that the charges were  justified.

I understand how frustrating and unnerving this kind of thing is, but there's no upside for you in contesting this at the roadside.  All you can really do is make sure the officer hates you enough to make certain to be at court on the day in question.

My strategy, offered for consideration, is that you want to be as *forgettable* as possible.  It may not translate to the officer having trouble recalling details, and may not even do any good at all.  But getting in the guy's face \*is\* going to make him more likely to remember you.

Here's another question for you to ponder and for any Christians to answer: if Hell is, as some commenters suggest, just being separated from God, why all the fire and torture? Aren't non-believers already separated from God? Wouldn't an eternity without God just be living forever on earth as you are now? 

One counter to the above might be to argue that an eternity without God is an eternity without enjoying his creation, but he also made fire and darkness, didn't he? And Genesis 1:2 (""...darkness was over the surface of the deep..."") can't be literal because nothing can precede God. So it seems impossible that Hell is an eternity without God.

"StardustCrusaders","t5_2tny5","# Section 3: [Crimean Army Sortie](https://bit.ly/3l0p3AN)

Be aware that we would prefer to end the fight in the previous section. Section 3 will only happen if Arthur and Guy are forced to retreat from their CQC.

If Medea and Rob survive the earlier onslaught, they’ll have sustained pretty significant damage. Guy and Arthur will [coolly withdraw] if the battle starts to turn against them, preparing to lick their wounds and finish things. Guy and Arthur have a major advantage, in that any damage they sustain can be healed, provided adequate time. They’ll move to item acquisition points, each aiming to collect either a stepladder or chair for himself. Arthur will knight these items, letting them bound around at C SPD as he or Guy rides on top. They’ll use these items to kite around the battered enemy duo as Guy retrieves his hidden brain and uses his natural regeneration to heal their wounds. Once their healing is finished, 

Any surviving mannequins will run along the mounted Guy and Arthur. Their goal will be to stay outside of BoB’s 20 M range, unless entering it is necessary, while still harassing from a distance. If Medea or Rob end up putting on masks, Guy will fire a knighted tar ball at their faces with A PRE, which will go on to rip the mask off of their face and tear it to shreds. If the two try to hide under the stage, Arthur will Knight sections of it key to its structural integrity, and have them rip themselves away, bringing it crashing down on top of them.

Arthur and Guy will maintain distance, playing around any standing brick pillars, so they can dodge behind them at the sight of incoming projectiles, and so they can recover the two keystones of their final plan - the magnet gun and the firework launcher. Once they have the magnet gun in their possession, Guy and Arthur will travel across the stage, acquiring and knighting as many metal or partially-metal items as possible-fire extinguishers, skateboards, stepladders, steel chairs, you name it.  The gaggle of these will follow the two around until there’s 12 knighted subjects, including Guy and Arthur’s steeds.

Once this number is reached, all the subjects, excepting Guy and Arthur’s steeds, will charge towards Rob. The second they reach a 10-meter distance, Guy will yank on the magnet gun’s trigger, firing them all, with A PRE, straight into Rob’s stupid face. The 10-man gank squad will waste no time getting to work. The collision should’ve knocked the already-wounded Rob off of his feet, and each subject will waste no time in getting to blastin’. They’ll slam themselves into him with all the might that C POW can muster, and within a few seconds, Rob Zombie will be...no more. BoB’s interference means little-there’s not much chance the Stand can destroy all 10 subjects before it’s master succumbs, and heating them up will just kill him faster.

This just leaves Medea. She’s likely in a poor physical state from her earlier beating, while all the time we spent kiting around means that VQ has had a chance to work it’s magic. Any surviving subjects will converge on her, and Guy will blast away at her from a distance with tar balls, and then retrieve his coup de grace - the glorious firework launcher. He’ll blast every available firework at her, and if even one connects, every drop of tar on her will burst into flames. To help, Arthur will retrieve any random items he can, knighting them and sending them to finish her off. With the war of attrition won, Suburban Regalia turned to collect their prize.

[“I can't believe you would give us a bigger target. Did you think that size would increase your chance of winning?”](https://bit.ly/3mZAmuW) Guy laughs with a smirk as the crowd cheers.

# Contingencies: [Bramble Blast](https://bit.ly/3cPb8uD)

**What if they camp a tower and attempt to pelt us from above?** Arthur will throw a smoke bomb up at the tower and detonate it to obscure their vision. Then Arthur will command Lancelot and Percival to hop up and momentarily distract Rob and Medea. While they are distracted, Arthur and Guy will each go to a side of the pillar and slice through it with their A POW blades toppling the tower while Lancelot and Percival retreat. 

**What if they try attacking us from below using their own crystal ball?** In this scenario Arthur will throw smoke bombs into the air detonating them to make sure the enemies can't tell their position from the crystal ball. Then Guy and Arthur using the eye drones beneath the stage to tell them precisely where UE are will proceed to stab through the ground with their swords and impale the enemies. 

**What if Rob has his own mask during CQC?** All that needs to be done is Masu will slash off the mask as it wraps around Rob’s body, allowing the plan to continue smoothly.

**What if BoB has created some lava pits around the arena?** Arthur and Guy will be careful to not be idiots and accidentally fall in. End of story.

**What if we get rushed down?**:First of all, Arthur and Guy ride on top of C SPD subjects for most of the strat, so they’re really only threatened by rushdown from Medea or BoB. If BoB rushes them down, they’ll leave any excess subjects to beat it’s ass and slow it down, and kite outside of it’s range. If Medea closes the gap, they’ll try the same thing, only Arthur will try and get a few swipes in with Madrigal if he can. 

**What if Arthur or Guy are hit with venom?** Medea’s sheet specifically states that the spitting cobra has a knack for aiming for the eyes. Thankfully eyes are very light and Guy can make new eyes for himself or Arthur in mere seconds. This is done through Guy throwing a mass of flesh at Arthur’s head and it fixing/creating a new eye for him.

**What if Arthur is critically injured and Guy is busy?** Arthur will alert Guy and will apply Guy’s spleen which he received at the beginning of the match to the wounded area which VQ can heal.",1601510542

The facility definitely won’t know your costs after insurance and will most likely just quote you the flat 20%. they can’t tell you the direct cost for the surgeon and anesthesiologist bc they charge per hour, which could vary based on the surgery. I think it’s fair to ask the hourly rate for each and estimate.

Also! Some plastic surgery offices offer “Care Credit” which is a loan  that’s interest free if you pay it back after 6 months. Perhaps you could finance your portion of the surgery this way? That way you have longer to pay it off! 

Think about this as an investment in yourself and an avoidance of lost future income. For myself, I’m considering the fact about three nights a week I have a tension migraine and lay in bed. If I can eliminate that I could even get an additional part time job and help pay off my surgery. And then after it’s paid off! I have the rest of my life to live pain free.

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","&gt; Being messy is an awful trait and can be very revealing of one's personality and deeper subconscious, but the question isn't even asking if you're okay with someone who is ""messy"", it's asking if you're okay dating someone who was ""really messy"".

Subjective. Your assumption isn't shared by everyone. Most people would likely describe themselves as, at minimum, occasionally somewhat messy.

&gt; The jealousy question is another one where how the question is worded could change how one would answer. If it were simply worded as ""Is it natural to feel jealousy in a relationship?"" I could see a lot of people answering ""yes"". But this question is asking if jealousy is ""healthy"". It certainly is natural for humans to feel jealousy, but it is definitely not healthy and if it is not handled well it will almost certainly be what ends the relationship.

Same as above. It's subjective. Many people believe jealousy can be healthy, and the question doesn't indicate about how it is handled.

What I am trying to say is that being a doctor in america allows you to live above all that shit. Also, medicine is like a marriage for life, so you shouldn't only think like your actual self but also as your long term future self. In 10, 20 or whatever years you will maybe have a family and so and the salary you will get in america will allow you provide absolutely top conditions not only for yourself but also for those around you. Being poor in america sucks balls but while being rich, america is unrivalled in terms of what it can give you.

He was an unpleasant professor who made Harry’s life more difficult at times, and he’s *also* the man who sacrificed so much of his own life in order to defeat a great evil. *Thats* what Harry is choosing to focus on. Harry is demonstrating his maturity and capacity for forgiveness, which fits the theme of the series perfectly. Love each other, forgive past grievances, all that jazz.

China actually already have high performance (MiG-21) drones, I wonder if they have tried to use them more than as target practice and how expensive if would be to mass produce old MiGs as drones.

Just wait for a few weeks until the hotness dies down and we can talk then. Genshin is more of a PC game anyway since seeing from the grossing charts, its actually really low ranked on mobile devices (I was expecting it to be top 10 at the very least especially on launch week) for a game of its caliber.

&amp;#x200B;

In previous games I have used double mawloc to just shut down the beasts.  It takes a unit of beasts absolutely forever to chew down a single mawloc once you get them in combat, as they are wounding on rerollable 5s and then have no ap so I get 3+ saves.  It might take a unit of beasts 4 fight phases to get through a single monster.  When two mawlocs can hold up 10 beasts your opponent doesn't have much of a chance.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","That is a very reductive understanding of a very complex issue, and it is a complex issue as anyone who has studied abortion decision making can attest. Reproductive coercion does not play into your ""model"" of abortion decision making, neither does the reality of self-induced abortions in countries where it is completely legal due to lack of access and knowledge. No decision is made in a bubble, we look at external factors- policies and programs- because they affect whether a woman seeks an abortion and we use inferential statistics to measure the effect. 

It's easy to say ""well just change your position and you can get funding"", but the reality is to do that is to condemn countless women to die from unsafe abortions and complications. Again, we're not talking about people with access to a developed health infrastructure where they can call for an ambulance staffed with individuals trained in triage while they are transported to an Emergency Department where they'll be seen by a physician and do not fear being reported for having had an abortion. We're talking about places where women absolutely risk their lives for abortions even knowing they are dangerous and illegal. The reality is they're sick of seeing young women die or develop serious complications from unsafe procedures because abortions are criminalized or there is no access to them even where it is illegal. The argument ""it is necessary to save lives"" is absolutely true, and faced with that reality you have to take steps to save the life of the mother.",1601510544

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","I don’t think it comes down to the severity of the obstacle, but the source of the obstacle. I don’t think I articulated what I was trying to say too well in my first comment so let me try to clarify:

An obstacle to freedom that is enforced legally comes from a source that is both capable and willing to enforce such obstacle 10/10 times. Some obstacles to freedom like laws that give the government the authority to put someone in jail for possession of marijuana are very controversial. Laws like this are not valued by everyone, yet an individual who sees nothing wrong with smoking marijuana every night before bed is still bound by this law. this may be one example of a case where governmental authority is seen as a major hindrance to freedom for reasons that many people do not support or find compelling.

An obstacle such as poor health is not inflicted by any organization or authority similar to the government. It’s the unfortunate result of many factors that include genetics and things out of our control. 

It is compatible to support both positions, that (1) Government restricts freedom when it often shouldn’t and (2) Its unfortunate that any individual may suffer from poor health and the restrictions to freedom that it renders.

I think we would be hard pressed to find someone who disagrees with either of those statements. What is more likely is that there will be disagreement over what the solution to the problem raised in (2) is. Some support universal healthcare because it may remedy many of the cases where poor health hinders freedom. Others may argue that a free market solution to healthcare is more effective and/or that universal healthcare hinders other kinds of freedoms, notably from the medical professionals who would be providing such care. 

Not really taking a stance here, I just think this latter conversation is the more prevalent debate you are getting at. Basically, if we take your premise that through policy we can eradicate hinderances to freedom caused by the government and by poor health, then it comes down to what policy prescription would do it best. This is a divisive conversation for many and countries like America where I’m from are very far from reaching national agreement.",1601510545

Well, that's the thing; due to the fact that I know there really won't be much of a tonal difference (at least for me) between high end guitars and decent Fenders or Squiers; I wanna go more with the one I visually like the most; which is the CV.  
I already tried it on my local guitar shop and even tho they were pretty much similar guitar, the playing felt much more comfortable on the CV and the color is just KILLER!   
Thanks! I'm still thinking really hard on what to ask for; I even considered asking for a Gretsch G5622T-CB Electromatic cuz I think it's a gorgeous semihollow, but like... I just don't know what to do. Cuzzz I also don't eanna buy something I don't deserve... Like, I don't think I have the skill to deserve an American Original or stuff like that...   


About the amp, yeah I looked for the best Fender amps I could find here and that one is the best price/quality wise speaking. And like, I fell like if I get gear I like; I'll want to play it more and more.  


Yeah, you're totally right! I think for now I'll go for the amp and if possible the guitar, if not I'll just stay with the amp and save for a better guitar in the future!

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","&gt;Não há a mínima comparação com o momento atual.

Certamente que não. O momento econômico mundial é outro. Até a comparação do gráfico é tendenciosa.


&gt;Pesquisa que custava uma merreca para o governo. Não há justificativa para cortar.

Multiplica por umas 50 áreas de pesquisa em 1000 universidades. Não existe isso de ""custa uma merreca, não vale a pena cortar"". Dinheiro público tem que ser bem gasto. Ponto. Sua afirmação só vale pro primeiro escalão de amigos do rei. Eu, funcionário público, se gastar mal R$ 10, tenho que dar conta. 


&gt;Sim, o Ernesto Araújo é a mesma coisa que o Celso Amorim! (só pra citar um exemplo gritante) - sem falar no atual ministro da saúde que dispensa comentários.

O primeiro escalão dita a tendência, mas são o segundo e terceiro escalões que realmente gastam a grana. Claro que o primeiro escalão do Bozo é de doer, mas no apagar das luzes a Dilmãe deu uma dentro exigindo que o 2o e 3o escalões fossem mais profissionais, e por incrível que pareça, têm sido.

&gt; O gráfico mostra claramente o quanto mais existia de verba em C&amp;T em comparação ao momento atual.

Essa verba é a real ou a virtual. Não sei se você sabe, mas essa foi minha iteração inicial: a verba destinada pra CT&amp;I  sempre foi contingenciada. Claro que tinha mais verba: o país estava indo bem, seguindo a onda de crescimento global. O PT podia e devia ter aproveitado melhor, não aproveitou. Vide os resultados nos rankings mundiais. Era essa verba toda? Aí tenho minhas dúvidas.

&gt;Sério que você acha que em algum momento da história do Brasil houve dinheiro sobrando para C&amp;T?

Corrigi a frase de bonança pra pujança. Sim, o ministério já teve um orçamento bem legal. A ponto de se poder gastar em pesquisas ruins e mandar gente sem qualificação pra fora. Não fosse a roubalheira e a má gestão, teríamos resultados bem melhores.",1601510548

"SaltLakeCity","t5_2r7ac","I bet the resort hotel prices are straight up fucking bonkers during that week (better than the next week, I suppose) but you should consider looking into the possibility of staying at least one night at the Cliff Lodge at Snowbird. You will guarantee first chair in the morning, can treat yourself to a fun night at the pool, good food, and drinking at the Tram Club. It’s super fun and would be a cool experience for someone out of town especially. I also think that the Ikon Pass gets you discounts at the Lodge. At least I know I got discounts on lodging with my Ikon Pass last year.

As far as getting up the canyon, it is extremely reliable if it doesn’t snow. If it DOES snow, particularly a lot, there’s a significant likelihood your entire day will be ruined by delays or you won’t even get to ski. They close the canyons often to traffic for avalanche control. Staying up at the resort will prevent this. As a locals tip, last year I bit the bullet and paid money to stay at the resort when I knew it was going to dump and there was a risk the canyons would close to traffic. This way, I was able to get up to the resort the night before, enjoy myself thoroughly, and ski first tracks in (literally) chest deep powder. And the canyons never opened to cars that day, so we were one of maybe only a few hundred people staying at the resort that got to ski one of the best days of my life. 

Obviously this requires a spur of the moment planning for locals, but yeah, even we stay at the resorts sometimes to avoid the potential canyons closing. BCC closes less often than LCC, or at least last year. You shouldn’t have too much of an issue getting up to BCC.

If you care at all about nightlife, restaurants, or bars, maybe don’t stay in Sandy. If you are purely focused on money and time to resort in the morning, Sandy is just fine and will work nicely for you. I’d still recommend splurging on a night at the Bird if you can afford it. BCC is less hassle generally.",1601510550

"Periods","t5_2s14a","Im not a doctor, but it sounds like spotting, very normal, probably nothing to worry about. I get it sometimes, as do many people that I know, even the very regular ones. Ive also heard of a lot of people who randomly start spotting who never had before, or who start having different kinds of periods (like the colour or texture will change, or it will start being super short, or super long, or irregular, etc). 

Full disclaimer, maybe im too relaxed with this stuff, but thats because ive had weird irregular periods my entire life. Random spotting, unnaturally heavy flow, irregular periods, etc. I used to get super freaked out everytime something weird happened (which was all the time), going to the doctor all the time, posting and asking questions, taking preg tests, etc. I started understanding that periods are weird and random and even doctors dont fuller understand them. Everytime I went to the doctor for something like this, they told me it was fine. Thats how I came to accept the chaos of periods.",1601510551
"k12sysadmin","t5_2wnyn","I have been very happy with 2x Ruckus Virtual SmartZone in a cluster and R610 APs. We were able to go with fewer APs than our previous design and Meraki/Cisco proposals. In all it saved a lot of money. 

The controllers are a lot nicer than my very ancient Cisco WLC and give more knobs to turn than Meraki (which we use for switching). The dynamic psk feature is pretty cool for dumb iot equipment that doesn't support 802.1x.

My complaints are that the vSZ system requirements are really high on RAM (32GB) and SCI is the same. Also I have had dumb licensing mistakes cut off my network twice. First time was when I assigned the licenses to my pool, they weren't actually assigned to the controller. So when my 30 day trials ended all my APs except for one turned off their radios. More recently I had a controller fail due to some environment problems. To replace it I had to remove the dead controller from the cluster. Well, that controller had all my AP licenses mapped to its serial and when I removed it all my AP radios turned off again. Their license self service portal would not allow me to reassign licenses, so I had to wait on chat support for them to jiggle the handle before I could reassign licenses.

I use Unifi at home and I love it. However I don't think it is ready for prime time in my school network.",1601510551

I spawn in with a pistol. For round one, I shoot each zombie 4 times and then knife, killing 6 zombies at 170 points per kill. Then, on round 2, I shoot each zombie 8 times and then knife, killing 8 zombies at 210 points per kill. Then, on round 3, I also shoot each zombie 8 times and knife, killing another 13 zombies at 210 points per kill. On round 4, 8 shots and 2 knives, giving me another 18 kills at 220 points each.

6x170 + 8x210 + 13x210 + 18x220 = 9,390 points at the end of round 4. I buy an AR for 1,500 points and have 7,890 points left over.

I spawn in with an AR, and knife 6 zombies at 130 points each on round one, because a rifle shot will kill them. On round 2, I shoot each zombie once and then knife, for 8 sets of 140 points. On round 3, I do the same thing, for another 13 sets of 140 points. On round 4, I shoot each zombie twice and then knife, for 18 sets of 150 points.

6x130 + 8x140 + 13x140 + 18x150 = 6,420 points at the end of round 4. I don’t have to pay 1,500 points for an AR, but I still have less points than the guy using the pistol, who now has a pistol **and** an AR.

&gt; 
&gt; 

Copy that. Just making sure we're on the same page.

&gt; I agree, that's why I was referencing the Nazis, because they can be used to provide a timescale to judge when fascist movements must or can be engaged.

A timescale? Not *really*. To me it's not about ""how long have they been being Nazis?"", Nazi Germany provides a *degree* of extremism and most importantly *actual illegal actions* that are required before engagement makes sense for a *foreign power* exterminating millions of people. We can't exactly drag and drop that situation onto America. I mean... if you tell me there's a fascist movement sponsored by Iowa or whatever that is rounding up the minority groups into work camps and they've started dropping Zyklon-B pellets into their living quarters my first reaction isn't going to be ""well we should go punch somebody"", it's going to be ""call the FBI and federalize the National Guard"", y'know? And if that's not what we're talking about, then it's not a good allegorical comparison.

&gt; Even the government is worried about the degree to which white nationalists and far-right movements have infiltrated law enforcement, so I don't think ""just call the cops"" is an answer that everyone can rely on.

Can you expand on the latter function? Haven't the right-leaning domestic terrorists and criminals been arrested by law enforcement in the instances they didn't kill themselves before we got to them, or whatever? I'm just finding it hard to imagine a situation where a white nationalist is committing actual crimes and the police or federal agents are like ""eh, looks fine to me, Heil Hitler fellow nationalist!""

&gt; As for the problem being solved, it's the ability of fascist movements to recruit openly and in public.

Yeah, the first amendment (or specifically *NAACP v. Alabama*) guarantees your right to freedom of association. Every now and then that means folks are going to associate with people I don't like. This isn't even a 'slippery slope' situation so much as me being confused about why people associating with one another in groups is a problem. I don't care if you're the DSA, Antifa, neo-Nazis of America, the KKK, or... whatever. It's your right to get together and share your bad ideas with one another. It's my right to get my own group together to tell you to ""shut up"". Thanks to *also* the first amendment, it's also my right to have more people that want the KKK to shut up give me money so I can buy a bullhorn and tell them to ""shut up"" louder than they can shout about wanting to hang me from a tree. And if I have *enough* friends, I can even petition the government with money by donating to candidates that will tell the KKK to ""shut up"" for me. Because 'murica. 

&gt; If the public sees that the people will not tolerate certain beliefs, members of the public are less likely to be converted to those beliefs. How well it works is questionable, and I'm not claiming that now is the time for such actions, but the logic checks out.

I don't think it does. Your recourse for ""people associating that I don't like"" is to present a competing movement or idea; not intimidation through violence. 

I don't tolerate groups of democrats getting together- when they do they invariably pull themselves further and further left and end up proposing ridiculous social programs and anti-American beliefs that threaten the safety and sovereignty of... blah blah, you get it. Pretend I actually hold this belief. *This* is the slippery slope argument; because we say it's okay to use threats of violence to stop groups of people from getting together and sharing their views- we've just entered the losing side of the argument that was put forth in the case against the NAACP in the 50s. ""These people are dangerous to the national fabric when they congregate, so we need to know who they are... (and once you tell us, later some of our friends are going to cut holes in their sheets and visit them so they stop)""

Sure, women are attracted to muscles and ""tall, dark and handsome"" men (which most male VG characters are), but much more of their attraction is based on character traits like assertiveness, aggressiveness, confidence, dominance, etc, than mens attraction is to analogous attributes in women.  And you can see this in characters as well, female characters have pretty huge variety with regards to their personalities, whereas male characters tend to be if not actual or near carbon-copies of each other, then at least follow VERY consistent trends (regardless of other personality traits, they are almost always aggressive, assertive, dominant and confident, or at the very least, more like those than they are not).",1601510553

You can literally repeat this process on your top performing posts to see which hashtags your type of content dominates. Assuming you post the same style of content

Step 1 tap the blue promote button and go through the process of setting up an ad but remembers your not actually going to run the ad its just to see the analytics of the post

Step 2 while your post is in review phase click the button to view insights and scroll down to the bottom and you should see the hashtags you used for the post and the amount of impressions you got for every single tag

Step 3 rinse and repeat till you have a set of 20 - 24

Dude. Seriously? If people want sexy characters fucking let them it's not sexist or misogynistic, like Lady's design in DMC 4 is made for her to be Sexy sure but you know in DMC 3 you can be shirtless Dante through the whole game right? Seems pretty square to me dude. If Capcom wanted to release a Shirtless Leon I'd be A-Ok with that as well.

Yeah so Capcom's designs are apparently excessive but games like Nier Automata have both Sexy robot ladies and Sexy robot men, though I'm willing to bet you would only ever bring up 2B


&gt;You being a full grown man with dick and balls, doesn’t mean you get a pass. You’re not 12 anymore. Your words matter. The things you defend matter.

Yeah, that's why I'm telling you how much of a stupid argument this is 

&gt;The reason this is not ok... well the last portion of your previous comment kinda says everything we already knew.
If you’re sexualizing women in video games, I highly doubt you flip the switch off irl.



Seriously dude you think I play games to *Sexualize Women* 
and that because I play as sexy characters in video games I somehow sexualize every women I meet It's not me who has issues....

And you clearly dont know me well enough to judge me irl


If a character happens to be sexy I dont much care, I don't play Ada in Resident Evil cause she's got a a dress that shows her legs or tight pants that show off her ass, I like playing her because this chick oozes confidence, she could walk into hell with a wink and a smile and not be phased at all, why? cause she's a bad ass super spy.

(Oh and she's got a fucking cool grappling hook but that's besides the point)

"French","t5_2rd5t","My first thought is to say 'Calm down.'  I remember literally having to hold back the tears in a French exam (I was 14 years old, I think) because I was struggling to understand a passage. Now I realise that there was no need for that.  Just do your best... and if you do badly, well, you just explain that you need more time to master the language. EVERYBODY struggles at first... and in fact for quite a while.

Here are a few ideas off the top of my head, but remember that to improve your writing takes time and practice:  I cannot give you a magic formula for tomorrow.

As for technique:  keep your answers / essays simple and logical.

For a summary, look at the main ideas in the text you are summarising.  They are usually in the first sentence of each paragraph.  Paraphrase them, and you will have a reasonable summary, usually.

There are some handy tips on the web for writing French.  For example:

1.  Avoid complicated structures if you are not sure of them.  Better to be simple and correct than complicated and incoherent.
2. Use logical connectors to guide your reader through your argument. These include 'Puisque' (since - use it at the beginning of a sentence), 'parce que' (because), 'car' (since), 'donc' (therefore), 'en conséquence' (consequently), à cause de (because of), en suite (='puis', then), 'mais' (='but').
3. If you can remember, there are a few words and phrases that are ... nice ... in written French.  If you use some of these rather than their everyday equivalents, you will impress your teacher ... even if there are some errors elsewhere.  Here are a few:  
Certes (='Certainly', or 'I do agree'.)  
Lorsque (= 'quand')  
laid (= 'moche', that is in English 'ugly')  
en revanche (= 'par contre)  
également (='aussi')  
parvenir (conjugated like 'venir') (='achever', to manage, to succeed at)  
Point n'est besoin d'en dire plus. (='Il n'y a pas besoin d'en dire plus.') = There's no need to say any more about it.  This is an old but accepted phrase... just learn it off by heart and toss it in at the end of your essay.  It works almost always !!! But write it exactly as I have, beginning with 'point' ('ne ... pas' = 'ne ... point', but here the 'point' comes first.)
4. Try to avoid repetition of the same words over and over.  For example, rather than ""Il a dit ... elle a dit"" over and over, use other words like 'elle a répondu' (she replied), 'Il a insisté' , 'il a démandé"" etc. In  general, try to use more specific words ... e.g. épuisé (exhausted) rather than ""très fatigue"", il a hurlé (he shouted) rather than 'il a dit très fort'. Of course, this means exapanding your vocab, and that means reading, reading, reading ...  a long-term strategy.

I hope all this helps.  Good luck, and don't despair.  In time, you will improve!",1601510555

So, yeah, they were mostly separated from the rest of the world because of the Atlantic and Pacific ocean. Maybe I'm not educated enough, but I don't remember any instances of previous contact either in the Americas by other cultures, or people from the Americas making contact with people from other continents.

They had access the the large variety of cultures within their continent, yes. But considering the difficulty travelling large distances back then (especially without horses) I don't recall any instance of, say, cultures above what is now Kentucky interacting with cultures below, what is now, Mexico.

Plus, Europe was already known to have trade routes to parts of Africa and all the way to far Eastern Asia at that point; which, according to the (potentially) faulty logic I've laid out above, allowed for a significantly larger amount of collective knowledge and information to trade for and with.

But please, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong; I'm not an expert on this matter by any means. And I do want to be clear: I'm not trying to lump all Mesoamerican cultures together; I just don't have a ton of education in the area despite the bare minimum, so I can only make vague generalizations, which I'm fully aware could be wrong. It's about the same as what I know of most of Europe in between the years of 0BCE and 800AD",1601510556

"JordanPeterson","t5_32jqy","The best piece of advice I ever got for this was simple: when the time is right, you'll know what to do.

One can dismiss this as mystical wisdom. I had a hard time comprehending it. Then the time came, and I knew what needed to be done. Sometimes the best direction is time itself.

The problem with giving advice is it dis-empowers you from coming to those conclusions yourself. Once in a while this is not a bad thing. But if you need someone else to decide for you all the time, that's when it's not healthy. I think that's what JP is getting at - he's getting a lot of people that are looking to him for answers. But you can only feed a man for one day when you give him a fish. 

Teaching people how to be more introspective, listening to their intuitions, trusting their gut feeling, and having faith in themselves that things will work themselves out if you follow your intuitions - that is real power. That is the age old wisdom of the ancients that has been lost among us in this time.",1601510556

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","This is a good answer, but to be abundantly clear, as suggested by the great first link you had, it seems unlikely that the Proud Boys should be classified as ""racist"" group, at least in the strictest definition of the word. Also It should be pointed out that the FBI has stated that they have NOT classified the Proud Boys as an ""extremist group with ties to white nationalism"". The link you had for that was a Clark County Sheriff's memo NOT written by the FBI but rather written by the Clark County Sheriff's office, and the FBI denied that it was their intent to classify the entire group in this manner and ascribed the memo's mistake to a misunderstanding. The only official word we have from the FBI is a denial of the classification.

https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2018/12/head-of-oregons-fbi-bureau-doesnt-designate-proud-boys-as-extremist-group.html

https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/12/08/fbi-says-proud-boys-are-not-an-extremist-group-after-all/

The mention of ties to white nationalism is likely due to the fact that some members were present at the Unite the Right Rally. However, the founder has unequivocally denounced racism and said that ""If anyone from our group showed up at Unite the Right, they were instantly booted, never spoken to again, ex-persona non-grata. And I made that clear months before”. 

https://abcnews.go.com/US/proud-boys-founder-denies-inciting-violence-responds-feels/story?id=59758209

However the extent of this crackdown on attendees may be slightly doubted since Enrique Tarrio admits to attending the rally but says he did not participate in the march due to misgivings. But it may be argued that he was given some leeway since he A) is not white and B) did not actually participate in the march.

So to be clear I am not defending the Proud Boys. I think it is an awful group, but you don't have to be racist to be evil. I think classifying the group as racist is incorrect and may lead to arguments against them being dismissed/discredited due to an incorrect classification of what they are.",1601510557

&gt; Last night there was a presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.

&gt; So everyone watched last night and many people thought &amp;quot;No one won.&amp;quot; But that&amp;#039;s not true, and it was immediately born out by polls that showed Trump had disappointed even his supporters and that Biden gained in all demographics on all issues.

&gt; Nothing will or could mean that, but it does mean Biden won the debate and Trump fell further behind, squandering one of his final opportunities for a comeback.

Never in places like Chicago where a weekend never goes by with out multiple murders of blacks from blacks. 

&amp;#x200B;

So its not a far stretch to think that maybe this was not racist but political.  Saying all lives matter in public around the wrong people can get you killed.  This might also explain why this person who instead of friendly public debate on differences like we Used to have , decided to make his voice heard by defacing a political message.

But that doesn't mean Covid wasn't responsible for their death! Someone can live with diabetes for decades. Someone can live with high blood pressure for decades. Someone can have a fucked up heart and still live a somewhat normal life.

Covid cut their lives short. Covid was responsible for a lot of these deaths. You can't just say ""well those 200,000 people would've died anyways because of their comorbidity"" many of those people would have continued to live for years to come while keeping their medical issues at bay.

Sure, don't get me wrong, some would have died. But not 200,000 within the span of literally less than a year. You're looking at that shit all wrong. It's nothing short of ignorant. You pass that bullshit information around like Covid is nothing to worry about, some impressionable kid reads your post, and then ends up killing his grandmother 2 months from now because he wasn't cautious enough.

Also, at the absolute worst case scenario, you look a little goofy wearing a mask. Best case scenario, hundreds of thousands of lives are saved. Are you so much of a fucking twat that you'd rather risk killing someone, comorbidity or not, because of some bullshit ass right-wing propaganda talking point?

&gt;Solving poverty unrelated to race is an separate conversation.

But it's not, you said it yourself, the main way race is involved is through bad neighborhoods and from the current way bad neighborhoods are linked to low education funding/low educating in general. So why not fix those, which are the actual problem?

I’m not a religious person so I’m not speaking about spirituality, but for me, seeing how he shaped my life, my personality, the stories we shared and even getting to see him in my kids who didn’t get a chance to know him brought me healing.  He’s still with me.  His words, his love; that didn’t go away and it’s impossible to be erased.  Do your best to lean on that during this time.

"thewalkingdead","t5_2rygv","My guess for the layout if filming goes according to plan in 2021:  

Season 11a - Fall 2021  
Rick Movie 1 - Early 2022  
Season 11b - Early 2022  
Rick Movie 2 - Summer 2022  
Season 11c - Fall 2022  
Rick Movie 3 - Fall 2022 or Early 2023  
Daryl &amp; Carol - Fall 2023 in TWD's timeslot  

This could work out for them if they film at least the first 2 of Rick's movies back-to-back and they could very well do all 3 and if each film takes 3 months to film, he would be away from home for 9 months which is still a long time but that's about the time he'd be away from home filming the show so it would basically be like he would be away filming the show but I don't think the movies would take 3 months each to film. My guess is probably a month and a half to 2 months. It's not an Avengers-level film and would very much still be rooted in the world of The Walking Dead so I don't think it would need a humongous budget.",1601510561

Instead, what they ""force"" these businesses to do is to get them to sign up with ""approved"" VPNs.

Most companies have their own providers in any case and while the law isn't strictly enforced, the law is still on the books.

Also, a reminder that if these are pro-China trolls, it's probably not worth it to report them to the Chinese authorities.  In fact, assume these trolls have the authority to troll as they please and that reporting them to the Chinese cyberpolice is just a means of getting you extradited to China.

While I believe the risk is still very, very small, it’s a real thing you have to consider and you have to weigh the trade off.

I’ve switched my view on food and this really helped me adjust my mind around weight loss. Within 3 months I lost 10 pounds. I’m on a low carb diet, and cutting out pasta, bread, and rice works really well for my body. I chose foods that I love to eat everyday (I.e. cheese, meat, veggies, little chocolates and treats) while avoiding anything carb heavy. I suggest finding a diet that you enjoy and that works with your body. If calorie counting isn’t working, try a different strategy. 

With working out: I do low impact workouts so that I don’t feel burdened with doing anything tough. This helps me stay consistent and do it more often. I.e. I walk an hour a day which is better than doing a hard core work out twice a week.

"alberta","t5_2qxon","the solution to that isn't to not look at race tho. you can look at race while still acknowledging other factors such as class.

like, idk, you're literally just saying that acknowledging the impact a person's race can have on their life is the same as being racist. I don't buy that for a second, and I don't understand that rhetoric in a country where people were massacred, segregated into race-specific camps, and re-educated all on the basis of their race. just ignoring the effect that had seems like the definition of willful ignorance to me. how can we address such issues if we don't address race specific issues? 

I might be more inclined to agree with you if there was a concerted effort to address the worst of the worst poverty within our country, but I haven't seen any significant systemic changes that point to that being true. even then I'd argue that looking at issues from different lenses (race focused, gender focused, etc) can help us learn more about how the underlying issues like poverty work, and how we can fix them.",1601510563

I did most of my science classes at night as AD enlisted, then I found out about EMDP2 (a postbacc for enlisted members) through USUHS and did that. It started in 2014 and only 100ish military members have done it. I also helped another applicant successfully get accepted into EMDP2. Now, I'm in med school.

PM me to talk through things in detail to help you decide how you would like to approach this goal.

Edit: I'd like to add one more thought: Keep in mind EMDP2 doesn't currently have linkage with USU school of medicine (ie. no agreement exists where you're automatically accepted if you get a certain GPA and MCAT score like in some civ postbacc programs). It is in the FAQs on the program page.

However, that shouldn't deter you at all because this program sets you up for success. To approximate current trends, let's say 60-70% go to USUHS and 25-35% go to a civilian school on HPSP after EMDP2. And 5% don't earn the MCAT score they need (after retakes) or decide this isn't right for them. When you apply, apply broadly to a minimum of 10+ schools like a civilian, then wait and see what sticks. If you have more than one option, you pick your favorite.",1601510564

I’m not saying CDPR is innocent and not forcing their employees to work more than legally allowed.

I mentioned elsewhere today that I played a Kurfurst battle on Land of Fire in which there were only 8 ships per side, and I spawned alone with an Odin on the right flank.  We were (as it turned out) against an enemy Kurfurst, a Zara, a Hipper, and a stealthy Kagero, constantly outspotting and peppering us with Torps as we tried to advance and engage the ships firing at us nearly from the start of the match (no DD on our flank meant we had no chance of spotting them first).

In the end, we downed the Zara, Hipper, and I crippled the Kurfurst in a brawl, before falling to the Kagero's torpedoes.  I ended the battle with 120,800 damage in about 7 minutes of combat.

I finished second on the team, with 2050 Exp, and we Won.  We won the match, and I was in second place (our DD was first, IIRC).   My final ""net earnings"" were 39,000 Credits, but this was only because I'd run a Rare Credit Booster, worth 40,000+ Credits extra.

Commit such long time (literally a third of an average lifespan) to a single piece of work is put a lot of trust in chance.

Even tough i didn't understand the main focus of the story, i appreciated the way story telling was made, never got bored and I especially loved the introduction of the quest. What seems like an every day quest at first takes big proportions and you're send quite down the rabbit hole.

I strongly believe you can’t live in the past with regards to wrongs done historically by the English, it would be ridiculous to hate a nation of people for the actions of those gone before.
I do however feel strongly about Irish independence and will always view Ireland as one country - I don’t think there is an argument that it is 2 as I used to live on the border and lived between the north and south and for me it is all Ireland.
There isn’t really the same passion for it here, I’m not sure if it’s because scotland while part of Britain hasn’t actually been divided or if it’s because the people of Ireland particularly in the North were treated poorly with atrocities committed by the British army in more recent times, but that being said, I don’t think financially it really benefits Ireland or Scotland at the moment - and I don’t think if Ireland was given a referendum that we would vote for independence (although I would always love it if we did) 
The atrocities committed are in the past, and many lives were lost in Ireland needlessly and Scotland historically, I think peace is the best we can hope for and I think the majority of Scotland are realistic with regards to that.",1601510568

It seems limited in some ways (layout and widget sizing) but with some nice changes like the sheer depth of integration you can achieve with the OS and apps.

I'm sorry that you've been teased for being a redhead that sounds like some childish bs. Not worth your energy. There are plenty of women who are SUPER into that. It's absolutely not a con. 

Your physical appearance is not what's holding you back, its your desire to change the ""rules"" that make you uncomfortable. fear of rejection/ failure and your inexperience holding you back. The good news is those are both things you can work on, improve, grow, and over come. You owe it to yourself to work on these things. You deserve the best relationship you can get.

Trump also refused to denounce white supremacist groups and hate groups, and instead told the Proud Boys to ""stand down and stand by"", and to ""watch closely at the polls"". Hes fuckin disgusting, and literally anyone who STILL backs him after EVERYTHING hes said and done in his pathetic life is either flat out stupid/blind, or is very possibly racist/sexist/all of the above and finds comfort in knowing that our president shares his or her views. They feel validated in their fucked up, discriminatory beliefs when they see him being allowed to remain in power.",1601510571

"monarchism","t5_2s6v1","I realized a few months ago that a lot of daytime talk shows were starting to get super political (based on ads I’d been seeing). In the US, it is really the lowest on the IQ curve who watch these shows, so it’s pretty worrying that *they* are the ones getting worked up. Well, it was no surprise that the debate resembled an episode of Jerry Springer. Unfortunately, it’s become popular to signal your love of democracy and encourage everyone to vote, as evidenced by the countless ads and reminders on the internet. Unfortunately the lowest among us are picking our leaders now, so I think things will only get worse from here.",1601510571

[Jack](https://maryskelternightmares.fandom.com/wiki/Jack) as [Little Mermaid's](https://maryskelternightmares.fandom.com/wiki/Little_Mermaid) twin sister, but there's a twist I'm willing to share with you from where I got the idea and made it a fanfic(in progress)... said twist is that Jack doesn't have a Massacre Mode like the others; she goes right to Blood Skelter.

"CODZombies","t5_2sal9","Time moves on and so must games. We all have great memories of how zombies was back in the BO1-3 days but that doesn’t mean that the same ideas would work today. Back then we only had 5 updates every 2 years (game launch + 4 DLC packs), that just isn’t acceptable for a AAA game in 2020. Also if the mechanics stayed completely the same over multiple games they’d be no point in buying a new game, we’d just demand new DLC instead. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I’m so glad Treyarch decided not to just play it safe and rehash BO3 this year. They listened to the community but didn’t pander to them.


As for the changes you mentioned, it’s too early to say but they sound promising to me. Exfil is optional and sounds like a great way to end a zombies game that otherwise might last way too long. We’ve all been in games where we’ve gotten bored and it sounds like a great way to end it. I may be wrong but field upgrades sound to me like they could be a cross between a BO4 specialist, BO3 gobblegum, BO1 death machines and traps. The only things I’m not sure about are the weapon rarities and starting with an AR, but I don’t know enough to say if I’ll hate it or not yet.",1601510571

*****
&gt; Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden gestures while speaking during the first presidential debate on Tuesday at Case Western University in Cleveland.

&gt; Joe Biden&amp;#039;s campaign hauled in nearly $10 million during the first presidential debate Tuesday night - smashing its own single-hour fundraising record, as small-dollar donors continue to fuel the former vice president&amp;#039;s mounting money advantage.

&gt; Biden&amp;#039;s campaign raised $3.8 million during the 10 to 11 p.m. hour Tuesday night, as Biden and President Donald Trump clashed in a insult-laden debate.

I don’t own my own company - the benefit of that is I just need to make sure that my work is done and that I’m doing my job. Once I clock out I have my own projects and my own work to do. Whether it’s me learning another language or programming skill or getting drunk and laughing at two old men bicker is irrelevant. 

If the work absolutely needs to get done then you better be ready to pay an actual premium to get it done. But obviously you’re not going to do anything other than what you’re legally required to pay. The difference is that you’re using fear of losing your job if you’re not a “team player” vs actually incentivizing it.

So it will take a few tries to find out what works, and I recommend taking notes and learning from mistakes. Personally I find [this recipe](https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/146127-quick-and-easy-onsen-tamago-hot-spring-soft-boiled-eggs) works perfectly for me with a 10-minute soak (rather than the 12 minutes called for).

"politics","t5_2cneq","Hmmmm do the rates vary by state? Perhaps the plans on offer vary by state.  I made 18k a year (gross) last time I signed up for an ACA plan.  I have a BCBS plan, $65 a month, no deductible.  I could have paid less, as low as $10 a month if I got a plan with a deductible or higher specialist copays, but I only see specialists so I needed that cost to be low.  I also end up hospitalized once or twice a year (lucky me) so I needed that coinsurance for hospitalizations to not be high.

Does not include dental, that could add another $20ish bucks, I don’t remember exactly, didn’t opt in for a dental plan since it only covers cleanings and checkups and I need extensive dental work.  I don’t need to be reminded at every cleaning that my teeth are rotting out but I can’t afford to do anything about it.

I would think at $25k gross the plan after subsidies would be less than $100 for a similar setup.  Unless there is a huge leap in premium and deductible options at the $20k mark or something.",1601510576

Y ve como dejan la playa despues de semana santa.

&gt; Te invito a hablarle de buena forma a la gente que veas dejando basura en las playas y calles.

Es invitar a que me mienten la madre o peor.

&gt; Las playas son publicas, esta reforma solo ayuda a combatir la privatización por grandes hoteles, y terratenientes que prohiben el acceso si no consumes o pagas la cuota.

Pues deberian ver bien quien se va encargar de las playas ahora, porque nos guste o no las playas que no se cuidan se llenan de basura.

&gt; Aquí en Quintana Roo es un gran problema esto, donde se ve que hoteles y corporaciones cierran pasos existentes a las playas, dejando pobladores originarios del lugar sin donde entrar a la zona costera solo por que extrangeros y gente rica llega y compra las tierras que colindan con el mar.

Quintana Roo se poblo por el turismo, supongo que alla todo es resort, aca en Sonora la mayoria de las playas son terrenos ejidales y no hay hoteles ni nada, los que cobran la entrada son pescadores o ejidatarios.

&gt; Además basura llega sin fin desde el mar, lo unico que mantiene limpias las playas es la gente que toma su tiempo para recogerla y ponerla en el lugar adecuado.

&gt;You may have set yourself up to struggle here. Did you know anyone besides this former classmate? 

One other, they were around but didn't recognize me. This was more of a mass Facebook-invite rather than a personal call, so I'm not surprised.

&gt;Think about my questions above, and then think about what you said here. Did they *also* walk in without knowing anyone? I'm going to guess not. 

You're right, I can't really tell.

&gt;But I'm struggling to see the connection between this and the rest of your post. Nothing you described suggested that your appearance played a role in what happened, especially if you're right that you were dressed well. 

I feel like my appearance is the thing that has always held be back so I'd just wager that it was a factor here as well.

&gt;Do you have people you can go with to events like this in the future? If nothing else, they can be a conduit between you and mutual friends, which tends to be the easiest way to socialize with strangers at social gatherings.

"pokemontrades","t5_2rmov","Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. Here are a few tips to minimize your risks when trading in Sw/Sh and LGPE:

1. **If you receive an offer by PM or Reddit chat**, [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpokemontrades) and redirect the other user to post publicly on the subreddit. PM, DM and chat trading is prohibited by [Rule 4](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_4_-_do_not_discuss_trades_privately.). 
2. Verify who you are trading with. Since another random player can coincidentally use the same trade code that you and your trading partner are using, it is important that you double check that you have paired with with the correct trader.
3. [Full details](https://wk.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny and/or event Pokémon.
4. You must have been granted [Poké ball](https://i.imgur.com/XgAhEXa.png) level flair or higher (10 or more approved trades on FlairHQ) to make trades involving shiny or event Pokémon.

In addition, once you're done trading in this thread, you can mark your thread as closed by commenting `[close]` as a top-level reply to your post to update the flair and let others know you're not looking for further trades. This is completely optional and you don't have to do it if you'd like others to continue to offer trades in this thread!

He tried NC with her for sometime, but he was always afraid of regretting that, and eventually she managed to crawl back into his life, helping him with something innocent, then giving him a compliment, a good advice, and then, bam!

"microdosing","t5_2yt3g",".5g is quite large for a microdose of mushrooms. I would say start around .1g, like you really don’t need a lot. Plus t’s not like the more you take the faster or more likely it will help you, honestly in the case of microdosing; less is more. 

How often were you dosing? Always remember to take at least 1 day off until the next dose. Tolerance builds instantly and you basically just waste the whole purpose of microdosing, therapeutic wise at least.

I’ve suffered with depression &amp; generalized anxiety for over a decade (I’m 22) and I must say these have absolutely helped me—while no antidepressant/anxiety meds have ever come close to, they’ve honestly ruined me &amp; almost cost me my life. I know there is potential in these mushrooms for helping really anyone who is looking for help in a specific area. But you gotta remember you MUST have an intention. A specific intention. Not just “I hope to not be anxious anymore” because that’s a bit unreasonable, anxiety is something of our nature that we can never get rid of (trust me I wish we could just not experience it). Instead have an intention of like “I hope to be able to become aware of my anxiety &amp; not act on its impulses” or something like that. 

What I’ve personally gained from my experience (which is quite opposite of yours; my first month every dose day—.1g once every 3 days—was absolutely amazing &amp; hopeful) is insight on my own actions &amp; feelings. Instead of repeating the same arguments with my family and getting the same upsetting result, I subconsciously took arguments in another direction &amp; came at them with peace &amp; understanding—which was something I could never do because I’m so reactive &amp; sensitive by nature that I could never get those few seconds to stop &amp; think before reacting. Also, all this knowledge I have gained through these mushrooms, have been taught subconsciously. Like I said previously, I came at arguments through a different perspective to which only after I realized “wow, that didn’t end badly. I actually kept my cool.” Which for me has been life changing. 

I just wanted to tell you this so you don’t get discouraged &amp; start thinking “these don’t work”. They sure as hell work. The mushrooms know what you need and will deliver, you just gotta try and have patience because nothing changes overnight, and depression sure as hell doesn’t dissipate after a month. The longer you’ve had the depression (and severity of course) the longer it’s likely to take for you to heal. But DON’T give up! Time will always be passing by, and these cannot be rushed.

Oh also if you’re looking for a like ‘wake up call’ &amp; you feel ready to accept whatever is to come, then I suggest a trip dose (1.5g+) which can give you those “instant results” you are looking for, but just be prepared that  *the mushrooms always show you what you NEED and not what you WANT.*",1601510579

#Rule 10: SSA, The Reddiquette, Piracy.
&gt;
##Steam Subscriber Agreement
&gt;
&gt;We do not allow posts that break or encourage the breaking of the [Steam Subscriber Agreement](http://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement).
&gt;
&gt;Not only does the Steam SSA have it's place and obvious good reasons for existing, but a lot of inexperienced people browse /r/Steam and it would be very unfortunate if they do something that they do not know is against the SSA because someone on /r/Steam told them to do it.
&gt;
&gt;So please do not detail or facilitate how to break it, such as how to use VPNs to bypass restrictions, selling Steam accounts, sharing Steam accounts, etc. Breaking them on /r/Steam, e.g. by creating a post to sell your Steam account isn't allowed and may result in a ban.
&gt;
&gt;Meta discussion is allowed.
&gt;
##The Reddiquette
&gt;
&gt;Please follow the [Reddiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) as it makes the community more enjoyable and discussions more valuable. These are mainly general points on how to have a successful conversation and we believe that most of them are self-evident.
&gt;
&gt;##Piracy
&gt;
&gt;/r/Steam does not support piracy. Bans are handed out to people who encourage or make euphemisms to it. **Discussion** on piracy is allowed.
&gt;
&gt;Due to Reddit's unclear policy on this matter we feel the need to have this rule to keep the subreddit's integrity in place.
&gt;
&gt;Our opinions on piracy does not matter, and this rule is certainly not in place to censor content. Actual discussion on piracy is allowed. What is not allowed are comments that directly link to such content*(and we believe this is extremely obvious across the whole site of Reddit)*, comments that actively encourage it, and low-quality meme comments*(referred to as euphemisms)*, like ""yarr"", ""time to sail the high seas"", ""to the bay I venture"", etc. These types of comments offer absolutely nothing to a discussion and will be removed.
&gt;
&gt;**Ban lengths:** Directly linking to content or otherwise guiding someone to pirated content immediately earns a permanent ban. Euphemism comments and comments that actively encourage piracy earn either a warning or a 1-day ban, depending on the comment. If the same user continues after the warning or once the short ban has expired, they will earn a slightly longer ban*(time varies on context)*. If after the 2nd ban they still feel the absolute urge to continuing making the same comments they will be permanently banned with an obvious chance to appeal*(appeal=admit they will stop posting such low-quality meme comments, or to stop offering nothing to a discussion by just actively encouraging piracy)*.
&gt;
&gt;Again, we repeat that this rule is not in place to censor content or to push a certain agenda, our opinions on piracy is of no concern. We have this rule due to the unclear policy offered by Reddit.com.

"feminineboys","t5_2vmuo","The thing to note here is that the type of person who pose danger to trans women because of their trans- and homophobia doesn't distinguish between a trans woman and a man who just wants to pass as a woman.

The term ""trap"" is a reference to a situation. A situation where a heterosexual man finds himself in a sexual situation with someone with a penis that he doesn't want to be in but because they looked like a woman he assumed they had a vagina. It doesn't matter if it was supposed to be degrading or not. It is a word that implies deception. That people with dicks dress up as women and tricks straight guys. So the issue with the term is that it gives legitimacy to the fear of that situation that drives hostility towards trans women. It paints it as predatory to be a woman (or look like a woman) with a penis.

That is why reclaiming it doesn't really work in the same way as with a lot of other slurs. Most slurs are not words with another meaning that causes a harmful association. The harmful meaning of most slurs comes from how the word has been used, not what it originally meant. So reclaiming it becomes about giving it a non-derogatory meaning by using it non-derogatory.

But the problem with ""trap"" is not that it is used derogatory, but for how it legitimizes and fuels the worldview that trans women (and men who dress to look like women) are predatory and deceitful and literally *trapping* people in sexual situations with dicks they have not consented to.",1601510579

They even like to play with discourse for, by giving ridiculous reasons, they discredit the seriousness of Christians. They delight in acting in bad faith, since they seek not to persuade by sound argument but to intimidate and disconcert. If you press them too closely, they will abruptly fall silent, loftily indicating by some phrase that the time for argument is past.

&gt;@ low percent) Downtilt -&gt; dash \~1-3 frames for momentum -&gt; buffered shorthop nair

Do you actually have time to dash after downtilt at low percent ? If so this might help a lot with my problem since no drift fair is so much easier to handle (if I understand correctly, you dash, jump with no direction with a buffered nair, and fastfall asap). Now that I've seen how exactly the nair hitbox works thanks to an other user answer, it gets really easier to predict where the opponent is going as long as I don't have to take into account my forward drift AND their DI.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;ledge jump and hold buffer jump and an attack

That's a mixup at the ledge that I particularly like. The only problem about instant double jump is that while it's very good with aerials, it's incredibly risky to go for a special like disable or confusion since you're basically doing a getup attack without any iframe. The good thing about drop down jump into disable or confusion is that you can actually hit the special without taking much risks since you don't have to actually commit to the stage and can just poke with only your head above the ledge to have disable hitbox active. Might be a bad idea to confusion under the stage though since I have no jump left and have to regrab with up b",1601510582

Even with the pain it is important to try and stay strong, strong ligaments and muscles will help support the joint and actually relieve pain to an extent. 

I went through a very similar thing except my pains started with I was 8, and I saw my first rheumatologist age 13. 

Ask for all of the tests and as nyxe12 said go alone if your parents are talking over you and you feel as though you aren’t being heard. 
Keep a diary of symptoms, where ur pain is, when it hurts most. Is it worst when u wake up ect and take it will you to your next apt. It’s terrifying going alone for sure but if you have ur diary of information regarding your health it will be easier to answer questions they may ask. 

Also try ice packs and heat packs on your knee they might help relive some pain, but you won’t know till you try at this stage. 

I’m 21 now and have only just been diagnosed after seeing doctors on both sides of the world. 
Best of luck!",1601510584

Hatha: Stand a lot and strengthen your legs and glutes

Ashtanga: Roll through your postures and sometimes roll while in your postures

Bikram: Do yoga in a really hot room and sweat a lot

Iyengar: Be precise and aligned but don't sweat much if at all...only your mind should sweat

Vinyasa: Go with the flow and flow from one posture to another to another while staying connected to your breath. Go fast and call it Power Yoga.

Obama isn't squeaky clean either with his drone bombings, but I think he's a decent man that thought the ends justified the means... While not 100% equivalent, I think it can be somewhat said for W as well).

Trump is just a sleazeball. He's unintelligent, narcissistic, and hasn't shown any true leadership qualities. He hasn't delivered on any of his promises either.

Imagine: You are struggling financially. You have a few friends who always talk about their big houses, exotic vacations, and guilting you in to expensive outings that make you uncomfortable. Pretty sure most people would feel those friends are spoiled and inconsiderate.

Imagine: A friend’s spouse passed away. But their newly engaged cousin only calls them to share wedding plans and stories about how romantic it all is. They don’t ask any questions about their friend’s grief. That cousin would be considered an insensitive witch.

But when pregnant people completely stop checking in with friends who are struggling, or when loss compels us to take a break from others, or when baby talk steals all support from you - then it’s the infertile couple who’s being selfish?! I don’t get it.

"USPS","t5_2r25j","&gt;They will “punish” you by scheduling you everyday and calling you off. Basically forcing you to use your phone or never have a scheduled rest day.

Do not answer your phone if you are scheduled to work,

A CCA that is scheduled, will be paid the minimum (2 or 4 hours) if they simply show up.

[http://nalcbranch34.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CCA-Reporting-Guarantee.pdf](http://nalcbranch34.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/CCA-Reporting-Guarantee.pdf)

 *Article 8.8.D.* 

*Any CCA employee who is scheduled to work and who reports to work in a post office or facility with 200 or more work years of employment shall be guaranteed four (4) hours of work or pay. CCAs at other post offices and facilities will be guaranteed two (2) hours work or pay.* 

They are violating the contract by calling you off as well...they only think they are getting around the rules, but a steward will set them straight.

Sure persons with suppressed homosexuality can hold extreme positions against homosexuality. That's not in contest. But I implore you to show in evidence a causal relationship. I just don't think it's there.

I've been saying frequently and I'll say again here, there really are plenty of bigots and preachers against homosexuality that *are not* themselves suppressing sexual orientation. So numerous are they. They are not remarkable, because they are common. Those divided against themselves stand out to you and you recall them as an ""interesting phenomenon"". Bias and all that shit.

"ChoosingBeggars","t5_35fmc","Holy shit. Are you seriously denying that it says the words ""is anyone nice enough?"" You're saying those words aren't there? You think that's my opinion, and those words are not present in that order? 

I've already made it clear it's not a joke, but you're devolving in your argument and you want to suddenly chalk it up to a joke. You could even get on whisper and find this post, everyday, for weeks. Sometimes multiple times a day. And see all the angry replies. You are welcome to do that, but it's easier for you to say it's all a joke and everyone's a liar. 

I'm not asserting context. I'm saying, he said the words, ""is anyone nice enough."" That's not an opinion, that's just a fact. He said those words in that order. If you are unable to read, perhaps that's the issue. I cannot imagine any other possible way you could convince yourself that the words ""is anyone nice enough"" not there. 

""You refuse to provide any images of him being choosy or selective.""
My fucking kindergartners are able to understand things faster. Until you can actually understand this VERY simple concept, I'm not replying to you again. I. THINK. THE. CHOOSY. IS. THE. NICE. THING. You don't agree. You think the words mean other things. YOU. YOU. YOU. Not me. Not I. Not this person. It's like saying I think the earth is round, here's a picture of the earth round, and you saying the earth is flat and you haven't proven it's not because I think it's flat and my opinion is fact. You just keep trying to TELL ME WHAT I THINK. It's absolutely asinine. I don't know if it's ignorance, arrogance, or a mix of both, but you are annoyingly obtuse. Stop trying to explain to me what my opinion is, and try for once, understanding that the literal words I'm saying are what I believe. Whether you agree or not means nothing. It's what I believe. You can ""the earth is flat"" but you can't say ""you think the earth is flat."" You can believe whatever you want. Anything and everything. You cannot make me believe it by telling me it's what I believe. Are you unaware that humanity isn't a hive mind? Do you think all people share a singular view on literally everything in existence? Unless you do, you have to understand the concept that I believe differently than you. Are you Jewish? If not we have different religious beliefs. Yet we both exist on this planet. Without self combusting. Because our brains are different. We aren't the same person. You keep telling me you want proof of something I not saying. MY PROOF is the words ""is anyone nice enough."" That's my view. That's what I think. It's very simple. I'm not telling you what you have to believe. So, maybe stop telling me what I have to. You don't think ""is anyone nice enough"" is choosy. Guess what? I DO. ME. I. THIS. PERSON. THE ONE WRITING. OVER HERE. THY. moi, Mich, mou, mène, MEH, em, mi, mulle, minulle, mich, man, eg, mani, meg, lili, nekem, mim, ma, mig, yo, מיר, меня, μου. Is there another laugnage you would like me to say it in? You want me to giive you proof on something I don't believe. I think the choosy is X. You keep demandinig I think it's Y because you disagree with X. But it's not Y, I don't believe Y, I'm not now, nor was I ever saying Y. You are. Not me. I'm not sayinig Y, I'm saying X. You don't have to belive in X to believe I believe X. That's just the facts. 

""And I’ve repeatedly told you and explained that this doesn’t make it choosy.""
You can also say and explain how the earth is flat or how vaccines cause autism, doesn't make it true. Your arrogance is not helping you. You thinking your OPINION is fact, doesn't make it fact. You can't think something and make it an unalienable truth. 2+2=4 Even if you say you keep explaining that it's 5. That doesn't make it 5 simply because you think it is. How you can think your opinions are all fact because you think them is asinine. And since you are perfect and know everything in the world and anything you say or think becomes fact simply because you your holiness says it, there's really nothing else to say. So, please just don't say potatoes don't exist, and therefore make them no longer exist, because I fucking love potatoes.",1601510588

i really like the vocal style and your voice  


listening later in the song, i hear more vocals on the left, seems like you overdubbed the vocals but the one on the left is quite subtle, i suggest you get them more balanced  


i think your song needs to have a kick, i hear it myself in my head bopping groove to your tune, but i dont hear it anywhere, later it comes in during the build up.. that throughout would be good  


also i hear some sizzling in my right speaker so look into something that could be causing that

Make sure you are the biggest fish in the pond, by having duchies with the most counties while being at the domain limit. Bigger levy = more strength from faction before they can DoW.

MAA is inherited, so that also goes hand in hand with having consistent high domain count so you have enough levies.

Make sure your dukes/counts are weak with only 1 county so they'll be busy fighting each others instead of you.

I'd also try to get dynasty members landed, for additional opinion boosts. Just make sure they don't have a claim on your titles.

To answer your specific question, it's typically better to use tether for Sanctifiied Mind. For one thing, the boss is stationary during DPS meaning someone can tether and then continue damaging with other weapons. The other problem with Sanctified Mind is that the crit spot from Divinity is glitchy since the boss rises up in the air -- it often won't work how you want.

These are the people trump hates. Trump also wants to get rid of abortion, and refund planned parenthood, which provides free vaginitis exams, breast cancer screenings, std testing, and free birth control, and abortions. That's what trump is against. Black americans who protest to replace the system that causes people with guns and tasers to best and kill innocent people for minor crimes or no crimes at all.

"fivethirtyeight","t5_2rxlz","Depends on the polls. More are better, sure, but higher quality polls with good methodology and big sample sizes do more than a whole bunch of crappy polls.

Unfortunately it isn't like *""Once we get the fourteenth poll then we'll know for sure.""* It's all about larger or smaller degrees of uncertainty headed into an election; fewer polls means more uncertainty. If you want to get a good idea of where things stand, I'd urge you to check out 538- they're simply the best polling analysis group out there right now.

As of me writing this, 538 is giving Alaska a 21% chance to vote Biden this year. Given that every poll listed has Trump up (anywhere between 1 to 18%), I'd say the fact that Biden's chances are as high as they are is largely a reflection of uncertainty. There simply haven't been enough high-quality polls to tell yet, and the fact that the existing polls are showing a tightening race indicates that people are currently trending more towards Biden and away from Trump.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Biden has lots of policies that benefit the working class and progressive ideas. 

Free public college and university for anyone making less than $125k. 

Raising minimum wage to $15 an hour. 

Paid family leave. 

Lowering Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 (first time lowered since Johnson passed Medicare in his Great society). 

Medicare public option for everyone under 60 but older than 18. 

And he wants to spend $2 TRILLION to fight climate change (a larger spending proposal than Trump's tax cuts). 

That's already plenty to accomplish in 4 years, if he can get half of it done.

Two notes on the MLE:

1. There's no guarantee we will have our MLE, just because we might not have the roster slot to sign someone with it. Really have to wait and see what's happening with Kanter and our draft picks.

2. If we do have our MLE then it will be really really valuable in this FA. 

 Pre-covid, only 7 teams had more than the full MLE available in cap space. Post-covid there just isn't going to be much money going around for people looking to move.

 This will be the reverse of 2016. Instead of teams having to dish out long expensive contracts to keep their talent, there will be teams poaching good players on short and cheap contracts. 

If we have the MLE it could really be a big factor for the top 6-ish teams racing to get better.",1601510595

She could see how the scene was going and how she was being set up and each time she walls out it's because she feels there's been producer and cast intent to  ""gotcha"" her and by end of season they stopped trying to hide the gotchas.

Now I’m not saying that’s what will happen to you, but learn from my mistake. If you think your relationship will end in marriage then there’s no risk to waiting a few more years.

A better route would be to figure out healthy, sustainable ways to improve your quality of life there. Maybe find a way to connect more closely to your friends on campus, or make friends with folks who don’t live on campus.

It's only unbalanced if, if you ever call them up when you just need someone to listen, they don't truly listen. 

The problem isn't necessarily that your friendships are imbalanced. It's just not the kind of friendship you want. There's no way to make someone be the friend that you want if that's just not who they are or what they want. 

Reduce the number of times you reach out to them for hangouts or small talk. Call them up every once and a while to vent, just like they do to you. Try that out and see if the friendships are worth keeping. If you aren't fulfilled by those little venting sessions then just stop calling them, and if they call you, apologize and say that you're busy. Or just don't pick up, whatever, you hardly see them anyway. If you do this the friendship will fade naturally.",1601510596

Maybe take a good look at that build again and read what is used for, there are different builds for different game modes, look uo some builds for pvp, wvw, fractals, raids and open world and know what's the difference between them.

First I would suggest you to read all of your traits, I've never seen how does it look on thief, but you should have something like ""heals per hit/crit"". If one of the selected traits doesn't convince you after reading it you could try to put the other trait and get some vampirism on your build, then if it's not enough look at the list of sigils to place on your weapons, you will sacrifice some damage but will gain a lot of more sustain.

I would suggest you to keep the zerker items for the time being, for a new player (or in general) it's not cheap to craft/ replace a full build, and I'm sure there will be settings where you will be grateful that you can fall back to that full dps, use the other template you have available in case you discover/experiment with a build that looks promising, first with exotic to avoid doing the same mistake",1601510597

If you think of other types of games, RPG, RTS, 1st person and probably many more, all of them require several game mechanics to even have a base to start with. Not that they would necessarily be harder to an experienced developer, there’s just so much more to think about from day 1.",1601510597

My grand dad hit medicare for ~$3mil in the last 2 years of his life because he was a 350lb diabetic that chain smoked most of his life with the worst diet imaginable. 

He was a school teacher that never paid anywhere close to that much in taxes over the course of his life.

We're the fattest sickest country in the western world, because people make very poor choices and somehow expect others to pick up the slack when they go wheezing into the doctor after making 2 stops at McDonald's.

When Americans can be trusted to take care of their own bodies in a minimal fashion, then arguments for universal health care hold more water.

But most of the time, the code is sitting right in front of you, but you can't understand it, you can't feel it, you can't understand it through your heart, mind or soul.

"languagelearning","t5_2rjsc","I'm a Brazilian studying in Italy. I wouldn't say language is a barrier (perhaps a small one). The HUGE barrier for me is the education system itself in Italy which is very traditional, teacher centered and heavily based on memorization and theory. Professors just arrive in the classroom, turn their backs to students, fill the board with theory or talk to themselves for hours... there is little or no interaction. Students only listen and write (imagine doing only that from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening every day of class). It's funny, Italian students try to write every syllable their teachers say... they are like copy machines!

In Brazil, even at university, I had a very different experience. We discuss a lot, do work in groups, pairs, we go together to the library, the professors come to talk to us, make us go to the front and share our discoveries with the entire group... Teachers usually preach knowledge should be about real life rather than robotic memorization...

All my study years in Brazil were like that. So it was a big shock when I came to Italy. Do I recommend? If you are ready to memorize a book with 600-800 pages for one exam, yes.

And no, I'm not exaggerating, I really mean memorizing 800 pages for each main exam. Look at this girl's tips to pass Italian exams: she reads each paragraph of her thick books numerous times, recites everything out loud, makes summaries... until she memorizes the whole books. In my case, I use Anki, I ankify my textbooks.

Anyway... if you are going to study in Italy, you'll feel the language is going to be the least of your problems. 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂

When the earthquake happened it started hundreds of fires that turned the city into hell.

People ran away in despair to the shores of the river that is located at the mouth with the Atlantic Ocean.

One of the largest Tsunamis in European recorded history  then hit the population that was seeking refuge in this lower area.

Before the tsunami came, water retracted from the river bed as it is usual during those events. People started to gather even more to see this phenomenon as they were convinced that these were all Godly acts.

As a moderator myself, I see this sort of thing as a bit presumptuous. I would not like someone coming into my subreddit, deciding that I need an FAQ, handing me a list of questions that I need to write answers to, and then expecting me to pin those questions to the top of the subreddit. 

For one thing, there are only two spots available to pin things at the top of a subreddit. Only two posts can be pinned as ""announcements"" (that's what pinned posts are called). It's therefore valuable real estate. A mod needs to consider whether an FAQ is a suitable use of one of those spots.

For another thing, posts which are pinned to the top of the subreddit (anything on the subreddit page which is the same every time you visit it) tend to become just ""background"" after a while. People stop noticing it. A pinned post is good for a short period of time, like if you're announcing a change of rules, but it's not good for a permanent resource.

For yet another thing, even the sidebar / Community Info isn't a good place to put information. Lots of people don't even see this - on apps, it's hidden by default, on the website, it's just part of that static background I was talking about that people don't notice.

I'm not against FAQ lists: on another account, I've helped create and design some extensive FAQ pages for a couple of subreddits. However, I've learned that *people just don't read them*. People on Reddit never look for an FAQ list (and it's hard to find if they try, as I pointed out) and they rarely search for previous questions like the one they want to ask. 

I've learned through actual experience in this area that the single best way to address frequently asked questions on Reddit is to program AutoModerator to recognise those questions via keywords (such as ""trap"" and ""offensive""/""slur"" for ""Is 'trap' offensive?"") and then get AutoMod to reply to that post with the appropriate answer to that question - like we've done in /r/AskGayMen for the question ""Would you date a transgender man?"" ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGayMen/comments/iqvyz4/gay_men_would_you_ever_date_a_trans_man_or_a/g4uir6y/))

You have to put the answer right in front of the person asking, because more than 9 times out of 10, they won't go looking for it. 

As just a general user, I've also seen this sort of thing happen a few times. Some helpful person decides they're going to ""help"" the mods, and the mods reject what's been done because this was never part of their plan. Or, even worse, the helpfulness never even gets *shown* to the mods for their consideration: the helpful person just creates an FAQ (or whatever) and leaves it abandoned in the thread, feeling better that they've done their bit, when actually all they did was waste people's time on a pointless project that noone will ever see or use.

So I want to know if /u/KillYourselfOnTV has actually discussed this with /u/CedarWolf, and has got their agreement that the moderator:

a) wants this list of frequently asked questions,

and 

b) will actually use it, 

and 

c) how it will be used.",1601510601

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","I realize I'm a bit of a dissenting option here, but I am not as bothered by you using the word analyst. That said, since it clearly is a dissenting opinion, I think you would take heed and consider not using that phrase since where you have it is completely unnecessary anyway. Job titles are weird anyway, and I'm probably not going to care too much about what you call yourself and more about what the job duties you write tell me. 

So for the rest, I read your comments. 

Why on earth if you have relevant other experience would you not include it? Unless it's a bunch of other temp jobs, who cares if you're resume is 2 pages? Imean don't go over board, but I would only cut expierence that has limited to no value.  Your other experience may have some of those soft skills that you are missing here. I work with people. We need people who can work with people.  You can teach people tech but it is much harder to teach people how to people. 

I also agree with the comments on your lists of things. (Skills and tools.) Ok, cool. You can name a bunch of IT/security related things but it tells me absolutely zero about what you actually know or how much you've used them.  If you can't figure out how to include it as a job duty of sorts or some other personal project example it holds very little value to someone reading your resume. 

If you remove the personal statement and use that as a cover letter, you should have enough room to elaborate on your skills or add more of your experience. You have another page that you can highlight what you missed in your cover letter (which should be relevant to the specific skills asked for in the job posting).

I think how you have the job duties laid out is fine and you are off to a good start. I think if you can take the criticisms from myself and others you'll be in a good spot to at least maybe make it past the resume stage if you are realistic about the jobs you qualify for.

Edit: Also, while there are some good guidelines to follow, ultimately you need to remember the people here reading your resume aren't the people hiring you. There is no universal 100% right way to write a resume that will guarantee you an interview. Some people will like some things better than others. It's why a lot of larger businesses will even have multiple people in the panel so there can be a more diverse view. 

Good luck to you.",1601510601

"Idaho","t5_2qtxr","Technically, Jesus wasn’t anything. Because he didn’t exist. However, if I was going to place his teachings and behavior conceptually into a governmental/economical framework, it would most definitely be socialism.  He chastised the money changers, he healed and cared for  people and asked for nothing in return. He indicated that it would be easier for a camel to pass through the eye if a needle, than the rich to enter heaven. He told people to abandon their wealth and follow him. Contrast that to capitalist Jesus, please.

They have a fair chance of being made from more primitive materials, like bronze or bone. A few will be made of something subpar but useful, like iron or silver. And then there are the weird items, the armors made from stained glass and the swords made from origami paper, being held together by little more than the enchantments woven by the whimsical wizard who crafted the object.

But the most coveted arms of all are those made from magical metals. They have special properties. Arms made from silversteel (which the elves call _mythril_) have the same mystical properties as ordinary silver, plus they're so durable that they get a +5 bonus on any item saving throws to resist being damaged or destroyed, and best of all they glow blue when they come near creatures tainted by Chaos and Shadow. Arms made from orichalc (the red gold of the mountains that the elves name _tilkal_) get +10 on item saves and glow red when they sense the presence of giants or genies. And the rarest of all is adamant (or _galvorn_), a black meteroite-metal that shines like polished obsidian with diamond flecks of starlight within it. Adamant arms get +20 on item saves and glow bright gold when in the presence of alien beings, such as mind flayers, Mythos abominations, and Roswell grays.",1601510601

They marketed the Vantage as a sports car, the DB9 as a luxury GT, and the DBS as a “super GT.” The Vanquish was designed to compete with Ferrari’s GT cars.

I sometimes go to prereleases with my brother, or we buy a card or two for our kitchen table commander decks. We play a bit of arena, too, but f2p. We definitly won't buy secret lair or anything like it.
Also, I never watched any Walking Dead and have no idea who the charakters are, so all I see is that the black bordered cards are a bad idea.

But.

I am a huge Star Wars fan. I love it, and I probably spent more money on star wars merch/... than on mtg. If they would release a Star Wars secret lair with cool cards for Luke, Ahsoka and Obi-Wan, I honestly wouldn't really care that them being black bordered is bad for the game. I would be happy to have a crossover between 2 of my fav hobbies, so I would at least see if I could afford it. Even though I would probably barely play with the cards. 

I think it just shows that these crossovers are effective for getting new people to buy these products. So i expect it to sell well.

The real problem is obviously that the cards are black-bordered even though the people that want the cards because they like the walking dead probably couldn't care less. They don't want to play with these in a tournament. This is obviously just money grabbing.",1601510603

I recommend hitting up University students studying game design. They all have games that they MUST finish in order to graduate (most games are never completed), and the offer of a free soundtrack is usually a no-brainer for them. 

Avoid posting \*free soundtrack\* offers in online groups, no one takes that too seriously. Even if you're early on, you're desire to improve and bring real value is valuable in itself.

If you want some feedback on your music you can drop a link here or DM me - I do this for a living so I can let you know where your standard is at.

Good luck mate.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","The answer is yes, they do think most of their audience is sufficiently stupid. They are also right. Most debates are won and lost on the optics (who made the other look / sound sillier, etc), than anything real or meaningful. People have a tendency to equate conviction, or persuasive rhetorical techniques, with correctness. It works. Try the Mo Hijab vs David Wood debate, for example. Content wise, there are many holes in Mo's argument. But he played dirty, he played to people's lizard brain, and you can see why it works. Nor is this limited to Islamic sophists. Try for example Vaush. He's become quite popular on youtube. Most of his shtick is making the debate opponent appear stupid, by speaking in absolute and conviction-laden statements, the same way Mo Hijab does (and plenty of 'oh my god, you are so stupid', like Mo Hijad). And people buy it. People are easily misled by appearances. And that is why these sophistical tricks will continue.

While the quick response time can be a sign of a site in crunch mode/trying to hit their recruitment numbers before a given start date, I think more often than not, it's a sign of a site that's prioritizing their AmeriCorps program in general, similar to what u/c0astline-kid alludes to.",1601510605

The real issue seemed to be that everyone who had worked on the original Squats was gone and those who remained had nothing to do with their lore. It seemed like they just didn't like them and couldn't come up with a good codex for them. One of the big names, I think it was Rick Priestly, did say they were toying with the idea and trying to come up with a way to make them re-enter the universe. They were considered to be one of the new standalone races they were developing towards the late 90's, alongside others like the Kroot Empire and the Necron Raiders, but those became Tau and Necrons. They then planned on making the new Demiurg, the new name for the Space Dwarves, a Tau auxiliary race, which they did in the Battlefleet Gothic game, but after that they just stopped.

The thing with using a YouTube series to correct mistakes is that if you don't know what those mistakes are, you'll probably have to listen through a lot before you come across something relevant.  The best thing you can do is share your recordings with someone who can give appropriate feedback; either a teacher or sometimes this subreddit.  Regardless, I think both of those channels are full of a lot of valuable information.",1601510606

There are lots of ways to volunteer if youre interested. You can go online to the nashville rescue mission or check out many of the organizations the provide a hot meal on certain days of the week.

We worked 6 hours but received 1.5 hours of bonus wages every day, to keep pay consistent with the hours we were getting before COVID. The 1.5 bonus hours per shift were taken away.  


Ultimately, this is what made me decide to leave. My health was already not great as a result of my work, but after that pay cut, I was making the lowest net pay that I've made in almost ten years. I had no reason to keep telling myself that it was worth my health suffering.",1601510606

It’s always a matter of strategy. You have too few workers, you build your strategy around that. You have too many, you build your strategy around that. And honestly, don’t think of it as a whole industry thing; look at it as a shop-by-shop basis and the project becomes a lot more manageable.

"confidentlyincorrect","t5_2cn1kk","While from a logical point of view you can assert that men can be virgins if/because they never had sex, there are quite a few considerations that make the question of virginity a lot more difficult to answer, including:

* What constitutes sex? Is it only limited to penetrative, heterosexual sex? If so, are homosexual men and women virgins if they've never had that type of sexual relations? What about heterosexual people who have never had penetrative sex but have engaged in other sexual activities?
* If a broken hymen is synonymous with a loss of virginity in women, does that mean that women with elastic hymens that don't break after their first time, are technically virgins? What about women who practice anal sex exclusively?
* Assuming that there is an objective measure of virginity, and that this measure is based on penetrative, heterosexual PIV sex, just how much penetration has to take place for it to count? Is orgasm a prerequisite? Lots of men and women go their entire lives without having penetrative orgasms, does that mean they're virgins?

...and, most importantly:

If these questions are so difficult to answer, and if, at least in cissexual men, there is no physical difference anyway, then *why do we care so much about virginity*?",1601510608

"fo76","t5_jrw25","Do you like Fallout 4? It plays very similar, biggest difference is Vats is in real tine, no slowdown whatsoever. The dialogue style is more like FO3 or New Vegas, where you have multiple options instead of mean/sarcastic/nice and your character doesn't speak. The building aspect of FO4 is basically identical to what this game has for building your base, minus the need to worry about settlers and happiness ratings. I've been playing since March, picked the game up when quarantine started and am still playing it now. I really enjoy it. While it's obviously a multiplayer game you can do almost everything in game solo, you are very rarely required to team up with people to complete objectives, mostly for end game bosses.


 I play on PS4 and it's still very much alive, you can have up to 25 people per server on at once, and I'd say the smallest number of people I've seen on a server at one time is about 5, and that's usually late at night. Some days it's packed. 

I really think it comes down to your enjoyment of the other Fallout games and how forgiving you are of Bethesda's bugs/glitches, which are present here. If you already have the game there's no harm in downloading it and giving it a go, as it's free to play.",1601510609

Know when you can start casting your vote.  Have a plan for when and where and if you can bring friends and family.  If you notice people unlawfully intimidating voters, call the police and let the authorized poll workers know. 

Remember, getting Trump out is just as critical as removing the GOP senate majority.  Vote for your democratic senator as well.  Even wall street agrees that a blue wave is going to be a boon to our economy, not least race relations, global relations, climate action and health care.  Help ditch Mitch.

She ended up getting completely hooked on it, and had already ripped through an entire character before we started streaming. 

Since then we've been able to talk to some really cool people, interact with our friends during the lock-down, and even bake! It's been a great way to connect.

What is my perfect crime? I break into Tiffany’s at midnight. Do I go for the vault? No, I go for the chandelier. It’s priceless. As I’m taking it down, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It’s her father’s business. She’s Tiffany. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come, and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don’t trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son, and he’s the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Tiffany to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She’s been waiting for me all these years. She’s never taken another lover. I don’t care. I don’t show up. I go to Berlin.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","I think what people tend to forget is that the sorting hat isn't just sorting you based on who you are, but also takes into account what you could become. I think right from the get go Peter had potential for bravery and greatness. But the future is not a straight, clear line. At some point he chose the path of cowardice and villainy rather than heroism and valor. In this way, I think he and Neville are kind of like two sides of the same coin. They both lacked confidence but admired it in others. They were both scared of many things. They both had friends who were more popular and talented than themselves. The difference is that when their character was tested, Neville rose to the challenge and found himself more capable than he ever expected to be, while Wormtail caved to the pressure and fear and chose selfishness over righteousness. Either one of them could have gone the other direction. They both had similar potential, but because of their own choices, Neville became a hero while Wormtail became a slave to evil.",1601510612

To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

The pope crowning you doesn't mean you are roman, it is the fact that he is Pontifex Maximus, a title held by Julius Caesar, that he can give at least some legitimacy to the ""Roman"" claim, that is not to say this claim is unshakeable, I find it the weakest of the 3, but imo it is enough, especially by the standards of the time.

1. Sales figures aren't a counterpoint to an argument about perceived quality. That's the same as claiming Kim Kardashian is talented because she's rich. The two things are entirely independent, and not always indicative of one another. 
2. Use/fun/value for dollar are subjective measurements. Your opinion of the value or use of something is not measurable, tangibly. He wants this response, because he can double down and make you respond emotionally.

This dude probably sees the switch for what it is beyond the Nintendo label and exclusive game library, a cheap, underpowered, undersized tablet. He wants you to engage him with your feelings, and beat you down with tech specs to make his point.

I feel this haha. I've been reading a lot too but can only apply so much information without first-hand experience, guess that's where a coach comes into play. 

I've been trying to get 5 days of cycling in, but yeah maybe depending on the week I'll do four and move that Friday strength training a day early... I really try to keep the Wednesday easy ride as easy as possible, but it's hard cause I don't live in the flattest area. 

I don't usually feel too bad after weights but I also don't have the most actual weight to utilize (only have 25lbs including a barbell), so it's more reps and workout it seems sometimes than muscle tearing. 

Guess I need a coach for real if I want to make the best schedule.",1601510615

Cities and counties can also levy sales tax in most states, which generally you can’t be exempted from if you’re buying items in that jurisdiction, even if you’re a tax exempt organization. For example, I worked for a state university, so most business purchasing I did I was required to present my tax exempt certificate and make sure I was not charged state sales tax.

"TrueOffMyChest","t5_2yuqy","Hey OP, as someone who has come from a very humble background and is pursuing my dreams with the belief that luck won't completely define my future, I'd love to get your insight on a few points.

I've heard studies that successful businesses/people tend to have the same amount of ""lucky"" opportunities as unsuccessful ones, and that the defining factor was how prepared they were to take advantage of those opportunities and how willing they were to take on the opportunity vs stay in their comfort zone. I can't remember which book I read that stated this so it might be complete BS, but the idea is certainly logical.

A few of your steps to success were contributed to luck/personality but I feel that hard work has been underplayed. I'm going to bold the parts where I see hard work that has been underplayed.

* I decided what I wanted to do at a ridiculously young age and **focused only on that** (specific personality)
* I laid out a plan to get there when I was 14 and **followed it to a tee** (specific personality)
* I managed to get into a very exclusive program that allows high school seniors to **work internships 4 days out of the week for 75% of the year**, only available at 5 schools in New York (luck)
* At that program, my teacher would not let me settle. Because of that amazing teacher **I made SEVENTY cold calls, wrote THIRTY emails and and lied about my age** to get my first internship. (luck)
* **I made another 44 cold calls and a little over 20 emails** for my next step (specific personality)
* **I got another internship** in California (not possible without previous instances of luck)

So yes, luck played a part in you getting the specific opportunities you had, but the way I see it these doors couldn't have been opened to you without a lot of focus and dedication during and beforehand.

Hard work alone isn't going to make you successful, I agree with you on that. My dad is a great example of this, where he works harder than anyone I know, yet struggles financially. I think the key point I'm getting from this post is to do calculated work rather than just plain hard work. Know what your goal is and work towards that. Make plans on how to get where you want to be.

You put in a lot of effort to get to where you are and I think you aren't giving yourself enough credit. Also somebody might read this post and blame their circumstances on bad luck rather than their lack of planning / calculated effort. Blaming your luck is a cop out and takes away your responsibility in the matter. Your success isn't anybody's responsibility but your own.  Anyways, if you had the time to read this I'd love to hear if you disagree with anything I've said as well as **why** you disagree.

Don't forget most autoattack steroids ADCs have starts cooldown on cast, meaning you get to use more AS/range/AD to get the cooldown back faster, and late enough in the game you may be able to have near 100% uptime on your steroid. In case of Tristana it would mean +110% attack speed permanently during a fight - with Haste just from this item it takes you average of 4 crits during 7 seconds window to get Q back up before it runs out.",1601510619

"TheGameCrafter","t5_3ot7t","Hi, everyone!

The TGC Community Anthology Contest AMA has officially begun! 🥳 Please feel free to post your questions and inquiries about the contest here directly, and I will answer them as I get to them.

You may be wondering why I started the contest, and there are a few reasons:

1. Community member Tony Vasinda joked about it when I shared a link to the Jumbo Coil Bound Book video TGC uploaded to YouTube.

2. I've always wanted to try running a contest. 😅

3. I've been thinking about a way to reward all entrants with something outside their contest submission.

4. I love seeing the varied, diverse, and colorful solutions the design community always brings to the table - so many ideas and concepts I could not have arrived at on my own.

There are a lot of ""I""s in those reasons, but alluded to in point 3., the reason why I wanted this contest is to truly foster the community and bring people together in a way that has not yet been done before.

Low-risk, low-cost, I intend for this contest to be the most accessible one TGC has seen to date, and with any luck, we'll get lots of your friends with little to no design experience included here as well, to proudly see their name next to yours. 😊

Have at it!",1601510620

&gt;The US is an immigrant country...

Hardly. It is a former British colony, hence why culture and politics are disproportionately similar to other western European countries and their former colonies like Canada and Australia. It was only until the 1990s that the US was less than 80% European:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_racial_and_ethnic_demographics_of_the_United_States

Likewise, historically the US never was an ""immigrant country"". It has always been a WASP country until very recently:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_and_Nationality_Act_of_1965

And this is the previous immigration policy:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Origins_Formula

&gt;There was no question of the racial superiority of Northwestern Europeans or of the racial inferiority of Southeastern Europeans. *It was simply a question as to which of these two groups of aliens is, as a whole, best fitted, by tradition, political background, customs, education, and habits of thought to adjust itself to American institutions and to American social and economic conditions – to become, in short, an adaptable, homogeneous, and helpful element in American national life.*

That has always been the sentiment, even post the 1965 Act, until very recently (~1990s). 

If the US was say, an East Asian based country with strong ties to Asia our language would probably be similar to Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and the like and not based on a European language (English - yes, English comes from Europe). 

&gt;And I dont believe you’re South Asian because you sound like a fuckin neonazi.

For knowing basic history about my country?

Oh my floof, the amount of love and support from this community on this post really has given me the motivation to pick myself again, clean up part my home and put a stride in my step when I went grocery-shopping this afternoon. I'm truly moved by all the positivity and I'll make sure to give equally as much back to you lovely fluffs. ;3

As for my former gf: after our last ever exchange I decided to remain her friend in the future and respect her for whom she is as a person as well. It's very easy to let frustration or sadness take over and paint her as some sort of villain who wronged me, but that would frankly disrespect the good times we had together that I want to cherish instead. I would probably hug her if I bumped into her at a con or on the streets and same goes if she's with someone else. We're all adults after all.

And the money and life being heavy... Well, c’est la vie. I just have to be wise how I go about both. I'm at least glad to see that there's a lot of fellow furries who are willing to let me vent to them and think along when needed, so that's at least a comfort to have.
Luckily the situation is not as dire that I risk being kicked out of my home or have to go hungry, so no worries there.

Again, thank you all so much for all the love and support. I already thought up a few new memes to make for this subreddit. ;3

Feel free to DM me – I'd love to make a few more furry friends!

I love you all! ❤

"southpark","t5_2qoqu","Ha, I feel like Butters Dad on people wearing their masks like that",1601510622
"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I don't know, but I suspect it has something to do with their servers.

I too now have this, I need to wait 1 minute. Restarting doesn't help.

**In summer I had this issue for whole \~7 days, and I needed to wait \~8 minutes** (I even suspected it was infinite). ""Check &amp; Repair"" didn't find anything, but it was frozen for several minutes at 0% (restarting didn't help). **After those days the issue disappeared by itself.**

I have mostly free 16 GB RAM, mostly free NVMe SSD ^((BTW, I regret saving $40 and buying 1TB noname instead of 970 Evo Plus because non-linear speeds are 2x worse, simult. read+write is 330mb/s instead of 700)), good 120 Mbit/s internet, own IP address, no NAT. There is no Battle.net process when the window is open; the window consumes 4% of 1 core, and 160MB RAM.

I met this issue both on Linux and Windows 10 (but on Linux I use all the same settings folder as in Windows, thanks to symlinks). On Linux I launch StarCraft 2 directly from *SC2Switcher\_x64.exe*, not Battle.net client. This .exe file launches *StarCraft II\\Versions\\Base81433\\SC2\_x64.exe* . Killing *SC2Switcher\_x64.exe* does nothing to the window with the progress bar. There is no Battle.net in background when SC2 is launched directly. I tested all mostly on Linux, here it's easy to check for stale processes because I've enabled ""Virtual desktop"" in *winecfg*, so wine (Windows emulator, or rather reimplementation of the Windows userspace) shows icons (.lnk) when any .exe is open. When nothing is open, *wine* dies and I see no icons.

The window (*SC2\_x64.exe*) has one open HTTP connection to a random IPv4 (e.g. 137.221.64.7 ).

I tried clicking ""Cancel"": window disappears, but the process dies only after the same one minute. Changing the system locale completely to en\_US.UTF-8 doesn't help (that's easy to do on Linux).

**UPD: I have tested again and it works fine now (although the window exists now for 5 secs, not 2 secs as used to be).**",1601510622

When you hit 78 or whatever the fuck he is, it doesn't matter if you're 300 million in debt. He has lived like a billionaire his whole life. This ""he's broke"" shit is stupid because A) Not true - he just manipulates the tax code (most likely, but not proven yet, in illegal or questionable ways) B) Who cares? C) if he was ""broke"" before - like.. Kanye when he said he was ""bankrupt"" broke... he certainly isn't now.

This causes a crossload situation as other devices like hdd's and other 5v and 3.3v devices are still pulling load. This crossload situation will cause voltages to go out of spec (5% deviation), which can cause undue stress on components. A decent psu will shut off if the deviation is too much via UVP or OVP iirc.

I've never ever seen a Criterion at any location (I try them all) for over $30 there for instance.

Their major box sets are the best prices I've ever seen for them in particular. Almost all are under $50 for extensive sets.

And HPB's convention center yearly clearance sales are literally how I built my core collection too, I never would have been able to afford it otherwise. DVDs are all 1 or 2 dollars, Blu-Rays 4 or 5. Solid titles. (You should google and see if/when they have these sales in your area, they are amazing. For books too, for many years they had all the books priced at quarter or 50cents there.

Excess property. Some of it comes from the feds and is distributed to the states to be distributed as they see fit. My local VFD rescue squad is currently using an ambulance that came from Cape Canaveral and was used as standby for shuttle launches.

HSBC 100k points can be converted into $500 cash - $49 annual fee is definitely a no-brainer for me. 

If you want flexible travel, I think the Amex biz plat is very worth it. 75k points on $7k spend. 75k is a one-way trip to Asia in business, or almost a round trip to Europe in business too, or $750 cash if you decide to cash it out. It also comes with unlimited lounge access (not sure how useful it’ll be for next year) as well as hotel statuses for your vacations / staycations.  $499 AF is a big chunk of money for a starter card though. 

A good starter card is the Amex gold. $150 AF and you get 30k membership reward points for $1.5k spend which is already 1 round trip within North America and more. Or $300 cash.",1601510622

As far as a solution to your problem I would absolutely not follow the advice given to you, immediately disable the card (like you already did) and report it stolen then immediately after call customer service and tell them you need your card asap because its your only bank account (they'll usually argue with you but after some hassle they can and will expedite your cards shipping.

What kills me is supposedly smarter people, the so called brain trusts, push for invasions and such and gloss over creating more suicide bombers, etc. Like after the Iraq invasion they had no plan whatsoever so W's admin just kept throwing crap at the wall to see what would stick. After about 3-4 tries they finally said 'well we (also) did it To Spread Democracy' and hacks for the dirty bastards ran with it. 

You even had these punters spreading manure in publications during Obama's years trying to push that W was a Great president, one of our best. Our boys (and women) were still coming back headed to Walter Reed in droves. Accomplished nil, nada. Took years until the next admin got Osama.

Also, the case they listed is in fact notorious for being an absolute furnace despite the fact that it *looks* like it would have good airflow.  
  
Lastly I have no idea why they're saying that Gigabyte SSD ""has a cache"" as though it means anything. The SX8200 Pro also has a DRAM cache, as it's also a high-end TLC-based drive. Whether or not the Gigabyte drive is even faster overall is very debatable, additionally.",1601510624
"NianticWayfarer","t5_26d5z6","That's tricky. Zoomed in photos generally don't do the best... Does the ""pedestrian"" side have any sign or name? Only other thing I can think of is describing more how it's accessed (eg. Parking is at XYZ and pedestrian trail can be walked from parking lot to the booth.) I'd also draw attention to the fact that there are benches by the booth for spectating. 

I generally rate announcer's booths (usually seen at sports stadiums) lower because they are not necessarily where people congregate. But the benches here show that this spot is for spectating as well.

Hope this helps! Good luck!",1601510624

If they are just sitting at a signal or wherever, not moving, then they are just being annoying.  I use to let my bike just idle at a signal, wouldn't even have it in gear or my hands on the handlebars sometimes.  The engine will just sit and idle as long as it's tuned correctly.  It's possible that sometimes someone's bike might not be tuned correctly to stay running, but it shouldn't be that way.

If they are starting to go, that's a bit differently.  Motorcycle engines rev up higher than car engines.  And they are more exposed, so they do make more noise when they are starting to get going.  Many times you hear harleys especially make big loud noises as they are getting noisy.  This is just the way it is, except they could if they want to get quieter mufflers, but most don't want to.",1601510624

My daughter is about to turn 11– so I have totally missed my window for being able to control what she wears (much to my chagrin). 

I have a ton of photos of her in liberal themed Obama baby clothes— but somehow never ended up with any photos of her in a Sox onesie.  

I was very distracted in October 2008 because she was being born, and busy after that because, well, newborn.   

So I guess my point is, they get older way faster than you ever imagined.  Propaganda the fuck out of them while you still can.

What kind of a kingdom would that be? Rather unfulfilling, I should think.

If we follow his instructions, we'll most likely be hated and killed ([John 15:18-21](https://youtu.be/4NTqbh1eB6M)), but it's through our testimony and our sacrifice that we will help others to become part of a different world... which is coming back to Earth some day.",1601510627

But yeah, basically this. I like how Trump said Biden wanted the Green New Deal and Biden was like ""no, I'm going to do the Biden plan"" which is basically a version of the Green deal that doesn't solve anything but looks better to the public.

The debate won't change anything and Biden had a few ok moments, but from the perspective of a person that doesn't know what they're talking about Trump certainly won the debate.

Trump was always on the offensive and Biden wasn't even looking at him  when he spoke, it was like watching a kid getting bullied. When Biden said things Trump questioned what he was saying, like the rude asshole he always is and with bad arguments, but Biden wasn't capable of arguing against what Trump was saying. When Trump said a bunch of bullshit Biden just laughed and said nothing, like, this is a debate, say something! He just told the Proud Boys to ""stand by"" you don't got anything to say about that??

It's a great thing all the people that watch debates already know who they're voting for, if all the uninformed people who don't know who to vote for watched that they'd be voting Trump.",1601510627

But because there's no replacement on the horizon, retiring B-52s would leave the Air Force (in its view) short in one of its core capabilities. So it isn't just that the design is so good it doesn't need replacing, it's that they feel they *can't* get rid of it without losing one of their primary functions.

 Statement

September 21, 2020

Ottawa, Ontario - Government of Canada 

“We thank the Assembly of Nova Scotia Mi’kmaw Chiefs for their leadership and for the open, respectful and constructive conversation today, where we affirmed what the Marshall Decision declared over 20 years ago – that Mi’kmaw have a constitutionally protected treaty right to fish in pursuit of a moderate livelihood. 

We share the concerns of the Assembly Chiefs for the safety of their people. There is no place for the threats, intimidation, or vandalism that we have witnessed in South West Nova Scotia. This is unacceptable. 

DFO fishery officers, Canadian Coast Guard vessels and personnel, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and Public Safety officials are coordinating their efforts in the sea, on the land, and in the air, and are working with officials from the Province of Nova Scotia to respond to any dangerous situations as they may arise. 

Reconciliation is a Canadian imperative and we all have a role to play in it. What is occurring does not advance this goal, nor does it support the implementation of First Nation Treaty rights, or a productive and orderly fishery. 

We want to work with First Nations leaders on the path forward of the implementation of their Treaty right, and look forward to upcoming conversations on this matter. 

This government is firmly committed to advancing reconciliation, respecting Indigenous treaties, and implementing First Nation rights, and we firmly believe that respectful, constructive dialogue is the way to achieve this. 
At this time we need communication, not confrontation.”

What this means is the government is working with individual indigenous groups to assist with the rights of those groups to fish, commercially. The conversation will center on the right of the indigenous to fish and the right of DFO to regulate that resource. What will happen is groups will be set up to fish all year, respecting breeding times by switching target harvests. Like it or not the 300 years of colonialism mainly keeping the indigenous out of the commercial fishery have come to an abrupt end. This is win win.",1601510629

"AskPhysics","t5_2sumo","Yes. Its not just for photons though. For any object travelling at relativistic speeds, you cannot use that momentum=mass*velocity. Instead you use the relation  E^2 = m^2 c^4 + p^2 c^2 to define momentum.

For massive particles travelling at a speed v, the momentum can be given in terms of velocity as

p = m v / sqrt( 1 - (v/c)^2 ) 

For massless particles like photons, the above equation doesn't make sense because the denominator goes to 0. In that case we have p=E/c from the above equation.

"halifax","t5_2r77k","&gt; I never thought I would agree with Whitman on ANYTHING but who are they to say what people can do with their own rental property.

The government? There is a critical shortage of residence in this province. People need places to live.

&gt; and how is this going to create more affordable apartments on the peninsula these people still have mortgages to pay so it's going to be long term but it's not going to be $800 a month it's going to be $12,13,18 hundred a month which isn't very fucking affordable either.

This will (help) cause AirBNBers to either sell or rent their residences long term. The increase in supply will drive price down.

If they also add an empty residence tax like vancouver, that would further increase supply and drive down cost.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Líderes partidários e congressistas avaliaram nesta quarta-feira (30) que o governo está perdido e tateando no escuro para encontrar as fontes de [financiamento para o Renda Cidadã](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/governo-anuncia-renda-cidada-programa-substituto-do-bolsa-familia.shtml), programa com o qual Jair Bolsonaro quer substituir o Bolsa Família.

 Os parlamentares reagiram às declarações do ministro [Paulo Guedes (Economia) de que não será utilizada ](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/guedes-diz-que-precatorio-nao-sera-usado-no-renda-cidada.shtml)sobra de recursos da limitação no pagamento de precatórios (dívidas do governo reconhecidas pela Justiça) para financiar o novo programa social.

 A informação tinha sido dada na segunda-feira (28) durante pronunciamento que contou com a participação do presidente Jair Bolsonaro, de Guedes e de líderes do governo e de partidos da base no Congresso.

 A decisão gerou controvérsia na própria segunda, quando aliados do presidente da Câmara, Rodrigo Maia (DEM-RJ), [consideraram a estratégia uma espécie de calote](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/tcu-e-congresso-veem-tentativa-de-drible-no-teto-em-proposta-do-renda-cidada.shtml). Eles criticaram ainda outra fonte de financiamento que seria usada, de 5% dos recursos novos do Fundeb (fundo para educação básica) para ajudar as famílias que estarão no Renda Cidadã a manter os filhos na escola.

 Nesta quarta-feira, líderes e congressistas voltaram a questionar a medida. “[O governo] Lança uma proposta sem pé nem cabeça em um dia e, logo após a [reação dos agentes econômicos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2020/09/ameaca-ao-teto-e-risco-de-pedalada-fazem-bolsa-cair-mais-1.shtml), se vê obrigado a recuar da péssima ideia de financiar o Renda Cidadã com um calote”, afirmou o deputado Alessandro Molon (RJ), líder do PSB na Câmara. “E continua sem oferecer alternativa, fugindo de novo de suas responsabilidades.""

  Na avaliação do deputado Zé Silva (MG), líder do Solidariedade na Câmara, a equipe técnica deve ter feito uma análise técnica e concluído pela inviabilidade legal da medida. Já o líder do PV na Câmara, deputado Enrico Misasi (SP), disse estar preocupado com “a falta de clareza e de unidade do governo” em relação à fonte de financiamento do Renda Cidadã.

 O deputado Arnaldo Jardim (SP), líder do Cidadania na Câmara, afirmou ser difícil “acreditar que uma equipe econômica experiente tenha sido levada a dar guarida a uma proposta tão prejudicial à economia brasileira”.

 “De qualquer forma, perdeu-se uma excelente oportunidade de apresentar um programa de auxílio aos mais vulneráveis e, ainda, de fazê-lo pautado em compromissos que levem o país à rota do crescimento econômico. E não ao populismo inconsequente”, disse.

 Paulo Ganime (RJ), líder do Novo na Câmara, elogiou o recuo e afirmou que Bolsonaro prioriza a reeleição.”Essas pautas de corte de gastos, reforma administrativa, são difíceis de explicar para a população, têm menos apelo popular, acabam conflitando com a agenda de reeleição”, afirmou. “Mas a reeleição não deveria ser o motor do governo, sim as reformas necessário para o país.”

 O deputado Fábio Trad (PSD-MS) afirmou que o recuo mostra que o governo está tateando no escuro. “Busca fontes de financiamento, mas não consegue achar a rubrica adequada”, afirmou. “O fato é que o ultraliberalismo do Estado mínimo vai aos poucos cedendo espaço aos apelos de políticas compensatórias de transferências de renda tipicamente brasileiras. É a escola de Chicago se desmanchando.”

 No Senado, a decisão do governo de desistir de usar precatórios para financiar o Renda Cidadã também foi elogiada. O senador Esperidião Amin (PP-SC) afirmou que a medida estava certa e que o uso da sobra de recursos com precatórios era uma pedalada. “Só tem um jeito, os que ganham mais pagarem mais imposto para custear os que não têm renda. O Brasil não vai sair disso se não houver solidariedade”, disse.

 Para o senador Renan Calheiros (MDB-AL), mexer na questão dos precatórios pega mal. “Parece que está querendo se eximir de responsabilidades"", ressaltou.

 A senadora Kátia Abreu (PP-TO) avaliou que a medida não poderia ter sido adotada “de hipótese alguma”. “Isso seria calote puro.”",1601510630

With the mishimoto intercooler it keeps intake air temps low which help drastically accompanied with the mishimoto charge pipes I get lots of airflow and the air intake temps are staying pretty cold,also very pricey another option is zzp, they have a intercooler kit that comes with charge pipes and puts the intercooler in front of everything.

1) Unmap your drive (stop sharing it).

3) Run the following commands:

    net use * /del /yes
    net use /persistent:no

*(this should reset your drive mappings to vanilla)*

4) Reboot your PC

5) Remap your drive (check the permissions while you're at it, of course)

If it doesn't work try running that process again but with a different set of commands:

    net config server /autodisconnect:-1
    netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled

*Those two commands are: 1st to disable auto-disconnect on shared drives after a period of inactivity, the latter disables the ""network auto tuning"" feature which sometimes screws sharings, especially on large transfers or heavily populated folders.*

"CrusaderKings","t5_2tgic","Yeah, I'm currently around 150 years into my tall bohemia playthrough and just had the most harrowing reign yet. My previous ruler suddenly contracted cancer and my thrice-damned court physician only made things worse. I had planned on disinheriting my oldest son as he sucked (lazy, arbitrary and deceitful with hale being the only congenital trait) and having my second son take the throne (Quick and Herculean, with temperate). Alas, I had pretty much no prestige and was unable to disinherit or kill him before I died. So, starting as him, apparently, for reasons I'm still not sure about, the pope quickly became my rival and excommunicated me in my first year of rule. Then, not long after, war was declared on me/my leige for the duchy of bohemia (I also swore fealty to east francia, though it ended up shrinking quite massively and now holds next to no land) I was facing and army of 6000 with my army being half that sized. Luckily, the one blessing I had was that I had around 1000 gold in the bank, and so using mercenaries, mountains, and the fact that all my counties were near maxed defense, I managed to repel the invaders. Also, my liege was no help at all. Her only contribution being to have her heir be captured, losing me 50 warscore. I have gone much further into this guys reign, and while it has still been a very bumpy road, he has done well enough, getting himself independence when the bohemia kingdom split off and ultimately conquering a duchy from Moyger Federation (who had around 10,000 troops) so that he could finally make the king of Bohemia title. This has definitely been my worst and most fun ruler to date.",1601510632

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't know that much about Catholic-specific reasons, but here are some scriptures that encourage us to gather together:  


""Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering; (for he is faithful that promised;) And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works: Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries."" Hebrews 10:23-27

""Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God."" Colossians 3:16

""For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them.” - Matthew 18:20

""And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."" - Matthew 16:18

Matthew 16:18 sets up Peter as a foundation for the church, so then when you look at what Peter actually did to found the church you see some guidelines about how churches ought to be:

""And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. And all who believed were together and had all things in common. And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts... "" Acts 2:42-47

""On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight."" - Acts 20:7

""You yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."" - 1 Peter 2:5

But as usual, I think if you want a deep understanding of something you should read through the scripture as a whole. In this case, the whole new testament will help give you appropriate sense of timeline/context, which is better than having a bunch of scriptures semi-randomly selected to illustrate a point.",1601510633

It's a lot of peoples first printer and it was marketed as an easy printing solution, which is only true for people with some experience, there were similar problems back when the media was portraying 3d printing as a hassle-free home fabricator in its infancy 5-10 years ago and the hype didn't live up to the expectation.

"MinecraftDungeons","t5_p7blc","It has to do with where you want to stand and how you want to engage the mobs and monsters.   Grabbing both means your are going to try and do a combination of both.   In practice this means unrealized DPS on targets and wasted enchantment slots for 50% of your engagements.

Rushing into a room to get yourself surrounded to maximize swirling requires a specific gear or artifact layout in order to survive.   If not you have to rush in - smash a little - then run around in circles to prevent from being overwhelmed and killed.  Go watch the Meme videos on youtube.   Very rarely are they ever inside swirling range.   If they are in swirling range it's because they are in a coridor and mobs are funneling in, meaning monsters were able to walk straight up to him because he couldn't kill fast enough.

They also have this mentality that because they have swirling - they can just rush right into the middle of the room, and let gravity handle the rest, but that quickly devolves into them backing out after only a few kills because they get overwhelmed.   They just fall back on staying at range with their wave procs to kill 80% of the mobs out there.

They would have more DPS and efficiency in both positioning and safety - if they just stuck to their prefered plan of using wave.  Why?  Because their kit and armor are not set up for point blank engagements.   Speed Swirling builds usually rely on gravity on both their armor and weapon (to maximize pulls), and a smidge of survivibility on their bar (Like the Defensive amulet, or Life Leech on the armor, or an animus bow).   Your bow, or a lightning rod handles the alpha against those one or two mobs you know you can't hit stun and swirl to death.

It's wasted DPS, and encourages you to try and split focus your build.   Are you a mid range wave mechanic?  Or a point blank blitzer?   Try to do both and your build will suffer - either in survivability or clear speed.

In perspective take a pickax with 1555 damage a swing on contact.  Wave comes in at 1451 damage and swirl at 1866 damage.

Swirl: In this case committed at point blank range out performs wave by 104 damage a hit.  If you find that your able to move from mob group to mob group fast enough - frenzied (50% attack speed for 15 seconds) out performs wave by 1970 damage to the point of impact, or 415 damage for those monsters your still pulling only into swirl range.

Similar - but less dramatic results with wave, but wave is directional and you can typically hit more mobs in one go - arn't pulling mobs in to face glomp you into oblivion if you miss click, and if your at range - swirling is dealing zero damage anyhoot.   You can grab your bow with a soul quiver for additional pushback to play a little safer and grab more utility on your bar than survivability.

Basically - if you grab swirling - build for swirling - if not, all your doing is making your attack animation really pretty for 80-90% of your fights.   Is your intent to kill them out there?  Or do you want to kill them at point blank range?  Pick one, and optimize for it.  If not, your loosing out on 30-50% of your DPS in the vast majority of your engagements, and your kit is is now chok full of ""Gimmie"" stuff to cover for the set up's inadequacy.",1601510633

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," Um magistrado levemente conservador e que, nos últimos dois anos, ajustou seu discurso e se alinhou à visão do presidente Jair Bolsonaro em temas de comportamento.

 Assim pessoas próximas ao juiz federal [Kássio Nunes](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/09/favorito-ao-stf-e-gesto-de-bolsonaro-ao-nordeste-e-tem-chancela-de-lider-do-centrao.shtml), 48, descrevem o favorito do chefe do Executivo a preencher a próxima vaga no STF (Supremo Tribunal Federal) no lugar do decano Celso de Mello.

 A modulação no discurso, segundo interlocutores do magistrado, buscava pavimentar seu caminho ao STJ (Superior Tribunal de Justiça), mas ele surpreendeu positivamente nas conversas e, então, seu nome passou a ser considerado para o [Supremo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/colunas/monicabergamo/2020/09/bolsonaro-diz-a-ministros-do-stf-que-escolheu-desembargador-kassio-nunes-para-vaga-de-celso-de-mello.shtml).

 Tido como um juiz bem relacionado politicamente, Kássio conta com o aval do ministro Gilmar Mendes e, chegando à corte, deve reforçar o [movimento contrário à Operação Lava Jato](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/09/lava-jato-preve-derrotas-e-anulacao-de-delacoes-com-troca-na-presidencia-do-stf.shtml).

 Kássio é juiz do TRF-1 (Tribunal Regional Federal da 1ª Região) desde 2011 e chegou ao cargo nomeado pela ex-presidente [Dilma Rousseff](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha-topicos/dilma-rousseff/) (PT), graças à proximidade com caciques políticos do MDB e do PP, incluindo o senador Ciro Nogueira (PP-PI).

  Preencheu vaga reservada aos advogados —o quinto constitucional. Recebeu o apoio do então presidente da OAB (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil), Marcus Vinícius Furtado Coelho, e do atual governador do Distrito Federal, [Ibaneis Rocha](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/06/pm-sabia-que-haveria-ataque-ao-supremo-e-nao-fez-nada-diz-governador-do-df.shtml) (MDB), à época chefe da OAB local. Após a indicação da ordem, foi o mais votado em lista tríplice.

 Até então desconhecido no mundo jurídico de Brasília, ele chamou a atenção dos integrantes mais antigos do tribunal federal, que o elogiam por sua atuação como magistrado. Colegas dizem que ele tem coragem suficiente para enfrentar a Lava Jato, sem ceder à pressão da opinião pública.

 Antes do TRF-1, Kássio atuou como juiz do TRE (Tribunal Regional Eleitoral) do Piauí, de 2008 a 2011. Neste período, participou do julgamento que aprovou as contas eleitorais de [Ciro Nogueira](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2020/05/bolsonaro-vai-dar-comando-de-fundo-bilionario-da-educacao-a-assessor-de-ciro-nogueira-do-pp.shtml) na campanha ao Senado em 2010.

 Na ocasião, a Procuradoria Eleitoral apontou irregularidades nas contas do parlamentar —informações não declaradas à Justiça Eleitoral sobre o uso de veículos pela campanha.

 Interlocutores dizem que Kássio é bom no trato pessoal e pertence à ala garantista do direito, que privilegia a presunção de inocência dos investigados e se opõe ao grupo punitivista, no qual se enquadra a atuação da Lava Jato.

 Em entrevistas como juiz federal, Kássio já deixou claro que tem visões opostas à Lava Jato. Para ele, a [execução de pena após condenação de segunda instância](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/10/veja-as-idas-e-vindas-do-stf-sobre-prisao-apos-2a-instancia.shtml), que levou o ex-presidente Lula (PT) à prisão, não é automática.

 Como a jurisprudência do Supremo de determinar o cumprimento de pena após o fim do processo foi decidida por 6 a 5, a eventual nomeação de alguém contrário a essa tese ([caso do ex-ministro Sergio Moro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2019/12/decisao-do-supremo-sobre-2a-instancia-piorou-percepcao-sobre-corrupcao-diz-moro.shtml)) poderia reverter o entendimento do tribunal a respeito.

 Mudar esse entendimento para permitir o cumprimento de pena após decisão de segundo grau daria força novamente à operação. E desagradaria boa parte do mundo político, incluindo caciques do MDB e do PP alvos da Lava Jato.

 Contraria também Bolsonaro, uma vez que a operação foi responsável por dar notabilidade a Moro, que se tornou seu adversário após [pedir demissão](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/sergio-moro-o-juiz-da-lava-jato-anuncia-sua-demissao-do-governo-bolsonaro.shtml) do Ministério da Justiça com [acusações](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2020/04/ao-anunciar-demissao-moro-critica-interferencia-de-bolsonaro-na-pf-e-destaca-autonomia-em-gestoes-do-pt.shtml) contra o chefe do Executivo.

 A visão de Kássio sobre o tema anima os caciques do MDB que o ajudaram a chegar ao TRF-1. Quando foi indicado, a então presidente Dilma Rousseff ainda tinha proximidade com seu vice, Michel Temer (MDB), que foi decisivo na escolha.

 O ex-presidente José Sarney, o senador Renan Calheiros e o ex-senador Romero Jucá, todos do MDB, também deram apoio à indicação.

 Além do centrão, o apoio a Kássio também parte de advogados reconhecidos em Brasília e que defendem os principais políticos do país.

 [Antônio Carlos de Almeida Castro](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/autores/antonio-carlos-de-almeida-castro-kakay.shtml), conhecido Kakay, defensor de parlamentares como Ciro Nogueira e Jucá nas investigações da Lava Jato, saiu em defesa do nome que desponta como favorito para o STF.

 “Quando o doutor Kassio Nunes foi nomeado desembargador federal pela Dilma a notícia foi que ele ‘um homem do Wellington Dias’, do PT do Piauí”, disse Kakay.

 “Querem dizer que ele, nomeado ministro do Supremo pelo Bolsonaro, é uma nomeação do Ciro Nogueira, piauiense e do centrão. Ao invés de dar ao futuro ministro poderes de unir o PT e o centrão, é mais honesto ver o simples: ele está à altura do cargo de ministro do Supremo.”

 Em decisão que beneficiou o governo, Kássio acolheu um parecer da AGU (Advocacia-Geral da União) para liberar o [abate de jumentos](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2018/12/justica-da-bahia-proibe-abate-de-jumentos-para-a-asia-apos-denuncia-de-maus-tratos.shtml) para exportação. O juiz federal afirmou que o abate de jumentos segue os mesmos procedimentos de frigoríficos de bois, cabras e porcos e está amparado por normas legais.

 Foi dele também a derrubada de liminar da primeira instância que havia suspendido licitação do STF para a contratação de bufê para o fornecimento de refeições, com menu que incluía lagosta. A compra gerou repercussão negativa, e a decisão de primeiro grau ajudou a desgastar a imagem da corte.

 O magistrado tem mestrado na Universidade de Lisboa, onde faz doutorado. Especialistas na área, no entanto, afirmam que ele tem uma carreira acadêmica pouco expressiva.

 No TRF-1, Kássio se destacou por transitar bem nas mais diferentes correntes internas da corte. É bem visto, por exemplo, tanto pelo juiz federal Néviton Guedes, que tem 55 anos e chegou ao tribunal em uma vaga destinada a membros do Ministério Público, quanto por Olindo Menezes, que é juiz há 38 anos, está no TRF-1 há 25 anos e é da chamada velha guarda da corte.",1601510634

Svalbard ""When I Die, Will I Get Better""

2020 Translation Loss Records (#TL1641-V1)

Neon Violet, Orange and White Three Colour Merge with Splatter variant 

Limited /350


-----

I keep wanting to put a question mark at the end of the title, and it's bugging the hell out of me that they didn't use one.

Svalbard is a nifty little band. According to their Discogs description they are --

&gt;Crust, post-hardcore &amp; black metal.

The only part of that I take issue with is ""crust"". ""Crust"" is the new ""grind"", a descriptive term being used by people who have no idea what it means to things that they don't understand. If you can't tell what the band smells like through the picture, it ain't crust. And Svalbard looks like they shower.

Anyways, I went off on a bit of a tangent there. I'm just really passionate about crust apparently. Back to the record.

Initial impression is the positive. Great artwork (love the style) in a nice high quality 350 gsm weight sleeve. A fantastic variant as well (and defintiely the one that's taken me the longest to type out) which is what drew me in. I'm pretty active in that super cool ^^not IG vinyl community so I saw this come up a lot and having had bought their last album on CD a couple years back I knew the name and had a rough idea what they were about (though I remember being underwhelmed). This is definitely a step up from that.

One thing that does stick out to me though is that they're actually pretty bad at naming songs (""Click Bait"" .... seriously ?) and the last album had the same problem.

Musically I'm actually quite enjoying this album. ""Black Metal"" is a but of a stretch, but there is a black**-ened** feel to it. It's like .... Melodic hardcore mixed with post black metal I guess ? The (screaming) singer kinda reminds me of the dude from The Devil Wears Prada, which is a voice I've always liked.

The production is nice too.  Very clean and modern, which I'm sure will help them make a larger name for themselves.

I can also 100% see them ironing for Deafheaven in the future. So take that as you will.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;I understand that Serbia wishes to join the EU, and that the US is helping to legitimize Serbia's image to encourage the EU to allow sponsorship.

No, this has nothing to do with ""image."" The EU has certain standards they require for countries to join. It's not about image, it's about meeting those standards. And the position of the US has very little to do with trade goods, outside of having a giant trade block as an ally is beneficial due to each country within that block, but instead is more about countering other countries (namely Russia in this area) 

&gt;Tax money going worldwide while theres homelessness in the States.

Homelessness will never be completely solved. Fortunately the liberal order we've created since WW2 has made us one of the most prosperous and powerful countries in the world. Hell, our homeless are better off than the middle class in some other countries. 

Not to mention, this is an absurd critique. The aid to Serbia did not prevent the US from providing aid to homeless people in the US. They're not in any way connected. There's nothing stopping the government or the states from implementing plans to fix these numerous crises, but hey, they're still not. Maybe it's not that simple. 

&gt;Because that'll be a powerhouse alliance.

The power the EU holds is in each country that makes up the EU. Each country in Eastern Europe that joins the EU is moving into the fold of the US as opposed to Russia. 

&gt;I acknowledge that we can't go back.

Why do you want to? Again, the US has benefited more than any other country in the world from this system! We've been the undisputed superpower for decades, we're wealthy, we have influence over literally the entire world that as of now, no country can match. You're acting like the US is somehow the victim of this scheme when we're the benefactors.

And it's not even just the US. The world in general is more peaceful and prosperous than at likely any other point in history.

&gt;Conservatism (and those under the umbrella) want to maintain-- which requires balance. We couldn't (won't) feasibly save 5c in budget for fiscal year 2021.

Who? Because any ""conservative"" I know of in power has supported exploding the deficit, increasing spending while slashing taxes. They're clearly not interested in maintaining. Liberals seem to be far more interested in maintaining, raising taxes to actually pay for their policies.",1601510638

"WayOfTheBern","t5_3ff8l","perhaps saying Trump is the same as Hitler is referring to Hitler's rise, speeches, and targeting of minorities. those people certainly would not call Trump equivalent to Hitler in terms of killing like the Holocaust. but Trump's targeting of minorities is very close to what Hitler did in his speeches as targeting of minorities in 1930's Germany. along with this, Hitler's fascism and fascism in general is already closely aligned with what the American right and Republican party have been doing for decades including with Trump. fascist states historically have privatized large parts of their economies, something that is an obvious goal of the American right and Republican party - to privatized as much of the economy as possible. it's not an extreme exaggeration or comparison

""Also the Russiagate stuff despite plenty of evidence of Russian oligarchs also giving big payouts to key players in the Democratic party either through family foundations or their immediate family.""

&gt;this has only been around for the last 4 years. American right wing and Republican lying has been going on for decades, especially around leftist policies socialism and communism. even calling Obama a communist/socialist/atheist has been around longer than Russiagate and is therefore more significant with likely more believers. I guarantee far more people think Obama was a socialist than Russiagate, or there are more people who believe more strongly that Obama was a socialist than people who believe strongly in Russiagate

""This is all a huge fundraiser for the Democratic party and based on exaggerations and lies or ignoring the full story.""

&gt;correct. but please take note that I did not stay specific to a certain political party. I tried to be specific to ideologies. right wing (economic)(American) conservatism, liberalism, socialism, leftism, communism. these ideologies are not inherently connected to any party, as a person with either of these ideologies can become the member of any political party.

very many Democrats are conservative, right wing, or centrist (American centrist, not international). many of those Democrats who would bring up Russiagate are more likely to be centrist or conservative Democrats rather than leftists. it seems to me that the further left you go there is far less lying

Russiagate is a Democratic party led narrative, not a leftist one

""On the surface, it's fucking stupid, but if you are a Republican person and see what MSNBC is saying about you, it's equally outrageous. In addition to the lies, it's a non-stop barrage of how evil, racist, and uneducated those dumb Republicans. Always voting against their own interests, even though the Dem party has been rejecting the rank and file demands for decades now.""

&gt;again, MSNBC is not leftist. MSNBC is very centrist (American) and more conservative. while they will say these things about Republican voters, MSNBC will clearly align closer with the agenda of the American right wing than they will with leftists like Bernie Sanders, as they use the same exact rhetoric against leftist policies. I expect MSNBC to lie and fabricate because they are further right, as a media outlet is a business only interested in making money rather than conveying the truth just like every other company (and is encouraged or allowed in right wing economics)",1601510638

"MachineLearning","t5_2r3gv","1)  Unrealistic density: yes, if a dataset has over 50% anomalies, that does sort of bring into question what is anomalous in the first place since by definition, anomalies should reflect what is not ""normal"" which means it should be rare. But saying that the ideal number of anomalies in a single testing time series should be one is also a little odd to me...if you have a time series that does not have a lot of data points and another time series that is very big should they both have only 1 anomaly?

2) In Figure 9, you show that the first flat portion is marked as anomalous but then two latter flat portions are not marked as anomalous which seems odd. However, this could honestly be due to some specific annotation instruction quirk we are not aware of. Take, for example, Numenta's insanely specific annotation instructions here: ([https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1\_XUjaAXeV3YlgwRXdsb3Voa1k/view](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1_XUjaAXeV3YlgwRXdsb3Voa1k/view)). It hurts my head to read them. These instructions were probably not used to annotate the dataset in Figure 9 because it is a completely different domain/source, but the point is that I think it is not so much the ""Mislabeling of Ground Truths"" as much as what is DEFINED as anomalous differs from person to person and from one set of annotation instructions to another.  

One way to try to deal with that is have a vast number of different annotation methodologies to form a benchmark dataset. This is hard...I see in Section 3 that you have tried to ask the research community for a wide variety of annotated time series which was unfortunately not very fruitful. Something that would make the annotated time series in the UCR anomaly archive more valuable I think is if we can also see exactly what sort of annotation instructions were associated with every dataset.",1601510639

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was sick for three or so days, but that's not all of it. I've had swine flu and covid wasn't quite as bad for me in comparison. Covid was also a unique experience on its own though, not something to look at lightly. I think what first came off as odd wasn't the fever but how badly it skewed my senses even weeks after the fever had passed; it destroyed my ability to taste, my balance was thrown off, my ears would not pop in changing elevation and the mental fog, oh God the mental fog. It was too hard to think, little tasks were exhausting. My heart hurt and I had a cough for nearly a month or two afterward. The cough and weezing was one of the worst parts of the ordeal, coughing fits always happened no matter what and would wake me up at night. Cough medicine usually helps me but it did not let up with covid. I lived on cough drops during this duration. I wasn't expecting three months later that I would get covid toe too, which was so itchy and there was NO relief for 2-3 weeks with covid toe. I didn't get tested because I got sick back in January alongside my coworkers at the vet hospital I worked at. I know it's covid now because of the symptoms and the relationship with the time I was infected.

Because hallucinations and fever dreams are so awful, dying with this sickness isn't ideal. It's really upsetting to know there are people out there who died under these terrible conditions alone in ICU. Please stay safe everyone so that we can fight this catastrophe.

Anyway, one of the co-workers from the vet hospital had a new born baby of like ~5 months hospitalized during this time. Also another co workers grandpa had passed away. But the sickness wasn't dramatic or thrilling otherwise; very few of us actually ended up experiencing the symptoms but all of us were definitely not social distancing back in Jan 2020.",1601510640

&gt;The London season is in full fling at the end of the 1920s, but the Honorable Phryne Fisher (she of the gray-green eyes and diamanté garters) is tiring of polite conversations with retired colonels and dances with weak-chinned men. When the opportunity presents itself, Phryne decides it might be amusing to try her hand at becoming a lady detective in Australia. Immediately upon settling into Melbourne's Hotel Windsor, Phryne finds herself embroiled in mystery. From poisoned wives and cocaine smuggling, to police corruption and rampant communism (not to mention erotic encounters with the beautiful Russian dancer, Sasha de Lisse), Cocaine Blues charts a crescendo of steamy intrigue, culminating in the Turkish baths of Little Lonsdale Street.

&gt;On her eighteenth birthday, Lady Truthful, nicknamed “Newt,” will inherit her family’s treasure: the Newington Emerald. A dazzling heart-shaped gem, the Emerald also bestows its wearer with magical powers.
&gt;
&gt;When the Emerald disappears one stormy night, Newt sets off to recover it. Her plan entails dressing up as a man, mustache included, as no well-bred young lady should be seen out and about on her own. While in disguise, Newt encounters the handsome but shrewd Major Harnett, who volunteers to help find the missing Emerald under the assumption that she is a man. Once she and her unsuspecting ally are caught up in a dangerous adventure that includes an evil sorceress, Newt realizes that something else is afoot: the beating of her heart.
&gt;
&gt;In Newt’s Emerald, the bestselling author of Sabriel, Garth Nix, takes a waggish approach to the forever popular Regency romance and presents a charmed world where everyone has something to hide.

&gt;There’s a new detective at 221 Baker Street
&gt;
&gt;Set against the background of 1930s England, Jewel of the Thames introduces Portia Adams, a budding detective with an interesting — and somewhat mysterious — heritage. 
&gt;
&gt;Nineteen-year-old Portia Adams has always been inquisitive. There’s nothing she likes better than working her way through a mystery. When her mother dies, Portia puzzles over why she was left in the care of the extravagant Mrs. Jones but doesn’t have long to dwell on it before she is promptly whisked from Toronto to London by her new guardian. Once there Portia discovers that she has inherited 221 Baker Street — the former offices of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. 
&gt;
&gt;Portia settles into her new home and gets to know her downstairs tenants, including the handsome and charming Brian Dawes. She also finds herself entangled in three cases: the first involving stolen jewelry, the second a sick judge and the final case revolving around a kidnapped child. But the greatest mystery of all is her own. How did she come to inherit this townhouse? And why did her mother keep her heritage from her? Portia has a feeling Mrs. Jones knows more than she is letting on. In fact, she thinks her new guardian may be the biggest clue of all.

&gt;SOMETHING DARK AND EVIL HAS AWAKENED… Evie O’Neill has been exiled from her boring old hometown and shipped off to the bustling streets of New York City—and she is pos-i-tute-ly ecstatic. It’s 1926, and New York is filled with speakeasies, Ziegfeld girls, and rakish pickpockets. The only catch is that she has to live with her uncle Will and his unhealthy obsession with the occult. Evie worries her uncle will discover her darkest secret: a supernatural power that has only brought her trouble so far. But when the police find a murdered girl branded with a cryptic symbol and Will is called to the scene, Evie realizes her gift could help catch a serial killer. As Evie jumps headlong into a dance with a murderer, other stories unfold in the city that never sleeps. A young man named Memphis is caught between two worlds. A chorus girl named Theta is running from her past. A student named Jericho is hiding a shocking secret. And unknown to all, something dark and evil has awakened…

&gt;He's b-a-a-ack! Despite their best efforts, Carter and Sadie Kane can't seem to keep Apophis, the chaos snake, down. Now Apophis is threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness, and the Kanes are faced with the impossible task of having to destroy him once and for all. Unfortunately, the magicians of the House of Life are on the brink of civil war, the gods are divided, and the young initiates of Brooklyn House stand almost alone against the forces of chaos. The Kanes' only hope is an ancient spell that might turn the serpent's own shadow into a weapon, but the magic has been lost for a millennia. To find the answer they need, the Kanes must rely on the murderous ghost of a powerful magician who might be able to lead them to the serpent's shadow . . . or might lead them to their deaths in the depths of the underworld. Nothing less than the mortal world is at stake when the Kane family fulfills its destiny in this thrilling conclusion to the Kane Chronicles.

One of those doctors died from the virus and the public forced the Chinese government to acknowledge the virus. Subsequently many Chinese officials in the region of the outbreak were fired. By the time information was being released in the media, the outbreak was already out of control. 

The US reaction was bad but had the CCP not suppress information on the virus leaking, then the entire world would be in a much better place. Also from early January the CCP stopped all exports especially of PPE and started hording such supply around the world, hurting everyone. I'm in asset management and I saw in real time the sudden drop in imports across the board. That was before this is considered a pandemic.

(\*EDIT by periodically I mean every month or two - don't put all your washed hair in a shoebox)

Some trichologists will offer trichograms or phototrichograms which are very good methods.  These are normally used in clinical studies.  You would have to pay a decent bit for this though.

Periodic photos.  Take notes on how you took a photo, iphone x on a tripod at eye level.  Then stand facing it 40cm away.  Use a halo light behind the camera facing you.  No other lights.  Use a credit card levelled against your eyebrows and make a dashed line with a pen.  Use that line as a reference point.

As someone else mentioned you can buy a dermatology microscope online to zoom in on your scalp.  Get a tattooist to tattoo tiny dots down the centre of your scalp every few cam from your hairline.

Really good stats in projecting Deni Avdija.


I wouldn't be hopeful that he will be a consistent three point shooter, because of his 53% FT shooting. If he ever develop a reliable three point shooting, then he will be in legit convo of being an all-star. 


But there are important stats to note, other than his long range projection. 

Interior scoring at 69% and overall 58% EFG are crazy numbers. Especially playing against grown men. This proves that his size will easily translate in the NBA.


Second is his isolation defense at 0.58 points per one-on-one possession. People can stereotype him playing in a weaker league. But former NBA and NCAA players, who were good athletes recognize his defense. He said that in the Mike Schmitz interview.",1601510643

The problem with the mavs was perimeter D not interior. Boban had a good series and Trezz didn't play defense pretty much at all in the playoffs, but it was the fact that we would not close out on shooters that made that series go as long as it did.

Now if you wanted to make the argument that they weren't closing out due to needing to help Trezz on D I could see your point. To me it came down to pure not wanting to do the work. Which again is a sign of a Bad and/or Weak HC.

With the Nuggets I 100% agree with you the interior D was decent with Zub and awful with Trezz. Offense was good with Zub and bad with Trezz. 

Combine that with the fact that the offense would die mid game like my old 1989 Ford ranger and you see why Glenn got shit canned.

"brasilnoticias","t5_3a1qf"," O Brasil registrou 876 novas mortes pela Covid-19 e 33.269 casos da doença, nesta quarta (30). O país, assim, já soma 143.886 óbitos e 4.813.586.

 Além dos dados diários do consórcio, a **Folha **também mostra a chamada média móvel. O recurso estatístico busca dar uma visão melhor da evolução da doença, pois atenua números isolados que fujam do padrão. A média móvel é calculada somando o resultado dos últimos sete dias, dividindo por sete.

 De acordo com os dados coletados até as 20h, a média de mortes nos últimos sete dias é de 689. Recentemente, o país chegou a estar em situação de queda da média (em relação à média de 14 dias antes), mas retornou para o patamar de estabilidade dos dados de mortes (o que não significa uma situação tranquila).

 A média ainda está em patamares elevados.

 Os dados são fruto de[ colaboração inédita](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/equilibrioesaude/2020/06/veiculos-de-comunicacao-formam-parceria-para-dar-transparencia-a-dados-de-covid-19.shtml) entre **Folha**, UOL, O Estado de S. Paulo, Extra, O Globo e G1 para reunir e divulgar os números relativos à pandemia do novo coronavírus. As informações são coletadas diretamente com as Secretarias de Saúde estaduais.

  Amapá e Roraima são os únicos estados que apresentam aumento da média móvel de mortes em relação ao dado de 14 dias atrás.

 Amazonas, Bahia, Ceará, Espírito Santo, Goiás, Maranhão, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais, Paraíba, Pernambuco, Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Norte e Santa Catarina têm média móvel de mortes estável. Os demais estados apresentam queda.

 O Brasil tem uma taxa de 68,7 mortos por 100 mil habitantes. Os Estados Unidos, que têm o maior número absoluto de mortos (206.825), e o Reino Unido (42.233), ambos à frente do Brasil na pandemia (ou seja, começaram a sofrer com o problema antes), têm 63,3 e 63,5 mortos para cada 100 mil habitantes, respectivamente. O Brasil também já ultrapassou a taxa da Itália de mortes por 100 mil habitantes (59,4).

 O México, que ultrapassou o Reino Unido em número de mortos e já contabiliza 77.163 óbitos, tem 61,1 mortes para cada 100 mil habitantes.

 A Índia é o terceiro país, atrás apenas de EUA e Brasil, com maior número de mortes pela Covid-19, com 97.497 óbitos. Lá, devido ao tamanho da população, a taxa proporcional é de 7,2 óbitos por 100 mil habitantes.

 Na Argentina, onde a pandemia desembarcou nove dias mais tarde que no Brasil e que seguiu uma quarentena muito mais rígida, o índice é de 37,1 mortes por 100 mil habitantes.

 Balanço divulgado pelo Ministério da Saúde nesta quarta-feira (30) aponta 33.413 novos casos confirmados de Covid-19 nas últimas 24h, com 1.031 novas mortes. Deste total de novas mortes, 486 ocorreram nos últimos três dias, e o restante em datas anteriores.

 Com os novos registros, o país já chega a 4.810.935 casos da Covid registrados no balanço federal desde o início da epidemia, com 143.952 mortes.

 O número de óbitos pode ser maior, já que há 2.466 ainda em investigação.

 A iniciativa do consórcio de veículos de imprensa ocorre em resposta às atitudes do governo Jair Bolsonaro (sem partido), que ameaçou sonegar dados, atrasou boletins sobre a doença e tirou informações do ar, com a interrupção da divulgação dos totais de casos e mortes. Além disso, o governo divulgou dados conflitantes.",1601510643

Been trying to buy a house for the past year but haven't had any luck, the housing market here is awful. In theory we could get an apartment but that would delay buying a house for a long time if the market continues to go up since savings won't be able to keep up if we're paying higher rent.

But ChromeOS is not like that; it runs an essentially mainline kernel, and the userspace software is essentially identical to typical Linux distributions like Ubuntu - ChromeOS uses dbus, Wayland, Upstart, etc, it's even built with Portage (Gentoo's package manager) as another comment alludes to. You can get a shell in ChromeOS and it's pretty close to a conventional, albeit bare-bones, Linux distribution. And it has great x86 support - I'm typing this on an x86 Chromebook right now.

You could in theory stick a normal package manager on top of ChromeOS and install whatever you wanted and it would work fine, just no-one does that because it's a hassle to use the ChromeOS toolchain to rebuild everything. Instead people typically use Crouton to make a separate chroot on the same kernel, or more recently Crostini - which is indeed just a VM, as you point out.

In summary: ChromeOS is much closer to ""Linux"" than Android is.",1601510644

This episode was more enjoyable to watch but as I've said previously I feel my attention waning. I hope this is setting us up for a good season climax and series wrap up. I find myself drawn to more if the details of each episode and the small interactions between characters instead of the overall plot.

Su metalbending herself some armor in the middle of the fight was my favorite bit I noted. Such a great creative detail and also shows her determination. I find Su a surprising character. She's a woman of many talents but finding her as a bad ass fighter was unexpected. But, she's also Toph's daughter, so that must count for something.",1601510644

The process goes exactly as you said, then after we've worked our way down that's the people we allocate rooms for on check in. Rooms with a view do not cost extra and are not upgraded rooms. Therefore who I give them to doesn't matter, although it is preferred to go to members, long stays so they're not staring at a wall for 7 days or maybe people who paid more when the rates were up. 

If you're a revenue manager, you should also know that we need to balance rooms daily and give upgrades to people to make more standard rooms available. After all loyal members and that have been upgraded we are still left with lots of upgrades that we've got to give on check in.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","It’s always hard when you fall for a friend. There are three main options:

1) continue being friends and try to chill out your feelings

2) tell them how you feel and hope for the best

3) take a break from the friendship if you don’t want to tell them but you also find it hard to be their friend because you wish it was something more. This is a tough one but an important thing to do if you’re gonna be honest with yourself and your feelings are getting in the way of being able to enjoy the friendship. 

It sounds like it’s new feelings. I’d say try to chill and see how stuff develops for a little while? 

Just because she can’t go out on dates doesn’t mean you two can’t be sweeties- there are tons of ways to stay in touch and spend time together that are way less formal than going on dates. The rule of “you’re not allowed to date till your X years old” is completely asinine and out of touch. I say this as a mom of a 15 year old. Like who are these parents? Do they think it’s 1950 and you’re going to go to the soda shop? It’s hilarious to me that they think they can control her interactions and feelings like that. 

As long as she feels comfortable and you feel comfortable then just let things develop. Let it be exciting and try not to stress. 

And if it turns out she doesn’t like you back try not to stress about that, too. It sucks being rejected- and it never gets easier. But try to remember that there are tons of people out there that you’ll meet who WILL like you, some of them you won’t like back and you’ll have to kindly reject them, and that sucks, too.

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","So, I don't see either of these concepts as all that advanced. For trains, the steam engine dates back to the ancient Greeks, while the rail system was originally used for horse-drawn carts. As for zeppelins, bouyancy is pretty simple. Once you start experimenting with gasses, it's pretty simple.

Manufacturing these is the larger issue. Rails are a lot of metal for a pre-industrial society, and that's not even counting the engine. Once you start using steam engines on a wide scale, you basically have everything set for an industrial revolution, though you can still limit the applications of this. Textiles was the main focus in our world's industrialisation. You could make non-industrial methods easier or limit the supply of industrialisable fibers. Maybe everyone is still wearing furs or something.

Material is the main issue with zeppelins, though here some dumbing down could be done. Hot air balloons were created much earlier. You could just scale these up to zeppelin sizes and uses. Some nerd will probably find a problem in that, but who cares? Alternatively, you could do a zeppelin frame with wood or bamboo, using leather or something similar for the air sacks.",1601510646

Donna wasn’t evil to make aubree cookies and bring them by,

Adam and Chelsea both cheated on each other and treated each other terribly, though obviously he was worse,

At least he is going to school lunches, and (maybe) that’s better than nothing,

Aubree still loves him,

We can’t judge Donna too harshly because she’s never been on TV and didn’t sign up for this, and we’re only hearing one side of the story,

Donna might have been justified in telling Chelsea to grow up,”

The final line he crossed was after the Kenosha protests where he shared a meme to social media that called the Kenosha shooter a hero. I blocked him from all social media and plan to never engage with him again. It really depends on what the view is.

However, I am one of the lucky people who have 4% interest rate on my car payment. With a 4% interest, I lose $18+ some change to the bank I got my loan from. Gas is relatively cheap where I'm at and my dorm is literally across the street from my work, commissary and the gym, so I may spend about $20/month +/- some change to fill up my tank. 

Basically, what I'm trying to say is that you need to calculate additional costs into owning a vehicle. Your interest rate is most likely gonna be higher than mine. Especially if you have no credit under your belt. The dealership will also NOT allow you to drive away if you don't have car insurance. I recommend trying to look around at various companies to find the one that works for you. Another thing to add is that insurance rate depends on where you live and your age. The older you are, the lower your payment will be. For gas, how much is it where you live? If you have a gas station on base, is it cheaper than off-base? How often do you plan to drive and what are your vehicles MPG? Another thing I notice some people forget is car maintenance. It's important to get it looked at annually and highly advisable to get it looked at before any big trip. Ex: My tires are due to be replaced soon. I'm looking at $400-$600 a tire. *cries because this was something I wish I had known about sooner...

There is a lot you have to calculate into your budget and it can be daunting. I would advise speaking to your supervisor and/or the finance department to help you out. Everybody's financial situation is different. Research is important and if you feel uncertain, even the tiniest bit, ask questions!",1601510648

It’s a tricky situation, I feel for players who have to cope with that but for my money even a loan isn’t wise. Some players manage to get over reoccurring non-contact injuries, RVP a classic, but for every RVP there’s a Phil Jones or Jack Wiltshere. 

I saw something that he played 9 games last season, even if we did get him fit, new league, new system, new teammates with a far more intensive schedule and different climate (I’m sure a frosty Mancunian morning over a brisk but pleasant Barca sunrise would tighten any mans hamstrings). Add to that our club doesn’t exactly have a good record at getting injury prone players over them.

Even for a loan there would be a fee involved alongside his high wage packet that we’d defo have to pay in full. Then you have us as fans who know he’s not the player we wanted, that’ll add pressure to him. 

There’s no amount of mental gymnastics I can do which allows me to think this is a good deal for us what so ever. We could quite easily end up with the same right wing options as last season but with another body in the treatment room and another bloated wage packet being paid out.",1601510648

Heterosexual couples largely get to skip these details because of established biological and social norms. When a male and a female spontaneously hookup or date, both parties have a general understanding of what form any sexual escalation will take. Unfortunately, because of the *same-sex* part of our equation, we have to establish our own expectations overtly and upfront to minimize disappointment with incompatibility. It’s awkward having to ask in the middle of a date and finding out too late that it’s not going to work out if you go somewhere more private. Granted there is a *lot* more to a relationship than sex, but it’s an important detail to include when we advertise ourselves.

Your husband is not only being unhelpful, he’s being hurtful. And it honestly sounds like at this point, you and baby would be better off without him. At least until/if he can figure himself out and treat you with the respect you deserve for keeping his child fed and taken care of (WHICH IS HARD FUCKING WORK!!!).

I(f 30) am highly annoyed by my coworkers( f 40-50). They talk nonstop and makes unnecessary comments to kind of compliment me but I find them useless or stupid.

I know I sound harsh but let me explain. I am Hispanic and they are both white, we are all american. I speak English like any other american. I actually think I speak English better than because theyre kind of country. 

Anyways....They make comments like ""oh you speak good Spanish"" or ""I love mexicans they are so fun""! Etc etc. It's not so much the comments but how frequently it occurs. Like Jesus Christ it's an all day thing. 

Btw I'm not mexican. I don't respond because it's like....is it really a compliment for a non Spanish speaking person to compliment my Spanish? I wouldn't compliment a german speaking german because I don't speak German. My opinion is worthless because I can't even guess what a german would be saying. 

Today I was speaking Spanish with another coworker because I need to practice Spanish, I don't speak it as much as I speak english. 

One of my coworkers continued to interrupt our conversation for silly questions like answers she could easily figure out of she just stopped and thought for 5 secs(like looking for an item that's always in a certain spot? Then out of nowhere she said out ""are you mexican""?? To me. 

I felt hot because I was losing my temper and I was short and said ""no"" but she could tell I was frustrated and didn't push any further. I and those and spoke to my boyfriend about it whose white. I told him about it and said I should've said ""what kind of white are you"" as a response. 


He laughed because he thought it was ridiculous which was exactly my point. All these stupid comments or questions. 

Am I being dramatic or am I wrong for being upset? How should I approach this in the future?

I think the problem with Clarence is that he was used as a screen time hogger by the executives and that came at the expense of screen time and development  for other characters including Fox.  I think the plot of the set up was Olan’s way of giving the finger to the executives who meddled with his show by revealing their favorite character to be a despicable traitor.  We obviously have not seen the last of Clarence so by the time he appears in a future episode he should have a lot of change going on in him and some elaboration on his personality.

"chemicalreactiongifs","t5_2u506","For it to condense at anything higher than 70 F (21 C), the pressure inside would need to be more than 854 psi (58 atmospheres). There is no way the pressure reaches that high in the bottle before the cork comes off. What you see condensing is the water vapor, i.e. a cloud.

And maybe you should google the ideal gas law yourself, as it only relates to pressure, temperature and volume, not phase change.



Edit:

Let's assume that the CO2 starts off at 21C (T1 = 294 K) and initial pressure is 6 atmospheres, and lets approximate that there is 3 cubic centimeters, though this specific amount won't really matter as we are doing best case scenario, an isochoric process.

nR = PV/T = 6 * 3 / 294 = 0.0612 atm cm^3 K^-1

What is the pressure if the torch were to raise the temperature to 300C, the boiling point of water at 5 atmospheres (T2 = 471 K)?

P2 = nR * T2 / V = 0.0612 * 471 / 3 = 9.61 atm

What temperature would it need to reach to get to 58 atm?

P2 * V / nR = T2 = 58 * 3 / 0.0612 = 2843K or 2572C, or about 1000C above the melting point of carbon steel, but by then, it's way too hot to liquify at any pressure.",1601510650
"Nuraphone","t5_4mj34","I wear them for about 8hrs a day when I need to and find them no more uncomfortable than 'normal' headphones. 

Reading between the lines, it sounds like you're trying to get someone to convince you to try the Nuras, instead of actually wanting to try them yourself. 

In my experience, if someone's half-hearted about getting something then they probably don't really want them. It doesn't sound like you really want the Nuras, so I think you should go ahead and get either the Sonys or the Bose - both have fantastic sound quality and are comfortable (or at least the previous generation of each that I tried were, not tried the MK4 or 700s). For me the ANC on the Sonys beat the Bose and all signs point to it being the same for this new generation.

"suggestmeabook","t5_31t41","""A Passage to India"" by E. M. Forester. 

""A Passage to India (1924) is a novel by English author E. M. Forster set against the backdrop of the British Raj and the Indian independence movement in the 1920s. It was selected as one of the 100 great works of 20th century English literature by the Modern Library[1] and won the 1924 James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction.[2] Time magazine included the novel in its ""All Time 100 Novels"" list.[3] The novel is based on Forster's experiences in India, deriving the title from Walt Whitman's 1870 poem ""Passage to India"" in Leaves of Grass.[4][5]

The story revolves around four characters: Dr. Aziz, his British friend Mr. Cyril Fielding, Mrs. Moore, and Miss Adela Quested. During a trip to the fictitious Marabar Caves (modeled on the Barabar Caves of Bihar),[6] Adela thinks she finds herself alone with Dr. Aziz in one of the caves (when in fact he is in an entirely different cave), and subsequently panics and flees; it is assumed that Dr. Aziz has attempted to assault her. Aziz's trial, and its run-up and aftermath, bring to a boil the common racial tensions and prejudices between Indians and the British who rule India.""",1601510651

Laughing Cow mac and cheese —

- 28 grams elbow pasta - 100 calories
- 1 white cheddar Laughing Cow triangle - 30 calories
- 2 teaspoons (5 grams) grated parmesan - 20 calories

1.	⁠⁠⁠Boil your pasta according to the box directions.
2.	⁠⁠⁠Once it is done, save a couple tablespoons of the pasta water before you drain it.
3.	⁠⁠⁠Microwave your Laughing Cow triangle in a small bowl for about 20-30 seconds to melt.
4.	⁠⁠⁠Once it’s melted, add your Parmesan and reserved pasta water and mix until combined.
5.	⁠⁠⁠Add your pasta to the bowl and mix it all up until combined! Season if needed. I usually add a touch of salt and pepper but it doesn’t need much.

The pasta water create the sauce! Hopefully that cures your dry and cheesy pasta. ☺️

"Korean","t5_2rd8q","Both “아 강아지가 귀여워!” and “그녀는 예쁘네?” sounds awkward to native speakers. In many cases in Korean language, as you know, “조사” is not necessarily spoken. When they use a “조사” for a sentence that doesn’t need to have “조사”, it would imply something more than a sentence without “조사”. For example, “그녀는 예쁘네” sounds to me that “she’s pretty whereas other girls around her are not pretty”. If they say “쟤 예쁘네” (as explained below, they use “걔” “그 여자애” “그 사람” instead of “그녀” in spoken language), this simply means “she’s pretty.” and it makes sense as it without “는”. The sentence is not necessary to have “조사” to be a complete sentence. However, for “그녀는 예뻤다”, you cannot detach “는” because “그녀 예뻤다” is not a complete sentence. So, “그녀는 예뻤다” simply means “she was pretty.”

&gt;My comment is pointing out that the reason the Democratic party is more divided than the Republican party is because it has a more diverse membership, not because of behavior of people in the party. 

Diverse in what sense? Ideologically? I'm not quite sure that's true. I certainly wouldn't take a statement like that at face value - it deserves investigating.

Sanders, Goedert, Reagor, and Ward are all good offensive weapons. 

The O-Line is still very good, you seemed to forget that we have the best Center, Right Guard and Right Tackle in the league, in addition to an above average left side and quality backups.

On defense, Slay Maddox and Leblanc are all good starters at minimum. We have at least 3 good safeties between Mills McLeod and Parks/K’von. And our defensive line was is the best in the league according to PFF.

The only positions that you can even begin to argue for blowing up are Linebacker and Quarterback if Carson continues to play terribly. Draft picks and free agency are enough to account for age everywhere else.",1601510658

Online *and* in-person shelves for downy were either sold out or empty within 24 hours and Jungkook even ended up tweeting about how he’s gonna have trouble buying some for himself...it was wild.

"arabs","t5_2qt0d","&gt;can be. Arab is the unification of Semitic people, and later North Africa

the ancient iraqi kingdoms would refer to the people living west of the euphrates as ammorites (westernites)..when the babylonians took over they did the same thing and called them westernites..but in their language it means arabos or arabe something like that and they became known as arabs

the arabs themselves seem to be the descendants of the semitic people that lived in northen arabia and the levant ,these semetic nations opposed the assyrians  and the hittites and lost..and got their cities burned and were probably forced to go deeper into jordan and the arabian peninsula

it seems that their losses made some of them go deeper into arabia  ( nejd and hijaz) because they refused to surrender while those who stayed became citizens under the rulling empires

this is very evident in the assyrian empire when the assyrians would invade north arabia such as tabuk and daumat al jandal the arabs would go deeper into the desert and the assyrians could not go after them...heck getting to daumat al jandal was a problem

those who stayed in those empires that conqured had to live a nomadic life or live a rural life in some distant area or else risk lose their identity ( this is what happened to the itureans in lebanon and to the idomites for example)

the byzantines and the romans would even use arab vassal kingdoms to prevent the arab tribes from reaching the levant and syria again ..ofc untill the 7th century.

so you could say anyone who is of canannite-ammorite- idomite- old levantine/north arabian origin can be called an arab...(genetically ofc)

as for the arabic language itself..it seems to have originated in the southern levant (south palestine jordan) and northern arabia(northen hijaz) but we still dont have enough info on that

the southern semitic peoples of yemen seem to share the same genetics for the most part but there are some halpogroup branches that sprung in yemen and are actully from yemen(unique in their own way)

and actully modern genetics proof this..for example look here, a lebanese sample from a phonecian grave at the top and down are its closest relatives who share a common ancestor

[picture](https://twitter.com/TaissierK/status/1310881370517000195/photo/1)

2) take a cashiers check in the amount you want to pay (never full price) to the dealer that has the car you want
3) test drive and act interested offer to buy and flash the cashiers check
4) they will haggle you to pay more but be firm; it’s good to have someone with you so when you’re ready to “walk away” they can say, “but we’ve already been so many places...” (good cop bad cop kind of thing) 
5) if you do walk, they might call you in a couple days to try to get the deal done
6) you could offer the extra cash if you have to, buy literally every single car my bf bought has been from a dealer in that exact fashion. Occasionally the sales person is pissed because they let it go for so low - the check price always includes taxes and fees.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","&gt;Fast charging doesn’t degrade battery capacity nowadays, as well as battery nursing as that’s done by the OS

Fast charging produces heat, and heat degrades the battery.

Maybe less than in earlier phones, but it still does.

Yes, OS battery nursing has improved. But it still has its limits, especially during high usage needs such as 4K video (or more by now), 4G/5G streaming and PowerShare.

&gt; For people that want a replaceable battery or need it for their usage (maybe work related?) you can get a phone that has them.

Sadly, those *phones* are low-tier 1080p@30fps phones. Even eight year old flagships are better than them.

And the iPhone 6s only has 1715 mAh, meaning that the same usage induces a higher C-rate, this relative stress on the battery.

&gt; Tired of this back and forth, if you want a replaceable battery thats cool. But for others the tradeoff might not necessarily be as dramatic.

It is just that when I plug in my phone, I don't want to have that mind-boggling feeling that I can not replace that part once it expires.",1601510661

(I've been told that I have a nice booty though, lol) It was so depressing when they went away a week after I had my son, because I wasn't able to breastfeed due to medical reasons. It was like they disappeared over night when my milk dried up, which sucked so bad!

Part of breast size is genetics, and part of it is weight too. I've noticed that my boobs are much more full when I take care of myself by making sure I'm getting enough to eat. Honestly, there isn't much you can do besides making sure that you're eating enough, which I realize is difficult with an eating disorder, or opting to get implants.
