Though somehow feel he might be more keen on it if it was 400 years old, based on how I've seen him speak on other matters, though this may be unfair. It's similar to how the American constitution often seems too rigid to me though of course there are mechanisms to change it somewhat. 

I don't think Scruton is a particular fan of written constitutions; they're too top down.

&gt;I think he brushes off the economic arguments too easily. It might be fine for someone in a position of relative wealth and privilege but it may quite reasonably be the most important thing for some who struggle to get by each week or may not be able to find work in the future. And of course the standard line of economists always disagree with each other lol so don't listen too them is a cheap and lazy shot, especially with the general consensus the profession had on brexit. 

Yet those who were likely to suffer most also tended to vote to leave. These people aren't stupid; they know that a world outside the EU will not be one of milk and honey, at least not on the short term, and yet they still voted to leave.

"POLITIC","t5_2r84s","&gt;Well, if things are manufactured in China for low wages, with no environmental laws and no labor protection...perhaps that is bad for the world?

Nope. Low wages + low operating costs for the company means lower production costs which is why the price of technology is so cheap. And then you ask the Chinese worker who doesn't have to beg for money or barely survive in farm villages anymore, who can afford to send their children to college, and of course who are now forming the bulk of a new middle class in China, whether their lives have improved, and they will say yes. Because Chinese people (or for that matter, people in general) aren't so dumb that they work in crappy conditions for no reason and us Western Whites have to save them. They have plans and take actions to achieve those goals. So yes, that was good for the world.

&gt;That the main beneficiaries have been corporate bottom lines, and a culture of cheap, disposable consumerism?

I agree with half, that corporations are becoming too rich and powerful, and would support tax policies that target the richest people in the US (corporate tax rate here is too high compared to the rest of the world) who own those corporations. I don't think we have a culture of cheap, disposable consumerism, and generally allow people to buy what they want to buy without passing judgment. The fact that people can buy things for less money is a good thing imo.

&gt;I commented on your powers of discernment, based on the words you wrote. Saying that voters for both Brexit and Trump are simply poorly informed is sloppy, arrogant, and topically ignorant to boot - likely, you are not aware of what exactly is motivating them

I guess that's why I doubted your integrity, since you seemed to be calling me uninformed for no reason.  But yes, if you supported Brexit or Trump you are actually poorly informed. For the Brexit, all smart analysis suggests that leaving Brexit would spell at least a recession for Britain's economy, especially this idea that you can continue trading within the EU without having to meet conditions such as accepting free migration or adhering to EU regulations. Trump has few policy proposals, and is constantly lying or recanting those few policies (his most consistent policies have been the Muslim ban (""a total and complete shutdown on Muslims coming to the US"") that he has now been stepping away from). I can understand why angry people upset with political correctness, as well as racists (although not all supporters are racist) would vote for him, but they are voting based on emotions and not logic.

&gt;You, however, have nothing by which to base your assumption about my honesty or integrity; you simply made it up from your own prejudices

I was basing this assumption because you seemed to be calling me uninformed for no reason. But whatever, let's leave ad hominems out since they're pretty much retarded.",1467331207

They often cite the UN definition of genocide which includes ""imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group"".

The problem with this is that there's no evidence of some shadowy group intentionally pairing whites and non-whites together for this purpose. All the evidence so far points to...and this is shocking...that those who are intermarrying *actually love and care for each other*.

Scary, huh?

PS: Even if mass intermarriage did lead to the eventual disappearance of whites as an ethnic group, wouldn't it also lead to the disappearance of *every other ethnic group* as well? In the end, there'd be no race but one, and therefore racism would end. Wouldn't be a *good* thing?",1467331209

I've played evil characters in groups very successfully.  The trick is you don't use the alignment to be stupid and disguise it as alignment roleplay.

Parties can work together for the same goal without having the same alignment.  My favorite way to describe this is the princess trapped in the evil wizard's tower.  The lawful good paladin goes to save her because that is the right and just thing to do, and the wizard is evil and breaking the laws of the land.  The evil rogue goes to rescue the princess because he thinks he will get a reward for his action.  He doesn't care about the princess at all, he just wants the fat sack of gold or the increased access to marks he might gain by befriending the princess and her family.

It's against the interest of evil characters to go all psycotic murder hobo.  They will gain the unwanted attention of guards.  They will be put in prison or killed.  They will be blacklisted.  They will have bounties on their head.  It's in their interest to stay off this hit list and instead live and prosper.",1467331210

"newjersey","t5_2qhsu","So I looked into it.  [This watchdog article provides a more in-depth analysis](http://watchdog.org/199387/new-jersey-expensive-roads/) and also reiterates the 2m/centerline mile.  If you review the [linked report](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/) it makes no mention to NJ Transit, so why NJDOT reports NJ Transit supplements is beyond me.  Further, [DOT Commissioner Fox](http://www.nj.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/02/report_claiming_nj_roads_cost_2_million_per_mile_t.html) stated that NJ has 3.6x the number of line miles vs centerline.  So let's assume for a second that the national average is 2 lane miles per centerline.  The 200k/mile doesn't begin to pass a basic apples to apples comparison.  The RU report cannot possibly be based on the nationally reported data, and probably has convenient carve outs.  Other states seem to pay local road supplements, so Transit is the only X Factor that doesn't actually tie to the roads themselves.  I'd have to [presume that the report is only including the nominal $33 million state supplment and not the entire NJT budget](https://www.njtransit.com/pdf/FactsAtaGlance.pdf) because the 2012 [""Total Disbursements""](http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/hf2.cfm) was 7.2B and Transit has a 2B budget.  If you look closely at the chart, everything is 'roads' and not railroads.

I know I'm looking in some places at 2012 and some at 2014 and 2015, but let's concede that our overall expenditures can't be so far off between years that they make that much of a difference.

Edit: 212k per lane-mile puts us at 763k/mile if they have 3.6x lane miles vs centerline, with some fuzziness for on/off ramps so it could be as high as 1m/centerline line depending on the total 'non road' distances one counts, like the mile long ramp that takes you from I95 to the GWB, etc.  That's cost isn't out of hand, it is closer to in line with MA, NY and CT.  However, the other 1-1.25m/mile is probably a 'maintain' vs 'construct and maintain' definition. That kind of constraint on definition is typically how government career people make things sound less bad than they really are to their political leaders and the public.

Estimating a range of ~356 yards (you can estimate this from the way it is), and accounting for weight, BC, energy, wind resistance, the Coriolis effect, and curvature of the Earth you can quite obviously see that the total number of pellets fired becomes a function of the Schrödinger equation. Thus we see that both 1,439,318,655.824 pellets, and 33,072,986 pellets contacted him at the same time, and at no time, resulting in a calculated 6.023x10^23 pellets.",1467331213

Turn up ahead of time, and be the first one to offer a hand to get the boat ready.

&gt; 50 people with no gun and a shooter. if they are like you, they just die. if they are like me then only some of them die and there's 1 or more heroes

Your plan involves many of the 50 people dying in the process of taking down the shooter. Why would you risk so many lives when there would be much less risk in everyone having a gun?

&gt; if they are like you, they just die.

No they don't, because if they are like me then they would all have guns and there would be little to no casualties, unlike your plan that involves mass death because no one has a gun except the shooter. It's obvious that all people having guns turns out much better than only the shooter having a gun.

I'm by no means a Benning apologist, but I can at least see that he is doing what he can with the parameters and the assets that he is given. Some of his contracts are... not ideal, much like some trades that he has executed, but after what happened yesterday I think things are looking even better on Benning. 

If it takes one of the best young left wingers in the league (the best?) to get a young middle-pair dman then I actually think Benning is a rocket scientist for sending McCann (a kid who is best served in the AHL next year and only shows promise to be an under-sized second line centre) with a 2nd to Florida for Gudbranson. It's becoming obvious that defence is becoming a huge value in the NHL.

The way to ""cure"" a UA bomb lockdown is to sell Meta-Alloys at the station that was bombed. Ostensibly the station market uses the Meta-Alloys to counter act the damage caused by the Unknown Artefacts.

**I will repeat this again, when I link to Tisdale's peer reviewed sources, you will take this back?**

Baaaahahaha.. Ok I'm better now...

**Jesus on a bicycle, do you want an example of Cook doing this? Honestly I don't know why I ask, we all know the answer..psst ""it's cognitive dissonance""** 


&gt; I don't care where the science is hosted, if the person maintaining the site is a cartoonist or an accountant - what matters is that the source itself is scientifically legitimate. Tisdale isn't.

**You sure seem to care a whole lot what label the person has when you do not agree with them, but when they agree with your Cast-In-Stone unchanging dogma, then well let's move the goalposts shall we...**

But then I watched your d pick vid - which I glanced over but didn't click a few minutes ago. Gz on pick!

Anyway, I think that 10 minute video is what got you dislikes/no feedback.
If you had posted a picture, I bet you'd have gotten better results.
If it's going to be video you should probably make it a short(er) clip, or point out what time the important part of the video happens. *Edit: I didn't watch the rest of your video, since I assumed the d pick was the only worthwhile/mentionable thing because of your title. Maybe you should've named it (your reddit post) something else if your intention was to show more than you getting a d pick.

You baited me by saying ""comments appreciated"". What do you expect beyond ""gz on pick""? Did you expect me to watch the whole 10min vid?
Easier to click dislike after waiting nearly 2 minutes into your video to see you actually get the d pick (and react like it was a pet drop) and then be faced with another 8 mins left on your video. 
*Edit2: I didn't dislike your video or downvote your reddit post, but if I was going to those are the reasons I would.",1467331215

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","This comes down to evolution, more or less.  We tend to think of domestication as something we do to animals, but the traits that make an animals domesticate-able are randomly evolved.  They become extraordinarily advantageous (in the evolutionary sense) for a species because it ensures that said species continued existence is protected and ensured by humans (many species will tell you that its not so good to be on the bad side of humans...).

As for our ability to willfully domesticate animals, the answer is complicated. Time is the factor.  The entire topic of ""breeding"" is that of selecting out traits.  The famed russian fox experiment took 50 years to get wild foxes to the point of being friendly house pets.  Thats way longer than a typical domestication effort would support so most animals have become domesticated through random selection, rather than breeding.  We clearly _can_ domesticate animals willfully, but how often are we going to spend 50 years to do so?  (and it'd be a lot longer with animals that breed less frequently!)",1467331216

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Hi, I'd like to give my opinion cause I'm a pretty newish player only level 22 who plays support seriously. When I first got the game and my boyfriend was teaching me there was huge thing he had against support eg:

-boring
-don't get kills
-actually have to input into the team to help achieve victory
-etc

So basically I never new what support was and was told to go mid/top/bot (but stay away from jungle) and go nuts. I think there's a huge negative connotation attached to support so when someone cant get mid etc they go troll support cause they're mad they couldn't get the role they wanted. (but you probably knew all of this information anyways)

I'm not sure what can be done about it because I've had games where someone has called a role then all of a sudden goes a support role, and completely fucks the game intentionally. Why???? No one knows it's annoying. 

Maybe you could make a new account and start all new and level up in adc that way? Cause lower level people are way nicer I reckon and if you say do this or whatever they're usually pretty chill. I'm not sure if this helps at all.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","The wave you describe exists, but the OP article is not part of it. Sortition is obviously not better than elections in every way, but a system of electing representatives, as we have seen in the past several years/decades, absolutely has certain vectors by which it can be exploited in anti-democratic ways. Sortition does not have these same exploit vectors, and the exploit vectors it does have are not present in systems of elected representation. The author of this article is not advocating for the wholesale elimination of referendums or elections, he's promoting the supplementation of these democratic practices with sortition. Just look at what he uses as an example of sortition working at its best in the real world: the Irish constitutional convention. In that case, a group of representatives chosen by sortition worked with a group of representatives chosen by election to draft a referendum. Was that somehow undemocratic?  

&gt;This is fucking hilarious, a., because it presupposes that a smaller number of people will somehow come to a better consensus than a large number of people (why?)

Because getting a smaller number of people to agree on something is easier than getting a larger number of people to agree on something, or even just discuss something cohesively. 

&gt;And further, the argument rests on the same insulting presupposition that undergirds the whole ""people can't be trusted to govern themselves"" thing by saying that sortition works by giving this random, unelected group of citizens ""a chance to learn from experts, listen to proposals, talk to each other and engage with politicians"" in coming to their consensus. 

I wholeheartedly disagree that sortition presupposes any such thing. Giving ordinary citizens direct access to elected representatives, not just through phone calls and letters/emails that will only ever be glanced at by some overworked intern, seems to very rightly be placing much more trust in people than our current system. Giving those ordinary citizens a voice in actually creating policy instead of a simple boolean yes/no reaction to the policy or the representative's reaction to the policy is giving ordinary citizens a greater deal of trust than in our current system. 

&gt;Do you honestly think that the plebiscite doesn't do this just because they sometimes come to a consensus that you don't agree with, or that may be harmful? 

I think that people have busy lives and don't have time to make themselves well informed on every issue. I think that commercial media promotes sensationalism and soundbites because it's profitable, and that exacerbates the issue, especially when wealthy interests deliberately exploit this to mislead people. I think that also giving randomly selected people the obligation and opportunity to hash things out, in person and over a prolonged period, with other randomly selected people with different viewpoints about how given policy will actually affect them in their real lives will lead to better decisions than *only* having politicians paying lip service to win points with their base as they posture about legislation that will never affect them to other politicians who aren't listening but are only waiting for their turn to do the same. I think that elected representatives are subject to some very anti-democratic pressures that randomly chosen people would not be subject to. I think I'd be willing to trust randomly selected people in such an environment to represent me more than I trust establishment, career politicians.

&gt;Disregarding the idea that sortition is basically representative democracy without that pesky elected legislature, I don't see how you can call restricting aspects of the legislative process to small, unelected but somehow ""representative"" samples is anything but undemocratic.

Who's calling for replacing all elections with sortition?

&gt;Who selects the sortition samples?

Who selects who gets jury duty letters?

&gt;Of whom are they representative?

That'd depend on what they were selected for.

&gt;Why, in the name of God, would a group of 66 randos come to a better, more informed decision than 66 million?

Because those 66 ""randos"" as you so derogatorily refer to them (you seem to have a lot of respect for ""voters"" as a single entity, but almost none for any individual voter that would be included in sortition) would be given the time and resources to do so, as well as in person, regular access to the people  representing entirely different demographics/view points (both elected and chosen through sortition), which is not something that can be provided for 66 million on every issue. And that's not even starting on the issue of how you expect 66 million people to cohesively and democratically draft what's being voted on in the first place.

&gt;It's amputating your arm because you've got eczema.

Or, if, as the article actually suggests, you supplement existing democratic practices with sortition where it makes sense to do so, it's like taking medicine for your eczema instead of insisting that it would just go away on its own if only you keep doing the same thing you've been doing which is also somehow how you got eczema in the first place.

When you do everything through elections and referendums you're limiting constituents input to the political process to only two things: ""yes"" or ""no"". Sortition drastically expands upon the level of input that ordinary citizens have in the process.",1467331219

Republicans in Congress were so appalled by what FDR was doing, as well as the fact that Americans approved, that they engineered a Nazi plot to burn down the German parliament building and blame it on communists, thereby leading to anti-communist and right-wing maniac Adolf Hitler being given full dictatorial powers. They then encouraged Hitler to make aggressive moves in Europe, forcing FDR to halt his communist chess moves and focus on the impending world war. When it was obvious that the war was coming to an end in 1945, FDR was assassinated by the same Republicans, who made his death look like natural causes. Also Obama's a terrorist.

This is a case of more money not really equalling more performance. Most of what your cost is comprised of is either the cyberpowerpc markup, or stuff that won't equal more than a few percent real world performance and certainly don't make your PC last 10 years with no upgrades. Custom liquid cooling is also a massive pain in the ass, and only for people that over clock or do it for fun. No amount of money is going to get a PC that will run all future AAA games without compromising the fidelity or performance. Today's top of the line 10 year old hardware won't even meet the minimum for most new titles. My recommendation, spend 3k on a PC every 4 years.

"ClashRoyale","t5_3bog8","1. Although they are legendary, that doesn't necessarily mean that they need to have such amount of restrictions on obtaining them. A game where one of the main themes is collecting cards and leveling them up shouldn't be based on making them near unobtainable to the common player. Look at Hearthstone, which is a good comparison for a collecting card game, where the legendary cards are hard to get, but are realistically obtained through paying and dusting (selling) your cards you don't want or use, and getting the new one. SC puts unrealistic standards on how to get them, and essentially make them top tier play restricted and leveling. 

2. Can't really respond to this, no basis.

3. Despite it being a meta, it's awfully poor at best. The fact that on the official CR forums there is a tab specifically for card balances for the community to suggest, and that tab is always active, means that it's not just what's meta and what isn't, but that balancing isn't done right. When this game gets thousands of games of data a day, and cards are consistently winning, losing, or controlling games, there should be real balance changes, and a lot more regularly than waiting a month. Also, balances should not be focused on focusing certain card vs card, but rather, an individual cards performance.

4. Tournament mode is a solution, but the game shouldn't have skill in many scenarios be overridden by card level. Essentially, unless you are perfect at the game, with unbelievable amounts of knowledge and intuition, the game constantly stops you by having players with better cards faced up against you. 

5. Not a problem anymore, but an actual balanced gamemode where people play on equal grounds shouldn't take 3 months to come along. Maybe it is impatience here, but a true skill vs skill mode is overdue.

6. Agreed, but similar in similar context to my previous point.

7. A problem that has yet to be recognized, let alone brought up, discussed, or fixed by SC as well.

8. ^

9. True, and I won't argue against that. This was a bit more personal opinion after looking back at it, but it's poor nonetheless. Changes could be made, but the prices are unjustified the higher you go. Unless you are getting epics, it's usually better to just request every time.

10. If you look at the reddit post that linked the post on the forums, you can see that it is overwhelmingly hated, and unjustified. The option to mute would satisfy many players, while at the same time, emote users can still use theirs, but they just won't be seen.

11. 2 months for a card collecting game, with all of 54 cards to not have any additional cards is horrid. In a game setting like this, a lot of cards is healthy to keep the game fresh, a constant changing meta, and keep more cards in check with counters and combinations. Instead, with how few we have, there is an all to obvious power rating of cards, and a constant state of imbalance.

12. But is it good for a company to have it's players constantly hating it. Do you think the community will want to stay if they are ignored, and treated like cattle for money, rather than the players that give the game it's life, money, and additional players?

I would like to give a solid middle finger in your direction for this last comment. I make something based off of my view on the game in it's current state, and you make a comment that dumbs down to not worth reading, don't upvote. Why don't you offer another point of discussion rather than a half assed statement of disagreement.",1467331221

Sure you can say Dutch people are taller because of environmental and nutritional differences, but the difference is too significant to only include those factors. It wouldn't explain why Africans in impoverished countries are taller on average then Asian people. Why is height considered largely hereditary but intelligence can't be? Why is it racist to say black people score significantly worse on IQ tests then whites? Why are poor white kids on average less likely to go into prison then black people, why do poor white kids on average perform better then rich black kids on standardised tests? No one would accuse me of being a racist of saying Eastern Asians are smarter then whites on average, who are then outdone by Ashkenazi Jewish people, but when it's black people being scrutinised on statistics and evidence, then you're somehow a racist.

"networking","t5_2qkaf","A giant is also counted as an error, because according to the box, it is a packet bigger than the configured MTU. I would start with checking to see if the Giants are being dropped, or if they are a red herring. Would hate to have you checking out the giants as a real error, if the packers really are not being dropped because of it. I know some IOS versions would count a 1504 byte packet (with VLAN tagging) as a giant but still happily forward it. (Cosmetic bug only). Only way to really know why the slowness is occurring is to fire up wire shark on one end or both and see where the drops (if any) are occurring.",1467331223

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; Take this groovy line for example which iterates over a list of numbers and prints all the numbers below 6

&gt; [1, 5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 7].findAll { it &lt; 6 }.each { println it }​

What if you want to stop when you get to your first ""3""? There's no way to put in a break, so it's back to *foreach*. And why is another list being created, i.e. [1, 5, 3, 5], when all that's happening is it's being printed? And then why would you even use a list when only the array-like nature of the data is being used, i.e. traversal? Arrays are just as syntactically messy to represent in Groovy as in Java.

Better to use a language that's statically-compiled from the ground up (e.g. Java 8, Scala, Kotlin) with more dynamic stuff (e.g. list/map shortcut notation) added later, rather than a dynamic language with static-typing shunted (e.g. Groovy). The real problem with Groovy is it was initially designed by its creator (i.e. James Strachan) to be a dynamic *complement* to Java, but was repurposed by a later manager (i.e. Guillaume Laforge) to be a *competitor* to Java.

"learnjavascript","t5_2tugi","Foreach is a function that walks through the array and, for each item in the array, it calls your function and gives it the item, position (index), and the original array just because it's useful.

In this case, `callback` is your `Info` function. You hand off your function to foreach and it gets invoked with each item.

Teacher: ""Since you happened to arrive during the week where we're exploring human sexuality, I'm curious as to what input you have personally. Are you a virgin?""

Quickly devolved into him allowing the male students to raise their hands and ask me questions about my favorite position, etc. etc. I stated that I was a virgin, and was heckled the rest of the semester.

We’ve found ways to seek out the past for answers, to make cars run on the heart beat’s energy, and can even fucking travel through time (if you’re willing to lose a finger).

But those suffocate underneath the quest for a button nose and a tight jaw. Why — I’d love to say it bothered me, but I’m not an idiot. Why fight what the people want. And who can blame them? We’ve conqured beauty.

You can have tom’s fat ass in your lips and he can put your celulite on his abs. Beauty! Beauty is finally a buffet.

People laughed at the name at first. Beauty Buffet? For a Gym? But, we’ve soared into our first million dollar sale. People are waking up at the crack of dawn just to exchange their fat to have a crack like Dawn’s!

The idea is simple. Michelle wants a bigger ass and Bobby wants a flatter stomach. Switch it! Claire wants a smaller breast and Johnny wants a bigger cock? No problem!

The procedure is painless. The matching takes no more than a month.
Sure, now everyone kinda looks the same. Sure, I feel weird touching a woman’s breast knowing it might actually be an ass from a fat fuck. But everyone’s smiling! You can’t beat that. Business is good.

"MtF","t5_2ub9j","Ughhhhhhhh So it's been a rough like 20 hours. I'm meeting up with my parents this weekend for the holiday and I called last night to talk logistics and mentioned that I had taken some steps (aka HRT) that I wanted them to be prepared for. Well instead of helping it freaked them out thinking I was going to show up wearing a dress or with boobs (lol I wish HRT worked that fast) and so I had to call them back to explain, although I don't think that helped. My parents still think I'm going way too fast, although it's fine for me, and it doesn't help that I haven't talked to my dad in person yet. Anyway, psyched myself out the rest of the evening, only feeling better when wearing my bra and playing video games. 

Cue this morning. I decided it would be a good idea to send my dad an email essentially coming out to him officially since I hadn't yet (everything was through my mom). So I sent this long email talking about my history and what I feel and all and then crossed my fingers and waited for a response. I did get a response in the early afternoon and it was disappointing. He asked about RLE like its a necessary thing before hormones (its not per WPATH SoC) and asked about what I'm going to do with my hobbies such as ultimate, like ""is there a ""trans"" ultimate league?"" (lol yeah right, not nearly enough of us to even form a team even if we wanted to) Also he was going through and asking like, what about your friends, what about your job, what about your family, have you thought about all that? And its like, yes Dad, I have, I've only been spending 8 hours a day on this for the last month and a half. ANYWAY, it was disappointing, but for the most part it seemed like it was misinformation/not knowing more than bigotry so maybe in time he'll come around. And I sent an extra-long email back addressing every point and question and now I'm waiting nervously again for a response. 

So yeah, it's been a stressful almost 24 hours. Plus actually starting HRT and I'm feeling all sorts of out of whack. And I see them tomorrow afternoon, so we'll see how that goes.... Wish me luck ladies, and I'll maybe do updates here as the weekend progresses.... Man I wish this were easier...... Also sorry for the length lol it's been a long day",1467331235

Under capitalism what appears as expansion, opening, connection usually takes the form of the opposite for subjects [alienation]. 

The abundance of information certainly produces a dangerous self-righteousness [Dunning–Kruger etc.] now that everyone can play - and beat - Einstein...but the character and effect of any lost humility is also suspect, as if your turn to an Enlightenment myth of the liberating capacity of information as cure for a prevalent and 'natural' ignorance. Perhaps the whole world-view which has produced the very situation you want to criticise is contained within the phrase ""consume information critically""....critical thinking can only be illusory if it takes on the character of consumption..that information still bears this stamp of commodification is perhaps the exact problem [as is the over-emphasis on information, as if society had already abolished exchange-value and we lived in commons of open access]. The problem of how we can think critically - how we can think at all - in this society (let alone act critically) is a problem that runs so so deep.

They fail to see which direction the world is moving and, thusly, is the reason why everything is 40 years out of date. A huge example is our rail system. 

They think that by choosing to reverse all of the progress Democrats have made, and/or not changing anything at all when times-are-a-changin', we will magically pop into a fantastic economy and job market and everything will just be hunky dory. All the while ignoring how thier children can't afford a month of groceries on minimum wage, while they could afford college/family/homes on minimum wage.

The EU knows, for the most part, what's its doing. And it's populace, on average, is more educated on the stuff. Not to mention, the quality of life in Europe is typically a lot better then the average Americans.

Low - skilled, former Labour voters in the north and midlands. I'd imagine that UKIP are particularly asiduously knocking on the doors of this latter group.

I think that post-Brexit, the UK may move towards the introduction of further deregulation of labour laws; for this to happen in the context of increased austerity, economic downturn, and continued mass immigration might not be a good mix (regardless of the aggregate benefits of immigration).

* Pay for a home inspection, it's wonderful peace of mind, also pay to have your sewer line (if applicable) scopes.   Should cost &lt;$200 or so, and will tell you if shit is going to hit the fan (plus you can negotiate it before you buy)

* I prefer unfinished basements, because then you can do what YOU want with the place.. rather than adapt to what someone else wanted.

* Get the seller disclosures from your realtor before you bother going.   I found a house that was priced decent for the market, didn't look bad... got the disclosures after the fact... oh, look, MOLD!

* [I would carry around one of these guys to spot-check the electrical in a place](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001UKLG4I).  If it didn't pass even as simple of a test as that, I treated it as a warning sign.   Ground will depend on when the house was built, of course

* Before you jump into any particular project, make a list of ALL the shit you want to do, price it out, prioritize it... what can wait, what is best done before moving in?    Took me three months and over $10k just to get the ""pre-move"" shit out of the way..

"noveltranslations","t5_39owk","His family could:


Bribe someone at their local 3rd rate sect to ask the prince not to kill them. Since even the emperor has to bow down and agree to any somewhat reasonable demands from the sect, this would certainly happen.

Move to another country where the prince can't reach them.

Betray the 10nth prince and side with the crown prince in exchange for survival.

Try to assassinate the only person that actually wants them dead, the crown prince. It would be easier to do and won't piss off people that could and probably would slaughter his entire family and country in vengeance if something should happen to MC within the borders of that empire.

Become a subordinate to the Lin family for a few generations, at least until the current crown prince is replaced by one of his children.


Ask the crown prince if he actually does intend to kill them all, if they abandon the 10th prince now they could probably escape with a fine. We have had literally zero indications that the crown prince is in any way ruthless. In fact, there were plenty of indications that he is rather timid and forgiving.

There are probably other means I haven't thought of yet.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","I've been waiting to use this build, but I've not had any available campaigns to try it.  Feel free to check it out if you'd like.

Paladin 2/Sorcerer X.  I've not experimented with mixing even more multiclassing in because the 2/x combo gave me everything I was looking for.  It sets you up with two classes that share casting stats, access to all armor, weapons, shields, and only 1 level behind full caster progression.  With favored soul sorc you'll get extra attack by level 8, but this build can still work without it since sorcerer will give you access to melee cantrips like Green Flame Blade and Booming Blade.  Why do we like using these cantrips?  Because we can use our Divine Smite with them, we can quicken them with metamagic to get two of them a round, we can add our CHA damage to one of them if we go the draconic sorcerer origin, and on top of all that they scale as we level.

You'll be squishier than a traditional paladin, but more tanky than a traditional sorcerer, and the build works whether you decide to use STR or DEX weapons.  Whether you decide to use sword and board, or go for the Great Weapon Mastery, you have the benifit of choosing your preference unlike the more limited Bladesinger wizard archetype.  

Your primary damage can come from melee cantrips + smites, while still having enough spell slots to cast some utility/ranged damage if the need arises (take that flying enemies!).  By level 4 (2 pala/2 sorcerer) You'll be able to smite over 2x the amount a normal paladin could; with four 1st level spells, two 2nd level spells, and two sorcery points to convert into another 1st level spell.  That gives you seven smites instead of the usual three.  

If you want to primarily use Green Flame Blade, then you'll go the route of quickened spell since it can target 2 creatures.  Booming Blade can be used with twinned spell, however you'll need two creatures within 5 feet of you to make use of this, and you'll need to figure out what to do with your bonus action each turn after that.

I planned for my character to go Strength based, use a shield and heavy armor to keep the paladin vibe but trading some sustainability for longer lasting offensive power.  Dueling fighting style to add 2 damage per hit on all my melee cantrips/regular attacks, possibly getting shield master later in the game once I could haste myself to bash an enemy, hit them with a regular attack with my hasted action (to fulfill the requirements for the shield bash), and finish with a smite empowered melee cantrip with my main action.

I really like this build because even though it isn't very complex, it gives you just as many option in weapons and armor as a paladin has, while gaining a lot more in the way of magical resources.  You can stick with buff and escape spells to ignore your charisma, or you can increases it along with your physical stat to maintain great melee/ranged spell versatility.",1467331242

There are a lot of group interactions and you meet up in Adobe classroom four times a semester, which can be annoying when some classmates don't do their work. 

For people not familiar with ABA, they feel like the pace and load is very difficult, or so they said. However, as I was already a BCaBA, and you are in an ABA setting already, it can seem repetitive.

Meanwhile every indicator shows that Corbyn was losing heavily from the start.

I agree with you that a non-Corbyn strategy is far from assured, in fact I wouldn't bet on us to win the next GE if its this year even if we do change leader. But it might limit the damage or give us a fighting chance. You're right that ideally we should give them a chance to face a GE but even if its not as bad as people think it will be we will still lose and he will have to go anyway. If we do win it would be a totally unpredictable result and you wouldn't really be able to blame his opponents too much for not seeing something that no polls or evidence support.",1467331244

"brokehugs","t5_2wx52","&gt; Which is wrong because there were tons of ""average person"" heretics, not every heretic was an academic, most just followed the reasonings of those who popularized the heresy in the first place. 

Not the same at all. ""Heresy"" is something considered equal to orthodoxy in the more objective sense. Your random peasant farmer didn't have any solid means to verifiably declare it better in any meaningful way, nor did most of them think they did. They could go from one to the other and back again. Since one was the biggest inter-country power at the time and the other wasn't its not impressive that it stayed around. Its not at all comparable to a time when othodoxy no longer has the state power to punish other groups, but other groups **do** have solid enough grounds for moral reasoning to write off orthodoxy once and for all.

&gt;But I did not claim that the persons innovating the heresy were common unread uneducated folk. I just said that heretical movements in the past are comprised up of normal average folks, and oftentimes these movements outweigh what would today be considered orthodoxy in the culture of the time.

Which wasn't really the point.

&gt;I'm not disputing this, but fail to see how its relevant to the fact that there are plenty of times that what currently is considered orthodox was the minority, and was pushed around by emperors, tsars, kings and popes alike. 

Because that was never the point to begin with? Of course at random times and places orthodoxy was smaller than others. The point wasn't that it was always accepted by everyone. Its that in the past there was less solid tools for disagreement that was strong disagreement rather than merely opinion, and when one group has power spanning most of europe, and are the only group with such the situation is not at all analogous to what is happening in modern day. Modern day isn't just people leaving because they like another cosmology better, but because its become easy enough to understand even for normal people that the entire moral basis and so group in general doesn't have the legitimacy to claim the things it does in face of opposing moral evidence.

&gt;I never claimed that the modern sexual ethic is a fad. Im claiming that its a bit silly to think however pervasive that ethic is in western culture that it will universally grow into church doctrine (When I say church I mean Cathodox). 

Here's where the issue comes in. Why wouldn't it? No, I don't think they will become identical to typical indulgent liberal^TM ideology as expressed by people who don't like responsibility. But they will for instance eventually become pro gay for example. And the reason for this being that they are made up of people. For them to **not** change would mean that indefinitely every person of power would have to not do so. But the problem is that we're at a point even now where its rare for anyone educated to hold some of these opinions in any serious way. That's only going to increase, since some opinions are so bad that they only seem legitimized when entrenched into traditions. The guilt of holding to a harmful sexual ethic when the reasons they have for thinking they are wrong become larger than thinking they are right will certainly at some point in the future become too strong for them. This is different from having reason to think they are right but being persecuted. In this case, they will eventually realize they are wrong, like everyone else does.

There will be a point where there's simply not enough educated people holding orthodox opinions that that's who all the cardinals are. They will change, the new pope past then will be different, and so a point will come where they will find a way to change the church without losing the legitimacy they want for it. I don't know how it will happen. They may just insist that the infallibility aspect was a mistake, and it being a mistake by their new understanding is not a problem because they were not infallible. Or maybe they won't drop that, but will find a way to expand it in a way that is pro homosexuality. Sure, I know that **now** they think it would harm their legitimacy so much that they won't do this for a pretty decent amount of time time. But the world will look so different in even 20 much less 50 years that at some point its going to become obvious that its happening. The Vatican will change, and traditional catholicism will shrink in size, and likely merge with sedevacantism or something of that nature.

&gt;Only among us in the west. We are young, that may grow into the majority of other countries, or it may not. Every great empire and pervasive culture thinks itself unassailable at its height, then history changes and frustrates those kinds of plans. 

Are you comparing the west to rome? Because modern society is a little different than the past in that now its knowledge and things won't be lost if it falls and gets rebranded. This isn't just the west. It will happen in other places too, albeit a tad slower. Not to mention that the vatican is in the west, and draws from western people, so whether some poor closed off countries have a differing opinion is not really what will matter. This isn't about an empire, but about moral education in general. Something that the trend of will remain to some degree even if some type of societal collapse happens. Obviously if we want to guess what happens past a nuclear war that wipes out 99.9% of people, then all bets are off.

&gt;Perhaps here in the US, but that was to be expected since its the natural conclusion of the sexual revolution. expecting a universal decline of traditional sexual ethics based on what has happened in the US in the last 60 years is a little haughty. You may be right, but I doubt it. Cultures rise and fall, ethics change and change again and again, yet church teaching has stayed consistent enough when they are in power, and when they are not. In real persecution, and when they are the ones persecuting. 

What people call the sexual revolution doesn't only exist in the west. Aspects are spreading to other places. Especially now that the internet exists. Certainly it has bad aspects, but there's also aspects that once someone realizes aren't an issue its hard to go back. There's not really any grounds for someone who previously thought otherwise to go back and say that homosexuality must be wrong just because. Its something that to think usually involves having to have grown into it indirectly. There will always be exceptions, but this trend isn't a random ebb and flow. Its similar to the trend of things like realizing that slavery is something that should always be done away with.",1467331249

"eldertrees","t5_2tclf","OK, full disclosure: I work with one of the CBD pet chew companies you mentioned, Treatibles (www.treatibles.com). 

We created our superfood chews with hemp-derived CBD (legal worldwide) in hopes of helping animals with a variety of ailments including joint pain, inflammation, separation anxiety, and seizure disorders. With over 2,000 customers testimonials, we can confidently say that epilepsy is one of the main reasons why our customers use Treatibles, and with great success. CBD is the active ingredient in Epidiolex, which is a seizure medication in development for children.  We are not veterinarians and cannot advise on whether Treatibles would be a replacement or concomitant regimen, but many Treatibles customers do use the product exclusively. 

I've included a couple testimonials below. I hope you find their stories helpful! If you have any questions, please feel free to give us a call at (415) 579-2230. 

""This is Macy - our beloved rescue Chihuahua/terrier mutt. She is 4 years old and started having seizures 4
months ago. We took her to our vet and she told us there was not much we could do other than to give her valium
suppositories when we see a seizure start. That seemed awful to us because she became so terrified at the start
of every seizure - we didn’t want to have to wait to see a seizure! We wanted them to stop! We were lucky enough
to run across an article online about CBD treating children with epilepsy and decided to investigate. We soon found
stories of Treatibles and decided to give Treatibles a try. Within a few days Macy seemed so much better. So much more alert and happy. And the best part: NO MORE SEIZURES! For over a month now she has been completely seizure free
and we are so grateful! Thank-you so much for saving our beloved friend and family member, Macy!""

“Just after Bernie’s first birthday, he had his first grand mal seizure and was soon diagnosed with epilepsy. After
visits with several vets and specialists, we hesitantly put him on the recommended potassium bromide. Changes
in his behavior and a lack of improvement in his condition quickly led us to seek out other options. In researching
CBD for pets, we came across Treatibles and a few other Companies. After trying out a few options, and
even having products lab tested, we quickly came to the conclusion that Treatibles had the best product on
the market. The customer service team helped us in figuring out his required dosage and answered all of our
questions. Their professionalism, care and knowledge assured us we came to the right place. A year later,
Bernie’s condition has greatly improved. He’s back to his normal self and his seizures are now few and far between,
and noticeably less severe. Seeing the improvement in his quality of life makes us and our sweet Bernie extremely thankful for the team at Treatibles!”

"solotravel","t5_2rxxm","Hey! It was a really long time ago (like I said, Spring 2013) but I believe there were locking cabinets under the beds or some kinds of lockers. I was paranoid so I always chose hostels with lockers. Hostelworld usually has that information so I'd suggest checking there or maybe message the hostel on facebook if they have one! I felt safe there though and everyone was really nice. I can't remember what the front door situation is exactly...I think there's someone working the desk and then from what I remember you have to kind of walk into separate buildings from the lobby for some of the rooms, and I believe you get a key and a wrist bracelet so people know you're a guest. It was a long time ago though so that could have changed.

The only thing that sketched me out the entire time I was traveling alone was actually the park nearby that someone mentioned on your post...I was dumb and went there alone to read or something and I didn't realize that it's a park where people sell drugs or something. There were a bunch of aggressive African guys there that kind of heckled me so I left. So maybe just avoid that spot! The hostel itself was great and everyone was really friendly. :) And Berlin is crazy and wonderful.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","If you think Justicar isn't good in Shaman, then you clearly haven't tried it. Which is fine, most people haven't.

Justicar gives you two advatages in shaman, it allows you choose your totem, and more importantly (in my opinion) it allows you to roll the same Totem multiple times. Being able to get 2-3 healing Totems when you want to control the board with beefy minions, or getting 2-3 spell damage Totems when you have all of your spells is simply incredible.

In my opinion Justicar is only weak in shaman, because control shaman isn't super strong. Also, shaman has one of the strongest 6 drops in the game in Fire Elemental. I've definitely put Justicar in my control shaman decks, and she performs super well though. 

Really, my biggest problem with Shaman decks that use Justicar, is that it's often difficult to get to turn 6. The problem isn't Justicar though.",1467331250

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","“It’d be easier to just bury him here.” Teka states, leaning on the fencepost. Benyam hums in agreement as they watch the stretcher be carried towards the van nearby. 

“Easier yes, but he would be in foreign soil.” Benyam leans on his staff. Teka considers the answer for a while. “It is good that we found him long before the ants did. It’s a shame that the elephant trampled him and died as well from the gunshots.” 

“There’s no difference between the soil. Dead and buried here or dead and buried there.” Teka shake his head, standing up straight. “If the soil here is good enough for us and our ancestors, it is good enough for him and his.” 

“Would you like to be buried away from home, Teka?” Benyam fixes him with a strong gaze. There’s a very long silence. “I didn’t believe so.” Benyam returns his gaze to the men loading the body of the hunter into the van. “He will not arrive home alive, but he will return nonetheless to rest with his ancestors.” 

A very long silence follows as they watch the doors on the van close, the men having climbed inside with the body, one of them hopping into the driver’s seat. The rumble the van makes as it starts up carries far in the arid savannah. It takes off down the dirt road, back towards civilization. Benyam sees it off with a small prayer for the dead man inside. 

“That is important.” Teka finally acknowledges. “He will arrive home dead, but he will arrive home.”

But there is a huge difference between the short-term memory performed under the unconsciousness in your everyday routine and the long-term memory, which can last for just a few days, or for a lifetime depends on the intensity.

Considering the time span of HOI4, I highly doubt that the experience of commanding bloody, intense battles and constantly making life-and-death decisions under the enormous pressure would get rusty over the next few years. Especially if you were to continue fighting in a war.

The memory would not be exactly the same. It will go through revising and incorporating process with other war experiences, hence making it easier to recall and even creating a mutual synergistic effect, which will allow you to have more insights and in-depth knowledge.

There are so many historical cases where the retired or dismissed generals took charge again and showed not-at-all rusty skills.",1467331253
"LabourUK","t5_30c1v","How about you convince the membership with credible arguments? Instead of trying to keep the most popular candidate off the ballot by holding the party to ransom and trying to force a resignation? How about you just give an open election and try and win people over?

How about you convince all these people so apparently desperate to vote for a centrist Labour party to pay 3 quid/become a member and vote from home? It's hardly asking a lot, I see no reason it would be so hard to convince people when someone as allegedly unelectable and incompetent as Corbyn is having such an easy time. The membership hasn't been this high since 1997.

How about we give Corbyn a chance with a cabinet and PLP that fully support him? If not his exact policies then the broad church ideals of Labour. It cuts both ways, you can't count on the core vote of moderate leftwingers if Labour is only a broad church when the 'right people' according to a minority of the membership are in power. People like Andy Burnham have the right idea. He disagrees with Corbyn on stuff but toes the line and acts with a sense of party loyalty. No slander, no mudslinging, no baseless accusations, no blaming someone for not being a good leader while actively trying to weaken them. 

&gt;You can moan about the PLP all you like but guess what, every time you support this false dichtomy between what you support and ""the PLP"", you completely ignore the substantial minority of the party who don't agree with you. I'm not a member of the PLP and I think we are heading towards disaster, I'm not alone either. 

Well that is great and I hope you stay in the Labour party. But I strongly disagree with you if you think that it should a majority of members supports only matters when it's in favour of 'your' person, and should be ignored by the PLP when it isn't.

To me the decent thing, for everyone involved and the party, is to have open and fair elections. Once the results come in everyone must make a personal choice if they aren't very happy  with the result. Should they stay and work with what the party has decided with civil disagrement, should they stay and try to undermine things in a way that damages the party and leader or should they leave. Personally for me it would only ever be the first or last choice if I was unhappy. Even if I hated a leader I respect the party too much to try to undemocratically undermine things (not that I really could as a lowly member). It would take a centre-right leader for me to leave I think.",1467331253

"DetroitRedWings","t5_2resw","I'll buy your argument...to a point. You can't compare the role of a Jurco to that of a Miller or a Glendenning. Their job is to shut down the opposition. Jurco is NOT better defensively or on the PK than Miller, Glendenning, Andersson, or Helm. He may or may not be better offensively. We've not yet seen it at the NHL level.

Bottom line is that we need a 4th line that can grind on the other team's top line and ice an effective PK. That said, I agree that Jurco hasn't been given a fair shake in the top-9 where he belongs. That's why I hope he gets moved. For his sake. I think there's a quality middle-6 winger in there. But I don't think he's going to be given that chance in Detroit.

Pulkkinen started last season on Pavel Datsyuk's wing. What better linemates do you want?

And finally, the value of hitting (on the forecheck in particular) is that it wears down the opposition, it forces them to make mistakes, forces turnovers, and generates offense. This is exactly why other big hitting/forechecking teams like Boston and NYI have had such success against the Red Wings these past few years. They force guys like Ericsson, Smith, Quincey, and hell, even Kronwall to make mistakes and turnover the puck yielding quality goal scoring opportunities. ",1467331256

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","This is not a horrible system at all, and I'm a bit hesitant, but I'm for it. I've seen it work well first-hand.

The only danger is that people figure out which report reason causes bans and then start reporting people who play badly (not on purpose) and stuff like that. And if it's automatic, what happens next is obvious.

A system like this would be great for at least giving out warnings, possibly short bans. Then have the longer bans be human reviewed. I could see that working.

Ofc in real life all this shit is massively complicated and even the best ideas can fail.",1467331256

This actually happens for you because of the weighted tables, and is the main reason for them, getting people to do other stuff is secondary.  It just so happens that you don't like the stuff from clear skies, but what if you did?  You would love it.  The problem is more closely tied to how lame Falcon Lost is and how much better the set pieces from 1.1 are.

Simply put, everyone is complaining because they want Striker/Sentry/Tact, but hate Falcon Lost.  It is not a problem with weighted loot tables.  They are a good thing.  The real solution here is to make other sets better and/or more enticing.  Believe me, people would end up being a helluva lot more pissed if all pieces had an equal chance to drop across all activities once they realize that they can't ever find the pieces they want.",1467331257

"australia","t5_2qh8e","The Plebiscite is just a bad policy decision though, we didn't have one on the abolition of slavery or the women's and aboriginals vote, it just got legislated because it got to the point where the obvious discrimination and social evil became too obvious. we will see a very ugly side of society emerge in the lead-up to the plebiscite. it would have been nice not to give them an excuse to get onto a soapbox.

With climate change to say oh the minister for the environment is begging the skeptics to commit. at this late a stage we should be already be committed and planning for the future. and also you think effective policy decisions around our living habitat would kinda be a no brainier. its no good waiting for the more extreme denialist to come around i think that's a pretty poor defense of the liberal party. by saying they have a policy on climate change it doesn't work but hey it exists so that's something. 

With healthcare, I think its much less about relieving the cost to the state and more about under funding a service so it becomes dysfunctional then use its dysfunction as an excuse to privatize.
you will probably say that's just political propaganda, but then again your 'relieving the cost to the state' statement could also be argued as the party line excuse. and since its a strong belief of the neo-cons that private sector does everything better, its a plausible hidden agenda.",1467331257

I refuse to use Hog Rider, as it is an unskilled and NECESSARY part of getting past arena 5-6 without figuring out real strategies for MOST people.  (I'm trying really hard to get past without hog and it's proving very difficult). Then they hit Arena 7 against legendaries and that's where the salt against legendaries comes from. These guys end up down at the bottom back at arena 5 or 6 and utterly destroy everyone with the same technique over and over because that's how they got to arena 7 and no further, get knocked back down with high level cards and towers and then ruin the bottom arenas for everyone else.

The simple fix would be to take more into account with matches besides just trophy count. For the record I am doing this to satisfy my curiosity really. I want to see how long it takes me to get passed without hog, then see if what I am saying is true by adding hog later and see if there is truly any difference.

As a part of my acne skincare routine, I also use a very effective combination of LJH Tea Tree essence, GoW's 10% Lactic Acid and CosRx brand BHA which is incredibly gentle.

As for both the money aspect the other examples you gave from motorsport, you forgot one key factor: every single one of them would still be considered hireable by others in motorsport because the shady things they did weren't so much for their benefit as the TEAM'S benefit. Did they stand to personally profit from sticking their neck out? Almost absolutely. But case in point: even the FIA overturned Briatore's F1 ban because while what he did was cheating and despicable, he did it in an attempt to help his TEAM gain an advantage, not to line his own pockets at his own team's expense. 

Companies and teams in highly competitive environments don't ostracize cheaters... They *embrace* cheaters...hence the saying ""if you ain't cheating, you ain't trying"". However, they HATE selfish cheaters. If you purposely sabotage your own team for solely your own selfish gain and get caught... You can bet your bribe earnings you'll never work in the industry again. 

I'm sure you'll still stubbornly refuse to see it, but there is the difference my friend. Never suggested that we live in some fantasy world where people with money are ubcorruptable... If anything, they're MORE easily corrupted. The difference is, as recent events have shown us, you can be corrupt as FUCK, the public can KNOW it, and you can still be CEO of a Wall Street bank or run for POTUS. But when you've proven to be corrupt out of pure self-interest, you're very unlikely to have the friends you need to keep you employed. ",1467331260

Take Booming Blade, or Green-Flame Blade, since the attack roll is a normal weapon attack, you can use Shillelagh on your quarterstaff, and now your attack will scale up as you level. Alternately, be a variant Human, and take Magic Initiate Wizard to get the attack cantrip(or both) and Find Familiar as your spell.

Having done some work in this area, I realize it's not so complicated to produce a model that yields ballpark results.

I want them to simply choose a desired situation, not ""dial in"" or execute the maneuvers necessary to achieve it.  That would be my job.

If I must go down that road, my confusion will begin with transferring between bodies.  Is there a ""friendly"" formula for predicting an idealized two-burn inter-body transfer?  And another for finding ideal transfer windows?  And another for speeding / slowing for rendezvous?  As I imagine approaching these tasks, I start shying away from the whole project.

"hapas","t5_33rcf","&gt;What about your experience though...are the condoms actually tighter in Japan?

I haven't used a condom in a few years (married/mastered the pull-out game). I used to import Trojans with spermicide BUT when I had used Japanese condoms they were *different*. This was pushing over 10 years ago but people really didn't use them at the time so the brands were kind of cheap (ones bought in a drug store). Since then I'm guessing the quality of the condoms have improved and the range of varieties as well. I have used shitty condoms in the states as well, tighter, shitty lubrication, way easier to rip, etc. 

On a side note, when I went years ago to a Japanese sex shop they had a bunch of cool shit. Surprisingly enough in the sex shops I saw a lot of ""normal-looking"" couples buying sex toys and stuff and then go to a love hotel. It was pretty cool and the condoms I bought there were WAAAAY better quality than what I had bought at the drug store at the time. 

So basically if you go to some cheap-ass love hotel the condoms will probably be low quality. If you buy them at a sex shop or a high-end hotel they probably will be of better quality. 

Also, in Japan the spas (onsen) are fully nude. I go often so I see a lot of dicks. There are all sizes here and yes, I have seen very small ones but I have seen ones that (albeit flaccid) were legit. ",1467331261

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","I can't emphasize enough that you are not screwed. You have many options and will be fine in the long run. 

I very rarely post on Reddit but I'm making an exception in this case because I failed out of first year engineering at UofT, and dropped out of university entirely. 

But then I changed my mind, went on to get a degree in psychology at York University, then went to graduate school at Stanford, got several good jobs, got lucky and was successful enough in the tech space to retire at age 35. 

So ... Here's my advice. 
The most important thing is to understand that the problem isn't you. It's the mismatch between you and engineering. You don't like engineering. That's 
 fine. There are a million other things you can do with your life. Your lucky you're not going to spend your life doing something you don't like with people you don't feel are ""your tribe"". Bullet dodged!

You are in a good position for many reasons:
1) if you really want to pursue CS there are many online courses, community colleges and second-tier universities that will basically take anyone and they all offer entry level CS courses. If CS is for you, you will do well and learn a lot on your own too and you'll be able to move on to a full fledged CS program, or entry level jobs in that field.  You're very lucky that your chosen field cares far more about what you know and what you can do than your credentials. In a few years if you have some good projects in your portfolio you can start a CS career regardless of your academic credentials. 

2) Your very lucky you're in Canada where the community colleges and universities are much much cheaper than in the US and you can definitely wend your way through the system, take out modest loans that would be easy to repay once you're working etc.    if Americans can do it at 10x the cost you certainly can!

3) you're very lucky that if you do study CS and for whatever reason it doesn't ""work out"" your skills, even if they're just making a website or knowing how to process data, or customize apps for your particular situation/process are extremely useful and marketable in almost all fields today. Whether you end up a developer or a librarian, teacher, business person, whatever -- the skills you'll have picked up in CS will be applicable, useful and make you more marketable. 

So my advice is ignore your parents angst. Go ahead and pursue CS any way you want -- on your own, at a community college, at a second-tier university. See where It leads you. Keep your eyes open and your mind open for opportunities and fields and people  that you find out about as you go through life. Something will excite you and you'll pursue it with enthusiasm and be fine.

My boss' father fought in WW2, and when he got back he partnered with another guy, and they got a small loan, and spent their wages from the war, and bought a bunch of ranch land.  They cleared 30,000 acres of land to raise cattle.  Two generations later, I would love to do something like that, but it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more, far beyond the reach of anyone but large corporations or the richest 0.1%.  I am thus denied the freedom to be productive in that way, because other people claim they own all the land, and police with guns will enforce their claims to ownership if I try to ignore them.  The closest I can get to raising cattle like that is to work as one of their employees, and that offers no hope of ever owning my own ranch, or passing it on to my children, as they were able to do for their children.

What you say in your last para is actually a more nuanced understanding of Orientalism than what the Wikipedia article might have implied.

He might have been playing the Christianity vs Islam/Judaism game. It seems like that, and that is disappointing.

I would say things really started ramping up around 27ish.  It is way easier for me to bang/date girls in their early 20s now than it was when I was in my early 20s.  Of course you're going to find the occasional girl who is 20 and prefers guys her own age, but in my experience most of them prefer someone a bit older.  Girls aren't like guys.  Most girls 18-30 are not looking at a guy and saying ""He's so young looking, thats hot"".  They find a guy who looks a bit older way more attractive.  Now I'm not talking out of shape and decrepit.  I'm talking in shape, maybe some slight lines around the eyes, maybe a little grey hair coming in on the sides, that type of thing.  It seems the older I get the easier it is and the hotter young girls think I am.  Also once you get into your late 20s/early 30s you tend to be making more money than most guys in their early 20s.  You're able to take a girl out, you'll have a nicer car than most guys her age, you're able to go places and do things that college aged guys just can't do, you're able to dress nicer, and all of that is very impressive to a girl who is 23 and used to dating guys her own age.

&gt;I'm stuck at this stage. I used to love to write and read, but the depression took that away. Now I'm much better than before, but the desire to read and write is pretty much gone. I'm sort of in a limbo as to what I want to ultimately do.

I think I miscommunicated there. The implied thing you want is money and time. Why you want those is that they give you options. Options give you the freedom to continue to figure out what you enjoy.

I used to be really intellectualistic, but looking back, I think it was mostly because I grew up poor and didn't have much else to do with my time. And I'm not just saying that; I have concrete achievements to demonstrate that I really was prodigious. To name one, I was the youngest person to ever take abstract algebra in their first semester at my school, and I got the best grade in the class, beating a grad student. I think a lot less about why now, and just do.

I didn't know what I enjoy. I still don't, really, but I do get some enjoyment just out the the freedom to do almost anything I want and every once in a while I find something I *actually* enjoy in and of itself.

Also, start exercising. That also helped me get more grounded and out of a continual existential funk.

I only play online the meta doesn't seem to run many high energy attackers that I don't feel like can be dealt with by either giratina or darkrai so I find yvetal-ex a bit unnecessary.  
I took out the latios because the decks that run few basics (greninja, trev) are already decks I beat most of the time.  
It means I can get rid of the muscle bands and put in more ffb.  
Baby Yvaltal and Hydragon are good for the regice and jolteon-ex match ups, especially with FFB.  
Hydragon also means that if I don't have a tooled garbordor I can retreat tina into darkrai without a float stone and with only losing 1-2 energy instead of 3-4.  
I also run xeroxic which can be good at delaying decks dependent on special energy, or getting the ko on night marchers with FFB before/after I hit them with baby yvaltal.  
Also I have won a few matches by being able to xeroxic my garbrodor, retreat tina for less energy and hit them with darkrai for a ko where it wouldn't have if I had to discard more energy or tina would have been ko'ed because I wouldn't have been able to retreat otherwise.",1467331268

$1900 is the lowest point, not average, and those are going to be unrenovated apartments.

You can indeed get good deals in Washington Heights and Inwood, but that's barely regarded as being in Manhattan, and a different market. When people talk about cheaper rents in NYC, they're not using Inwood.

Condos actually don't follow demand. In NYC, they initially built the condos in really strange areas off undesirable subway lines. Eventually the neighborhoods catch up. Look at Bed Stuy. The condos predate the demand and desperate renters go to less convenient or ""transitioning"" neighborhoods. The option becomes renting a $2900 place with a pink bathtub, and a worn down Home Depot kitchenette, or paying $3200 for a brand new to market rental, with a dishwasher, and laundry in the unit. Living in Bed Stuy off the G line becomes attractive. Then the restaurants and shops to cater to this new clientele pop up, often pretty quickly, and it's a nice mix of old residents and new, in refreshed blocks (and I can name the exact blocks). Then the old residents get priced out, the rents go up and there's more demand, and suddenly it's not a 3rd choice, but a first choice, where someone moves and wants to live in Bed Stuy, and Clinton Hill. Biggie's ""one room shack"" sold for $750k three years ago, and that was before gentrification took hold of the area.

Rents in SOMA, Hayes, and Mission are already high. You're having a hard time believing we'll see effects, when that story already played out...we're already seeing them. The demand, is there as you say, but you can stimulate more demand by building more, trying to offer more units, and make hot neighborhoods hotter. We've see that in the Mission. You think it's going to taper off, but it got hotter. In NYC, that's Williamsburg or Dumbo, where they keep building, and the market keeps going up as a result. 

The growth will not continue as it has the last 4 years. This forum s a good indication of that. You have to really want to be here, and SF doesn't have a good track record of keeping transplants to begin with. These people don't really love SF, and they're not going to remodel the city to fit Paris or whatever vision board they have. ",1467331269

"news","t5_2qh3l","I will say that since the reviewers were never shown the final report, the study is a culmination of multiple other studies that were pulled regardless of who funded them, we may be getting some real junk data in there. Also  

&gt;""The exact number and distribution of guns and gun types in the United States are unknown, but for each of these populations it would be valuable to have counts of total guns owned, their attributes (i.e., general type, caliber, firing mechanism), how the guns were acquired (i.e., purchased, received as a gift, traded for, stolen, etc.), and information on the sources of the guns (i.e., licensed gun dealers, friends or relatives, gun traffickers, owners of stolen guns, and so on). It also would be valuable to better understand both the violent and relevant nonviolent and self-protective behaviors of individuals with firearms.""

So.. in essence we have no idea how many guns are out there, what kinds are out there, and where they are located... but that data would be helpful. 

&gt;High-quality data that are usable, credible, and accessible are fundamental to both the advancement of research and the development of sound policies. Anonymous data are sufficient for these purposes, and in fact anonymized data should be used to protect civil liberties. Basic information about gun possession, distribution, ownership, acquisition, and storage is lacking. No single database captures the number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States. Because different forms of firearm violence respond to different strategies, without good data it is virtually impossible to answer fundamental questions about occurrence and risk factors or to effectively evaluate programs intended to reduce violence and harm. Data about the sources of guns used in crimes are important, given that studies suggest that the mechanism by which an individual acquires a gun may predict future violent use of that gun. The National Violent Death Reporting System is a beginning, but it covers only one-third of U.S. states (CDC, 2013a).Additionally, the lack of comprehensive datasets and the wide variety of sources and the fact that the data lead to contradictory conclusions call into question the reliability and validity of gun-violence data. Technological opportunities and recent advances that can enhance linkages among datasets from other federal, state, and local sources may enable better predictive analytics, real-time information sharing, and reduction of data noise.


So the thing that most liberals complain is that this report just says ""Hey, we scoured the internet and every other source we could find, we put them all in this big o'l report without worrying about who was paid to write what. Lots of this data contradicts itself, but without independent study, we'll never know which one is really true. BUUUUUUT... here's what we came up with in lieu of that..""

It works fine as a ""This is what we think we know"" but it should not be taken as the end all be all of ""We know guns"". Even in their own report they say that. 
&gt;The research agenda proposed in this report is intended as an initial—not a conclusive or all-encompassing—set of questions critical to developing the most effective policies to reduce the occurrence and impact of firearm-related violence in the United States. No single agency or research strategy can provide all the answers. This report focuses on the public health aspects of firearm violence; the committee expects that this research agenda will be integrated with research conducted from criminal justice and other perspectives to provide a much fuller knowledge base to underpin our nation’s approach to dealing with this very important set of societal issues.

Liberals was a more detailed reports with independent study. They want to look into a lot of these claims, and look for causality. This report cannot and will not do that. This report cannot even say that the numbers from it's sources are accurate or not massaged to prove a point for pay.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","I do also enjoy video games and my long time bf has been working in the video game industry for almost as long as I've known him (which is 10 years). Video games were actually one of the biggest things we had in common originally. We eventually moved into board games because of tabletop gaming section of Pax East (been to every one) and because many people who work on video games do end up drawn to board games.

As for how much video gaming I get in now? Well that's decreased a bit. I've pretty much given up on console gaming (the bf is still holding on) and only play games available on PC. Even then there are way few games I am interested in now than I was just 5 or 6 years ago. I do play a lot of a specific MMO called Guild Wars 2. Run a guild in it even, so that consumes most of the time I do sit down to play video games.  

But overall, I keep up on franchises I like, maybe try something the bf tried and thought was amazing, but I now play through less than 5 video games in a year now (granted, some of those are stuff like Witcher 3). I think the biggest issue for me is that the types of co-op games I once enjoyed are now very rarely ever couch co-ops. Biggest being shooters, I miss my split screen shooters. So now I am just mostly left to my 1 player games and single MMO.

On the flip side, my playing of board games has increased dramatically. It's an excuse to get together with friends, to get away from computer screens, and have something resembling a social life. They have filled the hole in my life that was forming from my growing disenchantment with the video game industry and brought me closer to my irl friends.

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","I've managed to start doing this successfully! Here's what works for us:

Rule 1 is patience. This is not something to rush AT ALL. Also, watch her for signs of discomfort/cringing/pain/anxiety. Even if you guys use safewords, even if you guys have consented to her being uncomfortable or hurt, slow down and check in if you see evidence that her pleasure drops. If you don't want to be verbally checking in that much, or think it would kill the mood, back off and focus on pleasuring her for a bit before diving back in. 

My partner goes digit by digit, and doesn't add another finger until he makes me cum. So 1 finger, orgasm. 2 fingers, orgasm. Etc etc. It will relax her, and the vagina loosens when things feel good. Plus, on top of the lube, she'll get increasingly wet, which is helpful. 

If things aren't working, reposition. If you feel like your knuckles can't get past her pelvic bone, switch the position she's in. She should be laying down/otherwise fully supported so none of her muscles are tensed. Don't think you need to open her legs wider, either, that could make the pelvis close more. Lift her legs, or have her raise her knees to her chest or sides. 

Once you're in, don't jackhammer with your arm. That can be extremely intense and painful. Make small motions, ask her how they feel. Some people like to get fucked with a fist, some people can't handle more than wiggly fingers. I really enjoy when my partner angles his wrist so his fist is against my gspot, and moves back and forth very gently. It's like tiny tiny fucking, more like pulsing.

"SSBM","t5_2so9j","The cornering thing. Not counting any invincible moments. [This set](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8W54WsDbBKo) And keep in mind getting the hit at max range is usually not intended it is just the best outcome. Bold is something that is pretty much one to one with what I am saying.

1) right off the bat, if M2K made the right guess in neutral HBox would have been cornered.

2) 45 seconds in M2K is cornered and HBox's grab covered the dash back range

2.5) getting back on still cornered

3) 1:22 another side swap by HBox. Watch how often he tries this, like the next time he recovers.

3.5) 2:02 side swap for position, didn't work out. May have been for crossup to avoid grab punish, but the fsmash punish was pretty free so I will count as intentional for stage.

**4)** 2:20 M2K got HBox to roll into the corner, but didn't follow because he didn't call it out.

**5)** 2:57 HBox afraid of needles, but m2k runs off.

**6)** 3:18 hbox afraid of nair and my flair. M2K even sees this and attempts to cover a jump out

7) 3:37 M2K just scares him I guess and gets some pressure and damage out of it

7.5) 4:10 side swap after failed edge guard

8) 4:35 hbox is cornered for a little bit trying to dodge bair

9) 5:12 M2K cornered to dodge nair, but hbox lands a bit too close due to late reaction and has to escape

**10)** 5:20 M2K corners HBox with nairs

M2K played extremely solid in most of the pokestadium match and kept center almost the whole match (he slipped during the transformations). He could have tried to corner, but I think he wanted to just rack up damage with lasers instead. It is more acceptable because pokestadium is large and he was actually able to win the neutral when it counted. Only major gripe is that HBox backed off at some points that he probably didn't need to.

**11)** 7:27 HBox corners M2K with 2 bairs

12) 9:42 M2K makes HBox take the ledge over landing

13) 11:55 counting this because HBox didn't actually cover tech in place or tech in. M2K feared bair and cornered himself. If HBox missed the techchase he would have cornered him

14) 11:58 M2K fears something and rolls into ledge

15) 12:58 M2K wanted to avoid the hit and corner himself, but couldn't. Close enough for me.

Big thing was in the last game HBox started to call out M2K and his lasers, so a lot of things that usually would be something that forced M2K back just became a faster move to actually gain the hit. The hit did corner M2K, but I am not counting hits unless it was clearly a failed retreat. If i did count every time M2K or HBox got hit because he didn't take the safe retreat and instead tried to poke outside their range it would be closer to 40 examples",1467331276

My point is, it could really leave a sour taste in your mouth starting Lancer and being bored for the first half of leveling. I'd recommend starting as something else and getting a feel for the game in general, then coming back to it later if you're interested. The nice thing about the game is you can freely switch between every class at any time (outside of duties) and each class has its own level and bonus attributes and stuff",1467331278

"vita","t5_2sjmv","They are kind of like a separate thing to the point that when you start the game up with the dlc installed the first thing you get is an option to start Muramasa Rebirth OR Genroku Legends.
Each DLC adds a new playable character who plays entirely differently to the main two characters (who were basically identical to one another), each with a new story line that on first play probably takes around 2 hours, each one has 3 new unique bosses.
Each one then also has a second ending that requires you to beat every boss from the original base game with the new character. So if you are going for completion, there is ALOT to do with each one.

Personally I think the DLC is absolutely worth purchasing.
Additionally, I've NEVER seen DLC for anything on the vita go on sale, only ever the base game.

Edit: for a quick idea of playtimes, I spent 40 hours on the DLC (spread across all 4) to clear them normally with both endings. A further 2 hours for the two that have speed run trophies (both are beat the game in under an hour) and then another 14 hours to beat each one (default ending only) on Fury mode.
So theres plenty of time to be spent here if you wanna do everything.

For a comparison, in the main game I have 26hours for clearing the game normally with all endings on both characters, another 26 hours to clear the game with all endings on Fury mode, and then another 90minutes for the speed run :v
I should mention the DLC's play time is double for the initial file because you do have to go through all the main games bosses/stages 4 times instead of the base games twice. 8v


Why the complete collection isn't on sale, I've no idea.
Since the main game without DLC is on sale, and it makes it cheaper to buy the base game and then the dlc pack separate, my suggestion would be buy the base game first, load it up, see what you think, and then if you like it pick up the DLC pack, since the price on that isnt going to change.",1467331279

I understand how wollay and pixxie feel because I was on a nine-person animation team for five years for a movie that was supposed to be done in 7 months. Want to know why it took so long? Hardware issues, consistency issues, the original plot was bad, the voice acting was bad, the editor had a baby halfway through, the producers changed, people went off and did other things, we presented it at a convention and people hated it, so back to square zero. Sometimes, this happens to creative projects, and conflict becomes internalized, delays result, and there is nothing you can do about it but keep moving forward at a slow pace until you get the final product right and FINISH. Yes the producers and investors were upset and dissapointed, but we eventually delivered.

Game mods like Skywind and Enderal have this issue, taking upwards in the rang of 5 years to finish as well. Fez, Duke Nukem Forever, Owlboy(7+ years), and many other games hit the progression plateau in development.

All we can do is wait and deal with it. I personally believe as a programmer myself that Wollay and Pixxie are still churning away at Cubeworld. I have 100% faith in that. I also have faith in that they are in a pretty deep rut and are working themselves out of it back to getting a fully-featured and playable version. Layman gamers, on the other hand, are pretty pissed off and distrustful on the flipside because they feel betrayed, lied to, and decieved in their expectations.

So what am I saying? Chill the hell out. You're in two different worlds. Wollay's focus is to make a good game, and your focus is to play the game you bought. Upon him lies this humongous mountain of responsibility, and upon you lies this hunger for a procedural action rpg. Upset that you're hungry?

I assume you can buy berserker's late game if you want but it probably won't make a huge difference when you already have Void with makes flat mpen better and have Nashors which makes even more attack speed not as good.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok. This might get long. 

So as a kid around 11-12 I had the world on my fucking plate. We had these woods around us that I never ever came close to finding the edge of. I would wake up in the morning early when school was out and my friend Alex and I would spend the hole day out muckin round those woods. We would pack sandwiches and sodas and just go nuts. Play army and war, Cowboys n Indians, you name it. This being the 80s and Alex and I being smart enough kids, my parents had no problem with this and enjoyed taking us to the army surplus store to buy stuff like MREs and survival knives and camping gear. It was pretty regular that we would be allowed to stay out overnight if my dad was there to help us set up camp close to the property. 

So not on an overnight, but out n about one day we find a treehouse in a part of the woods we have never been to before. Probably bout a 2 hour trek from the edge of the neighborhood. Maybe 2 miles or 3, it was hilly and rocky. Seriously, a kids dream. This treehouse is probably 30 feet off the ground but it looks solid. We are so stoked to find out new castle. We hightail it back home to get some rope and my pops takes us down to the surplus store and over dinner Alex and I can't shut up about it. 

Next day comes and we hike out at almost dawn. We got a backpack full of rope and sandwiches and our knives on our hips and excitement that's so thick we could chew on it. We make it out there and start attaching rungs made from big sticks onto one end of the rope. It took us a good few hours but we get one side finished and the rope tossed over the branch that's where the little deck and door are. We finally climb up and are sitting on the deck looking out and rock, paper, scissors for who gets to go in first. Alex wins and goes in and comes right out. He's white as a sheet and wants to go home.  So curious as I am I go inside. This treehouse is probably 8x8 and about 7-8 high inside. The inside walls are covered, every single inch, of naked girls. Not awesome found playboy porn, but kiddy porn. I think the oldest kids were about my age, but it was Polaroids and glossy magazine pages, stuck perfectly up with staples and filling the walls up. 

Exit Alex and I getting back home as quick as we could. We informed my pops about it and he calls the cops. The officer shows up and asks us a few questions like where it is, how did we get up there, where did we buy the rope, did we take any pictures off the wall. He got increasingly rude about it and my pops put an end to it. He left with our statement and said he would be in touch. We were no longer allowed to take overnights in the woods or be out there for more than an hour without checking in. We actually built a really long tin can phone with the permission of my parents which allowed us a bit more of our freedom but we were pretty cut off from the deep exploring. 

Bout a year or two later that same cop stopped me when I was hanging out in a different park. Saw me smoking and caught me with a joint. Alex asked him what ever happened with the treehouse. The cop told us to not do drugs and left us alone. 

In college many many moons later, Alex sent me an email saying how he read in the big state paper (towns that are say, the county seat have their own papers, but the capital city has the big paper) that that officer shot himself with his service revolver after his wife found out he was circulating CP. 

So it comes to my mind like it came to Alex's that we had found his little CP stash/ cave. The creepy part came a few months later when Alex sent me another email saying that he went to the estate auction and one of the items for sale was a rope ladder with a bag. 

Creepiest story of found in the woods I have folks. Still grosses me out and sends chills. ",1467331284

&gt; While Iran has been criticized heavily by the international community regarding its high number of executions per capita as well as its notoriously harsh crackdowns on political dissidents, journalists, musicians and others, human rights and behavioral changes, including the monetary and material global support of terrorists and suicide bombers as well as the release of American hostages were not negotiated or mentioned in the recent Iran nuclear deal struck between the country and the P5+1 nations.

&gt; While Iran has been criticized heavily by the international community regarding its high number of executions per capita as well as its notoriously harsh crackdowns on political dissidents, journalists, musicians and others, human rights and behavioral changes, including the monetary and material global support of terrorists and suicide bombers as well as the release of American hostages were not negotiated or mentioned in the recent Iran nuclear deal struck between the country and the P5+1 nations.

"Workspaces","t5_2t1la","I'll second /u/otherjared's suggestion of monitor arms.  I'd highly recommend [Herman Miller Flo monitor arms](http://www.hermanmiller.com/products/accessories/technology-support/flo-monitor-supports.html).  They're the best arm I'm aware of on the market and, astonishingly, they were among the cheapest articulating arms that actually supported a decent amount of weight: $250/arm for the Flo (7-20 pounds) and $300 for the Flo+, which supports larger monitors (20-40 lbs).

I have 2 Flo + arms supporting a 27"" iMac and a 30"" monitor, and 3 regular Flo arms supporting 2 24"" monitors and a laptop stand.  [Here's what 4 of the 5 look like on my Uplift Desk](http://i.imgur.com/70FJoda.jpg).  The 5th is on the desk to the left, out of frame.  They rotate 360 degrees horizontally at the base, 180 degrees horizontally at the monitor or laptop stand, and 90 degrees vertically (i.e. to raise and lower) at the monitor.  Between those and the desk raising and lowering, there isn't a position you can't work with.

As another suggestion, I'd recommend getting some power and cable management.  /u/chrismbarr's suggestion of the cable management tray is a good one.  In addition, you can buy an [8-outlet strip](https://www.amazon.com/Opentron-OT3093-Metal-Protector-Outlet/dp/B00O8N0Z2S) that you can screw into the underside of the desk, and plug most of your gear into that, then have just a single cable coming down.  (Mine is actually plugged into a power conditioner, and then the power conditioner's cable is the one that comes down.)  If you need more than one cable going down from your desk (I also have 4 audio cables going from an audio interface to a subwoofer and then returning to my studio monitors), [Uplift offers a cable management as part of a kit](http://www.thehumansolution.com/uplift-advanced-wire-management-kit.html), but it's $60 and there are [tons of options on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=cable+sleeve&amp;rh=i%3Aaps%2Ck%3Acable+sleeve).

Economists currently consider themselves rigorous in their mathematical modeling and it has engendered monsters like David X. Li’s Gaussian copula and the Black-Scholes eq. Praxeology is logically defined, not mathematically. This doesn't make it invalid.

I won't quibble the semantics of “doing nothing is an action” or that the definition of social science is the science of human action. But I can offer the justification you seek. We can justify enacting the economic freedom that Praxeology proposes by comparing the indices of economic freedom by country to their economic success and relative happiness.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","IMHO yes.  Several other manufacturers have similar levels of capabilities and there are no people filming themselves doing stupid things.  To quote myself from the link earlier:

&gt; You need to understand your customers and the hype surrounding your products by changing your marketing and public statements until expectations are met on all sides.


&gt; What matters is how the customer perceives the software and capabilities.  This is exceptionally important in the case of safety-critical software, especially when you are in the dangerous region of say 80-99% reliability.  Customers will trust the system because they never see problems, and things like this happen.  Thankfully it was a light accident, but it could've been much worse.  [This is a good overview of autonomous vehicle testing and validation](http://www.slideshare.net/PhilipKoopman1/challenges-in-autonomous-vehicle-testing-and-validation).

&gt;Nevertheless, let's look at some of Tesla's marketing.  They call it Autopilot, for one, which is a bad name for something that's semi-autonomous, and largely influences initial thoughts on a system.  Many other car manufacturer is calling similar systems something along the lines of advanced cruise control.  And the fact that it failed in a relatively easy case shows they definitely need to change customer expectations or have better testing.  The warning in the manual specifically talks about stationary objects above 50 MPH, where this appears to be a slower speed.

&gt;Their [Opt-In](http://i.imgur.com/BNYW0H2.jpg) warns nothing about its limitations, though I'm sure it's included in the email.  There's various [articles](http://electrek.co/2015/06/16/understanding-teslas-self-driving-features-the-autopilot/) that mention ""autonomous"" features.  Sure, they say it's not ""fully autonomous"" a bit later, but there is a lot of area between Autopilot and fully autonomous, and the line hasn't been drawn.  

&gt;Given how much hype there is around Self-Driving-Cars, one should be very careful of how it is portrayed or you'll get consumers doing the above.

&gt;I'm a bit glad that we're starting out with small accidents to further deter people from being idiots, but that's not someting Tesla should've relied on to educate owners.",1467331291

*****
&gt; Iran is currently observing &amp;quot;American Human Rights Week,&amp;quot; in an effort to shame and mock the United States&amp;#039; human rights violations throughout history.

&gt; Many of the billboards have a repeated logo of a U.S flag dripping blood which says &amp;quot;American Human Rights&amp;quot; and a Persian hashtag that translates as &amp;quot;Inhuman rights.""

&gt; While Iran has been criticized heavily by the international community regarding its high number of executions per capita as well as its notoriously harsh crackdowns on political dissidents, journalists, musicians and others, human rights and behavioral changes, including the monetary and material global support of terrorists and suicide bombers as well as the release of American hostages were not negotiated or mentioned in the recent Iran nuclear deal struck between the country and the P5+1 nations.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Make sure you have food &amp; water for times when you get stuck at a shipper/receiver that doesn't allow you out of the truck or no amenities nearby. Best purchase I made was for a ""Sta-Rat"" (company is out of Spokane WA and you can find them online) a trailer tandem release bar assistant that worked every single time (warning - re-setting the thing is really hard, make sure you have the strength to do that).  Keep a couple pieces of sidewalk chalk handy for when you need to adjust your tandems. Mark the hole where the pins are originally (I usually put a square shape around the hole), count off where you want the pin to go (I marked with an X at the top of the hole) and you'll never have to guess on where you started and where you ended up.  Also...note that different brands of trailers have a different amounts of space between holes, so watch out for that in doing calculations. Trailers with about 2"" inch space = roughly 275 pounds of weight per hole. Trailers with about 4"" inch space - roughly 325 pounds of weight per hole.  If in doubt, spend the money and scale an empty trailer with the pin in any hole, move it one hole, and scale it again. Make a note of that and when you get a trailer again with that same amount of space between the holes...you'll know what to do.  I got so good at it that I never had to re-weigh and never overweight.  As far as protection/safety...keep mace at your fingertips, ALWAYS lock your doors, NEVER allow anyone in your truck with you.  I mean NEVER! Keep your cell phone charged and do not hesitate to call 911.  And male truck drivers will either fall all over themselves to help you or they are chauvinists and will do anything to humiliate you or talk down to you. And 90% only want one thing...so be prepared to ignore and walk away and be able to say ""If you don't leave me alone, I'm calling your company and/or 911 (if they happen to be owner/operators).

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","Tldr: you can hear more clearly the same way with higher pixel density you can see more clearly. 

Listen to your speakers from the back,  then to the sides and the slowly move toward the sweet spot right in between them. As the sound changes quality along your way imagine the sweet spot in dead center in front was infinitely far away and you could keep walking toward it and the sound would just keep improving.  

If you were to eventually reach that point infinitely far away it would sound exactly like you were in the studio as the song was being recorded. Every instrument including vox would sound completely real. They would be exactly proportionate in size and separation. The voice would sound like it's in the center with noticeable space at its sides and would be as tall as the singer is, the drums would be the size of real drums and not only would you hear the sticks tapping and drums thumping but also the acoustics of the room the drums are in. When you turn it up nothing changes size, you only move closer and everything stays to scale,  when you turn it down nothing shrinks it just moves farther back away from you. It's realism, consistency and imaging. The term people usually use to describe when all those come together is ""holographic"". In stereo mode the two speakers themselves stop producing audio and just reach a state of zen and then the sound just begins emitting from the three dimensional space in front of you and to your sides. Some speakers in stereo mode will even be able to reach behind you magically. The sounds are so coherent and well separated you could point at each sound as it's emitting from the air and reach out toward it as if it was something you could touch. 

You could get pretty close to what I'm describing for around 1500 bucks for a pair of speakers and 500 bucks for headphones in my experience. 

P. S. Lower end equipment is usually bass and treble emphasized. Generally, and here in the states especially, people choose lower end speakers based on how much the bass rumbles and how searing the treble is at the cost of actually fidelity I. E. Precision. So you might actually be a little bit disappointed by high end speakers or headphones at first listen because you might have been conditioned to listen for the wrong things. Bass and treble are like MSG and sugar in food. They could make literal crap seem good but the more you taste it the less interesting it becomes. With both food and sound it should be the opposite.

"9M9H9E9","t5_3edeh","Her conversation in that thread seems somewhat suspicious. Maybe I'm just overthinking it. TheNumbOne has never posted in that subreddit before despite seeming offended when he said ""Many of us take this quite seriously"". His first post is even a story from over a year ago featuring a young girl, a monstrous woman, a strange recurring dream sequence, and a character who smells like ""death"". 

It's a reach, and his other comments seem to debunk any theories I could come up with, but there's more than a couple strange coincidences at the very least. The account hasn't posted for more than a month, and he comes out of the shadows to write a response to Karen in a subreddit he's never used before.

Also, in his responses to Karen, he makes several grammar mistakes, whereas his post in r/Paranormal is fairly well written. I didn't go over it with a fine tooth comb-which means I'm probably wrong-, but the mistakes were very noticeable in the posts from today. Nothing stood out to me while I was reading his first post. I find it hard to believe he forgot how to use commas. Could this be meant to throw us off?

Finally, it may just be me, but his style of using a conjunction to begin a sentence is something I consider fairly unique. I'm a college student and therefore, read a lot of papers. It may be a regional/cultural nuance, but it's definitely a rarity for me. In the official narrative, there are 59 instances of "". And"". Could this mean something? I don't know. It's probably just some weird coincidences from a random guy with nightmares, and an interest in the multiverse.  Could it be that he's the author or an accomplice pushing the narrative further? Could it be Q informing Karen of the futility of her efforts? Or maybe even I could be the author on another random, rarely used account fucking with you all with even more meta bullshit? I guess we'll never know..

Fuck. It's too much to take in. How can Karen handle hyperspace?",1467331295

Practicing during the day when napping seems to work well (better than at bedtime when you are physically and mentally tired and the brain is more liable to lapse into unconsciousness due to its need for deep, restorative sleep). However interesting you mention about the meals before hand...I've heard a number of projectors state that one should avoid eating several hours before attempting a projection, as one's energy is diverted to digestion and it weighs one down. So it might be good to compare experiences directly after eating and avoiding eating before hand and see if there are any differences.

Sometimes, they are violent towards other children who they view as a threat to them getting that attention. In their mind, the attention giver can only attend to one person at a time and they HAVE to be that person. Thats some serious emotional conditioning thats all kinds of messed up. I would suspect thats why Josie hit your son. 

I would suggest talking to Josie first. Let her know that you were upset because your son got hurt and because of what Josie did. Let her know that you know she did it on purpose and that hurting other people on purpose is not okay. But also tell her that if anyone hurt her on purpose, you would be upset too and want her to tell you. Let her know you love her and even if you love other people (like your son), there will always be more room for you to love her too. Tell her you will always be there for her and if you arent, its not because you dont want to be. CPS may take a while to get this all figured out and knowing that youre there for her while it does will help. 

Then call CPS. Provide any proof or personal statements you can of your sister and her husbands behavior. If you can, see if any trusted family members will also give their personal statements. Sadly, expect that your family (parents, grandparents, etc) will probably support your sister and will alienate you from the family for doing this. Your nieces life is totally worth that loss.

For me and so many other people, it's been very, very deeply life-changing, at least the genuine breakthroughs where we encounter this separate intelligence is. I've been lucky to have lots of those experiences, just since I've had a lot of access to DMT and have been able to work with it and take it really seriously for years. 

What I notice is that most people who don't reach the levels that I'm talking about are combining it with other drugs that are going a different direction from DMT, most commonly coffee or alcohol. But all the people who do report having the alien intelligences encounters, including a majority of Rick Strassman's subject participants, are not lying, I swear to you. It's a ""real"" phenomenon, as opposed to hallucinatory, which is why people so often report getting meaning and intelligence, not just a random visual experience. Also, I've be working for years on getting into hyperspace without DMT, and I find it pretty easy, especially in the absence of things like coffee, Adderall, and alcohol. 

Anyway, we have experiences such as this, described by Terence McKenna.

Hardly ideal and co-operative EU citizens, and that's not even the average person, that's members of a very pro-independence at any cost discussion board.

There really isn't any ""pretence"" about deferring Eurozone membership. It is not compulsory:

* All EU member states without an opt-out must [join the Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union).
* To join the Eurozone you must meet [the five convergence criteria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria#Criteria).
* Condition #4 is two years membership of the [Exchange Rate Mechanism II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Exchange_Rate_Mechanism).
* Membership of the Exchange Rate Mechanism II [is voluntary](http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/euro/adoption/index_en.htm).

The last link is to the European Commission's own website. It's not a trick, it's how it works.

&gt; Euro and Schengen are the main ones for most people across this island.

Easy enough then. No opt-out is needed to defer Euro membership, and either all three countries in the British Isles will have a Schengen opt-out or the UK won't be in the EU at all (at which point Schengen is moot).

IMO the reason this wasn't expanded on in 2014 is that Salmond wanted to keep the debate constrained to topics that people had heard of. ""The UK has opt-outs, we'll get them too"" is an easy message.

The two years of debate prior to 2014, and the Brexit situation, makes it much easier now to explain exactly what will happen.",1467331299

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","I agree with everyone who's suggested doing what you can to be supportive.  However, I do want to follow up with something equally important: Remember that you're a full half of this relationship.  Yes, they're going through an important stage of life, but so are you.  This means that you can be supportive, but you shouldn't feel guilty about being uncomfortable with or struggling to adapt to what's going on.  And don't let anyone make you feel guilty just because ""it's what's on the inside that counts.""

I'm saying this as someone who does identify as genderqueer/borderline trans.  (Disclaimer: I'll often tell someone I'm a lesbian when asked because I am biologically female and am attracted to women, and I don't often feel like spending an hour or two trying to explain gender identity and sexuality.  But I do make a point of full disclosure with potential partners.)

The thing is, I would absolutely HATE to see my partner suffer because they feel obligated to embrace any changes I might go through.  I remember speaking with one ex about potentially transitioning.  She said some very supportive things, but I could still tell she wasn't comfortable with it.  Eventually, she admitted that she didn't think she could be with me if I ever did take steps towards physical modification.  It hurt, but I understood.  I would still be me, but my body would be different and she would find it unattractive.  But you know what hurt the most?  The fact that she felt the need to hide her disappointment and concern simply because she was trying to be supportive.  I appreciated her honesty more than her attempts to stick with me.

I know that's not the same situation you're in now, but it's relevant because you need to be honest with yourself.  I'm not telling you to give up.  I'm simply saying that you shouldn't feel forced to be someone you're not.  If you still find yourself attracted to your partner (mentally and physically), and want to stay in a relationship, then go for it.  But if your partner's gender identity continues shifting to the point that they no longer resemble the person you initially fell for, then don't let anyone make you feel obligated to stick around.",1467331301

Yeah, the only thing really ""holding him back"" was that he wasn't from the line of Aerys and Rhaella. Of course, we all know R+L=J so he actually is from this line meaning, bastard or not, he's more than likely AA or TPTWP.

As far a last name, I guess it doesn't really matter. AFAIK, it has to do with where you're born, so Jon is technically a Sand (hiss with me). Although I guess you could make a case for it being where you grew up so that people know you're a bastard. For instance, the last name Snow in the North probably holds more meaning than the last name Sand. Of course, I'm not too sure that there are hard and fast rules on the last name anyway, it could just be more like guidelines.

One semi interesting - semi tinfoil thing to note is the opposition of Snow (Ice) and Sand (loosely Fire). Seems like everything about Jon is just a big contradiction. ",1467331302

"TumblrInAction","t5_2vizz","I was vegetarian for 15 years with many vegetarian and vegan friends. I know what vegetarians and vegans eat and it largely isn't healthy. It's a lot of pizza, pasta, potato based fare and fake meat etc and they're overwhelmingly B12 deficient even though it only takes a supplement, no one seems to do it. 
However I think simply paying any kind of attention to your diet leads to slightly better health outcomes so vegetarians and vegans waddle into slightly better health than the average by accident by not being able to eat every available bit of junk food put in front of them and having to plan their meals and where they eat.

I went the salad and daal route with you because you made such a song and dance about quitting sugar which pegged you as one of *those* annoying people as well who've read Sweet Poison or whatever and think that's bad as well. The kind that has no concept of moderation so don't understand why normal people can eat sugar and meat without being obese or having red meat every day and how that can be a crap load healthier than the hydrolyzed vegetable protein every second vegan eats in their vegeburgers, notdogs, vege-bacon and everything else you can see vegans posting and talking about every day on /vegan. I completely agree that most vegetarians and vegans don't eat salad. That would be too healthy, or it would be a roast pumpkin and macadamia nut ""salad"" smothered in dressing and at least 1000cal. I would go as far as to say I've never seen a male vegetarian or vegan eat a salad. That was just for you. I have however seen a ton of daal eaten.

""quit sugar"" lol. How about exercising some self control and moderation in the first place instead of turning it into a pack a day habit you have to quit.

You're also obviously lying about not telling the guy to go vegan. It kind of reminds me of a child that puts their hands over their eyes and thinks they're invisible. We.. er.. CAN SEE what you're doing:
 
Knock knock 
You: ""Hi I'm from the Jehovah's Witnesses, have you heard about Jesus?"" 
Him: ""yeah look, if I joined your church I would be less happy in my life so goodb-"" 
You: ""I used to be like you, then I mustered up the will of God to stop sinning and I'm so much happier now""
Him : ""Yeah look, I just told you I don't care in plain words""

We do know there are other ways to proselytize that aren't just ""You should go vegan"" everyone else gets this. No means no, not ""tell me your personal journey of how you think you became a better happier person"".

If you only interjected on his statement about being happier and living longer I wouldn't care. It was the sanctimonious and passive aggressive bullshit that went with it, calling him undisciplined, comparing him to fat people when there is no logical comparison because eating meat != excessive eating etc that was the issue.

"DebateAnarchism","t5_2vkaw","Buenaventura Durruti wanted to form a defense committee and Makhno had his own revolutionary army. Since anarchism doesn't preclude federating at regional and national scales why would forming a defense unit under collective control be prohibited? Especially if it is a question of necessity? And how would that impinge on the autonomy of the different regions of a federated union? Bookchin noted that the task of a council at the regional or national level was to compile stats and route correspondences from different regions. That doesn't necessarily entail exerting executive authority from the top-down. 

Here are some of Orwell's observations:

&gt;""During the first two months of the war it was the Anarchists more than anyone else who had saved the situation, and much later than this the Anarchist militia, in spite of their indiscipline, were notoriously the best fighters among the purely Spanish forces."" 

&gt;""In practice the democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline is more reliable than might be expected. In a workers's army discipline is theoretically voluntary. It is based on class-loyalty, whereas the discipline of a bourgeois conscript army is based ultimately on fear...In the militias the bullying and abuse that go on in an ordinary army would never have been tolerated for a moment."" 

&gt;""As usual, the breaking-up of the militias was done in the name of military efficiency; and no one denied that a thorough military reorganization was needed. It would, however, have been quite possible to reorganize the militias and make them more efficient while keeping them under direct control of the trade-unions; the main purpose of the change was to make sure that the Anarchists did not possess an army of their own.""

"news","t5_2qh3l","This is funny, but that's actually an important point.  In this country, unlike some more restrictive countries (e.g., see: free speech in much of Europe) you absolutely have the right to be an idiot, an asshole, completely in the wrong, or any combination of the above.  It's an important freedom too, IMO.  Hard to weed out assholery (e.g., the KKK) if it never rears it's ugly head.  Hard to educate the idiotic and ignorant if they never say or do stupid shit.  And it's hard to find the right answer to a problem if you aren't open to the possibility of being wrong first (see: scientific method).  And when government becomes involved in this, it becomes very easy to abuse innocent (and not-so-innocent) people simply because they hold the wrong opinions.  When the theoretical foundation of your government is dedicated to protecting the rights of its citizenry, the right to be wrong (or an idiot, as the case may be) is actually critically important to freedom.  One just hopes the idiots don't win the debate du jour... although if they do, at least we have ways to correct the problem previous forms of (largely totalitarian) government (like monarchies) did not.",1467331305

The club owns the planes, and the members own the club. This is the way flying clubs *should* be organized, IMO. The clubs out there that aren't set up this way aren't really clubs, they're just rental FBOs with a buy-in. Like Costco.

The other half presumes the opposite, that the focus should be on the poor, since they're currently unproductive and need to be invested in to make them profitable to our society. 

The former are referred to as on the right, the latter as on the left. However, the executive, voting members of these groups (senators, congress, etc,) all actually vote to the right. 

Most Americans do not follow politics at all, and those that do tend to get their information from big media... people don't actually look at voting records. So even now, a huge percentage of leftists are about to vote for Hillary Clinton, just to prevent a trump presidency.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Outside my room there are two large water tanks with pipe drains leading into each one. A friendly possum family used to sleep on the transformer near the water tanks, I guess because it was always cooler closer to the tanks. Anyway, one summer, over a period of about three weeks, I noticed this smell getting progressively worse, wafting through my window from time to time. It wasn't a problem until a few weeks had passed and this smell became unbearable. The kind of smell that actually made you feel like throwing up. So, I told my dad about the issue and he pokes around outside my room to locate the source of this smell. He came to the conclusion it had to be coming from inside the water tank and promptly investigated. Turns out that two possums had been slowly liquidating in the water tanks. So, it turned out that for nearly a month, I had been smelling the entire decomposition process of two dead possums. We figured they must have hidden in the drains on a windy night and then got stuck and fell into the tanks. What a way to go. This was four years ago and I swear I can still smell that smell sometimes.

Just kidding.

In fact, you are subjecting your SO to slavery because he is at the whims of your sexual experience and has no alternative.

In truth, people are beginning to understand that there are asexual people. You sound like you might be one of them. But it's also widely recognized that asexual people are not compatible with NL people because they can't understand how NL people think and thus there is ultimately resentment and pain.

There's nothing wrong with being asexual. There is everything wrong with saying to your SO ""this is how I am, accept it on my conditions, no compromises, I don't care to understand your perspective, I make all the decisions here.""

* Tier structure: You have 5 levels of Print and Play rewards with varying pieces being sent out. There should probably be one print and play tier and one game tier. People don't want to pay $35 for the game to be mailed tiles, dice, and pawns, they want a complete game with a box.  
  
* Rules. Your rulebook or at least a video clearly showing how the game is played should be available on the page. The example at the bottom was hard to follow and not clear.  
  
* From what I gather of your game, it is a roll and move mechanic (outdated mechanic) mixed with a little bit of deduction, putting it about on the level of Clue. I'm looking for a little more out of a game and some more innovation before I invest in a first time company.

Scott was heading to work at Freddy's as usual when he noticed his wife wasn't home. He assumed that she was still at the restaurant finishing up the night shift. ""Maybe she fell asleep in the office,"" he thought to himself.

When he came into the office, all he found was a pool of blood. He searched the other rooms frantically, not able to find anyone. The last room he checked was the backstage area, which he was surprised to see had blood everywhere, especially on the spare Freddy suit. On the wall, some of the blood had been used to write a message:

""Dear Scott,

Something went wrong with animatronics. Foxy sliced arm with hook, others stuffed me inside spare Freddy. I'm dying. Take care of kids for me. Fix robots. Characters must live on in hearts of children! Metal still slicing my organs. He's looking at me. He's saying your name. He's angry. My eyes fell out. Now my teeth. He's looking for you. Run.""

Scott looked over to the left, knowing that something was there watching him. It was that Puppet thing. He could tell that it was... thinking. He made a bolt for the exit and it started following him. He closed the door just in time to shut it in. As he was walking away, he heard his wife's voice for the last time.

Though at least even if you never did them before you can get the re-play reward. So my current main has a record of 1 Kurland. And without a lobi reward attached to the re-plays he'll never see a Kurland again.

to clarify I had boldly they rode open for over a year I just didn't want to do it. Doing it today for the very first time on that character granted me the re-play goody without even dropping the mission. So 1 Kurland for him in the end count.",1467331317

"ModernMagic","t5_2xs5t","I personally don't consider Force of Will to even be ""broken"" in legacy. The card itself is very fair. It has enough of a drawback to just make it a fair card in general. 2-for1ing yourself and the point of life make it so that it is a card you use to counter spells that need to be answered, mainly key combo components. Even in legacy it's a card that gets boarded out against a bunch of stuff, because it's sometimes not worth the card disadvantage. So from what I know about the current modern meta (I'm rather new to modern so I could be wrong) there really isn't much need for it. It definitely has the potential to push a control deck over the edge to be broken, but FoW in and of itself isn't that broken. I would say that counterspell would probably be more broken in modern right now. Thats just my opinion though.",1467331317

"Terraria","t5_2sg5b","Okay bro.

So. I shall start with the Blocks (or Tiles) around you that builds up a world. 

&gt;-----------------------------

[Tiles](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Block):

There is a countless number of obtainable and unobtainable. Some can be mined, some can be crafted and some will disappear when you break them. You can build everything with them. It is up to your imagination what you can build though. [House](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/House), castle, decorative building, (completely new terrain if you don't like the current. I did that once. 10/10 would do it again) Some tiles are biome specific some can be found everywhere. However you can't mine them ate once the tools you have got are often not strong enough to mine specific ones. There are foreground and background blocks. Foreground can be mined with pickaxe or axe. Background tiles will be mined with hammer which you don't have right at the start you must craft one. And here I switch for the crafting stations. 

&gt;-----------------------------

[Crafting stations](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Crafting_station):

One must realize that with such a tremendous amount of things in the game they must have some sort of place where you can craft things. This is exactly what the Crafting Stations are for. I will give you a head start. Make a [work bench](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Work_Bench) from 10 pieces of wood. Now if you place it somewhere and stand close to it you should notice that of you click on the little hammer-y thing right to the [scrollable list of items](https://hydra-media.cursecdn.com/terraria.gamepedia.com/2/2e/CondensedInventory.png), that you have much more items to craft. That's the case with the other crafting station. You craft, or get them underground. (This extensive use of the word ""craft"" is somewhat annoying, isn't it?)

Now we have universal crafting stations where you can make a wide variety of things (beds, fences, walls, other crafting station, weapons) and then there are the ones that can be used for crafting theme specific items such like the [Glass Kiln](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Glass_Kiln), [Bone Welder](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Bone_Welder), or the [Steampunk Boiler](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Steampunk_Boiler).

&gt;-----------------------------

[Biomes](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Biome):

Now you realize you are in a forest, with forest background, and a pleasant ambient music.

But if you travel a few hundred blocks there should be something else. Ice, Sand, Jungle, or some either purple-ish/crimson-ish place. Ignore that for now. Those are evil places.

All these biomes has there themed enemies, trees, loots, music, background, blocks, etc.

There are special ones tho. That purple/crimson biome is the most deadly place early game. The [Corruption](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/The_Corruption) and the [Crimson](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/The_Crimson). 

And that's a little spoiler-ish but if and when you get a gravitation potion you should check the sky. You will be surprised.

And finally the [Underworld](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/The_Underworld). It has powerful enemies and lava. Lots of lava. You might get burned if you go there. Might!

&gt;-----------------------------

[Ores](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Ores):

Now if you travel a little either on the surface or underground, there will be shining ores in the stone. You can mine them with your [pickaxe](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Pickaxes). Melt them down at the [furnace](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Furnace) and make equipment, or you just craft bricks and walls from the ores. The more powerful your pickaxe is, the less time will be needed to mine ores.

There is really not much to say about them. You mine them and smelt them.

&gt;-----------------------------

[Accessories](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Accessory) and [weapons](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Weapons) and tools and [armors](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Armor) and such:

But what shall one do in order to mine some tougher ores underground. Easy. Pickaxes! and its varieties (Drills). The deeper an ore is the stronger pickaxe will you need. Usually the tooltips will tell you what it ca mine.

Now you must have realized that there are those squishy green/blue colored gel things. You use your weapon to slay them ~~in the name of [Cthulhu](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Eye_of_Cthulhu)~~, because it is either you or them.

But you have other options to slay the evil creatures of your world: Swords, throwing weapons, bows, lances, cannons, magic weapons, AND a sword which shoots explosive, bouncing, rainbow cats... Now I got you.

Most of them are crafted at an [anvil](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Anvil), some (mainly spellbooks) at a Bookcase or at other places. They have various effects, damage, knockback, mana use(magic weapons), range; like... in every other game.

Though we have powerful weapons our enemies will tear us apart without proper gear. I order to stay alive you must increase your defence. And this is exactly what armors are for! There are various armor sets in Terraria from wood to Vortex Armor. Each armor has some armor set bonus. These bonuses varies from type to type. They can give you melee speed, movement speed, bonus mana and many other things.

And Terraria also got many tools you can use, such as mechanical ruler, lifeform analyzer etc... you can equip them by right clicking on them. Then they will be equipped to one of the accessory slot. Some are requires to be equipped some or not(that's for the infomative equips like the lifeform analyzer).

But there are tons of other stuff other fun stuff in the game.

&gt;-----------------------------

By now you must have seen that [Jake/Maxvell or whatever his name guy](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Guide). You ask yourself: Who the ~~fuck~~ hell are you?! [He will be your guide](http://blog.smartthings.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/welcome-to-the-internet1.jpg). (Average scene in Hardmode)

He is one of the many [NPCs](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/NPC) you will encounter throughout your game. They (most of them) sell items, there are Town NPCs who are staying in your houses permanently and there are nomad ones like the Traveling merchant or the Skeleton Merchant whom will appear at random. Or they can give you quests like the Angler. They have some prerequisites to spawn, like increased health or money, or some kind of ammo. But I won't spoiler you the whole thing ;)

I think that's all about them. They help you and sell you things. They are dumb (there AI is pretty fcking out-of-date), can defend themselves and can interact with eachother. And they are people too! So please don't just lock them up in tiny cells!

&gt;-----------------------------

Nights and [Events](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Events):

Okay. So. The Sun is moving. There will be nightfall soon. By night you should have a house where you won't get killed by zombies and the other gangstas.

Either lock yourself up if you don't want to get disturbed. Or go out and kill them for their drops. ~~Almost every~~ Every enemy has some kind of item drop, be it accessory or weapon or anything. And/Or find some falling stars.

Now there are events that could happen at night. Such as a Blood Moon (""You can tell a Blood Moon is out when the sky turns red"" -- The Guide, and his infinite wisdom).

But no-no. It's not that easy. Things can happen during the day too. Like angry Goblins, or retro monster party, or Psychopathic Snowman attack.

Now there are random events: Goblins, Pirates; and seasonal events: Halloween and Christmas with their themed enemies and drops. And the ones that you must summon with some items like Snow Globe.

&gt;-----------------------------

[Bosses](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Events):

Night falls and a message appears: [""You feel an evil presence watching you...""](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Eye_of_Cthulhu) whoops. That ought to be the first and easiest(not easy for unexperienced players) boss of the game and you will have to fight with it. I will not tell you how now though. It kills the fun (pun intended). Now a little jump...

Hell yeah. Boss slain achievement get. Now. There are other more powerful bosses in the game. There are 6(7) Bosses at the beginning. After you slain one specific boss, The Wall of Flesh then you will be able to defeat 8 other not including event bosses and mini-bosses (11). That's 26 bad guys if I'm right. So a lot of fun awaits for you.

Now these Bosses either spawns by themselves (bad for you, can't prepare properly) or you can summon them with various summoning items like Suspicious looking eye or Mechanical worm which are crafted at altars found in the previously mentioned Corruption/Crimson biome. Underground.

Every boss has certain item drops: weapons, equipments, mounts, pets and other fun things. 

And if it's not enough you can fight MULTIPLE bosses at once. Hell yeah. If you can defeat the three Mechanical Bosses (spoiler!) then you will even get an achievement!

&gt;-----------------------------

Pre-Hardmode/Harmode:

So. The world are you is now in Pre-hardmode. Weak enemies, resting Corruption/Crimson. Life is all Rainbows and Unicorns. 

Remember the Wall of Flesh? If you want to make progress after a while you will crave for it's death. I think you will figure out eventually how it's summoned.

Once you defeated It JUST THEN will your life be all rainbows and unicorn because you will soon encounter a new biome called [The Hallow](http://terraria.gamepedia.com/The_Hallow) with fairies and other things.

In Hardmode everything will be harder and stronger. But hey! You will have totally new ores too for totally new and more powerful gears! 

My only advice is to be always prepared for a Boss fight and check the Jungle Undergroundd frequently because that's where the real shit is happening/will happen in Hardmode.",1467331319

"SonyXperia","t5_2y3ed","1. Your phone does not have viruses unless one of two things has happened. a) you are installing apps that are not from the app store and have explicitly enabled ""unknown sources"" in order to allow this to happen. Do not do this unless you developed the app yourself. b) Google has let an app that you installed from the store slip through its process. I have yet to see this happen. Either way, these apps must have been explicitly installed by you and you must have accepted the permissions.

2. A Virus does not usually slow down your system. Adware, some spyware and crapware slows down your system. A *virus* will infect your system in a way that is intended to not interfere with your use and will allow an attacker to perform malicious acts, most of which will not slow down your system. This is why things like Zeus went undetected for so long.

3. Those bullshit ""you've got a virus"" popups usually link to play store apps. The good thing about android is it is very obvious when you get the install button. Nothing can happen unless you click the install button.

4. If you are concerned, the best ""app"" is not an app at all. Just go into settings &gt; apps &gt; all apps and inspect them. Check their permissions and what they do.",1467331320

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","It's doable...more so for extract, PM or BIAB. 

It's less than ideal, but you could boil 2.5-3 gallons and add the rest of the water to bring you up to volume after the boil. That would help you to cool your wort faster too, especially if you refrigerate the rest of the water. That would save you from having to buy a new kettle. They can get crazy expensive. 

You can get an ""ale pail"" or similar brand fermentation vessel for cheaper than carboys. I only have 1 carboy and rarely use it because the buckets are easier to clean...and I don't really care what it looks like most of the time. I'm going to drink it anyway. 

I would get a (couple) fermentation buckets with lids and airlocks and a larger strainer with hooks and a handle that will cover the opening of the bucket. You probably don't need a funnel. Those few things could bring you up to $50+. If not throw in some extra hops or a ""kit."" Some of the kits on NB are pretty cheap.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Pull up a chair, breh.

That team he mentioned, Nirvana.Int, was one of the best Western teams ever.  It started as Ben's Friendly/Fuck Buddies with Fear, Demon, Merlini, Kuroky and Puppey.  Really, really cool team and as good as you'd expect with those players.  They got sponsored by blight, one of those really cancerous scammy orgs that infested early esports, then Nirvana.  The team had three main rivals.  

The first was the MYM Maelk/Mania/Pusher core, plus some combination of AngeL and miGGel or Playmate and Misery.  This was the team that went to TI1 as Maelk, Mania, Playmate, Demon and Misery.  They went to ESWC Paris with Babyknight, I think, and formed the core of the strong Denmark MYM Prime Nations teams.

The second rival was the various stacks built around Ducky under various names.  fnatic, enotHome, Ducky's Dream Team, Blight, LOST International... lots and lots.  The core of those teams was the Misery and Loda duo, with Misery generally playing carry and Loda playing mid, and Miracle on support.  Miracle was a Swedish player who'd been on the legendary Ks.int team with Kuroky; he and NS^ were the two best Western support players.  The final player was a bit inconsistent and Azen, miGGel, Santa and others played there.

The best Western team was the DTS team that gave us the core of TI1 Na'Vi.  Nirvana beat them occasionally, but not consistently enough.  ArtStyle, Dendi, Dread, NS^ and Light were the only team that realistically had a chance at beating the Chinese Big Three of EHOME, LGD.sGty and Nirvana.cn.  (To note here since it's appropriate: Nirvana Int, Nirvana China and Nirvana Malaysia were all under the same sponsor.  Nirvana CN was zhou, YaphetS, banana, DGC and incense, and Nirvana Malaysia was YamateH, Mushi, Ice, Net and XtiNcT.  Nirvana CN's apogee was winning WDC 2010, and Nirvana MY's was winning the Esports Thailand Cup over EHOME in a Bo1 where Mushi played the best Puck I've ever seen.)

One of the problems Nirvana.int had was that it was a split NA/EU team.  There were practice issues, I think, and Demon and Kuroky and Puppey just had a personality conflict.  Demon didn't handle direct criticism well, and Kuroky and Puppey tended I think to make things unnecessarily personal.  I know Ben's post talks about conflict between Demon and Puppey, but it was really conflict between Demon and Kuroky that broke the team up for good.  There's more information about the Puppey/Demon conflict here http://www.gosugamers.net/dota/news/11807-puppey-talks-about-nirvana-s-split including Fear playing elder statesman.  Basically, Demon goofed off, Puppey flamed, the team split and fought over which half was entitled to spots in ongoing tournaments including ESWC 2010, as well as money that the sponsor had promised.

ESWC 2010 was a tournament where 3/5ths of the roster had to be from one country.  Merlini retired right before the tournament, and Nirvana replaced him with the Russian player Azen.  Because they weren't eligible for the tournament, Kuroky and Puppey left Nirvana and formed TeamHome to compete for Russia's spot; the roster had pgg, Glody and Phe!V.  They didn't make it, though, losing to DTS, and Puppey rejoined Nv.int for the tournament, along with Korok as the last American.  Nv.int finished fourth, behind EHOME, DTS and MYM.

After the tournament Nirvana had good but not overwhelming results with Santa, Azen, Puppey, Demon and Fear.  Loveen stopped paying salaries and the team disbanded.  Demon and Fear went semi-inactive, popping up to play with MYM and LOST.Eu respectively.  Azen, Puppey and Santa joined Kuroky and Pajkatt, I think, to create the first iteration of GGnet; Puppey eventually left for Na'Vi.  Santa and Pajkatt were booted or left and Kuroky went to TI1 with Azen, Miracle (Mirakel), Kev- and Kebap.  

So there you go.  A brief snippet of Western Dota history.  IF you want I'll tell you about the one other time Troll Warlord was briefly in the meta, and how there was a big maphacking thing around a player named after a cartoon elephant and what things used to be like, when pro players flamed each other in GosuBet comments.",1467331322

Unfortunately for me, my Crohn's came back a little less than a year later and with a vengeance. On the bright side, Humira has kept me relatively stable. If this is your first surgery, the odds are in your favour that you'll have a long period of remission. For whatever reason, having a prior surgery increases your chances of recurrence after subsequent surgeries. The absolute best advice is, if you're a smoker, you should quit.

If your disease is on the severe end, a combination of an anti-TNF with azathioprine appears to be effective in further increasing the odds that you'll remain in remission for a while.

Skill set:
Occ: Abyssal Artillery, Weakening Curse, Wyrd Reconstruction, Vulnerability Hex/Daemon's Pull
Jester: Harvest, Slice Off, Battle Ballad, Inspiring Tune
GR: Pick to the Face, Flashing Daggers, Thrown Dagger, Toxin Trickery
MAA: Crush, Rampart, Defender, Retribution

Occultist deals damage to the back row, heals, marks/pulls and can finish weak enemies with Weakening Curse. Or you could use it another way.

Jester can buff allies and annihilate the second and third row combined with Grave Robber's Flashing Daggers.

Grave Robber does what I said for the Jester. Annihilation.

Finally, Man-at-Arms is the tank, blocking, taking hits and deals damage to the front row enemies.",1467331325
"elderscrollsonline","t5_2tqi0","There are currently four different types of scaling which can occur. 

If you enter any of the Main Story, Fighters or Mages Guild quests, these will scale all content and rewards within these quests to your current character level at the time of doing the quest.

Entering any of the DLC zones, Wrothgar, Hews Bane and Gold Coast will scale your character up to CP150 which means you can play the DLC with all players regardless of level. 

Dungeons currently scale to group leaders level.

And in Cyrodiil/Imperial City you are battle levelled which applies to everyone regardless of level but is stronger on lower level characters. The easiest thing to notice here is that you gain significantly more health, magicka and stamina.

The update coming in fall will be bringing scaling to the whole of Tamriel so that you can explore anywhere with anyone and not be under levelled.

"CasualConversation","t5_323oy","As a start, you are under no obligation to respect your elders. Respect is something we show each other over time - it is not a given. Also, it's shit getting older and realising that the people we used to look up to aren't so great. We've got to learn to allow them to be human; which means accepting them in the whole as good *and* bad (similar to how we'd want someone to see us). When people get to a certain age they start to seem regressive. Their cognitive capacities start to diminish and they, basically, become more childlike. This means they can sometimes become a bit more work to deal with.

Primarily though, try not to be so hard on yourself for not respecting her like you wish you could (or as you once did). Like I say, it's not compulsory. You can't just respect someone for being old if you don't also respect their actions or views. You're just as human as everyone else. Maybe your irritation is stemming somewhat from the dissonance created by your ideals ('respecting your elders') conflicting with the reality (you don't find her respectable). Such conflict generally requires a shift of behaviour or belief. Now, you can't shift her behaviour since we can't really control other people (and it can be frustrating to try), but you can shift your own perspective that it's an external force that needs changing. Maybe instead the conflict can be resolved by accepting you don't find her respectable.

"audiophile","t5_2qmiy","The Hawksford study you linked needs to be disqualified for several reasons:

First off, listening level isn't controlled for, so there is no guarantee that the difference isn't merely in identifying the differing noise floor.

The bit and sample rate conversion is not controlled for.  There are pretty huge variations in the performance of sample rate converters, as evidenced by [these measurements](http://src.infinitewave.ca/) [1] and without having characterized the performance of one, the paper is pretty much only testing the performance of the sample rate converter itself.  

Going further, the Hawksford study is not controlled for audible intermodulation artifacts - something I hardly even think people thought of in 1997.  (This is also a general criticism of the entire meta analysis - systems trying to reproduce ultrasonics, without being capable can demonstrably yield audible, and _measurable_ artifacts, and any study that doesn't control for it is basically completely invalid)

---
[1] Yes, I realize that straight up integer multiples of sample rates are ""simpler"" to deal with, but there's always the possibility of it not being a proper control.  You'd want to test using multiple converters to see if the data holds any validity at all.  I have several 10/10 results in an ABX going from 24/96 to 24/48 myself, because I tested with a substandard SRC. Once I tested with a different sample-rate converter, I miserably ""failed"" the same test on the same test material.",1467331328

Secondly this country still has a very high rate of gun ownership.  If carrying guns around made us safer then you would expect to see us safer than countries with a low rate of gun ownership.  This is not what we see.  
 
Thirdly if carrying guns around made us safer then we would expect to see a large number of criminals killed in self defense compared to accidental shootings and suicides.  We see about 300 criminals killed each year in self defense shootings, a number that is dwarfed by the number of accidental shootings and suicides.  Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the gun owners stand a stronger chance of killing themselves with their gun than shooting a criminal.

"Shave_Bazaar","t5_2srzg","That sounds like a very expensive price. I've never paid more than $30 for a Damaskeene. Even if it's perfect and cased, $50 should be top dollar.

That said, just because it's a Damaskeene doesn't mean it'll shave better than a normal 1912. Think of Damaskeene as a brand or a date code. It just means the razor was made 1915-ish to 1918-ish if it says CO on the back and 1918-20 if it says CORP. In about 1921 they dropped the Damaskeene brand but the razor didn't change. Think of Damaskeene as a date code, not a different razor.

What makes the difference in the shave is the curved top cap vs flat top cap. Curved or flat tops came on all years of the 1912, regardless if it's a Damaskeene or not. Curved top cap is *slightly* smoother and *slightly* less efficient than the flat top.",1467331328

I don't think that most bitcoiners appreciate what the real challenge is, in terms of getting bitcoin to money status; and that all these other issues, especially technical problems to solve, pale in comparison; in terms of difficulty and in terms of their overall importance.

There is a reason that, worldwide, most monies are (at least initially) creations of a government or centralized monetary authority;  and I personally do not believe that the reason for that is simply because fiat is a better way to do it or that those monies are somehow better than gold or bitcoin.  It is, in fact, because public goods problems and related failures are indeed a real thing, and a daunting challenge to overcome; even without persecution; but certainly bitcoin faces future persecution and also the crowding out effect that comes with, not only the inertia of incumbent fiat monies, but their nature as being *enforced* into their position.",1467331331

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Scientists have long known about gravitons, a particle predicted by the Standard Model that is at the base of gravity. What is new is the discovery of a way to control gravitons. Much like scientists can  shoot electrons, neutrinos or photons (other particles predicted by the standard model), they have now learned how to control gravitons.

They use the new graviton gun to shoot gravitons at an object, having the effect of making that object heavier. They use the new graviton sucker to suck gravitons out of objects to make them lighter where they seem to float through the air.

BTW, Both the graviton gun and the graviton sucker have been here for some time, but if you get to area 51 to actually see one, they will shoot you with the graviton sucker and you simply float off into space. It was also extensively tested in the Bermuda triangle, where many boats were sunk by making them too heavy to float.",1467331332

If he did mean that was the survival rate, then he is demonstrably wrong.  The best research teams that I know of studying this, at least in the United States, is Dr. Burts' studies at Northwestern and the studies at Johns Hopkins.  There has not been a single death in any of those studies, phases II and III (phase III is still ongoing for both I believe).

There were in fact more deaths in the earlier treatments of HSCT therapy, but the process has come a long way since then.  For one, they no longer do full body irradiation, and also they are doing non-myeloablative treatment, which is much safer.",1467331335

Consider this example. Say I am a writer. I shouldn't *desire* fame and money-- those are not good things. Things happen as they are. And I might not get fame and money. Those aren't goals. I ought to be content with what I have. Now, that doesn't mean I ought to disregard moral rules. To be a virtuous writer, I would try to be the best writer I can; thus, some rules to achieve that include: express things eloquently and clearly, work constantly at improvement, never have a moment of idleness. And, I would also have responsibilities as a human being: to be rational, to study philosophy, to assist others. These are more than mere guidelines. These are what right and wrong hinge on. To break that rule-- say, by having an entire day without work-- is to act immorally. It is to act in a way that is not virtuous. I can and should act better. 

And no matter what happens, I should keep those rules constant. Even if I barely make enough of an income to get by, I shouldn't stop studying philosophy. Even if I can't afford nice luxuries, I  shouldn't stop helping others. 

So there isn't a contradiction. Accept what happens to you, without letting it affect your will. And constantly work to be the best person you can be. The two are separate things.",1467331336

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The basement stood as a testament to the value of quality construction. Bleak cement walls and an unfinished ceiling from which water often dripped. Wiring problems dictated that all light came from weak battery powered lamps. The dank atmosphere almost felt deadly, but at the same time gave rise to the lower forms of life, moss, mould, mosquitos, all the worst ""m""s of the english language. If someone's introduction to the house began with the basement, they would most likely assume the home is either abandoned or is the den of wastrels and degenerates, assuming they did not run away first. Because people rarely saw the basement first, they had no way of expecting it, and often experienced deep perturbation upon seeing the dungeon-like pit. But, once recovering from the shock, they often asked, ""why leave the basement like that?""


""Why leave the basement like that?"" usually merited little more than a grunt from Errol, the home's sole denizen. And that was most often that. Few people noticed any major peculiarities about Errol, and so they were content to write this one off. But still, some could not shake the question. It killed market value, wasted space, endangered the house, and just, ""why?"" Granted, slightly superficial and superfluous ""whys"" crop up frequently when home-ownership is involved, so Errol did his best to shake off the needles pricking into his otherwise picturesque life. Already an associate at a major investment bank at the age of 24, and owning his own house in a nice Westchester neighborhood, to most, all that he needed was a beautiful wife and 2.5 kids, and inroads were being made in that department, and, of course, a finished basement. But, after a few months, people gave up on Errol's basement, and accepted it as the unsightly part of his life, everyone has something, and the neighborhood only functioned by letting those parts lie. 


On a random Friday night, Errol found himself sitting on the sofa with a woman he met at bar near the office earlier that night. Although, unlike most of his ""acquaintances,"" who also lived in his world, she was the bartender. Something about her ensnared him, a glint in her eye and the way she carried herself despite her servile role, that said she was more than that and knew it. Once they got to talking, he learned that in the light of day, she spent her time a little further uptown, studying for her mfa in painting at Parsons. Somewhere around ten, he was just drunk enough to invite her up to Westchester, and she was just drunk enough to accept. At first, they talked incessantly, finding the related to and complimented each other well. But then, things petered off, and Kate found herself unable to comport herself with the work in which Errol lived, the structured, vicious, and ultimately meaningless work of shuffling, not creating. Yet, all the same, she saw something about him, the something that kept her from rebuffing his initial advance, as she usually did to the over-confident investment bankers who frequented her place of work. She wanted to dig that out, but could not get under the well-dressed exterior. Her frustration over the mystery of Errol combined with the alcohol still in her system had her almost in tears by the time they arrived at Errol's house. 


He could sense what she though of him, what she wanted to think of him, what she wanted to find in him. Initially, it rendered him useless. Whereas the suave persona that enable his career success almost always led to comparable success in his off-hours, Kate flummoxed him. But, pushing through this, he decided to take a risk, and show her the most hidden part of himself. After entering the home, he said, ""I want to show you the basement.""


""What?"" Kate said, thinking that showing off his house was a little out of the blue.


""Come on, you'll love what you see,"" he said, leading her to the door. The darkness had little affect on her, nor was she phased by the moistness in the air. She followed him without issue, although she would in hindsight wonder why she let some strange guy take her into his shadowy basement, which would have been to a sober Kate a little more American Psycho than she was comfortable with. Once down, he shined a light on the wall, which bore an expansive mural, as beautiful as it was unexpected. It showed multiple scenes, the New York skyline, a pristine beach, a verdant forest, and everything in between as one melted into the other."" 


""What is this?"" She said, baffled.


""I've lived in this neighborhood my entire life, been your average upper middle-class guy my entire life, only diverging during a brief high school rebellious phase. Back then, this house was owned by an elderly woman. She never did anything with the basement because she could not get down here. So I did something with it. I would sneak in through the little window over there and work on this. I had assumed it would eventually be destroyed, but five years ago the woman died, and her son got the house, but he lives in Oregon and just left it here. When I realized that the mural still stood, I bought the house. I can't really say for sure why I did it, I think a combination of a desire to do something illegal, being a stupid teenager, but also I wanted to create something, to do something weird and beautiful, so this happened.""


""But why leave it? There are ways to preserve it, instead of leaving it in this musty old space. Even build up the rest of the basement around this beauty.""


""At first, that was my plan, but now, this has become my lifeline, my connection to the part of me that can make something like this. When painting my mural was the only time I ever really felt connected to that Errol. I want this to be natural, to live and die as nature does, or at least as much as that can happen in a manmade basement. Business Errol has done a lot to kill off artistic Errol, but he can't touch this, he has no power here. I don't want to disappear, and this way, I never will.""

It's not a ""Smite is on the downturn"" kind of thing, it's more just disproving the evidence that Smite is still growing. It's not, and Hi-Rez has always had a huge issue with player retention. As I've said, it's cause for concern, and if Hi-Rez isn't concerned about it, they're being phenomenally short-sighted.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","""You know, I never quite understand of these animatronics, Phil. They're always so glitchy and barely cooperate with the workers."" John said during his weekly talk with Phil, who was the oldest worker of Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. ""Yes, yes, yes, I know,"" John repeated as he sipped his coffee. ""I had problems with them a bunch of times, but I managed to get through.""

""How?""

""Often I reboot their systems if they get in trouble with the customers. The boss states that no incidents must happen during the customer's time here. In fact, barely anyone has a good time here. They're just too scared."" Phil took another sip of coffee, his arm shaking. It was obvious that he had something kept secret.
""P-Phil, what's wrong?"" said John as he landed his hand on Phil's shoulder.

""Nothing's wrong, John. Go back and clean the backstage for me, will ya?"" Still quivering, Phil slowly walked away into a dark, cold room. John's curiousity skyrocketed and he followed him all the way. After a brief moment, Phil stopped, and look straight onto a strange suit. It was different than the rest. To the left lies some animatronic parts, a blue bonnie, a beakless Chica, a strange red-cheeked Freddy, and a pink and white Foxy. Then, John starts to remember, about an old Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, filled with these animatronics, until it closed a few weeks after. Minutes went by as Phil kept staring at the suit. It was fairly like the Bonnie character, but all yellow and missing parts of its ear.

After nearly a half an hour waiting for movement, Phil left, without even noticing John clear-eyed. He went towards the Bonnie suit, remembering that it was a spring-lock suit, the wearable ones. He didn't, however, remember that they were broken and can kill those who wear it within mere minutes. With that, John put on the suit, fitting him perfectly. Minutes onto wearing the suit, John left the dark room. No one but Phil and him were in the pizzeria, and the clock was just about to hit 6 AM. Perhaps, people can wear these suits once again, to bring back the love the kids once had. Ding dong, said the clock, and no more than 10 kids and their parents entered the doors, all questioned the spring-lock suit. John greeted them as if he was an animatronic himself, the kids cheering and the parents happy.

But then, John felt a slight boing sound, which silenced the whole crowd. More sounds followed along, and within a minute, John felt the entire suit digging into his flesh, blood splattering out of the seams. The children screamed and cried, the parents running with their children, while John fell on the floor, blood still gushing out. Out the bathroom door came Phil, who seems happy.

""I told ya. Shouldn't mess with them...""

He walked out, and John was left dead like a squirrel on a street. The next day, no families dared to set foot in the restaurant, and it closed the day after. John was put into the same room which he found the springlock suit, and was never heard from again...

*Until 30 years later.*

"unchartedmultiplayer","t5_35mkp","In my opinion I think this would be the best solution and keeps things from getting too stale:

Daily Challenges:

This needs a major change. One challenge per day isn't enough. Add more challenges (there isn't any headshot challenges, as far as I know, or streak challenges, etc) to keep things interesting. 

Next they need to give us a daily rotation of 3 challenges and have a weekly challenge that can be something a bit more grindy to work towards. 

Winning games should give 20, losing games can be awarded 10. 

Ranked matche:

Bronze - Silver tier: Same as regular TDM payout

Gold tier: 25 per win, 10 per loss

Platinum: 30 per win, 10 per loss

Diamond tier: 35 per win, 15 per loss 

Master rank: 40 per win, 20 per loss. 

As for ranking up through normal play, they could add a payout of 50 relics every level, with a bonus at every 5.

This election can be unpredictable, but I always take it back to 2012 - even near the end, they were polling at a combined 7%, which is still substantial. How much did they get total on election day? 1.4%. That's why I don't buy into any of these ridiculous numbers for the two of them.

I think that the percussion isn't quite the right style for the song. They sound very electronic (in more of a glitch kind-of-way than 80s for example), and I have a soft spot for drums that at least sound somewhat acoustic.

After about halfway through, the vocals get lost in the mix a little bit; I think you should remove either the guitar or the strings there (or at least rewrite the parts so that they harmonize a bit more).

You are a newspaper CEO, really the entire board of directors and all the corporate officers of the company. If your website insists on NoAdBlocker software or they don't serve you pages, then if your website infects a visitor to your site, it is a $100,000 statutory judgment against you, all of you cited above; not collectively, but each of you individually. There is no negotiated settlement; it is a statutory judgment; pay up or go to prison for contempt of court until you do pay up. There is no discount for anything. There is no discharge via bankrupcy. All familial (community property) assets are considered valid sources. There is no evasion via trusts; you created a skip-generation trust, too bad its gone; you created a remainder trust, too bad its gone too with all the tax ramifications falling on your head. If it is good enough for the entertainment industry, then it is good enough to protect the interests of the average citizen.

Then there is the criminal charge under the CFAA (USC 18 p. 1030); the crime is punishable by a mandatory sentence of 35 years in federal SuperMax, not some ClubFed. Aaron Schwartz, this one is for you, Sir.

Beyond the first case, it will never ever happen again.

A villain gets introduced that is very flat and is never properly explained (at least not in a fashion that satisfied me). Also more poor decision making is made although it doesn't go along with the theme.

Ultimately I wouldn't say it got better, I liked the poor decision making at the start because it made sense. That humanity was wary of their own people because of mistrust and they would learn to trust each other and band together to defeat the Kabane. Internal conflict was not the solution but cooperation was. That was the direction that the show seemed to be going early on but it got derailed.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;That's an overly broad definition that could easily include paedophilia.

The reason pedophilia is forbidden is that we, as a society, think it's damaging for adults to engage in sexual behavior with children - largely because we see it as inherently coercive.  That factor isn't inherently present in incest.

&gt;the article clearly points out that the motivation behind these laws is protecting sisters and daughters from being forced into relationships with abusive fathers and brothers and to dissuade people with a high risk of having children with genetic mutations from reproducing. It isn't simply a question of it being ""gross"".

These types of abusive and coercive relationships are already criminal, incestuous or not.  As for the genetic concerns, there are currently no laws preventing people from reproducing regardless of likelihood of genetic disease. Additionally, it's not clear why incest is verboten but [Ashkenazi Jews](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tay%E2%80%93Sachs_disease#Epidemiology) are allowed to marry.

I personally found it very difficult to make a decision, and early on made the realisation that the political campaigns were such a mess of lies and vested interests that nothing being said could be trusted. I therefore did my own research on the issue, learned a lot about the topic, and went from there.

From my perspective the EU grants us a lot of advantages, especially for the economy, but also for funding for things like the sciences. We also get more power on the international stage and the benefits of skilled workers.

On the other hand though, those in control of the EU at the higher levels - the Commission for example - are not elected and not accountable. If the public want a law amended and the commission refuses there seems to be absolutely nothing that anyone can do about it. That's a very big problem and something in desperate need of reform, but I'm yet to see any indication that these folks are at all open to meaningful reform. The primary goal of the EU as it stands appears to be expansion and consolidation of power, which doesn't actually work to the advantage of the member states.

Even when it comes to planning - we're still at the mercy of the EU. Expecting a comprehensive roadmap isn't really the point because of that, and so the debate was more about whether the economic benefits of the EU are worth tolerating a wasteful and poorly structured political authority. It can quite easily go both ways.",1467331355

It's natural to be confused and there's no reason to be ashamed (not that you said you were, just reinforcing the idea). Take your time and don't worry about labels like gay or straight. Especially since there are so many stereotypes that go along with those labels that'll only make you more confused.

Additionally you said you're only 19, you're not gonna have everything figured out. Hell, I'm 22 and I'm not even close to the person I was three years ago.

Finally, some specific advice for you: don't be afraid of these feelings, repressing them will only do more harm then good. It sounds to me that a sense of loneliness might be affecting you. The desire for affection and the desire for  platonic companionship can easily get jumbled up. Another possibility is that you might be bisexual.

Now, someone else correct me if I'm wrong but OP *could* replace the entire wire with a proper double-insulated cord, right?

*****
&gt; The Iraqi military provided different numbers, saying coalition and Iraqi forces destroyed a total of 750 ISIS vehicles in the two convoys and killed hundreds of ISIS militants.

&gt; The airstrikes come days after the Iraqi military announced that its troops had seized Falluja from ISIS. The city was liberated Sunday after the military recaptured the last neighborhood in Falluja, said Lt. Gen. Abdul Wahab al-Saadi, commander of the liberation of the city.

&gt; Part of the group stayed with the vehicles and the others headed to Baghdad. ISIS forces soon swept across the southern Falluja corridor, with a convoy of 450 ISIS vehicles passing by the stuck trucks, Willingham wrote.

Give value to filled redstone frame for example, if that is only component that doesn't already have value. That causes a mathematical chain reaction that gives resonant cell an EMC value too.

1 of such raw items, if i remember right, was stone slab. Because it would actually value for 0.5 it doesn't normally have any then. There's hardly any harm done setting it to 1. If one were to abuse that, it would make for a slowest EMC maker ever invented.",1467331359

I lived in Atlanta for a few years and worked at a humble furniture store just making a living and my parents shamed me until I came back. 

I know that sounds pathetic and some people can just ignore their family and do their thing but it's like this intrinsic obligation and guilt built into me. It would destroy my parents if I moved away and, in there eyes, ""rotted away my potential"". 

The family would talk. Ask what I'm doing constantly. It's miserable. So I moved back and took a job that I didn't love but was alright. 

I dream of moving away and leaving it all
Behind. Chasing something I want and living life my way, but it's just not that simple. It's more complicated than just leaving. The guilt I feel is really strong, they gave me so much how can I just spite them and live life in a way they don't approve?",1467331364

"wow","t5_2qio8","&gt; The bad behavior of a few poorly-raised assholes who never learned consideration for others is not a game design problem.

It is when the game encourages it by being way to easy. I think MoP was a decent balance. WoDs LFRs are just way to easy.

&gt;An individual, maybe even two or three depending on the group could AFK at any raid difficulty. The difference is an actual/organized group would throw their asses out. LFR players need to be better about kicking the dead weight. 

The problem is at certain points it becomes impossible to kick the dead wait. And you can have a lot of people be AFK in LFR, way to many. The point I was making though is that any player can sneak into LFR and finish the game, you could possibly do that on other difficulties but chances are that you will be kicked. And I don't know of a single game outside of current WoW that allows you to not play the game to ""beat it"". I think fatboss, although being a little harsh, is correct on that.

&gt;And, yes, in this case it's the elitist hardcore ""pro"" gamers who are the dead weight. It doesn't matter how good a player is - or thinks they are - if they're not doing their part.

[[HD] BTS Calvin Klein Watches +Jewelry 2015 Campaign (Kim Woo Bin.Anna Jagodzińska.)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=lZE8TT2iaTU)|[4](https://reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/4qlwqv/_/d4tzzp7?context=10#d4tzzp7) - Korea has been the most based Asian country ever since Hallyu took off. You usually only see AMWF ads like these ones in Korea. China and Japan sadly produce more WMAF ads than AMWF ads for some reason.

"TrollYChromosome","t5_2tvh2","Never said it did.  Call yourself whatever you want I don't care, say whatever you want on the internet, I don't care. But don't lie to me and tell me you are X when you are Y and expect me to just go along with it.

Also I am an obese fat ass. So yes, not only do I call myself out on it, but I call anyone out on their bullshit. However that is ONLY when someone is trying to tell me that they are something when they are not.  Personally I prefer living in reality rather than deluding myself into in-action. Secondly I know plenty of people who are fat with TONS of body confidence, no reason for them to be mutually exclusive.",1467331367

He is a good military leader and a good fighter but lacks the political intelligence, which is very understandable given both his father and mother are not at the level of Tywin or little finger in that regard. Sansa was what? 13 or 14 at the time she moved to the KL. None of the things that happened, like moving to the KL with Ned as the hand, playing the game and ultimately being at war... are not in any of the Starks' mind a few weeks prior to that. They are not ambitious for the throne and all they trained their kids was to be lords who manage the land and military and ladies who takes care of the family. Thats a very different education from the one, say, Cersei had.",1467331368
"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","This person reminds me of a woman I met many years ago. The short version of her life story was that she came from (at least) an upper middle class family, attended private (Catholic) schools all her life, and got her first job as a librarian right out of grad school.

In her entire life she had never been in a situation where people didn't listen to her or treat her as if her thoughts and opinions had merit. Never. Her parents always discussed things with her. Her teachers. No one ever shot her down in her entire life.

So she goes to work someplace and expects the head of the library to listen to her when she doesn't agree with a policy. The whole ""shut your hole and do what you are told"" rule had never been drilled into her.

She got angrier and angrier, more and more aggressive, and kept changing departments to ones where she thought she would be treated better only to find they didn't listen to her there either.

She eventually quit. Married a guy who made enough money to support both of them on his income.

So, apparently ""good parenting"" can create some serious adjustments to real life later on.",1467331368

None of our DNA is really that unique.  If you have some mutation which gave you an awesome ability then, by all means, reproduce like crazy.  Otherwise, the ""need"" to pass on DNA is simply based on a tradition that tells you it's important.  

&gt;You have children to pass on your legacy both genetically and culturally

Maybe that's the reason if you're trying to build an empire.  To me, this seems like a terrible reason to have kids.  

I definitely want kids some day.  It has absolutely nothing to do with some desire to have future generations adopt my name, culture, or traditions.  I want kids because family enriches our lives.  I want the experiences and memories that go along with it.  I think I'd be a great dad.  I want all of that stereotypical parenting stuff.  Little league games, homework, fights, teen drama, family vacations, college stress, etc.  And then when I'm old, I can spend time with my family, reminiscing about all of the good times.  I couldn't care less whether my kids share my last name or if we keep the traditions I grew up with, adopt someone else's, or invent new ones.  ",1467331369

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","Early Childhood curriculum is preschool, and they make shit for money because they are not required to get degrees. Most places require 30 units of ECE units. In other words, one year of school to learn how to deal with little people and make sure they know their ABCs when they head off to kindergarten. 

I'm a teacher. My degree was not ""easy,"" though it was certainly less difficult than engineering, I'm sure. I had to get my bachelors first (Liberal Studies) and then get my teaching credential- another year and a half program. Liberal Studies covered a little bit about many things (economics, literature, history [both U.S and world], health, a science [bio for me], psychology, polysci, etc), and then I went on to get my k-8 teaching credential that focued on laws, theories, practices, etc of education. 

My starting salary (after subbing for a year and a half making 90$/day on days the districts even needed subs) was $22k a year. I had to work summers. I now have 16 years experience plus 50 post credential credits, (and am currently in grad school), and I make 45k a year. I still have to work summers. When I complete my masters I'll be making 52k. I will work summers. The topmost earner on our salary schedule can make 84k. That's with a doctorate and 35 years of experience.

Yes, while ""diff eq"" is ultimately more difficult, those engineers will get their first job making double what I do after 16 years, and are not required to get more education as they gain more experience. Furthermore, while I may not know how to differential shit, I bet the guy who can wouldn't be able to pass my biology class.

It is quite likely the servers will get overloaded, and you may struggle to get activated, or you may get upgrade issues, and you may miss the boat.

You can revert to old OS even in years ahead if you reinstall from scratch.  

Rollback is pretty poor anyway, so the best option is to make a system image backup of your current install using either windows own tool, or a quality 3rd part tool (I strongly recommend Macrium Reflect Free).  You can restore image backups at any time in the future.

You can also install windows 10 as dual boot (on new drive, in virtual hard drive, separate partition etc).

Theresa May se présente, c'est Thatcher v2 (La première faisait mal, elle c'est bien plus qu'une dame de fer, elle a plusieurs blindages en plus!) elle a certainement un plan tout prêt.
 Le pire c'est qu'elle était contre le Brexit et est pro Européenne.
-L’opposition se fait incendier. Les conservateurs essayent de faire dégager Jeremy Corbyn qui bloque un peu le passage.
-Boris se replie la queue entre les jambes, il a trop fait de conneries, il est punie, il a entraîné Thérésa de l'autre côté.
-Merkle semble lâcher un peu de Leste et semble être plus conciliante.
Dans la presse Allemande et Britanique ils annonce que Helmut Kohl averti l'Europe. (Pouquoi pas dans les médias Français?) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jun/30/helmut-kohl-warns-eu-leaders-one-step-back-after-brexit-vote 
Il semblerait que la presse Française est souvent muselé.
Flamby reste ferme avec ses conviction et risque de faire sauter l'ensemble des relations bilatérales avec l'Allemagne si il joue trop avec le feu.
Tout le monde veut piller ""La city"" et encourager les banques à venir.
Mais en France, il y a toutes les grèves et les manifestations par rapport a la loi travaille. Donc c'est pas très attirant pour les investisseurs...

Il ne faut pas oublier que les élections en France et en Allemagne approchent à grands pas. Leurs chefs d'états vont prochainement être très occupé.
L'Europe allait mal bien avant le référendum du Brexit, l'UE veut une fédération alors que chaque pays se bat pour son bout de gras.
De plus, sur les fondations il y a le couple Franco-Germanique qui s'impose sur
tout les autres états.
De ce fait, ça deviens moins intéressant pour tout les autres états, il n'y a pas d'égalité possible à cause des fondations même de l'Europe.
Le plus gros danger du moment c'est l'effet domino. L'UE essaye désespérément d'éteindre le feu. C'est le moment de refaire l'Europe et c'est ce qui est entrain de se produire.

But anyone who has worked in any software development lifecycle will know this glitch was an intentional omission.  First off, we know that EA developers know how to correctly apply chemistry to players...just look at day one players.  Second, this type of omission could never...EVER pass QA. This is integral functionality into what makes FUT unique.  Transactions and card-to-user relationships are logged in a DB somewhere.  You could easily tell if stat boosts are logged to non-day 1 cards just by running a simple script.  This is not rocket science and again, EA has proved they know how to do it with day 1 players.  Third, what we have done by exposing this glitch is give EA a clear way to hard code in a fix for this very specific step over situation.  They can easily not fix the fundamental problem and just code around this ""defect"" and we would be none the wiser.  Until they release their calculations and formulas for chemistry the community will always be in the dark.  

Lastly, I want to say that I think EA has an easy way out of this.  Without telling us what went in to chemistry or how it's calculated, they have a pretty easy legal ""out"" I would assume.  Anyone expecting some sort of drastic compensation I think is going to be disappointed.",1467331380

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","There were a lot of disingenuous claims made, predominantly by the leave campaign. In fairness though, they were picked apart too, it's just that the electorate largely failed to understand that disection. It was a victory for ignorance

It was also a stupid vote to hold, and largely down to one man's vanity, and his struggle to manage a long standing bleeding wound. Europe has always been a dry and technical debate that the public had little appetite for. It never ranked highly in the public consciousness of issues. It was really the preserve of a vocal minority of influential fanatics. It should never have been entrusted to the general public. It always had the capacity to be converted into a base currency denominator like immigration, and even the economic arguments could be degraded. It's difficult to scare minimum wage workers in Middlesborough with a threat that a vote for leave will cost finance workers at JP Morgan their jobs. ""Good - see how they like it"", would be the prevailing sentiment to that one, and I'm afraid 'Remain' never understood that level of division, a division that many of them have helped author

It's a surreal time to be living through though. The country seems shell shocked. Every hour or so another major twist seems to appear. No one really knows what's coming next. Who starts the day in charge and who ends it etc? The body politik seems to be having a collective nervous breakdown

"Games","t5_2qhwp","As Atalanto said, Dark Souls seemed to have spawned from Metroidvania games - which are games like Metroid and Castlevania, action-platformer adventure games. DS has similar exploration to these games, you'd progress through an area, unlock shortcuts, return later in the game, they'll be gated by bosses, etc. Dark Souls really managed to take this into a 3D environment, unlike Castlevania Lord's Of Shadow. I mean, it's not a perfect replica of Metroidvania in 3D, but it's good. 

So, to call this ""2D Souls"" isn't really apt, it's more an evolution of classic Metroidvania. Just looking at it from this trailer, I'm not sure I agree, I'd need to see how it plays over a good few minutes to tell. Death's Gambit seems quite flat and linear, and the slow-paced Dark Souls-like combat wouldn't really make it an ""action-platformer"". This wouldn't scratch the Metroidvania itch for most people I'd assume. 

If you're not familiar with Metroidvania and the type of fast-paced action and what-not you'll find in one, compared to this title, check out some gameplay of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, etc. or even the spiritual successor to these classics, Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night. On the Metroid side, you can check out... Well, I was never into Metroid, so I don't know.

To use WK Ruling as an example. If you field Fatality Bounty Hunter and deal me 3 damage, you should get hit with 1 damage in return. Not Three. One. Just like that card says.

Also, an errata to make it continuous would work so it doesn't stack. At that point, VS becomes a normal, still playable card. I mean, it's a 3 cost ffs.. and at the moment, due to the ruling, it's completely broken. Far more broken than Bard.",1467331384

I urge you to watch youtube videos of people giving tutorials or lessons on any subject. Some videos are done well but over 90% of them could be typed out and preformed in a matter of seconds with simple directions.

Not necessarily. There isn't really anything up there for her except more land for the sake of more land.

&gt; If those guns were band

Although a lot of different firearms being fired at once do sound like a majestic symphony, I don't think they've ever been involved in a band.  *Banned* is an entirely different meaning.

&gt; You act like the Constitution was made by God's or something Jesus. There the same people that are passing laws today, they have flaws and can be wrong. Don't point to some words on a paper to justify madness.

Cool, let's take it to bashing religion even though that does not serve as a basis for any of the pro arguments at all.

&gt; ~~There~~ They're the same people that are passing laws today, they have flaws and can be wrong.

Sure, there are things that we could do better when it comes to firearms - but your own statements betray your lack of knowledge on multiple fronts:

&gt; If those guns were band he would of settled for a pistol or something much weaker

Have some [facts](https://www.quandl.com/data/FBI/WEAPONS11-US-Murders-by-Weapon-Type).  The number of homicides by rifles in 2014 were 248.  By hand gun it was 5562.  You aren't even focusing on the weapons most often used in any crime here, you're just pushing the same tired emotional argument that fall flat when confronted.  Let's really crank this up though, 1567 are *murdered* by knives.  People like you argue that further restricting specific rifles is going to solve all our problems, yet you omit that you are 6.3 times more likely to be stabbed to death than to be shot by the rifles you are seeking to regulate.

By all means though, tell me I'm wrong and that the constitution is a trivial piece of paper.  I'm fairly confident that you haven't read them.  You probably don't understand the meaning or context surrounding them.  Most importantly though, it's obvious you don't understand the cost it took to secure any of them - or how you maintain them as rights in the first place.

My suggestion, start with an English language text book then work your way up to history.  It's a lot more important than the people crying about their feels let on.",1467331387

It's viens are the roads and supply lines, the cities are the hearts pumping traffic in and out each day in the circulatory system of commerce, trade, and economics.  Finally in the last 20 years, a brain has been forming.  A huge interconnected network that will allow the 'body' to control all its inputs, efforts, and desires, in practically real time.

&gt; A Chechen national suspected of being the mastermind behind the deadly Istanbul airport terrorist attack, earlier received refugee status in Austria, which helped him to repeatedly avoid extradition to Russia on terror charges.

&gt; The fatal attack on the Istanbul airport that took lives of 44 people and left more than 230 injured was allegedly organized by Ahmed Chataev, a Russian citizen of Chechen origin, who joined Islamic State in 2015 and now fights in Syria, Turkish media report, citing police sources.

&gt; The eyed Istanbul airport attack mastermind was on a wanted list in Russia since 2003 for sponsoring terrorism, recruiting extremists and membership in a terrorist group, Russian media report.

That one is especially bad and there's a few people in there actually trying to discuss the ""old movies are pretentious"" bullshit with them...and I honestly don't know how they do it. I get exhausted when I think about trying to talk with those people.

They think they ""love movies"" and all that shit but they can't name anything out of their comfort zone.

I saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4qnonk/prisoners_2013_any_similar_movies/?st=iq2z0i57&amp;sh=1ec1523c) earlier and it kind of pissed me off...I even replied with a list of movies. They wanted recommendations for crime/thrillers and then went on to list all the ones they've seen. That list has a pretty basic theme besides genre, it's all generic Hollywood superstars with a few older, very basic movies thrown in. It's all very ""IMDB top 250"".  Someone even [replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/4qnonk/prisoners_2013_any_similar_movies/d4ukmub) ""Well, it looks like you've seen them all! Go watch a TV show!""

And the thing is...the movies I recommended (Bullitt, The Outfit) are pretty standard movies anyone should be familiar with. These aren't arthouse indie flicks made in Denmark...they all feature huge massive Hollywood superstars but no one has ever talked about them. I don't think my taste in movies is very deep...I love John Ford/John Wayne westerns, 70s action flicks with McQueen or Lee Marvin or John Casavettes...but if I were to mention them people's eyes would glaze over.

They're completely happy recommending Revanent or Hateful 8 to each other. If the camera moves around a lot or uses a shit ton of Dutch angles, well...that must be great cinematography!

I'm happy with trolling /r/movies and saving my dicussion for /r/flicks or /r/TrueFilm 

Lastly, someone posted a question looking for queer/non-hetero movies that **didn't** have romance in them. Someone recommended Captain America Winter Soldier with the reason being that Black Widow and Cap flirted but didn't hook up. They weren't doing it to be funny...they were dead serious.",1467331405

While I don't have these issues, when playing high quality tracks on my car's head unit from the aux, there isn't much umph to the sound.

Once you clear that stuff up and get the config right it is solid. Overall, it wasn't a difficult or terribly time consuming process. Maybe worse for customers that end up with tons of findings. We didn't have many. 

The only area where I was dissatisfied with how it performed was with infected docs. It just didn't have that feature a while back. It was in the pipeline when we started rolling out and is available now.

Few things though...you will need to either shave the #6 runner on the intake manifold, and bend the #6 pipe on the exhaust manifold to get it to clear, maybe 1/4"" total.  Also, in 99 there are two different gaskets for the intake/exhaust.  For me, the 99 gasket didn't line up, and I had to use either a 98 or 00 gasket...can't remember.  After having had it on for a year, and wheeling the crap outa my jeep in that time...I can say that it has held up nicely.

Edit:

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","This has kind of been mentioned by /u/SilverNeurotic, but let me give a different take on how to solve this.

You need to go to your boss with a list of what tasks you have on your plate that he's previously given you that are non-junk related.  Then show him that ""If you ask me to pick up stuff, then X, Y and Z will get delayed.  Every time you ask me to do junk stuff, all of that gets pushed back.""  

If he says ""That is acceptable, we can push those back because Junk needs to get done"", then you're out of luck and finding a new position might be necessary.  

If he agrees that Junk shouldn't get in the way of X, Y and Z, then you have ammunition for the next time he asks you to get Junk done.  Just say ""OK, I can do that, but remember that X, Y and Z will be delayed because I'm taking care of something less important.""

Make your manager to manage your time well.  Sometimes bosses don't realize that the thing that's important RIGHT NOW will delay something that's going to be important a week from now.  If you stay on the same page with your boss, it'll make both of your lives easier.",1467331425

"biggreenegg","t5_2s3tb","BGE is better known because they have been in the game in the USA for many decades (since the late 1970’s).

Eggheads are like members of any other cult.

However, BGE kamados are not superior to other ceramic grills. They are far inferior to Komodo Kamados for instance (but that is also true for every other cermaic kamado currently on the market).

BGE warranty is no different or any better than the warranties offered by Kamado Joe, Primo, Vision and some other players.

I’d actually say that the BGE warranty is inferior to the Kamado Joe warranty. Kamado Joe will send replacement parts directly to your home free of charge. BGE will send out replacement parts for free IF you want to pick it up from your dealer whenever they get in their next shipment of stuff. If you want BGE to send a replacement part to your house they charge for shipping.

BGE seems to be coasting along on their past reputation. Kamado Joe seems to be the up and comer that is bringing along a lot of innovation lately - one example is the Joetisserie (which is actually quite popular with Large BGE owners).

The one “advantage” BGE does have is that they have a much larger dealer network. That’s great if you are fortunate enough to actually have a good dealer in your area. A lot of dealers suck tho.

Because their are more BGE’s out there a lot of accessories are made for them that may not be available for other kamados. That is likely to change tho as some other brands become more popular. For instance, you can get KickAsh baskets for all sizes of Kamado Joes and one size of Vision brand kamados.

There are some newer brands in stores (Pit Boss for one) that are offering excellent prices but who knows how long that new company will be around to support and provide warranty parts. Yoou can’t go wrong by buying a BGE but some of the other brands shouldn’t be considered “off brands”.

I think a much better value is to buy a Kamado Joe at one of the Roadshows that are held at Costco stores. Great prices and KJ’s are easily equal in quality.

I wouldn't assume that. 1) allowing Hill. to be prosecuted means that he a. endorsed a criminal, b. hired a criminal, and c. had such little control over his cabinet that they broke the law under his nose. None of those options look good for his legacy, which he seems to care about a lot. 2) he certainly thinks a Democrat will be better for the nation than Trump, and an indictment would certainly make it more likely Trump wins.

So I don't think Obama will be unbiased, because both his pride and his care for America will lead him to protect her",1467331426

"civ","t5_2rk3b","&gt; Game mechanics aside, it's certainly more realistic.
&gt; Instant isn't really instant. You ""instantly"" build an improvement, click the turn button, months/years/decades pass, then the improvement begins to yield resources.
&gt; I've always thought it was silly that early in the game a mine took generations to begin yielding its resource.

Well, yes and no. Civ operates on a double time scale, by which *everything* takes place over the course of centuries in the early game, from improvements to buildings to waging wars. And aside from improvements, none of that stuff is instant. Lo! after 140 years of toil, the Egyptians built *a granary*.

That all's still in place. The years are sortof a reference point – you can say that in 840BC, the Russians and the Japanese went to war, and the Russians conquered Tokyo amidst great losses. That doesn't make sense as spanning the centuries of time that it would in Civ, but you can imagine the events taking place over a few years around the time of the game clock.

Anyway, it's silly talking realism in a game that's so heavily abstracted. I do wonder about this from a gameplay perspective, as three improvements is pretty big for an instant boost. For reference, in C5 a granary gives a city a onetime boost of 2-3 food typically. 3 improvements would be 3-6, depending on what we're improving. I guess we'll have to trust Firaxis to balance from there.",1467331427

Your claim is that only movies that make exactly $100,000,000 US dollars outside SE Asia provide any exposure to the language or languages they use?

I think you're exaggerating your case.

Trend**ing**? As in Twitter?

So you're claiming that while the proportion of box office and economic influence of English has peaked, the decline isn't a trend, because you refuse to accept that meaning if the word, and would rather reduce the argument to one of semantics?

What word do you suggest for ""trend""? ""Long term tendency of the first derivative with respect to time""?

&gt; When (not if) I start seeing Hindi language movies breaking box office records in the West (like Slumdog did with $377 worldwide and $141 US) then I'll know something is afoot.  Until then, it's mostly background noise.

For example, I fucking love the eyes in Nana. So you'd think maybe to look to the Animation Director, but then you'd also have to consider all the key animators for that show. You'd have to do a process of elimination with staff members profiles to trace those eyes across shows. You'll notice that Yuuki, Nobuteru is doing Character Design for [Orange](http://myanimelist.net/anime/32729/Orange/characters#staff) and the eyes in Orange are the same as Nana. So tada, a connection is made and I have my eye guy :).

In summary, identify specifically what you want to prioritize and then do a process of elimination with the staff members. If you have no specific priority then go with the studio.",1467331429

"DotA2","t5_2s580","Well, many of things that might be relevant have been said already.I recommend you to read this a bit, you might get an idea from that point: http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Role. You can also use this to get an idea on what heroes to pick coming from LoL: http://www.dotabuff.com/learn/lol

But in my opinion an interesting thing you might need to know is how ""safe"" the lanes are, because that influences how much you can get from them and hence what to pick for it. That's why in Dota people classifies role based on a numeric system of farm depenency ussually linked to a lane. 1-2 for safelane/middle (core/carry heroes), 3 for offlane, 4-5 for supports. 1 thing to be said, ""carry"" is a wider term in Dota that indicates farm dependency or potential scaling with items, mostly used for AA-heavy heroes who want aggressive items but also for other heroes that might like to stack more utility-oriented items (hence the ""semi"" thing). Now moving into lanes.

Middle is usually very hard to gank and the long lane tends to offer much more spatial safety than the short lane (offlane) so those 2 are effectively the 2 best spots to get farm. That's why in the numeration system, 1-2 are ussually carries and get played in that lanes. Regarding mid, meta can change a ton, but in most cases you'd like to put here a hero that scales well with levels and has decent kill potential and a good mid-early game because being solo you'll get levels very fast. You can also put your most traditional carries here, specially ranged ones like Sniper, OD, Medusa, Viper. Heroes with less item dependency than heavy autoattack carries might also be a good bet here, because it's easier to access the river from there, and there are runes that spawn and can be used to replenish bottle (item that gives reusable charges of small HP and mana). Heroes that might make more use of mana, like spell-heavy characters (QoP, Puck, Zeus) fit way better in mid than in other lanes. Because of the same reason, initiator friendly heroes like Sand King or Earth shaker can be put ocasionally mid, rushing their access to Blink dagger and giving them fast levels to empower their gank potential (this being known as utility mid). Any other hero with easy gank potential with a good ultimate timing (lvl 6) can also fit the mid lane well: In that sense, mid is way more flexible than any other lane, so that's why it is a ""semi-carry"" lane. The general idea that you should get is that mid is a mostly solo lane and quite safe, so you should get an advantage from it and there's an obvious game inertia from that point, so that hero should carry the game to some extent. Putting a hero which limited potental scaling by himself is a weaker option in most cases.

Safelane is basically straight forward, pick a farm-dependent hero that scales well with items (a ""hard"" carry) and secure its farm in the space advantage that the lanes give. That's ussually why you put also a support there to protect him. Like in LoL, insert here damage oriented heroes and protect them. Exemples of heroes: Drow, Anti-mage, Juggernaut, Slark, etc.

Offlane is shorter so in most cases you could be zoned as the creep waves collide in a part that is separated from your tower, that's why in pro games they ussually send a solo hero that doesn't need that much farm becasue it will be hard for him to get a big number of last hits, while soaking the exp might be easier. So here theoretically you'd put heroes with a good combat-oriented ulti or extra mechanics that give them more safety or range to farm it. The array of possibilities is wide. BUT at a lower level of gameplay, offlane is ussually played as a carry+support (like safelane). Simply, consider that the offlane will ussually give you less than your safelane, so that's why some  heroes with less farm dependency or additional farming/movement mechanics can be played as solo laners there and it's a pretty common strategy.

Supports are the other side of the ""carry"" thing. In most cases you don't need much items, ussually you can do perfectly fine with boots, some minor item and some heavy utility item like Force staff, Blink dagger, Glimmer Cape, and your role is more oriented toward initiation and teamfight control, also via CC, buffs, debuffs or extra burst in some cases (Quintaesential exemple of support: Lion). You are also the one mostly in charge of wards, dusts and smokes, and buying/upgrading courier courier, zoning the enemies during the laning phase to secure farm for your carries (until everyone gets past 6, rotations start and first line of towers start to fall). This heroes are played 4-5 because they should only soak a lane when the carries are not in the lane for some reason and your pressence is not required in other lane (Carry is dead, moving from base, or in a gank from a fast rotation)

4 is a more complex thing, since it might exist or might not. The number 4 is used ussually for ganking/roaming supports that might get some kills by themselves or have some ability to farm or jungle to milk it a bit, and can secure kills so moving from lane to lane  looking for ganks fits them (specially with smoke). An exemple of ganking support: Bounty hunter (invis), Crystal maiden, Riki (invis), Mirana. In some cases, you can put offlane heroes here.This ussually results in a greedier position than a safe support, and there are also other advanced options, but that's mostly pro's tryharding (""No-lane carry""). 

4 is also used for junglers. Jungling is not as common as in LoL, even if the last patch has made it quite easier with an item, and it's mostly an early game strategy, with a negative effect in the lane pressence. It is not always viable, and there's realistically like 10 heroes that can do it reliably. The benefits from the jungle are limited, since it's way harder to farm than a lane and it's not as beneficial, however the exp amount you can get from it is pretty big on the early game. Other people has suggested good guides.

5- Supports are ideally the most farm independent heroes and they have good damage nukes, CC and good kill securing mechanisms.  Lion, Bane, Witch Doctor, Dazzle and guys like that are representtives.

Use the attributes on the ""heroes"" page in-game and gamepedia to learn a bit around this. And watch some pro games. Dotabuff also gives some information if  you click on heroes.

"eulaw","t5_31c4t","The reason why common law people find this undemocratic is due to a fundamental difference between what is law in civil law and what is law in common law. Moreover, there is an important distinction between what function laws have within civil law and what functions they have in common law, and particularly those passed by Parliament (for us all laws are passed by a legislative body, for instance).


The issue is that within civil law we have codes that constitute law. Codes are then applied on a case-by-case basis by judges, but judges do not make any laws, they just say what it is. In civil law, the law is purely a legislative matter. Whereas in common law they have the judges that make the laws, and the bills that are passed within parliament in most cases are adjustments to case law, or clarifications/modifications from judgements from the common law. In other words, for us a single Parliamentarian cannot look to develop a code of law, that's what parties together and government's do. Modifications for our laws are narrow, and in some sense change the age of drinking in the Penal Code from 14 to 16. There's no point in one person initiating that, but you have a party that supports it, or the government. Then they propose it together, and thereby making the parliamentary system with multiple parties functionable. Common law, parliament supplements or directs the case-law and the judges, and not the other way around. One individual somewhat needs to be able to intitiate a law about a particular topic that he found while reading cases, and he thinks that the stare decsis and/or the judge's reasoning and/or verdict is not what it should be.

Their view of anti-democratic comes from the fact that they consider somehow that it would infringe the ability of a Parliament to make laws, without taking into fact that there's a fundamental difference between the two systems as what the laws are, how they are made, who makes them.

At least that's my opinion. I've heard this come from multiple common law backgrounded people.",1467331435

Search google for your car and workshop manual or service manual, then you will have how the manufacture tells their techs how to replace things. 

Now that will give you knowledge on how to work on your car, but what if you also want to hang out with car people. Go on Facebook and search for groups of car enthusiasts that are local to your area. You can also search for owners club of your car on fb too and you may find a local group of owners. Or if you want to be really bold, around 8-9 at night go drive around and find large parking lots whose business have already closed, if you drive around enough you will probably find a group of people hanging around their modified cars. Go park and introduce yourself. If they are dicks don't get discouraged but go find another group. Most car people are cool and will talk to you so don't worry.

&gt; MANILA Crushing Islamist militants in the Philippines will take precedence over territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the incoming defense minister said on Wednesday, and spending on military hardware would reflect that.

&gt; Lorenzana&amp;#039;s comments about his defense priorities will add to uncertainty about Duterte&amp;#039;s position on the Philippines&amp;#039; sometimes bitter dispute with China over sovereignty in the South China Sea, a key global trade route.

&gt; Lorenzana said the defense budget should be spent on winning security at home rather than buying fighter jets to protect its waters, as the Philippines would not be going to war with any country.

Now the most important thing and people don't get this.

You can not prevent every accident or penetration. You reduce the chance of getting into an accident to a very small percentage. You can reduce how often you get hacked. You can minimize the damage.

But to have a 100% success rate is impossible and unrealistic. 

Accidents will happen. The important question is if the accident rate is too high a percentage. When an accident does happen what can do done to minimize the damage.

Autopilot and Self Driving cars. The person behind the wheel can take control at any time. If they believe they don't have the pay attention, then that's human error.

Some people are saying Tesla is at fault for misleading people using the autopilot feature. I do not agree. Unless Tesla said that you can be in the back seat and take a nap, Tesla is not at fault.

There system and others will fail, the goal is to reduce that failure rate to a very small percentage and provide ways for people to minimize the damage. ",1467331446
"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;No, they shouldn't. That's my point. Certain land belongs to Israel. Arabs can live there, but that means they're living in Israel. Likewise, the West Bank belongs to Palestine

Why should the full West Bank entirely belong to Palestine, a state that has never existed and has no sovereign borders? Why should the 1967 borders, which were armistice lines that everyone (including Jordan and Palestinians) agreed should not be binding, now suddenly be binding?

&gt;Jewish people should be allowed to live there, but the land should still belong to Palestine. Israel shouldn't be able to take land, settle Jewish people there, and treat it like it belongs to Israel

It doesn't. It applies Israeli law to Israelis and Palestinian law to Palestinians. Israel doesn't ""take land"", the land is bought by Israelis. Israel doesn't settle people there, it allows people buying land to live on it.

You keep painting this as some government movement of people and annexation of land. It isn't. Israel has offered to withdraw from more than half of the territory settlements sit on for peace, and settlements only sit on less than 15% of the West Bank to begin with. And Israel offered to compensate for any land it kept, in accordance with what the entire world agrees should happen.

Palestinians rejected that deal.

&gt;But why is Israel *continuing* to build *new* settlements?

You mean why does Israel allow Israelis to buy land and live on it? Because there's no reason not to. Palestinians themselves when polled say no settlements won't lead to peace. So why should Israel restrict its people from buying land? I'm all for doing that if Palestinian leaders stop encouraging the murder of Israelis. No murder for no house building, I think that's more than a fair trade. Israel shouldn't restrict the rights of its people without getting another right in return: a guarantee that Palestinian leaders will stop encouraging the denial of Jews' right to life.

&gt;They move people there, then they say, ""What can we do? We can't just let the Palestinians have that land now, because they'd harm the Jewish population.""

False. Israel has offered to leave the land and evacuate that population pretty much everywhere that isn't already heavily populated, and most of those heavily populated areas (less than 8% of the West Bank) were areas that housed Jews before 1948 anyways that were displaced by Jordan and Palestinians. The communities were simply rebuilt.

Israel offered to compensate Palestinians for any land they kept. As settlements expanded, Israel has offered to withdraw from more territory. Though settlements are 2x or more as populated as they were in the 1990s, Israel offered 80% of the West Bank to Palestinians in the 1990s, Palestinians asked for land equal to 92%, then Israel offered that in 2000, and Palestinians rejected it, then Israel offered land equal to 99.5% (93.7% of which was West Bank land, not compensating swaps) and Palestinians rejected that in 2008.

Israel has offered more, it hasn't done what you said. You seem to think Israel moved in people and said it couldn't withdraw. Instead, as Israel allowed people to move in, it offered to withdraw from **more**, rather than less, and to such a degree that they offered more than Palestinian leaders themselves asked for. Then Palestinian leaders just asked for more. House-building is not the problem.",1467331446

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Korean movie story time? Korean movie story time!

So, Operation Chromite, more famously known as ""Battle of Incheon"" was a turning point in the Korean War. Think of it as Korea's Normandy.

[Referential Map](https://imgur.com/FYvcJec) (two cities have been circled in red)

By this time, the North Korean army had advanced so deep into South Korea, Busan (the number two city of South Korea, and the southern most city) was the last standing city for SK, and the war seemed almost over. Doug MacArthur decided that he would cut NK's controlled area from the waist, and decided to attack Incheon, which was on the west side of Korea (this is why it's a bit like Normandy). It was a pretty big military success, and South Korea's fight (with the US aid) had begun then.

As such, MacArthur was a pretty big figure in Korea (I remember reading his autobiography as a kid, and MacArthur was regarded on the same ranks as our traditional Korean heroes), and the Battle of Incheon symbolized a beacon of hope, a bold move.

All this probably means that the movie should be good, and Korea should be excited, right? The thing is that they already tried to make a movie about Operation Chromite way back in 1981, co-produced by Hollywood and Korea. The movie, [Incheon](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084132/), starred Lawrence Olivier and Toshiro Mifune. It was directed by Terrence Young (Dr. No, From Russia with Love). You may be thinking this would be one of those eastern-meets-western classic hidden gems like [Red Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sun), but no, this was a bad film. It was funded almost exclusively by Sun Myung Moon of the Unification Church, and there was a heavy involvement from the church. It failed so hard (it had a budget of $46 million and made about $5.2 million) that the subject matter (the Korean War) became a taboo in the movie industry, which is why you don't see that many movies made about the Korean War in Hollywood.

Another thing is that the war films are not that popular in Korea. You would think that the country divided in half would have more patriotic war movie followings. While the success of [Taegukgi](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0386064/) is notable, I would say that the Korean movie industry couldn't quite find the right tone to discuss about the wars. You have to remember that the country is still divided in half, with separated families. For SK, NK is the closest country, but also the furthest, because it is easier for Dennis Rodman to enter NK than actual Koreans.

Most of the Korean war movies tend to become quite mopey or just outright Independence Day-level patriotic roaring. This is why most of the Korean critics are rather uncertain of Korean war movies- they cannot objectively judge these films, as the subject matter is still riddled with anti-communism (we still have McCarthyism-esque red scare coming back every election season) and patriotism.

The trailer looks pretty good, and I hope the movie is good, but would just like to provide some insight into why the general populace has this reservation. I mean, I would not be too surprised to see it flop, is how reserved I am.

"Minneapolis","t5_2r3bl","I agree that police sometimes do those things. If I picked another group that did those exact things, it wouldn't be much of a metaphor. It is actually a pretty good metaphor in broad terms for the inability of people to do their job with no cooperation from the people they are supposed to be helping. 

I get that you think the cops are always the bad guys. But it just isn't true. Hey are the bad guys too often, but you are honestly greatly overstating how bad they are. They are working on solving this case as we speak. 

Plus- like I keep saying- police forces are made of individuals. Acting like they are all bad is just like a person who has had some bad experiences with a certain race and assumes all people of that race are the same. 

I've known people like that, and it is always hilarious to me when they finally let their guard down with someone of that race and within a few hours they are telling me 'you know- I really liked that guy- I guess some of them are good people.'

And my response is always: 'no shit. Good thing you wasted so many years refusing to associate with anyone who looked like them.'

What would you say to the (in my opinion) 'good cops' I talked to who were both frustrated with the few bad cops giving them a bad reputation and frustrated with the neighborhoods where they try to help and nobody will let them? How can the good ones break the cycle when the community literally won't talk to them? Do you honestly think *all* police are racist thugs?

I would change that, it's misleading.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","You're probably familiar with a lot of what was popular at the time.

The Vietnam War was in full swing, but with a draw down on the horizon.

Nixon was campaigning, and then winning the general election.

Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin both died in 1970 of drug and alcohol related ODs. Jim Morrison would follow them in 1971, though his cause of death is officially listed as ""heart failure"".

Woodstock happened in '69, and was HUGE for the popular consciousness of anyone under the age of 30 and plenty of people older than 30, too.

Things were ""happenin'"" they were ""cool"" ""hot"" and ""groovy"" still. You had to worry about ""The Man"" catching you with your stash, your H, your Mary J.

Cocaine was coming up in use, too. Angel Dust, PCP, uppers and downers, Bennies (a form of amphetamine, actual name: Benzedrine). The Rolling Stones sang about ""Mother's Little Helper"" a yellow pill, which was likely a barbituate.

Tons of popular music from the era will clue you into slang terms, too.

Think about movies like Dirty Harry (1971) and the growing fascination with handguns that it promoted. Everybody was quoting the ""Do you feel lucky, punk?"" line.

""That 70s Show"" and the movie ""Dazed and Confused"" may give you some helpful ideas about style and fashion, possibly some of the language and phrasing they would have used. But I wouldn't mimic anything in those without a lot of double checking for accuracy.

Books that would have been popular is a little trickier - people were still reading Kerouac's ""On the Road"" as well as Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"".

English teachers would also assign some of the standards for middle school and high school classes to read. That would be ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Huckleberry Finn,"" and ""Tom Sawyer"". Though whether or not people read the books or just bough the Clif Notes is another thing to consider ;-)

The musical ""Hair"" was produced in the later years of the 1960s, and it, like Woodstock, had a big impact on youth culture of the early 70s. It was filmed in 1979, so too late for you to include that way. But it was on Broadway in 1968 and showed worldwide until it was revived there in 1977.

You'd have TV shows like Leave it Beaver still showing as reruns. Same with the Andy Griffith Show. Loads of other shows were big then:

You've come a long way: from someone who was surrounded in a bubble of conservative faith and ill-fitting cultural norms, to a woman bold enough to pop that bubble and critically examine herself and the world around her.  This is a big journey, and not everyone is willing or able to take a similar journey.  You should be proud of yourself.

All of us reading these posts wanted to pop the bubble your mother lives in so she could be a real family member for you.  She has spent 57 years in her bubble.  If your heartfelt words cannot convince her to leave it, then the decision will have to come from within.  You've put yourself out on a frightening emotional limb trying to reach her, and she was too paralyzed to move toward you.  

I'm glad you are not going to stay on that limb.  You need to live your life without the incessant heartache of an asymmetrical relationship.  Take comfort in the fact that you opened an emotional dialogue and gave your mother a chance to make the right decision, and take joy in the positive relationships you do have.

All the best.

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","8 can still leav out two conference champions. 10 is perfect with every conference champion getting in. At that point it's essentially an 8 team playoff but the last two spots have a play in game.

EDIT: Alright, let me explain myself more here just to get the point across. Right now college football is broken. The split between G5 and P5 is something that's almost never addressed in discussions about postseason and playoff play and that's a problem. G5 conferences are almost never in the conversation. As it stands, we've created a system that artificially separates teams based on conference, even though there's no designation by the NCAA that it's different. That's, again, a problem. All teams competing at the same level should have an equal shot at the title at the beginning of the season, right? Then why have we devised a system where that thought is not only false, but *laughable*? The idea that a team like Wyoming, Georgia State, or whoever could make the playoffs is a joke. Even if they go undefeated. Over half of the teams in college football are eliminated before the season starts, and that's not a healthy system. Now this can be addressed in a couple of ways. The way we have now is entirely based off of polls and opinions and a committee, which works alright, but still leaves these teams high and dry. It leaves them without a spot. And more importantly, a team can go undefeated and not get a shot in this system. Any system that allows this is broken.

The way I see it, the best solution for all of this would be to officially separate G5 and P5, allow G5 teams to compete for their own, separate title, and play their own playoffs. This is something that won't fly in the NCAA and generally wouldn't work well, in big part because it'd cause problems with the bowl system. That would be the best way. But other than that, we still have to treat every single team at the same level equally, G5 and P5 alike. This is a system that won't be fixed until each and every team has an objective path to the playoffs, meaning that the participants are determined by wins and losses, not by polls or committees. The way I see it, the best way to do this is by admitting conference champions. Which, again, leads me to the prospect of a 10 team playoff. You could also go 16 team with 6 at large, but I'm typically still of the mindset that you need to win your conference to be considered the best team, so no at large. It also gives the top 6 teams a reward with a bye. 

Tl;dr: The playoff system is broken until we have objective access for any team, and that won't happen unless we allow conference champions - every conference champion",1467331458

Edit: lol downvotes. When you really can't apply stats like that, lemme explain. Let's say there's a limbo competition (and in this ideal world people don't bend). You get a certain amount of money according to how short you are. Now the national average for height may be 5 ft 8 or whatever it is and because it should follow a normal distinction there's a point where the chance is 60-40 I. E. It may show that at 5ft 7, where 60 percent of the population is under the height. The thing is those stats don't apply to you. If you're 7 ft. You're not going to play the numbers game and say I'll try walk under a 5ft 9 pole, you're going to say make that pole 7 ft.


Stats break down at the individual. You can't apply all stats universally. There's every chance that Poland are actually better taking penalties second and are playing to their strength by doing so. 


Like most here dont have an understanding of how to apply stats. For example in this thread people have been saying that the stat makes sense because of the increased pressure going second but can't you see that that's quite literally confirmation bias. You have a stat and you're thinking of a reason the stat works. It'd be just as reasonable to say that going first reduces the pressure because you can still have the hope the second team doesn't finish. You're looking for evidence to support the stat instead of being guided by the evidence, that's confirmation bias.


All the stat says is that **most** teams are more likely to win  if they take a penalty second. It's not saying all teams should take penalties second, it's not saying shit about pressure. It actually probably shouldn't even used as a predictor without knowing the degree of variance.


I mean for fuck sakes there's a stat that shows you're like twice as likely to score a penalty if you go to your strong side. You know what happens if your whole team goes to their strong side? The keeper catches on. Stats are always useless unless their context can be understood. And for the example used the context for shooting to your strong side only works if the keeper doesn't know you're going to do that.",1467331460

There are jewels, I met quite a few people that actually have a brain, but majority of the community in Eastern Europe servers are just stupid kids that parent's don't care about at all. They have no brain, no respect, and their intelligence levels makes me start to theorize about Planet of the Apes and it's possibility.


Being politically correct and letting idiots do whatever they want will make EVERY SINGLE GAME EVER bad. Overwatch is simplified enough for these dumasses, thus VERY generous hitboxes for projectile weapons and even hitscan weapons. Otherwise game would be too hard for these inferior beings. Every single year, each game get's simplified. Because human race is actually getting more and more stupid.

I am not willing to let idiots with their boots step on my head and my world. Accepting such behaviour affects everyone, that's why everything get's more and more simplified, and people are getting more and more stupid.

If you're bad at the game and can admit it, I really like you, no hard feelings, you're awesome. If you suck and use ""internet vocabulary"" like ""cringe"" or ""git gud"" etc. I prefer you were gassed or just removed along with your family tree to purifiy Homo Sapiens Sapien's gene pool a bit more.

I won't be swayed by the fear mongering. I've had enough of the ""lesser of two evils"" shiite. There's already too much evil tolerated in this country.   

If I can't vote for Bernie, then I'll go:   
Green Party.    
Jill Stein.

According to my researches trolls like eating fish the most and seem to be heavily attracted by its smell and can't help but go for it. There is a good chance if you encounter a fishy statement and wonder if its author might be a troll or not, you just lay down fish and hope the suspected troll will take it and leave *forever*. That's a totally new approach towards dealing with trolls since you *feed* them to identify them and hopefully please them enough to take them and never come back. ",1467331469

Sometimes it involves a great deal of sacrifice (women are typically more interested in sex when we're fertile, which sucks if you need to not get pregnant that cycle. ::shakes fist at evolutionary biology::), but it's been a huge blessing to me and to my marriage.

I've been married for eight years. I've gotten pregnant four times (one miscarriage, three live births). Each of my pregnancies has happened when we consciously decided to have sex when I was fertile (two ""let's try to get pregnant this month!"" and two ""hey, let's take a chance and see what happens"").  I  often do not have regular, easily predictable cycles. Billings method NFP helped my doctor diagnose me with PCOS.

It's used that way both by foreigners and Dutchmen alike, including our national government, the official internet portal for all visa and immigration matters is www.welcometoholland.nl, for example.

In Dutch the use of Holland is a lot more complicated and sometimes offensive, but that depends on which variant of Dutch you're speaking, who's using it, to whom and in what context. Its nuances are so complex I'd immediately forgive any non-native speaker for using it inappropriately, even though I belong to one of the groups that's most commonly offended by this.

There are some Dutchmen that act as if the Dutch subtexts also apply in English, just like there are some Spanish speakers that consider the word 'America' offensive because it refers to the entirety of North and South America in Spanish. I personally consider those people to be wrong, they don't seem to realize that words can have different nuances and subtexts in different languages.

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","As they get older- into say teenage years, I would suggest changing the pay scale- renegotiating their ""contract"" in a way.

Let them know that things like keeping their room clean are now considered regular duties that no longer provide payment. This way they don't expect a reward every single time they do something simple.

Some kids internalize the cleanliness and good behavior- which is the best outcome. Other kid's don't and then expect a reward. If they don't get the reward then they literally could give two shits about keeping their dorm/apartment/personal self clean and organized. That's the worst possible outcome, but I've seen it happen. Then in the real world or at work, maybe they are asked to be a good team member and pull a little extra weight once in a while. They think it's unfair that they don't get rewarded for it, but it's just that reality sometimes sucks and we don't always get something for doing good things. Humanity should want to do good things just to do good things, you know? 

I do concede that in the work world you have to strike a careful balance of ""being a good team member"" and asking your employer for adequate compensation for tasks that go above and beyond what your contract stipulates- you don't want your kid getting walked all over at the office. 

But it sounds like you're doing an awesome job as a parent and I really hope to be as good as you one day. I just teach a bunch of 4-10 year olds right now, and I've seen how sometimes the reward system can get corrupted.

There are three classes social welfare, A B and C. A is  for blacks, the highest payment. B is for coloureds, C is for whites. And even trying to qaulify for C as a white its difficult. There are initiatives in place to encourage hiring of blacks over whites, regardless of qualifications. And white people will find less help with regards to bursaries, regardless of income. 

Let's not go into how South African white are on the genocide watch list for potential genocide classification. It's a bit personal, when my grandparents were butchered. I dont like to play that card, but you're talking about systematic oppression. The guys were caught and let off. 

My ""bubble"" is that of being lucky enough to get out of that shit hole. And being proud of doing so. Not every white person has that opportunity. I'm in Ireland now. There is no favoured race here. But I'm damn proud to be a white South African. Especially one that has dated black girls in a country where that is social suicide, and regardless of family tragedy caused by racial difference. So yeah, being white is a big deal to me. Being white in South Africa in any area that isn't Pretoria, Port Elizabeth or Cape Town and not letting it cloud your views, or bring you down is something to be very proud of. 

And right now, there are riots in Pretoria because a Zulu lady was made mayor. And white businesses are a pretty big target, as was my aunt's place of work, set on fire with her in it. But she's fine, and she's locked up in her house in fear. But staying strong as a targeted minority like that doesn't deserve pride, right?

The problem is partly the fault of immigration reformers in the past. If they had issued amnesty, and then really stepped up efforts on the border and deporting people who overstay their visas (I believe those make up half of the illegal immigrants here), then we wouldn't have this problem.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Allow me to take a small swing at explaining this issue, specifically regarding the SCOTUS seats.

1) I, and many other Independent, anti-Hillary, anti-Trump voters, simply don't believe that Hillary will nominate a Justice that will actually do ANYTHING progressive or liberal, at all.

Nothing Clinton has actually DONE (not said in a speech, not sent out in a flyer, but actually done) indicates that she is against Citizen's United, or the Death Penalty, or is in any way pro Middle Class, or for actual progressive social agendas.   (It was only a few years ago that she finally, ""changed her mind"" about Gay Marriage.  And don't even get started on her stances on civil rights, minority rights, or women's rights.  Anyone that takes money from Saudi Arabia is simply not a social progressive.)

2) We have a lawfully, popularly elected Democrat as President of the United States RIGHT NOW.  Barack Obama, you may have heard of him?   
If the currently sitting President cannot get his nominee to be vetted, interviewed, considered, or even acknowledged, why would I believe for a moment that the most hated Democratic (presumptive) nominee, who is currently under FBI investigation, and embroiled in civil suit after civil suit, would be able to get anything accomplished on that front?

If anything, Clinton would experience even more roadblocks, but in her case they would be far more justifiable than they are in President Obama's circumstances.

The SCOTUS issue is not the deal maker.

For me, nothing short of the completion of the FBI investigation, the full disclosure of all of Clinton's State Department emails, and the release of her speech transcripts to corporate America, could possibly earn my vote.

who owns the *fruits of the worker's labor?* is it the workers? NOPE, SEE ABOVE

That was not the size I was referring to when I said small. I would consider their breasts average to average/large.

Not really. Gb10 if you don't have anything else. I sometimes use her and Rina to auto against full water/wind GWD because my obession over her.

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","I have PCOS, and in case you didn't already know it can lower your BMR by up to as much as 700 kcal from what it should be for your height, weight, build, and age. You might be thinking that you're burning more calories than you actually are because of this. A good way I've found to lose weight with PCOS is through ketosis, except I hate Keto so I don't do that. Instead I do alternate day fasting, a type of intermittent fasting, and occasionally supplement that with 5 day water fasts. Fasting has shown to be really good for insulin resistance and weight control. 

I'm not trying to push my diet on to you, I just know how it feels to struggle with PCOS and feel like weight loss is impossible. Fasting has helped me lose ten pounds in the past three weeks, and it honestly makes me feel better. Before I started fasting I was limiting myself to 1200 calories a day. According to every calculator I've used my TDEE is supposed to be 1600, which it obviously isn't because even at 1200 I was STILL gaining weight. And I wasn't overeating, I was tracking and weighing everything.

Just some food for thought. Hormone treatments don't work for everyone, and just eating clean or lowering your intake a bit doesn't work for a lot of women with PCOS. I know it's frustrating, but it never hurts to try.",1467331483

"trucksim","t5_2sbs2","Yes, it's possible. I'll assume you're on Windows (I'm not sure if ETS2 runs on Linux, sorry), follow these steps to create a Symbolic Link:  

* Create a backup of the files you want to move (mods, savefiles). Save them anywhere. DON'T PROCEED BEFORE MAKING A BACKUP :)
* Create a folder on your secondary disk where you will move the MOD files. Lets say D:\ETS2\mod (can use any name);
* Run Windows command prompt as administrator;
* Run the following:  
    **mklink /D C:\Users\yourUser\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\temp D:\ETS2\mod**  
  
This will create a folder named '**temp**' inside your regular ETS2 folder that points to **D:\ETS2\mod**;  

* Copy your mods from the regular ETS2 folder to **D:\ETS2\mod**;  
* Test if the Symbolic Link is working by accessing C:\Users\yourUser\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\**temp**. It should show the mod files you just copied in the previous step;  
* Rename or delete (you have a backup from step 1, right?) your original MOD folder (C:\Users\yourUser\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\mod);
* Rename the **temp** folder as **mod**.  (\Euro Truck Simulator 2\temp to \Euro Truck Simulator 2\mod).
.

Now your mod folder inside C:\Users\yourUser\Documents\Euro Truck Simulator 2\mod should point to D:\ETS2\mod where the actual mod files are.

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","It probably isn't that they are just bad. They might be doing a completely average job playing their chosen hero individually. The problem mostly lies in teamwork and coordination, something that takes a certain awareness in a solo queue scenario.  
  
Genji might have killed a teleporter, made a couple people chase him around the map, and picked off their Mercy. Genji is doing his job. Unfortunately the team didn't take awareness of this fact and they stayed shooting through the chokepoint, scared to push in. Now the Mercy has respawned and teleporter is almost ready once more.  
  
Now you could say this lack of awareness is that they are just bad, but there are so many scenarios like this that when you stack them all together is hard to mentally grasp while actively shooting and dodging bullets. This is where voice communication and callouts come into play.

"neurophilosophy","t5_2rf6a","I will say, working in the neuroscience field, there are (too) few people discussing these things, and of the ones that are (again, only in my experience), many more than you would think have a tacit or negative view of determinism. 

Further, i think we are still talking about apples and oranges. I mean to say that one trusts their rationality (and rightly so) because it is their own. No, if we were just looking at different peoples brains, there is no such thing as a ""more rational configuration of neurons"": there can't be, because neurons follow the laws of physics, and those are by definition rational (totally a paraphrase of a Hofstadter quote).

There is no ""right"" answer, to any real question, from any reference frame. There are just scales of 'works better' and 'doesn't work better'. You can never know you're *right* - in a metaphysical sense of the word - and still do empirical work. That's why neuroscience has functionally shifted to a more deterministic (or at least concomitant) view of human action: our theories work much better describing differences in people's behavior in terms of physical/biological condition rather than psycho, logo, or spiritual configuration. In that sense we are doing induction on an inductive process, which while infinite, doesn't seem regressive to me :)",1467331488

"politics","t5_2cneq","I think I would leave the idea of social conservatism and what I would like to see by using the example of Hillsdale College in Michigan. 

There are lots of Christian based conservative colleges but there are also lots of non-christian based who as a matter of principle do not accept federal aid. I am not sure about the Christian ones however. Its not explicitly mentioned with them so I assume some are federally funded. 

Me personally I am not religious, I have a degree in Behavioral Science and statistically I shouldn't exist being conservative in nature. But I have an understanding of religion in society and its not about god this and that, strict scripture and damn all those that don't agree, its more geared towards character building. 

And then when you start to look at how their curriculum's roll out you see a lot of liberal studying of the arts and philosophy, socialism infused with American Heritage, US Constitution and etc.

One of my favorites is Christendom College in Royal Virginia..

The college aims to teach students to “distinguish truth from error or distortion, and then to communicate truth accurately, effectively, and convincingly to others.”

Christendom’s core curriculum includes the study of Catholic doctrine, philosophy, mathematics, and science. Students spend a junior-year semester in Rome.

They don't come out bible thumpers, they come out as well rounded intellectuals with view points from religion and social structure to conservative values. And right there I think a liberal campus could benefit by including religion as a requirement to learn about. 70% of the population identifies as Christian.

Now that may seem odd coming from a person who likes to identify as Atheist, but I think we can take the best parts of religion to be better people. At the very least liberals should know how a person of faith thinks, rather than assuming. I could also make a strong argument that if we let religion and private institutions do the heavy lifting on social issues rather than the government we could see dramatic improvements. I wrote a 15 page paper arguing on how this could potentially work. It kind of works its way into the belief that it takes a village to raise a child. Because society now is about not knowing your neighbor or the people in your community. That is why people like to raise kids in small towns, everyone knows you, its hard to be a little shit and get away with it, lol. 

But we all know why religion began to wane. When you abuse that many innocent people and cover it up, not many people are going to look to you for guidance. And for me its like damn, how many wars have been fight in the name of religion? Its a freaking blood bath of history. But there is still a core amount of good that you can take and use.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First of I do not agree with the girl or her beliefs... 
But am I the only one who thinks that the guy is just as bad?

I mean is a loaded question ""do you condemn Hamas?"" in some contexts (the ones he is using it). Because the way he implies it it looks like if she (or anyone) were to say yes it would follow up with ""therefore they need to be destroyed/eradicated/fought/denied existence"" And that is why it is not a simple yes/no question. 

Yes I condemn the terrorist actions of hamas, but can we also ask ourselves why they exist? why they do it? Shouldn't we also look at the source of this so apparent collective madness? And no sorry it is not religion, but more in the context of feelings of anger, powerless, desperation, danger,..  that drive people to take any action that they think it might help and therefor also becoming preys of war/power mongers that use religion as one of their many tools to control the people... So yes in the end Israel is the one who is almost directly responsible for the horrible state that the Palestine is in and it is their own damn fault for creating conditions that make terrorism prosper... also many of their actions against Palestine could almost be perceived as attempts at genocide (although a bit more tactful, without the gas chambers but for example by cutting water supply....). The worst of it all is that whenever someone tries to argue against Isreal they will go ""oh you do not like Isreal, you must be a nazi""... for fucks sake.... being a victim of a genocide does not give you an infinite out of jail card.  So yes I condemn terrorist actions but I also condemn Isreal because instead of trying to solve the problem they are using it for their own political agendas and just making it worse... Funny enough the exact same applies to US(and the rest of our  western world) and ISIS. The problem will not be solved with bombs, the problem was made with bombs...... 

But who needs reason when you can just blame everything on a religion: ""we just have to get rid of that religion and the problem will go away"" (spoiler alert: no it will not)

And yes I am a strong atheist and no I do not think religion is a positive thing but I love reason more than hate religion....

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I was accounting for longships. Longships are much better for that kind of sea battle, and are much faster than dany's cogs.

also, I doubt that Dany's fleet is larger by much, if any.

The absolutely enormous Redwyne fleet? 200 warships at their prime, and (if they wanted to stop trade for a while and fill merchant hulls with seasick soldiers) 500 merchant and whaling ships.

Dorne is not known for having any sort of a significant navy - in fact, it is quite the opposite (when having 100 ships is considered to be a very big navy, that means I'd put them at Maaaaybe 50), and Yara brought the 100 main ships of the Iron Fleet (which is distinct from the Greyjoy fleet, and the fleets of the ironborn lords). That means, Volantis, Astapor, and Yunkai would have to have 750 ships put together to bring her up to the 1000. In the books, Volantis has 300 something ships. If we assume that the other Slaver's Bay cities had fleets similar to their sister city of Mereen's 90-something ship fleet that the Harpy burned, then they are close... Until we subtract the ships that Dany destroyed when breaking the siege. 

Also, the one firepower advantage that Dany has is her dragons - War cogs themselves are basically floating lumps that are employed because they can carry a lot of men, and the early medieval era didn't really have much better when it came to transport. They are equipped with a Forecastle and Aftcastle, where the soldiers on the ship are supposed to use their shortbows and crossbows to fend off boarders, then to give the occupants some cover if the attackers get past that. Unfortunately, Dany's aren't filled with marine combat experts... Ship warfare in the historical period *and* according to GRRM's descriptions is based on ramming the enemy ship and either disabling/sinking them using a usually metal capped and quite thick prow, or boarding the enemy and fighting Ironborn style.

Unfortunately, the Ironborn are basically unmatched at sea skirmishes of that sort (Not sieges or Blackwater-styled battles, of course) with their extremely-maneuverable ships and lifetimes of training. Stannis is the only dude who has ever really beaten them in this sort of thing... Ever, AFAWK.

Also, if a storm is going on, then Dragons are not going to give very good recon. A fairly strong but also extremely common ocean squall can bring waves up to 10 feet high from placid seas in a few minutes, and rain can quite easily reduce visability by up to 75%. If the dragons are scouting in that, they are knocking face-first into masts as they go.

However, if the book is followed and not what we saw of some of the Volantine fleet, they do have a lot of Dromonds, which are basically the Ironborn't ship, which are better armored and have better speed bursts, but are much more unwieldly to steer. Net, they would be an advantage.

Now, Braavos could give a 1000 ship Ironborn navy a good smackdown, if they were fighting to win and not doing the smart pirate thing.",1467331494

Overall, a game with cute monsters like this? Pfft, I gave it a try. I don't mind the grinding, I think they have done a good job of getting me hooked. I love the concept of collecting cute monsters but also utilizing them to complete content. I guess that's why I'm very much a PvE player rather than a PvP person. 

I actually quit for a while and let my friend play on my account for 3-4 months. After that time, she messaged me that she had gotten a Light King Angelmon on my account from wish, which completed my previous King Angelmon collection, and I wanted to see it (I'm completely F2P so the L/D King Angelmon was a big deal). There was a Mystical Scroll in the shop so I bought it. You know, sticking your hand in the cookie jar. Then out popped Anavel. I was so happy but at the same time I was like, ""Aw damnit, now I have to play. I just pulled the monster I joined the game for and gabbed about for the whole time I played this game.""

My endo wanted me to visit the psych I had an appointment with before prescribing. Only took one psych appointment to get a recommendation for HRT (actually 2, the first appointment was with a therapist who said they couldn't help).

Was relatively painless after I found people willing to help. Still not on finasteride, since my endo wants me to see a dermatologist, but I've been having difficulties getting an appointment with one (first one said they don't do hair loss, second is having issues with paperwork). But I'm on my estrogen+spiro, so I'm happy. Endo was wondering whether I should go on progesterone, but from what I'm seeing here, that should be added after about a year, so it's a no-go for now.

&gt; My generation (late baby-boom generation) turned socialism into a dirty word, even though most have no problem with social security and Medicare -- socialist programs. If there's a generation that doesn't understand socialism, it's mine.

&gt; Socialism is not a switch. You don't flip a switch from ""socialism"" to ""capitalism,"" or vice-versa. Behaving like a capitalist, in your everyday business dealings, is natural. But what is needed is intelligent REGULATION. Capitalism has no system of regulation, in and of itself.

&gt; Compare capitalism to managing a piece of land. If you start with a bare field, productivity is low. It gradually builds as pioneer species of plants start to take root. Production increases, creating more plant biomass, and feeding more animals. But eventually, a climax community is reached, which is often LESS productive than earlier stages of growth. Resources are hogged by the largest trees, shading out anything trying to take root below it.

&gt; WE NEED REGULATION to keep our natural capitalist behavior from reaching that final stage, where productivity is low, and fewer are supported. When that regulation is introduced, knee-jerk claims of socialism spurt from the mouths of the brainwashed.

"spacex","t5_2srow","&gt; The future of the plan is that there are enough people on Earth that want to go to Mars that would pay their own way.

I think there is certainly a small group of people who just want to get off of the Earth and live somewhere else.  Unfortunately I don't think there is enough among the hardcore science fiction fans to make that into a reality and any effort among those just interesting in going to another place is ultimately going to result in a failure of that colony.  I could name several settlements in the USA that became utter failures from similar misguided notions of wealth that never really panned out, and Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts nearly joined that list except for the fact that the colonists were successful in transforming the colony from the idealistic notions into something much more pragmatic.

Life on Mars is going to be insanely difficult, and at the same time there will need to be some sort of economic draw to really make the colony there successful.  Hand waving and presuming that ""if we built it, they will come"" is not sufficient to make it happen.

The ""killer app"" or the vital strategic resource needed is something that can definitely make a difference here, which is why this issue is being brought up.  America worked out because it had ample timber (something the British Isles were definitely lacking in the 1600's and 1700's), tobacco, and eventually cotton that could be used to financially sustain the colonies.  Other frontier settlements in America even further into the woods relied upon Moonshine and other alcoholic products to pay for the items they couldn't make for themselves.  If you want to look at a real extreme, the Utah pioneers (Mormons) who traveled thousands of miles and often directly from the British Isles in the 19th Century struggled in poverty for years until they finally hit a cash crop of sugar beets (later potatoes in south-eastern Idaho) that pulled the region out of the financial doldrums.

I could go on, but I'm saying that simply shipping people to Mars is not going to be enough, and there will need to be something in the medium to long term time frame that makes going to Mars economically useful to people on the Earth in order for Mars to genuinely grow and become the self-sustaining colony that doesn't need constant philanthropy simply for people to live there.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","I think I understand what you mean now, but I would like to expand upon a few of the things brought up if you don't mind. This is going to be divorced from the main concept so don't think that I'm reference back to our earlier discussion.

&gt; I personally like the idea of either elected worker reps forming local worker councils which meet up and discuss production with councils from other areas to determine the direction and scope of production

So you vote for someone to decide what *you* want? When our tastes change all the time because of our experiences we don't even know what we want from one day to the next, how would it be possible for this elected representative to keep up?

This is getting a real command economy, ""you'll like this because we tell you to"" vibe from it. Your economy should always be focused on the pull rather than the push theory of mass production.

&gt;maybe community members fill out surveys distributed online and get stored in a cloud like database or something like that so the worker councils are aware of what their community needs. 

This could be a solution to that issue and I mean this is great and all but this would require users to be constantly and overtly making their demands known. People don't tend to do that because most of our consumption desires aren't entirely conscious. 

Also we'd need Google level algorithms to parse that amount of data into a usable format. Not saying its not possible but it would be challenging and would still require a ""trail and error"" method to some degree.

&gt;who then report back to the factories, farms/fields, etc to let them know the production needs

First, how much time and effort is going to be devoted to coordinating activities in this society? Also this still largely suffers from the command economy problem of someone having to make a decision on what you want that isn't you. That is very undesirable from a consumer point of view. 

Secondly, what if the desires of the consumers are not the same as the desires of the producers? If people want more eggplants but eggplant farmers feel that their labor would be better suited making alfalfa will this committee force the farmers to make eggplants? Or will the committee tell the consumers that they can't have eggplants? If you force the farmers to make eggplants how can you say that you've empowered them to take on the means of production? If you tell the consumers they can't have eggplants, how can you say that we live in a post-scarcity economy?

I don't mean to be too critical because I do honestly want answers to these challenges for a communist economy that operates in the real world not some theoretical world.",1467331501

"FIFA","t5_2qxh7","Sigh. Ok. Yes, any non Day 1 card will never get a stat boost from chemistry. **That is actually detrimental**. But they will also never lose stats if they are in low chemistry. **That's benefical.**

Say I play my TOTS Insigne at CAM. He'll be at 0 to 3 chem if I'm not mistaken. If he was affected by chemistry, he'll be losing stats. Since he's glitched, he doesn't, and his stats remain unchanged. I view that as an overall benefit, since now I can play any winger in the CAM position with no chemistry penalty.

I can play 11 players from 11 different leagues and 11 different nations, and as long as they're non Day 1, they'll all have base chem. If you do that with Day 1 cards, they'll get the chemistry penalty and massively underperform.

The stamina issue might be minor in perspective. But I think that being allowed to play with the same 11 players without ever needing a fitness card is pretty nice. I no longer need a fitness squad and can focus my income on improving my main squad.

&gt; There is also no way of knowing that it isn't deliberate, which is irrelevant anyway

1) There's no way to know, ok. But it sure wouldn't make sense for EA to deliberately keep this glitch around, because, using your argument, the more expensive players are being ""handicapped"". And they surely WANT you to get the more expensive players.

2) It very much is relevant because the entire point of ""handicapping"" is that EA purposefully handicaps the higher rated squads to give the lower rated team an advantage.


**tl;dr:** 90 rated Neymar is worse than 88 Neymar on 10 chem, as 88 Neymar will get a boost large enough to outperform 90 Neymar. That said, I'd still pick 96 or 97 Neymar over the 88, even if he doesn't get the chem boost, because he'll still outperform his Day 1 card, and I can play him wherever I want with no penalties on his performance.",1467331503

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","This is all very wrong. Its wrong because you start from wrong principles. You believe in 'evolution' and thus you think that the changes you see are natural or good. I call this the 'naturalistic fallacy', where you assume that because you see something, it must have arisen from natural forces. This is my coinage of the term and it is different from the 'naturalistic fallacy' that is shown in wikipedia. Anyway, the reason for the falling birth rates is not what you say either. For example, in Africa, there are countries like Nigeria and Ghana with modern styles of living. They have cities, running water, electricity, the internet etc. Africa does not look like what you think it does, but that's another post. The point is that it is only white, western countries that are seeing this decline in fertility. 'Technology' will not save you. Technology is not even that great. You have become obsessed with the idea because you lack spirituality.

If you had spirituality you would see that YOU, and your plant/animal friends, are the greatest form of technology extant. And that any 'technology' that you develop to 'replace' the functions you serve will be vastly inferior by comparison. You have these wide-eyed hopes for 'the future' while you live in shit today. The reason for this is because you are not able to objectively observe your conditions. If you were, you would quickly realize that the lack of technology is not your problem. The idea that 'AI' could or would replace man is fallacious. The idea that 'the labor market' just 'is' and should remain so is fallacious. You have all these assumptions that do not follow, but you believe them because you assume they should.

This is the naturalistic fallacy. The idea of 'progress' is oxymoronic when people lived much better lives in the past than they do today. Much more freedom, great sex, true love, true purpose, community, emotional stability, freedom from loneliness etc. Today you live in dark, grey 'cities' that are a collection of millions of strangers competing with you for everything from food to clean air and water. You daily ingests mind-numbing poisons like fluoride and chlorine in your water that were not present in the past. You are forced to spend 1/3 of your weekdays slaving so someone else can bang hotties on a boat in Dubai, while you are, IF YOU'RE LUCKY, given 2 weeks off from the drudgery a year. And you think you're free. And you think things are great. You think you live in paradise but you are like the automatons on 'The Island'. They have a beautiful view of an island that doesn't exist and to which they will never get to go. While they are actually killed and ground up for their organs.

That is the life you lead, and that is where your precious 'technology' is taking you. More and more chains and bars to contain your spirit and soul, to remove freedom by limiting your vision thus limiting your choices. More mind-numbing drugs and soul destroying empty sexuality. You do know that promiscuity is used to 'fracture' the soul right? When you have sex with someone, you open up a piece of yourself to them and you give it. The same for them. It happens on a subtle, energy level that cannot be seen but can be felt, if you have spirituality. Well, this piece is what 'love' is. The more you give the stronger it gets until you've formed a union with this person. Still with me? So what happens when you have wanton sex with any/everyone without 'commitment' to that person (I'm not talking about marriage, or financials, or even monogamy; only the act of being with someone and repeatedly giving a piece of yourself to them)? What happens is your mind and soul become fractured because you give yourself to so many people without building with them that you cannot think straight.

Its like facebook. No one really has 600 friends, the human mind can't handle so many connections. But people who TRY to have so many friends end up with a much more diluted and less rich experience than those who limit their attention to those who they can truly call friend. It is the same thing with sexuality. By fracturing the mind/soul TPTB prevent you from forming long-lasting connections that you would be willing to defend and improve. This further makes you a slave, malleable putty in their hands.

If you're wondering if local customs will jack your gear, they won't. I don't think they care tbh. As the other posters already noted, just check with your local aviation authority for rules in US airports.

I believe the standard 100ml carryon liquid limit applies, as well as the 18650s in a plastic case in your carryon. To be careful, just follow these rules in any airport. 

What you need to be careful about is when you head back to Murica. I'm sure you've heard the horror stories about loose bullets being planted in luggages. With the new administration in place this shouldn't be a problem. But be vigilant just in case.

We should all STFU and put cargo racks in our bounty hunting ships... because it's an open game and we should let people play how they want?

Delays of 10+ seconds every time I click an UI item are ""understandable"" because now there are a few pre-rendered 200x200px images of people with budget-2005-game looking faces in it?

You must be kidding me.

What ACTUALLY needs improving in this game is design decisions must be thought through. Game systems must be developed further and made deeper, as opposed to throwing a couple of unfinished, shallow, poorly thought through new systems at us with every update.

Examples of poorly thought through design?

1) Ship progression that REQUIRES people to play half a dozen different play styles, effectively telling them how to play the game (without so much as adding the convenience of being able to selectively transfer/store cargo between each specific ship they use for each of the half dozen specific jobs)

2) A UI revamp that makes menus take more clicks to accomplish the same things, display information in a more fragmented way than before and and take longer to load.

3) Ship randomization as a stand-in for actual ship customization, which is what was supposed to be the goal of the update.

Just think about it for a second - the update that was supposed to deliver ship customization had all of us switching to Pythons or dropping whatever it is we had before in our loadouts for cargo racks, planetary vehicle bays, and wake scanners... so that we can then go and roll a dice on upgrades, meaning on average everyone eventually will get equivalent shit if they bother trying enough times - **all our ships have been made MORE cookie cutter by the awesomeness of the ship customization system brought on by engineers!**

This game is fun, a lot of fun, and that's the reason all of us bother to spend some of our time pounding on FD's stupid decisions. This doesn't mean we hate the game, this doesn't mean we want it to fail, this doesn't mean we are hurting the game in any way, and this doesn't mean FD only makes stupid decisions.",1467331509

It's likely he'll stop playing soon, we've talked about it before. And since I live out of state, I won't be able to talk to him as much. You see, this game was our main source of continued friendship despite the distance. With all of our life changes its been one of our only continued shared interests and we both love the game.

What she did may have been technically legal, but certainly does violate the publics perception of her position of impartiality. A prosecutor must remain unbiased. It is a matter of public trust. In a case like this, where the players are very powerful, the public must be able to trust a prosecutor to uphold the law.

The Diaz fight is subject to so much revisionism it's mental. Conor clearly won the first round, then 2 minutes into the second gets caught, apparently loses all memory of who exactly he's fighting, and ultimately gets tapped. Nate fairly and deservedly took the win, but because he finished him. Everyone acts like Nate dry raped Conor for a round then had enough of toying with him and ended it, when it just wasn't the case. Nate then takes the hype train to its not location, where he loses and everyone knew he was a massive can the whole time. Then cue the next hype train driver. I mean, Nate is a great fighter, but 12 months ago he was the LW divisions Michael Bisping, and now he's the second coming of Christ.",1467331516

My suggestion is to respect that relationship between you and your mother. Maybe you could compromise with her and get a more unique ear piercing, if that's what she says she'll allow. The fact that she's even left that open is pretty generous as a parent.

"podemos","t5_31h78","Hola, decir que estoy de acuerdo con tu conclusión y que puede que ahí esté el motivo de la caída en confianza y transversalidad de Podemos. A nivel local los resultados de las últimas tres elecciones parece corroborarlo, al menos con los datos que tenemos de momento.

Pero discrepo ante la conveniencia de hacer un recuento paralelo. Partiendo de la base de que no dudo de la transparencia de las mesas y los recuentos de presidentes y vocales. La manipulación o trampa en las mesas es prácticamente imposible y en todo caso insignificante.

Aun así creo que es positivo hacer un recuento paralelo por dos motivos:

1. Porque podemos hacerlo. Tenemos las actas, para eso esperamos hasta el final los apoderados y apoderadas y precisamente para eso se contempla en la LOREG que cada partido disponga de una copia. Si recuperamos el motivo primero por el que se dispone de ese modo entendemos que no se trata de desconfianza ni de pataleta, sino de ejercer un derecho que con los años puede haber caído en desuso pero que supone un filtro de seguridad y garantía de nuestro sistema democrático. En ese sentido aportamos solidez al sistema electoral.

2. Por la información que obtenemos haciéndolo. No únicamente los resultados a grandes rasgos sino también la información detallada por colegios y zonas y que nos puede ayudar a tomar decisiones en el futuro. Todas las grandes organizaciones políticas lo hicieron en su momento desde lo local hasta lo nacional, lo que permitió la creación de las redes que hoy apoyan la fidelidad de los electores que, algunas veces, descansan más en la figura del vecino apoderado que en la del propio partido. Detesto este hecho, pero sería pecar de infantil obviarlo.

Dicho esto no creo, es más, estoy seguro de que los resultados apenas variarán de los oficiales y pienso firmemente que lo del ""pucherazo"" que leo por aquí carece de fundamento. Pero como simpatizante me agrada ver como las redes que hemos creado se movilizan, no por revanchismo o desconfianza, sino buscando el modo correcto de hacer las cosas.",1467331518

"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","You have to practice putting yourself in others' shoes. It won't come naturally at first. This, like many, is a journey that takes time and effort. 

Every time you remember to, try to think about what the people you see are thinking and feeling. Wonder about their life, what led them to be where they are today, how that must have all felt and does feel to them. 

And once that no longer feels like being in a weird twilight zone, start trying to apply it to those who make you angry. Whenever you can, do the same thing you did before, wonder about what got that person to where they are today, what those experiences must have felt like, what they must feel like now.

Once you've got that part down, it's much easier to have patience. You still have to always remind yourself (this is why I chose my username), but it does become possible. 

Your experience is one out of billions, and that's what led you to who you are right now and who you were in all the moments before this and who you will be in all the moments after.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","i'm the top 67 juggernaut in dotabuff(was 49 yesterday but lost two games and dropped a lot lol, ""Peek-A-Boo"") i got over 1k matches as juggernaut so i will try to give some advice (i suck at writting advice and stuff because i suck at explaining so this is going to be probably a pain to read).  


For the heroes which summon units (things like lycan, nature's, warlock, beastmaster, invoker) in cases where the enemy got any of those heroes (i'm assuming you go for the battlefury build) just try to cleave the summons in the fight when you're hitting the enemy and then use omnislash (this is too risky if the enemy got a lot of stuns so it's situational) or use omnislash on someone that isn't close to the summons.  


Another annoying thing are illusion based heroes and meepo when the enemy got any of them just get battlefury+mjollnir+manta, mjollnir and battlefury will be able to deal with the illusions when you're in omnislash and insta shield you after the omni ends so the illusions kill themselves if they focus you.  


Heroes with build in blinks (AM and QOP) you will need to bait their blink if you want to omni them, you just got to omni them as soon as they use blink (less than 1-2 seconds since they blinked), though if they have euls or manta it won't work and you're better by just ult'ing someone else in their team.

Heroes that goes invisible like slark, riki, clinkz and bounty hunter are also pretty annoying and do not try to ult them (especially slark) if they got their invis off cd or you got no detection on them, against slark the best tip i can give is to wait until he uses shadow dance to ult him.  


Items that counter omnislash are: Manta style (A well timed manta can stop your omni if no other enemy unit is in radius to jump), Euls will make you keep jumping on the hero but dealing no damage, ghost scepter/ethereal blade makes you deal no damage in omni from both your jumps and right clicks while omni, shadow blade/silver edge/glimmer cape if you got no detection they will stop your omni and i don't know if my memory is failing me but things like force staff can stop your ulti if they are timed right. (i think i forgot an item than counters jugg).  


Other heroes that can counter jugg are shadow demon with his disruption, outworld devourer and his astral (if he just used bkb omni him right away he won't be able to astral himself) just wait until he used that skill to ult him, storm with his ultimate (wait until your team silences/stun him to ult him), ember with sleight of fist and his ult (same threatment as storm), mirana if she times her leap she is able to stop omni.  


In lane try to get a kill as soon as you get omnislash, when you notice the enemy offlaner overextended by a bit you can try to spin him first to kill some lane creeps and ult right after it to kill him. in the mid game try to use omni and save it until it's necesary do not ult people that is going to die 100% because omnislash is such a big threat and if the enemy knows you don't got it they can play a lot more aggresive. (i don't know what else to say sorry if i missed some things)

""The kick is completed when the ball stops moving, goes out of play or the referee stops play for any infringement of the Laws.""

Stop play for the illegal feinting infringement. Illegal feinting does not get a do over, so caution the player, send him off, and it is failed, having been completed without a redo when the infringement of the Laws occured. From there, per the new updates to the Laws, the other team gets to reduce to equate, meaning their Goalkeeper won't have to take a kick now. Previously, you only reduced to equate at the start of kicks, but that never made a whole lot of sense. Under the old way if a player got sent off after kicks started that team would only have 10 eligible kickers and thereby could send a strong kicker up again on kick 11, while the other team would be on their goalkeeper if it got to this point. They'd benefit from having a player get sent off.",1467331521

Also, the Chinese you used is not correct.

First, ""朋友们"" (friends) is not wrong exactly, but ""朋友"" in most contexts can mean the singular or the plural. Remember only in pronouns is the plural necessary; most of the time it's clear from context (if the noun allows it at all). To give you an idea of the relative frequency, google 朋友们 vs. 朋友 and then friend vs. friends:

Chinese: 朋友们: 3.5 million hits vs. 朋友: 82 million hits (23:1 in favor of the singular)

English: friends: 1.3 billion hits vs. friend: 926 million hits (1.4:1 in favor of the plural)

Also, ""大家"" just means ""everyone,"" is not a greeting by itself, and makes no sense at the end of a sentence. So your comment said: ""My Chinese friendsss, everyone!"" which, needless to say, is part kind of awkward and part just wrong.

The purpose of the symbol is unclear - probably a warning, invocation, or religious offering. The White Walkers do this again with horse corpses in a later episode.

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","Hello patamonrs, rot public relations is on holiday so I will answer your concerns. 

It appears you have mistaken RoT to be a DMM clan, they are and always have been an 07 clan, and have always taken over the wild. Also, RoT does not care that much about killing lonesome pvmers and are instead looking to fight other clans. That is probably why they did not have tb's on them: because they dont pk for loot, they pk because they are looking for fights to pick with other clans. I don't believe rot has ever taken tbs to pks unless it involved mace/spear, to ensure they do not tele away before a spear hits them. 

If you have any more questions please leave an inbox message to Rot_public_relations on reddit and he will answer when he is back

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","Great question! I've found his versatility, like Soldier 76, is his greatest strength. A few things to consider - 

Is it an open map or a closed map? Junkrat does a lot better on smaller maps where you're in close quarters a lot, like Anubis or Gibraltar. He does a lot worse on open maps, like Hanamura or Hollywood. 

If the enemy has a powerful Pharah or Widowmaker and your team doesn't have an appropriate response, you might need to fill that response. Junkrat can be pushed into uselessness by a good one of these, provided it's on an open map. 

Does the enemy team have a lot of tanks or entrenchements? Go junkrat! Even if you can't secure kills, getting extremely quick ultimates (5 a game or so against tank heavy teams) and forcing tanks out of position is easily a winning strategy. 

Does the map have fall hazards? Junkrat, along with Pharah, Lucio, and Roadhog are great at these maps and you can easily knock a pesky Reinhardt right into the hole on Well. In fact, a team with all four of those characters on Alter or Well would probably do fine. 

Flankers aren't a big problem for junkrat - if they're on the enemy team just have your concussion blast ready to separate you two and get ready to do some damage. Long range attackers are your biggest trouble, so if they're trying to go that route swap to someone who takes care of it easily. ",1467331530

"CitiesSkylines","t5_331rj","Ever since I purchased C:S, it is the first time I have saw some serious comment from the team in the lines of improving the simulation aspect. I am very **very** glad. There is no need to call it micro-management or increasing CPU intensive, I think there are just some bad math going on that cause a lot of services and features to be more of eye-candy than really a simulated city.

So if there is an open ear, here are a few ""easy"" improvements that would go a long way to improving the game in the simulation front:

* Improve traffic AI ever so slightly to at least have a little more randomization on switching lanes, I think Traffic: President Edition advanced AI does a very decent job and on the most recent versions it seems they even don't impact that much on CPU. The most pressing issue is the ""1 lane"" bug and the ""everyone merges at the same time"" bug, oh, and when 2 highways merge, everyone goes to that **one** lane. If performance is an issue, just make it a toggle on the gameplay pane (""Advanced traffic simulation"")

* T-junctions between avenues and roads should not create a traffic light (greatly increases traffic), or allow users to toggle traffic lights on/off on T-junctions (I don't include complete intersections here because it is not realistic to have avenue intersections without traffic lights and people would exploit it, but T-junctions are very common)

* Building time on all buildings, so you can't ""fix"" any problem by just plopping the solution. ""Oh, low energy? -&gt; plop nuclear power plant"", ""oh, crime? -&gt; plop 3 police stations"". A small but noticeable time between building it and it becoming active would force people for all the alternative ways to temporarily solving a problem **that are already in game** like budget control, energy/water policies etc... while they wait the permanent fix to become ready

* Low health coverage should create more sick people/people leaving. Right now you can survive with minimal health-care with population age averaging 50!

* Crime rate should have **waaay** more noticeable effect. Right now you can have 50% crime and still manage your town

* Two words: Fire spread (minimal, rare, but possible)

* Metro &lt;-&gt; train connections so you can have overground stations for metro, or underground stations for train. I am pretty sure this would please eye-candie lovers too.

* Slightly increased metro capacity. Metro trains now offer too little capacity compared to real life, causing problems in the game too (I mod it to hold 300 people and seems to be a good compromise)

* Better noise reduction from parks and trees so we can insulate areas with it

* More air pollution spread so you are not safe from pollution by just building 6 blocks away. Perhaps some pollution going down wind direction just like water pollution goes down water direction. Since wind direction changes sometimes, this would add a whole new level of planning.

* Fix the education system to make better use of ""schools out"" and other policies. Also, make it so that homes outside of range of schools cannot use them (presently, somehow they get educated even if 2 tiles apart with no connection!?)

* More options to handle garbage and sewers. Lots of assets/mods around to give ideas but I would love a standardized vanilla one.

* **High taxes (&gt;10%) should have more negative impact on zones. I have never seen any serious effect of going as far as 15%. And getting them down also doesn't seem to do much. The moment you realize money is not a problem in the game, it throws out all simulation since you can solve anything by plopping any service you like and keeping everything on 150% =/**",1467331530

Don't see why you would recommend anyone to level blacksmithing, you get nothing out of it. As a solo player I can understand that theres some fun to be had exploring the profession but it really isn't profitable or of any personal use as most/all of the good recipes are BoE.

Personally I would recommend engineering as youll get a ton of useful items such as a teleport to Gadgetzan / Everlook / Gnomeregan, nets, grenades (3s AoE stun that breaks on damage), rocket boots (60% increased speed for 20s), rocket helm (cc someone for 30s) etc.

The point of turning friendly fire on is so people have to be careful and AVOID hitting each other. Which is the opposite of versus. Like I said before turning friendly fire on doesn't mean you need to start fighting your tribe mates.

 [artist pic](http://img2-ak.lst.fm/i/u/252/a383eb5404594c9698fc751e4118d851.png)  

&gt; Barbecue Bob (Robert Hicks, Walnut Grove, Georgia, September 11, 1902 – Lithonia, Georgia, October 21, 1931) was an American Piedmont blues musician. He used a bottleneck regularly on his 12-string guitar, playing in an elemental style that relied on an open Spanish tuning reminiscent of Charley Patton. He had a strong voice that he embellished with growling and falsetto, and a percussive singing style.

&gt; His nickname came from the fact that he was a cook in a barbecue restaurant. One of the two extant photographs of Bob show him playing his guitar while wearing a full length white apron and cook's hat.
He and his brother, Charlie Hicks, together with Curley Weaver, were taught how to play the guitar by Curley's mother, Savannah ""Dip"" Weaver. Bob began playing the 6-string guitar but picked up the 12-string guitar after moving to Atlanta, Georgia in 1923–1924. He became one of the prominent performers of the newly developing early Atlanta blues style.
In Atlanta, Hicks worked a variety of jobs, playing music on the side. While working at Tidwells' Barbecue in a north Atlanta suburb, Hicks came to the attention of Columbia Records talent scout Dan Hornsby. Hornsby recorded him and decided to use Hicks's job as a gimmick, having him pose in chef's whites and hat for publicity photos and dubbing him ""Barbecue Bob"". 

&gt; During his short career he recorded 68 78-rpm sides. He recorded his first side, ""Barbecue Blues"", in March 1927. The record quickly sold 15,000 copies and made him the best selling artist for Columbia up to that date. Despite this initial success, it was not until his second recording session, in New York during June 1927, that he firmly established himself on the race market. At this session he recorded ""Mississippi Heavy Water Blues"", a song inspired by the major floods taking place in Mississippi at that time. This song, as well as his other blues releases, gained considerable popularity, and his records sold much better than those of other local blues musicians.
The two part duet with crosstalk, ""It Won't Be Long Now"" was recorded with his brother Charlie (a/k/a Charlie Lincoln, or Laughing Charlie) in Atlanta on November 5, 1927. In April 1928 Bob recorded two sides with the female vocalist Nellie Florence, whom he had known since childhood, and also produced ""Mississippi Low Levee Blues"", a sequel to ""Mississippi Heavy Water Blues"". In April 1930, he recorded ""We Sure Got Hard Times Now"", which contains bleak references to the early effects of The Depression. Although Barbecue Bob remained predominantly a blues musician, he also recorded a few traditional and spiritual songs including ""When the Saints Go Marching In"", ""Poor Boy, Long Ways from Home"" and ""Jesus' Blood Can Make Me Whole"".
Barbecue Bob also recorded as a member of The Georgia Cotton Pickers in December 1930, a group that included guitarist Curley Weaver and harmonica player Buddy Moss. As a group they recorded a handful of sides including their own adaptation of Blind Blake's ""Diddie Wa Diddie"" (recorded as ""Diddle-Da-Diddle"") and the Mississippi Sheiks' ""Sitting on Top of the World"" (recorded as ""I'm On My Way Down Home""). These were the last recordings that Bob recorded.
He died in Lithonia, Georgia, of a combination of tuberculosis and pneumonia brought on by influenza, at the age of 29, on October 21, 1931. His recording of ""Mississippi Heavy Water Blues"" (about the 1927 flood) was apparently played at his graveside before burial.

&gt; Bob developed a ""flailing"" or ""frailing"" style of playing guitar more often associated with the traditional clawhammer banjo (as did his brother, and, initially, Curley Weaver). He used a bottleneck regularly on his 12-string guitar, playing in an elemental style that relied on an open Spanish tuning reminiscent of Charley Patton. He had a strong voice that he embellished with growling and falsetto, and a percussive singing style.

&gt; Bob had some influence on Atlanta blues musicians such as the young Buddy Moss (who played harmonica with him on The Georgia Cotton Pickers recordings), but his way of playing was quickly overshadowed by the finger-picked Piedmont blues style that rose in popularity by the late 1920s/early 30s as can be heard in the development of the recordings of Curley Weaver.
Bob's elder brother, Charley, also played blues and was recorded by Columbia under the name ""Laughing"" Charley Lincoln. However, he never received the same acclaim as his brother.

&gt; 
Robert Hicks was an extrovert young man of 24 when Columbia's Dan Hornsby arranged his first recording session in March 1927, and had only moved into Atlanta from the countryside a few years before. When he recorded He had learned guitar, along with their friend Curley Weaver, from Curley's mother; all three played in a similar style, favouring the big, booming sound of the 12-string guitar, and relishing the contrast of pulsing bass riffs with the whine of a bottleneck on the treble strings. Barbecue Blues was a good seller, but it was at his second session, in New York in June 1927, that Bob firmly established himself with black record buyers, and thus with Columbia; Mississippi Heavy Water Blues, inspired by the catastrophic floods that had occurred that very month, was a considerable seller, and as a result Robert became Atlanta's most-recorded blues singer of the 20s. It was probably his success that persuaded Columbia to record both his brother Charlie and, in 1928, Curley Weaver.
 
From the first, Barbecue Bob's music was instantly recognisable, both for the characteristic guitar style and for his warm, nasal singing voice. He could sound fiercely involved with his material, as on Barbecue Blues, ironically detached, as he did when performing Mama You Don't Suit Me!, or crushed by rejection, alike on Crooked Woman Blues and the traditionally based How Long Pretty Mama. The two-part It Won't Be Long Now, in crosstalk and duet with Charlie, is probably an example of the kind of material Robert performed on the medicine show with which he is known to have visited the small town of Waycross, in southwest Georgia, about which he made up a blues.
 
Barbecue Bob's lyrics are remarkable for their blending of traditional formulae with a wry originality that is all his own. He was well acquainted with traditional songs; the content of Barbecue Blues and Motherless Chile Blues is almost proverbial, and the session where he cut versions of two well-known gospel songs also produced Easy Rider Don't You Deny My Name and a stunning account of Poor Boy A Long Ways From Home.  Barbecue Bob rapidly impressed himself on his fans' minds as sharp, clever and original.

Why should we apologize for the supposed crimes made by the likes of ISIS, when the US has funded them? Muslims and Muslim Countries are facing 95+% of the casualties because of greedy (stupid) decisions the US has been making for over a decade, and **we** - your everyday Muslims -- are apologize on the forefront every time? No one *cares* about the people dying in non-western Countries, and instead of mourning for them, we're asked to apologize for something caused by the U.S? What kind of sickening logic are we giving into? We're the ones that deserve an apology. 

This is the kind of nonsense we need to fight against. For a women who finds her body sacred, having her hijab ""ripped"" off in public is unfathomable. Nothing - no amount of money or apologizing - in the world is ever going to give that back to her. This is animalistic, traumatizing, degrading, and absolutely unacceptable towards any human being, let alone a Muslim woman. This could've been your sister, wife, or mother people, and it will be if we don't put an end to this breach **now**. These police officers need to be sued and laid off duty, and then some; even then, I'll still be furious. 

As Muslims, we need to focus on our rights first and foremost. We're normal people trying to make a living like everyone else, we've done nothing wrong and we certainly don't need this. We've tried apologizing when *we are the victims*, and it has gotten us **nowhere**. We should've never apologized to begin with. Islam does not need to change, we need to change. We need to understand the dirty politics that have been going on for the past decade. To hell with the mistakes made by the US in creating alkaida, taliban, ISIS, and whatever they'll be creating next. To hell with their dirty politics. It's time we stop apologizing, and stand up for our rights and ourselves for god sake.

ppl will mention mobilitychamps like riven, yas, nida, lee, ..., but i personally feel like high mvspd champs can achieve the same outplay-potential by rightclicking(an art that is impossible to master, but is looked down upon as ""basic"", yet makes the difference between brazilian bronze and korean challenger)

yes, fk it, i'm saying yi, udyr, trynda and other melee carries(aka rightclickers) have as much outplaypotential as the ""combo-champs"", because they can (when perfectly played) dodge every skillshot done by ""combo-champs"". Oh and needless to say, melee carries are the hardest snowballers in the entire game, so if you're looking for rewarding, look no further.",1467331533

&gt; Race is not biological.

You can get your DNA sequenced by www.ancestry.com and it will very reliably tell you what part/parts of the world your DNA came from.  The reason it is able to do this is because the world's populations have many genetic differences that can be quantified and those differences are what makes those populations physically different from one another, as well as have different susceptibility to various genetic disorders.  These genetic differences don't exist because society wants them to.  They exist because isolated populations change genetically over time, and this happened to humans over thousands of years.

&gt; Were race “real” in the genetic sense, racial classifications for individuals would remain constant across boundaries.

Of course all cultures may not classify each other in the same way.  This doesn't mean that races aren't genetically/biologically distinct.

Few of you probably have any idea of the grind rank 14 was in WoW. 12+ hours a day for months, and massive coordination between players to get people the rank 14 one player at a time in vanilla. All for a harmless title and some cool looking (otherwise worthless) nostalgia gear to grant the bearer a little respect and to honor them for playing blizzards game for so many years.

Years later for literally no reason at all, blizzard makes the *exact* title available as a casual battleground reward. No discernible difference unless you dig through someone's achievements pages and find the 1 out of 1000+ that says they were rank 14. 

They just said 'fuck you' to the most dedicated and loyal of their playerbase for no reason at all. They couldn't even take the time to give rank 14s one extra word in their title to differentiate them. So if you think blizzard is going to allow golden guns to be unattainable to ANYONE if there's a fraction of a penny to be made on the spot, you're very mistaken. 

I thankfully quit before transmog was a thing, but that's just another way to generate a quick buck without doing any extra work, all while giving a big fuck you to the dedicated and loyal players.

I can't wait for all these starry-eyed new blizzard customers to get a big steaming shit on everything they've worked for in game because it'll appease some guy on the forums that started playing last week and will have quit to play the new CoD by next month.

The options that the Anaheim City Council had in front of them included regulations and standards on all AirBnB hosts. Instead, they chose to ban short-term rentals completely instead of making a good-faith effort to work with local operators. To me, that screams ""hotel industry money and lobbyists"" rather than ""what's really in the interest of Anaheim and the tourism economy?""",1467331541

Since the way it's often used here is a deliberate lie that should come with jail time and consequences, and since that's legally what a ""falsely reporting a claim"" charge is, that's the definition I tend to go with. I don't think that people who genuinely believe they were taped and were merely sexually assaulted or even not a victim of a crime at all should be considered ""false accusers"". Another reason why I think consent needs to be included in sex education. Both men and women need to understand what it means.",1467331541

In the middle of my diagram, those short sections of multilane roads are actually narrow; too narrow to share with a car. I am going to take the lane from now on. Thank you.

Question: how can I move to the left if the car behind me wants to turn right (red light, but right turn permitted)?

"bangtan","t5_2zqih","I'm 19 and I discovered BTS back in November/December 2015. So I'm fairly new to the fandom. And I'm not a native english speaker.

I've been on Tumblr for a few years now, and I remember seeing pictures of Yoongi on my dashboard (he had green/blue hair back then) and finding him really hot. I knew kpop was a thing, and I also knew some groups by name (like EXO or SNSD) but I thought Bangtan Boys and BTS were two diffferent groups. I knew that that guy I thought was hot was in either Bangtan or BTS, and after some weeks I started recognizing Jimin by his orange hair (I actually thought just by the pictures I had seen that Jimin was a really macho kind of guy and that his voice was hella deep) and Taehyung (I followed a girl whose bias was Tae, and she reblogged many pictures of him. I also misjudged him by the pics and thought he was shy and quiet)

When HYYH pt 2 came out some of the people I followed started reblogging the songs, and I listened to RUN. I loved it and downloaded it, and for a whole month I listened to RUN on repeat. Only after that I decided I wanted to know a little bit about who they were. It was then I realized that Yoongi, Jimin and Taehyung were all in the same group. 

I started watching Rookie King and then moved on to AHL. Then I watched all the MVs. And then every other show they've been in. I remember I could only recognize Taehyung and Yoongi at first. I thought their aliases were hilarious: especially Rap Monster. I still can't get used to call Taehyung 'V'. But 'Suga' fit with Yoongi, in my opinion. 

He was my bias even before I knew what BTS was, lmao. He's my ult bias and I don't think I could ever change that. I usually fall for guys with his personality so that was surprising when I started to get to know him.

the current stats for it are:

+200 Health
+10% Cooldown Reduction
+20% Attack speed
+10% Movement Speed

plus the passive where it increases the duration of relic effects by 50%. while the base stats itself are good, they generally gravitate more towards the hunter/jungle side of things. where as if it was a MUST item, solo could probably pick up something far better. but with the way its passive works, this item sits along the lines of situational, because the passive is only as useful as the item/active composition on your team. if sprint is picked up, its a plus, same with frenzy. as well as for high CC enemy comps or high DPS enemy comps, to prolong the effects of beads and aiges. but ultimately it doesn't seem as a MUST have on anyone at the moment.",1467331545

You're not proving it, I said show me the purple stuff surrounding stuff he is currently moving. You're saying that there is only purple stuff around what he controls. So show him controlling something that is surrounded by purple.

&gt;A meteor's terminal velocity must be at least 11 km/s, which is its impact velocity. any object that enters Earth's gravitational pull must always be going at that speed.

That's the speed of atmospheric entry. Once it's in the atmosphere it loses it's speed. 

&gt;So I guess the 1200 m wide Winslow Meteor Crater is just a giant man-made hole meant to trick gullibel tourists into visiting it

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Your thinking is backwards. The fact that tech is advancing so quickly is the reason why you shouldn't spend anywhere near 9 grand on a computer today, or ever.

One, a ten-year rebuild cycle for high-end gaming hardware is simply not realistic nor cost-effective. Your 6950X is not a good processor for gaming to begin with, by the way. A 6700K will be faster in basically every game thanks to its 4 GHz clock speed. Also, you can replace that 6700K with the latest mainstream K-model i7 _four_ times during those 10 years for the price of your one 6950X. Realistically speaking, you'll only feel the need to replace it maybe once. Moore's law is close to over for CPUs; I'm still running an i7-2600k from 2011 and it never hits 100% utilization.

Two, you're buying a computer now that you expect to run games that _don't exist yet_, at high framerates. We have no idea what the hardware requirements for VR games published in 2020 will be; SLI'd 1080s might be peasant tier by then.

Unless money is literally not at all a factor in your life, you should buy hardware that will run the games that exist when you buy it at the speed you want. If that means you should wait until Camelot is released and see how it benchmarks, then wait.",1467331546

People really overstate the anti-tourist thing.  It does kind of happen, but it makes sense if you think about it.

We all get tourist-stupid.  Like, you're in a new place, it's beautiful, you're all stoked and just totally enjoying your surroundings.  So, without thinking about it, you're driving ten miles below the speed limit on the only two lane road that circles the island.

It's not a huge deal, and it happens to everyone when they travel.

So while you're just cruising in heaven some guy cuts around you, leans out the window, and yells something rude.

It sucks.  Takes you out of the moment.  Very negative experience.

So people go home with these terrible stories about how mean everyone is.

But they don't consider, that guy isn't on vacation.  He's at home.  He lives in one of the most expensive places on earth.  He's late for a job he hates but desperately needs.

And you're the twentieth lollygagging tourist he's had to deal with today.  So he snapped and lashed out.  It isn't a great way to behave, but it is understandable. And forgivable.

That same guy is gonna be super kind and welcoming in any other situation.  But life is hard and sometimes we react negatively toward people who don't really deserve it.

Have fun on your trip.  Don't forget to stop by the Dole Cannery for a Dole Whip.  It's the cheesiest tourist trap ever, but Dole Whips are heaven and you can't get them anywhere else.",1467331550

Mini skidsteer (kanga, digga etc) has an easier learning curve,  first time I hired one it took me all of like 15 minutes to get the hang of it (bruised legs teach you really quickly to take it easy when turning).   Better awareness of where you are and good for tight space access. 
  
Bobcat,  I found harder  the first time because the bucket is controlled by your feet,  which is counter Intuitive and takes some getting used to.  Up side is its arguably safer (for the operator- not anyone else around,  terrible stories about people backing over their kids in these),  and you will have bigger capacity in the bucket so better to move more dirt quicker.

I just spent a lot of research picking out a good quality tv.. I spent 750 on a 55 inch vizio m series 4k. This hdr shit didn't start popping up until 2 months after I bought my tv (when slim was announced) and I'm just not that pissed. 

My tv has exceptional local dimming, despite no hdr. And it has 17ms input lag. Great for gaming. 

A tv that is better than mine, I'd easily be paying double what I paid for. My tv is top tier for its price range. I'm not willing to buy a teenagers first car money on a tv. 


This hdr shit is so new, it's going to be expensive. And the cheap ones... Well, it's not exactly hdr. Just like when 4k first came out, you had all these cheaper tvs promoting they do 4k,but it wasn't true 4k. Now you have cheaper hdr tvs saying it does hdr, but it's not TRUE hdr. 

You better pony up and pay the money, or just wait. But I'll be damned if you tell me my blacks aren't black, and my picture isn't vibrant. In fact, this video almost proves it. Both clips were exceptional. They just had different tones. Unless you are side by side, you would never notice the difference, because they both look correct. Just different temperatures. 

I think what really pisses me off is the images coming out. 4k is washed out as fuck, and hdr looks like the contrast was improved 70 percent. That shit I just don't believe.",1467331555

That is true, but also a bit of a strawman. The entire point of training is to learn techniques -- the martial -- as a body of phsyiological and psychological theory -- the art.

We do not practice our paired kata work in order to kill each other. We do so to learn at first very specific and basic body mechanics, and then eventually more advanced weapons techniques, and finally use that understanding the grasp the theory of our art, and ultimately embrace the ability and decision to kill and therefore also how to live (which I will suggest hasn't been truly mastered by anyone under the age of 80 since we don't kill each other anymore in such a martial weapons context.)

So specifically, yes I am trying to make my opponent's technique fail; I am trying to lure him into a position of weakness where my technique will succeed (sometimes not killing but merely immobilizing or wounding), I am trying to use his attack to my advantage and his detriment, I am trying to stay alive long enough to end him, I am trying to negate the effectiveness of his attacks such that he finally sees the error of his ways and gives up...

And again, gekiken is done in the context of (mainly) Toyama-ryu, an art that is not koryu, and only involves single kata (some very minimal formal, paired kata), and cutting.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Stat boosts are multipliers, so the higher the stat the bigger the boost. One boost is identical to a STAB (same type attack bonus, if a normal type Pokemon uses a normal type move it does more damage than if a non normal type Pokemon uses the same move). Two boosts is the same multiplier as a super effective hit. Stats are boosted in stages going as high as +6 and as low as -6. All stats begin at zero. If a move raises a stat that is +1 and a multiplier of x1.5. If a moves sharply raises a stat that is a +2 and a multiplier of x2. If you are at +3 in a stat that is x2.5. Each stage increases the multiplier by +.5 so at +6 your stat is four times greater than what it is at the beginning of the battle. So early in the game when your Pokemon have low stats like 10 a +1 boost makes the stat 15. When you're higher leveled and your stat is 120 then your +1 makes your stat 180. For minus stats instead of multipying, you divide. So a Pokemon with a stat of 100 at -1 will have that stat at 67. These stats are used when calculating damage. So a Pokemon at +2 in attack will do twice as much damage as it would at neutral zero. A Pokemon with +2 in defense will take half as much damage as it would without stat boosts. Similarly a Pokemon with -2 defense will take twice as much damage than it would normally. A Pokemon with -6 defense will take four times as much damage as normal. These multipliers are independent of level or a Pokemons stats but their effect is larger and more noticeable at higher levels because the Pokemon have high stats to begin with.

There's no simple way in the default UI as far as I know, but quite a long time ago I made a macro that would accomplish that and several variations. The only problem is that you'd need to reapply it after every UI reload (basically loading screens etc), since it's non-persistent. I also made an addon called Enabler that allows autorunning lua code without wrapping it in a seperate addon so one can autorun macros in cases like these, but I haven't had time to even look at it for a very long time. In any case the macros are the following:

Only show the tooltip when the Alt-button is held down:

     /eval local a = Apollo.GetAddon(""ToolTips"") local b = a.UnitTooltipGen a.__index.UnitTooltipGen = function (...) if Apollo.IsAltKeyDown() then b(...) else local self,tmp = ...  tmp:SetTooltipForm(nil)  tmp:SetTooltipFormSecondary(nil) end end

Move the tooltip to bottom right and only show it when the Alt-button is held down:

     /eval local a = Apollo.GetAddon(""ToolTips"") local b = a.UnitTooltipGen a.__index.UnitTooltipGen = function (...) if Apollo.IsAltKeyDown() then b(...) local nScreenWidth,nScreenHeight = Apollo.GetScreenSize()  Apollo.SetNavTextAnchor(nScreenWidth, false, nScreenHeight, false) else local self,tmp = ...  tmp:SetTooltipForm(nil)  tmp:SetTooltipFormSecondary(nil) end end

Move the tooltip to top left and change its scale to 0.5:

     /eval local a = Apollo.GetAddon(""ToolTips"") local b = a.UnitTooltipGen a.__index.UnitTooltipGen = function (...) local c = a.wndUnitTooltip b(...) Apollo.SetNavTextAnchor(0, true, 0, true) if c then c:SetScale(0.5) end end

Rotating about the x-axis can be done either with the washer method and dx, or with the shell method and dy.

Rotating about the y-axis can be done either with the washer method and dy, or with the shell method and dx.

Think about how you would write the volume of a single square slice at the value x, with thickness dx. The volume of this box would be the thickness (dx) times the area of the square. Since a square here will have height √x-(x/2)  [the distance between the two curves], it'll have the same length as well, so the area is this the same as the height^(2). So the volume of each chunk is (√x-(x/2))^(2)*dx. Now toss an integral sign in front of this with limits from 1 to 4.",1467331563

"perth","t5_2r78m","&gt; That's your first question?

Yes. 

&gt; You want to know what trite marketing nonsense someone has come up with to appeal to prospective customers?

Anybody who knows anything about IT strategy (or business strategy) knows that a Vision is where that strategy starts. Whilst this is subject to misuse by cynical marketers (as you indicate) that does not mean it has no value if used for the right reasons and in the right way. And (cue surprise, shock and horror) those of us within the industry with professionalism and integrity do not set cynical and unethical marketing behaviours as the qualitative benchmark we seek to attain, so the fact that a strategic vision is misused in that way is neither here nor there.

Specifically for IT, the *only* recognised IT Service Management *framework* in existence outlines the 4 P's of Strategy very very clearly, and ... If a company has no Vision, then quite simply means that the company has no idea what their strategy is. And if they haven't considered strategy that means their tactical and operational activities will be analogous to a galloping headless chook. I shouldn't have to explain this to someone who actually knows what a Vision is and what it's meant to provide a business.

&gt; If you're leading with that question, it weakens everything that follows

I'm leading with that question because, simply put, it informs and *is a fundamental prerequisite to everything that follows* - knowing whether the company actually has a strategy is so fundamental that there's no point considering the company as a decent employer or market leader through further questions if the answer to this question is not the right one. Again, I shouldn't have to explain this to an informed observer.

Yes, it's aggressive questioning. The post positioned the employer as an emerging market leader, or at least it did before it was deleted. So simply put they either walk the talk, or should not be making disingenuous representations about their company.

Integrity is everything, reputation is everything, accountability is everything, or at least it is if you're not lurching from contract to contract ripping clients off and wallowing in professional mediocrity in some shitful rhinestone cowboy outfit. The aggressive questioning is basically demanding accountability and integrity on the part of the company posting the position. See I have this thing called professional pride? It means that not only do I hold myself accountable within my profession for doing the right thing, I demand and expect others within my industry to act with a similar professionalism. Or, to be frank, they can get the fuck out of my industry and leave the job of providing enterprise services to the grown-ups.",1467331568

They're much better than the Cherry equivalent which are MX Browns.

Just make sure it looks like it's in good condition because dirty ALPS feel nasty. Older models (without Windows keys) are slightly better.

And there's no risk, they're cheap, built well, highly moddable (you can mod them into linear or clicky with no soldering) and I guarantee you will at least like it more than any rubber dome.

"lolphp","t5_2rt7j","&gt; No, it's not that hard and it is guaranteed to be more efficient (both in CPU time and memory-wise) than implicit recursion.

Guaranteed to be more efficient? Why are you so convinced of this? It is in principle easy to turn a recursive destruction into an iterative one if you don't care about performance, just keep sticking everything in a worklist. However, unless you happen to hit the degenerate case discussed here, managing this worklist is bound to have a non-trivial performance hit (and destruction is a critical code-path), if only because you end up visiting each element twice.

An additional complication is that extension objects are non-homogeneous, so this has to be handled in a generic manner, where the outermost dtor performs the worklist based destruction, while all inner ones only insert to the list. This may lead to violations of assumptions about where precisely a value is destroyed (no longer at the point of invocation of the dtor) and about the order of destruction (as destructions would be reordered from DFS to BFS order -- I see no way to avoid that, again due to the necessity of being generic).

Maybe I'm just too stupid for this, as you imply, but I really don't think this is as trivial as you make it out to be. (If I may say so, the discrepancy derives from the fact that you see this as an abstract problem, with an equally abstract simple solution, while I am considering specific issues of implementation and language semantics.)",1467331569

Downside: If you so much as dare equip a shield in a party, people are going to label you as the ""tank"" of the party instantly unless there's a Pelt3. They still might label you as the tank anyway just for being Pelt1. Kind of an issue with Swordsman in general right now though

Gung Ho cannot be used with Guardian simultaneously, so keep that in mind. They'll cancel the other buff out instantly upon cast. Mind you, evasion does nothing for you against magic mobs, so the extra damage from Gung Ho can still be a boon. Personally opted for Bash level 3 instead for the knockdown attribute. Kind of nice for throwing mobs into others' AoE

Guardian level 5 is unnecessary unless you hate rebuffing, the extra damage loss vs defense gained isn't really worthwhile. You could just not use the skill points since Rim Blow is kind of pointless to get

I prefer Helm Chopper over Cleave. Cleave does great damage on stunned mobs, except bosses can't be stunned. Helm Chopper hits twice, so whatever damage you see X 2. Satisfying as heck doing a critical cleave on stunned mobs though. Your call on this since the stun rate Barbarian dishes out is pretty decent, and you still have Fencer skills for dealing with bosses anyway

You can buy encoders specifically to convert arcade buttons to USB controllers. Popular ones are the iPac2 and Xin Mo. Fightstick guys like one called a PS360+ because it's very low latency. These support many buttons and may even be able to appear as a PS3 or X360 controller. iPac2 and Xin Mo seem to work well on Pi. I've never seen someone using a PS360+ on Pi.

Another common arcade encoder is the Zero Delay, maybe made by Reyann or DragonRise (there are many brands selling the same board). A few people on here have been reporting strange problems with these on Pi lately, so I wouldn't recommend using a Zero Delay at the moment.

A super-cheap way is like you said, buy a $5 USB SNES controller, pull the board out of it, and solder your button wires to the controller pads, and mount the board inside so it doesn't rattle around and short out. Most people solder the pads on then hot-glue them so the joints don't move around much.

Lebanese gangs are a different story. They are obviously very anti-Semitic, but they're not exactly friendly to non-Jews either. I don't consider them a representation of the Australian Lebanese community.

The general community is probably the same as other Australian communities (including White Australians) - some hate Jews, some like Jews, some love Jews, some are indifferent. Just like other communities, the more hateful and ignorant people are usually the less-educated ones.

There is a very good chance that if OP brings this to the attention of the school, the teacher will lose his job/ livelihood.

A better scenario may be for OP to talk directly to her teacher, so that instead of losing his job, he has a chance to make a change to how he conducts his hobby so it doesn't hurt his students or himself.

A mi de pequeño me enseñaron que acusar a alguien de tramposo sin pruebas era lo peor que se podía hacer, porque si no lo es...te quedas marcado para siempre por bocazas.

Mas de 100.000 personas y una acusación formal en las redes sociales de hacer una trampa que ha costado a Podemos un millón y medio de votos.

O sea, que esos votos estaban en las urnas y no se han contado...los han hecho desaparecer...o los han llevado a otro lado sin que la dirección de Podemos haya (hasta ahora) notado nada...

En la sopa de twitter, y en la sopa de las redes sociales, oigo (cualquiera puede oir) a todo el mundo, gente del PSOE, de C´s...no he oido a nadie más que a la militancia activa de Podemos quejarse.

A nadie más...

Cualquier cosa vale antes de pensar ""algo habremos hecho mal para que los votos con los que contábamos no hayan caído en la cesta, vamos a ver con calma que ha pasado...""

Y si, el ministro es un  XXXXXX, si, lo firmo como tu y cualquiera... y todo lo que tu quieras....pero son los mismos que estaban el 20D; y ya habían hecho esas cosas de las grabaciones...que son de 2013, y se sabía que espiaba...Si hacían eso en 2014...¿Cómo dejó que el 20D Podemos sacara esos estupendos 71 diputados?...Y estuviera en posición de ganar Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia...Fue todo muy limpio, nadie se quejó...porque esperaban eso o aproximado.

Y el 20D no se quejó ni Blas. Porque los resultados que esa gente maligna, mentirosa y manipuladora, nos dio...nos gustaron.

Hello there, I don't normally do this but I'm in a position right now where I have no choice. Recently obtained a 4 day flying job for the July 4th weekend which I am excited about as I'm on the verge of homelessness and have been searching endlessly for a job. The problem I'm faced with is that it's a 90 mile per day drive and I am flat broke right now. I simply need a little bit of money to cover my fuel and perhaps any other misc expense. Can discuss any sort of interest.   
  
I would like to use my Square Cash account for payment as it is instant, where PayPal requires up to 4 business days to transfer into my bank account. I have used Square for years and it is perfectly safe. My Square link is right here: https://cash.me/$CraigLowers

No. *Things that do things* decrease performance, but in many cases Tile Entities are also used for completely static objects that are not updated, simply because they need to hold a bit more data than regular blocks can handle.

Jon Snow proceeds to punch Ramsey in to a bloody pulp on the brink of death.  Only leaving him alive so his sister Sansa can feed him to his own hounds.

The requirement of proving some official membership in a terrorist organization (who often have a decentralized aspect by design) is something meant to murk the waters when Islam is the obvious culprit.  Your proposition is silly because it suggests that somebody who reads the Qu'ran, listens to imam speeches, and then decides to conduct a mass casualty attack ""Isn't an Islamic terrorist"" all because they didn't have ""official membership"" in an ""official organization"". What a joke.  The distinction is breathtakingly dumb and is purposefully meant to confuse.

Also, as for his personal issues being a bigger factor?  Prove it. It's also not habitual for a person even with identical personal issues to his to go out like he did.  Islam was definitely the prime catalyst.  And again, two adjectives can describe one guy.  He was an Islamist with a ton of personal issues.",1467331581

"natureismetal","t5_324zi","Almost garaunteed to be a neurotoxic pesticide ingestion which presents identically to nerve gas poisoning (because that's what nerve gas is). What the snake is showing is very similar to a clonic-tonic reaction and if the resolution was better we'd likely see excessive amounts of secretions from the mouth. the most common progression is excessive drooling, an initial spasm, followed by all muscles clenching/contracting at once causing a near complete paralysis of the victim, followed shortly by death. I'd lay very good odds that if the snake were to have been injected with Atropine, Diazapam, and 2-pam, (presuming these commonly used reversal agents are not toxic to snakes) it would immediately reverse the effects.

Most rat-poison in the U.S. is actually not neurotoxic as many people here are posting, but rather hemorrhagic in nature causing the rodent to bleed to death internally. Warfarin, a drug used to prevent heart attacks, is the most common active ingredient in these poisons, albeit in much, much higher doses than what we prescribe therapeutically. The most common source of neurotoxins in the household is in the form of various bug sprays; this should hammer home why if a residence is being treated for insects to wait at least the minimum amount of time before re-occupying the house with yourself, children, and pets. Especially pets, as they may be more prone to licking areas that have been treated due to the new/unusual smell.

I don't have to address your comment in order so I won't lol.

Copy and paste is a mainstay of replying in online community forums tactics and anyone like me who has thrived in such places knows it. It will remain that way long after the earth crumples lol.

Any online forum mod (with more sense than you) will keep a list of links, signatures, bookmarks, text, and other info close at hand and ready to paste at will. 

You have to. Maybe with your so called gaming experience you never had to copy/paste. You were never that useful or busy.

From talking with the devs teams across 1password, dropbox, etc, if you're afraid to consistently use copy/paste to a person in a forum topic (when appropriate) you have no place trying to be one of their mods. There's just too many users and topics to manage.

So, yes, I said it twice. You need severe help immediately. Technically, is that a third time? Yeah, I guess so lol.

Hey, are you happy at least this time I didn't copy and paste it?

And don't even try to play the innocent act on me or the mods here, because you just came right out from the start calling me an idiot.

So get used to that specific copy and paste too. I'm only going to reply to you when I feel like it. I'm answering this because it's for everyone else's benefit. Not yours.

And on a community forum/reddit level, you and a couple others I won't name their handle at the moment, want to try pointing out a rare spelling mistake or so I may make, which usually is on purpose.

But never mind the tons of other users that don't have English as their native tongue. I don't make fun of them. But, again, people like you, sure, go ahead and mock me - only because I make the religious offense of daring to question your holy game makers.

Now, haha, on to the best part of your comment. The not you/me part.

I never worked for BioWare or their related companies. I still don't. I won't. I have great memories. But I've ""retired"" from game design.

Plus at the time, when you're easily clearing $93K and don't have to answer to anyone, managing arguably the most successful mod team that schools and universities want to use (as they now have Minecraft), why on earth would I want to move thousands of miles away from family and friends to continue working on a project that I can just keep doing from home? Without all their red tape.

But typical, people like you will assume that's all a failure on my part.

As if because I don't work for a gaming company now that my work or work ethics aren't good enough.

So, that explained, hopefully to everyone else that clears some stuff up.

Again, this has absolutely nothing to do with answering thedrizztman because he's not worth my time answering. I'm answering and explaining this for the benefit of the rest of you.

Exactly the same as if anyone else asked me the same thing.

There are some people who refuse to consider the fact that these sorts of things could be effectively and fairly implemented because they have been conditioned (rightly or wrongly) to fear government intrusion. That's not an unfair concern, but where it breaks down is when they seem unwilling to entertain the idea that ""the other side"" is bargaining in good faith and that there concerns can be effectively addressed. Instead, some (many?) turn their back and say ""I gave up my right to bayonet lugs and that didn't work and so I'm not giving up more.""

Depending on how engaged you want to be beyond the election I'd recommend considering [Vote Flux](https://voteflux.org/) (also at /r/voteflux) when it comes to you're options in the Senate. They're attempting to hack a slightly more egalitarian approach to policy into our current political system. Their members, if elected, become true proxies within parliament with all policy decisions opened to voting from an app. You can either remain directly involved, voting on each bill personally, or delegate your votes to an expert within that area of policy.

Have a look at the Port Mann bridge for example. Due to tolls, the bridge has not met its expected traffic volumes. The result would likely be the same on a massive Massey Bridge with a toll.

All I'm saying is that the government needs to focus more on moving *people* around the region, not cars, and they need to consider a more balanced approach where more efficient transit options are also considered. ",1467331590

3) Define breaking the laws of the universe.

"FeMRADebates","t5_2y44v","&gt;Which side are you on? Do you believe representations of weapons in toy sets just bring out ""playful aggressive behaviour"" that's already in those kids or do you believe they have formative effect on children?

At worst it's an healthy outlet. Wanna punch someone? Go play your PS4 Lego game and punch Lego Batman, destroy bricks, etc.

It has as much 'formative effect' as 'rough tumbling play' has. It's something physical, involves problem solving, adrenaline, and little danger. Kittens also do it, instinctively.

&gt;Do you believe weapons/violence in toys or child's play represent masculinity? Toxic masculinity even?

Not really. They're often a narrative tool. If you want a story that involves heroes, and villains, and it's not Doctor Who, there'll be violence (even in Doctor Who there is violence, the Doctor himself just doesn't use weapons).

&gt;Is a Lego set without weapons/violence a feminine toy? A toy that boys are less likely to prefer? 

If the toy involves no action, it might be less preferred. I personally don't see the attraction to salon Lego Friends sets, and playing pretend about going 2 hours doing nothing while someone plays in your hair. There's no action involved, not even pretend action.

&gt;What is a ""normal"" gender neutral toy and which are the criteria a toy must not have in order to be gender neutral? (not pink? no weapons?)

I think the regular 'city' Lego, or Basic blocks are pretty neutral. I also think most franchises, even if they're marketed to boys, are neutral. Hero stories are not uniquely masculine. Whereas feminine toys about going to a salon and playing dress up are considered uniquely feminine.

A woman can become a hero (even one who breaks a few jaws), even if getting the muscle may be harder without testosterone. A man has few fashion options without becoming an outcast, a weirdo. 

Regardless of his degree of desire to express himself through clothing and hairstyles, he won't have the opportunity to, in most fields. So if a boy is attracted to the pretend play of it, it's likely due to not being able to do it for real, rather than rehearsal for later.

Until that changes (boys are men are allowed much much more freedom of expression without being fired, not hired, or killing their romantic prospects), appearance-based stuff will be seen as uniquely girly.",1467331591

Seriously, though, I didn't ask you to do a point by point discussion before you condemn someone.  I said it's a nasty thing to ask someone else to condemn someone without having that discussion.  YOU can condemn anyone you like for any reason or for no reason, I don't care.  You did note that I mentioned it's hard to be friendly with people who say they want to kill you, right?  You did see that part?

You should, if you can, have the discussion because Hamas appeals to people, maybe for not-killing-Jews reasons.  If you knew what those reasons were, maybe you could find a non-Hamas solution to suggest to someone who isn't aware of an alternative.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","I get where you're coming from, but the difference is how the ""entire group"" deals and looks at the stupid individuals. 


I'll start with cops since it's not really a GG/KiA issue. Sure, cops arn't 100% bad. Most cops you meet probably just want to do their job and make sure no ones to big of an asshole. Some are shitstains that will nail your balls to the wall for weed but whatever. But it'd be stupid to deny there are really bad apples. Right? right. So how do they deal with the bad apples? if a cop gets caight in a blatent act of racism or abuse of power or excessive force, what do they do? they cover his ass. At best, they'll put him on trial, he'll get a slap on the wrist, and he'll get another job being a cop in another city. and that's **if** they actually do something that is 100% bullshit and there's no ignoring it. If a cop steals 20k from you with no proof of a crime, oh well fuck you. Cops won't even have to cover their ass they'll jsut tell you to fuck off. So people see that and they don't fucking trust cops. 

Now look at matress girl. Sure, one girl false flagging rape and making a spectical about it doesn't mean all of feminism is bad. but the massive amount of feminist support and positive media attention **after** it was outed that it was proven false speaks bad for the entire group. 

Then we have the BLM leader who got caught for sex trafficking a minor. Sure, doesn't speak bad for BLM. but when BLM tuns around and defends him, they shit the bed then and there. 

In contrast, remember the Davis Aurini? once most of gamergate kind found out what was going on with him they pretty much shut him out. Lots of prominant GG/mra/skeptics/anti feminism took a whack at him.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Have you ever been to one of these ""factory"" farms? I doubt it. That's because the narrative people keep getting fed largely doesn't exist in reality. You can read [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4qnrg2/eli5_how_is_it_scientists_are_finding_links/d4uov7u) for more background, but I've worked in agriculture for awhile now and worked with big and small farmers too. The bigger farmers often have more resources on hand to prevent stress and health issues, and they can't afford not to either.

This cop out comes up pretty often in these discussions. It's always some variant of it's not you, but it's those *other* evil guys out there. There's always some boogeyman out there for people not familiar with agriculture, but when you actually learn about and get involved with things like livestock, it's laughable to see people make these appeals to ""factory farms"" [97%](http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2015/03/0066.xml&amp;printable=true) of our farms in the US are family owned.

Many insects are able to 'walk' on water or at least float easily enough to safety. Ant colonies of some species can also create rafts, Google 'ant rafts' for images. They are then deposited in a new location when levels drop. 

Someone with more knowledge of flooding and water soil interaction may be able to confirm or deny this but I suspect in a flood that maybe only the first few feet of soil may become saturated as infiltration can be quiet slow in many soils, especially in heavy clays often found on frequently flooded plains. Leaving the majority of the vadose to the water table still a mix soil air and water. So deeper colonies should be ok. ",1467331591

&gt; The internet has been ablaze the past few weeks about Apple potentially removing the headphone jack from the next iPhone - a move that&amp;#039;s been heavily rumored for months, and has everything from blurry leaked case images to Wall Street Journal articles backing it up.

&gt; Anyway! One of the most strongly-held arguments about Apple removing the headphone jack is that Apple has historically been first to drop a legacy technology, sometimes even before the rest of the industry is ready.

&gt; You can see how most Apple I/O standards come to a quick end after the first phase out, but the headphone jack has been the one constant Apple connector for 32 years, twice the usual lifespan.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","&gt;   Kickstarter would need a huge staffincrease to allow for the rules to be really productivly enforced.
Writeing a few lines on developement every few weeks is easy. How would Kickstarter know that what was written isn't totally bogus though?

 I think this could largely be handled by backers. There'd come a point when backers would become suspicious and possibly have gathered some proof that work probably isn't being done. Once enough of them had flagged the project and given KS some idea of what to look for, KS would start some basic investigation. 

 For example, they could tell KS that the devs have said in several updates that the characters' animations are completely done (as per the schedule), but have so far avoided showing any video proof of this in updates and have dodged the question whenever asked for it. It wouldn't take KS much work to just ask the devs for a link to the update that has the animation videos in it. 

&gt; On the other hand, noone is able to predict the developement of a project, no matter how much experience they have in the market. For this to not be a problem, devs would need a way to adjust their monthly payments.
How will they justify that though? If the backers would need to vote if they increase or decrease their monthly allowance you can bet they won't get a dime. Why? Because 99% of those backing things on Kickstarter don't have the slightest clue of selfemployment and/or gamedevelopement. They would only see a dev failing and asking for more money to fix it.

 That is a good question, I hadn't thought of that. Although, increasing monthly allowance means the money will run out sooner, and either way the backers aren't going to be paying any more; so possibly if the increase wasn't too sharp, the reason was well explained and documented, and the work seemed to be going well so far, backers may be reasonable and allow it. 

 Anyways, anything I'm suggested they do, would be done with very forgiving parameters towards the devs and KS. Require a large number of backer complaints before KS takes action, allow some small changes in budget and timespans without too much oversight, do basic automated checks (that yes, could be easily duped by dishonest devs), etc... I think that the majority of KS devs are not trying to game the system and the majority of backers are not part of the loud pitch-fork mob, so even some basic stuff that they devs could circumvent with enough effort, would be enough to improve the majority of projects. Like how many Uni courses will have you meet with the prof once in a while to show progress on major projects; you could easily show them fake progress, and there isn't usually any real punishment for getting behind, but it does help to keep on track.

&gt;The only thing that I really would want Kickstarter to implement, is the need to publish a full financial plan on what when and how they will finance in their project. Something which could be checked by the hivemind of the internet.
That way we might be able to combat the rampant underfunding of projects, just so the devs get at least some part of the funding they need. It's an illpractice that needs to be curbstomped by the backers and the platform. Sadly, I have no clue how to combat it :D 

 This would be a good idea. Most large, well run projects already do a very basic version of this (those pie charts), and I'm kind of surprised KS doesn't have some basic checklist of stuff you have to include in a pitch (like that Red Ash pitch that didn't even have like, concept art for the first week...).",1467331596

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","Sports + tracking could be a big one. Companies like Opta employ huge amounts of labor to track and monitor soccer games, where trackers manually inspect games to curate a set of statistics (touches, passes etc.) Of course, this would need a complimentary device (not a phone) to establish the relationship between a player and a ball (sensor would be inside), but that somewhat depends on how this device is implemented; does it use Bluetooth, NFC or RFID?

Another use could be to detect absence/presence for events, offices and classrooms. And then if you can sync it up with Apple/Android pay, and if these sensors become really cheap, then people could buy things by simply picking them up and tapping a button on the sensor. And once the sensor on the item syncs with the device to confirm payment, you could detach the sensor and put it in a discard box to make these sensors reusable!

Personally, just having a log of things/objects you use each day would be incredible -- similar to Google's timeline feature, it can allow us to relive memories in a richer way as our memory fetching models are very context-heavy ([Thinking, Fast and Slow](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555)). This log could also potentially be incorporated in an AI model (like Siri's or Google's), so that your home could be more intelligently automated, as you'll probably have patterns to things you do everyday.

Not to mention that there's plenty of black guys with light skin who wouldn't necessarily be identifiable.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Yes actually. I was expecting a lot more criticism of religion here. I'll just repost what I've already said about my views on anarchism and religion. 

Most anarchists I've met here in France go from distrusting but tolerating to disliking religion intensely (to the point where even I, known by my friends and comrades to be quite materialistic and anticlerical, feel uncomfortable), dunno how it is in other countries. The few here I have met that are sympathetic to religion were the kind of people that read the horoscope and bought homeopathy.

I'd say most anarchists everywhere can agree organized religion goes against anarchism because it's a form of hierchary that can be and has often been used as a tool for oppression and power in the service of an elite.

I'd say religion is pretty dangerous for an anarchist society. If people fanatically believe in an all powerful authority, it's easy to just derail that society into an oppressive state so long as people believe it's the just thing to do because the entity (or rather its supposed representatives) says so.

I think religion is alienating, goes against free thinking and isn't compatible with anarchism but you're free to disagree.
On a purely personal note, until proven the contrary, religion, sects, superstition, spiritualism is just a bunch of stuff invented by humans for varying intentions. From trying to explain what seems unexplainable to manipulating people into servitude to trying to find some sort of inner peace and happiness.

While sometimes fueled by good intensions, I feel religion is an obstacle to humans solving problems. It's a way of avoiding or trying to ignore them. Instead of trying to find explanations as to why something is, bullshit it away. To calm a serf revolt the priest promises them that there will be equality in paradise, that they will have their vengeance in paradise. That they should continue to follow the teachings of the church and wait. Except, until proven wrong, there is no afterlife and the priest, probably unwillingly, condemns them to a life of servitude.

The lowly priest isn't necessarily fueled by bad intentions. He tries to make them happy, to sooth, to reassure. That's why Marx and Engels (okay not anarchists I know) called religion the ""opium of the people"". It's like a drug the people give to themselves in order to forget the pain, the oppression, problems. Except that serves power, the authority, the state. They're less likely to revolt, to want to solve problems. Which is why I, personally, feel anarchism can't be compatible with religion.",1467331598

&gt;All this to say that I really hope we can keep OW a ***bastion*** of kindness and encouragement, but it'll take a ton of work.

As a Bastion main, I get hate every. single. game. Even before they've seen me play, even if I get 7:1+ kdr, even if I get POTG, or I'm the only one to get a card on the team, or I'm the only one to stand behind Rein, etc. It was fine until competitive. 

I would get some complains before yesterday, but it usually ended with apologies at the end, which felt nice... But, once competitive started it's been so bad that people will be typing so much hate at me that they don't even actually play, then they blame me for the loss. Someone will leave the game, and they will blame me.

Just yesterday I was encouraging a new player on this sub to keep playing and get better, and that the community was great so far. I hope he realizes that it's changed since my post to him.

It just sucks because I work from home, and I'm an extrovert, so I get most of my much needed social time through games and Reddit. I thought I finally had a game I could really excel at and have fun with. I need social interaction, and if all of it is negative it starts to chip away at me.

It's been such a bad time since competitive started that I don't want to play anymore. I do my best on Bastion. I've tried other heroes, but I'm just not nearly as good at them, and I don't have nearly as much fun, no matter how much I play and practice with them. 

Bastion is my favorite. His play style just works best with my brain. But because it's trendy to hate on him regardless of anything, I have to stick to vs AI, with the odd quickplay.

Selvom vi har været med i Irak osv. så er vi et mikro lille land, uden den store betydning for USA. De vil til enhver tid vælge Tyskland og Storbritannien fremfor Danmark. http://www.dr.dk/nyheder/indland/overvaagning-usa-pressede-danmark-til-mere-lempelige-krypteringsregler 

Endvidere er det er naivt at tro den danske elite er blødere og mindre magtbegæring end de andre Europæiske landes. Jeg stoler mere på Bruxelles hvor vi har medbestemmelse end jeg gør på DC. Hvis du burde være bange for nogen når det kommer til overvågninger er det NSA, ikke Europol.

Derudover er Tyskland notorisk tilhænger af privatliv og modstander af overvågning, så jeg giver ikke meget for det EU skræmmescenarie. Et Danmark udenfor EU og Europol ville have ligeså meget overvågning, tror endda det ville være værre.

"MakeupAddiction","t5_2rww2","Hello! Thank you for your nice comment! As someone who does not have a high pain tolerance, unless it's for beauty's sake, or tattoos in general, this was the least painful thing I've done. Mind you, I've never had my brows threaded because I heard it was more painful than waxing, so I can't compare it to that. 

You do get a numbing cream beforehand, which makes it almost painless. They let you sit with the cream on for a good 20 minutes to let it work its magic. Personally, I barely felt anything, except for the light vibration of the machine. The tails of my brows were a teensy bit uncomfortable, but nothing excruciating. If you've gotten a regular tattoo, it kind of felt like that towards the ends, only less intense. 

Directly after the procedure, my brows were naturally on the sore side, but it went away relatively quickly. I found that using a combination of aquaphor and some of the neosporin plus pain relief did a good job of keeping the minimal discomfort at bay. Overall, I found this to be the least painful thing I've done to myself, and that includes my tattoo collection and piercings LOL. Hope this helps!",1467331602

"GenderCritical","t5_2yk5v","The law has two concepts, *de jure* and *de facto*. The first means ""by law"" and the second means ""In fact"", so what is de jure isn't necessarily de facto, as the law makes a distinction between the two.

Legal statuses that are not biologically factual have existed for a long time and in matters unrelated to transgenderism.  One of these is that the husband of a woman is always legally the father of her child, whether or not he is so in fact. This law came about at a time when there was no reliable way to prove biological paternity.  Such laws have been held up even when the husband in question was nowhere near his wife to impregnate her at the proper time.

So, MtTs being designated ""female"" on certain legal paperwork doesn't mean that the law believes they are de facto female, but merely de jure, meaning that for the purposes of the law they are being treated *as if* they were female.  There is a difference.",1467331602

This was a slightly different concept used in China. If disaster or famine struck the country, this was seen as a sign from Heaven that the gods were unhappy with the Emperor. And if the gods were unhappy with the Emperor, he should be ousted and replaced by someone more virtuous.

So while similar, these two concepts have different agents of the divine will. ""Since he is our King, then *God has effected his will* to make him King, and rebellion would be sacrilege"" versus ""If the harvest is bad, that must mean that the Emperor lacks the Mandate, and *we must effect the will of Heaven* and topple him to get a good harvest again."" One was used to justify rebellion, the other to justify *not* rebelling.

This probably ties in nicely with the theological differences between the cultures, but unfortunately I know nothing of theology.

I do agree you should be able to join back in and Blizzard needs to work on making reconnections easier. Not everyone is on an i7 with OW on an SSD. 

I think it needs to be looked at. If you do suffer a disconnect you've really got no reason to come back since you'll be marked down as a loss anyway. I'm not sure how they'd do it. 

As it stands now, if a player disconnects. You'll now be playing 5v6 (unless that person rejoins, which has happened maybe 25% of the time in my personal experience.) If the match making is working as intended the match will more than likely be super close. You lose that person and it's now a lopsided fight.

No replacement is found and you're allowed to leave after 2 min but take a loss and no leaver mark. It seems... extremely rough around the edges.

I'd need a second full time job to pay for all of the gravel suspension and tires that I'd need.

There are a lot of things like physics and dynamics that go into moving suspension and steeeing. Yes loose component can cause vibrations while driving and/or braking. But not always both. A bad hub or axle could also cause this. An excessively bad hub will usually make noise or have a harsh vibration, and yes an on-car lathe will usually catch it. Literally the machine will not be able to compensate. 

A bad axle will, usually, only vibrate under accelerarion. Usually. Or while normally driving. Having an on car lathe in use can also show this, bc the whole front driveline will be moving while machining. You can usually spot this as the axles will have more of an elliptical rotation rather than a spherical one. I've only run into this a few times. 

If you want a good second opinion, I would take it to a shop you know well or trust. A 20 dollar inspection and test drive from an experienced technician can provide a lot of useful information. If you need the rotor machined expect to put out about another 100 bucks. Those machines are very precise and very expensive. Happy hunting ",1467331613

Opening his mouth to give into the assassin's request, the memory of *the* knight resurfaced reminding him of what he did.  He tried to push the memory out and opened his mouth once again to tell the assassin what she wanted to know, yet the memory came back.  Over and over again he tried to push it out of his mind, and over and over again it just kept coming back until he yelled sorrowfully to the memory in his mind, 'WHY!, WHY DID YOU TRUST ME!

"news","t5_2qh3l","&gt; The crimes are treated differently in CA. Turners victim was unconscious which the California penal code sees as a less serious offense than assault of a conscious person (like ramirezs victim). Make of it what you will but it isn't perskys fault that California tells him to punish ramirez more harshly.

The article quotes someone as saying that, but I don't think that's right. Rape is defined in [CPC 261](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=261-269) and sexual battery in [CPC 243.4](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=pen&amp;group=00001-01000&amp;file=240-248). For both crimes, the penalty is the same for an unconscious victim as other circumstances.

What is different is the crimes. Ramirez was convicted of rape, which carries a sentence of 3-8 years, so he got the minimum. It's not clear exactly which statutes Turner was convicted under, but it sounds like he got 1 count of attempted rape, which would be 1.5-4 years, and 2 counts of sexual battery, which would be 1-4 years each. So Turner's could have been anything from 1.5 to 12 years.",1467331617

"politics","t5_2cneq","I’m a 19 year old sophomore at Ohio State University, and I’m probably Bernie Sanders’s biggest backer. For the past year, I’ve spent at least two hours a day diligently upvoting every pro-Sanders post I could find on Reddit. I’ve been scouring unbiased news sites like Fox News, Breitbart and Russia Today to find articles that expose Hillary (or, as per my own delightful coinage, $HILLary) Clinton. And I’ve developed a keen eye for detecting electoral fraud, shockingly finding it perfectly correlated with whether or not Sanders lost a state.
But because the FBI is in Clinton’s pocket, sadly, the major party nominees will be her and Trump. And quite frankly, I can’t how see bad a Trump presidency could be for young white guys like myself who don’t have to worry about earning an income yet.
For instance, one of Trump’s most controversial proposals is a ban on Muslim immigration. To that I say: come on! Is that it? You don’t need to be a STEM major to work out how this shouldn’t be a burden for anyone. All you need to do to get around it is become an atheist!
Trump’s also made some allegedly misogynistic remarks, such as “Women, you have to treat them like shit”. While that may be a little “politically incorrect”, isn’t it true that women are attracted to assholes? I mean that’s the only reason I don’t have a girlfriend. I think it’d be refreshing to have a President who’s not afraid to tell it like it is about women.
And finally, some people are worried that Trump’s election could trigger a global economic downturn. Eh, I haven’t really read enough about this to be sure either way. But if it did happen, well, popcorn tastes good, right? I mean, it’s not as I have a job to lose or anything.
Now, this isn’t to say I love Trump. He’s not as strong as I’d like on the major civil liberty battles of our time, like legal weed or ethics in video game journalism. But sometimes you have to pick the lesser of two evils. And I must admit, the choice becomes easier when the people Trump could hurt the most aren’t like me.",1467331617

May I ask why?

&gt; because it doesn't do nothing, and it has in fact outperformed expectation. 

Is that because expectations were low to start with?

From the SMH article you linked, merely two paragraphs below ther quote you posted:

&gt; The numbers being bandied about, though, warrant closer examination.

&gt; For starters, the cut in emissions is not as big as it sounds. On average, the contracts signed by the government last for seven years. Broken down, that means a cut of just 6-7 million tonnes a year.

&gt; To put that into perspective using the most recent available data, Australia will need a cut of more than 40 million tonnes each year to reach the national target of a 5 per cent cut in emissions below 2000 levels by 2020.

And a bit further down:

&gt; This is the major difference between the repealed trading scheme and direct action – the former would have put a limit on emissions and could be scaled up over time, while the latter buys some cuts without yet guaranteeing that those cuts won't just be immediately wiped out by other companies increasing pollution.

So perhaps Direct Action does *something*, but does it do what it *should* be doing?",1467331621

Mini-splits have an indoor air handler (what you purchased) and an outdoor condensing unit.  There is a series of wires and pipes (lineset) that connect them together.  You'll need the outdoor unit, a *compatible* indoor air handler, lineset, and several other odds and ends to do this yourself (basic HVAC installation knowledge, vacuum pump, fittings, hole saw, just to name a few).

If you have a window in that room, a regular window-mount AC in the 6,000BTU range would probably work just fine, and way cheaper than a mini-split.  Window AC units are a lot more efficient than they used to be, and for such a small room, it wouldn't cost much to run it.

I'm a huge fan of mini-splits but they're not always the best choice for every scenario.

"learndota2","t5_2tta4","This is the only decent suggestion in this thread.

I've tried experimental matches testing exactly this concept: on average people tend to respond agressively/negatively in general to advice/commands/suggestions when they come from someone who they don't trust or don't know. I tried some time ago to call people out for being bad or making mistakes, trying to get them to fix said mistakes by acting differently and telling them how. Needless to say, it didn't work — things were already going badly for them and they didn't need more negativity (that's exactly how it's percieved).

In other games (most of them anyhow) when I help them kill a lot of guys in a row or (this one works best of all) I save them from certain death people listen and do exacly as I say even when it goes against what they were going to do (i.e. engaging an enemy when they are not sure we can succeed). [Results may vary](http://i.imgur.com/FwyPrsP.png).

I also have to add that if you're using mic due to the aspect that voice relays much more emotion than text ever can you also begin to affect the team's morale as well. A good clear command voice and a bit ([or a lot](https://youtu.be/AdfFnTt2UT0?t=187)) of positive reinforcement, especially when you put emotion into it can go a long way.

"Political_Revolution","t5_3ca4m","&gt;Who Asked For It? (TPP)

&gt;At this time it’s clear that the biggest trade agreement in US history will pass during the “lame duck” session of congress unless a ballot box revolt occurs on August 9th. Obama will sign it and we will be stuck with the deal forever, transferring more power to the corporations as they get even richer. We know which side they’re on.
 

&gt;Please ask your friends and neighbors if they contacted Ron Kind’s office and asked him to create this 6000 page monstrosity known as the TPP. Did any of the groups you or your friends belong to ask for this trade deal? Unless you have friends who are CEO’s of major corporations or the politicians they own, the answer is obvious. Kind is now arguing that the TPP will be good for milk sales, but the small farmer will not benefit. The CAFO’s, the large factory farms only interested in producing as much milk as they can regardless of the impact on the environment and who pit workers against each other, will. Whose side is Kind on?
 

&gt;Imagine the impact if “we the people” reject an 18 year incumbent and the chair of the “New Democrat” Coalition because of his unwavering support for a corporate giveaway! You could join me and thousands of my closest friends to stand on the capitol steps and demand a defeated Ron Kind respect the voters of the 3rd CD and reject the TPP. You know which side I’m on.

Why Buchholz is Running
http://buchholzforcongress.org/why-i-am-running/


Who is Myron against? A corporate sell out who pretends to be a progressive...sound familiar? He also backs Clinton
Here is what he said about Bernie.
In considering the field of presidential candidates, Kind said the Oval Office is no place for ""on-the-job-training.""

Ron Kind is the exact 1990's Corporate Democrat Bernie Sanders rails against and he went against his own word to back Clinton as a super delegate this year. He does not represent the district in Wisconsin well. He only wins because nobody challenged him to confront his votes for the Iraq War, TPP and supporting corporate power. That ends this year.

&gt;In a 2008 interview with the La Crosse Tribune, Kind said he’ll use his “superdelegate” vote to support whichever candidate gets the majority among 3rd Congressional District Democratic primary voters. “I’m going to keep faith with the voters and respect their choice,” said Kind.

&gt;Eight years later and Ron Kind has changed his tune. He continues to pledge his support for Hillary Clinton even though Bernie Sanders won the presidential primary in the 3rd Congressional district  by 61% to 39% over Hillary Clinton. That's unacceptable.

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","They would have to get the Yankees to agree to the Cyclones becoming their AAA team, which the Yankees would not do after the Mets stopped them from having their AAA team play in Newark while major work was done on their stadium.

The NYC MLB territory consists of the city proper, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland counties in NY, Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Union counties in NJ, and the portion of Fairfield County in Conn. that is south of I-84. The Yankees would have to approve of any minor league team being moved or promoted within that territory, or within 15 miles of that territory.

This is why putting a stadium in downtown Yonkers would have been really, really stupid, and why the LI Ducks and Rockland Boulders will never become associated minor league teams. The Hudson Valley Renegades, however, play not too far north of the territory line, and the Mets could associate them and turn them into their AA or AAA team without the Yankees permission.

Turning the Renegades into the AAA team probably would not work. I doubt any IL owner would be interested in moving their team there, and the stadium isn't big enough. However, the prior ownership group of the Bing Mets made it clear that they thought Bing is an A ball town, as they almost sold their team to a group in Ottawa with the plan to buy the Batavia Muckdogs. It think the move that should be made is turning the Bing Mets into the Rays' NY/Penn league team and turning the Renegades into the Mets' AA team.",1467331630

"pbsideachannel","t5_2vwc7","Are humans autonomous though? In the first years of a humans life they are almost entirely controlled by its creators (parents), and are only exposed to what the creators want it to be exposed to. Then over time it gets less and less controlled exposure, but still have involvement of the parents. If this at any time stops it is almost always substituted by some other person. Through almost all of our lives we continue to interact with other people, and stop working properly if that interaction stops for a long period of time.

&amp;nbsp;

So why would we expect a machine to be able to work without its creators if we don't give it any other chance of interaction with other people. If we took a human and raised it in an enclosed space just interacting with some parent figures and gave it some art while it was raised, would we really expect this person to produce art that was of the level of or with the qualities of what we want these machines to produce? If we gave this person unlimited access to google images, and let its human brain work on its own, would the art not still feel fairly 'agentive'? Would it not feel like the product of the people placing this person in this space? I think that the way to make the machine autonomous is not achieved by making machines that make machines etc. but instead by giving it so many 'creators' that we simply can not attribute how it works to one group of people. Sure, it will have a creator, just like humans have parents, but it will be a product of many people who are themselves independent of each other.",1467331631

"NewYorkMets","t5_2s7w9","They would have to get the Yankees to agree to the Cyclones becoming their AAA team, which the Yankees would not do after the Mets stopped them from having their AAA team play in Newark while major work was done on their stadium.

The NYC MLB territory consists of the city proper, Nassau, Westchester, Rockland counties in NY, Bergen, Hudson, Essex, and Union counties in NJ, and the portion of Fairfield County in Conn. that is south of I-84. The Yankees would have to approve of any minor league team being moved or promoted within that territory, or within 15 miles of that territory.

This is why putting a stadium in downtown Yonkers would have been really, really stupid, and why the LI Ducks and Rockland Boulders will never become associated minor league teams. The Hudson Valley Renegades, however, play not too far north of the territory line, and the Mets could associate them and turn them into their AA or AAA team without the Yankees permission.

Turning the Renegades into the AAA team probably would not work. I doubt any IL owner would be interested in moving their team there, and the stadium isn't big enough. However, the prior ownership group of the Bing Mets made it clear that they thought Bing is an A ball town, as they almost sold their team to a group in Ottawa with the plan to buy the Batavia Muckdogs. It think the move that should be made is turning the Bing Mets into the Rays' NY/Penn league team and turning the Renegades into the Mets' AA team.",1467331634

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","1600 might feel pretty low first because you're used to eating enough to maintain/gain at around 340.  If you dropped directly down to that with no transitioning, that can also complicated the problem.

Regarding your food being ""boring,"" the answer to that is slightly more in the ""tough shit"" category.  You don't get to wolf down entire pizzas anymore.  Not if you want results.  Have a slice of pizza.  Have two.  Have them with a salad and call that dinner, all carefully calculated within calorie limit.  

If you want to have success in this area, you have to learn to tell yourself no.  It's like a credit card.  To get to 340, you made a lot of bad decisions with food, and it's not all because of the anxiety.  That's like running up a huge balance on that credit card.  You had your fun in advance and didn't worry about the consequences, and now the creditors are calling you and calling you to collect, and you can't just keep spending.  You have to pay them, and you have to pay them back in good decisions.

This is the part of the process where you learn about the very, very strong connection between your behaviors and their consequences, because you can't break that connection.  It's always there, whether you want it or not, whether it feels good or not, or whether your food is entertaining or not.

Basically, encumbrance 1 or less items can be concealed relatively easily. No roll is required to hide the gear unless the character is being actively inspected up close ( like a physical pat-down ).

The rules are that for every encumbrance value over 1 ( or, for a large creature, maybe 2 ... or a small creature, maybe 0 ) ... the searching party gets a boost die in their search. The roll is Perception (searching party) vs Stealth (hiding party).

Further ... there is ample room for GM judgement. For example, hiding a blaster rifle ( encumbrance 4 ) on the person of a human-sized individual is going to be rather difficult. Just common sense.",1467331634

It suggests paying off the debt first (especially if its credit card debt) as, in an emergency, you can usually just re-borrow and be in the same position as you started in. Whereas if you don't experience an emergency then you're better off for not having to pay back a large chunk of interest.

"AskEconomics","t5_2selg","&gt;""*In my opinion*, rather than try to get immigration down (at least, if we are only considering economics), attempt to increase the mobility of your labour force - retraining programmes, make it easier to relocate, that kind of thing. In particular watch out for when a whole town that relies on one industry is hit with competition at the same time. Those places can become desolated for generations if you are not careful.""

Labour mobility cannot and never will be possible in all circumstances, these dead and poor towns and cities will not vanish off the face of the Earth. Most Western economies have areas that have lost jobs to foreign competition and consequently, these areas are almost always the poorest areas in that said country. People do move away, populations are normally falling in these places, but that's the problem, not the solution.

What happens is you have people that succeed in education or retraining moving away to places with lower unemployment and higher wages usually in the same country, meaning the money spent on education programs just becomes a subsidy to improve the wealthier parts of the country's labour force.

What you need is policies to encourage businesses and skilled workers to move there and want to stay there in the first place. What's instead happening is low-skilled immigrants are being drawn to these places (which have the lowest house prices and cheapest cost of living) which causes resentment and even higher unemployment and lower wages when no businesses want to move there because the labour force skillset is so bad, that's certainly not helping.

What should be done, I think, is to stop low-skill immigration until these places get even close to full employment (which they are a long, long way from now) and make them special 'economic zones' where the government would give tax breaks to any business that operates or invests there, say, and put more money into local infrastructure.",1467331641

I understand why you would want level limited zones, because then douchebags who pk with ice barrage can't just show up and kill for fun even if they get nothing out of it - but bear in mind there are a lot of players who exclusively hunt skullers, and a low risk zone would be beneficial to these players, so it should counteract the issue; especially if boxing is fixed.",1467331647

I figured it out on my own last week but never realized there was any actual guides for adjusting them properly, it was just like ""hey if I loosen this maybe they can rotate"" and it worked. 

Now if I could only consistently remember how trigger shifters work... I spend so much more time on my road bike that I can't develop any muscle memory for the flat bar bike. ",1467331648

Well, yes, that is the point of the FSM, to mock beliefs in the supernatural, and to parody them. And it tries to draw parallels with the absurdity of itself.

I set mine to the (74) setting to match my monitor refresh rate. Another thing to check is your temperatures. If you're only using a 60 hz monitor, no point in running extreme fps like 100+ anyways since you won't see all of the extra frames. When I turn off vsync, my fps drops a bit every once in a while due to throttling as it hits my throttle temps due to the extra frames being generated.

Not having to worry about building crit chance means you can roll the muzzle and magazine to crit damage and get close to an extra 80% CHD just from those two pieces...  plus CHD on kneepads, gloves, and (maybe) pack, with 20% each from HF and DE, and ~27% from Deadly... you're looking at over 200% crit damage before Pulse.

Take the classic use of ""uhh"": when you're asked by the server what you're ordering and blank out. The ""uh"" means ""I'm about to speak, don't count me out yet,"" whereas simply remaining silent could mean anything at all, including that the person isn't going to speak or didn't hear their prompt.

I think they even have a designated build for you to look at stat-wise. It's good about staying up to date and goes over a lot more than I can in a single post.

2) A person who goes by TRB has a [power leveling/farming guide](http://www.trb1965.com/trb1965/plm.php). It's written with a mage in mind, although those spots are still generally the best farming spots around. You can also check the AQ guides on the forums for more.

3)Red means it's a guardian item, blue means it's a z-token item

4) Retro twilly is a viable healing pet, but for an annihilator beast-warrior I would expect most often you would want to use a pet that deals damage. It mostly comes down to your personal preference though,

5) FO and FD are two of the armor leans. There are five in total:

Full Offense (FO): Your weapons deal 125% damage, but you take 125% damage.

Mid Offense (MO): Your weapons deal 112.5% damage and you take 112.5% damage.

Neutral (N): The standard, you deal and take 100% damage.

Mid Defense (MD): For these it's 90% damage.

Full Defense (FD): For these it's 80% damage.

These leans do not affect spell damage or weapon specials, only normal attacks and the damage you take. Most people either go FO or FD, and warriors almost exclusively go FO. Defensive armors are mostly for mages who focus on casting spells and people who use 100% proc weapons. As an annihilator warrior you almost definitely want full offense armors.",1467331657

And everyone ITT using the logic of ""Catelyn's a dumbass that's why he didn't tell her"" aren't proving anything either.  If Ned had been able to think that many steps ahead knowing that all his sons were basically going to die he wouldn't have let Jon go join the Night's Watch.  You think Jon Snow joining the Night's Watch and becoming King of the North was a logical career path?  Hell no.  

People saying it was to protect Jon.  If it was after Robert's death then no.  Robert ordered the murder of Daenarys.  Joffrey ordered for the deaths of Robert's bastards.  What was Ned going to do?  Claim that Jon was the rightful heir to the throne because of his half lineage to the Targaryens?  No one would believe him at that point anyways.

"EnoughTrumpSpam","t5_39usd","I actually posted it on a forum.  Someone asked me for a top 10 list of reasons I didn't support Trump; I ended up with more then 30.  I didn't originally have links on mine, but I can find some if you want.  This is also a little old, he's done a lot of bad things since this.

Top reasons Trump must not become president:

Trade

1. Trump wants to start a trade war with China. The US-China trade relationship is really the cornerstone of the entire global economy, and this would pretty much be guaranteed to start a worldwide economic recession all on it's own, even before taking into account the rest of this list.

2. His insane ""build a wall and make Mexico pay for it"" plan sounds like it would also involve massive trade sanctions against Mexico when they (obviously) refuse to pay for ""that fucking wall"", to quote the former president of Mexico. So now we're starting a trade war against China and Mexico at the same time. (And of course this is also going to massively piss off pretty much the entire rest of the world; see below).

3. He also sounds like he wants to get rid of NAFTA, wants to start a trade war with Japan, wants to sanction Saudi Arabia unless they agree to send tens of thousands of soldiers into Syria or something (if we're already sanctioning Mexico, where we're getting a lot of our oil from now, I can't imagine sanctioning Saudi Arabia at the same time is a good idea.) He pretty much doesn't want to trade with anyone. He was even talking about sanctioning individual American companies who have factories oversees, which makes no sense at all.

So basically, we're just on trade policy, and already Trump is pretty much 100% guaranteed to start a deep worldwide depression much worse then the one we had in 2008, to totally destroy the US both economically and financially and in terms of our global reputation, and to leave us isolated, weak, and globally hated.

Then you get to foreign policy, and it gets even worse.

*4* Trump wants to basically dissolve NATO, which would pretty much give Russia free reign to invade countreis in Eastern Europe

*5*. At the same time he's making us weaker and Russia stronger, he also wants to start a war with Russia over Ukraine, I think, although he also likes Putin, I think. He has tried to have it both ways here.

*6*. He wants to invade Syria and take their oil. Syria doesn't have oil.

*7*. He also seems to want to piss off pretty much every ally we might have after he does the above, from Japan to Canada to Israel.

*8*. And his anti-Islamic discrimination and blatant hatred of Muslims make it impossible for us to actually get any benifit from, say, cutting ties with Israel, and really make it impossible for any Islamic nations to work with us at all, so there goes the rest of our allies.

Basically, combined with the first 3 points, his policy would totally undermine the US in the world and leave us weak and crippled while driving away pretty much every single ally we have. Even things one otherwise might agree with (say, pulling away from Israel) just hurt us even more with no benifits when combined with the other things he's promising to do. If his goal was to ruin us utterly in every way, that would be a good plan. He would singlehandedly ruin the US's relationship with Europe, Mexico, China, Japan, the whole middle east, Canada, South America, Pakistan, and really everyone else. And that's just based on the stuff he's actually *proposed*; when you add in his hotheaded impulsive nature it gets really ugly.

Then you get into Trump's fascist tendencies:

*8*. He's a right-wing demagogue who scapegoats racial, ethnic, and religious minorities to get support for extremist immigration policies

*9*. Talks about how impressed he is with authoritarian leaders like Kim Jung Un and Putin for the way that they ruthlessly seized power, took total control, and killed anyone who got in their way (including both journalists and family members)

*10*. Is willing to use street violence to advance his cause (both in his speeches, and his offer to ""pay the legal bills"" of the man who attacked someone at one of his rallies, and in his hints that maybe his supporters would riot at the RNC, and even his campaign manager is being charged with assault and battery for physically attacking a reporter)

*11*. Uses non-stop hypernationalist rhetoric, talks about how only he can return the fatherland to greatness

*12*. Uses the specter of enemies both at home and abroad to manipulate people, uses xenophobia and the fear of outsiders to manipulate people

*13*. Constantly uses fascist symbols and references, both intentionally and accidentally (quote Mussolini, used Nazi soldiers in a campaign ad, ""everyone raise your right hand and pledge a loyalty oath"", ect)

*14*. Seems to put ""strength"" and ""winning"" over all else, doesn't seem to have any respect for rule of law or the constitution, or any conception that the powers of the President are in any way limited

*15*. Is against freedom of the press. He wants to expand libel laws dramatically to make it easier for public figures (like him) to sue and shut down negitive comments about them. And at his rallies, he often gets the crowd so riled up against the press that reporters there literally fear for their safety.

Trump is quite literally running on a fascist platform. It's not clear if it's just far-right populism gone to extremes and done in a clumsy way or if Trump is literally planning on making himself president for life and abolishing the Republic; at this point, neither would surprise me.

This is of course tied with his long history of racism:

*16*. Started the campaign by trying to play off of racist fears of Hispanics to drive support for his extreme immigration policy

*17*. Posted racist misinformation about the crime statistics of black Americans that was originally created by a neo-nazi

*18*. Used a racist Asian accent while talking about china

*19*.Make anti-Semetic jokes while standing in front of a group of Jewish Republicans

*20*. Pretended he didn't know who David Duke and the KKK was on television so he didn't have to denounce them, even though he certanly did know who David Duke was. (He later retracted this, but IMHO it was only because he didn't get away with it.)

*21*. Made sweeping generalizations about Muslims

*22*. Has re-tweated white supremacists multiple times. One twitter user with the handle ""WhiteGenocideTM"" was re-tweated by Trump two separate times

*23*. He also has a pretty iffy history with race even before the campaign. For example, the whole ""birther"" thing he tried to do to Obama was pretty racist, and several decades ago while running his real estate company he was actually sued by the Department of Justice for racially discriminating against black people in terms of who he was renting apartments to, and had to settle out of court..

I know I'm at more then 20 already, but I can't stop here:

Because now you get to to his economic policy:

*24*. His health care policy is basically just ""repeal Obamacare"" which would case millions to lose insurance

*25*. And his tax plan is to cut taxes for the rich in a way that would cost trillions of dollars with no clear way to pay for it.

So at the same time he's pissed off the rest of the world and driven us into a depression, he would also bankrupt our country with economic policy. Which normally would be something we could maybe survive, but somehow I don't think China or Europe is going to be buying a lot of US bonds suddenly. This category is thin only because he's said so little about his economic policy, but what he has said has been terrible.

*26*. He's also a climate change denier, and frankly it's crazy that this fact is this far down the list. He actually said that ""The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive"".

Then you get to his immigration policy, which is basically:

*27*. Round up and deport 12 million people somehow (which, frankly, would have to involve massive internment camps)

*28*. Did I mention that Trump literally said that he might have been in favor of Japanese internment camps during WWII? Wasn't sure if I should put that here or under fascism.

http://time.com/4140050/donald-trump-mu ... nternment/

*29*. Block all Muslims from entering the US, which is both unconstitutional and horrific

*30.* ""Build a wall"", which is just a massive waste of money and would accomplish nothing.

Even attempting to do these kinds of things would do still more damage to the American economy and to American freedoms, especially when combined with the above. They also wouldn't actually work.


Now I'm in the 30's, and I haven't even gotten to the fact that

*31.* He seems to have zero understanding of complex issues,

*32*. no relevant experience,

*33*. none of the skills needed to be president,

*34*. and he thinks he's skilled at foreign negotiations because he sold apartments to some guys from China.

*35*. And when asked who his foreign policy advisor is, he literally said himself.

*36*. And he wants to nominate his sister to the supreme court.

"ThatSnobEmpire","t5_3elcm","&gt; because we can't see light doesn't mean it's not there or anything we just can't see it, we can still measure it and detect it, so what does this even mean?

Measurement is a form of perception. Just look at optical illusions. We measure something based on how big/long/etc. we *see* it to be. Measurement is a code, a language we devise, a form of communicating what we perceived. It is subjective. What we measure exists objectively, but *how* we measure and measurement itself is a subjective practice.

&gt; using the literary definition of art buildings are art , how do you judge a building as structurally sound?

There's a massive difference between aesthetic and function. Architecture's 'art' is in making something beautiful that stays standing. The latter part is more about science and physics and whatnot, but that doesn't make the whole process 'objective' nor seeing the process or its result 'objective'. In the same way narratology can be put down to a science but remains to prove that the reader is a fundamental co-creator of the final product. What we find as 'objective' through science only continues to prove the subjectivity of our perception.

&gt; so if someone shoots down an orphanage cause his religion says so , is that also subjective?

Yes, obviously. The fact it happened is a fact, but the person's belief that they're 'doing the right thing' is obviously based on perception and not on facts external from perception.

&gt; your saying people judge objectively good cause everyone else said it was good , and that is still false

It's his experience, and mine too. Ad populum gets everywhere.

&gt; omeone who says x show is good cause he enjoyed it and another guy saying the story was executed with few plot holes, which opinions have more merit.

This is correct, but I don't believe Digi is actually, at any point, riding on this 'fallacy' of '100% subjective'. Having seen his other content, there's no way he believes that. He puts his videos online because he wants to argue for his opinions, because he puts more value and weight into them by making his Thesis on K-On and whatnot.

When he says 'none of [things he said before] means it's good', he's referring to how people take certain techniques as 'objectively good' and take a firm stance on 'because writer did this, it's objectively a better show'. He's not arguing for the 'all opinions are equal' thing; you're projecting some frustration you have about that onto him.

It's not. Actually, it's most definitely not, it's not even remotely close to a medium-tier or medium-sized sport. The reason it got the recognition it did is because it was part of the Olympics, and Phelps not only did very, very well there, but did phenomenally, ridiculously well in a single visit/year. 

I have no clue whether he has doped either, but I would say there's a reasonable chance he hasn't *because* of how small and unpopular the sport is, both in America and the rest of the world. Since the sport and competition is so relatively small, him having those freak attributes (according to the guy you responded to) mean even more when his competition is much, much weaker than it potentially could be. I would strongly, strongly argue that is an additional reason he has dominated as he has. 

Contrast his situation to Usain Bolt, who was able to do what he did in a sport that has been around for ages; not only do more people run than swim (that's an assumption as I don't have hard data, but I think a pretty reasonable one), but people have likely been competitively running for eons - definitely not the case with competitive swimming, especially since the facilities to do so are not even remotely as widespread around the globe.

"gay","t5_2qhef","As Barefoot already said, sexuality can be fluid and complex - so there's no need to say definitively that you're either gay, straight, or bi. 

On a personal note, I can sympathize with being confused about who and what you're attracted to. What helped me was realizing that many different types of attraction can exist. For example, I consider my best friend (who is female-bodied) to be one of the most beautiful people I have ever met - her hair, her fashion sense, her scars, everything about her. However, I have no interest in sleeping with her. I've only ever been sexually attracted to men, but I am very aesthetically attracted to my friend - the two are not necessarily the same, though they can overlap. And that's fine and perfectly normal - society is the one that teaches us to think that appreciating the beauty of a human body must mean sexual attraction is at play, and thus straight men should never appreciate the looks of other men, and appreciating a woman's body is inherently a sexual act, etc. 

Learning about the difference between aesthetic and sexual attraction helped me to realize that I wasn't bisexual like I had previously believed, but rather that I was a gay man who simply found some women aesthetically pleasing. Perhaps this is the same for you - but maybe your feelings are different. Feelings can also change.

I'll end this by saying that regardless of how you ultimately end up feeling about your sexual orientation, you should probably talk about it with your girlfriend. In all relationships, romantic and otherwise, clear communication is key. Perhaps you'll decide to stay together. Perhaps you'll decide to remain friends but seek different sexual partners. No matter what happens, though, please try to talk about it. And if you need more support, please feel free to message me any time. :-)",1467331667

"Overwatch","t5_2u5kl","As much as I generally like the community of this sub aside from it's natural echo-chamber/circlejerk attitude thats inherent to reddit, I firmly believe that there is no way of completely stopping asshats of being toxic in the ingame chat.

And I also believe that the current low level of toxicity is by design of the game. I don't believe that the toxicity is a thing that a community of people really does not get to decide themselves. 

Just look at DotA2 or League. They both have overly drawn out games of 10 minutes of nearly no action and up to 45-60 minutes of frustration when you lose. The experience of not being in control over the outcome of such a long match is not often a pleasant one if you are on the receiving end.

CoD is just a self-indulging, egocentric game by nature. Aside from professional play its all about them kills and the corellation between K/D-ratio and epeen length.

SC2 can be highly tilting/frustating because you friggin **know** you are shit at the game. Heck everyone besides Flash is/was. Every loss is because you earned it. There very rarely is a time when you couldn't have done something to stop the strategy of you enemy.

Then we have Overwatch. Matches are short. Action is frantic. basically little to no time to snark in chat. Statistics of other players are hidden to you. (Which apparently does not prevent all the shit talking, but it helps.) Yes its also a Teamgame and you aren't always in control whether you lose or win, but the games are finished in 15 minutes.

i'm dying to know why people say this. what makes you think that the showrunners had it out for this fictional character?

why do you think this weird, emotionally driven reason was why stannis was cut out of the show? they're making a show. they have actors with contracts and salaries. a budget to hit. a finite number of locations they can travel to and number of sets they can build, costumes they can design and manufacture.

i don't like what happened to mannis but i understand that they wanted to roll his story of rallying the north to defeat the boltons into jon snow's plot so their contractual obligations of minimum screentime for kit harrington could be met, and budget could be saved. this is the same reason they melded jeyne/alys into sansa last season. they can't leave sophie turner, a starring cast member, with nothing to do but build snow castles for a season- for both dramatic and monetary reasons.

that is unfortunately the reality of filming a television series.

let's say nothing of the fact that grrm confirmed that [mannis burns his daughter in the books too](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/2016/03/14/game-of-thrones-george-rr-martin-always-intended-for-shireen-to0/). you really need to take your blinders off man. we're in uncharted territory now but grrm plotted the course for the show runners.",1467331670

Have yet to field them, and that may have to wait for a couple weeks due to a slight disaster going on at my home (flooding what a joy...). Anyways, on to the actually review!  

The set I ordered is just the basic goggles in black with a clear lens. The strap is soft and very elastic so one will have no problem getting it to fit their head with great comfort. A great feature about the straps is the [quick detach velcro](http://i.imgur.com/lKzOj4z.jpg), which makes getting the goggles off very easy if you need to. The part that makes contact with your face is a stiff rubber material that doesn't really bend that much but will create that full seal protection you need. The biggest feature on these goggles is how they're ventilated. [The lens is an entirely separate piece from the frame.](http://i.imgur.com/2R28MpF.jpg) Both on the bottom and the top there is a gap which should HOPEFULLY put my fogging issues to an end. Out of the box, these goggles come with pieces covering those gaps but they are very easy to remove and put back on when needed.

The one gripe I have with these goggles is that they are not meant for an asian face (surprise surprise, I'm asian!) and don't exactlly fit well with a flatter face profile. I did manage to get it to sit flat against my face but I needed to have them bend slightly outwards. [I achieved that by running the straps over my howard leight headset (horray for tactical gear selfies).](http://i.imgur.com/3iad9GM.jpg)

Anyways, I'm a fan of these goggles and I had to order these from an ebay seller in France to get these here in Canada at a reasonable price (below $100 CAD for the base plain set). Pretty sure you who are located in the US or the UK can have an easier time getting these things than me. Hope to test them out soon!

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","&gt; The price of medicine, health care, insurance, banking, tuition, housing, etc. has risen quite ridiculously, while they pay for the same amount of work has not (and the expected workload has increased).

It's called elastic and inelastic goods. Elastic goods like TV's and oranges can have prices that fluctuate based on many things. They are generally very cheap right now because of modern manufacturing, automation and wage stagnation.

Inelastic goods are more narrow (housing and healthcare) and with a fiat currency, they tend to march upward predictably. These are the goods that take home pay can be measured against to make good conclusions about the general health of labor compensation.

If wages were to rise dramatically to meet the costs of inelastic goods, in all likelihood the general cost of elastic goods would have to rise to accommodate the newly released demand and higher general compensation. A strong argument can be made in the realm of elastic goods that it might be a wash for consumers who are making more but now paying more, so why should we bother? (though there is stronger evidence that it is a net win for consumers)

Where everyone wins (except for the mega-rich who would have less bargaining power over their employees) is in the inelastic sectors where wages have managed (more or less) chained to the predictable costs. ie: the price of building a house won't go up if McDonalds workers are making $20/hr and an accomplished surgeon making $150k/yr makes enough that he won't get a bump from the low wage sectors.",1467331672

Guns are bad/war on guns/prison population skyrockets/prisons overcrowded

He points at someone in the crowd striding purposefully towards you in a trenchcoat. He has bags under his eyes, and seems to be bleeding from both them and his mouth. 

You hear Cade shout from the top floor: [*""Cerxes, get out of there!""*](/ac) 

You hear a suppressed gunshot from the top floor of the club. 

It hits the guy in the leg. Upon falling to the ground, he decides he's close enough, and detonates a bomb vest concealed beneath the trench coat. 

You take plotd1 damage and briefly black out. 

When you wake up, Cade is dragging you out of the nightclub. People are screaming. You can hear further gunfire. 

[*""They figured him out.""*](/ac) you can hear Cade shouting distantly over the tinnitus. You're pretty sure you feel blood trickling down your ears. 

[*""They also sent backup. Can't tell if it's you or TP they're after.""*](/ac) 

He gently sets you down to suppress a few targets. He appears to have a fresh magazine in his left hand, and is able to swap between them very quickly. 

[*""I made the wrong call!""*](/ac) he says, picking you up, this time putting you in a fire man's carry and drawing a pistol. [*""I should have domed that guy, but I didn't think... Ah, shit, I'm sorry Cerxes.""*](/ac)

Hey there, your submission was removed from /r/listentothis because your account does not yet meet our minimum karma requirements to post links. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just listen and enjoy the music. Please read this entire reply because we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette) and [the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq). Next, read the [listentothis introduction](/r/listentothis/wiki/reddiquette) to learn how the sub operates. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment but not submit music to listentothis. Earning downvotes will block your comments, so comment wisely. New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit music links in listentothis. We can't divulge this score, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you are planning to submit your own music or the music of someone with whom you have a personal association** (e.g. friend, neighbor, colleague, etc.), you may do so [only as a comment in our weekly Melting Pot thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/search?q=self%3Ayes+%22melting+pot%22+-flair%3Amodpost&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week) after your account is at least one day old. Additionally, we recommend reading the [guidelines for self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) as violating these rules can result in a site-wide shadowban - that's simply the way reddit operates and is outside of our control.

"gameofthrones","t5_2rjz2","You're still basing his inability to command using a single instance where he was baited and fell for a trap based on his whole reason for fighting. I think that is an unfair way to conclude his abilities. Especially since Jon seems to have had similar, if not the same training Robb received. He simply found himself in a situation Robb never encountered.

Ok i think I see what you mean about his position and BotB a bit better. And can agree with you there.

You're right we don't know that the NK will not try to manipulate people for his own ends. But he has never done this. With Bran I would argue it was a lucky opportunity that he took advantage of rather than him manipulating bran. He did not trick him into ""logging in"" without BR's help, Bran made that mistake all on his own.

As for his initial strategy being faulty, you make it seem like there was a better more viable strategy readily available. Which I fail to see. Jon made a strategy with what he had, accounting for being flanked by cavalry and attempting a Cannae imitation. Ramsay outnumbered him by almost 3-1, they were more disciplined, were better equipped, had much more cavalry, supplies and a stronghold to fall back to. They had every single possible  advantage in that fight. There are simply some situations where a gifted commander will not win with the cards they are given.

As for your kings analogy I can agree with almost all of it. With the exception of Dany's personal gain. Everything else you've said is pretty good. And those characters do follow her for those reasons. However her campaign is based entirely on it being hers. It is for her own gain.

I think the meta analysis is dubious at best anyway because they acknowledge these experimental shortcomings and seem to try to account for them somehow, but still compute aggregate statistics from them and present them as something substantial. Their method for doing so seems really sound (and well documented), but I think these methods are better served at analyzing different analyses that are assumed to be valid.

The three real pitches the Warriors can make to KD are: 1) Rings. The team would be the favorite for the next 3-5 years to win with the team's crazy offensive and defensive abilities. 2) Offensive flow.

Just find heroes you have a fairly large amount of games on that also have a high winrate and spam those heroes.

Also your SF build is not that great and you're not adapting.

Treads-shadow blade - aghs - BKB - manta/S&amp;Y every game is not good. In some games it's good, but not every game.

You actually have very little rightclick DPS with that build, you have an ulti and once you use that ... then you're useless.

Aghs gives a tiny bit of DPS, BKB gives basically none, shadow blade gives some attack speed and manta/S&amp;Y are decent.

Think about items like: butterfly, blink, deso, skadi, daedalus, MKB, AC.

Also the main problem you seem to have is WHEN TO FARM vs WHEN TO FIGHT.

You have games where you get ""ok"" cs and very few kills vs terrible cs and lots of kills.

Our fast-moving GPS satellites in high orbit over the earth need to be corrected for differences between their clocks and our eathbound clocks.  The daily average correction is about [38 microseconds](http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html).   

If we added that up for the 27,275 day lifetime average that Google tells me.. (nearly an exact 75 years).. we get 

27 375 * 38 microseconds = 1.04025 seconds  

Our GPS satellites travel at about 14,000 km/hour, or 1/77,000th the speed of light. 

So, yes.. your life might be extended, but only a really tiny bit. 
Traveling through other areas of space with more pronounced curvatures,  or getting closer to the speed of light might increase that -- but nobody on Earth would be able to share that with you.

MBTI in general isn't something that's a competition, or who can get a higher score on what, it just is. I personally don't think people should put so much emphasis on their own type or some other type to a point where they'd totally rather be something/someone else, or to a point where they (as I have seen some people in the MBTI community do) glorify themselves; I think it might get unhealthy. While there's nothing wrong in general with wanting to change yourself for the better physically or mentally  (developing healthier cognitive habits, stuff like that) when it gets to a point where you don't want yourself at all, it'll likely become unhealthy even if it's a slow process.

There are many selfish and careless things I've done in which I was totally aware of my error before and while doing it. Do you seriously think everyone who abuses the planet or their fellow human beings does so merely out of ignorance? 

This is the purpose of the ritualized training and the mystical elements of religion. Socially, we evolved in such a way that our conceptualization of the universe requires augmentation with some sort of guiding narrative that can lend identity and purpose. Without this narrative, we have no reason to concern ourselves with anything other than the measured self-destruction of an epicurean lifestyle. Without a grander framework, we need only to justify those things which most efficiently benefit us for the duration of our lifetime. In the instance of something like climate change, wealthy men without an augmented moral compass have no reason to concern themselves as long as it doesn't impact their comfort in the next fifty years or so. The world can literally burn for all they care as long as the suffering takes place after they are dead.",1467331691

Their descendants were still citizens centuries later, and retained all the rights of citizens. Voting had to be done in person though, and in Rome.

Focusing in passage makes you easily step on AAMC's traps too. I strongly recommend to read EK's CARS. TPRH is helpful with their solid passages, but it would be helpful to know many different ways of approaching the problem. (Even if it's not your style and you won't use it.) Also, as long as you know what the author is arguing about, you don't need to know the details too much. Details are not too important and the real MCAT is not kind enough to tell you where the word is, such as saying ""line 27~28"" other study materials are talking about.",1467331697

If you can stretch your buget to this, you'll be very pleased. I just added another stick of your RAM, since it's already somewhat fast for DDR3. I replaced the 970 by a 1070, it will be much better and give you the choice to upgrade your monitor(to 1440p) and still have buttery smooth FPS. I got a bit cheaper SSD but just as good ! I also added wattage wattage on the PSU for upgradability, future-proofing(you will be able to reuse it in future builds) purposes.  
I don't think the 1060 will be better than the RX480. And it isn't near it's realease. I think it's safe to go for the GTX1070 anyway.",1467331699

I know that Israel controls Palestiine. They can do whatever they want. They can kill all Palestinian first borns tomorrow if they want. Just because they can do something doesnt mean that we shouldnt object. 


&gt; That doesn't change the fact that Israel is going to give up some settlements in an eventual peace deal. They have already offered to do so several times.

The Palestinians have agreed to 4% land swaps. What do you think of that? Thats 70% of the settlers who can stay where they are. Why will Israel not agree to this? 

&gt; Who cares why they pulled out. They handed over the keys to the kingdom and in return the Palestinians elected Hamas, a terrorist organization to lead them...who then proceeded to fire over 13,500 rockets aimlessly into Israel.

They didnt 'elect hamas to lead them'. Hamas won the majority of seats in the legislature, not the presidency. The only way that they were able to take over Gaza is through a military coup, which they were able to accomplish because Israel had  demilitarized the Palestinian Authority  and removed all its forces. In a final deal the PA has proposed having international forces present so that Palestine can be stable even if Israel insists  upon demilitarizing the PA. 


&gt; You are seriously mistaken if you think Israel needs to ask the PA for permission to build in the West Bank. It is the Palestinians demanding Israel cease construction or they won't come to the table.

The entirety of the human race outside of israel disagrees and says that israeli settlements are 100% illegal. Every single inch of land that israel has built on has been illegally seized. Israel is violating international law every single day that it pushes settlements further. Palestine is the one in the right here. Israel has no right to demand that they be allowed to expand settlements during negotiations. 





&gt; The status quo for the last 50 years has been Israeli control over the West Bank. They have no responsibility to make a concession to a neighbor before any real talks begin.

Again, the Palestinians arent asking for a single inch of land. They arent asking for any concessions. Only Israel is asking for concessions. They are asking that Palestine concede unlimited territory to Israel during the negotiations. 



&gt; Israel has offered to give up settlements in several peace deals and do land swaps for the settlements far too large to give up. Settlements only make up 4% of the land in the WB....any thought that they are a sign of Israels desire to annex the West Bank or not talk peace is laughable. 

The PA has agreed to a 4% land swap. Israel has not. How  does this information fit into your world view?



&gt; The bigger question is whether the future Palestinian state would accept Jewish settlers as citizens if they lived on land that would become Palestinian and didn't want to move. Israel has a twenty percent Arab population...could a a Palestinian state accept having Jewish citizens?

Yes, the PA has repeatedly said that Jews would be free to immigrate to Palestine if there is a peace deal. The only thing they oppose is illegal israeli settlements which take territory from Palestine. They are happy with Jewish immigrants so long as the territory remains Palestinian.

*Queue Sir Mixalot's ""Baby Got Back""*

You like big butts you say?! Well check out none other than [[Doran, the Siege Tower]] the king of fat, big, round, voluptuous, juicy butts in all of magic!! Not only do you bring out the defense, but they swing those big juicy thangs around and start woppen creatures, planeswalkers, and players right in there tiny face!

If you got missles incoming, just have them throw that booty around and start twerkin, those missiles or blades will start bouncing off due to the impenetrable and mighty booty that is part of the Doran Big Booty Judy Clan.

That's not all no siry! Say you're going up against some big 'ol football players who can take out a defense or two, all you gotta do is throw down a couple anthems such as [[Castle]], or a creature like [[Oathsworn Giant]], and for a little bit of extra fun throw down the wonderous [[Meekstone]]. That Stone'll take care of any offensive linemen trying to take out your De-booty-fense.

So if you want some true abzan might, pick Doran, the Siege Tower for the power of booty, the power of booty, and even more power of the booty. Thank you and that is all

"RpRoomFBB","t5_3962h","**Log Joke vs. Pro:** Log Joke has the experience, the speed advantage, and probably a better wedge. This will be a tough fight, but I think Playzooki's bot has the advantage.

**Vertigo 2 vs. Dock Leaf:** Dock Leaf is the fastest robot in Pressure Drop, capable of speeds of over 30 MPH. Unfortunately, even with the 4WD drivetrain that much speed will make the bot very difficult to control (12 speed vs. 8 traction lol). The wedges are decently durable, but I'm not confident they can get under Vertigo's skirts, and quite honestly the robot shows an appalling lack of durability. This will most likely be Dock Leaf driving around but not really doing much until Vertigo manages to get a hit in or Dock Leaf manages to KO itself by smashing into an arena hazard.

**Channel One II vs. Popo's Corkscrew:**  C12 is pretty quick for a spinner, but the wedged front corners don't actually scrape the floor, and the drum doesn't have much power behind it. Popo is faster and has omni drive, and is tough enough that it will take minimal damage from C12's weapon. This fight will most likely involve a lot of flipping and pushing from Popo.

**Powerdrive II vs. Scarab:** This one is actually going to be interesting. Scarab's drum is, unusually, powered by a pneumatic motor. It's not actually that powerful compared to the electric spinners, but a solid hit should still eviscerate the weakly-armored Powerdrive. However, using the drum burns through the robot's supply of compressed gas incredibly quickly, and if Scarab's driver isn't careful it could end up unable to use either of its weapons. Powerdrive can do serious damage to Scarab if it gets a side hit, but the drum won't be able to bit into the flipper very well. A flip from Scarab could actually be pretty destructive itself from the impact of tossing Powerdrive 8 feet in the air. However, Powerdrive does have the speed advantage. I'm picking Scarab, but this will depend on driving.

**The Raven vs. Rack Em Up:** Another fast, but uncontrollable robot, vs. the very well-controlled speed of Raven. RAU's long shape will also be awkward, and the ""dumpster"" is far too narrow to actually fit a robot. Raven will completely dominate this.

**Brain Damage vs. Swordfish:** Both robots have decent speed, but Swordfish seems a bit more maneuverable. Neither robot is going to be able to do much damage, but if Swordfish can get its long flipping nose under BD's dustpan BD won't really be able to use its ram, and if BD's dustpan is lower it will still kind of keep Swordfish out of reach. Picking Swordfish.

**Hexagone vs. Matanza:** So, this is actually two multi-weapon robots. Hexagone is quick, but I don't think its bars can actually do damage, and Matanza can attack on all sides with the spinning ring. It may be tough to hit the sides of Hexagone, but a flip from Matanza could easily cause serious damage just from the impact. Matanza wins this.

**V'Ger vs. Smilodon:** Hmm... So, most of Smilodon is pretty chewy, but its tail/keepaway bar will take the hits from V'Ger's bar pretty well. It's also proven to be a nightmare for flippers to get under, and this will be especially true with its speed advantage. This will be close, but I think Smilodon may pull off the win on aggression and strategy.",1467331702

* The ""influential cronies"" - and I feel I should call this out in particular because it is a character attack - are more heavily invested in ethereum than any of the rest of us. They've tied their lives and careers to the outcome of the ethereum experiment. (So attacks based on motive seem ridiculous to me)

* Bankers were culpable for the collapse of the financial system and profited from it. DAO investors (including ""influential cronies"") were victims in this, not perpetrators. Let's not vilify a couple of individuals when the truth is that the majority disagrees with an opinion. The honest thing to do is to say that ""I know that many if not most people disagree with me, but I would like to persuade them that perhaps they have overlooked the following..."". That is how you have an honest debate: with mutual respect.

&gt; Process and technicalities matter, a lot.

Sure, let's say something that hasn't already been said then instead of endlessly pushing an agenda (this is an ad after all). 

&gt; I think the only justifiable case for a fork should be a VM bug. If not, then we open ourselves up to moralistic forks, which should just not be something we consider doing, since we are not trying to create a moral code, we are trying to create a framework for institution building.

And many people appear to disagree on that front. It's not fun being in the minority, but it appears that the majority (we won't know until the fork takes place) support intervention at this point and under these circumstances with the information they have available to them. They have their own ethical, ideological and pragmatic considerations, just as you do. ""Fork == Bailout"" is just a bumper sticker for one particular point of view.",1467331706

It was the excess in government revenues from an increase in citizen wealth that led to massive governmental expansion (manifesting in programs, departments, and an overall federal employment boom) and encroachment into the lives of everyday americans.

I'm about to digress slightly so bear with me..

It's interesting to see the shift in thought process and attitudes in the last 20 years. There is zero accountability and no responsibility anymore. Everyone does there best to shift blame off of themselves onto someone (or something) else. Whether it's blaming government, blaming policies, blaming skin color, blaming circumstances...it just goes on and on. What we really need is for people to wake up and realize everyone is different, everyone has setbacks and failures, some of us are born into wealth some into poverty. Quite wasting time and money in attempting to establish some utopian level playing field where everyone starts at the same spot, and focus on doing the best YOU can. Take responsibility for your life and your future and stop blaming others for, what ultimately comes down to it, your failures.

This means it will be easier for people like your family to get your corpse, which you may not be concerned about but is actually a pain in the ass.

Having you on record in the country means they already have a paper trail to identify you and get the necessary balls rolling if you are arrested, kidnapped or injured.  It also means that if you are arrested/kidnapped/injured they can get access to your family faster and easier.

Sure you may have access to a phone if you're in jail but you still might not have all that much time to relay information to your embassy and you're going to want to relay information that you didn't have when you went into the country.

If you don't want to notify an embassy when you enter a country, that's fine but to argue that it does no good is straight up silly.

Are you likely to get in trouble in any given country if you have taken the time to know your shit, take precautions and pay attention to your surroundings?  Probably not.

Should you rely on the embassy to save your ass?  Fuck no.

Is giving them a bit of information when you enter a country ever going to fuck you?  For all reasonable situations, no it won't.

Is it possible that this information will help you or at the very least get information about the sad ass situation you got yourself into?  Yes, it is entirely possible.

I'm not saying doing this sort of thing will save your ass and it is quite possible you will be wasting 5 minutes of your own and someone else's time.

There is an entirely real possibility that this will save man hours when/if you do contact them *with a need* or when local law enforcement/medical services/emergency services contact your embassy *with a need* and you are unable to provide contact information because your in critical condition after being mugged and having a bunch of identification stolen.

I trust my dietician knows what she's doing and she would never prioritize weight loss over managing insulin/hormone levels, dealing with my gut health, and managing all that residual eating disordered mental garbage.  I have to heal a broken system before I can ask that system to burn fat.

I don't think she was ugly, I just say being fat is unhealthy and can give you heart problems and all that.

Tissue cultured plants develop stomates on the leaves which don't close like normal plants. They will dessicate quickly if the humidity is not near 100%. They absolutely will not survive lower humidity conditions until they grow new leaves with stomates that close.

Also be sure to get every little bit of media off of them before transferring to non-sterile conditions. The agar (or gelrite or whatever) is very nutritious and will grow mold and bacteria that will overgrow the plants before you know what's happening.

People leave matches sometimes, after some time the punishment should stop most players from doing so and it will happen only rarely. It's still annoying, but i could live with that.",1467331718

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","The difference, it seems, is that the Jem'Hadar and the Klingons, at least, have a value system that is geared toward personal sacrifice (Honor in the case of the Klingon, obedience to the Founders for the Jem'Hadar). Romulans and Cardassians both seem to value family above the state and the state above the individual. It seems conceivable that they would sacrifice themselves if one of these values were at stake though both species are presented as less monolithic in their values relative to Klingons and Jem'Hadar. 

The picture of Hirogen that we get is of a species that cares about personal glory more than anything else. They might care about their relative standing compared to other Hirogen but they don't seem to care about things beyond the glory that the hunt brings them as individual hunters. This makes me think that they wouldn't be willing to sacrifice themselves for a mission (there is no opportunity for glorious hunts once you are dead). They clearly seem willing to sacrifice themselves in the service of a glorious hunt, but only when success is possible. ",1467331718

- Holy shit I was not expecting that. I am a little sad about that. ***However*** this is actually pretty hype because now the final for that bracket is Paras vs. Pikachu, what a day to be alive.

- Also RIP my finals prediction, I did not realize that Round A and B would both be on the same side, making C and D also on the same side, so at some point it will be Rin vs. Saber, so only one of them will move on to finals. I hope it's [her](http://i.imgur.com/08PsGeR.gif) but wouldn't be surprised if it was [her](http://i.imgur.com/PnwOBEa.gif) instead.

- That is, if Saber can beat Alice, which I expect her too, but I will not be disappointed if Saber manages to lose, because Alice is [pretty fine](http://i.imgur.com/Nl8kwh6.png)

&gt;Whats your favorite childhood anime?

- Dragonball Z without a doubt, that show was hype as fuck. But Yu-Gi-Oh is a close second, since it teaches so much about the card game, I mean who doesn't know what Pot of Greed does?

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","As a cho otp who has played through highs and low's of cho'gath through multiple season's and elo's (bronze to low masters) there are a few major things prohibiting his success this season.

* Champions he formerly hard countered have been reworked or buffed to a point it is now even or he is countered (damn fiora parry!)

* Itemization: Overall players through out many elo's are poorly itemizing cho'gath in lane and not playing to his strengths (Roa as an example, great item but completely fails his powerspike). A highly successful build I have used as well as multiple other cho'gath otp's on many servers will be linked at the bottom.

*Mobility: He is simply too damn immobile, Nerfs to boots of swiftness as well as removal of alacrity hurt him compared to dah heavy champions.

* Hitboxes: Do we need to say much? Easy to dodge q and wacky/unreliable w make for a bad time against most players, even lower elo players are learning how easy he is to play against.

To hit on one of your highlu tilting points...

&gt; his base damage is high building tank

This is a big missconception, unlike other high rotation mages that can build tanky (ryze and vlad as an example) cho'gath has slow rotations in comparison and is much more reliant on burst damage, which he lacks as tank. With a tank build often times you find yourself cc'd and poked down by high crits, percent health damage, and grevious wounds.

Allot of your tankiness is reliant on sustaining in a 1 on one or possibly 1 on 2 setting in lane, once laning ends your sustain is significantly down (pretty low mana and health regen without the passive).

All this is being stated about lane cho'gath, jungle cho'gath is a different beast entirely but he covers a few of his weak points, now to the mentioned build (link to another thread)...

Reason: Crusaders have been one of the best teams going around this season and I think they'll show this again tonight. The Cheifs lost pretty badly to the Waratahs before the month off but redeamed themselves with a win over Wales but with Cruden getting a head knock in the 2nd test and him now starting on the bench plus a few other injuries I think the Crusaders should be able to get home in this one.

&gt;Ah, there it is. You were never a unionist. Such a pathetic comment at an attempt to insult ones nation would not have been used by someone who was a unionist.

What the fuck are you on about? I'm lying about my political opinions because I find the notion of reviving a dead empire ridiculous?

&gt;A unionist views England and Scotland as a union, you didn't get dragged into anything, we did it together. The jocks hands are equally as bloody.

&gt;If only you could realise the irony in what your saying, Scotland has been both a financial, social and democratic anchor to England for the last 300 years. Did we cut you off as soon as we could, have the English public ever wished for Scotland to be cast off into the sea?

Care to back up that statement? Because last I checked the entire reason England accepted the union was because it was enormously beneficial. All you're doing is tossing out insults because your fees fees got hurt.

&gt;If Scotland was suffering the worst political and financial crisis in its history, do you think for one second most people in England wouldn't immediately demand intervention? Do you think anyone in Britain would vote to take Scotland out of the Union? Of course not.

...Okay, you're clearly not getting this.

Imagine Scotland and England were swapped. Scotland having the larger population and voting power.

Imagine England faced a vote to leave the union and refused. Then two years later, Scotland launched a vote to initiate a political and financial crisis. England doesn't vote to commit suicide, nor does Wales, but NI and Scotland both do, and because they have a much larger voting population the overall vote goes to suicide.

Now do you honestly believe that in such a scenario England would choose to stick around and go down with the ship? Really?

That's simply not realistic. And frankly, asking someone to do such a thing is pretty damn selfish.

&gt;It's both a mentality of victim hood and a mentality of wanting to stick it to the English. If sturgeon represents Scottish views, the Scottish are gagging for their time in the sun to stick the spear in the English back while its vulnerable.

Could you cry victim any harder? Nobody is sticking it to the English here you big baby. The English stuck it to everyone else and now you want the people they screwed to turn around and help them? How goddamn entitled can you get?

&gt;The English would NEVER stand for stabbing Scotland in the back

...Are you joking? That's literally what England did. Literally. And now you have the fucking cheek to ask for help from the people you pulled off a cliff. 

&gt; and casting it off, and I would fight for Scotland like it was my homeland.

&gt;It's a real fucking shame that the Scottish have used the tensions and turmoil in this turbulent time to break up the union. 

You should open a salt mine. Or invent a time machine, head back and maybe push a little harder for England to not fuck the rest of us over. ",1467331725

"csharp","t5_2qhdf","The crux of your dilemma has been answered already - there's nothing wrong with referencing multiple services from the same controller - so I'm just adding some commentary/observations.

I suspect you can probably break your services down further still, into more isolated/granular services. If there are large chunks of each service that are unrelated to other chunks, this is probably the case. Maybe try adding related (public) methods to their own interfaces on the service class to identify the roles that these services play, and then see about refactoring them into separate domains from there.

Also if things are getting ""big"" you might benefit from a service locator or service bus, especially if you want to do the above, and dispatch commands from the controllers so they have no coupling at all to the services. The services then subscribe to the commands they handle from the bus. This doesn't need to be asynchronous, nor does it need to be distributed (searching for service bus or locator will bring up results about both of those scenarios). I personally have benefitted from using a ""command dispatch and response"" pattern in my applications, even in memory, to really break any coupling between layers.",1467331728

He also just had so many great moments during that last fight with Kid Buu from accepting Goku's superiority to coming up with the plan to beat Buu and even being prepared to cease to exist to buy Goku enough time for the Spirit Bomb. 

In Super, we get to further see how Vegeta's changed from throwing away his pride to protect his family to feigning the villain just to teach Cabba SSJ.

"ethereum","t5_2zf9m","i think this proposal has unintended side effects and carries more risk than the mining consensus alternative, since no one really wants their ether locked up for long periods of time.

it also discourages trading/spending/using, which is the lifeblood of exchanges - and merchants  - payment processors etc- which may mean they have a vested interest to discourage voting and also not participate in any votes themselves.

it reduces the velocity of ether, which depresses its value.

and most importantly it creates massive predictable downwards price events when lockups expire (just like on the stock market after the ipo of a company whose shareholders have signed a lockup agreement).  the moment that the funds are unlocked - for instance, at the 3 month deadline is a massive cliff where a lot of ether would be sold at the same time. this would encourage shorting and a downwards price spiral culminating in a specific moment that a lot of ether gets unlocked and sold - the exact moment the price is guaranteed to crash!

this proposed mechanism seems to have too many unintended side effects, and i still believe its simpler and less divisive to leave the consensus voting to the miners as they did with the soft fork.  any other system can be gamed too much. 

personally, if i had a vote it would be to hard fork and get it over with as soon as possible, then get back to work on building value and a good ethereum ecosystem.  improve the tools and techniques to allow future smart contracts to be more robust and trusted than they are at this time.

Maybe what's happening in Britain and what would happen in the USA if Trump gets elected could possibly be a good thing in the end by killing this new wave of neo-nationalism and populism for a while. The problem is that it's just speculation and it's just as likely that the world will go fucking haywire because of the waves it will cause. These people can cause a chain reaction that could have very serious repercussions and it would definitely not be better than trying to change the status quo through a stronger democratic effort. 

In my opinion the latter is a way better option and that is why sane and rational people must win, however small victories they can. The world is moving forward and progress is being achieved, don't be fooled by dreams of a future past when things used to be better, because they weren't. Corruption, wars, great inequality, these problems always existed, many times in doses much greater than now. Democratic efforts can make a difference and I feel like we're on a cusp now to be able to do just that. What needs to happen is our generations growing up already and start making a difference, because currently we're a pathetic bunch that barely turns out to vote. But that's true for every young generation that ever came before, so it will change as time moves on, I think that through real efforts in democracy we can make things better and build something rock solid and I think it's a better option than setting ourselves on fire a little and hoping it'll be a-okay in the end. As I see it, the best case scenario when electing Trump will still set us back who knows how many years, I mean the thought that he could name the judges on the Supreme Court alone makes it obvious that it will probably set the USA back with 10 to 20 years in many ways.

TL;DR: Demographics favor us heavily, instead of setting ourselves back who knows how many years, maybe it would be better to fight the status quo while not risking to destroy everything.",1467331735

"CompetitiveWoW","t5_35p2p","One thing immediately jumping out at me from the first log on your best attempt (#9, lasted for 6:45, and was closest to killing the boss, also ignoring events after 4 deaths because that seemed to still be in control at that point, then there's a gigantic wave of deaths), that three of your dps are EXTRAORDINARILY low on damage to be getting beaten out by shadow priests, being Tuca, Mightylink, and Sthyxia. I'm not saying that them doing appropriate damage would make or break your kills, because there's still the issue of a shit ton of people dying at once, but coming to a raid without doing ilvl-appropriate damage can be a concern when looking at the raid as a whole.

On to the next issue - three people died to falling off of the edge, which is completely unacceptable. If it had been that the group had screwed up placing the goo to cover enough ground for people to not die, I'd expect to see **the whole group** go off the edge, not just three people. This is where your group breaks down on this attempt, which spirals into a ton of people dying from imps not dying fast enough.

On attempt 21, I'm looking at 2 out of the 3 people I had mentioned earlier doing low dps again, especially for their item levels, there's really no excuse there. Ignoring after 4 on this attempt would do nothing, so I'm actually not going to ignore any deaths, but rather keep in mind who died where. Being that Tuca is consistently one of the last people to die (usually at about 2/3rds of the group already being dead), I'd say his/her active time of 89.53%(ignoring after 9 to get exact percentage, as they were 9th to die.) is low, considering the remaining 10% of that active time is 30 whole seconds of missed opportunities to hit ***anything at all***. Being that this person *could* be soaking and I'm too lazy to look to be quite honest, that leaves 20 seconds of complete inactive time if they soaked for a full 10 seconds, 18 if they disengaged out after soaking. Inactive time is just straight lost damage. 

edit: i'm also so lazy and disenchanted with doing anything at all that I'm too lazy to finish looking at stuff, even though I want to. back to barely caring about rocket league.",1467331741

IMO Wizard could easily be replaced by Princess. Or Spear Goblins for more chip damage. Cannon could be swapped for Ice Wizard. Deck plays differently from most Golem decks because it relies on guaranteed chip damage with Golem/Poison/Barrel. Wizard is a noticeable weak point but Bomber can't hit air and Fire Spirits doesn't help too much here.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Atheist here, your ""what if"" is my life. (Mostly. I think Jesus probably existed, but that's about all.) And that's great. That *why* I have purpose. If there was an afterlife, what's the point of all this? It's just the worlds longest, most terrible line to get into the theme park. Just a holding pen.

&amp;nbsp;

But since this is my one shot to do something, I have to make the best of it. I have 80 years, give or take, to do something to leave humanity in better shape than when I arrived. And when I'm gone, I'm gone. All that matters is what I did while I was here. 

&amp;nbsp;

So that means I can just kick back and enjoy myself, right? No higher purpose, I can just live for pleasure than kick off when I'm done, right? No. Just the opposite. Because humans can understand cause and effect, and experience empathy, we have an obligation to each other to at the very least not harm each other, but more than that, we should act in such a way that we improve our overall condition.

&amp;nbsp;

So I'm an educator, and I've done a bit of research that might contribute to being able to better deal with viral diseases one day down the road. I'm doing something that I enjoy, for which I have a passion, and that benefits people in some way. And beyond being fortunate enough to have found something I enjoy, I rest easy knowing that when I'm gone, I will have done things that benefited people along the way. 

&amp;nbsp;

So what if there's no god? What if Jesus didn't exist? Get to work. You have one shot, and since we're all so smart with our frontal lobes and higher-order cognitive functions, you, and we, have an obligation to do something positive with our brief time here. If that's not a meaning or purpose, I don't know what is.",1467331742

"news","t5_2qh3l","Except the problem isn't really about differences between states, but rather differences between urban and rural communities. It would still be unfair for New York state--which is largely rural--to be bound by NYC's gun laws. Likewise, it's possible to make the argument (although without looking at numbers first I wouldn't make it) that Texas's relatively lax gun laws create problems for its major cities.

Also there's the larger problem that is presented by the variability in gun laws across state (or county) lines. If someone can just drive to the next state over and purchase a gun over the counter without a background check, what good will it actually do for their home state (or city) to have strict licensing and checks in place?

That's why I generally support the idea that gun laws should be as consistent as possible across the nation--with mild precautions like instant background checks in place but stupid measures like ""assault weapons bans"" abolished. So everyone can own a gun with minimal hardship, but reasonable barriers exist for the main group of people who are actually worth screening for (domestic abusers... the other things a background check can look for aren't particularly statistically important). 

Meanwhile, if cities want to have a policy forbidding either open or concealed carry in public (not in a locked case), I guess I don't have a problem with that... that's a reasonable assertion of local jurisdiction in my mind.",1467331749

This seems like an accident waiting to happen.  I wouldn't expect even very responsible people to hold on to steering wheels and stay alert after letting autopilot control the vehicle for even a few minutes.  They'd have to have their hands on the wheel, stay at perfect attention, and have even better reflexes than otherwise driving as they'd have to trust the autopilot.  At the same time they'd have to be making sure the autopilot isn't about to do something dangerous.  I know Tesla called this out, but I just don't think it's reasonable to expect drivers to trust the autopilot while staying alert enough to override it in such fast emergencies.  ",1467331749

"Diepio","t5_3e819","Out penetration, but no real counters. A penta-shot can run from basically everything in the same way that a booster and fighter can, just slower but with more bullets to cover their trail.

Nothing says that penta-shots can't strafe around to get a better angle at killing someone, which is easy considering their speed.

With their recoil, they can do something better than most other tanks... Chase someone down to guarantee a kill on anyone who doesn't upgrade their bullets correctly or anyone who is just vulnerable to this tank in general.

Besides, survival is more important than killing in ffa, which is why penta-shot is one of the best ffa tanks, but the opposite is true in domination, where if you don't kill, your team will lose... But not-dying is a useful quality there as well, because you might be able to back up your team and your team might be able to do the same.

This may be a bullet spammer, but he's still a different bullet spammer, giving him the same stats as a triplet, does not take his abilities to their full potential. The same mistake can be made by building a hunter like a ranger, but instead, there is a unique hunter build that's significantly more effective.

Are you sure you're taking his abilities to his full potential? Don't ask me, I haven't perfected penta-shot stats either... In fact, he shares more qualities in common with the fighter, than the triplet.",1467331750

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","The first haul post by hernameisplumdelepretty, someone help me out here - is a good starting point on what products to focus on first. 

Then when you want to play and explore essences, actives, masks, yaddayadda, I recommend trying to get samples/decants before committing to full size. RRS, amazon, other places someone help me out here too - these are all good places that sell packs of samples to trial the product. There's also /r/asianbeautyexchange where you can buy from other users, decants or full size that were previously used. The products you have tried and were fine with are also good indicators - all those ingredients, your skin is okay with. If a product irritates you, start playing detective by comparing ingredient lists and seeing what they share in common with safe products for you and what might be the culprit. That will help refine future buying choices.  

Also look into how to patch test, which is super simple, and how to recover if your skin does experience irritation.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Around age 11 or 12 my dad gave me one of his old exercise magazines and although I was interested in working out I'd spend a lot of time looking at the guys in it. I didn't really think anything of it though, I just figured I really wanted to look like them (which was true, I was just missing a added detail). Also, Chris O'Donnel in the old Batman movies was a wake up call of sorts, as was Gerard Butler (which is funny, because I don't really find him attractive at all now) most likely due to 300.  Speaking of 300, the movie Meet the Spartans that spoofed it featured a lot of homoeroticism that I kind of realized I really enjoyed (even though it was stupid and mostly meant to be a joke).

Throughout high school I was ""attracted"" to girls, had a couple girlfriends, and even a relationship that lasted quite a long time. I never had any sexual encounters beyond making out though, and just attributed it to my desire to wait until marriage, but I always fantasized about being with guys. I always wrote that off as pure fantasies, or just a phase...until it wasn't a phase. 

I only just accepted it a couple years ago, about halfway through college after my relationship with a girl ended and I figured I should address these feelings I'd been denying for so long. Sorta still getting comfortable in my own skin, but I'm working on it.  ",1467331750

"OCPoetry","t5_30xom","&gt;Wasn't one of your previous primers on the topic of blank verse an example a poetic format that uses meter without rhyme?

Yes, it is. Excellent point.  This is one of those counter-examples that ""prove"" the rule, and shows how flexible and context-specific such ""rules"" have to be.  Poetry, like jazz, all but actively defies any attempt at categorization.  Its only true ""rule"" seems to be that there are no rules. For every mechanic we discuss, there will always be counter-examples that seem to disprove its validity.  

It's important to know *how* blank verse works, though, in order to understand why it seems to defy this convention of rhyme &amp; meter coexisting.  Blank Verse, remember, is an evolution of, and in some ways a rebellion against, Heroic Verse, in which 10-syllable lines are arranged into rhyming couplets, in a strict ABAB scheme, with strict adherence to an iambic pentameter rhythm scheme.  Poets who developed Blank Verse were looking for a format which recalled the formality, pomp and circumstance, and epic nature of Heroic Verse, combined with a more flexible means of narrative expression.  Blank Verse arose as a kind of compromise between the strict rules of the former, and the more conversational tone of prosaic text.  

If you look, you will find other similar compromises smattered throughout the poetic forms, which work in seemingly self-contradictory ways.  In some ways, a Cinquain is one such compromise – combining the strict syllabic rules of the haiku with the a slightly larger set of lines, allowing poets to develop their ideas and imagery more fully and richly, but using the same mechanical means of juxtaposition as a haiku does.  Does the existence of the Cinquain mean that the haiku's extraordinary restraints on length are unnecessary?  No, moreover, it only *proves* why those mechanical constraints work so well.  

&gt;My opinion would largely be that rhyme should almost always incorporate a meter to facilitate it.

I agree, and this is essentially the same argument as I have made in my previous comment.  And I'll go one step further.  Because our system of notating the accented and unaccented syllables is only one such way of thinking about the various phonosemantic aspects of words.  There are many other such methods, which focus on completely different aspects of diction rather than loudness and softness.  There is an old Norse tradition, for example, of only counting the *long* syllables in words, and a well-formed poetic line in the Norse tradition should have the same number of *long* syllables in each line, but the number of *short* syllables may vary widely.  And in ancient Greek traditions, there were *three* possible loudness markings, not just two like in modern poetry.  Scansion of a particular line of Greek poetry might include symbols for stressed syllables, unstressed syllables, and *medium-stressed* syllables, which may function as either-or, or even both simultaneously! 

So our modern system of keeping track of rhythm isn't even the only possible way, and if it were, poetry would be very dull indeed.  But what's clear is that *some* level of rhythmic organisation is almost always preferred, when lines are supposed to rhyme with each other. It just sounds ""right"".  

I'm so glad you bring up Cummings, because he's one of my favorite poets: a true lingual iconoclast.  But much of his poetry works*because* it defies convention.  If our modern grammatical rules were so flexible already as to allow lines like ""anyone lived in a pretty how town"", and that sentence made perfect logical sense, and no confusion was possible from hearing it, would it be as powerful?  Would it be as *poetic*?  I argue that it would not.  I argue that its value as poetry stems directly from its grammatical oddity, and that fact that it has entered into a conversation with the reader *about the constraints of grammar conventions itself*.  But even more than this conversation with the reader, Cummings' poems exist in a conversational relationship with *other poetry* which uses a much more rigid grammatical structure.  More than claiming that his poem ""doesn't need"" those constraints to fulfill its purpose, it uses the expectations we have developed about grammar and sentence structure *against us* in order to do so.  And that's the point. 

Can you write an effective poem that uses rhyme but lacks any sense of meter?  Yes. Probably.  But only if, like Cummings, you find a way to use our own expectations about rhyme and rhythm against ourselves.  And that can only happen *purposefully*.  Which means acknowledging the standard ""rule"", and then conciously writing something contrary to it.  ",1467331751

I say stick to your calories right now, but maybe add some extra bananas or a protein bar/drink to your post workouts. I also have one naughty thing a day, either a cookie or a muffin or something. It's always within my calorie count and I make sure of it. 

Cooking as a whole isn't that bad. Stick your veg in a pan, boil it until it's ready, put a couple of things in the oven and you're done. I eat vegetarian but when I ate meat it didn't take any longer. Potatoes usually take the longest. Stay away from ready meals unless it's for a treat. 

As for the workout, just do as much as you can. I keep the video running when I stop and just go when I can. I do the Insanity workout and enjoy the challenge but it's not easy. I also recommend if you have a hard time with the press ups etc, find ways of building up your strength to do them. There is no shame in doing press ups on your knees to build up your strength. Make sure you squat properly as well. That means squatting down, knees behind your toes, not in front, your ass right back and back straight. It's like your going to sit down on a chair. Also keep your feet pointing forwards. Start off slow with squats, its very easy to hurt yourself with them if you don't do them right. ",1467331752

Yes. Each Entity's timestamp is updated whenever it is generated and whenever it enters play.

If a transformed Zerus is in your hand when you play the Bot then it has transformed for the first time before you played the Bot.

While the above-mentioned indicators may in many cases still be true, that doesn't necessarily mean that this sort of communication is completely devoid of meaning or that it does not also add more nuance to the message a person is conveying.  The study suggests that a conscientious speaker making an effort to balance the values of thorough discourse and brevity might gloss over points that might be considered tedious, offensive to one or more parties, or controversial and indicate their decision to do so by leaving one of these discourse markers in its place.  So by not dismissing these ""likes and umms"" the listener can actually pick up on these indicators that there is more information found between the lines or so to speak that the speaker does not feel comfortable conveying at that time and/or in front of that particular audience.",1467331758

Para começar, nunca há um canal totalmente independente. Depois, esse canal seria de televisão? Ou era através da Internet, através de artigos? De qualquer forma, se eles iriam fazer o que já se faz agora, qual seria a vantagem do teu sistema? Era só o facto de vir de um canal independente? Isso é irrelevante. Há sempre formas de manipular a informação. Basta ver os jornais ou websites que têm sempre uma inclinação política e são, supostamente, imparciais.

Como é que avaliavas se alguém estava bem informado sobre o processo eleitoral? Faziam um questionário em papel antes de votarem? Através da Internet? Como? E tentares averiguar se alguém estava bem informado ou não seria demasiado caro em termos de recursos, além de alienar as pessoas porque, vamos ser sinceros, quem é que quereria ser sujeito a avaliações e questionários só para poder votar? Seria um processo chato que, como já disse, afastaria muitas pessoas que se calhar até votam conscientemente mas não querem passar por este processo todo. Logo, só os fanáticos, maioritariamente, é que votariam, e os partidos no poder seriam iguais.

Portanto, a tua ideia é boa, a de querer que a população esteja mais informada. Mas aplica-la de uma forma muito errada. Não podes obrigar que as pessoas que vão votar estejam informadas. O que tem de haver é um maior interesse pela política. Em Portugal há pouco interesse, porque já se sabe que quem estiver no 'poleiro' vai fazer o mesmo de sempre: ajudar os amigos, tentar destruir o trabalho do partido anterior, para poder dizer que eles é que são bons, mentir, corromper, endividar o país, etc., etc.. 

Pediste outras ideias, por isso vou dar algumas:
1 - Acabar com tudo o que seja JS, JSD, JBE (nem sei se isto existe, mas é para passar a ideia). Os partidos começam muito cedo a endoutrinar os jovens, que depois quando chegam adultos são os fanáticos que vão sempre votar no partido deles e que têm sempre uma cunha.
2 - Condenar os políticos que devem ser condenados. As pessoas não têm interesse na política também por verem que não lhes (políticos) acontece nada se cometem um crime. E eles (políticos) já nem disfarçam.
3 - Acabar com as cunhas na FP. Sempre que muda o partido no 'poleiro' há rotação na FP. É um desperdício de dinheiro e é por isso que a FP funciona mal, porque não são os mais competentes nos lugares mas aqueles que têm a cunha certa.
4 - Acabarem com os políticos de carreira, que mamam milhares ou milhões de euros dos nossos impostos ao longo da sua vida, sem nunca fazerem nada. Basicamente, deixarem de ter todas as mordomias que têm agora. É que muitos deles não querem saber se melhoram ou não o país, mas sim se o país melhora ou não a condição financeira deles. 
5 - Tentar que os partidos trabalhem em conjunto para o benefício do país e não ser como acontece agora, em que o PS diz que todas as propostas do PSD são uma porcaria e vice-versa (é um exagero, mas dá para perceber o que quero dizer).

Estas são as minhas medidas para que a Democracia melhore. Não é mudar o sistema, por assim dizer, mas mudar quem está no sistema e as regras que só se aplicam a eles. Talvez assim as pessoas se começassem a interessar em quem iria governá-los durante 4 anos. ",1467331760

No it's not.

&gt;The refugee regulations broadly say ""you have to go back when it's safe""... unless it takes like a decade and by then they can stay forever.

which aside from the fact that is not exacly how it works would not change things, people who stay forever in a country as refugees still are not eligible to have EU passports, unless they become EU citizens which is a process of it's own for which a lot of different things factors in like being able to speak the official language and have no criminal records and stuff like that, the average number of non EU-Native who manage to get an EU citizenship is around 2%.

&gt;Do you believe, with the current political leanings of EU politicans, that they'll actually send them back?

I can't really say, for sure once ""It is safe"" Every single country in the EU has the right to send them back without even having to be questioned by the EU, so is a Case by case and UK would have been free to send home whoever they wanted on those premises, also whether they remain or not it would not change the fact that to freely travel in the EU they would need to be EU citizens and not just refugees.

I currently only use the Scalp Pack and it has been life changing in how great it makes my hair look and feel (I only wash my hair 1-2x a week bc it is so thick and dry) - I've only been using the Pack on my scalp though. However, it makes such a difference in the psoriasis patches I sometimes get on my scalp (gone!) and somehow makes my hair bouncy and super moisturized at the same time with absolutely not product residue or build up like some conditioners do. I usually follow up with the Perfect Fill Up ampoules (I use both every time bc my hair wash days are a whole spa day experience tbh). What effects do you get from the scalp scaling Ampoule alone?  In other words, is it worth adding more weight to my cart :) ?

I'm about to place an order at RRS to restock both of those, but now I'm dying to know what the difference in effects for you is between the Ampoule and the Pack.

The gameplay is frantic, but combat is smooth and flows naturally (60 FPS). Boss battles are among the most memorable in the series, and are backed up by amazing dynamic music.

We'll have to see, it depends on how good our negotiators and theirs are I think. Our situation/these circumstances are unprecedented so I really don't know how it will go

'Sir Lynton Crosby, Boris Johnson’s campaign manager, was making final preparations for the formal announcement of Mr Johnson’s Tory leadership bid when his phone rang at 8.53 on Thursday morning.

“Hi Lynton, it’s Michael Gove here,” said the voice on the other end. “I’m running.”

“Running what?” Sir Lynton replied.

“I’m running for the leadership myself.”
Sir Lynton was stunned. With two hours to go until the launch of Mr Johnson’s leadership bid, Mr Gove, the man who was supposed to be making up the “dream ticket” with him, had not so much stabbed him in the back as run him through with a pikestaff.'

^ Utter bollocks, he clearly was running.

To me, taking back our borders doesn't mean bringing down migration to the tens of thousands, which is beyond retarded as a target in itself. It just means the we have a say in what the numbers should be and what types of labour they should be comprised of etc. year to year as it changes. I broadly agree with what David Davis had to say about it

I don't think many of the leave side were completely 100% agreed with eachother on what should be done with immigration, Daniel Hannan has very different views to Nigel Farage for example.

The idea that we need EU migration, mainly because if we don't get it our pensions won't be paid seems profoundly stupid to me. By that logic we will need even *more* EU migrants to come over and work to pay for the pensions of the EU migrants who came over before, and again, and again and again. Over and over.

"letsplay","t5_2qss1","When it comes to let's plays, I think your ""more general approach"" is the way to go.  In all honestly, can you think of any really good reason to ever publicly promote ANY let's play video?  The only reason I can think of is if you're doing something incredibly unique and niche.  For example, if the Nuzlocke challenge for Pokemon was invented literally today, it *might* be worth promoting.  *Might*.  At the end of the day, who really cares?  You're not doing anything that can't just be found from a hundred different content creators with a quick search if someone wanted it.  And that's probably the trap that the ignorant and inexperienced fall into.

And that's the crux of the issue with let's play, I think.  I think that the ""general approach"" is the *only* way to go for that content, and it's why so many people suggest ""gateway videos""... because they CAN be something worth promoting.  For a pure LP channel you're stuck playing the game, and unless you've got something like the top 0.1% of charismatic and hilarious personalities with great SEO, I sincerely doubt that you can make it to any significant size these days playing older stuff that isn't being searched for often.  It's a tough reality, one that many don't really understand.  Although I could be COMPLETELY wrong in that assessment.  Who *really* knows?

&gt; Which day did you share that video on? Just curious which day it was shared versus how traffic came in. Also, out of curiosity, what's the average watch time for it?

Looked it up, looks like I shared it a little over an hour after it went live on my channel.  The subreddit was /r/globalagenda2 (you can see just how tiny that is, my only goal was to share my opinion with people who would probably feel similarly... I wasn't even thinking about views when I did this).  Average watch time peaked at 11 minutes and maintained an average of about 9+ minutes through the duration of the spike, pretty good for a 20 minute video I think.  It has since dropped to about 7.5 minutes, but honestly I'm surprised the video is still getting views since the material is so out of date by now.

&gt; Ouch. Yeah, that is a downside. But, I'm willing to bet you'd do the same thing again a thousand times rather than climb up to 6k from 350 the organic way.

OH MY GOD a million times yes!  It's like I don't know what to do with myself anymore without hundreds of comments to read, haha.  The downswing is actually my own fault.  I have a mixed-bag of a channel with waaay more LP videos than scripted content.  Video goes viral, people sub, but most don't care about the majority of my content (LPs) so they unsub because they don't care, plus the scripted stuff gets buried (or hidden because they haven't been clicking).  Just the other day I made an announcement on my channel that I'm splitting generic LPs off to a second channel so I'm hoping that helps alleviate that problem.  Honestly, I would have unsubbed to me too because even though I do LP videos, I rarely watch them myself :P

&gt; though of course, once again, there are many factors...

I think that's what makes this such an interesting conversation topic.  You can talk about SEO all you want but it's rare for any amount of talking to truly encompass how complex it really is.

If I wanted to play a heavy armor melee build for dps, what would it be or does heavy armor and dps not work together.

For weapons I would sword/shield in pve and pvp but switch off to a more dps oriented weapon like DW or 2h, not sure which one would synergize more with sword/shield.

would I do a magicka build or stamina build?",1467331767

I started out with 4 months in the US/1 month other country/4 months US/3 months other country. My next goal was to string all the US time together and all the 'other country' time together so it wasn't chopped up in blocks. After a couple of years I managed that, and then I worked towards more of a 50/50 split. I really needed to keep my American paycheck, was the thing. I couldn't possibly earn enough (nor get the visa and permits) to actually work full time in the other country, but I could do remote work from there.  

I love it. I feel like I have the best of both worlds. And like you, I live in a place in the US that others really love visiting, so I rent out my house while I'm overseas. I make just enough doing that to pay for all of my traveling and for my apartment overseas.

"Redskins","t5_2r4wc","This pass rush and cornerback combination could be very intimidating and easily fuck with an inexperienced quarterback. Unfortunately the only iffy QBs we'll be playing are Bradford, RG3, and Bridgewater. We'll need the rest of our defense to play at least good-but-not-great if we're going to stop some of the best offenses in the league.

I think our D-Line will be decent. Paea is a good player and will have a bounceback in his second year here. Both him and Baker have experience playing NT so they'll move around. Fricky Jean is an above average rotational guy. I think our ILBs will be the glue that holds this defense together. Compton seems to be accepting his role as the ""QB of the defense"". Foster is solid but not good. I like Riley's coverage skills and ability to make plays but he's not too different overall from Foster who is a year younger and much cheaper.

Academic ratings are literally on the same level of college football rankings in that they are subjective as hell. The ratings are based off a bunch of academics opinions and how much research is done. Rankings are done so professors can feel special and sell their schools, they dont mean alot in the grand scheme of things.

Considering that you can get an AA with a 3.0 and transfer to UF after 2 years of CC, its not like you getting in would have been that great of an accomplishment. Poli Sci/Criminology arent super useful degrees to go to school for either. I got a Poli Sci degree and it was a waste of time. I liked what I learned about but spending the time in school to get it is a joke. You could go volunteer for alot of people (since people in poli sci love free labor) and get experience without having to spend money on classes. The field is pretty toxic since its just adults acting like children to get into office and there is not good money to be made since politicians dont make anything unlike corporations that make money selling shit. Yes Tally is the capital, but most political jobs will make you work 60+ hours, dont pay well, dont have good job advancement and are extremely stressful. Unless you end up in congress, theres not good work in Poli Sci.

Also, UF is more of a school for hard science. It would have not mattered if you went for social science. UF is better than FSU for some sciences and Gainesville is a bit smaller and nice than Tally, but thats about it. If your experience was good at FSU then I would not see why having a ""what if"" moment about UF even matters.",1467331779

"MMA","t5_2qhj4","bitrate is the amount of information. for example, 720p data source is usually around 2250 kb/s. 1080p data source is usually 3,200 kb/s. That difference is more information which is giving you the better clarity. Watching something thats 1080p on a 720p screen, looks better than 720p on 720p. 

4k is usuallly around 10,000kb/s. Thats a ton of data about lighting, colors, and movement. The higher bitrate makes 4k on a 1080p screen look better than 1080p data on a 1080p.

They are trained on the civilizations holy planet which is totally surrounded by a planet sized space station called a Citadel. Only followers who have been born in space may enter the Templar order and the training takes many many years and enhancements to the body and mind. The end result is a holy mage that can destroy a sun.

There's an order of knights called the Silver Sun Core that exist billions of years after the Templar's civilization turned into dust. Their order is descended from a group of mercenaries who, led by a man named Ceruilen Silver, took over an entire continent of warring human kingdoms. Their armor is made from Highmountain Steel, a metal imbued with bits of an extra-universal being which ended a galactic civilization billions of years before the Templar's. 

There's an order of Elves who live in a dwarven mining capital deep within a volcano, while the rest of the material realm is being scoured clean by a hivemind of self-replicators called the Thanixians. They serve to protect the elder dragon of order who sleeping in the cites core, who is protecting the planet with her dreams.

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","I was amongst the first group of people to agree with the two base form theory because I feel like it was the best explanation. People tried to play it down by giving their reasons such as Goku turned SSJ against Beerus so it means that SSJ is as strong as SSJG, this led me to kind of keep quiet about that theory for a while until I realised in the manga that Goku didn't turn into a SSJ in his fight with Beerus after the SSJG transformation. 

The thing that I'm trying to figure out now to make sense of the theory is that in the recent manga chapter 13, Goku turned into a SSJ to fight against Hit; who beat SSGSS Vegeta. And it is stated that Vegeta was only at around 10% of his power which I think should still be way more than the SSJ version of Goku. So I am trying to pass that off as Hit holding back a lot more against Goku than he did against Vegeta. This is because Hit wants Goku to draw out his full oower and Goku said somewhere along the lines of that he's saving SSGSS for later. 

Then there is the other thing that is bugging me in which I don't have an answer for which is if he is at God level in his base of his God Ki base form, then what is the reason in turning into a SSG? I might just end up passing that off as being an extra multiplier so it is like God Ki Base being weaker than God Ki SSJ God? And that being weaker than SSGSS

I mean if it wasn't the two base form theory that means Piccolo with no special training, Gohan, Universe 6 fighters apart from Hit, Future Trunks etc. are all of a God tier level, which is ridiculous.",1467331783

Like, 9 is more than enough time to absorb the biases of the outside world, it doesn't need to involve direct engagement with beauty advertising or dolls. Like they've literally done tests on it with kids way younger than that. If you're old enough to have an opinion, you're old enough to have it altered by the climate you live in, thems just the facts.

There's a lot of reasons changing your skin colour is not seen as the same as getting rid of a bump in your nose, for example, it's really apples and oranges. It's not an equal argument. In order to be even slightly on the same level (although even then, no one culture's history is ever the same and can be equally compared), we'd need to be talking about me wanting to make my nose smaller to look less Jewish. It's my right, but it's also an absolute tragedy in my opinion for more reasons than I think I could share on here. I don't want to force you to do anything, I just want to give you some other options because what you're asking is very difficult if not impossible, coming from a purely objective angle. I feel pretty sure it's not going to make you happy either, from a less objective one, but that's not my right to say. I'm just saying, that 'dark skin empowerment junk' might not be what you want but it's the more realistic choice.

But nevermind, you don't want to know. What I will tell you though, from a skincare point of view, that kojic acid soap is not going to help. Kojic acid does the same thing as all the items people have suggested to you so far: it removes excess pigment like freckles, sunspots and hyperpigmentation from acne etc. People saying it will bleach your skin are either lying to sell a product or misinformed. The fact it's a soap is also problematic because soap is alkali and your skin is naturally slightly acidic. Constantly putting your skin under the stress of leaving an alkaline substance on it for minutes at a time is gonna be bad for your skin, it's going to make your natural defences weaker, it a going to dry it out and it may cause break outs, which are going to add more pigment to your skin. And these are things people are saying about soap in general, not even factoring in leaving it to cook on your face long enough for the active ingredient to work. Here is a link, and at the bottom they have the references to the studies used:

I think if you need to do something at home, washing with a low ph cleanser would help to start. Then trying things like vitamin c serums and products with arbutin and liquorice root in them. If you really want to try kojic acid then try to find a cream with it in, it'll be better for your skin. Products like arbutin aren't advised for daily use though. There have also been some worries about the toxicity of kojic acid too so maybe look it up to see whether it's safe, I'd do it but honestly I'm tired. Basically, the bottom line is that if you do this badly you're going to end up getting the opposite of what you want.

If that's not enough then see a dermatologist. But I'm pretty sure if they're reputable they're gonna say the same sort of thing as us.

I'm really sorry we can't offer you what you want. I think you're going to find that a lot of places and it's not just because of racial history or any biases, it's about the bare bones science of it.",1467331783

&gt; How can goalies read plays with any consistency when they have no consistency in the structure in front of them? How can goalies that face fewer grade-A chances be fairly evaluated when they appear to rarely make a “big save”? What characteristics really matter when evaluating a goalie’s performance? These are the questions that drove me to write my articles.

Scrivens comments quite extensively about goaltenders' superstitions, while respectfully highlighting Patrick Roy's infamous habits, and also gives a brief, yet positive shout-out to Sakic.

By your logic, cars are also objects of death. They are huge metal machines that barrel down the street at incredible speeds and result in far many deaths, yet they don't face the same scrutiny as guns. Cars can be both recreational and deadly and, in fact, cars have been used in many terrorist attacks that have resulted in huge casualties.

Also, alcohol literally impairs your decision making and motor skills to the point where thousands die every year because of it, and is also responsible for alcohol poisoning and liver failure, and yet that's somehow not an object of death?

High-sugar and high-fat foods are far more harmful than they are helpful, and contribute to heart failure (the largest cause of death in the united states) and obesity and yet you don't consider those objects of death?

Your argument is simply silly. Guns don't kills people even close to as much as you'd like to believe in your fantasy, and they are a protected constitutional right which gives them far greater importance than any privilege granted by the government.

Lead is also not toxic in minute doses. As I said, toxicity is always dependent on concentration. Lead isn't excreted readily, which is part of why chronic lead poisoning has such severe repercussions. Fluoride is flushed about as easily as chloride is - thus acute toxicity is the only concern, and unless you use NaF like table salt, that won't happen.

If you don't care about racing and are riding a fair bit of offroad I would certainly say get a gravel bike rather than a road bike (or pure cyclocross bike). 

That bike looks OK, but I really don't like the choice of skinny 28c tires it comes with and it doesn't look like it has a ton of tire clearance for much bigger tires, which are what give you more comfort and more capability when riding offroad.

The brakes are also not ones I'd expect to see on a bike at that price and have a poor reputation. 

It seems quite overpriced in general, the frame looks nice but otherwise it looks equivalent in quality to a bike costing a few hundred dollars less from other brands, only Sora drivetrain (the bottom of the range for a proper road/cx/gravel groupset) when most bikes at this sort of price have Tiagra (two steps up in the range).


&gt;The trails are either paved or packed dirt and sand, or sometimes gravel. (Mostly I avoid the gravel...) 

What terrain you want to avoid depends a lot on what bike you're riding, with the right bike you might suddenly find the gravel way better to ride. The biggest factor in this will be tire width, and I'd look to get a bike that comes with wider tires as stock and has room to fit 40c tires.

Something like the Norco Search, Giant Anyroad, Kona Rove Al or Surly Straggler would all be bikes that should work well for you.",1467331789

but arena does need some fixing. it's not even worth playing around... pretty much anything at this point. since there are so many sets, the likelihood of your opponent actually having a specific card that you are playing around is so small that it's usually (not always, but usually) better to NOT play around anything at all. which removes a significant amount of the skill from arena play.

the obvious thing would be to just limit sets that are available. if you play a limited format in magic (similar to arena format, you have only a few packs worth of cards to build your deck with), they don't just throw every set together. they curate their limited environments and you are supposed to draft specific sets together in specific proportions. it's actually reasonable to try to figure out what your opponent could have if there are only a few sets that they can draft from.",1467331790

The older style is somewhat more 3D:ish while the later is more flattened in it's look i.e. closer to iOS / Android / modern webdesign.

Yosemite (10.10) also introduced a change in color scheme for many controls and the Finder folders (lots of bright blues). Yosemite also introduced blurred (""frosted glass"") transparency in some cases replacing existing transparency effects and adding some new ones like sidebars in apps and more noticeable transparency in menus.

There has also been a trend starting in Lion (10.7) to de-emphazise UI controls, e.g. removing color from the iTunes and Finder sidebars, and making scrollbars grey and hidden (by default). This is supposed to put the app content at the center of the users attention although I'm not sure how this works with the bright blue checkboxes, radiobuttons and dropdown menus introduced in Yosemite (10.10).

Note: the transparency added in Yosemite (10.10) can be disabled so Yosemite (and later) may actually have fewer transparency effects than earlier OS versions when the *disable* is in effect.",1467331791

This is a brief comparison and you'll notice that the section about violence Islam explicitly mandates Jihad and the killing of infidels.  Something that the Bible does not do.  This is an important distinction and why I believe violence among Islamic extremists is so pervasive.  The people of the Crusades were mostly illiterate and could not read their holy book which told them ""thou shall not kill"" and whatnot, but even literate people of today will read that Jihad is mandatory and those who kill non-believers will be rewarded in heaven. 

Education does not stave off the message only active rejection of the book's teaching do that.  If someone truly followed Jesus' teachings to the letter they would be a pacifist.  Fucked up in other ways, but a pacifist.  If someone truly followed Muhammad's teachings to the letter they would kill apostates and infidels.

PRO TIP #1: remember to dismember the bodies of the ghost people or the will get back up 

PRO TIP #2: don't forget to max out on the casino prizes at the Sierra Madre before leaving. Prizes worth about 100,000 caps.

PRO TIP #3: during the final part of dead money when you make it to the vault full of gold and pre war money, take every pile of cash and all the gold bars... you will be over encumbered but that's okay, during the battle walk up to the forcefield near the entrance, crouch next to it and drop the gold bars all at once, if done correctly the gold bars will drop on the other side of the force field. Kill the guy and run all the way back around the way you came in, pick up the gold bars and walk back to the elevator. In total the casino winnings and the gold bars amount to roughly 550,000 caps with max bartering... dead money is a complete waste of time if you skip this IMO.

"actuallesbians","t5_2rch0","I dated someone who came out as genderqueer. I use the word lesbian just because it's easier than saying queer. If I say the word queer when talking to straight people, or even some gay people, it often requires some kind of follow up explanations that I don't necessarily want to go into. But I think the fact that I used the word lesbian to describe myself made my partner feel like I was invalidating their gender identity or something, but at the end of the day, lesbian is just a word. I'm primarily attracted to women, but I can also be attracted to trans and nonbinary people too. Even the occasional femme gay man. Maybe that makes me not an ""actual"" lesbian, but whatever who cares?

Using they them pronouns can be really awkward at first. You never know how someone is going to react. But if it is awkward for you, imagine how awkward it must be for them. To have to ask people to change the way they talk about you all the time and have people tell you that your gender doesn't exist, must be pretty hard for a lot of people. I think the most important thing is to be loving and supportive of the person you are with. All the stuff about identity and technical definitions of words is kind of secondary. Also I have found that when you use the word partner instead of girlfriend, most people (in the U.S) will assume you are gay anyway because it isn't a word that straight people use very much.

Someone pointed a gun at me. 

I called the police and an unmarked car met me and I showed them where it happened (house the suspect came from). 

From the very beginning the lead officer was very aggressive didn't ask if I was ok at any point, asking me why I was there, **'ok but why were you really there'**. I was doing nothing untoward and was in a public place listening to the radio. 

Even pointing out the house was stressful, I felt I was explicitly clear,  it was the only door of that colour. **'OK you need to be clear as I can't keep driving back and fourth'.** 

They dropped me off at my car and told me to wait while armed police did a raid. About an hour passed and they come back. She then grilled me again **'Are you million percent sure?'**

I asked if I could move to somewhere of the main road as I felt exposed and unsafe as the suspect could visibly have left the property which I said, she proceeded to challenge me and fell just short of saying no, so I relented and agreed. 

Few minutes later she comes back **'So why were you really there?'** So I repeated again what I was doing. **I** then had to ask what was happening. 

**'Nothing, there was no one at the property, can you come and make a statement at the station'.**

'How long will that take, I have work in the morning (it was 1am at this time)' 

**'I don't know, so you're refusing to come to the station?'**

'No, I just rather do it another time and not now as I can't commit to being there for hours tonight'. 

**Right, you're free to go then**

At which point I asked for her badge number and she became even more aggressive

**why do you want that? Everything is being recording so I don't know what you're on about**


It's hard to get the tone across. Maybe how she acted was entirely inline with how Police act. Although when I had another incident a few years back I had to kick the Police out my house because they were overly concerned about my well being. She didn't seem to give a shit, and looking back her approach not only made me feel worse but also it was not conducive to helping recall as much information as I can. 

I deal with pressure well, but her approach was dreadful.

-A token with the following:

    Name: Altered Ego
    Mana cost: X2GU (you're not casting this so it's not likely to be relevant, but it is a copied value)
    Type: Creature — Spirit Shapeshifter
    P/T: 1/1

        Flying
        Altered Ego can't be countered. (again irrelevant, but still copied)
        You may have Altered Ego enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.

However, as this creature token enters the battlefield, its replacement effect comes into play - you may have it enter as a copy of a creature on the battlefield, with zero +1/+1 counters on it (cost not paid).

My point is I never said anything about being arrested, only prosecuted and then I relayed the correlation between prosecution and conviction. 

The government doesn't settle criminal charges, in the lay sense. They are either dropped or ""settled"" through guilty pleas (which I will concede may be for a lessor offense). 

And for the third time, I would argue that a criminal charge does almost always equal a conviction of A charge.

Many of them are the first to be displaced or bombed during internal armed conflicts in their ""new"" states of residence, including during the Lebanese Civil War of 1975-1990 and the ongoing Syrian Civil War. Their perpetual exile has meant not only that Israel can deprive them of the right of return but also that they are the first to be screwed out of rights for not belonging to the strict notions of nationalism in other Arab states that grew out of the colonial period. They are also the first to be scapegoated in other states when there is political turmoil, including in Jordan, Egypt, and Syria. The fact that many of them continue to live in ""temporary"" refugee camps, regardless of whom you blame, means that this is not a ""finished"" campaign of colonization like the one the Europeans carried out in the Americas. 

While the aboriginal populations of the USA, Canada, and Australia have been given nominal citizenship in the States that have carried out (arguably) even worse injustices against them, and they are free to move around including in the areas of their prior residence, Palestinian refugees are barred from returning to their former villages and homes. That is not to say that these indigenous peoples in the West are ""doing well"" or something -- in fact, even a short visit to a Native American reservation makes it clear that it is anything but. But the point is, the United States, Canada, and Australia are *completed* settler-colonial projects. They no longer need a standing army to take away basic liberal/constitutional freedoms from the indigenous population. That is not the case for Israel, which still defines the right to hold residence in present-day Israel largely on the basis of race (providing the right of return to Jews anywhere in the world but denying it to Palestinian refugees; and holding dozens of laws on the books that continue to deprive the remaining Palestinian population that gained citizenship in 1966 of equal rights, particularly with regard to land ownership). 

The other problem with your analogy is that Israel is still in what might be called its ""fortress"" stage. That is the stage in which the colony is still using a standing military to take over land. Israel continues annexing land in the Palestinian West Bank using its army, directly violating those provisions of international law that were put forward after World War II to end the Age of Colonialism, particularly Article 49 of the Geneva Conventions and the UN Charter's focus on the doctrine of stable borders. Israel is less like the United States today and more like the United States in 1875 -- it is still in the process of expansion, and with that expansion come all of the injustices of depriving someone of statehood. Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza, unlike their discriminated Palestinian brethren in Israel, who have citizenship, do not have any rights at all. The legal doctrine that the military enforces against West Bank Palestinians is a combination of military law, British Mandatory law (from the colonial era) and Ottoman era law. In contrast, Palestinians and Jews with Israeli citizenship are subject to Israeli civil law, albeit Palestinian citizens are still subject to discrimination under Israeli civil law.

Your analysis also assumes (for no apparent reason) that Canada, the United States, Australia, etc. deserve support and that that support is ""moral"". I do not think that is the case, particularly given that the United States continues to carry out policies throughout the world that most nations consider to be very serious crimes. 

In short, even assuming that support for the United States is valid, the comparison to Israel is not. Israel is not like the United States in 1934, when remaining Native Americans were granted citizenship; it is not like the United States in 1964, when the Civil Rights Act was passed. Israel is like the United States before both of those periods. It is still barring millions of people subject to colonization from the right to return, from the right to movement, and the right to litigate for the return/compensation of their property. Israel is still using a standing army to confiscate more land. And Israel is still using its laws to give racial preference to the colonial population (defined by Israeli law as anyone who is Jewish) while depriving even those Palestinians with citizenship of the same rights. So the comparison is temporally baseless. If you are arguing that countries that engage in colonialism do not deserve support until ""enough time has passed,"" then simply put, not enough time could have passed because Israel is still actively engaging in the ""colonial"" behavior through its laws and policies. The results for Palestinians, particularly those in the West Bank, Gaza, the refugee camps of Syria and Lebanon are particularly obvious.

"fivenightsatfreddys","t5_331ct","*""God* ***FUCKING*** *dammit!""* I yelled, as soon as I got home. ""What the fuck was I thinking?! I'm a fuckin idiot...""

I completely hated myself. He was dead, and it was my fault. *I didn't know that the robot's jaw was gonna break!* I thought to myself. *I thought it would just shut down!*

*What the hell am I gonna do now?! I'm not gonna have a future with something like this!*

*Ugh. I'll just lock all the doors and stay inside for the rest of my life. My parents are never gonna come home. Hell, they probably got to Heaven already, and are preparing to see my little bro.*

""I don't even want to be seen anymore..."" I said to myself as I started walking to my bedroom. I'll just sleep and hope I die. If not I'll do it myself.""

**12:00AM**

I woke in this dark place. Sure as hell wasn't my bedroom, or any place I knew, for that matter - all I saw was darkness, and all I felt was the floor.

After feeling my surroundings, I found a flashlight. I pressed the power button, and after a few flickers, the light turned on. I waved it around the room to check my surroundings.

It was a kid's room. It wasn't my brother's, because it wasn't this big.

I started walking around, looking for a door - I found two. One to the left and to the right. Both had a hallway that turned to the same spot.

I walked out of the room and started walking to the end of the hallway. When I was halfway there, I heard the room door shut behind me. I ran back to open it and check who it was, but no one was there.

I was starting to get a bit scared. I tried calling out some names.

""Oh, ha ha, Jordan,"" calling out one of my friends. ""Very funny. You can come out now.""

Silence. Nothing. I heard a few laughs though.

""Uh, whoever that was, you can stop hiding...""

*""Oh, but what's the fun in revealing myself?""* said some demonic, otherworldly voice. *""Besides, it's not like you ever stopped hiding when I told you to come out.""*

The other door swung open. Behind it was a big, yellow monster wearing a purple hat and bow tie. It reminded me of that robot from Fredbear's.

I was generally terrified at this point. This wasn't real life, this **thing** wasn't real, right?!

""This is all a dream, r-right? I'll only just wake up when you come catch me..."" I stammered. Sweat started pouring down my face.

*""This isn't a dream. This is a nightmare, buddy. But this isn't yours, this nightmare belonged to someone you held close. Now that he's gone, we've decided to go to* ***you.""***

""O-oh, really? Come at me, then! I-I'm not scared!"" I turned on the flashlight, but the battery died soon after.

*""Silly little boy... You really aren't prepared for what's coming to you...""*

The monster leaped towards me.",1467331810

Formative assessments, know what your children know and bump them to the next level. Math and spelling are the easiest places to start, then writing, then reading. Reading is very hard to teach correctly. 

Literacy instruction would be my next preference, if students can't read, that impacts several other disciplines. 

Group work and project based learning is years down the road. Please don't push those for years. It'll lead to failure for new teachers every time. 

Forming student relationships is not necessary. Two entities existing in the same room for five hours a day for 180 days will have a relationship. If you care, they'll see it. They'll see who you are. Treat them respect and be authentic to who you are, do things for them and help them when they need it and everything is great. ",1467331811

Spinning. Spinning again and again. No stopping. I can't. Ever since this company bought me, I've only been able to spin. I couldn't stop, and that's just all I wanted to do. The eternal buzz emitted from me was maddening. Who wouldn't go mad if they only listened to themselves though? Other fans don't have to go through this. Then again other fans aren't possessed. Maybe, I don't know. I continually thought, maybe if the place closed down, then maybe, just *maybe*, I could have sweet relief and stop my nightmare.  But I slowly realized that wasn't going to happen anytime soon. Freddy Fazbear's Pizza was one of the most popular restaurants in the damned country. **So I had to take action**.

The place was about to close. I had been waiting, and it was finally time. I ""seduced"" five children back into the Safe room, the perfect place for a murder inside this restaurant. Once I had them all in, I proceeded to remove the grill protecting people from my cold, heartless, *spinning* blades. I cut into them, slicing their skin, their meat and blood flying across the room. Fazbear's won't be able to survive this! I kept doing it until they were nothing but a mangled mess of flesh, cracked bones, and an assortment of organs from an array of four different children. Then there was only one left.

She stood in the corner, quivering. I approached her, tearing running down her face. Picture perfect, I thought to myself. I sliced her throat first, and listened to her gurgled screams of pure terror, screams of a person knowing they would die. Slowly she stopped, until she screamed no more. She collapsed on the floor, dying in a pool of her and other people's blood. Just then, the door opened. Someone was wearing the Spring Bonnie suit. They walked in and closed the door.

""Even if it was just this one last time, I'm glad I could don the mantle of Spring Bonnie. I doubt they're going to use these suits again, heh.""

Just as his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he realized that there was a myriad of dead corpses in front of him. He gasped in horror, being careful to not set off the springlocks however.

""What happened here? Who would do this? And why wasn't it me? If anyone was to kill these brats, it should be me."" He paused, ""Then again I don't really want to be mistaken for the guy who did this, so...""

He took off the costume and dashed away, and I took part as well. I went back to the office, and slid back in my spot on the desk. Having already put on my grill, no one would suspect me. Not a little old fan.

_______________________
~40 Years Later
_______________________

It's been years since I killed those children. *Decades* even. They reopened this place after a few years, but it didn't last. No one would go to it, not after all the tragedies that had befell it.  I didn't have to spin. Not anymore. Eventually I'd fall apart, and go to my Happiest Day. Little did I know those dreams would be dashed in just a few seconds. The door to the restaurant flew open. I had heard it open before after the closing, but all that came my way were those blasted animatronics that time. This time however, I heard a voice.

""Dude, like look at this place! It's like the real Freddy's dude!""

It was... an adult. It sounded like he was with someone. Grave robbers maybe? Well, my eventually grave. I heard footsteps come my way. He was coming towards me! What could I do? Before I even had any time to formulate a plan, however, the figure came through the doorway.

""Hey, it's one of those old fans! Man, this will make the place look *really* vintage!""

Of course. Now I'm in their ""attraction"" based off those old ""unsolved mysteries."" It's a bit enlightening to know what really happened, I guess. *Something* to be happy about. Doesn't matter however, as I was spinning yet again.

 Maybe... No, it could never... Well, I could if I just... Those wires certainly don't look like they're safe...

Maybe I could set the place on fire? I could certainly give it a shot.",1467331812

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","This is a fairly even fight.  Both are medium to close-range fighters, and while Heavy has the better damage with his minigun (Not at Bastion's level, but close), Roadhog has his hook, which can pull Heavy into Roadhog's range, and away from Medic, or pull Medic in and kill him.

Team TF2's best bet will be to stay at range, dodging Roadhog's hooks and keeping a constant beam of damage on him.  Depending on the details of the battle, Heavy may have to lay off on the minigun in order to find ammo, which would give Roadhog a chance to heal up, putting them back at square one.

I'd leave it at 7-10 Team Overwatch.  Roadhog may have less range, but his hook could easily pull away Medic, leaving Heavy unable to heal.  Even without it, he can play defensively, keeping line of sight to a minimum while trying to hook and or ambush Team TF2.  The deciding factor is how much the minigun  would do when translated into Overwatch stats, or vice-versa with Roadhog.",1467331812

"ZeroEscape","t5_2w69i","lets see it another way then. Espers appeared because of the impending doom where all humankind would die. Because of bootstrap paradox (multiverse version) 2 people that shouldnt even exist are sent to the past. One of them becomes the leader of Free the Soul, and probably with the help of her sister he manages to see how the timelines manifest and forsees the horrible future, so he spends his lfie searching for the path that would benefit msot people. Now an important matter about the many choice elading to different timelines is that even in those infinite choices there are things you cant acomplish, even if you go for the best choices, there is only so much one can do alone, but what if you have more than one, what about 2 or 3. Now remember that constant use of esper powers give you more contorl over it, Akane was probably the first one other than Brother to ""master"" her power, so now she has a more controlled access to the multiverse, but as Akane said in the ending of VLR, even with her there is only so much she can do. She needs more people to open up more choices and possibilities but she doesnt have much time, setting another game in the gap between the events of 999 and ZTD is probably imposible with her current selection of choices, so she aims to train someone in the future. The elected persons ahve to be powerful espers and havce to experience detah many time to control their power so that more choices open up again. Eventually we end up with Akane, Sigma and Phi who can now control their power and go on with the plan. Carlos was self trained sicne he was in constant danger and while characters like Junpei and Diana had little to no experience, it was enough for them to have so many espers around to resonate and accelerate the process. A path finally opened to a brighter future but it depended on a lot of jumping around, it is jsut the way it is, it also ended up trigerring the birth of Brother in the past so it neded up as a bootstrap paradox.

Hmm now that i think about it, he only mentions that a religious fanatic ends up killing everyone, it is never stated to what faction he belongs, it may not have anything to do with Free the Soul, so in a wierd meta sense, the snail saved 2 billion people in some universe just by existing?",1467331812

My main advice would be to make sure you're honest about any 'downsides' to the place - ours was on Balmoral Road which obviously gets pretty busy with traffic and although we mentioned it, people said we should've had made it more clear that the sound of traffic was quite significant in the morning. A lot of it is obviously based on reviews so you want people to enjoy it as much as possible and as long as they're made aware of short-comings in advance then they were perfectly happy. There's no such thing as too much information on the listing, and put a little personality into it.

Depending on your location, price will be important, particularly as it's a lot busier now. Be sure to price it competitively and modifying it over time if you find you're getting too few/many enquiries. When I first listed, I had it too cheap and had 2-3 enquiries overlapping nearly every day for a month. Be sure to use the day/week/monthly pricing feature as best you can - a lot of people who are travelling to areas for work will now try AirBnB instead of a hotel and take advantage of longer term stays. Be willing to negotiate a little on price, most people will try it on, but set yourself a minimum and don't go below that as it needs to be worth your time.

Also, make sure your insurance covers it - often you can just add a little something to your premium and you should be fully covered for issues/damage they cause.

If you have any specific questions, happy to answer but that's my main takeaways from the experience. There's some good extra $$ in it if you do it well, highly recommend it.",1467331813

Me, a layman with fair mechanical knowledge and ability and a basic understanding of ICEs. Where did you come up with 5,000 miles? Was it based on any science, or is it an educated guess that's somewhere in the middle of the rule of thumb from 1950's engine technology (3k miles/3months) and the manufacturers service industry. 

Them: A company that has manufactured ICE's for 50+ years, and has multimillion dollar budgets for Engineering, Research, Development, and testing. Not only that, but they have 50+ years of engineering research, development, testing, and IP information at their disposal. They also designed and tested the engine in question, and have all the R&amp;D data available to them to determine the optimum oil change interval for that engine. 

Seeing as the engineers who determined the maintenance intervals probably a) know more than me about how oil degrades with use in an engine, and b) know more about the engine design, and automotive engineering than I do. 

I'm going to take an educated guess that they know more about the subject than I do, and I'm going to take their word. Using your logic, why should I trust you (random internet forum guy) over the engineers that designed, tested, and built the engine in my car? ",1467331814

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Perhaps, but the problem with your idea is that it takes two ""attacks"" to shove + grapple.  By giving the owner of the grapple feat restraint on grappling they only have to expend one attack.  The are free to use any extra attacks they have to then attack the restrained target which they are at advantage to hit anyway.

I might remove the 0 speed clause for the grappler, but I think changing the feat to simply restrain on a successful grapple is more effective.  Remember that in the shove + grapple option any ranged PCs are going to be firing at the creature with disadvantage because they are prone.  Restraining the creature does not impose this disadvantage because they aren't prone, but gives the entire party advantage to hit.  I think restraint is thus better than prone for the whole group.",1467331816

Winning or losing, you don't split up unless you still have a numbers advantage after splitting.  You see a team do this, and you send all 5 to one and get a 5v2 or 5v3 wipe, and then you leave one at the temple and 4v2 or 4v3 wipe them at the other temple. You see your teammates try this, and you ask them which temple, and get them grouped.  Remember that the first team to start the temple is at a disadvantage because they are stuck inside the temple, and they have guardians fighting them.

&gt; Basically, if you are winning, you don't really have to fight. You get to PICK your fights. Don't pick stupid ones, like 3 v 5 in the mid-lane while your healer is backing for mana. Why would you do that??? Don't chase them halfway across the map into their obvious bait. Please!

I find this dismissiveness of the leave voters that people have to be very troubling.

None have been forged since the doom of Valyria.  With only Jon and the North aware of the White Walker threat I just cannot see how we could get any number of them forged without a serious time passage. 

Sam would be the one is my guess to whom will figure out how to  forge it through the Citadel, but how do you make a half a million or more weapons in time to do good. The again how do you build a thousand ships fast enough to play a role.

"writing","t5_2qh2n","You clearly have never been a slush reader. And yes, I'm dead serious.

Let me repeat: **we are reading to reject**. The pro magazines all read up to (and sometimes over) 1,000 submissions a month. Submitting a ""great"" story riddled with technical errors isn't quirky, or irrelevant, or ""not a big deal."" It is literally being disrespectful of the editors' time. It is saying, ""Polishing this was not important to me. You deal with it."" If your story isn't important enough to *you* to make it as good and as polished as possible, why should it be important enough to *me* to recommend it?

Another thing is this: volunteer or not, I put my reputation on the line a little each time I recommend a story. Pro mags usually have an audition process for the *volunteer position* of slush reader for a reason: the editors don't want to deal with a preponderance of crap. The slush reader's job is literally quality control. I don't want the editors to rethink hiring me as a slush reader because I passed up a story riddled with errors--something they would never publish.

Moreover, due to the way stasis works, you will face him next turn when your squad has all its action points back. Please read the entire thread before commenting next time.

As for the stun-proc opening, I said I only use it sometimes. Mostly I do it it situations where I can afford to be economical. If I have a reasonable certainty that I can easily best a pod, I will use it instead of an item with limited uses or an ability with a cooldown. If it works it can outright trivialize the fight, and if it doesn't nothing else will really change much about my subsequent approach.

As for you point on cover...
A) not all cover can be destroyed
B) items/abilities that destroy cover arn't always available/judicious to use.
C) not all enemies need cover to make shooting at them with a shotgun at moderate range difficult.

For being able to engage enemies at a longer range and attack far more enemies than the shotgun build could ever hope to do, yes I consider the ""slight"" decrease in close range damage acceptable.

Half steps (agree:  silly to think of it in terms of ""frets"") are assigned a value of one and then added, yeah?  

On the one hand I think this is kind of interesting -- surely some composition student would have a ton of fun annoying professors and performers alike writing out scores and parts like this.  

On the other hand I don't understand the point:  you still need to include the rhythms, unlike guitar tabs....  Why not add another line on the staff and put some notes in there?  Tabs are for people who can't read music...and 90% of that is reading rhythms.   Not clear what is gained here...

Anyway.  Violin tabs:  mind blown.  Is this a common thing now?  Guaranteed upvote to first person posting link to second section of paganini 15 tabs.     Thanks for the explainer, Bazzage.

"MonsterHunter","t5_2rron","- ""Regular roll""/""vanilla roll"" vs Aerial hops: When side stepping, you will do vanilla roll like guild/striker. When hit and recovering with rolls, you will do vanilla rolls if you press B immediately. When you press B from idle, you will initiate the aerial hop animation. When sheathed, same applies- idle -&gt; direction + B = aerial hop &amp; If recovering after attack when sheathed, vanilla roll.


- Yes you can change direction *after* kicking monster/player/bomb etc. in order to get into a better position for counter attack. For motion values of attacks on ground/in air, check Gaijinhunter's latest tutorials. He shows all motion values with the animations on screen. Treat the aerial attacks/charges as separate motions than regular ones.


- Aerial Hammer double aerial pounding: Yes. You need to press A 1x earlier than you may think to land the 1st hit (and proc second).

____________

Bonus: I encourage you to practice and master [aerial invulnerability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFb5Fvx0_5M) . If used properly, it can be your ""second bushido style"" so to speak. I-frames are between peak of hop to just before landing on ground.

I personally find Khepri incredibly mind-numbing to play.

I do not know how to further investigate these statistics I'm unsure of where you were able to get more details to negate the claim that it was purely based on hetero sex. 

Furthermore, I personally have trouble believing these statistics granted it is littered over every website that is seemingly credible. It just seems like such an experiment is so unavailable and results unattainable. You're telling me volunteers couples where one person was clean of HIV willingly went at it until the disease was caught. And that if that was the case they observed such a high number of sexual acts? 

Again, I agree I have some anxiety over the issue. I actually got my test results back and they were negative via the blood draw @ 28 days later and I feel the same as before more than relieved mainly cause I probably had nothing to worry about in the first place...... But how can you fault me for asking a question about something where EVERY fucking response is just don't worry about it, it's so unlikely according to the CDC here let me relink you the same site that has been said 10000 times before that you've already seen. No one has been able to give me a detailed answer as to why and I can't seem to find out more information on the studies and details of the transmission risk. I'd like to know more, specifically I'd like to know more about minor factors and how they play into the risk, I'd like to know more about how the studies were actually conducted. I've failed to find those answers on my own searches so I was curious if anyone here could help me. Still have not had any luck. 

You allegedly have higher learning in this field no? Even my question above you are unable to answer me why the cdc estimator jumps from 4 to 11 for vaginal to anal if its only for penetration. You instead said oh those stats aren't entirely vanilla something must be missing, so how do I know the numbers mean anything?

He went back to Ashemark. To rescue Damon and my mother. And our child."" Tears were in her eyes. She didn't even know if he had succeeded. ""I haven't heard from him since, but Leyton sent out word of my abduction shortly after he left. I saw the letter myself. My brother and mother must still be alive.

African-American is just some shitty PC buzzword. I think its more offensive honestly, if I was black id rather just be called fucking black, or black american. 

I mean, look at those kneejerking PC asswipes, they use drawn out shit like ""Person of Color"" yeah lets just not even give any recognition of their actual race? I mean fuck, its just 2 words more away from straight up ""colored"" which is a really shitty term.

Basically Americans race issues(aside from straight up racists) seems to be created by the same people who think they are being ""progressive"" about it. All new terms, and groups and buzzwords to split even more people up. At least this day and age.

Death squads (often composed of police officers) were widely used to rape, torture and kill street children in Brazil. Businesses even paid to have street kids murdered. This has gone on for decades and even though there have been recent reforms, much of that was undone by the World Cup - death squads again operated with impunity.

Historically, there even are cases where children were openly killed by police in cold blood in front of churches.

"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","So a little note first, Geisha and Queen of Hearts both come standard in a plunge cut. The balcony cut I believe is just for the unlined bras. Any padded bra can be made in the any of their padded bra cuts (plunge, 2HC and 3HC). Within the plunges, there is a little bit of variation with some being cut a bit deeper or shallower than others, but most are just a standard plunge. The 2HC is a 2 part halfcup, and its the shallower of the two halfcups. The 3HC is a three part halfcup, and its three part construction allows for more immediate projection. I'm not FOB, so I can't really help much in terms of picking out a style.

Sizing is a little tricky. In general, a UK 28 band is equal an EU 60 band, and a UK 30 band is equal to an EU 65 band. In general, Comexim bands run a bit tight (and there seems to be a lot more inconsistencies in the sub 30 bands, so they sometimes run a lot tighter than you'd expect). However, a lot of people have been receiving bands that are more true to size (or even a bit large) in the more recent orders. So your options are either to get a 60 band and risk needing to wear an extender or get a 65 band and risk having it too large (the inconsistencies make it a bit hard to give a solid recommendation).

As far as cup size goes, counting cup sizes would put a UK GG about equal to an EU J and a UK H about equal to an EU K. However, as mentioned below they use different cup increments so people sometimes need to size up. Some people wind up needing to size up more than others, but for a reference point I wear about a UK J cup and generally wear a Comexim N cup (though counting cup sizes would give me an M cup).

I'd say that a 60K or a 65J might be good starting places, depending on what you want for the band. One thing that you might consider trying would be buying one secondhand off of Bratabase (if you use it) or /r/braswap if any pop up in those sizes. It's nice to get to know if the band runs true to size before you buy it.",1467331851

"Warhammer","t5_2qqd4","&gt; How do I know what to buy in order to create my army? What units?

Seeing as how you are just getting into Warhammer, I would highly recommend buying one of the Start Collecting! kits if your desired team has one. The Start Collecting! kits contain a nice selection of units and are generally a very good starting point for any army.

As for something more specific, this would depend greatly on what specific game you decide to play. I'm assuming you are more interested in the fantasy side of Warhammer seeing as you mentioned it a few times in your question, so the answers below will be focused on that.

&gt;My guess is that there are some rules about % of units or whatever an army can have. How can I find that?

Army compositions only matter for 2 of the ways to play fantasy Warhammer. The third option known as Open Play for Age of Sigmar has no army composition rules allowing you to take whatever you want (even from completely different teams) simply because you like the model, have a specific theme for your army, etc. The army composition rules for the first 2 ways of playing fantasy Warhammer would be found in the following:

* The main rule book for 8th Edition Warhammer Fantasy.
* The main rule ""book"" for The Ninth Age (community made 9th edition of Warhammer Fantasy) which can be found [here](http://pdf.the-ninth-age.com/pdf/the-ninth-age_rules_1-0-0.pdf).
* The General's Handbook for the Match Play version of Age of Sigmar (not released yet but soon to be released).

&gt;Once I know that, how can I know what units are what type?

This would most likely be found out by looking up a unit in the team's specific army book (possibly called a codex) for your desired team.

&gt;Do different rules ( 8th, 9th, age of sigmar...) need different army compositions?

For the most part the army composition for the games requiring it would probably look similar (more room for weaker infantry with restrictions on war machines/monsters/heroes). Some units might have a different type in one system compared to another.",1467331852

"news","t5_2qh3l","Am I the only female who doesn't like to swim with men sometimes for non religious reasons? 

 I mean I am not a man hater or anything sometimes it just feels awkward to be in a pool packed with men.  Being a former lifeguard encounters I had with some stupid teenage boys made me really just not want to swim with them.  Now before I get jumped on, I know that these boys aren't a majority and it's not like every time I go to the pool some boy is gonna ruin my time.  

It's just some of the time I don't want that added stress in the back of my mind thinking maybe I will get harassed.  Harassment does happen in pools and being a lifeguard I have had to stop it way too many times.  I don't expect anyone to make special accommodations for me to swim with girls only so I go at odd hours when it is likely I will be alone.  This isn't to say girls don't do that same abusive treatment towards boys or to girls either I just haven't witnessed it.  

I am gonna keep going with this rant and say for these muslim girls this must be a very hard transition for them.  It is hard enough being someone raised to believe bikinis are appropriate attire in front of men to actually wear one to the pool.  These girls are raised to believe they are property and if they do anything to make a man desire them they will be taken advantage of.  They are simply trying to stop that from happening. They have a victim blaming society if they get harassed or raped they truly believe they will be blamed and possibly turned out of their families as a best case scenario. 

 All of the rage towards immigrant boys and men attacking women is incredibly being ignored when the modesty of these women pop up.  I am ashamed Reddit has been so casual about how we need to understand these boys yet the girls should be denied citizen ship because they don't want to be vulnerable around these same boys media has been demonizing since they started moving into all of these western countries.  The hypocrisy is ridiculous.  Why is anyone applauding Switzerland for making an already difficult transition even harder.  No one even needs to swim to be a citizen it is a no issue in the first place.  Why are we trying to understand men and not giving teenage and preteen girls the same consideration given to full grown men attacking these same girls?",1467331852

Absolutely. As Kenneth Folk says, in noting ""everything goes in the hopper"", and as the old saying goes, ""it's all grist for the mill"". It's especially important to note apparently profound experiences and the reactions the mind has to them.

&gt; And for daily mindfulness, how often should I note what is going on?

As often as you reasonably can. It can be tricky to find the balance in the vagaries of daily life, but if you're doing your best, you're doing just fine. Don't strain or try too hard; strive instead for a natural balance that allows for changes depending on the needs of the moment. It's pretty hard to note while you're having a conversation with someone, but pretty easy while you're standing around waiting in line.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","Hmm, I guess I would take that back and not say it wasn't ""complete"", just as a listening experience from front to back Chinese Democracy has a level of consistency that UYI lacks I suppose. 

Songs like ""Perfect Crime"" and ""Shotgun Blues"" while not bad and epic in their own way feel like incomplete B-sides that somehow made the cut. Songs like ""Right next door to hell"" and ""Back off Bitch"" feel kinda lazy with the chorus consisting of Axl screaming the title a'la AC/DC (not saying AC/DC is bad, I love them too it just doesn't feel right coming from GnR). 

Add in to the fact that in general with UYI I it feels like there was a concerted effort to feature Matt Sorum's drums  and in UYI II Dizzy Reed's keyboard which while not sounding bad just generally made the tracks all a bit repetitive in nature. 

Contrast that with Chinese Democracy, listening to each song is its own trip ranging from your ""standard"" in your face title track to strange but cool in its own way ""Shackler's Revenge"" and ""Scraped"". Axl also really pushes his voice to its limits in CD, something that I appreciate. The production on CD is also quite top notch. ""Sorry"" is just freakin eargasmic to listen to.  Going in you know as a perfectionist he spent all of those 8 years poring over every note, backing track etc. so it just kinda adds that extra meaning to each song that each was his baby so to speak. 

It's got its own headscratchers (to me) like ""Madagascar"" which I guess Axl being Axl he's gotta have have a track like that in there but even then it is quite an excellent experience to listen to front to back. Idk I'm a big stickler for an album as a whole work not just picking out the good singles which is why The Wall by Pink Floyd is also just my idol. Just mah 2 cents :). ",1467331856

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","In all likehood, the average pay of journalists has probably gone up; IIRC most early journalists were freelance and paid by article 'bought' by the editor - an arrangement most folks nowadays would look on as either mildly exploitative or 'disruptive and innovative' depending who's doing the buying.  

My understanding is that the modern 'news media' industry, from Buzzfeed through to The Economist, is generally more profitable collectively, but things are getting tighter for individual publications.  For the journalists themselves, it very much depends on the institution they work for and their relative seniority and placement.  Add on that a larger goal of many journalists seems to be accumulating a large and credible enough body of work for a book or similar publication deal, I think journalism is more financially promising than ever before, if still a terrible wager compared to many other more predictable and higher base-rate career paths.  

But I did tangent my answer a touch, OP's suggestion that journalists were struggling to make money, hence the clickbait-y shit, was reversing cart and horse a little to my understanding of how news media approaches content/structure/tone audience targeting.  It's that the market those publications are aimed at doesn't mind clickbait bullshit, and putting clickbait bullshit on the content their audience wants is a way of better monetising the exact same final product compared to more conventional headlines or presentation formats.  

And of course, neither OP nor I are trying to frame a world where good content doesn't exist.  

Part of what all the rambling through the link was about was that the large amount of '*bad*' content OP was pointing out as potentially symptomatic of the decline of Journalism is seen as 'good' content to a different audiences' eye.  The sheer range of targeted groups, and the ways to target them, means that there's *tons* of media produced entirely for audiences that aren't us and a lot of that media looks pretty terrible when we assess it by our own standards.

Chopper is an animal that ate the human human fruit, so there can't be a crocodile that has one too. He also was in the water, so it wasn't a human with a Zoan devil fruit ability.

Then there are the fishmen, which a crocodile does not fit as a species, so it can't be a Fishman.

I am not saying you should rule her out of marriage or motherly material yet, because of clairification on her age, this makes a lot more sense.

Basically objectively science speak, true long term planning linked with present responsibility has not fully developed in the human brain until 25. It was easier for her to fantasize without expectation, and then when it became real she saw all that it was. No to say a dog is overwhelming but that she has not started in that phase of her life yet where a dog lives up to 20 years and suddenly her life now operates to someone else's routine and relies on her. 

This does not mean for the rest of her life she will be incapable, it just means she's too young to think about other living beings relying on her life to exist with theirs. It means right NOW she would be a crappy parent, meanwhile you are having an easier time because your brain has reached that phase of development and passed it to where you can efficiently juggle those things.

Adults do have development phases, and it's easy to forget that. I'm not saying every 24 year old is a crappy parent either, because some people develop faster than others, but it sounds like she's apprehensive because it really legitimately was unexpected. Day dreaming is different than doing.

It would make sense why she doesn't know how to explain it to you either, if she came out and said 'I didn't realize how much of my life would be sacrificed for this responsibility' then the whole relationship is drawn in to question for something she can't help.

I know, it's just a dog, but a phase of life that has not been developed anyway. After everything you've told me, perhaps it is best to give the dog back and wait for her to grow up just a little bit more. A few months to another year and she will have grown a bit more to be capable of setting aside a part of herself to be able to do this.

This is the same reason people generally frown on people getting married or having kids too young because they haven't developed enough to make room.

I hope this helps and calms you a bit. Sorry about my advice before but clairifying the ages fit better. If she's 26 or over and displays this behavior then I would default back to my first advice.",1467331861

"smashbros","t5_2qiep","I know you can go to the crazy hand subreddit to get more information on these match ups, but I can share some tips only on the DDD MU.

 Always try to hit the gordo back to DDD as it gives him a harder time and limits his use of Gordo. Try to find the best move in your characters kit that will easily hit the gordos back. You also want to try not to play super aggressive or super greedy against DDD. He is very good at punishing greedy players. 

When DDD is recovering, he my try to hit you from under the ledge with up air, so make sure to watch out for that move, because it will create some space when he is recovering back on stage. Gordos can also be used by the DDD player when recovering, bur hitting them back to him will cut off some of options.

DDD's back air is an extremely good move that you must play around, or else it sill become very difficult to avoid and punish DDD. It is extremely difficult to punish it when it is properly spaced on shield, so try not to always rush in with a dash grab or DDD will punish you for being to greedy. Another thing i noticed DDD's like to do is float and burn jumps in the air to bait you into approaching and then hit you witn a falling bair. You canbhit DDD out of the air, or just wait for him to land so you can punish.

My last tip is to watch out for neutral b. It is a pretty decent move to tomahawk shields and is also a suicide move whenever DDD want to take you to the pits of hell with him. He may use this when he is a stock above and wants to suicide you, so be careful when going offstagetro edge-guard him.

Hope this helps!",1467331864

"Eesti","t5_2rffn","&gt; First time you mention that this is in respect to direct democracy, plus you gave an unconvincing explanation.  
  
I consider direct democracy to be the purest form of democracy, thus it becomes an etalon.  
In respect to the etalon of democracy, ""representative democracy"" is an oxymoron.  
  
&gt; My point was rather (and I could have elaborated) that the electorate was very small.  
  
It was ALL the citizens / shareholders / soldiers.  
  
&gt; That indeed, however you need to take into consideration the complexity of our modern lives and the vast number of issues that need legislation.  
  
That complexity has to be simplified by several orders of magnitude.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt;spinoza

Spinoza is nice and all, but you need to dig deeper for a good variety of solid content. The best pantheism is diving headlong into process theism. With some spinoza and paul tillich on the side. And then for a scientific angle read schrodinger's book, as well as some information about what led him and some of the people of his time to think what they did. Schrodinger admits that he's not a philosoper by trade, but later philosopher daniel kolak argues for the same things he did, and said that we need to take seriously the scientific intuitions that led them to do so. Read some daniel kolak, with schopenhauer as an intro. And for added context Eric Schwitzgebel's paper about the united states, and some panpsychist texts, since historically it was presumed to lead to pantheism. And of course read classical stoic texts for an understanding of the overlap between pantheism and the individual.

Then if you're still hungry read some tielhard de chardin. Obviously he is totally bonkers, and what he is saying is not literally true. But its an interesting perspective to consider even so. And then a philosopher named quentin meillassoux has an interesting archetypal way to understand the type of thing chardin says. One that somewhat resembles hegel. (Too bad his full book isn't available for purchase yet).

But yeah. Pantheism is a good idea ruined by hippies. Which is why its better to use a synonym for it instead. Charles hartshorne made a more obscure term for it called surrelativism, to focus on the supremely relative as surpassing the merely absolute. And one can also use tillich's term transtheism.",1467331864

Foreigner friendly ice hockey team in Ibaraki/Tokyo

&gt; Hello everyone, first time poster here (apologies if I am not doing something right)
&gt; 
&gt; I am currently living and studying in Tsukuba since April this year. I brought all of my ice hockey gear with me (minus the sticks) when I arrived in the hope that I will be able to play in the Tsukuba Uni Ice hockey team or at least be allowed to practice with them. Long story short, the uni team wont even allow me practice with them. 
&gt; I've been ice skating for some time now and trying to play some ice hockey for a year and a half before I came here. (Beginner to Intermediate lvl). I would like to continue practicing and improving my ice hockey skills. I did find a expat team called the tokyo canadiens, but have not emailed them, because they are way out of my league.
&gt; I speak limited Japanese (between N5 and N4, I understand more than I can speak). Is anyone here a ice hockey player that can advise me? I would be in your debt truly.
&gt; 
&gt; TL:DR - Looking for a ice hockey team in Ibaraki/Tokyo that has foreigners in it/or is foreigner friendly.
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you in advance.

There will also be some who find *any* contemplation within a novel, a longer view, authorial voice, thematic resonance, to be 'pretentious', a getting away from the story. And they are, of course, entitled to feel that, since we all have different *needs* in art. (And our needs change, too.)

But your last bit is really interesting. I have argued that artists who send their work into the world need an essential arrogance in one specific way: they need to be able to feel 'what I have to say is worth people's time!' With all the doubt and anxiety attendant upon the creative process, I do think this has to be there at some core level as one works.

Modelez is really saying that it's worth $107/share to them, but it's not worth that to a financial buyer (e.g., you or me). The potential synergies from combining Hershey with Mondelez, plus the value of Hershey's cash flows is really what they are valuing. 

Sure, you can make the argument that it's worth as much as the highest bidder will pay for it, but that only holds true in the long term if there is eventually a sale. If you are buying based on chance of a sale, it starts to look a little like speculation.

You're not wrong, but I don't think the intrinsic value of Hershey is necessarily hugely increased just because somebody made a tender offer. I guess it all depends if you believe in the likelihood of an eventual sale.",1467331882

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","The reason why people are buying overseas, is because they are getting ripped off with prices that are double, sometimes triple of what you would pay overseas. And it is obvious too. We all know that businesses who make special offers every two weeks with 30 to 60% OFF store wide, are still making money on those sales. If you pay full price for anything in New Zealand you clearly have too much money.

That people boycotting NZ retailers for their horrendous prices for products that are made in China, should tell them something. But no, let's cry about those bad customers buying overseas, instead of changing the way they do business. 

Forcing 15% GST on people who are buying overseas will not change a thing. I am pretty sure that many things I have bought overseas in the past would still be cheaper with the 15% GST on top. In 50% of the case I wouldn't have gotten the products in NZ anyways.

we still fight with corruption - but its getting better despite recent events - because every even slight fuck up which could led to corruption is very often medialized and people are very vocal about it, also EU directives help with it - still its bad i think as many politicians are known to be corrupted and nothing is really happening with them

also average length of czech government is 3 years and we have periodically repeating winners of the election - left/right with sligthly prevailing left wing - also its worth noting that there never was a party in czech parliament with more then 35% - which means that  parties never made one colored government /please correct me fellow czechs if i am wrong

basically, politicians have to make political crisis so they can fight for votes

If someone wants to be a decker then tell them they'd better know the relevant rules backwards and forwards. If they want to run a spellcaster they need to know the magic rules. 

The GM should have a familiarity with most of the rulesets but they shouldn't need to know *everything*.

It talks about the design behind flags, and the ""rules of flag design."" 

But what it really shows is how the principles which make for a good flag can be applied to design in general, especially for things like logos and crests. Things like meaningful symbolism, simplicity, and striking layout and color.

Here's the deal about traditions - THEY CHANGE ALL THE TIME.

Constantly. Christmas used to be just another holy mass, on far less important than easter. Now it's a huge mess of intermangled traditions. 

Tradition is not constant, nor necessarily right. When it is, or benign, or helpful, than keep it. But just because my grandfather was a member of the Klu Klux Klan and thought blacks were subhumans doesn't mean I should give any consideration to those backwards ideas.

What are you going to remember in those final days before they throw you into a box to rot for eternity? Your year-long journey across the globe or a fucking promotion?

Yes, taking a year off will set you back a bit - and don't listen to anyone who tells you it won't.

Do you need to be pragmatic about your finances and future? Yes.

But shit man, humans lived and died without 401Ks for 30,000 years.

You won't regret traveling...you'll have to work a little extra hard to play catch up and then you'll have this extraordinary year to look back on forever.

If you don't mind a quick critique, here's what I think would have improved your photo:

* Somewhere between f/8 or f/11 to capture the full depth of field.
* ISO 100-400
* Manually focus to about 1 mile out. If your camera allows you to magnify the viewfinder then I'd focus until the buildings in town were sharp.
* You can play around with the shutter speed here. A slow shutter speed would help keep noise to a minimum. A fast shutter speed would improve sharpness in the trees if it was windy that day. If you're shooting RAW, it's ok if the shot is slightly underexposed as you can recover the details in post.

[Here's a shot I took with a comparable camera](https://www.flickr.com/photos/robotninjacat/27375408993/in/datetaken-public/). This one was actually shot with a monopod. I tucked in my elbows and pressed the shutter button at the end of my exhale just to be safe.",1467331904

I was thinking of explaining the exact mechanics behind it, but that'd probably bore you.  Therefore, complete the following steps:

1) Destroy all Nether portals in the Nether from (-35,x,-35) to (35,x,35).

2) Create and activate Nether portals at (32,x,32), (-32,x,32), (-32,x,-32) and (32,x,-32).

3) Check to confirm all other portals in the 70x70 area are still destroyed (a new one could be created by a player walking through a still-active portal in the Overworld while building in step 2).

Every player that tries to enter the Nether from spawn will enter through one of these four portals, because they cover the four extremes of the spawn area. It additionally covers between 8 to 1024 blocks past spawn, but it depends on other portals outside the cleared radius in the Nether.

Even with a draw distance of 2 chunks, one player could stand at (0,x,0) and see who spawns from where.",1467331904

Angry Terrain - You should use her normal wisdom spell DC (8 + prof mod + wis mod) I think. That way she only has a single DC to track.

Tactical Retreat - Seems good. Would be cool if he returned at the start of his next turn, kind of like the spell Blink, instead of seemingly instantly. One thing that bothers me is the 1d6 + CON, I'd consider changing to + Fighter Level (like Second Wind!) in order to give it a bit more scaling.

Soul Missile - Again, I'd use his regular Wisdom spell DC, no need to create another DC to keep track of. Otherwise very cool spell.

Mind Meld - Advantage on all attacks for 10 minutes seems insanely good, especially since it doesn't require concentration. 

Point Blank - I don't like the ""focuses on you"" downside. It's not really a downside most of the time, since the enemy approaching the Gunslinger already wants to hurt the Gunslinger in my mind. The downside of missing an attack should be that the attack missed and you used your reaction for it, I don't think there's a need for that added clause.",1467331905

I had friends move to Milton because that was the only place you could find reasonably priced real estate.

So what happened after that big boom?  Not much that I recall.  A sustained levelling off followed by a long term cooling off or something similiarly non-dramatic?  A sustained new status quo?  I'm not sure that this has to end in a big kaboom.

It's not lousy storytelling. Just because you have trouble putting two and two together to understand things presented before you in a film doesn't mean the storytelling is bad, it means you're bad at comprehending it.

No, but you're giving extremes that don't compare in any way, shape or form. I get it, you don't like the movie, you couldn't understand it so you think it's shit.

It's a bit of a yes/no thing for me. Could I have started on a 650? Yes. I respected the bike enough.

However, I did drop the 250, multiple times when I first got it. At least three times. Once in rain in a round about, as well as dropping it while moving it around. Not from being reckless with the throttle and clutch.

I am glad I started on a cheap 250. Drops (not crashes) didn't hurt the value as much and when I got the 650 I had learned how to handle a bike and how to keep it clean.

Basically my opinion is that you can, but the added advantage of smaller bikes is that they're cheaper and you don't cause as costly financial damage by ruining them. You're out $2-3k after not putting oil in it or something else stupid, that sucks but it won't hurt nearly as bad as blowing $5k and up.",1467331906

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","I think Aang just has more displays, but as a couple people have said, Korra has done things Aang hasn't as well.  Blocking spirit beams for one which is pretty ridiculous and the weird giant astral projection she made of herself to fight Vaatu, something Aang never did (though he might have been able to, I feel like Aang would have handled the Harmonic convergence event much better than Korra personally).

But she did lose the connection to her past lives so her Avatar state is basically just a big power boost instead of the combined knowledge of all the avatars ever.  So it definitely takes a hit in that regard.  However she is closer to Raava and has that personal connection as Waan had so she get's a potential boost from that.   Not to mention when you see her form when she fights Zaheer she is also poisoned and quickly dying.  Which would likely make her state that much weaker over time.

When she activates it consciously it is basically the same boost as it always was for Aang, he uses it that way at the end of the series and when he removed the power from Yakone.  So it's essentially equal for them in that regard. ",1467331909

"SandersForPresident","t5_2zbq7","&gt;You have a lot of right-wing talking points for being a proponent of social democracy. Since r/IAmRoot did a pretty good job of retorting some of your points I will try to be brief.

I have arguments against socialism because that's why I'm a social democrat, not a a socialist. Any social democratic will argue their positions the same way. We only occupy the same community right now because the U.S. is so to the right. In Europe we'd be in different parties arguing against each other all the time, about as much as the Green party argues against the Democrats.

&gt;&gt; I'm a social democrat.

&gt;Firstly, the only reason why high taxes are needed to fund social welfare programs is because social democracy is treating the inevitable symptom of economic disease that is capitalism: wealth inequality. For an owner to profit, they must take some portion of the fruits of the labor of the workers. Repeat this process iteratively and there becomes a divide in those who have capital and those who don't. Once there is this divide, those who have capital (capitalist class) buy up resources and reality to make money by charging others for access. This forces the working class into contract with the capitalist class out of survival and have no means of dictating what wage remuneration they receive other than by collective bargaining. If the capitalist class becomes powerful enough, they have the means whether by direct action or by enhancement and utilization of the state to manipulate the markets to their benefit and oppress workers by offshoring their jobs, collectively offering lower and lower wage rates, breaking up worker solidarity, and a host of other tactics. This is crony capitalism which is borne as a result of the natural tendency of capitalism.

That's like saying democracy is treating the inevitable societial disease: anarchy and chaos. (Think Libya.)

If we give up democracy yes, that will happen, but that's why we shouldn't give up democracy, and why we have systems in place to prevent that.

There's no need to throw the baby out with the bath water.

&gt;&gt; If someone didn't like working at a startup they can get another job elsewhere.

&gt;So why don't they just go get another job which pays better? Well, due to the reasons above, the median wage of workers have been stagnant for 35 years while production has increased at a linear rate. Go look it up. Basically, workers are receiving less and less portion of the fruits of their labor because they have no power and the owners dictate what wage they receive. It doesn't matter if you get a job else where; they pay the same which is effectively less than what was paid in the past after adjusting for inflation.

I'm not arguing against this, but I don't think the solution is to revert back to the stone age. Capitalism got us here for a reason, because it works for the most part. There's deep problems with it, just like democracy (the famous Winston Churchill quote), but we can fix those.

&gt;&gt; I believe capitalism because it promotes innovation and risk taking

&gt;Did you know most of the significant innovation of the past century occurred in the public sector or was funded by government subsidies. Exxon Mobil gets over $4 billion a year for R&amp;D even though they make billions in profit every year. They are not taking risk nor are they innovating. Our tax money is doing that. This also makes the assumption that worker owned cooperatives are incapable of promoting innovation which is not true. In revolutionary Catalonia, the worker owned cooperatives actually increased production by about 50% to 75%. They became innovative and more efficient. Capitalism is actually killing the innovation of people because they put highly educated individuals into jobs which require them to often do small pieces of the production process which are unskilled, mundane, and repetitive. The owners can pay less for this type of work. 

Why the heck are you equating production with innovation? They are basically the opposite of one another because you have to stop production and efficiency to be innovative. I have no doubt cooperatives are productive, *that's the problem*. It's a very basic system that excels at what it does but doesn't innovate, there are no good systems in place to do that, I don't see how it can work well without a monetary system, see my other reply.

Also, you can't draw a line with one point, like I said I don't see why cooperatives wouldn't be more productive, but how people correspond under a modern socialist society is something else entirely.

&gt;&gt; No need to force everyone to be your Guinea pigs.

&gt;I am a libertarian socialist so I don't want to force you to do anything you don't want to do. If you would like to start a privately owned business or work at one, that is perfectly fine. Just don't use the government to skew the market and create barriers for other businesses to compete. 

I thought you were for government research? I recognize the need for government to regulate monopolies and such. Of course, the less regulation the better though.

I'm really really against a socialist society with no money. If your kind of socialism has private and worker owned businesses competing for customer's money, then maybe we aren't too far off, I'd like to analyze how that would work.

&gt;&gt; doing work for less than they deserve for the job... Once these people leave

&gt;In actuality, the prospect of being an owner in a business and having democratic control over your work brings in excellent talent. My friend who just got a PhD in Structural Engineering just took a job with a company because of the worker ownership and workplace democracy. He also now has a self interest vested in the company and if he and his coworkers work diligently out of their own self interests, they will personally benefit and reap much greater rewards than if they had just received salary.

I don't claim to have all the answers, but I would like to see it tested more on a mass scale.

&gt;&gt; I don't think they work on a mass scale.

&gt;I agree with you partially. This is why cooperatives would likely have to be organized into federations to achieve a corporate model's size. Although, there are some examples of large cooperatives out there, like Mondragon.

&gt;I see below you said you don't see a better solution. This is the reason why there is not more cooperatives out there. Many people don't even know there is another way to do things. There are many rural energy cooperatives in republican country and they don't even know that is socialism and they like their energy cooperatives because they have control over them and they get money back. They simply think the state interfering in economic matters is socialism. I suggest you allow for a greater vision and exploration of how things would run in a society with worker owned businesses. You limit your thoughts based on talking points which have been feed to you. There is no reason why a democratic council of workers whose decisions about how they invest would directly impact their lives would not be careful about where they put their money. Have you ever had thought about why you think that and some of the other assumptions made in your post? 

I came up with all of these points on my own from experience and walking through in my mind how it would work. I do know about the tyranny of the majority and I've seen enough in my life to know this is true, simply put, I would rather put my trust in someone I know is trustworthy rather than the mob. I like the idea of an elected board of directors, so I can see that working a lot possibly.

I tell right-wing libertarians and socialists the same thing, go test it and prove that if works first. I know in my mind, in theory, I see problems with it, but I'd love to be proven wrong.

They are also talented into as much AoE as possible when they don't need to be:

* Just stick with UM over Ice Nova. If you are doing the rotation properly, you don't have many spare GCD's to be casting ice nova. Plus you have an enhance shaman, arms warrior, combat rogue, 2 DKs, and 3 hunters. Mages don't need to spec into this, especially since you are lacking on ST damage to close out the fight
* Thermal Void is better than Comet storm. The only thing that CmS does is proc PoF multiple times, but as I showed above, you shouldn't be using PoF as frost. With all the procs you get from T18, you will extend the duration of Icy Veins by over 20 seconds each time it us used.
* They need to be taking Greater Invisibility instead of Cauterize. They need GI to drop the chains cast if it targets them when Evanesce is on CD. ",1467331914

No, she's not.  She has a steroid that you have to knock yourself up for, and a steroid that only gets good when you dash out of a knockup for it.

Her 2 and 4 are simple, but that's about it.

&gt; Also, Ajax's gods don't use the copying things all the time like Fish's does, and even if they did, they all end up working in a different way, something that is clearly not present at Fish's gods, like (specially) Raijin for example.

.... Really, you have no idea how the hell programming or game design in general works if you keep bringing this up as a point.  It makes no sense whatsoever.

Early iterations will always pull other code as temp.  You want a leap that ends in a CC?  Pull Anhur jump's code and that DB entry over.  Oh, the build just happened?  Guess what'll be datamined:  Oh it's the new god with Anhur's jump!  How unoriginal!  Even though it could turn out to be completely a different ability in the end.

All you're learning by seeing entries like that is that his work schedule tends to line his DB work up with when they split the live build.  Did you see when Jing Wei was being made?  She had Rama's roll tech, Freya's banish, medusa's viper shots and vulcan bombs.  If the build had happened as they were making those entries, datamining would have picked up, ""New god, Jing Wei, Ability 1: Banish, Ability 2: Viper Shot, Ability 3: Rolling Assault, Ability 4: Magma Bomb.""

Would she be SOOOO unoriginal now?  No, because using datamined info makes no fucking sense.",1467331914
