Independentemente do sexo ou orientação sexual, é possível ter amizades sem segundas intenções.

Porém, ainda é possível que venham pessoas que tentem se propor como seus ''amigos'', mas tem a intenção só de te comer eventualmente. Estas pessoas ao menos (geralmente) são  relativamente fáceis reconhecer, elas tentarão sugerir massivamente um momento picante entre você e ela, ou serem as primeiras a te ajudarem a ''desabafar'' após um término. Geralmente, se você as recusa, elas vão embora.

Mas também existem amizades que a pessoa têm a genuína intenção de ser seu amigo, mas por um acaso do destino, ela termina se apaixonando por você ou passar a simplesmente desejá-lo sexualmente. Em compensação, estes tendem a ser mais honestos sobre, ou fingirão não sentir nada porque não querem perder o laço de amizade, ou independentemente da reação, é possível que mesmo após uma confissão, continuem tentando manter sua amizade (mas tem outros que se constrangem tanto que fogem).

O ruim é que como não lemos mentes, você não sabe que tipo de amizade você está lidando. Basicamente você vai ter que mergulhar fundo nisso e tentar a sorte, já que é basicamente uma aposta.",1727740800.0

"3Dprinting","t5_2rk5q","So I'm thinking of another budget printer in the $200 - $250 CAD price range.

I have one A1 mini, and it's excellent, but I'm also curious about the ELEGOO Neptune 3 ($202), and Ender 3 V3 SE ($229) compared to another A1 mini ($249).

The A1 mini is so incredible at the bottom end of the market at that price point, can anything else even touch it? Yes it lacks a bit of build volume.

How good are Ender 3 V3 SE's specifically? Those are the two I can walk in a store and buy. One for $230, one for $250, the other ELEGOO can be shipped to my door for free for $202 but really, 20 bucks difference for the Ender 3? 

My old Ender 3, I've thought about upgrading, but the new one seems like it has most of those mods ... touch probe, nicer bed surface, I'm assuming better extruder, dual z axis, auto bed leveling, faster printing. Is it reliable? Do prints just work on the V3 SE? What about the ELEGOO printers?",1727740800.0

\* ANC is mostly good. It occasionally tweaks out for a second. Not sure what specific sound profile makes it do it, but it like abruptly drastically changes the sound for a split second before settling back. Not often, but often enough that it's not a one-off

\* These are the most comfortable buds I've ever worn; obviously, everyone's ears are different, but the only time I've had discomfort was accidentally falling asleep with them in (so they were in my ears for about 7 hours then; and, yes, my left ear, specifically, was on fire...probably because that's the side I fell asleep on); otherwise I've worn them listening for up to 5 hours without wanting to scream

\* Incredibly annoying bug, that's apparently been around in one form or another from the first Buds based off google searches, where if I have it connected to one device with Youtube, and another device with Youtube, and try to play Youtube on the second device, it just instantly pauses and won't play. Unlike some of the other old bug rage threads about this, this is very specifically when I have my BP2s connected to my Fire TV and any other device. Haven't had this issue with any other combination of two devices, so far (which are any combo of windows pc, chromebook, pixel 9 phone). And, unlike some of the resolutions given in old bug threads, ie: close Youtube completely on one device, I can completely force quit Youtube on the Fire TV and still can't get Youtube to play on a second device. The only thing that works is to simply not use my BP2s with the Fire TV.

\* Sound is very, in my furthest from an audiophile opinion, neutral. I'm mostly fine with that. If I had to hazard a guess, if you are a bass-head, you should probably look elsewhere.

\* I REALLY don't get Gemini on earbuds. If I ask Gemini a question, she/he'll will often vocalize parts of the answer while leaving the rest as text on my phone...and it's so odd why it doesn't just vocalize the entire text on the phone. Often enough to be largely useless as far as I'm concerned. And, to be clear, Gemini NEVER does this if I don't have the BP2s connected and just play Gemini voice through my phone speaker. It vocalizes everything then. lol

\* And, of course, the most important bit: BP2s in Peony are gorgeous. I wish the Pixel 9's Peony was this vibrant, rather than being lighter pink.",1727740801.0

"AskSerbia","t5_2z4yb","Imam nekoliko. U tom smislu sam jako bogat covek i pitam se cime sam to zasluzio. Ne uzimam zdravo za gotovo. Prijateljstva moraju da se gaje da bi cvetala a ne uvenula.

1. Porodica. Imam suprugu koja mi je zaista prijatelj. Popickaramo se cesto ali neka granica se ne prelazi. Zaista radimo zajedno ka zajednickom cilju, blagostanju nase dece.
Sa roditeljima sam u sjajnim odnosima. Ne znam sta ne bi uradili za mene.

2. Jedan prijatelj iz najranijeg detinjstva. Njegovi I moji su bili prijatelji, isto smo godiste, tako da se znamo oduvek. Nismo uvek bili naj naj ali negde tokom gimnazijskih dana smo nekako kliknuli. Mnogo toga smo preturili zajedno. I dobrog i loseg. Ako bi mi se nesto strasno desilo, posle zene, prvo bih njega pozvao u pomoc. Moja zena ga bas ne mirise previse, ali nema problem sto sam ja s njim blizak. Sa njim je uvek zabavno.

3. Jedna prijateljica iz osnovne skole. Zajedno smo sedeli u klupi. Opet... zaista smi kliknuli negde u gimnaziji. Imali smo zaista sulude faze. Bilo je i varnica. Mrzeo sam neke njene frajere, I ona moje ribe. Sa nekim njenim momcima sam bio super ortak. Na neku cudnu foru, ona i moja zena su postale super drugarice. Sad smo kumovi. Cesto letujemo ili zimujemo zajedno. Zaista kao porodica.

4. Drugar iz gimnazije a posle i sa faxa. Imali smo bend zajedno, isli na more i skijanje zajedno tokom gimnazije i faxa, izlazili, jurili ribe zajedno. Prvi put se nasljemali zajedno. Ma svasta nesto ""prvi put"" smo uradili zajedno. Malo smo odrasli drugaciji. On je ozbiljan, smiren, mudar. Bavi se sobom i fizicki i duhovno. Jako sposoban i uspesan, ali se cesto vidjamo i uvek ima vremena za mene. Kada bi mi trebao savet za nesto vazno, nesto sto zahteva mudrost, nesto od nekoga ko mi ne bi sudio i bio 100% iskren, ko me istinski poznaje, sa njim bih razgovarao.",1727740801.0

Value by definition implies hierarchy. A fast runner is superior to a slower one. A strong person is superior to a weaker one. A smart person is superior to a stupider one. This is true regardless of any “ism” you fallaciously try to strawman into the discussion.

If I’m assembling a team of elite weightlifters, and I choose all white males, it is not racism, classism, or sexism. It is called operating within the confines of objective reality. 

Is there a bias? No shit, Sherlock. Reality is biased. I already explained that with crystal clarity. But it’s not a ‘bias’ based on ‘bigotry’ as you seem to misappropriate the term to push your idiotic agenda.

"StardewValleyMods","t5_itqx7","No, you're fine, I was just checking they were gone. OK. Let me run through the process for modding as I understand it on a Mac, so we know that we're on the same page with that. 

1. Download mod from Nexus (or wherever).

2. Double click the zip file in the download location to extract the contents into the download location. (It looks like you've been putting the zip file into your mods folder and extracting it there, which should actually be fine for first installs on most mods, but don't do updates that way in the future unless you've entirely deleted the old copy of the mod *before* putting your new zip file in there. Otherwise, you'll end up overwriting files in old mods rather than replacing the mod entirely, which can cause problems with big updates. But for right now, it's fine, just make sure to delete the zip file once you've extracted the mod from it.) If you choose to extract directly in your mods folder, ignore this next bit that I'll put in parentheses...
""Locate the unpacked mod and click and drag-drop it into your mods folder whilst holding down the command button on your keyboard.""

3. Go back to the Nexus page for the mod and check on the main tab for a drop-down menu labelled ""Requirements."" Click it to drop down the list, and make sure you've downloaded and installed all mods listed there under the heading ""Nexus requirements."" 

I would advise at this stage, because you don't have many mods installed, that you delete all mods from your mods folder *except* the four listed on your smapi log that we know are working. Then redownload and install them using the above method, run your game, and see if they load in. If they don't, generate a new smapi log for me and come back here with a link to that so we can have a rethink.",1727740802.0

"Biohackers","t5_2vnoe","I find them more palatable than psyllium husk, but some folks do get really weirded out by the texture.  

If you mix a spoonful into water and let it sit 5-10 min, they’ll create an almost solid gel that you can practically eat with a spoon.  But if the gel bothers you, you can dump them in the water and drink it straight away, before the gel has time to form.  Still slightly odd but more like drinking poppy seeds than swallowing tapioca. 

You can also put them in your smoothies, oatmeal, etc. Be prepared to floss if you eat them in something solid, rather than drinking them! Lil buggers get everywhere.",1727740802.0

I'm not angry at her.  She could not help it anymore than I could.  So I'm at the acceptance stage with KR and have learned many masking skills over the decades so can be successful, at least by schizoid standards.
The masking helps me adjust but doesn't change who I really am.
Therapy, in my opinion, can help you gain acceptance and assist with learning masking skills.  But you will still be the same you.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","I think another factor is the DH penalty and how it should be applied to Ohtani during his two way player years. Should it be applied on the days he doesn’t pitch but hits? But the only reason he’s not playing defense is because he plays the most important defensive role every five days. Should he be actively punished for that by accruing negative defensive WAR? But then what about just pitchers? Should they be punished for not playing four of five days, since they don’t add any value to their team in these days?

Also, what about days he does pitch? Is he considered a DH on these days, or a pitcher who hits? If it’s the latter, then why is it not applied to the other days when he’s not a pitcher, and he accrues negative defensive WAR as a DH and not as a hitting pitcher?

This is one of the reasons I believe the DH penalty and other defensive penalties for playing at a specific position like 1B should be erased, and normalized so a DH accrues 0 dWAR. But this is one of the reasons I can think that WAR doesn’t account for Ohtani properly",1727740802.0

Slowly, your feed was curated by the algorithm to show more ""engaging"" content - the most enshitifying being stuff that makes you angry so you comment & share.

"bloxfruits","t5_2epu8u","Hello, thank you for trading in r/bloxfruits.
We've had an increase in the amount of scammers in the subreddit lately, so here are some tips on how to avoid getting scammed.

1. Never go first in a trade, scammers often say they'll give you a perm after you've traded them your items.
2. Double check any links you click on, scammers will often try and trick you into clicking a phishing link with various excuses.
3. The safest way to trade is adding the other player, asking them to join you or double checking that you're joining a bloxfruits server, and 
never doing a trade where you aren't being given what you asked for in one trade.

If you have any questions, are unsure about a trade or would like more tips to prevent being scammed, send a modmail and we'll assist you.

The last room was filthy neglected. As a monk i was appalled at the sloppy maintenance and immediately grabbed a broom and started cleaning. Apparently that was the trick to pass the trial, and once my group noticed i wasn't there anymore they also started cleaning.

As you said in your own post, a board like the Alchemist encourages you to ride it hard and fast, that's where it really shines, and if you don't have the skill set to really bomb hills, the alchemist is gonna give you a false sense of confidence with how stable and smooth it'll feel at speed, so what happens is when you do eat it (everyone does, it's part of learning) you're gonna eat it BIG which is what sounds like happened to you. Not saying it's a guarantee but I'd be willing to bet if you had been on a more beginner focused board, you could have spent a lot less time learning how to ride around the board and it wouldn't give you that false confidence to ride beyond your skill level. At the end of the day tho you get to decide how you want to learn, and for some people getting that intermediate-advanced level board won't impact them enough to worry about it. Hope you aren't too injured for next season, rest up brother, sounds like you progressed a lot regardless of if the confidence was ""earned"" or not",1727740804.0

Defender is a perfectly fine product. 

Downside is that you can typically get better margins on third party solutions than with licensing for M365, so evaluate how much revenue you’ll lose. 

You’ll also have to deal with MS support more, so your resolution times may increase for clients. And you may lose a single-pane-of-glass if that’s what you and your staff like to see. 

Your experience may vary, and your underlying business operations may vary. I think incorporating elements of what you want with your clients can be a win for them and you.",1727740804.0

And yes, I know we would be able to get by in English, and I'm sincerely grateful for that -- and for a few years, I'll probably need it, since I'm normally pretty bad at languages. But you nailed why we're trying to learn anyway: it seems only respectful to the community we're entering to do our best to learn their language rather than demand that they use mine, even though they already all *can* use mine. And anyway, I want to reach the point someday of feeling as if we belong there. Using English will only set us apart. I'll use it for now because I have to, but I'm going to try and do what I can to reach the point where I can get by in Dutch... even if my accent still sounds ridiculous to the Dutch while I'm doing it. 😉

"BaldursGate3","t5_12967t","Hey, can I check if you're using BG3mm. Are you saving the load and exporting it to the game? 

- go into internal mod manager and go to installed, tick all your mods on if they're off. It might be if they're not on there it's having a hissy fit?

- usually I only get this maybe on the first load of a new save, it shouldn't be turning them off every time. The odd mod yes, as for me trips and main ui always turn off annoyingly but I usually leave them off. 

I would suggest maybe deleting modsettings to give BG3mm a fresh start as well (see below)




 1. Modsettings.lsx: 
 Go to : \Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Larian Studios\Baldur's Gate 3\PlayerProfiles\Public\modsettings.lsx delete modsettings.lsx (Don't worry it'll make a new one when launched) this just refreshes the bg3mm settings completely, so make sure its gone.) . 




 2.Only if its there in your files - Delete worldtooltips.lsx (cant remember where exactly it is) think data game follow it through to world tooltips. Again will make a new one. 


5. Launch bg3 to menu then quit, should make new files for it. 


 (Optional:) 6. In BG3mm go to settings - prefrances - script extender - make sure admin control is ticked (technically crossed) - select creat consol. This creates a command window when the game is launched that can help show you what's crashing the game and any warnings (doesn't always but pretty handy)

Timelines are fine, there was *never* a chance of stopping covid from spreading, or evolving.  The vaccine could not be produced fast enough, or delivered to enough people fast enough, to make any difference.  Omicron was believed to come from somewhere in North Africa/Middle East, where there were notoriously no vaccines availabe.  Not to mention it was also believed to have developed in some type of rodent, like mice.  In essence, you're saying that if only we could have vaccinated everyone, everywhere, and all the animals, we could have stopped it.  That's a literal impossibility, and not even worth a debate.  We were faced with one of the most infectious diseases ever studied, that appeared to have no problem jumping species.  There was no amount of policy intervention, at any level, that could have stopped it.  Even believing anything like that was remotely possible is plain old hubris; thinking that somehow humans have controlled mother nature.",1727740805.0

Apart from that, Ewing's (Eddie) plot is quite fun and interesting, Ram's is very bad and insipid, I think he didn't understand Dylan very well, and on top of that, it's repetitive with what Cates told, there's no real development or journey. Hitch's art is horrible, he's at his worst, and the glory days of his Ultimates are gone. I think he made the most horrible design of a symbiote, on top of that, he draws Eddie as hegemonic, and the worst thing is that he gives him a very hipster look, and now all the artists, because of him, follow that same Eddie design, it's horrible.

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","Ok,

So, here is my opinion about dreaming. 

They can be divided into 7 different reasons::

""1. Prophetic dreams. These are impressed on our memory by the Higher Self, and are generally plain and clear: either a voice heard or the coming event foreseen.

2. Allegorical dreams, or hazy glimpses of realities caught by the brain and distorted by our fancy. These are generally only half true.

3. Dreams sent by adepts, good or bad, by mesmerisers, or by the thoughts of very powerful minds bent on making us do their will.

4. Retrospective; dreams of events belonging to past incarnations.

5. Warning dreams for others who are unable to be impressed themselves.

6. Confused dreams, the causes of which have been discussed above.

7. Dreams which are mere fancies and chaotic pictures, owing to digestion, some mental trouble, or such-like external cause. """,1727740805.0

Makeup isn't a bad thing. BUT banning makeup from the house or creating unnecessary tension around makeup will make her resent you and your husband.

"economicCollapse","t5_2qn15","Using natural disasters as proof of a climate emergency is not very honest. 


Hurricanes in South Florida cost more in damages now than 10 years ago because there is a lot more developed areas and population density has increased. Same as everywhere else. 


If a storm is headed towards a coastal area and has the possibility to hit one of two cities. The first City A, has a potential for 100 million in damages and the other City B, has the potential for 1 billion. If it hits city B and does 1 billion in damages is that an indicator of the strength of the storm? Partially, but building codes, inspectors, and population density are also important in the monetary damages caused by storms. The economic costs of a storm is not an indicator of a climate crisis without accounting for population density and dollar bills purchasing power. 


The purchasing power of the dollar bill has been significantly eroded over the last decade, even if population and development density hadn’t increased the dollar amount would have increased because the dollar bill has lower purchasing power than 10-15-20 years ago. The same storm hitting city A in 1970 and hitting it in 2024, assuming zero change in population and development would have a higher dollar amount than 1970.",1727740806.0

Anyway after that the player basically did what the robber in the video did and went up to them and took the card back saying ""They can't get mad at me"" and signed them.

"newworldgame","t5_3gmxe","For some reason you seem to be super against PC players. Otherwise it makes no sense for console only. I’m a PC “vet” w/ 900 hours and I feel like I’m going into the game blind because I don’t remember much from the game since I stopped. Not all of us are elitist tool bags. 

One thing I would challenge from your post is about server transfers saying there is 0 downside. You said “You can not however transfer to a console only server from a crossplay server.”. What if a console only character can only transfer to console only servers? No where in the FAQ provides clarity on either side. Are console only characters locked to console only servers and crossplay characters locked to crossplay only servers? We don’t know but that’s not really a risk worth taking imo. The game will live longer pulling from all 3 possible platforms. 

What if 2 months down the road your pc or ps5 player friend decides hey you convinced me to play! Lets play! “Awh we can’t because I’m on Xbox and can only play with Xbox people”. Now you have to make a new character to play together. Just set yourselves up for success on crossplay. Simple.",1727740807.0

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

 Please read all the rules before engaging in this sub. We're adults here, so communicate, please!

2. The humidity should be 80 and having a closed top enclosure helps to maintain this (also temp is 80 as well in Fahrenheit). Again this is until they’re two years old.

"marriageadvice","t5_2r6wv","I’ll be really honest - I don’t know many women in my generation who ‘try’ with their in laws and I don’t get it. I’m a woman myself - and my mom always told me - ‘you’re not just marrying the man, you’re marrying his family, so you better like his family or it’s going to be rough.’ I took this to heart, and love my husband’s family and he loves mine. We call each other’s parents ‘mom and dad’ (while his were still alive - now it’s just his brother.) While they aren’t perfect - and we’ve definitely had our tensions with my BIL and SIL - at the end of the day, they’re well meaning people and it’s my husband’s only brother. It’s very important to ME that he keeps that relationship going and that we do things/ show up for our niece and nephew. So I’ve let things go that most women wouldn’t - simply because anyone else’s family isn’t that important to them - and to me - family is everything. 

Sounds like your wife probably never tried much from the beginning but things just worked because your family over compensated in the relationship. 

This is a tough one - because she will have to want to change and have to want to care - and come to those conclusions and make the effort because she wants to……and I’m sorry but after 13 years - I don’t see that happening. 

I’d suggest therapy so that you can be heard and maybe get to the root as to why she doesn’t care to have much of a relationship with them. Maybe it is something she can work through. 

But if you want to stay married for all other purposes - this unfortunately might be an issue forever. It’s hard to force people to care when they don’t naturally see the bigger picture and are okay with it being that way. It puts you in a shit position - I’m sorry.",1727740808.0

I know that's obviously not your intention, your heart's in the right place, but that's likely how it will come off because she's tied so much of herself into this and an attack on the subject is gonna feel like an attack on her. 

Sometimes, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie. She already essentially agrees with your position, she just believes that Kamala is less likely to approve of legislation harming trans people than Trump, which is pretty inarguably true. 

This is a personal choice, you don't need to ""win"" this argument and neither does she. Just let it be, after the election happens you'll be able to have far more productive discussions than trying to force the issue now when she's got so many emotions tied up in it.",1727740808.0

You could search marketplace for other tree listings and see what others are doing.

If there aren't enough listings to establish a ""commonplace"" baseline then you could put something like ""Buyer must use licensed arborist to move the tree"" and if you don't get any bites you could always edit the listing to remove that later, or to change it to something like ""will split cost of hiring an arborist to remove it 50/50"" or whatever you decide you want to try in order to get responses coming in.",1727740809.0

"weatherfactory","t5_3fmuc","I second your point on Powers being dead Principles. It struck me when I went back to replay the Ghoul DLC, as you're bringing back the lost colors of the dead hours on the Palest Painting, many of them sound like they could have correspondences to the Powers. 

The Endless Memory says this: ""There is a Wheel that only turns beneath the Moon, where once it turned beneath the Sun. But why only one? Why only two?"" This is decisively Moon-central, and the color scheme also largely matches this. When painting a Luxorious Memory, the message is ""the colors tidal,"" much more closely related to the color of moon, ""In a night-blue Mansus-haze swims a coral palace-crown. At its fore-edge it absorbs the lesser Names, coating them with its minerals and juices, and at its rear edge it expels some of them, polished like jewels. The others go to feed its thorny Tide-heart.""

Furious memory says this: ""Long after the cause for rage has passed, the rage endures. Here is a memory of a wrong done before ever iron was tamed."" with scarred bone fragment further elaborating, ""Within this fragment lie memories of an older Hour."" The color being a brownish-tan, the color of Scale, and we know that in the Lithomancy, it was the Colonel that slew the Seven Coils, the central Hour seemingly associated with Scale, during the Lithomachy (though, there was some implications that made me think the Seven Coils' heads each held a Principle that is now dead, their influence given over to Edge and Knock). 

Honeyed memory: ""When we walked in the ways of the wood we were winged and watchful, and we had no need of nectar."" Wildering Memory, the shade of green that is Nectar, says ""Sometimes we remember what was lost even when we have forgotten that it is gone."" It comes from consuming Holiest Hemolymph which says the following: ""Faint traces of an enigmatic substance spilt in the commission of an ancient crime, tightly sealed in a glass ampoule. 'Who will remember the barber's son?'"" This seemingly comes from the Moth's taking over of The Wheel during the Lithomachy, which is why Moth has a seemingly heavy association with the Moth principle - occurring in many of the same books and skills (though grail and heart also take a similar role to moth in this) and many of the Moth names seem to have an association, likewise, with nectar. 

When painting the Splendid Memory, the title is The Colors that Were, and the message, ""Auroral rose vies with electric blue. There is neither night nor morning but only the hours of noon anticipated and lingering noon. We each of us open our hearts to the golden needle of the sky. All colours magnified beneath the Sun-in-Splendour."" Might the Sun in Splendor be the origin of Sky and Rose?",1727740809.0

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","No, but selling shares shouldn't be too hard.

You need a broker to sell shares.

No idea how woolies would have set it up, but you may not have a broker yet, or at least may not have a low cost broker.

The shares themselves should be registered with link market services where you could probably sell the shares but would have hefty brokerage fees (maybe $50) and be a PITA to deal with.

Stake is probably the cheapest broker to sell shares at $3 a trade I think.  Should be able to move your shares to stake and sell them.

From those bids, you will either be assigned a trip, an on call block of 12 hours that you do from home, or an on call block of 4 or 6 hours that you do at the airport. You won’t really have much of a schedule for a while! This is why it’s important to factor in things other than potential flying into your base picks. While you may get a cool trip every once in a while, odds are, you’re going to be flying a lot of the junk that other people don’t really want (short layovers, very early reports, etc.) When I was picking bases, I factored in public transit (I don’t own a car and didn’t want to buy one), proximity to family, and what I had heard about managers and vibes of the crews I would work with.",1727740811.0

This criticism doesn't make a lick of sense to me. Be annoyed, sure, you've got that right that they've diverted away from your favoured choice but its not dumbed down because it has changed.

"JamesBond","t5_2rsg9","Overall, NTTD is just mediocre. It isn't any worse than QoS or Spectre. The problem is that, in killing Bond, it asserts itself as something more important and that arrogance is what makes it so hated.

I'm not convinced that killing Bond would ever be the right choice for a Bond movie but if you are going to do it, you absolutely have to earn it. The Craig movies and NTTD specifically did not earn it.

Craig's run was rocky. The previous 4 movies alternated good and bad with Specre somehow managing to fuck up having Christoph Waltz play Blofeld and revealing that his entire secret criminal empire and Bond's career as 007 was all just about some childhood grudge.

This was not a strong place to start for NTTD. Other than Bond's depression and repeated attenpts to quit, there was no groundwork laid for his demise. A family had to be abruptly shoehorned in to give Bond something he would die for but the audience had no reason to be invested in the fates of these characters. 

Then you have things so blatantly written to railroad Bond into sacrificing himself. The worst was Q looking at thus totally new nanobot/virus thing for a total of about 5 minutes andbl confidently declaring that it is totally impossible to remove it once someone is infected. 

A Bond movie also needs a strong villain. For them to get the better of Bond, even posthumously, this is especially true. Safin was a weak villain, with a poorly-defined scheme and petty motivations. It is totally unbelievable that he is the one to finally put Bond in a situation he cannot escape.",1727740812.0

He also has two bolters operated by an auspex servitor skull thing, similar to Techmarines, Dor Garadon and Iron Father Feirros. It’s only 2 bolted shots nothing crazy.

His melee is stored up heat unleashed in like a shotgun similar to a melta but without being a melta but it’s effectively just a normalish melee weapon with nothing much.

His abilities are a once per battle attached units and him get to shoot again with an additional -1 AP, a bonus to shooting skill on overwatch and allowing him as a Lone Operative to overwatch for free with just his bolters. He also provides Ignore Cover. Has a 4+ invuln and that’s all. I based him off other chapter master models and other things in points and balance.

He doesn’t have a feel no pain, has poor movement and I have tested him against intercessors and he faired fine, didnt seem particularly strong and I made him quite expensive at 175 points.

"theflash","t5_2tzdy","CW Barry is better than he is in most comics and take a lot from wally. Barry was a bland character before he died, he had the personality of Captain America. Wally was the flash that brought a lot of the traits associated with the character and had the best comic runs because he’s a lot more interesting as a character. And no they did go “Let’s just make him faster than Barry” he earned it in a way no other character in comics ever has, he was a lot slower and battled a mental block of surpassing his mentor. Wally is a redeemed character. He was originally a player, cocky, and sometimes annoying and readers got to watch him grow and blend those traits with maturity. Wally is the one who discovered the speed force. Wally has the two best flash runs in history. Barry has what I would say is the third best which is the Williamson run. Even then the best arch’s of that run are the ones Wally shows up for (perfect storm and flash war). It makes sense Wally is faster, he’s more experienced and he enjoys it and wants it more. Wally has had speed since he was 10 and had to go 30 years worth of comics with Barry being dead. Of course he’s Faster he’s THE FLASH. The most popular adaptation of the flash is the Justice league show which is WALLY. Yes many causals when they think of the Flash they think of Barry Allen bc that name got more spotlight but all the traits associated with the character come from Wally West. The people that get annoyed with Wally being faster don’t make any sense bc the argument always is “BARRY WAS FIRST”. Which is just mad disrespectful to Jay. Barry is a legacy character too, Wally is just a better one. Not trynna dog on Barry he is a great mentor and icon just not a better character and it makes perfect sense.",1727740812.0

I feel as if maybe in India, there is no reason to report your buddy dead. Its just a different culture…

Just see how often these dudes record each other dying right… then they post it online for us to somehow obtain and post here… do you realize that??

Again its a different culture, here (assuming youre in the US aswell, haha) if I recorded my buddy messing around near tracks, and he foolishly somehow found a way to die to a train, the LAST thing I would do is post it online, thats fuckin’ terrible…

Classes are great, but ongoing practice and coaching is the way to improve.  I also suggest encouraging them to record their personal practice presentations so that they can listen to the umms and other filler words

If a PC's patron, deity, etc is motivated to help the antagonist of the campaign, that means the PC's motivations are to help the antagonists. The only exception is if the player is in the know and the intent is to cast off their former patron/beliefs to oppose them.

The problem with one character going off script to help the antagonists is that it splits the party and makes your life much harder. The best way to deal with this is to make the PC an NPC if they do decide to help the antagonists. Let the player know that this will be the outcome. Regardless of what side the party is on, they need to be on the same side. If they are not, the minority becomes NPCs and those players introduce new characters that align with the party's goals.",1727740814.0

There are vending machines at the interchanges but I'm pretty sure they don't sell tram only products. You would need to purchase a ""citywide"" ticket which is valid on buses and trams. From the vending machine that costs £21.60 plus £1 for the reusable smart card. If you happen to have a stagecoach smartcard issued anywhere else in the UK you can also use that. Honestly I would say it's likely going to be worth it as the tram network is pretty limited. You can also buy citywide tickets onboard but they then cost £23.40 (+£1).

There is no ticket machine at the tram stops. You just board. A guard comes through after most stops usually shouting: ""anymore fares"" and you pay them or show your ticket. They take card.

That's DURING menopause; not necessarily afterward, which is what I was talking about. For some women who have a high testosterone level after menopause, some are exposed to a higher risk of certain cancers. But nearly all women post-menopause will exhibit some masculine facial features as a result of having higher levels of testosterone. These higher levels of testosterone result in a boosted libido. This does not mean they don't have lubrication issues, or vaginal wall atrophy. Those symptoms are a result of their drop in estrogen level due to having gone through menopause.",1727740814.0

You bought $YMAX which meant you bought ALL of their funds 6 months ago including the ones that had their NAV artificially inflated due to the tech and Bitcoin (of which there are a LOT) rally, and have since been crushed, including:

$CONY, $YBIT, $MSTY, $TSLY, $GOOY, $AIYY, $NVDY, $AMDY, $SQY, $SNOY, $OARK, $MSFO, $FBY, $BABO, $APLY, $AMZY, $ABNY

That's like 90% of their ETFs that you bought at an all time high, including $CONY

Yieldmax launched their funds during a tech rally knowing a lot of money was flying around, and you bought the top. It happens.

I wouldn't drip to try to recover though, as that delays your breakeven considerably with each new share you buy. Even buying at $14/sh, on conservative distributions of $.50 per youre still looking at 2 years for each new share before you're ""playing with house money""

I would actually focus on supports/resistances of the underlying and time entries into specific yieldmax funds to get the most shares for your money, do that until I've allocated the total amount of funds I want, and then wait and hold to get that amount in distributions. Also, using the distributions to buy the underlying.

Once you've gotten distributions to cover your initial buy, which for you seems about $40,000 - you will not have any loss whatsoever. You can accelerate that with specific funds, but using $YMAX will take forever.

I have some $YMAG for its weekly income, and because it's ONLY 7 big tech stocks that I would be happy to wheel myself.",1727740814.0

For me personally, I just really don‘t love Buzz the way I love her other albums / EPs and I’m kind of disappointed.. 😕 I do think it‘s an interesting concept of making „a song for one dedicated star sign“ and I‘m sure the album sounds better live compared to when u listen to it on Spotify, as it was designed that way but alone the lacklustre setlist is a reason enough for me not to attend. I almost even booked flights and hotels to the nearest concert from my country in Paris (before the album was out) and thank god I didn‘t… 

One thing I wanna add though with the 6th point is that she made attempts on TikTok by telling the story each song of the album. They didn’t blow up or anything but 
all of them were recorded before the album came out for the fans to be excited for what‘s about to come. 

Thing is, like the album had a concept and I don‘t think any other artist had done this before but the way it was implemented, it‘s just bound to not perform well on charts… I also agree that „too much of a good thing“ of „blue moon“ should have not been lead singles, I would‘ve more liked „Buzz“ to be the one.",1727740814.0

Apparently there were some issues with spam over on freedesktop.org... which is where X's code is hosted. I don't know the specifics behind that but unilaterally blocking new account creation over it sounds like massively ret\*rded way to handle it IMHO.

I don't actively follow X either updates but my understanding is that they are more old school and do the mailing list thing like many GNU projects (such as Grub) / the kernel/ etc. If you're interested you can find more here:

> So, is it possible for x11 to add stuff like vector cursors, not anymore unintended screen tearing, HDR and VR support?

Theoretically, at least. Not sure on the actual likelihood. If it was going to happen, I imagine that it would come *after* they've progressed further in refactoring / cleanup efforts. But there's no accounting for random devs who get a hair up their ass about some particular thing or another which fuels a manic coding session and a magic patch.

"minnesotatwins","t5_2s4mv","That’s exactly how it works. The owners hire Falvey to take care of “Baseball Operations” which is literally everything from player transactions, setting up a good farm club, drafting, and building a good infrastructure and putting a good team on the field basically.

Falvey hires Rocco to be manager and manage the team he assembles for him in whatever way he does. I’m sure he also has an analytics department as well. The teams that have the most success in the playoffs are the ones that let their managers be managers. 

The difference between the Falvey/Rocco relationship and a Rocco/Coach relationship is Rocco is hired to manage the team and help them win and make decisions that get them the big W. A coach is hired by Rocco to help with strategy, development, training and so on, not to manage a game. Rocco is hired to manage the game.

Sure theoretically if Falvey wants to he can override the people he hired and go do whatever he wants, all businesses can do that if they really want to. He’s the president so he can tell anybody no or make every single decision if he wants to but he’s not a player manager, he has a specialist for it that he hired so I don’t understand why he doesn’t just trust his guy. In business it’s micromanaging, here I guess it could be some of that but it’s more just trying to do too much when you don’t have to.",1727740816.0

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","Yes. Every bathroom should have one. I worked at a company that installed one and after trying it, I got one for every toilet in my house. Best part is when the pandemic hit and you couldn't find toilet paper, I was completely unaffected.

It's not a 'get yourself clean for sex ' tool. But it is a 'keep your hole more sanitary and pretty one'. Toilet paper won't get you clean, since it is just smearing and scraping doo doo off. The friction of trying to rub your booty clean, is a big cause for hemorrhoids. Instead, bidets rinses you clean with water and so you only need to dab yourself dry.

One note. Spend the extra money to get a higher end model. A few must have features is the ability to warm the water and the ability to air dry you. Seat warning is also pretty nice if you live someplace that gets cold. But for these you will need power, so you might need electrician to add plug near it (if you don't want to look ghetto stringing extension cable across your bathroom. I'd avoid the cheap ones like the tushi base model. You don't need power, but you'll hate the experience. Ice cold water blasting your hole, then drying to dry yourself using more toilet paper than before you got it.

I really dislike how plastic women look today. Plastic and identical.  I see videos in my feed of women putting on their make up and I find it disturbing.  And it gives me the creeps to scroll through my FYP to see all these women with identical and totally unnatural eyebrows, noses and lips.

The Democrats had been the party of the South since Andrew Jackson, but starting in the late 1800s they gained a lot of immigrants (especially Irish and Italian immigrants) who ended up in the Northeast and Rust Belt. In the 1920s and 30s, they added the labor unions and more ethnic minorities to make one of the most powerful coalitions of all time - the New Deal coalition. The party was split between the northern labor unions and ethnic minorities, who wanted more civil rights and racial integration, and the Southern democrats who were opposed. The coalition held together until the Civil Rights movement forced the party to take a firm side, and when they did - in favor of civil rights - the South abandoned the party at last.",1727740817.0

"mazda3","t5_2tlj8","Update:

So first, the good news, the rim was perfectly fine with no cracks or damage....end of good news.

Checking my warranty tires are not covered through mazda. They directed me to Bridgestone, who said they *could* be covered if it was a defect and to take to a tireshop. 

Found out the originals are cheap and not going to last very long. Based on tread wear they were out of any warranty regardless of reason.


Looking at the tread and being AWD universally agreed have to do all 4...bummer, but not entirely unexpected.



So, what did the ""pros"" recommend?
Went to 3 places with the following results:

-Discount tire: Salesperson was friendly and seemed fairly knowledgeable (at first). He recommended Michelin Crossclimate2. However, they are not the same size tire. He just nonchalantly said it was no big deal and would only mess up my odometer and speedometer a little....yea no.

Tire: Michelin Crossclimate2
Quote: $1,034


-Tires Plus: Guy was not the friendliest and seemed to want me to just buy on the spot his one recommendation without any questions asked and then kept upselling me on alignment for life.

Tire: Firehawk AS V2
Quote: $884


Heartland Goodyear: Friendliest person by far, seemed the most knowledgeable, and no pressure or sales gimmicks. He pulled up dozens of options and recommended three, but said to feel free to do my own research too. They are also a full service shop, so have a little more trust in relationship down the road.

Tire: Continental DWS06 Plus
Quote: $895

Tire: Goodyear Eagle Sport AS
Quote: $908

Tire: General Tire G-max AS-07
Quote: $805

"WhiteWolfRPG","t5_2u6fa","""Except all of the Mage lore has been about controlling humans""

No it has never been. It's been about what HUMANS do when given power. The Trads and Union try to manipulate the MASSES and convince them to believe what they believe to further their paradigm. The Craftmasons also believed in uplifting all of humanity so that they ALL have the ability to fight back. And you know how that was represented? Not transhumanism. By the Craftmasons aiding and leading open rebellions against corrupt governments and Kingdoms.

  
""Ars Magica""

Ars Magica isn't Mage. Mage just took inspiration from it. The Mages of DAs are drastically different outside the OoH. And even the OoH is different with Tremere and the Craftmasons. 

  
""Traditions and Technocracy place Awakened mages at the top of the food chain""

Incorrect. SOME do. But as I pointed out others. Some make no differentiation. And you know how those that do differentiate it? Its not ""Your human and I am not"" It's:

Unenlightened Citizen

or

""Some stupid kid who couldn't study his fucking book"" in the OoH's case.

""There is no widespread movement that the unawakened are somehow the same as the Awakened.""

This is once again misunderstanding mage lore. The Trads, Dispirates and Conventions all have different beliefs. I literally called out 2 trads that view 0 difference.

""At best they are companions to help prop up your paradigm and at worst meat shields because there are billions more.""

Not to Verbena and Dreamspeakers. And No- Not even technocrats view the unenlightened masses as meat shields. It's literally illegal for them to get citizens hurt.",1727740818.0

You don't have all of these, but pieces that are commonly seen with Muahroom include: straight leg, pants, round toe or almond toe flats, button down shirts, simple necklines like boat neck or crew neck cardigans, trenchcoats and peacoats, etc. Mainstream brands like GAP known for basics, and J.Crew, known for classic preppy attire have a lot of Mushroom. Also most business to business casual stereotypical clothing includes Mushroom. Mushroom does not have a ton of detail or frill or visual interest and leans more toward being staple pieces.

"Asmongold","t5_2y1rb","I think you can do that without changing the personality of the character (meaning can be the same and this can still happen very easily), which these picture, although I agree with the google translate take, still change the personality of the characters. And I know that localizers have done similar things with google translations in the past, saw the same type of weird localization even from the hard translations, and we did in fact end up with a localization that changed the characters personality. Although I'm sure that won't be the case every time, I think we've seen enough situations like this where this should be seen at least as a red flag. And if we can see just a few of these instances, then I would bet these aren't the worst we will see in the game. To me, this is a big problem because it does change the personality of these characters. 

And I think we've already been passed just ""picking our battles"", if the pictured don't mislead, we've already seen stuff like this happen dozens of times. ""Picking our battles"" now is no different from just ignoring bad localization until we see the worst of the worst again, because these are pretty bad imo. There is nothing wrong with nor is there no reason why we shouldn't criticize every instance of a game with bad localization works. Not saying every bad line, but in general. And localization isn't the same as translation as you've said. This isn't just bad translation, this is changing a character, which can change how someone can see the story and even how someone can see the game as a whole. Like if a scene of someone dying is supposed to make you feel sad, but the localization made that character out to be an asshole wrongfully, nobody will feel sad about that death will they, and then all the other characters cry for that character, the player will be confused. If they do this with such a simple convo of what looks like an introduction with Gallica, what should we expect in more important scenes? Even if my worries end up unfounded in the end, why shouldn't we recognize red flags when we see them? If I'm wrong, then good, if I'm right, then I expected it and can save myself from a bad purchase. Should people who care not worry until they pay the box price, get like 80 hrs into a game like this only to then find out that everything you just went through was some fanfic from yet another rogue localizer as we've seen in the past? 

I understand if you don't want panic about this stuff from this alone, I'm not saying you should do anything, but the constant downplaying or dismissal of clear red flags from so many to me is what I personally find annoying.",1727740818.0

"HOTDGreens","t5_7131ym","Dude I started the book or the part of the dance totally for team black because both sides legit had a claim because of fuck ups and them starting to try and set a precedent, but not getting it locked in with the faith. For an example, Targaryen exceptionalism. That involved the faith directly. Viserys shit the bed. 

Either way both sides had a claim and we can go in circles about it. In my opinion, neither side was fit to roll, especially divided. That’s the tragedy of the whole dance. It was so preventable. 

However, in the book  Rhaenyra did the fuck as she pleased. Consequences be damned and Alicent started going after her early on and even trying to poach Cole until she got him. But sides were vile. But they both had a claim.

Alicent’s fears we’re completely valid in the book because she was fucking right. I don’t, however think Rhaenyra would but I don’t think she’d cry or protest if daemon did. And let’s be real there was going to be a succession crisis regardless. They even talk about it in Dunk& egg about how too many dragons is just as dangerous is too little.

Ultimately with the fight, we have unreliable narrators so you have to decide for yourself what to believe. In my head even though I was 14 black, I believed that Luce should have been punished, and was disgusted with Rhaenyra wanting an injured child tortured. Because that’s what she was saying.

These people are psychotic and have no critical thinking. The kids got into a fight and it escalated because of poison from the parents on both sides. But regardless, a child still had his eye fucking cut out. The book is incredibly biased, depending on when and who you’re reading from. And even our reliable(usually) narrators are unreliable during certain time periods. But these people are just psychotic.

At seventeen, Lenora HopeHung her sister with a rope
Now reduced to a schoolyard chant, the Hope family murders shocked the Maine coast one bloody night in 1929. 

While most people assume seventeen-year-old Lenora was responsible, the police were never able to prove it. 

Other than her denial after the killings, she has never spoken publicly about that night, nor has she set foot outside Hope’s End, the cliffside mansion where the massacre occurred.
Stabbed her father with a knifeTook her mother’s happy life
It’s now 1983, and home-health aide Kit McDeere arrives at a decaying Hope’s End to care for Lenora after her previous nurse fled in the middle of the night. 

In her seventies and confined to a wheelchair, Lenora was rendered mute by a series of strokes and can only communicate with Kit by tapping out sentences on an old typewriter. 

One night, Lenora uses it to make a tantalizing offer—I want to tell you everything.
“It wasn’t me,” Lenora saidBut she’s the only one not dead
 As Kit helps Lenora write about the events leading to the Hope family massacre, it becomes clear there’s more to the tale than people know. 

But when new details about her predecessor’s departure come to light, Kit starts to suspect Lenora might not be telling the complete truth—and that the seemingly harmless woman in her care could be far more dangerous than she first thought.",1727740819.0

"RomanceBooks","t5_2sxjx","I don’t think I was clear when I agreed with the original comment about first person and “lazy writing” and want to expand on what I actually mean. Like I said, I love both first and third person writing. I don’t believe that a writer is automatically a lazy writer if they choose to write in first person because, as I mentioned, I’ve read romance books in FP that were well written, my main example I mentioned being Lucy Watson, who writes fabulous FP indie romance. 

Sally Thorne is another modern author who does FP well (although tbh, THG is really the only book of hers I’ve enjoyed, but I still like her writing style). The introduction to The Hating Game is one of my more memorable openings to a contemporary romance novel because of its blend of second POV blended with witty first POV.

What I more so mean by lazy writing is that a lot of FP I’ve read tends to feel immature not necessarily because it’s first person, but because fast fiction type of books tend to be written in first person. 

So if anything, the root of my issue is with fast fiction type of books, and not FP itself. These types of books just tend to largely be written in FP. Many classics have used FP POV, The Great Gatsby for example, and they’re well written. 

I read both self published and traditionally published books. I have KU. But tbh, this is the Wild Wild West because you truly never know what you’ll get because anyone can publish on KU. I’m grateful for self publishing because I’ve read so many good books I never would have gotten the opportunity to read if only traditional publishing was the sole way to publish your book (but I have to wade through mediocre meh books to find the good ones lol). So, I think FP gets a bad rap because these types of books get lots of exposure on social media. And hell, not all traditional published books are quality well written literature either (Fifty Shades/Twilight). But these are the type of FP books that come across as lazy writing to me. FP gets a bad rap, but when I find a good FP, SO GOOD. 

There was a comment here that summed it up, a lot of these FP books tend to go “I am the Vampire Lestat. I'm immortal more or less. The light of the sun, the sustained heat of an intense fire..."" 

I will agree on the RS Grey bit. I read it back and I think I was a bit delusional and it was after midnight cause that was a bad example lol. As I said, I do actually enjoy her writing itself. I know what I’m getting when I read her books. I actually don’t think this bit is exclusive to just first person as I’ve read third person books by the same author where the leads will read the same. Even Susan Elizabeth , who I recommended, tends to follow a formula lol. I love Mariana Zapata and I still eat up her books even if they are a bit formulaic. 

It’s interesting because there tends to be a generational divide between those who prefer first or third person romance books. Preference for first person POV tends to skew younger while third person tends to skew older, which makes sense considering romance was almost exclusively written in 3rd POV up until the 2000/2010s. I’m in my mid twenties and like both of them, but will admit that I didn’t like third person POV in my romance books until a few years ago (I’ve always preferred it in my fantasy books). 

I will admit that there is some truth in the fact that some third person books do fall flat with character development and it can be a chore to read because you can’t connect with the character (which is what I primarily love about reading). Which sometimes can actually be a good thing because I’ve read insufferable FMCs who are ding dongs, but the book is written in 3rd POV so I don’t have to listen to her inner monologue. And sometimes the POV will switch, so I can hate FMC from afar instead of constantly live in her head haha. 

I’ve said before to my reader friends that it is an immense compliment to an author from me when he or she “makes third person POV feel like I’m reading first POV,” because I get it. It IS easier to self insert in FP or feel a bond with the MC because you’re in his/her head the entire book (which as I just said, can be a curse lol), and it IS more challenging to connect with a lead in 3rd POV if it’s not done right.

 I enjoy romantic suspense, but I do think this is one of the hardest romance subgenres to find both quality suspense and quality character development, and it’s usually the character development/romance that suffers. So I do get people’s complaints about third person, and sometimes they are valid. 

I do think the wariness of 3rd POV tends to come from the fact that a lot of these popular romance books just aren’t written in 3rd person anymore, so a lot of younger readers tend to not have the exposure to 3rd POV (whereas people who grew up on 90s romance are used to it because that was really the only option). It actually took me reading older romance books to really fall in love with third person POV in romance books. 

I absolutely agree with you about why people are critical of first person narration. It really can be harder to find good FP books, especially if indie books is your primary outlet for reading because like I said, you have to wade through more meh fast fiction books to find what you’re looking for, and a lot of the booktok books pushed to viewers are meh written (not all of them).

Oh yeah, Susan Elizabeth Phillips and Julie James are two good ones. A lot of SEP books are problematic as hell. I was covering my mouth in shock at points and I don’t tend to do that often. But I still keep coming back to them lol. 

I love Julie James. I actually just finally got around to finishing the last book I had left of hers and now I’m sad 😂 she was a lawyer before a romance author and that knowledge really shines throughout her books. Her banter is always fun. I will say that I do sometimes wish she would develop the conflict in some of her books a bit more, like I always feel like I’m wanting that little bit more, but she’s like a solid 4 star author for me. I recommend her FBI/US Attorney series, {Something About You by Julie James} is the first and my favorite, although I enjoyed the second a lot as well (the rest of the series too, but the conflict/plot is best in books 1 and 2 imo). ",1727740819.0

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","I think you can rework Loki in a way that keeps him a trickers, and doesnt make him an AOE DPS frame, and instead makes him more of a crowd control trickster. I made a comment in a similar post on an alt, and I'll leave my ideas here.   
  
""Loki is themed around the identity of being a trickster but the kit falls on its face in mid-range gameplay. His passive doesn't get utilized because it doesn't fit the high mobility nature of Warframe. His decoy ability dies too fast to be any amount of viable in mid to late game content. His switch teleport is highly niche and situational, and worse than Ashes that can be followed up with a finisher, or Kullervos which doesn't need to target an enemy and gives crit chance. His Invisibility is the only part of his kit that's good, and I'd argue that it fits the least. He's not supposed to be a stealth frame, he's supposed to be a trickster. It'd make more sense for him to disguise himself as an enemy, but DE didn't have the tech for that when he was made back in 2012. His radial disarm is also incredibly weak, and doesn't scale very well given that at high levels enemies with overguard arent effected and enemy shield and armor levels make it hard for them to harm each other.   
  
For his passive, enemies affected by his ability get a radiation proc, confusing them and allowing them to friendly fire. Make Decoy invulnerable and reflect damage. Make Switch Teleport be able to switch 2 enemies' positions, or just teleport yourself to a location like Kullervos 1. Change Invisibility into a disguise that makes you look like an enemy to sneak past them, and any enemy that sees you disguise yourself become radiation proc'ed and alarmed. Make Radial Disarm also defense strip enemies. This makes Loki into a warframe all about sowing confusion on the battlefield, allowing him manipulate key figures in combat and turning the enemy against themselves""

I agree his abilities shouldn't be nuking, his radiation procs shouldn't be doing enough damage to kill. Just enough to allow enemies to attack and kill each other. I think this tweaking of his kit could actually work really well, but alas, if Pablo has open disagreed, then I guess Loki will stay the same way he's been for a literal decade with no change. That's kinda painful.",1727740822.0

She should be thankful for her to be husbands generosity. Not many guys are accepting of girls past or being okay with her not changing her surname. After marriage problems crop up and then women have to fight for it. 


> My dad to this day helps my mom to cook and clean and makes her morning coffee.


So? Majority of men in India don't. That's reality. You're the one who's delusional 


> Having a maid is not ease the women’s job. But to ease the family’s job.


A woman regardless of her working status cannot avoid home chores. She still needs to manage it. So in this case a maid is necessary to ease her burden otherwise she'll be very stressed and her health will be affected.


> I pity the women who are in your environment who are constantly told they’re less than and forced to accept incompetence from men.


Okay, pity them.


> Working women contribute financially to the household same as the men. So gone are the days where you can use that as an excuse and use her as a free maid. 


In arranged marriage women do marry up. They want a guy who wants to earn more than them. 


Also, as she's earning she can hire maid using her own money so that it'll be easy for her to manage house. That's what working women do in my office who are living as nuclear family. The ones living in joint family have their MIL for help.


> The OP here is a CA and is a self starter and for a man to have this entitlement just because he’s a man is ridiculous. A woman is also leaving her family behind, starting a new relationship in an unfamiliar environment whereas in your so called cases most men are comfortable to stay in their mom’s house and continue to be coddled


And? It's not ridiculous, it's reality. Most working women in India especially middle class women are able to work because they have in laws living with them because someone needs to handle the child. Nannies aren't always good & reliable and good daycares cost a lot.


> I’m so glad people I know in India aren’t stuck in marriages with people who share your mindset.


There's nothing wrong in my mindset. After marriage lots of stuff changes for the wife. If she's living in nuclear setup then she needs good maid support. If she's living in joint family then it's another issue. 


Either way she needs to manage everything from childcare and household chores and sometimes their husbands help. ",1727740823.0

Also, where I live in Texas, I actually make less than 2.75 an hour at a small mom and pop Asian restaurant. Most big cities do have a higher minimum pay, and a majority of states do as well, but Texas is a VERY large state where most cities don't mandate that.

Also, 20 of the 50 states have a minimum of 3 dollars or less. It does get bumped up, of course. However, if I worked 10 hours and made less than 75 dollars prior to taxes mind you, I'd have to quit.

I get where you're coming from about employers paying their staff more. I think waiters would be open to that if it was close to like 15-20(state dependent) dollars but that's just not going to happen, at least for a good long while.

My philosophy both before and after I will be done being a waiter (I start a new job fairly soon) is to factor it into the meal prior I get people don't like it and if you really don't want to you don't have to but keep in mind places where they pat their wait staff more generally have higher priced food so in my opinion in generally evens out.",1727740824.0

It’s been a long time since I’ve properly watched Scary Island and Kelly’s time on the show, but I definitely could see on UGT how Kristen was antagonizing Kelly and sort of purposefully not understanding her, if that makes sense. I think eventually, Kelly got overwhelmed and did start to kind of live up to the expectations of being delusional, but I think it was triggered by being ganged up on once again.  I like Kristen in general, but felt she was overly defensive of her cheating husband while shitting on the other women for not being married. 

I think since she rewatched Housewives leading up to the trip, Kristen was more tuned into how to play the game, and quickly flipped Dorinda to be an ally to her after pissing her off early on. Once Dorinda joined, the others eventually followed suit, to the point where Luann, the ONLY person to bring back Kelly since season four, says that they weren’t ever really that close to begin with. I am not the biggest Kelly fan, but did feel bad for her on the St. Barth’s trip.",1727740824.0

"Bible","t5_2qqbz","Peace to you, imcalmright.  

I fear for you, because you are speaking the words I've heard many times from brothers who immediately thereafter left the faith and destroyed their lives in pursuit of pleasure.   You need the Holy Spirit, friend.  Cleaning up your spiritual house on your own steam just makes you tired.  

Matthew 11:28-30   
>Come to Me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.   
29 Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.  
30 For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”

Imagine yourself at the foot of the Cross where Jesus is.  Take communion if you can. Then ask the Lord for His Holy Spirit to guide you as you read the Bible.  Then listen to your conscience throughout the day.  When you listen to your conscience, you open your mind to the lesson God has to teach you.  The whole point of having a conscience is so you can be directed into lessons you need to make you fit for eternity.  

Reading the Bible is useless unless you meditate on it in a way that can allow you to apply it to your life.  If you read the true stories of people in the Bible, and put yourself in their place, you'll find God's voice and your ministry.  

People far from Jesus will sympathize with you gladly here.  They've forgotten that we all owe our lives to someone who believed in helping the helpless.  That's what Jesus bled and died to remind us of.  When you find your ministry, boredom and lack of enjoyment will vanish from your life.  

This is the secret of Matthew 10:39  
>He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.

Find your purpose. Find your ministry.  Read Jesus' prophecies so you can see they are coming true before our eyes.  Then you will be able to join those of us who ""look up because our redemption is near!""  This is the greatest enjoyment of all.

-- represents an abrupt cut-off of thought. Transcribers aren't going to go to all the trouble of taking down ancillary, seriously truncated conversations.

Without the DM involved: Laura: 2,917 Taliesin: 1,596. If you are referring to talking in character and being interrupted, I fail to see how that is a salient metric. Talking over each other, above-table is still bad manners and is relevant.

"FirstTimeHomeBuyer","t5_379e9","There's a bit to unpack. 

1. Buying a starter home now is *probably* the easiest way to buy a larger home in 5 years or whenever you want to upgrade.

2. But you shouldn't buy a house that you couldn't live in for 10 years if you had too, because you never know what will happen. To housing prices, rates, your jobs, the unexpected triplets, etc. 

3. The median length of homeownership tenure is 12 years. (This is not as helpful as it seems, since the median age of FTHB tenure is probably shorter, and balanced by people staying in their ""forever"" homes for 20+ years.) But FYI.

So it kind of depends on what you mean by ""starter home"", ""more spacious"", and ""forever home"". 

If the starter home you are looking at is a 2 br/1b 900 sqft home that you are already thinking will be cramped, but it's easier to afford than a 1700 sqft 3br/2.5b more spacious home that you would prefer, I would probably wait.

If your starter home is the 1700 3/2.5 and your idea of a forever home is a 4000 sqft 4/3.5 with a large family room and a basement you can convert to a home theater, you're probably okay with the 1700 sqft home.

Having said that, buying and selling and packing and moving and unpacking is its own kind of hell.",1727740825.0

Defunding the police is the dumbest thing I've heard of my entire life. I will never vote for a politician who even tacitly supported that. 

Telling minors that they were born in the wrong body, and giving them puberty blockers and more is insanely extreme and is child abuse. Children can't consent and don't understand the severity of that kind of thing.

Giving free healthcare to illegal aliens is a slap in the face to the taxpayer who still has to pay for their healthcare.

Refusing to close the border is extreme and dangerous. Now Dems are backtracking because they learned it's unpopular and there's an election coming up.

Allowing abortion up to 9 months is extreme.

Taxing unrealized gains in the stock market is stupid as fuck, whoever had that idea doesn't know how this stuff works.

Refusing to support Israel fully while they battle Iran's terrorist proxies on several different fronts is fucked. There's American hostages but you never hear about that from the Dems. It's only ""why is Israel being so mean when they're preventing attacks against its own citizenry"". Your dear Democrats have literally had kinder words for these terrorist murdering rapist than they would for their political opposition. 

Withdrawing from Afghanistan was a shit show, and we left tons of military equipment behind, and left our allies, and women all over that country to be tormented or killed. 

Choosing equity over equality of opportunity is entirely opposite to the American dream. Meritocracy is the American dream. 

Giving Iran a shit ton of money which has now been used to help facilitate their proxy war with Israel.

Then, once they have spawned, you can just leave them right fucking there until you go kill the opfor that inevitably spawns after the comfort spawns. After that, you can surround the collection point with your company while you drive the convoy up in a group and drive them onto the pickup location. That way you're prepared for the next inevitable wave of opfor spawns no matter which direction they come from.

Escort missions are still a bit annoying, but they're no longer a nightmare. Not as long as your force is prepared to handle the opfor. That bit is up to you.",1727740826.0

"doctorsUK","t5_59h6f4","I think the job needs to change. Instead of FY1 and FY2, we should have a single intern year that you choose during med school like how they do in America so that an aspiring physician isn’t forced into a surgical job they have no interest in but can focus on being a good medic. I am an extending FY2 and doing very well in a medicine job and even want to take referrals myself for medicine but SpR says I need to walk before I run but put me in the same surgery job as you and I will struggle as I have absolutely no interest in surgery and will be bored to death and will always need to ask a senior for advice. If I can’t get senior advice then I will just admit the patient, do A-E, nbm, IV fluids, CT AP, NGT if needed and wait for senior review. In F1 I took referrals in surgery from GPs and my seniors were ok with admitting all referrals as this was better than rejecting a true surgical pathology. My F2s were cocky and took pride in rejecting referrals as if this is a badge of competence but later scolded by consultants when the same patient ended up under medics and turned out to have a surgical pathology for which there are clear pathways. As a F2, I would say, admit if any doubt at all and do your A-E, scans and initial management (fluid resuscitation, Abx +\- NGT) and leave the rest for your senior to decide",1727740829.0

(Summary: Heroine that saved the world, is cursed with spreading sexual desire to everyone around her to use her. Her attempts to fight will be turned into an overbearing amount of lust. The hero is cursed to be overwhelmed by lust, if she cannot escape or find a way to overcome the curse and defeat the new evil, then she will succumb to desire.)

It was a cliche story. For hundred of years, the kingdom of Eros had struggled to survive against the grasp of the Great Demon King, claiming godhood and the throne to the lands that the sun shines over. Legions of horrors controlled the lands, hordes of goblins, orcs, and a myriad of other hellish creatures marched and claimed the lands, ushering the world into a age of chaos. Humanity struggled and fought their way to survive through advancing weaponry and honing in their magical prowess, for hundred of years, humans managed to persist and hold off against the reign of monsters. Despite this, humanity's progress had been halted, and their days were numbered.

At the absolute limits of the last kingdoms remaining, a four great heroes rose from across the kingdoms, teaming up to venture across the lands of monsters. Traveling beyond the dangerous lands, and reaching the demon king's lair, defeating their guards, and facing off against the evil god. After a hard fought battle, the heroes came out victorious. The death of the leader alone would cascade into over half of the legion of monster's dissipating, their armies nowhere enough to have any influence, only to be taken out slowly by adventuring guilds and parties. The kingdoms were able to begin cleanup after the hard work of the heroes.

Now that the war was won, the party had disbanded, all returning to their own kingdoms to assist in rebuilding their life after the war is over. \[You\] are one of the heroes that had vanquished the great demon lord. Regarded as a hero of her nation, savior of the world, and many other praises. Over the years, humanity would recover slowly as the scar of the demon king remains through occasional goblin camps or monsters roaming the fields outside of society.

Four years had passed since the great battle. The kingdoms are now prosperous, and normal life has returned.

Yet... one night, a vision was planted in our hero's sleep. The power gap of the demon king left an empty seat. Within the vision, an unnamed god was seen sitting at the throne in which the final battle has occurred. The hero, was present within this dream. Within this dream, the god would announce the hero to be it's avatar, to spread the age of lust wherever she walked.

The heroine, once one of the four strongest warriors of the world, was now cursed by a new evil. Cursed to seduce all that surrounds here, all would perceive sexual actions towards her to be completely normal. Monsters and Villains would be attracted to her for the sake of using her to break her sexually. And her own prowess with magic or weapons would be hindered, any time she would attempt to fight with her weapon or magic, her body would slowly overwhelm her with sexual desire.

The heroine that had once saved the world, is now reduced to a sexual object that would spread the sin of lust everywhere she walked. The townspeople will try to force themselves onto her without knowing why. The world around her would alter into a sexual environment somehow, and the curse will follow her as a womb tattoo, signaling of her curse.

(Hello! Thank you for reading this far! Wanted to try out this idea to see how it goes. Prompt is open to any type of scenario you want to play! Maybe it has more adventure and its filled with monsters and bandits trying to kidnap her and use her at their camps? Or maybe the townspeople would overwhelm her and publicly disgrace her if she fails to leave the city before the lust grows too strong around her? Or maybe the curse has more traits? Maybe our hero can't cast spells unless she charges up with sexual intercourse?

The point is that the hero has been reduce to level 1 basically. But the adventure will consist of mostly sexual situations as she tries to figure out what to do, how to stop the curse, and how to get rid of it. Everyone around her may see her as a hero, but the curse would stop them from being able to help.

If you are interested, please shoot me a message. Looking forward to hearing from you!)

Yet he survived. 

Now the government wants him to do it again—to go back into the wilderness so that astronauts and the military can learn the survival techniques that kept Brian alive.This time he won't be alone: Derek Holtzer, a government psychologist, will accompany him to observe and take notes. 

But during a freak storm, Derek is hit by lightning and falls into a coma.

Brian is afraid that Derek will die of dehydration unless he can get him to a doctor.

"runningman","t5_2u830","Song Ji Hyo was definitely the ace. Did no one watch the first 200 episodes of running man?? First off I don’t know why people call KJK the bravest running man member when he was obviously afraid of heights and so many other things that Ji Hyo wasn’t afraid of. Check out ep 134 in Macau where they climbed to the top of the tall building and he was afraid to go near the edge. He even said that thank goodness there were clouds bcz he wouldn’t be able to look down. But shortly after SJH came and stood at the edge without a bit of fear and even played with the clouds. In episode 160 you can see SJH holding Haha and KJKs hands while they were riding the helicopter bcz they were afraid. In episode 179 KJK also jumped at the sight of chickens, the same chickens SJH effortlessly catches. 
My second point is that SJH was definitely the best and smartest spy amongst all the members and that’s why she was given the role more often than the other members. She had me fooled so many times but here are a few examples. Ep 132 where she had actors Sung Woon and Jung Min fooled so bad that they didn’t believe she was the spy until LKS ripped off her Nametag. Other good examples are ep 80 with Charlie’s angels and episode 140.
Third reason why I firmly believe that SJH was an Ace is because of her amazing strength. Of course she wasn’t stronger than any of the male members but she was able to beat them at Sirreum and wrestling because of her skills. She undoubtedly beat Jee Seok Jin at Sirreum two times with her effective leg tripping and although she never beat haha in that wrestling match in 167 you could obviously tell that he was struggling when he even screamed stop. 
The fourth undoubtable reason she was the ace is because of her amazing luck. I will give some full proof examples in case some people say that it was staged. Just how in the world did she guess the right combination of sheep and wolves in ep 178?? And how did she know the exact number of stones under the hands in ep 209??? If you watched the early episodes you would know that her name always came out in the running ball drawings.
 
The last reason is her amazing finding skills just as good if not better than Kim Jong Kook’s. In the earlier episodes she was always the one to find hiding things and guests. 
Other reasons include how clever she was on the go. Whenever guests came over she would always be left to lead the easy brothers or any combination of Seok Jin , Gary, Haha and Kwang Soo. It was very easy to see that they always followed her lead. If you want proof, check out episode 88 with Ji Hyo, Kwang Soo and Seok Jin and check out episode 50 with Ji Hyo, Haha and Gary.

She was also undoubtedly one of the fastest name tag ambushers on running man. Of course if the male members wanted to rip off her Nametag by physically overpowering her they easily could but if you let your guard down even a little bit in front of her there was almost a 90% chance that you name tag was gone. She was really fast and skilled with the Nametag ripping. If you need examples check out ep 102 with haha, episode 138 with Soo Ro just to name a few.

Actually if you watch the first 200 episodes of running man without missing a single episode you will find a sea of reasons why Song Ji Hyo was the ace of running man.",1727740829.0

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Atheists act like every part of religion is bad yet religion gave us these values:

Well personally I don’t think every part of every religion is bad. That’s just a silly statement.

The values you list are mostly fine, whatever. I don’t care to get into that. Almost all of those can be found outside of religion within specific philosophies like Stoicism or others.

But there’s other values that I don’t agree with. The promotion of slavery, treating women as subservient to men, caste structures, anti-lgbt, separating animals into “clean” and “unclean”, death for apostates, worship of gods, etc.

What values does atheism give?

None. Atheism is just the belief that no gods exist. Other moral and philosophical frameworks are required to be used.

Humanism? Humanism is a flawed ideology since it’s completely subjective and can easily fall into moral relativism, existential crises, and nihilism.

That’s just begging the question. You’re just asserting that a subjective system is somehow inferior, as is a relativistic system. And I don’t see why Humanism is more prone to existential crises than any other view. Is there data to back that up? Are you taking about Secular Humanism? That’s not exactly a widely accepted view.

Without a sense of purpose tied to something greater than humanity, many people feel lost or disconnected in a humanist society.

What society is a majority “humanist” society where this has occurred?

The rise of anxiety, depression, and feelings of meaninglessness in secular societies points to the limitations of humanism in providing answers to life’s biggest questions. It has been reported that people who are “spiritual” or religious tend to feel more happy in their life.

Let’s say I grant that. What turns on it? What does it have to do with whether or not a god exists?",1727740830.0

The Democrats haven't had a functional majority since like 2010 and even that lasted just long enough to get a highly compromised (because of moderates and republicans) Obamacare and then was gone.

"RogueTraderCRPG","t5_6gpfqe","The end of Commorragh is the biggest empathy/pragmatism test.

The torture you guys suffer in Commorragh I some of the worst you can get in the setting, made even worse by the act being one of those ‘deprive you of your gear and powers’ acts. You leave and you gotta deal with your perfidious xenos. Yrliet is either treacherous, stupid or both; regardless she betrayed you trust and got you captured by the worst faction that you could be captured by. Hilariously I think Marazhai is in a better position - yeah he’s the murder-rapist who murder-raped across your domain, but he didn’t betray you and having an allied Dracon is beyond handy.

I haven’t done any heresy so I can’t speak for that alignment, but truly Dogmatic you gotta kill em big - Big E said suffer not the xenos to live, and while the rogue trader gets wiggle room; traitors and murder-rapists must be purged. For iconoclast you really gotta have inhumanly high tiers of empathy to accept that Yrliet was hurting and had been manipulated, though it’s a bit easier when Marzipan explains that she’s just a dunce and wasn’t in on it. Marazhai torturing you is certainly enough to warrant death, but he was up front with it and having a Dracon is a useful tool for a rogue trader who is iconoclastic not because they are simply nicer, but because they dislike the Imperium’s inefficiencies - where as a dogmatic would just kill the xenos, by allying Marzipan you can push a bunch of Kabals into conflict (killing far more Drukhari and wreaking far more havoc than if you just kill Marzipan) and if your empowering Marazhai gambit works, having an allied Kabal is beyond handy.

Xenos gunna xenos, Big E said suffer em not to love for a reason - yeah the Imperium takes everything overboard, but it’s the way it is for very good reason.",1727740830.0

"BoardgameDesign","t5_2sqpc","Hybrids definitely exist and in many different shapes. My 2 go-to examples are Chronicles of Crime and Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes.


Chronicles is marketed as a board game, but to me it's clearly a video game played on a cellphone qui a cardboard controller. It's mostly app based murder mysteries with inputs done by scanning cards. It had a few expansions and spin offs. It fell off the radar a bit but was a great commercial success as far as I can tell.


Keep Talking and Nobody explodes is a 2 player coop game about someone using a computer (or VR headset) disarming a bomb with the help of someone on voice chat using a manual. Often played on discord and with a pdf, it works really well with a laptop and a printed copy of the manual too. To me it's clearly a computer assisted boardgame because the crux of the gameplay is communication between 2 players.


Steam has a few werewolf style hidden identity games. A computer is great because noone needs to be the host, everyone gets to play. Also games can be a lot nore complexe, I think it was Agrou I tried to get into and the classes were very deep. Of course, Among Us is arguably one of those games, but a lot of them are turn based and closer to a board game.


There's also the Jackbox series of game. Maybe I should have started with this one since it might be closest to your project. There are many games but the basic concept is that you need a common bigscreen (often the TV) while everyone interact with the game through their cellphones. Instructions can be displayed as needed, players can draw or answer secretly while chuckling, the game does what need to be done and then results are displayed on the screen. They were mostly meant as TV party games but they worked very well over discord, I know ""Friday Night Jack Box"" was a thing for a lot of people during the height of covid. (I'm going to mention Garthic Phone and Scribbl.io since they occupy a similar spot in gaming.)



By the way, someone had a similar question a month ago. I'm leaving a link here in case the answers they got help you out too. https://www.reddit.com/r/BoardgameDesign/s/scF6d33NRr",1727740831.0

જો અંગ્રેજી માધ્યમનું મૂળ ઔપનિવેશિક માનસ છે, તો તેને ભાંગવા માટે પ્રયાસો કેમ નથી થતા? જો એમ માની લઈએ કે સરકારને રસ નથી, તો આટઆટલા લોકો કેમ હજી પણ આનંદથી ગુલામી કરી રહ્યા છે? જ્યારે ઉપરછલ્લો ગુજરાતી ભાષાને પ્રેમ કરવાનો આવે છે, ત્યારે લોકો મોટી મોટી ભાવનાઓ અને વાતો લઈને આવી તો જાય છે. પણ જ્યારે નક્કર વિચારો લઈને કાર્ય કરવા માટે આગળ વધવાની પહેલ કરીએ છીએ ત્યારે લોકો અંગ્રેજીની મહાનતા સામે ગુજરાતીને વામણી કહી દે છે એમ કેમ?

બંધુ, તમને ખોટું લાગ્યું હોય તો ક્ષમા કરશો, પણ જ્યારે વાત બાળકોના માનસની છે, તેમના ભવિષ્યની છે, સંસ્કૃતિ, દેશની ઉન્નતિ વગેરેની છે, ત્યારે આ પ્રશ્નો પૂછવા અનિવાર્ય થઈ પડે છે. આતો મોડા પૂછ્યા છે, આની ઉપર કાર્ય તો વર્ષોથી થવું જોઈતું હતું. લોકોને વૈચારિક ગુલામીમાંથી બહાર આવવાની ઈચ્છા નથી એટલે કાર્ય થયું નથી, પણ પ્રયાસો ન છોડાય. 🙏🏾",1727740831.0

They don't need to since the powergrid is already monopolized. It's that excess power that isn't used cannot be stored and must be dissipated somehow which is why the price goes negative. You have to pay people to dispose of the energy or find a safe way to dissipate it yourself which also costs money. On the other side you get no energy at night. The obvious solution is having energy storage, but so far no method that has sufficient energy density, efficiency, and scalability has been developed. Currently Natural gas is being used to supliment green energy to circumvent this, but until the energy storage problem is solved it's impossible to transition to renewables without dramatically reorganizing industry and society.",1727740832.0

Goes infinite with things literqlly any creature, instead of MV3 or less. But that doesn't really matter.

The only argument for Chthonian being ""better"" is the one reduced mana enabling easier dockside loops.

As they’re working in the house one day, there’s a knock on the door. 

A man stands there with his family, claiming to have lived there years before and asking if it would be alright if he showed his kids around. 

People pleaser to a fault, Eve lets them in.As soon as the strangers enter their home, uncanny and inexplicable things start happening, including the family’s youngest child going missing and a ghostly presence materializing in the basement. 

Even more weird, the family can’t seem to take the hint that their visit should be over. 

And when Charlie suddenly vanishes, Eve slowly loses her grip on reality. 

Something is terribly wrong with the house and with the visiting family—or is Eve just imagining things?",1727740833.0

This alone is a reason to put this song in your playlist.  The break at 2:50 is just sublime.  I have been trying to learn it off and on for a year.   I have made a tab, but I can't play it at even 3/4 speed.  There is a live performance on youtube, but I am sure it was ripped from an VHS tape so it really sucks.  This is a CD ripped track.

(not to mention that after that Falcon made things even worse due to dissolving the party and having it's MPs and infrastructure be absorbed by the BCC.

Thematically, the water killing the base is pretty on point for a survival game. Could it use some more functionality like growing a garden or making things with it? Sure. Does it need to be removed or have an option to opt out? Not in my opinion. 3 months is a long time. Water runs take 7 mins. Got a family with 3 kids and a 40 hour job?

"careerguidance","t5_2t9i0","Help people.  Genuinely.

Set aside time every day for staying in contact.  
Set aside time every week for catching up with someone properly 
Set aside time each month for doing something more meaningful such as a workshop.

Remember your boss is never going to ask you to do these things.  You will have to block off your diary and organise it yourself.

You don't sound desperate by most frequently catching up without any urgent need or expectation.   But do be honest, if you're hoping they will find you a job then ask directly.  

There's a lot of people out there, so it's relatively easy to subset it to those you like.  You have to come across as genuine, and the only way I know of doing that is to be genuine.  So if someone I don't particularly like is hiring for a company, then I still don't like that person and wouldn't reach out.  

I struggle at networking events.  I get the benefit: there are loads of interesting people that I'd never bump into otherwise and I'd love to meet.  If the conversation goes well then I'll organise a follow-up.  Also there's lots of people I know and like but they don't make it to the top of my queue to meet up.  You can get a five minute reacquaintance with a dozen people in just an hour.

So the benefit is clear, but I struggle to do it in practice.  In the past I've used a little personal CRM to help.  I'm not currently, but I might go back to doing that.",1727740834.0

"HealthcareHomies","t5_68md25","I am really sorry to hear you're dealing with this — it sounds like a really stressful and unfair situation, especially since it’s affecting your career goals. It’s tough when you feel like you've done everything right, and still end up facing accusations like this. It sounds like you didn’t access the patient chart, and from what you describe, there might be some technical glitch or a misunderstanding. These EMR systems can sometimes log badge activity incorrectly, or it could be someone else accessed the system while it was still logged in under your name. I know it can be hard when it feels like your hands are tied and your intentions are questioned.

The fact that you had a witness who supposedly saw you on the computer but didn’t back you up sounds really frustrating. It’s really unfortunate that they didn’t support you, especially since you believe they might not be telling the whole story. And I get why you're feeling paranoid, especially if you're hearing through the grapevine that this coworker was telling others you were in the chart. It’s even more frustrating if you know they themselves have accessed patient charts without permission.

As far as HR goes, it’s not uncommon for them to put someone on leave while they investigate potential HIPAA violations. It’s one of those things they often treat as ""better safe than sorry,"" especially since HIPAA is such a huge deal in healthcare. But it definitely sucks to be left in the dark, not knowing what’s going on or having a chance to explain yourself right away. Since you’re worried about future rehire opportunities, reaching out to HR in a calm, professional manner is probably your best bet. Just be honest about wanting to clear things up and express your dedication to patient privacy and doing your job right. It might help to gather some support from old coworkers who know you well — even if HR doesn’t officially take those into account, it might be useful to have people willing to vouch for your character and intentions.",1727740835.0

Also I echo the sentiments voiced here that, if I'm going to pick Hatshepsut and play as Egypt, it's because I WANT to play as Egypt. I want to enjoy the craziness of the Egyptian civilization, pyramid sphinxes and all, making it to the space age and beating the Soviets to the Space Race or something.

But the game FORCING me to choose another civ later on? Often from a bunch I don't care about? For a gamer who doesn't care about history and just wants ""the best stats"" sure, whatever. I have preferences as to which civ I play and which I dislike because I'm that much of a history nerd. This is (was) THE history game.

I don’t know if you have heard of this concept before, but it’s common practice for tourists and guests to postpone their trips before the release of a new expansion. This is not exclusive to universal. Disney parks often see a lull in attendance before the release of a new park expansion, see the attendance plateau of California adventure in 2010 before the opening of cars land, compared to 2012.  Imagine that change in attendance for an entire 750 acre theme park compared to that of a 12 acre park land. I don’t expect the universal resort to surpass wdw in attendance in 2025 when they’re still behind by a full gate worth of attendance. However, people are holding off for Epic universe, and with the 3 park ticket requisite to visiting, universal has guaranteed that all parks will see an equitable attendance boom.

> **Can I pay to get into the Beta?**

> Yes, the new set of supporter packs (released simultaneously with the Beta) will all grant access. In addition, we will likely invite players with significant previous support immediately without the need for a purchase. We define this as a purchase of any top-tier pack ($440 or above) or people whose total lifetime purchases combine to $500 or more. For everyone who supports in any amount, thank you. You make expansions like this possible.

> **How are players selected to enter the Beta?**
> For the past two Betas (Closed Beta and The Awakening's Beta), we used a public Beta Key timer on the website that would invite one player per five minutes. While we gained infinite satisfaction from watching reactions from players, it was a little contentious during The Awakening's Beta and and the negative aspects from players being upset outweighed the fun of the trolling.

It also just comes off unpleasant, like, a kid going ""I want to save everyone"" and you not knowing how to respond, and you just being critical. I mean this all interpersonally well.

> it’s very centered on suffering and compassion, and most people really don’t want to think about those things, nor even think it’s necessary.

I feel this just isn't 'looking at' the entire world and hoping to impact it, then. Okay, like, ignore suffering? and compassion? I feel your complaints aren't in the right direction. 
 
What world do you live in?

I think it is overwhelmingly manageable to do what needs to be done and I feel you just aren't 'playing ball' with the topic. How to liberate all sentient beings? Are we reading about that topic? Are we interplaying with the different realms we do have access to, maybe most readily the animal realm? I worry it's harder to address like, what you individually can/are willing to contribute.

>The secret is often quieting the mind when everybody wants to use their minds to calculate.

I sort of agree and understand, but I hope this is taken to be in appropriation with our environments interacting with other realms (in particular the animal realm, to name again, we probably step on insects daily.

Salman was supposed to play Shah Rukh Khan's character (Max) and he recommended Aishwarya to be cast for Priya Gill's role (Rosanne) which was Max's love interest. Priya Gill was cast as Shah Rukh's sister (Shirley). But since Rosanne's role was short, Aishwarya stole Priya Gill's role to become Shirley and forced Priya to become Rosanne which meant that Salman would now be Aishwarya's brother Max. 

Salman refused to play Aishwarya's brother and gave his role to his friend Shah Rukh Khan.

Aishwarya forcefully took Priya Gill's role because that role had these three songs:

•	Hai Mera Dil

•	Mere Khayalon Ki Malika

•	Hum To Dil Se Haare

Salman and Ash doing Josh is old news. But recently Ash also spoke about this during an interview with Faridoon. She mentioned Salman's name multiple times during the interview.

And her fan says she has never taken Salman's name after their breakup. LOL.

Ringmaster box reduces magic damage and prevents single targeting, but also disarms, silences, and mutes and can’t be removed instantly. Can reposition a little bit but benefits go away if you go too far. You can also still die to spells (my low hp teammate who got boxed after necro casted ult but before it hit still died learned that the hard way.) Meanwhile:

Shallow grave you can reposition, are not silenced/muted/disarmed, and cannot die bar 2 single ultimate spells in the entire game

Abba Aphotic Shield hard dispel means you can remove slows, STUNS, silences, dots, etc. while being able to reposition, absorb damage and distribute it to enemies, and are not silenced muted or disarmed

Disruption you can’t reposition, but removes all damage and targeting, creates illusions for additional damage and confusion, and can be used offensively for added versatility

Omni can grant both physical immunity and debuff immunity with a 60% magic resist and additional HP, all without any movement restrictions or any disarm/silence/mute.

To become consul, or any office really, the person HAD to be in Rome at the start of their term to gain their imperium and again at the end of their term to relinquish it (You were only elected for 1 year at a time, hence also why there was fucking about with how long February was for some who wanted to make more money/power during their term). Only after you gained your office could you then go to your assigned station. This meant you had to be in Rome during the new year, aka March 1. This system was not a problem in the early republican era, but after the Second Punic War, when Rome had gained control of large parts of Spain, this system began to have problems. 

When the Romans become more and more involved in putting down rebellions and war in Spain, the problem of being in Rome on March 1 meant that by the time you made it to Spain it was already much to late to do any major military campaigns before the weather was a problem. To compensate, the Romans switched the start of secular office to January 1 around the year 133 BC during a long war with Numatia in Spain in order to allow enough time for the new commander to reach Spain for the campaigning season.

Julius Caesar, with his calendar reforms, also changed the start of the religious calendar to January 1 which had been, I believe, March 15 (the infamous Ides of March). The assassins likely chose the date symbolically as propaganda for the restoration of the old Republic.

 Also, I will die on the hill that January did not get it's name until the calendar reforms of Caesar as a pure propaganda exercise of looking back at the old way and looking forward to the new with Caesar in charge. The Romans would have no need to call it January before then as when Numa Pompilius added to extra months to the Roman calendar, they were added at the end of the existing one (as you already know) and why February gets short-changed as the original last month, but it would have made no sense to call the month we now know as January after Janus during this period because it did not signify any meaningful transition.",1727740836.0

"CrestedGecko","t5_2vwdx","No, this is a terrible idea. Logistically, to build a water fall you need a dedicated resevoir that will take up room that takes away from the gecko. Then you also have the humidity issue someone else pointed out. Persistent high humidity = respiratory illness for your gecko. Then there's the CLEANING. You'll need to clean it pretty much every day because in a small volume, you will not have efficient enough bacterial filtration to maintain safe water quality for your gecko to drink, because they will drink from it. At some point, their poop will filter into it. If you want a waterfall, just set up a separate waterfall outside of the enclosure. 

The only way to do this safely long term is to build a giant enclosure so you have a moisture gradient and also a way to effectively filter your water. You're probably talking about the Dr. Plants video. Mourning geckos are one of the geckos that consistently break the rules on arboreal geckos. Do not follow that unless.. you do mourning geckos (they can deal with very high humidity better) and have the patience to cycle the water portion.

The term ""anime swordfighter"" is such a broad and loose term created by people to complain about characters they don't want in Smash getting in instead of being a meaningful term. The use of the term anime in this context basically comes down to the character being from japanese media as none of these characters are technically ""anime"" characters. And besides Ganondorf they all use swords with Pit's bow being able to split into blades making him debatable.

While Ganondorf uses a sword in his Smash attacks it is only in three moves while he primarily fights with his fists instead of his sword it's like calling the Belmonts sword fighters because they use one in their up special.",1727740837.0
"RedditReads","t5_33xfn","The legend of Bigfoot gets a bone-chilling update in this scary story about a young girl and her scout troop who are willing to brave the woods to find her missing friend when no one else will. 

Perfect for fans of Daka Hermon and Claribel A. 

Ortega!The wilderness is in Jenna’s blood. 

Her Pap was the first Black park ranger at Sturbridge Reservation, and she practically knows the Owlet Survival Handbook by heart. 

But she’s never encountered a creature like the one that took her best friend Reese. 

Her parents don’t believe her; the police are worthless, following the wrong leads; and the media isn’t connecting the dots between Reese’s disappearance and a string of other attacks. 

Determined to save her friend, Jenna joins a new local scout troop, and ventures back into the woods. 

When the troop stumbles across suspicious huge human-like footprints near the camp, scratch marks on trees, and ominous sounds from the woods, Jenna worries that whatever took Reese is back to take her too. 

Can she trust her new scout leader? And will her new friend Norrie—who makes her laugh and reminds her so much of Reese—believe her?After the unthinkable happens, the scouts, armed with their wits and toiletries, band together to fight the monster and survive the night.",1727740837.0

Продолжаем разбор

>инфантильное население такое

На основе чего был сделан такой вывод?

>Со временем потребность в размножении берет своё, и вступает в свои права суровый прагматизм

Ну во-первых давай обратимся к определению, собственно, прагматизма — это способность человека оценивать события и явления с точки зрения практической пользы. Прагматичный человек руководствуется разумом, а не чувствами и эмоциями.

По поводу потребности в размножении - это скорее следствие первичного полового влечения, что является комплексом желаний, имеющий в своей основе биологические инстинкты, направленные на воспроизведение жизни.

А теперь ВНИМАНИЕ - половое влечение включает стремление к половой близости, выраженность и направленность которого определяются генетическим набором хромосом, диэнцефальным отделом мозга, развитием желёз внутренней секреции и формированием условно-рефлекторных комплексов под влиянием индивидуального психосоциального опыта.",1727740838.0

"NonCredibleDefense","t5_i41xc","Alright ladies I know we all like to make fun of Russia but the only thing mildly bad here is that they didn't have a museum with water access to move the sub to or space in the dock to make one so they were forced to drag it on land. Most other countries just cordon off a part of the dock and make that a part of the museum if they don't have a naval museum with access to open water.

This is very similar to how any other nation, even the USA, would have done it if they would have to bring that submarine to an inland museum. 

With very similar vehicles too.

 Also despite the descriptions those are not tanks, those are dedicated engineering vehicles, obviously on tank chassis but still dedicated engineering vehicles. Everyone has them.

"sounddesign","t5_2s67n","If a product like that worked, it would be mostly editors and content creators using it putting sound designers out of work. So on self preservation grounds I'd be against it. I can imagine a world where, if it works as advertised,AI would further democratize media creation. Most pecialized skills would disappear and most people in the field would be content creators. That would mean a  ton of content (as if we're not saturated already) with most people not being able to monetize their work.  The aggregates and tool creators (ai companies) would make a killing. If you value democratization of creation above all other things then that's good. If you think a functional economy is more evenly distributed then this then it's not so good. Regardless, I have my doubts on how well it would work. How much creative control would you have over the sounds made? How would you even verbalize what you wanted in a way the AI could get you what you wanted? More likely, it would be a ""you get what you get"" type scenario. Amazing in theory and some applications but ultimately impractical any creative work.",1727740838.0

#NEW VIDEOS AND AUDIOS (Updated Weekly) (All Content is 18+ Only)

##Let's Destroy Men!

I have been waiting SO long to get into this position of power! Now I can finally put my plans into motion and destroy men! Women have always been superior, men are so weak and pathetic. I am finally going to be able to get all my friends together and convince the female population that we need to degrade, torment and abuse men. I am so, so ready to destroy all those stupid penises and testicles, I have zero use for them! Men deserve to be humiliated, objectified, and disposed of in the most cruel and funny ways!

##MILF Helps You Cum

I know it might be embarrassing to talk about, but we do need to discuss what I walked in on the other day. Trust me, it’s ok if you want to masturbate, it’s totally normal, even I do it! But the thing that confused me, is that you were in such an interesting position…. Oh, you were pointing your dick at your own mouth because you eat your own loads? Wow… I would LOVE to watch you do that for me. I would absolutely love to redo walking in on you and this time it will go differently. I want to watch you stroke and tease yourself before you explode right into your own mouth. I then want you to hold it there and enjoy the taste while I touch myself and make myself cum!

##Step-Mom Hires Virginity Escort

I've been hired by your Step-Mother with a request I've never gotten before! She explained that you turned 18 four months ago and still haven't lost your virginity. You are very shy and rarely get outside, let alone to social events or parties. As such, she is very concerned about you!! I've been paid handsomely to come to your home in the evening and take your pesky virginity. This is a very noble goal, of course, and I'm going to give it my all to make sure you have the best first time ever! (At least my definition of a best first time…)

##I'm Stripping Away Your Foreskin

I know that I have been cucking you since the very beginning of our relationship, but my friends and my bull have all been encouraging me to take it to the next step. All my girl friends have never understood why I got with you, they all know about your small, gross uncut dick. They finally understood when I told them about how I cuck you. But now, everyone has made me aware that I can get your disgusting foreskin cut off! So I booked a surgery and I will be taking you with me, so I can decide how much to get cut off. Don’t worry, I want it high and tight, no more loose skin! I want to make sure that all of that sensitivity disappears after I take it all away from you. And don’t worry, our cuckold relationship won’t change, I still won’t be fucking you even once you’re circumcised.

##The Ballbuster Chronicles

Yes, I am a ballbuster, but you should probably refer to me as a castrater though. I love squishing those weak, pathetic balls between a guys legs. It all started when I saw my Step-Mom do it. Slapping balls and testicles when punishment was needed, despite me usually also getting my butt spanked. I learned that she loved doing it and showing me how. I learned from the best! But the most prominent memory I have was when I was babysitting a little pervert. When he grabbed my tits, I knew he needed a proper lesson and I wanted to kick his nuts until they were mush with my bare feet!

##I Won't Cheat On You Again

Oh babe… I really didn’t think that you would discover that I had cheated on you. I am so, SO sorry, it really meant nothing. (Well, I want you to think that, but wow his cock is so much better than yours…) I promise I would never, ever cheat again! (until tomorrow that is….) I swear that I’ll make this up to you, (while I continue my affairs behind your back) maybe I could set up a threesome with one of my friends to make it up to you. (Let’s not talk about how I have done plenty with her along side the guy I’ve been cheating on you for years with!)

##Step-Sister Catches You In Her Panties

Sigh… Are you really wearing my missing pair of panties right now?!? You are so disgusting, honestly, I can’t believe you’re jerking off with them on… You know what, as punishment, I am going to make you wear this cum filled, used condom that I just brought home after fucking my boyfriend. Haha, you can’t even fill the condom out, your dick is SO much smaller than he is. He not only stretched that condom out, he pumped it full of a massive load of cum! And don’t worry, the actual punishment starts now that I forced you to ruin yourself into the condom. I’m going to empty the whole thing into your mouth and make you clean out both loads for me!

##I Love Big Porn Star Dicks!

What can I say, I’m a Size Queen! I am so lucky that I have such a fun career as a porn star and have been able to fuck so many big dicks. I have like 5 different ones that really stand out to me as being especially special. I can’t believe I have had the chance to cum on so many different monster sized dicks. Long, thick or chode, they all feel so amazing! But I do have to admit, your ginormous cock is unbelievably big, definitely the biggest I have ever had!

##Bully Reminds You of Your Protection Deal

Standing up to your bully didn't go as planned, of course! Did you really think that she would just excuse the deal you made so long ago? Of course your bully has to remind you of what life was like before you started doing all her homework… Get ready for some nice big wedgies and swirlies, dork!! It will be so, so embarrassing to have to walk through the school halls all wet after, maybe you should have thought this through better.

1. Turn off learning any new words for the foreseeable future. 
2. If your decks are Japanese -> English then clone those decks and make an English -> Japanese deck. 
3. I would recommend a 'good' being spelling the words with hiragana or katakana correctly. I personally use an online keyboard and always use hiragana unless its a katakana word.
4. I would also recommend an audio only deck with example sentences and marking yourself wrong on homonyms if you guessed wrong, since your example sentences should allow you to figure this out

You'd be better off sending 50 proposals per month (even less than that, but if you have to try, 50 is better than 200) and actually spending time on making those proposals solid and on finding clients that are actually looking to hire someone and are not just looking to rip someone off or are stealing proposals, checking the market and other bullshit. Upwork has become ostensibly harder and harder to find actual quality jobs, but sending too many uncalculated proposals that are not thought through is not a way to go. Try to find the jobs that seem so specific that you are perfect for it (meaning you have done that exact same thing before, and maybe you can even identify how you can improve upon what they already have). I can't blame you because Upwork is hard on everyone these days and making living is next to impossible, but no mater how you slice it, what you're doing is not the way to go. Lastly, don't fall for generated job descriptions. If a person says that they're offering 15-40$/h pay and their average hourly pay is 5-10$/h on a 40% hire rate, then run.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","> Taxing them will not provide the revenues we need to secure our entitlements (social security, Medicare, medicate) — there aren’t enough billionaires.

Simple. Every dollar made of $999,999,999 is taxed at one hundred percent. Using Musk, that puts roughly $269B back into state/federal coffers that should be ear marked for social safety net programs. Like free childcare so that young mothers and fathers can got to school or work towards making their lives better. 


>And I think public education is being destroyed by the culture war and woke nonsense as much as anything else. Everyone has a bias and we no longer er have a common identity that binds us together. This is what happens when 28 year old college grade are teaching our elementary school children identity politics and the demonization of our society — something you’ve been riffing on.

Some people are gay; some people are transgender. These people exist and pay taxes just like you. They have always existed and been an integral part of our society. What is the issue with teaching kids these people exist and that it's okay to be gay or transgender (while keeping religion out of it)? And demonization of our society? How so? By teaching the true history of this country? What if I told you, in my opinion, one can only be a true patriot if you look at your country for all of its faults and are still proud of the great things it has done? Maybe if we actually taught real history, there wouldn't be a man running for president who has no moral right to do so. (Remember when lying about a blowjob was the worse thing a President could do?) 


>I exist in this world and I see how people operate — many of them are fucking nuts,  and they love to latch on to this song and dance your performing so they can blame someone else for the fact that they got $250,000 in debt while doing nothing but partying and sometimes attending class and then got a degree in English or Gender Studies and can’t find a job. Sorry folks you should have looked out at the real world before signing up to be the one that’s going to save it.

Now, we've gotten this far without using ad hominem attacks. 

An English degree is a baseline degree. Not everyone can go into STEM because we need teachers, social workers, airline pilots, and, and, and.... If everyone is a doctor, who is going to work at the bank when you go to cash your checks? 


What I'm hearing is that you prefer things the way they *were*, not what they *are*, and certainly not what things are *becoming*. And I get the feeling that you are older than I am, so consider this intergenerational advice: The kids coming up behind us don't care if we don't like how they're changing things.

Right.. Where does that feeling come from? Is there an epidemic of white male teenangers sincerely showing up for organizing meetings or phone banks and being shown the door?

There is not

That feeling comes from lies. It comes from being told by the conservative (Russian) disinfo ecosystem, over and over again, that ""Democrats are ignoring you"", literally at the same time that Democrats are the only ones doing the things that young white dudes care about, like increasing availability of education and job opportunities (including trades), increasing the minimum wage, and legalizing weed, porn, birth control, and abortion

That feeling shifts focus away from the people who are spreading the lies that are the source of those ""feelings"". As long as you do that, you're never going to solve the problem, because the young white dudes you're talking about are just going to believe the lies over anything you say",1727740841.0

"WeatherGifs","t5_39geq","I live in the CSRA (bright dot in the middle of the GA/SC border the goes almost black). We got absolutely wrecked. Hundreds of trees down across roads, powerlines laying g in yards, the worst I've seen ever in 30yrs of living in SC. 

 The houses on either side of me got theside of their roofs facing the winds basically completely ripped off down to the plywood. I heard big shit hitting my roof from 3-6am on Friday and was like ""that can't be good"" because we live in a new development with no trees. 

I got lucky, our house only is missing a few shingles and had power restored by mid Friday morning since our neighborhood is close to the substation for our area and was able to get switched back to a line that didn't get taken out. 

Almost everyone I know was without power since Friday, probably a bit more than half the folks I know have gotten it back by tonight. The people who live out of town a bit will be out til the end of the week most likely.  Some of the municipalities ran out of diesel fuel and had to shut down backup generators for water supplies.

Yes, you can get higher returns elsewhere.

Yes, you can assemble and monitor your own portfolio of stocks you consider ethical.

Yes, you can invest in other ETFs with the word 'ethical' in them. They might align sufficiently with your values, and they might have higher net returns.

Yes, there is debate about whether investing in an 'ethical' fund makes any difference.

But for me, this is a good option that does the work I need done for a price I am willing to pay, and reports pretty transparently what they are doing.

"chevyspark","t5_31xe6","the most important factor in collisions is speed.  a spark is still 2500 lbs that’s plenty enough to cause damage if you’re going fast.  

smaller is safer in a couple ways.  you’re maneuverable with a shorter wheelbase and lighter car, so you can avoid accidents especially things like parking lot accidents.  lower mass means there’s less force involved in any collision for both cars.   

small cars are less safe primarily in that they don’t have as much of a front crumple zone.   cars have gotten heavier which is more dangerous but heavy cars still have the same crash safety standards so they’ve compensated by having larger and more effective crumple zones.  so if you’re in two Suburbans and they get in a head on collision at 65mph everybody will probabaly both walk away fine.  if one hits the other on the side the one that receives the impact will be obliterated because sides are not able to compensate as much.   

a lot of fatalities are also pedestrians so smaller is better there. even if you do have an accident it’s less likely to be severe.  this is particularly bad for large suvs.  so you’re getting slammed but also higher on the body.  you’re more likely to survive a hit in the lower extremities because it kind of tosses you over the car.",1727740843.0

"ComfortLevelPod","t5_7l71ng","Everyone in these comments seems to want to make this some kind of petty revenge. The dude has already suffered the consequence of having little to no good memories with his children, and a wife that clearly doesn't need him.

I think a slap in the face, ""it's your job now since I make most of the money"" would be a terrible way to approach the situation.

OP, if you truly want the best outcome for yourself. I would be honest and adjust your responses and environment based on his reaction. 

Tell him the truth, ""hey I got a promotion and I'm now making more money. WE can accomplish OUR goals for retirement that much sooner, thank you for your continued support all these years.""

There is no need to mention that it's more money than him because it's not a competition. He'll find out eventually and if he has a poor reaction his true intentions and values will be revealed and you'll need to make a decision.

On the issue of dividing up the housework. I would be honest about that too and set him down easy, ""Hey since I'm making more money now I was thinking we could discuss having you take on some tasks around the house.""

If he gets all defensive and ultimately creates a double standard (ie. He tries to retire or comes up with an excuse to avoid housework) Then you really need to decide if you want to stay with him or not.

If he ultimately uses these deflection tactics it becomes clear he thinks the wife should do all the work and just never made that directly clear. Or he is just extremely lazy and has been covering it up by using the gool old ""I make more money"" excuse.

You clearly don't NEED him for financial purposes.

Like other comments have said, you can take your portion of the equity in a divorce and take care of yourself. Or make the ultimate sacrifice and deal with his bullshit (FYI, you don't deserve it and are not obligated to stay with him especially if your children are out of the nest and he deflects responsibility like I mentioned before.)

You have to consider your willingness to deal with his bullshit, and compare it to the risk of him otherwise tarnishing your relationship with your kids, sabotaging your work/career, or deflecting what should ultimately be his responsibilities (all the housework) considering you were under the same standard by his words.

You played this well OP. Keep going, you got this!",1727740843.0

"Roofing","t5_2s0ys","“Then why did multiple roofers..” I don’t speak for them. Ask them. I can only speak on my experience and how I operate my business. 

As for me, if I know insurance is involved then I’ll ask a few simple questions before writing an estimate and I’ll even be upfront about my estimate being more than the insurance quote and probably more than any one else they will speak to. It is very relevant. At the end of the day, if you can’t grasp that then I won’t waste my time and I’ll move on. It’s simply not worth my time in a CAT situation. 

I gave you an example of depreciation and how it affects pricing and the reasoning behind not wasting your time on estimates unless an insurance claim is really geared in your favor to do that, which it rarely is. 

Simple questions: 

do you know your deductible amount?

Do you have any depreciation on the claim and do you know if it’s recoverable or non-recoverable? 

Do you fully understand the insurance estimate or have any questions about that estimate or the process?

I’m happy to write you an estimate but it’s going to be higher than what your insurance company quoted. I use the same exact software as them (Xactimate) and I write for an actual full replacement without cutting any corners or re-using any items. I also write for code required items that may not currently be on your roof. This of course will take me some time to draft up but I am happy to do it. If I do all the work of writing up a proper contract price (not just bs ‘estimate’ scribbled on a piece of paper), will you then allow me to show you the options we have completing this project for insurance proceeds? I’ll give you a hard dollar price and that won’t change, if you will let me show you how it’s much better for you to allow me to see that paperwork. 

I’ll fully explain the paperwork line item by line item. Things like depreciation, what each item actually is. What is missing and should be included. Etc. 

I’ll answer your bolded question but first, let’s fix the terminology. An estimate is a guess. It’s an approximation. Only an idiot (on either side) would commence work based solely on an estimate. If we have a signed contract for an agreed amount and the work is complete, I won’t even look at the paperwork. Don’t even hand it to me because I don’t care. I don’t care what documentation the insurance company is requesting at completion. I don’t care about your depreciation or whatever money you saved, or think you saved… again, depreciation. That’s your job. My job is done so pay the contact amount and do whatever you want after. You’ll get a certificate of completion, receipt, and warranty documents. That’s it. So do I change my contract price after doing exactly what I agreed to? Of course not. That’s not how it works. Obviously.",1727740843.0

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","Telling yourself to forget something is only reinforcing your memory of it because you’re recalling it each time you think of forgetting it. Instead of obsessively wanting to forget it, simply carry on with life and you’ll become preoccupied with other things that push the show out of your immediate focus. Trying to forget something is like trying to keep a toddler from saying a bad word, the more you keep giving it attention, the more it’s gonna stick around. It’s a paradox.

"ar15","t5_2reap","Crimson trace CMR 201 Rail Master. You can find them for $100-$130ish. I've got one on a 14.5. Holds zero at 25 yards shooting offhand. I've never rested it but I've got close to 1k rounds through the gun with it mounted and it still holds zero. Takes up almost no rail space.

It adds almost no weight, and it is ergonomically easy to use, depending on the light setup you've got.

After handling my gun with this laser a lot of people have added it to their setup. The penalty for cost, weight and space is pretty minimal.

This looks interesting if you want a different activation. Personally, I still like the rail master.

2) Walk two blocks west on Mt. Royal Avenue (after going 1/2 block south from Penn Station on Charles Street) to  the University of Baltimore/Mt. Royal light rail station.  Your WMATA SmarTrip card can be used on the light rail.

3) Go south on the light rail to OPACY.

4) Do the steps in reverse when the game ends.

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","But that was the point... no one ever ""forced"" me to join anything. I have been left alone and I still play games all the time.

People talking crap and making lies up about public figures like YouTubers and Streamers is about as old as time, and literally every one of these people has a parasocial relationship with their viewers. You literally don't know who these YouTubers are in their off time and couldn't vouch for their character or activities anyway. No one ""had"" to do anything about it.

Everything else here is just Gamergate-to-Trumper pipeline crap. From ""welcome to the war soldier"" as though this were some kind of violent worldwide battle and we are all ""forced"" to fight against ""them."" Literally no one is trying to alter ""your"" history and future into some kind of... I don't even know there is no boogeyman here other than the implied hatred of ""them.""

This post says ""the other side hates you just for who you are and they will not leave you alone."" I have a question for ""Gamergators"": Have you ever even tried to just ignore the YouTube nonsense and just play the games you enjoy? How about try it out now? Just give it a year, try ignoring YouTube, maybe just listen to music, browse your Steam/Nintendo/Playstation collection, pick a game that just sounds fun regardless of what ""messaging"" it supposedly has, and just... play it?

Look...you're entitled to believe whatever you want.  However, it's amply obvious that you're arguing from your ego and seek only to be right rather than to simply pursue knowledge for the sake of truth and knowledge itself.  

If you knew anything about science you'd know that it's constantly evolving and consistently wrong. All the bullshit ""science"" produced during covid should have reinforced everyone's distrust for mainstream science considerably more.  

Just THINK for a minute rather than act like petulant child.  Do you really believe that  mainstream researchers are going to get be allowed to publish, much less get funding for research that condemns the immutable field of wireless technology??? The cat is forever out of the bag.  The line must be toed or else.

"endometriosis","t5_2z46j","So honest answer is nothing worked fully until I had surgery to get the growths out but before that what I've been making and still do even after surgery is ginger tea.

I don't buy a pre made tea. I get a chunk of ginger root, peel it (easy to peel with a spoon) and then take a medium sized pot I fill with the top with water. Turn it on to boil with the ginger root chunks in it (I take my meat mallet and wack it a couple times to open up the ginger fibres more) once it's boiling i turn it to simmer until the water goes down by half.

When that's all done I add a lemon slice and honey and drink as much of it as I can (normally the pot) and it's worked for so many things and kept me from having to take so much OTC stuff. Even when you have a cold / flu drinking that back and just making it stronger with as much ginger as you can handle to taste, has worked better for so many things. 

It's a natural anti inflammatory and anti bacterial. Really helps to just fight off whatever is angry in there whether it's a virus or a growth. 

This in no way fixes any of the Endo issues but it's a really good natural way to handle some of the symptoms without adding OTC stuff that can make your stomach lining sore. My bloat always improves when I make the tea and I'm pretty well positive it's just the natural properties of the ginger working on the swelling. 

Also a great hangover cure lmao.",1727740845.0

"GirlGamers","t5_2rfec","I have put a few thousand hours into D2 since covid lockdown started. Like others have said the D2 new player experience is not great, however, it has massively improved since i started. i created a new character and went through it all last expansion and it was much more manageable than previous. Especially with the change where your power level gets raised up to close to the highest in your team. It makes it much more fun to go through the standard content. 

D2 is undergoing some major restructuring right now since the main saga ended and now we are in a bit of an in between until the new stuff really kicks off. There is a new Game director that has been making some great changes and i am finally optimistic for the future of the game. 

D2s past expansions are kind of a mess to figure out what you need to buy but honestly it is Free to try with plenty of content that will give you an idea of the gameplay works for you. It is definitely one of those games where you will have more fun playing with others but there is plenty that can be done solo until you find your crowd. 

PvP is in the roughest shape out of the whole game but a lot of the problems won’t really impact a newer player since everything will be new anyway. The pvp team seems to finally be back on track to improve the experience but the sandbox shifts pretty regularly that if you don’t like one thing it isn’t long before they do a rebalance anyway. At least u til you get to a high skill bracket then every tiny imbalance gets frustrating. 

If you do decide to try it i am always down to run through stuff with new lights and help teach the systems. I have done it with lots of people in the server i play in. 

The Halloween event starts in a few weeks and i think that is a great time to give it a shot since the event has some fun things for new players. At least the last few years. We haven’t gotten the details on this year’s festival. 

If you give it a try and fall in love with the gunplay ( and fashion. that is the true endgame) the past expansions go on sale regularly this time of year. and if you are on playstation i think some of them are in the ps+ catalogue.",1727740846.0

"foxholegame","t5_3ejda","That’s the thing though, it isn’t MORE effective, it’s a different role that at the end of day does some things different and some similar to at least sometimes equal or greater effect.

I’ve run plenty of arty and mortar halftracks and had fun doing both. Sometimes I like to load and click while we delete concrete no one else can or totally render a bridge or choke point unusable to the enemy. Sometimes I want to dart around the front, help infantry gain ground, be an active presence moving with a biomass as we push together or just rain shrapnel with mobile accuracy and shred a bridge or choke point so the enemy can’t do a thing.

4 people running arty or 4 rotating mortars is probably more effective than 4 guys running with an argenti and 2 clips into the trenches. It doesn’t mean either of us would rather no one grab an argenti and we all try to arty or mortar with no inf support. 

People do different things for different reasons, let’s be honest often to very poor effect! That’s fine!",1727740847.0

I think right now is a fantastic time to return to the game for what it's worth - so it's awesome you got this gift! (Whoever gifted it to you is an awesome person, haha)

I think your goal one should just be to enjoy the basic content of the game. So like you're doing now, just level a character, or maybe a few. Whether that be purely questing, doing dungeons, or a mix of both.

I personally took a good bit of time when I returned to get a good sense of how I enjoy the current state of all the classes.

That alone was a lot of fun. I didn't necessarily cap all of them by any means, but played enough to get a vibe for the class/spec.

Then once you figure out a class you want to main, definitely get them to max level and give some end-game content a shot. Whether that be raiding, mythic dungeons, or PvP.

Oh and final thing, keep an eye out for players you end up engaging with and enjoy. See if you can join their guild if you do.

Welcome back, enjoy it out there!",1727740849.0

"latvia","t5_2rwqy","This is nothing. I was having a road trip through southern France some years ago. Driving at around 80-110 km/h on the narrow windy roads they have there and there was a constant tail within a couple of meters behind me. Not just one, but like 4 or 5 cars tailing each other. I can understand that locals drive through these roads daily and know every bump on the road, but it pissed me off big time. If I had to stop suddenly, we would have had a wreckfest.

  
Answering to your question, this is almost normal here. She wanted to drive like her husband and neighbour does, but was afraid to pass for far too long. I don't want to sound stereotypical, but quite a lot of women (and elderly) in Latvia are very flimsy drivers. Very often you can see them hugging the right side line, because they're too afraid of oncoming traffic, sitting behind lorries or other smaller cars for eternity and not understanding basic distances you should take to drive safe and be safe. 



But this is only a part of the bigger problem, which is the driving culture in Latvia in general. A lot of people think they're the best drivers the world has ever seen and everybody else is merely an NPC. So they speed wherever it's possible, cut off other people wherever to gain miliseconds, just to meet again at a traffic light. Overtake cars at places where they can't even see oncoming traffic. It's getting better over the years, but we still have a long way to go.

  
P.S. I might be biased, but I keep noticing the worst behaviour on the road exactly around Tukums. They're probably eating some Chernobyl mushrooms over there or something. Riga as well, of course, but that place is doomed anyway.",1727740850.0

Japan's acceptable testosterone range is the average testosterone levels from all people from puberty to geriatric. 


Their healthy range has been tainted by the fact testosterone levels decrease from 30-99 years old.

So their average ends up being somewhere around the healthy range for a 50 year old, which is not ideal for a 30 year old.

for the most part the characters act like normal adults but the story also jumps around a bit more than I’d like but it’s an above average fantasy romance

the ML cornering her to marry also gave me the ick but the story slowly shows you that they were quite in love as kids in school but he was doing the old pride and prejudice thing and she didn’t want to train him to be better so she just ditched his ass after school and when they hooked up after a party she ditched him again (lol)

he then spent years lamenting that he couldn’t just let go of his pride and date her honestly, so when she shows up with the kid he uses the child as impetus to pressure her, but then he realizes the kid isn’t his and still pursues her and let’s go of his pride in this regard. The FL also had to relax her pride as well to accept him, and in the end they’re both on board with the marriage

he also properly cares for the kid because he’s her kid, and she tells him her suspicions about the kid being the dead prince’s son and they both actively hide that information because it’s safer for the kid

"canadaleft","t5_z158t","I was listening to a CBC radio episode earlier today and one of the people they interviewed was talking about how it's symbolic for RCMP to walk with survivors home because they did the opposite when they were kids. Shortly after she admitted that she doesn't even identify as indigenous, just her cop father. It was incredibly embarrassing hearing that. Usually CBC does better than that. 

I think Orange Shirt Day is like having Pride displayed in June. It's something nice that previous generations would be happy to know we have now, it was unimaginable in their lifetimes, and in the very least reflects a marketable favourability of these minorities to the general public. 

What should be especially cautioned against however is any teleological conclusions about how we are progressing. Just because there's an apparent change for the better doesn't mean it was always going to happen, doesn't mean it will continue to get better. You can easily prove this by comparing TRC progress on the site provided. Incarceration rates of indigenous people from 2015 to 2021 went from 24.4% to 32%!

"22lr","t5_2rmjw","What ever gun you have has to b*e reasonably matched and in proportion to your Skill and Physical Abilities.*

*A Gun you CAN and WILL shoot is always better than a Gun you are Afraid to shoot.* 

On one hand, people have taken down 400 Wild Boars with a 22lr. And in another incident I am aware of, a woman took down a Grizzly Bear, not with a 22lr, but merely a 22L. A one shot drop. 

I think if it is possible to take down a 400 pound Wild Boar with a 22lr, it will probably do OK against a 150 pound man. 

While a 22lr is certainly functional for Defensive use, it is perhaps not ideal. Most people would be inclined to use a 9mm. 

But there is N*o One Size Fits All.* 

What you choose is very much dependent on you physical abilities and any physical limitations. 

And it is dependent on your circumstances. What I would recommend is an Apartment is different than what I would recommend in a Rural House. 

There are many factors that have to be considered before you use a gun Defensively. 

* Are there alternatives?
* Are there effective routes of escape? 
* Have you worked out *Safe Lanes of Fire* in advance? 
* Are you skilled and strong enough to use a higher caliber, or are more comfortable and effective with a 22LR? 
* And a lot of other factors.

If my choice are Defend the Life of Myself, my Friends, and my Family, and a 22lr is what I have, then that is what I'm using. It is an effective tool, even if it is not generally the ideal tool. Though perhaps, when all things are considered, a 22lr might actually be the ideal tool for a given individual. 

You ask - ***What would you use?*** 

Are you asking for the Type of Gun, that is, *Rifle or Pistol.* 

Or are you asking for Specific Guns as in *Taurus TX22, Ruger Mark-IV, Ruger 10/22, and similar.* 

When I imagine such a scenario, I imagine myself using a Pistol about 80% of the time, and a Rifle about 20% of the time. 

A Pistol is much easier to maneuver in tight spaces. With a Long Rifle, you are likely knocking over vases and lamps as you swing it around. However, a Rifle is easier to aim and shoot accurately, so it is something of a trade off. 

Fortunately, such a situation has never arisen, so I have not had to test the effectiveness.",1727740850.0

"shittymoviedetails","t5_3mj3w","Even the idea of a rock band being a continuous lineup with nearly full creative control over their own output was something that only really happened because of the Beatles.

The standard in the music industry before that time was a singer (or sometimes a prominent instrumentalist) and a backing band performing a mix of old standards and new songs usually written by journeyman industry songwriters. Sometimes bands would stay together between tours and albums with just the odd session musician subbed in here and there, but this was the exception rather than the rule. And sometimes they'd perform their own songs, but we're talking like one or two every album.

I mean, the Beatles didn't single-handedly originate the idea of a band that stays together and exclusively performs their own music with each album seen as a singular cohesive work of art - that shift was already underway in the early 60's when they were just starting out - but they got so big by taking this approach that the whole industry changed around them as a result.",1727740851.0

Both are cunning strategic reincarnations of Godlike beings of hatred no Madara and Hashirama are reincarnations of two brothers who have a curse of hatred and are fated to fight each other. Madara is not the reincarnation of hatred itself Indra is not the curse of hatred itself.


Both were prodigies at war with an opposition group and would later make peace with that group but they use this piece to use about their plans ( the Triforce for Gannon Madara his vision of peace) 

. No madara didn’t form the leaf village for his plan he formed it because he genuinely believed in it. While he and Hashirama had disagreements it was Zeztu altering the tablet that made him leave it would have been way better for Madara if he didn’t form it as that way he wouldn’t have major opposition.

"PossibleHistory","t5_6c3dcw","So I think I'm south italy so this is my rp:

1. The Rise of a new Oppressor Pietro Badoglio, start new corrupt Policies



#### 2. Systematic Corruption

The goverment embeds corruption deep within the political system. Key government officials are bribed to overlook illegal activities, including:

- **Money Laundering:** The party’s leaders establish a vast network of shell companies to launder money from illegal arms deals and organized crime.
- **Kickbacks:** Major infrastructure projects are inflated in cost, with lucrative kickbacks flowing back to the NRF, ensuring their power and wealth.

#### 3. The Suppression of Dissent

To maintain control, the italian goverment employs brutal tactics against opposition:

- **Media Manipulation:** State-controlled media spreads propaganda, while independent journalists face intimidation, imprisonment, or worse.
- **Political Purges:** Anyone opposing the NRF is labeled a traitor, leading to a series of disappearances that instill fear in the populace.

#### 4. Exploiting the Mafia

Rather than combatting organized crime, the Italian government forms an alliance with the Mafia, granting them protection in exchange for political favors. This partnership fuels:

- **Drug Trafficking:** Italy becomes a major hub for drug trafficking into Europe, with profits funneled back to only the goverment.
- **Violence and Control:** The Mafia uses violence to eliminate rivals and enforce the goverment power, creating a climate of terror.

#### 5. International Manipulation

The Italian goverment seeks to expand its influence beyond Italy’s borders:

- **Covert Operations:** The party funds extremist groups in neighboring countries, destabilizing governments and creating new markets for illicit trade.
- **Diplomatic Deceit:** Italy's leaders manipulate international relations, presenting a façade of democracy while engaging in backdoor deals that undermine European unity.

#### 6. A Culture of Fear

As corruption escalates, citizens become increasingly disillusioned. A culture of fear permeates society:

- **Surveillance State:** The government implements mass surveillance programs, monitoring citizens to preempt dissent.
- **Civic Apathy:** The public, worn down by fear and corruption, withdraws from political engagement, allowing the goverment to tighten its grip.

#### 7. The Legacy of Darkness


- **Authoritarian Rule:** The goverment reforms transitions into a de facto authoritarian regime, with elections merely a formality.
- **Cultural Decay:** Art, literature, and free thought are stifled, replaced with state-sponsored propaganda celebrating the regime.

Although, there may be a way you can help. Check for a zoos near you, they may have a program where they do a study on turtle road mortality. John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids Michigan is doing a study by collecting data through iNaturalist on how many turtles are hit and where. The hope is with enough data they can petition the road commission to start adding signs (better than nothing, might save a few) and potentially under road tunnels to mitigate the problem.

But small claims court (of all places) is not going to anal-retentively legalistically parse OP's tenant's settlement request like that.

I have eye contact aversion, even with people I'm close to. I just let them know that's what I'm like and they can accept it or not, but I'm not changing. I don't see it as a bad thing to not like eye contact. To me it feels incredibly physically uncomfortable to have someone looking at me for anything more than a brief glance, much less looking back at them for more than a moment. 

I don't think not looking at someone is showing them you're afraid of them. It can mean so many things, starting with a simple message of not wanting interaction. Even if it does mean you're afraid, there's no need to make that eye contact if you don't want to. Fear is a legitimate emotion to experience, especially when you've dealt with trauma.",1727740853.0

Ich verstehe auch dieses Narrativ nicht, das immer wieder angebracht wird, das Spiele immer schlechter werden. Nichts könnte weiter entfernt von der Realität sein. Wir haben eine nie dagewesen Vielfalt von Spielen in vielen verschiedenen Genre aus denen wir uns etwas aussuchen können. Man kann gar nicht mehr alles spielen was rauskommt, so viel Gutes gibt es (und ja, auch von großen Studios, sogar mit enormer Regelmäßigkeit).

Ich würde sogar fast soweit gehen, dass wir uns in einem der besten Zeitalter befinden die es bisher für Videospiele gegeben hat.

Wir können alte Spiele hochskaliert in 4k zocken; können das sogar unterwegs auf dem Steam Deck tun. Wir haben ein mobiles Gerät wie das Steam Deck, welches komplett offen ist und auf vielfältige Art genutzt werden kann Spiele zu spielen. Wir haben immer noch Nintendo, die es immer noch schaffen regelmäßig Klassiker zu produzieren. Wir haben eine gigantische Auswahl an (auch guten) Indie Games. Wir haben geniale Simulatoren wie MS Flight Simulator, von denen wir früher nur geträumt hätten! Die großen Studios schaffen auch regelmäßig immer noch Megahits, auch wenn viele diese gerne übersehen wollen.

Ja es ist nicht alles toll, ich bin auch kein Fan von Free-to-Play und Microtransaktionen. Aber die Vielfalt ist so groß, dass ich diese Spiele einfach ignorieren kann und trotzdem genug Auswahl habe.

Es gab nie einen besseren Zeitpunkt Videospiele zu spielen als jetzt.",1727740853.0
"expats","t5_2rhwp","There are entire University degrees about this. You can get a Bachelor's, Masters, or PhD studying this. It is such a dense topic. I could not due the uniqueness of the Black American experience justice as a reddit comment.

If you are just trolling, then ok. Whatever.

If you are seriously wanting to know… I suggest exploring the history. There are a lot of movies and documentaries.

The one small thing I will say as just one little example of the uniqueness is that we are probably one of the very people, maybe only, in the World that are totally cut off from any idea of our roots and mother land. Even White Americans and Jews know a bit about their families origin. You can meet a White American and they can say, oh Im Irish, Dutch, and  whatever. 

Black Americans cannot. Our memory of who we are in terms of a homeland is a totally gone. And that has a real psychological effect. That alone makes our experience very unique compared to most other peoples in the world. This is because when the slaves were brought over they were intentionally mixed together from different regions in Africa so that the slaves could not speak to each other in a common native tongue. And with that we lost a lot of oral history. 

The reason this is truly unique from what happened to the slaves in the other parts of the Americas is because in South and Central America they integrated and mixed and became absorbed into the dominant national culture with the European colonizers and the native Indians to the point that that they formed a whole new cultural identity as Brazilian first, or Columbian first, etc. In those parts of the New World, race/ color became secondary or tertiary, to nationality. Unlike in the USA where we were so segregated culturally and physically for so long that our cultural remained highly separate and distinct but without any anchoring origin place. In the Carribbean it is different also but again this is reddit not a history of the diasporas.

Like I said you can get an entire PhD in this. That is one teeny tiny tiny part of how our a people have a unique culture and history. 

I do agree that our condition is also our privilege in some respects. By being segregated so long in a globally dominant nation, means that we have built up a lot of social capital as a people and by being forced to be self-reliant for most of the centuries and bringing our own advancement and civil rights. So now that we do have them in this wealthy nation it does mean we now have a certain hard fought degree of privilege compared to the post-colonial Africa and Carribean nations and compared to highly the integrated but still marginalized Black Hispanic populations.

What does this all mean? It means its a very unique world view. Of truly only knowing the USA as our home. Only having an American nationhood identity. But also not being totally accepted here. But also having a relatively higher economic position and educational level than many other Blacks in the world (even though we are disproportionately more poor and under-educated compared to our white counterparts here in the US).",1727740853.0

> Buffy just never takes anything Spike does as seriously as the writers and viewers and other characters in the show do. Not even as seriously as Spike does. That is consistent throughout their relationship.

"chess","t5_2qhr7","> Alireza is insanely good at blitz/rapid; much better than Naka and second only to Magnus.

What are you basing this on? 

In their head-to-head over the last few years in rapid, Nakamura is +6 (36 wins, 20 losses, 20 draws). 

I would agree with the sentiment that they are rivals or peers in rapid... or even ""+6 over 76 games is too close to call""...  but saying Firouzja is ""much better"" than Nakamura when he has a losing record against him seems like a huge stretch. 

> But in classical, he’s equal to a whole group of people (Ian, Fabi, Gukesh, Ding, Pragg, etc). 

I'm also not really sure this is true either... Alireza is -8 vs this group of players you list in classical in the last few years... with Ding being the only player with a negative store against him (Naka +3, Nepo +3, Caruana +5, Gukesh +0, ding -4, Prag +1)",1727740855.0

"bladerunner","t5_2s7py","Quite simply it flopped because of bad writing and it isn't nearly as amazing as it is made out to be. I keep seeing people praising it and to be fair I decided to rewatch it to find out if I had been too harsh only to reaffirm my opinions of why the writing and the movie by extension are so bad.

Procreation, the ability to reproduce, is a biological function only organic life is capable of achieving. In this mess of a movie it is revealed that Tyrell Corp from the original movie had figured out how to give the ability to procreate to the replicants, but that secret is lost when Tyrell Corp goes bankrupt. It should be noted that Blade Runner (1982) never hinted that such a thing could even be possible for the andoids.

This premise is idiotic. It is true that the replicants are ""bioengineered"", meaning organic tissue is used in their manufacture to make them more lifelike, but at their very core they are still machines and mechanical in nature. They don't have organic organs, female replicants are not created with a functioning organic uterus nor do male replicants have functioning testicles and this terrible movie never provides any type of rational concept to make such an outlandish idea of artificial lifeforms biologically reproducing even remotely plausible. 

The movie simply states Tyrell Corp mysteriously figured it out and then just moves on expecting you to automatically accept the possibility of the impossible replicant eevolution without plausible evidence so disbelief can never be fully suspended. 

Throw in the pointless red herring surrounding the replicant child which was born instead of being created and compound this with the ham fisted ociopolitical allegory of the second class citizens rising up to fight for their own autonomy in a dystopian society which oppresses their robot kind then you end up with an epic disaster in terms of writing. 

This movie was never going to do well.",1727740855.0
"HerpesQuestions","t5_6kstt7","L-lysine, vitamin C, vitamin D, B vitamins, and iron are commonly discussed in relation to preventing cold sores (HSV-1). Here’s how each may help:

L-lysine: Some studies suggest that L-lysine may help reduce the frequency of cold sore outbreaks by inhibiting the replication of the herpes virus. It’s a popular supplement for those with HSV, though the evidence is mixed. Many people report fewer outbreaks when taking it regularly.

Vitamin C: Known for supporting the immune system, vitamin C may help your body fight off infections, including herpes. While it may not directly prevent cold sores, it could enhance your immune response.

Vitamin D: Adequate vitamin D levels are crucial for a well-functioning immune system. Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to higher susceptibility to infections, so maintaining healthy levels might reduce outbreaks.

B Vitamins: B vitamins, especially B12, play a role in maintaining nerve health and supporting the immune system. While there’s no direct evidence linking B vitamins to cold sore prevention, they contribute to overall well-being, which may help reduce outbreaks.

Iron: Iron deficiency can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to infections. Ensuring that you have enough iron might help your body resist viral infections like HSV-1.


Overall, while there’s no definitive proof that these supplements will prevent cold sores, many people with HSV find that a combination of L-lysine and immune-boosting vitamins helps reduce the frequency of their outbreaks",1727740855.0

"SARMs","t5_4x1zzw","150 - 250mg “lowish”. Your body produces something 50mg of exogenous-equivalent test per week. If you pinned 50mg every 5 days, you’re covered for S23.

I see you’re running S4. Be careful running it with Test at any amount. s4 has an incredibly high affinity to androgen receptors and will easily out-compete Test for binding sites. This will leave you with high levels of unbounded Test which can easily convert to E2 and DHT; Gyno, ask me how I know lol

Why would you wanna run S4 after S23? S23 easily destroys S23 in every respect - better cutter, better vascularity, better muscle retention, better hardener, more aggression, better strength. S4 in my opinion is a gateway SARM if you wanna easily see what you’d look like shredded and vascular if you’re still averse to AAS.

As for your cycle, you’re half-way there. Just add a Test base (Enclo wont cut it) and I wouldnt use S4.

Of course you can do without a Test base. You’ll still get results, although not as good. This assumes that you know how to train and diet.

But if you want bigger, thicker, eye popping buds, you can get there.   Just keep googling, reading and experimenting.  

Keep getting the tools of the trade together, look into the things you can control...  nutrients, soil pH, keep it inscect free,  try training techniques  like mainlining, scrog, or LST.  And if it's an indoor grow you can even control the light levels, daily on/off cycle & lighting quality/color, humidity and temperature.   

Always learn all you can, keep a grow journal, and learn from your mistakes.  it's a journey and a very rewarding hobby.

Last piece of advice is ALWAYS look up the specifics for the Cultivar you are working with.  Good luck & happy growing!",1727740856.0

1) Many women automatically vote republican... (follow their man, their family, etc.) but that voting could have even more real-life consequences. 



Something has the consequences of consequences.

2) Vance is already on record asking Justice Dept to invoke the 1873 law, which could invoke total abortion ban, and could be modernized to include a Hungary-style tracking of women who miss their periods and supposed to check-in with a local agency if they think they're pregnant.



As a consequence of something, consequences happened to someone.

3) In short, women stand to lose their own privacy and simple individual human rights, not to mention the right to abortion. By voting republican, they have a real shot at electing their very own leopards.

I've heard that Abilify helps people in my condition, so I'm a bit curious now.

My friend was just prescribed Lexapro for anxiety but he also suffers from,  as you say, "" feel exhausted all the time / have no motivation to do anything', so now I'm wondering.  His doc wants to add Remeron and I told him to take a chance and try it.  I'll see if I hear any news about that.  I take Wellbutrin and I must say when I need to do stuff, it seems to work.

"legaladvicecanada","t5_3bcod","The answer to your question is at least in part dependant on how long you've worked there.

Given the mass termination they must provide at least 12 weeks of statutory notice (or payment in lieu), this is an independent but likely overlapping entitlement from the common law notice provided in your contract. If you have been there more than 5 years you are almost certainly due statutory severance (also independent but likely overlapping with your contracted notice) which is in addition to the statutory notice and worth 1 week per year of tenure, it cannot be provided as working notice.

Given your contracted notice of 2 weeks per year of tenure, for your to be entitled to more than the statutory notice, statutory severance and the 1 additional week they are offering, you would need to be there more than 14 years.

It is not uncommon for contracted notice periods to be unenforceable, and your may be owed substantially more notice at common law that you are being offered, if your been there fore more than a few years you may wish to get a consultation with an employment lawyer to explore that option.",1727740859.0

DDR3 RAM and 4th/3rd gen intel processor are going to be limited in performance, but considering the rest of the parts added the bundle is a not terrible deal if you don't have other parts.

For perspective on CPU performance, the highest end CPU this motherboard can support (i7-4790K) has 50% of the performance of a low end modern CPU (comparing against the Ryzen 5 4500, which is currently on sale on Amazon for $68 USD). If you're willing to spend more, you can find much better CPU performance for lower power usage (saves on electricity costs in the long run).

If there is any CEO or any person who works in the upper management is reading this.  
Fck your company’s targets. I understand you need to sell your fckng services. 
But stop fcking screaming at employees. They are not selling fish on the fish market. Only people who want things like loans will apply for one.  

And stop asking them to cold call us and beg to take loans. It is very annoying. The only reason I respond calmly is because I know you upper management people are pressuring these poor employees to finish the target.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","I don’t know if this could possibly help your case but I’m a 22 year old who currently deals with an issue similar to your daughters, in my early years I was strictly attracted to the opposite sex, but during my teen years and even to some degree now I faced constant rejection and endless cycles of lust where I would binge watch gay porn. Gay men where in abundance where I lived and it was easier to form a relationship or hookup opportunity with them and I wasn’t having the best luck with women, fortunately I never went through with anything but till this day I still deal with some homosexual desires but I know that isn’t the true me, only a fake manifestation through a screen.

I say all this to say that this could be a phase for your daughter like mines because she’s still young and learning about herself. Or she could actually have an attraction for the same sex, that being said just pray for her and let it work out itself, the truth will come to light.",1727740860.0

"crescentcitysjm","t5_2h70v0","Rhysand: “Rhysand blinked at Randall—and then laughed. A moment later, Cassian and Azriel chuckled as well.”

“I don’t know your daughter, but my companions spent enough time with her lately to give me an idea. She’s softhearted yet ruthless. Scheming yet impulsive. Determined and stubborn. And with a dangerous tendency toward recklessness.”

“She’s been like that since she was a baby,” Ember said, rubbing her temples. “Imagine all that in a one-year-old.”

“Randall cleared his throat in warning, but she could have sworn Rhysand’s mouth twitched upward. Like he could indeed imagine such a thing…”

“Ember glanced over a shoulder, to where Randall stood with Rhysand, Azriel, and Cassian. All the males were now smiling, thank the gods...”

I love that Azriel and Rhysand formed their own relationships with Ember and Randall (Cass too!) — I think Rhys and Bryce could eventually develop a brother/sister relationship.

*”Welcome to the Night Court, Ember. You’ll fit right in here.”*

Now Azriel — “I tried telling Rhysand **and Azriel** how there’s no stopping you when you’ve got your mind set on something, and I think Feyre—Rhysand’s mate—believed me…”

And where is she going now?” Azriel asked with soft, venom. “Now that she has the Mask”—a withering glare at Nesta, whose face was carefully blank—“*where is Bryce going?*”

*That* is a confrontation I’m excited to see.

Bryce at one point (unknowingly) uses Azriel’s own technique to outsmart him — Nesta smirks because she realizes, and Azriel’s siphons, “glimmer at his hands with a cold fury that matched his expression.” But two seconds later, his anger is instead replaced with curiosity, he can’t help but smile at Bryce: “I don’t know whether to be impressed or worried.” I think that will be the overall attitude towards Bryce moving forward—wary, but curious and even impressed.

I think there will be more opportunities to work together and potentially continue those newly formed relationships!

*”Maybe we’ll meet again one day, under less…strange circumstances.”*

honestly it would do some people good to watch lone star again and pay attention to tarlos more.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Our Reddit expert /u/JamesDWho isn’t online right now, so I’ll try to correct you instead. 

> majority of the world has shut their networks down already 

No, they haven’t, and that’s what’s so strange. We’re jumping in very early, while it’s fraught with disaster because these technologies have no universal standard. And Australia is such a small market that the big companies have no incentive to get involved. 

If Australia waits until after the EU etc have gone through this, many of the teething problems will be solved. 

> if people want to have better service around the country we need to move spectrum from the legacy networks over.

This (including its timing) is primarily driven by a profit-for-companies.

This rushed way of doing it, with the government not understanding the technological issues, cause deaths. We need to delay, at least long enough for some obvious issues to be solved. But ideally until after the big markets have gone through this process.

i definitely do not have an easier time with dating apps. i’m not necessarily looking for a relationship (unless the vibe is right), but i do not do hookups at all or have any interest in them.
i find it hard to find men and women and non binary people. likely partially due to the lower amount of non monogamous people where i live.
it also seems that several people assume being non monogamous automatically means i’m down for a hookup with anyone.

the other thing is i can and do get lots of people liking my profile, but largely it’s men way way older than me like uncomfortable level of older as well as couples seeking a unicorn 🫠. i have absolutely zero interest in either of those things and it can make it harder to find people i’m interested in when the majority is those two types of people and they drown out any other potential people. 
i think it can be equally hard for anyone no matter their gender. 
there’s also the fact that there aren’t many dating apps for non monogamous people and lately it seems tons of couples/unicorn hunters have infiltrated feeld. 

there are lots of women interested in casual sex, but i also feel it’s harder for them as well due to similar/same reasons above.

honestly i’d love it if it was easier to find people who have similar wants as me as well as apps exclusively for non mono (monogamous people have also started using feeld which sure they can, but i guess i don’t understand why they wouldn’t use any of the many apps with more mono people on them). it would also be really nice if people would actually read bios before liking someone. i do my very best to be specific in what i’m looking for and that im non mono/poly and i can easily tell when my bio was not read.",1727740862.0

Sure. Gay women do this all the time. 

>Those relationships with other women come with less of a perceived ""burden"" than a relationship with a man does. Most women today see living with a man and sharing a life with a man as a balance between ""what can I tolerate"" and ""how much does he add to my life"". Without that financial support, there is very little to balance out the toleration. And her relationships with other women require a far lesser amount of perceived toleration or burden.

Uh ... what? Living with another human being requires a level of toleration - it doesn't matter if that person is a man or a woman. Financial support is irrelevant 

The rest of your post is ... quite frankly ... nonsense. 

I am perfectly capable of supporting myself financially. I've done it for decades.

A fun beast tamer story that has little to none of my most hated tropes endemic to the genre. 

For details I'll put it in spoilers; >!The pets don't all evolve into mythical creatures - and the cheat isn't based in seeing or designing the evolution line. The cheat isn't a simple talent that makes him incredibly OP in short amount of time, there is a bit more mystery to it.!< 

The pets have personality and the story has some mystery. Overall the story has personality and is definitely top tier in the beast master genre. Its biggest flaw is lacking some depth.

They basically state the US account details are still on hold, but are being given out in waves worldwide.  
So yes, they are available, but it is still taking them time to roll out to everyone.

I don't understand how hypothesising that Ananke could have actually been Elain in disguise (or that she was involved in some way with the ""far larger force"")  takes *anything* away from Gwyn's achievements throughout ACOSF. All it means is that a different person was fuelling her drive to win, and that someone else was watching on when she cut the ribbon. 

It isn't a zero sum game. 

Gwyn's motivation aside, she still helped Nesta and Emerie (and herself, of course!) complete the Blood Rite qualifier and cut the ribbon. Why does it matter if Elain, Nuala and Cerridwen were there, or if Elain - with her possible mystic-type powers - was helping the god/s See what was going on while Nesta and co were doing it? 

It doesn't change anything else. 

It doesn't lessen Gwyn, Nesta or Emerie's accomplishments.

Everything is saturated with it, to the point it masks the taste of everything. Biscuits are blocks of sugar, and when wrapped, like sandwitch bread, it's either hard or stale. Japan's Shokupan in comparison, is a work of art. I'll never forget the shock the first time I planted my teeth in that fluffy bread texture.  
Also, what? Variety? You dare criticizing bread variety while living in Japan??  
Japan where every combini chain offers tons of new types of bread every single week, with seasonal campaigns like 'sweet potato', 'Sicilian lemon', 'FRENCH BUTTER' types etc (I know, I was ordering -*only* a few types of- it when I was working in a 7/11)?  
Even the tiny bakery near my place makes better bread than I've EVER tasted in France. It's ran by two Japanese bakers who learned in France and as soon as they came back to Japan, they started to create varieties of bread I've never heard about, because here, bread is *art.*  
In comparison, in France it's always the same, everywhere. The only 'variety' you get, is the degree of baking of your baguette, lol  
I can't count anymore the number of sweets and bread I've discovered in Japan, all the danish types etc...

But it's the same for all the rest. More variety, food from all over the world or with ingredients advertised as specially from a certain country (the variety of coffee with beans from all over the world illustrates this SO well. Also we never do that in France! We're too proud to praise other countries ingredients), all tastes better because they are careful with the amounts of salt and sugar, and also.... all looks better too. Switch to japanese food and you'll lose weight while constantly discovering new kinds. Hell, that absolutely is what happened the first time I came to Japan. When I came back my mother got that worried look seeing how I had lost weight while being in a host family, and she asked me if I had 'eaten enough'.  
Yes I had! But I had eaten BETTER and HEALTHIER than in France.",1727740863.0

Of those three bases Eielson is the primary operating F-16s in an interceptor role, which is why I went googling as soon as I posted my original comment to confirm which AFB was involved in this specific incident.

As too your original question, since the AFB options are limited, so are the aircraft stationed there and once you factor in the mission profile, interception of enemy aircraft, it further pares down the options to F-16 as most probable (cheapest to operate), followed by F-15 and the F-22 which is least probable (and reserved for only the most serious of incidents; they’re based at Elmendorf-Richardson).",1727740864.0

It doesn't even need to go into the heavy stuff, just things like cosplay/roleplay, public residential areas like the kitchen/living room, etc.",1727740864.0

(Not sure how it is in Captain though because I only just beat the game in officer, but it's a pretty clean run)

my tip is that early game is the hardest and you have to plan carefully, and there's a lot of mechanics that'll help you a lot (using promise and neogtiation to get the research and law you want, it's better than researching it yourself as it'll gain you trust) rush research, emergency council, overclock generator and emergency shift (don't use it too long as people will die)

Try to get frostland team out as fast as possible and get all the stuff out there.

Fortitude base and site of conflict exploration boosts aren't worth it. just get the core from these location

Get the oil from the tanker (where you need moutaineer for it), 50000 oil will help you a lot. get coal from locations from the game

You should research pumpjack and put it on your dreadnought colony before the whiteout, oil input is much better with it.

Outpost 11 will help you a lot with storage.

Ignore food and material in the earlier game, focus on goods first as heatstamp is the biggest roadblock. and until you get the hothouse, frostland team gathering will last you for a long while.",1727740864.0

"ArtistLounge","t5_2yjxy","Why don’t you take some classes at a local art center? If you’re not in a big city, maybe venture out for a weekend class/mentor. There’s also continuing education classes at a lot of institutions. I’ve taken those classes as someone with a BFA they’re equally as great. I think it’s important to get someone’s whose work you’re excited about. There’s fully funded MFAs as well you can research.

To pursuit a career in the arts takes sacrifice. Sometimes needing to have a non art job that keeps you afloat and fund your practice. It usually takes 20 years to get your name out there unless you’re some sort of art star that gets a boost from nepotism. It takes 10 years of a lot of dedication to really develop your work and ideas pounding away time in the studio. 

It’s a really elite world full of kids who already have money. I’m not saying it’s not worth it. It maybe what YOU need to do in life. It takes a toll on everything else though. I know people who’ve wanted it so bad though that they left their two kids and wife to pursuit painting and it was the right decision for him. 

It’s just really hard to make good art juggling other things. Usually if artists have a family, the wife and kids are the support. You’re not supporting them. 

Anyways, as someone who’s been thinking and researching MFA programs for sometime. I still don’t think it’s completely worth it for me even at 32 without external responsibilities. 

I do think a lot of hobbies have more ‘fun’ with their art than a lot of professionals I know do, but at the higher levels, enjoyment is kind of irrelevant.",1727740864.0

"iphonehelp","t5_2sco1","This log shows a kernel panic on an Apple device, which happens when the system encounters a critical error and can’t recover, causing it to restart.

Main Points:

1. The SoC (System on Chip) is the Apple T8110, and the panic happened on October 1, 2024.
2. The error comes from the DART system (used for memory management), where the system tried to write to memory and found an invalid entry.
3. The Darwin kernel version is 23.0.0, compiled on August 24, 2023.
4. Core 0 was the CPU core where the error occurred, and the system couldn’t handle it, causing the crash.
5. Some kernel extensions (like AppleT8110DART) are listed as possible causes, related to managing device memory.

Cause:

This likely happened due to a memory issue —either a bug in the software or a problem with the hardware.

If this happens often, it might be a good idea to update the software or report the problem to Apple.",1727740865.0

Check wherever you see your installed DLC. You’re going to find a small DLC called “Regional Specific DLC”. This is what is only allowing partial nudity in the US.

Uninstall it.

If you’re on a console, change your system’s region to UK. (If PC, I assume you’d through it on PC settings and then run a VPN for UK.

Restart.

Go back into the install and check for updates. A new “Regional DLC” will install, but will have “PEGI 18” written on / next to it.”

Run Conan and full will be restored. 

On console, If you then swap your region back to US, it’ll revert back to partial. 

If it’s on PC, well, I don’t know. But I suspect PC will give you better means to preserve it.

"pmp","t5_2rcb3","I meet 3 types of questions in terms of length:

(1) S-size

Which is a key factor that servant leadership aims to establish in order to improve team performance?

1. A.Trust
2. B.Concentration
3. C.Speed
4. D.Accuracy

(2) M-size

A project management office (PMO) is moving from waterfall to agile project management. The project team has been trained on agile but encounter issues working with company executives using the new processes.

How should project manager address this issue?

1. A.Invite the executives to the project standups so they can learn the importance of the project.
2. B.Meet with the executives to train them on the benefits of agile practices.
3. C.Inform the PMO that the project needs to use waterfall as the project will not succeed without executive acceptance.
4. D.Replace the current project stakeholders with the executives.

(3) L-size

An agile project that the current project manager has been managing for three years is replacing one of the stakeholders with one more familiar with the project’s technology. Additionally, the current project manager is being moved to a more urgent project and is instructed to hand off project management duties to a new project manager. The project is scheduled to run for another three years.

What step should the current project manager take next?

1. A.Recommend that the new stakeholder meet with the product owner to ensure expectations are in alignment.
2. B.Clarify the new stakeholder's expectations for the project and update the engagement plan.
3. C.Meet with the new stakeholder to learn their expectations for this project and update the other stakeholders on these proposed revisions.
4. D.Ensure that the new stakeholder can attend all future sprint meetings and update the project plan with the stakeholder’s proposed revisions.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","One of the cool things about bitcoin is that you can read the block data yourself directly if you don't trust what other people are telling you! Spin up a full node, and you will have all the data that has ever happened on the bitcoin blockchain. It's cool you're digging in because it means you're learning, but this issue was very well documented; the event is [represented ](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2010-5139)as a common vulnerability in the US National Vulnerability Database.

  
I suspect that part of your confusion is coming from confusion around how the blockchain actually works. For instance, you mentioned ""time for the forked version of the chain to catch up..."" There is no catch-up required. Any validator that updates their code starts validating from the genesis block. Post-fork, it simply wouldn't acknowledge transactions beyond block 74637 until a new, compliant block 74638 was mined.

  
Also, bitcoin in 2010 wasn't *AT ALL* what it is now. It's entirely possible that Satoshi mined that new 74638 as a test to make sure that the fix was actually live. Even if it wasn't Satoshi, there is a lot of lost bitcoin from those early days where people cared about the protocol and it's technical success way more than the value of the block subsidy. Hell, [BIP-50](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0050.mediawiki) describes an issue in 2013 that huge pool operators recognized and took action to fix before a bug could be exploited... and that's after the value of a single coin was in **dollars**!

"PoliticalCompassMemes","t5_3ipa1",">It just sucks to feel like everyone is succeeding around you sometimes with minimal effort and you have to bust your ass to even get a single shred of an opportunity. There are lots of people that have life way harder than me, but it does feel like I'm living life on a separate difficulty level and no one seems to care.

On the weekend I was at an old friends' place and we played Monopoly with his school-aged son. His son landed on all the airports first go round the board and bought them up, and it seemed like pretty much every roll of the dice after that he'd either land on the airports (which he owned anyway) or Community Chest (and 3 times out of 4 it would lead to more money coming his way). His dad and I though...several times I passed Go put landed on one of the airports so the $200 didn't come my way at all, and my friend kept landing on his son's airports.

Made me think of how life feels like that sometimes. I'm doing better than I was (financially, mentally, relationship-wise) than I was a few years ago but I know what it's like to feel like every day you're fighting for scraps while other people just do minimal work and have money/ opportunities flowing in. 

I know what it's like to work for a courier-type service, and when you deliver to some house you're greeted by a couple with a bunch of kids in a nice house and contrast it with your own life (entire family live on the other side of the world, come home to a silent house after a long day where your only solace is standing on the front porch toking up listening to music while dinner cooks).

Things have changed for the better in a number of ways. Every life is different. All I could say is that it pays to invest in your relationships - either with friends or even family/ mentors. Find people who are good for you (you'll know how to pick them over time). Going auth-right here but being involved in a church has definitely helped me in this regard as well. The relationships you make/ keep are key and often are what lead to the opportunities you seek.

He would also leave the bar or store without telling us. If we caught up with him and asked him what he was doing, he would say nonsense like, “that place is haunted. I know someone has died there.”

After I quit working, he kept texting me at 5am, asking me how I was, and if I wanted to meet with him.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Really, what were those straight out lies?  About Haitians eating cats and dogs?  Something that they do in Haiti.  There have been people that report that they are, and the mayor says they are not.  Can you prove that not a single cat or dog has been eaten?  So maybe it is true, maybe it is not.     
  
Trump was fact checked on whether he was being sarcastic.  Really?  They can read his mind?  

Trump fact checked about the former governor of Virginia saying a baby could be born alive and them deciding what to do about it?  100% happened.  He talked about how if a baby was born alive during a botched abortion, how they would leave it on the tray and the doctors and woman would discuss whether to give care to it, or just let it die.

Trump fact checked on crime.  He was correct in that the numbers from the FBI are not complete because the last couple of years many of the large departments are not reporting numbers to the FBI.  The DOJ released a report not too long after the debate, that showed that crime in 2023 is about even with 2022, and much higher than it was in 2019.

Harris claimed that Trump left them the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.  A total lie.  it was 6.4%.  In 2009 it was as high as 10%.

Harris claimed that Trump will sign a national abortion ban.  Trump has said in the past he would not, and that he would leave it up to the states.  So a lie by Harris.

Harris claiming that Project 2025 belongs to Trump.  Another lie.

Harris lied about the ""fine people on both sides"".

Harris lied about ""bloodbath"".

Harris lied about the supreme court saying that Trump would essentially be immune from any misconduct while in the White House.

Harris lied about her opposition to fracking, having previously said that there was no question that she is in favor of banning fracking in 2019 when running for president.

Harris said that there no US troops currently in active duty in a combat zone or any war zone.  There are.  She lied.

Harris said that Trump lost manufacturing jobs during his term.  A half truth, half lie.  Trump did create over 400K manufacturing jobs, only to see COVID and the lockdowns erase that number and result in a net loss of 178K manufacturing jobs.

Harris said that Trump had some of the highest trade deficits seen in the history of the country.  Again, that was in 2020 and because of Covid.  She did not mention that 2021, 2022 and 2023 all saw even greater trade deficits.  A half truth/distortion/misleading comment by her.

When only Trump is fact checked, many times for things that very questionable as to whether they are true or not, and Harris is not fact checked for clear lies, it gives people the impression that she is telling the truth and Trump is lying.  It is all part of the narrative of the left that Trump always lies.  They want to make it appear that Trump always lies and the democrats always tell the truth.  If there was any fact checking, that should be done by the candidates that are debating, not the moderators.",1727740867.0

"AsOneAfterInfidelity","t5_fxuis","I basically cornered him into disclosing everything and I am not sure he ever would have told me the full truth otherwise. I am someone that asked every question imaginable because I needed all the details. When something didn’t add up I was patient and circled back to it down the road. He lied his way through MC and maintained that he ‘didn’t remember’ things for the first couple months. Our MC was encouraging of the “I don’t remember” response so that was all just a big cluster. This MC also concluded that WH cheated because he’s *too empathetic* 🙄 I honestly felt like I was sitting there with two idiots, but I digress…

Unlucky for WH, I am really good with details and have a great memory so I’d catch him in little things here and there and he’d get flustered. As soon as he became on edge I basically hammered him with questions trying to trip him up 😅 I’d randomly bring points up and say things like, “so you swear it was just the 3 times?”and he’d say ‘yes, for sure just three.’ Newsflash, prior to me mentioning 3 you have always maintained that it was two. He was terrible at keeping his story straight and I never forgot a thing. 

One day I bluffed and told him I could download his Snapchat data (conversations and pics/video) if he signed a release and he freaked out, which told me there was something to be worried about. I told him the time to be honest was now before I read through it all myself. He spilled his guts. I have learned that he has definite tells when he’s lying and that I have great intuition. He eventually realized that if I kept coming back to a question that I was never going to let it go. That the “I don’t remembers” weren’t going to fly and those things would forever be sticking points for me. I think he just became exhausted by my inquisitions, honestly.

I feel like this worked only because of the types of personalities we each have. Surely there are way better liars out there than my WH. I also work in investigations for a living so I basically just made him my subject and started looking at him through a different lens. Of all the people to cheat on, he should have known better 🤦🏼‍♀️",1727740867.0

A friend who had just seen it told me it wasn’t like that at all. (It was totally like that.) I think she damaged me; I have been so untrusting about movies ever since then.

I lived in Berlin for 3+ years in the 20-teens. We went to all the museums and exhibits about The Wall and The War. While I can’t say I “enjoyed” it, I do think it was good for me, especially as an American born after the Wall went up, to see a little bit of what it was like and the impact it left.

Usually, Goths who were into gothic rock were also into death rock, industrial, art rock, post-punk - along with a myriad of other genres that hold the “goth-adjacent” label. They ARE goth in that way. Much like any other band within the goth space, some songs made by DM do have a gothic sound while others don’t.

Rabbinic Judaism comes from outside of the Levant fully. and I dont have to ascribe to some people's cultural folk beliefs about themselves rebels or not ???!!!!, we can read about the history of the Levant and ancient Levantines

if any anceint Judeans saw modern Judaism and modern jews they would be unrecognizable to them for very good reasons .

there's no one modern Jewish culture . (until Zionism destroyed them) Modern Jews arent the Ancient levantines group of Judeans and Modern Judaism isnt ancient Levantine Judaism(Yahwism then ancient Judaism, closest surviving religon to that is samaratinsim they're indigenous no one argues about them, 

Modern Judaism can be orthodox (400CE) outside the Levant , Karaite Judaism came in 700CE in Iraq/Egypt and reform (20century) all formed outside of the Levant by mostly non Levantines and are different than Biblical ancient Judaism which Samaritanism may resemble it the most today",1727740868.0
"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx",">Which is *directly* arguing for the exclusion of women from gaming simply because of the games that women play.

No. The only thing it argues is that freemium mobile games don't make a person a gamer. I mentioned gender because that was how it was used by people other than me. You are the only one trying to make this a ""men vs women"" thing. This is literally playing the victim.

>You also haven’t given a single decent reason as to why someone who actively plays games isn’t a “gamer.” You’re spouting arbitrary asinine nonsense that doesn’t help gaming, or hobbies in general, as a whole.

both of these are opinion I disagree with.

>So I’ll take a moment to go through some hobbies that give you some sort of title despite not needing to be an expert: playing an instrument (artist/musician) writing (artist/writer) reading (reader) baking (baker) cooking (cook) gaming (gamer) painting (painter)and a whole bunch of other ones. The reason why this is relevant is because with the vast majority of those are dominated by women. There are two exceptions: painting and gaming.

I play the ukulele a bit. It was a fun thing my mom wanted us to do together. I'm not a ""musician"". I have written before, I am not a ""writer"". I can both bake and cook, I and neither a baker nor a cook. I can draw stick figures with a paintbrush, I am not a ""painter"". You are defining these thing so broadly that they become  functionally meaningless terms. If anyone that has ever made themselves food is a cook then what is the point of the term? If anyone capable of putting a paintbrush to paper is a painter then what is the point of the term? At some point, unless you define how much investment and engagement in needed in a hobby to call yourself that thing, everyone is involved with every hobby and any labeling is pointless. If your argument ends with the label being so broad as to be meaningless then you are wrong.

>Gaming is the only hobby that I can think of that is gate kept *this hard* for virtually *no reason*.

That's because men aren't calling themselves a ""cook"" for putting the pizza in the oven or a ""baker"" because they make the dough from scratch. If your argument is that men don't feel the need to break into and force change in women dominated hobbies then OK, I'm on board with that argument.

>That’s ignoring the fact that certain hobbies, like gaming and DND have benefitted massively from becoming more popular and mainstream despite both being known for reviling women players as a whole.

DND? Absolutely, It probably directly benefited form women getting into it. Gaming in general? Arguably not.",1727740868.0

I’ve always been contentious about this, I’ve always perceived it as her just portraying everything around her as if she’s in manga, not actually knowing she is 

And I mean she has the teleportation abilities n other stuff I get that, but has she ever even used them, like I remember people tried to scale her based off the “names” of her skills, like the hyper string theory and other stuff.

But even with that background I think this post is quite unfair to him.

The point of the SPFBO was to both find good books worthy of wider attention that otherwise would be missed while also driving attention to book bloggers to help sustain what had been a big driver of SF/F community in the mid-to-late 00s that was threatened with irrelevance in the 10s. The fact that we have the Books of Babel is, by itself, a monster of an accomplishment.

While, sure, the SFPBO does increase Mark Lawrence's internet cultural footprint in a way that surely sells his books, it was his *existing* popularity that made the concept workable in the first place and drove the traffic that made the thing even happen. ",1727740868.0

The Indigo Elder is a reference to Hemmingway’s ‘The Old Man and The Sea’

Smee seems to be a reference to ‘Peter Pan’ by James Matthew Barrie

Dongbaek is referencing author Gim Yujeong and his short story ‘The Camellias’

"AdditiveManufacturing","t5_31ziw","I totally agree; that’s where we started. Our current setup is a custom holder with very smooth bearings - tension was actually too low, so we added some adjustable felt pads for a bit of friction. 

There are two issues at play here: one, we want to switch to an inline filament dryer, which adds significant drag to the filament regardless of the spool mount. 

Two, we don’t have a reverse Bowden running to the extruder, and with the BigRep travel moves can be 4ft or more - so it can yank a ton of filament at once, then nothing. 

Obviously the low hanging fruit is installing a reverse Bowden. We have avoided that in the past out of fear that it will sag into the build volume. Most of the desktop solutions for that don’t apply here, but the retractable lanyard idea seems viable. So I’m going to attempt a wide spiral suspended above the gantry. 

I suspect that will make a big difference on smoothing the motion, but if anything would only increase the drag (minimally against PTFE, but still).",1727740869.0

Even if the democrats win right now, which they probably will, then what? How are they being held accountable? What's stopping the next right-wing fascist looney from gaining power? How many times have we had a democratic president fail to deliver on their promises, if not hurt people worse? These should not be our only options. People deserve better and we can create better. Like I said, vote however you want, but people are completely valid for being disillusioned by the failures of the democratic party and it's not disingenuous  to demand better.",1727740869.0

In Australia our building codes require that houses in cyclone-prone areas (& that includes areas well south of any cyclone activity) have additional structural support and I think that roofs have to withstand better than 160kph/100mph winds. In the real cyclone areas (North Queensland) I can’t remember seeing anything but metal and the code there is very tough. It adds significantly to building costs.

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","I absolutely do this while listening - I use Mobile Word's Read Aloud function which works pretty darn well, and I sometimes use quite a bit of onomatopoeia or hyphenated words or made up words.  It does the trick pretty well!  I do sometimes layer in Spanish phrasing amidst English, and I REALLY wish that function could switch more seamlessly between the English and Spanish language narrators.

I like hearing my work read back to me mostly for critical reasons - I want my writing to control the way the sounds are playing out in my reader's mind-voice.  When the sentence is said out loud, I can more objectively pick out wonkily structured sentences (either run on, too short, or odd word choice), I can pick out duplicate words in close proximity, and as I like to think of writing as making a musical piece I can ""hear"" if my sections are too short, too long, etc.

"silenthill","t5_2rrim","See that's part of the problem. Gaming as of today would offer so much variety by having legitimate access to both modern and classic releases.

But there is a lack of backwards compatibility and decent remasters/ports that pushes to mostly modern releases. Then we get remakes like these that completely seek to replace the original.

I just don't see why we can't have both. 

To put it more simply, imagine you could not watch any of the original animated Disney classics (unless resorting to outdated hardware and piracy) in a legitimate way and they'd only offer the live action remakes from now on.",1727740871.0

"relationships_advice","t5_2rnv7","This is a very difficult time. I'm sorry that you're going through this and I'm even more sorry to say that this outcome was inevitable.

I know that my opinions are controversial in certain circles. Keeping a relationship going for 8.5 years is difficult. Keeping a teenage relationship going that long is very nearly impossible. 

Both of you have grown and changed a lot in that time frame. The things that a seventeen year old is looking for from a relationship are very different from what a person of 25 or 26 wants from a relationship. People grow faster in that age range than relationships do. The patterns of your relationship were still stuck in the past and no longer worked today. 

You weren't treating each other very well. Your resentments had compounded over the years while your inclination towards kindness and patience had not.

You both made huge sacrifices along the way and probably took your relationship too seriously too early. I don't mean loving each other and being faithful is a bad thing but playing at being in an adult relationship when you aren't cooked through all the way rarely works. Sometimes the most mature thing a person can do is recognize your own immaturity. That's all in the past.

Moving forward, you're going to eventually start an adult relationship from scratch with another adult. That is going to be a far easier path than trying to deconstruct a teenage romance and rebuild it to work in your full fledged adulthood.  I'm sure that you've lost part of yourself along the way and maybe didn't discover other things. This will be an opportunity to change all of that",1727740871.0

"TheForeverWinter","t5_aukwsb","Hello fellow D2 player who left because of the seasons! There are dozens of us! (Actually, there are probably thousands...)

The one with Rasputin was actually the last one I played. I didn't have much time to play that season (moved apartments twice, left my job to go back to school, etc) and barely got into it. When I started to have (slightly) more free time again the season was basically over, and I decided that I was over Destiny. Objectively I could have just played the next season and kept up with max light, but missing most of the least season just felt so bad I didn't want to bother.

The water mechanic actually seems a lot less bad than that imo: there's nothing that you're missing out on forever. I know it'll make me *feel* similarly, though, and that's why I'm not picking the game up yet. Just following along with the news and waiting to see what direction things move in.

Also re: seasonal stuff, this isn't really related to Forever Winter, but I really like what Deep Rock Galactic has done with their seasonal system. You can go back at any time and unlock stuff from previous seasons! Really good shit. It keeps the game fresh with new biomes/mechanics/etc, and avoids all the fomo",1727740871.0

I was honestly shocked that she would ask me to do that on her birthday or that she would think I would be upset about that.

By the time all was said and done, she didn’t even make it past 9pm before she passed out drunk. We all ended up continuing to party without her till about 1am.

"TheWalkingDeadGame","t5_2tzww","I did my own theory awhile ago of what if Larry survived made him be semi nicer to Lee but more in kin to we stay out of each other's way as for the secret when Carley tells him he should start to tell people if the player talks to larry larry will warn lee that it probably wont go overwell in his own way of course ""go ahead but don't blame me if the group decides to toss you out on your ass"" I ended up killing katja and duck in a much worse way since lilly would be focusing on her dad more then everyone else katja is shot in the head and falls on duck leading to duck getting eaten by a walker how the Rv scene goes down is pretty different for obvious reasons 

Kenny wants nothing to do with the argument after the loss of his family and just wants to be alone 

Ben doesn't speak up to defend anyone like in cannon 

Larry+lilly are both on board with kicking Carley/Doug out of the group(this leads to whomever joining the season 3 cast) 

Lee however is outnumbered in terms of voting power so regardless of the players choices Carley/ Doug is now gone kicked out of the group 

This is just a portion of what changed in the story another big change was Omid and Christa not being present leading to Ben being the one to fall off the train you can either save him or ignore him if you ignore him chuck will save him and not be your biggest fan 

Episode 4 Larry takes a backseat for this one as he gets a heart attack Vernon tells him that both Ben and Larry will die without proper medicine and such Kenny gets drunk and claims ""who gives a shit the old fuck gonna die anyway"" this leads to lilly punching Kenny who just kinda shakes his head with a confused look on his face 

The ending of the series is probably the biggest change so I really wanted Larry to stick around so I have him the power of plot armor he lives up til the end of season 2 

The group clementine finds at the end of the game includes Vernon lilly and Larry a very different squad then what we see normally 

Vernon ends up snitching on the group causing the bandit attack lilly tells both her father and Clem to run while she holds them off leading to lilly getting separated from the group Larry and Clem get separated but because of the power of plot armor I gave Larry the ability to track where she would end up basically 

This leads to a larry and Clem vibe which sounds disastrous but Larry has had time to reflect on his life and wants to raise Clem better than he raised lilly there's plenty more but I'm calling it here for now",1727740872.0

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:


* **0** Learn kana (hiragana and katakana) before anything else.


* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Yasashii Kotoba News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on ChatGPT, DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

Like I said, Mitch Garver is his most prominent offensive signing, and the most amount of money Jerry has given to a FA bat.

The reality is, he isn’t good at *bargain hunting,* because that is what he has been forced to do. You said the data is there, and it is.

Trump is running on the economy, and telling his supporters that he will fix their economic issues. He at least partly believes there are people that are in a real economic hardship. So he understands people are struggling.


And then he turns around and engages in this level of grift, that is specifically designed to con people out of money. He isn't just playing to their fears and hardships for political gain; he is leveraging their trust to extract money out of them. These are the people he knows are struggling.


This is a supposed business genius, a billionaire. He doesn't require this type of scheme. And yet here he is, milking everything he can from people that have given him so much undeserved trust.

"medical","t5_2r1b9","It does not cause meningitis. 

It is predominantly a urological infection that may or may not cause problems. Symptoms are important in the evaluation of any finding, especially with PCR testing. A positive PCR can detect it but that doesn't mean there is an infection present as it can be transient or simply commensal and not cause infection. That's where symptoms come in and detect infection rather than just colonization. 

It can cause non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) which means there can be urethral irritation. Such an infection can also progress and cause extended problems similar to chlamydia. In those situations, such infections should be treated as your doctor suggested. 

Like with any bacteria, resistance can be a regional problem, and depending on your country and region there is an accepted antibiotic of choice. If it doesn't work then another can be tried. 

Your boyfriend can try and get some money or try a community clinic or a public health clinic for treatment. There are no home treatments or foods. It can be sexually transmitted and so if you have it you can give it to him and then if you get treated without him getting treated then you will get it back. It will just be a back and forth type of thing if both of you don't get treated together. 

In females it can cause gynecological problems including PID and its associated complications as infections can cause damage to tubes etc. 

Clinical correlation is needed for both female and males when testing comes up positive. There is a significant positivity rate in asymptomatic individuals.",1727740873.0

"woahthatsinteresting","t5_bo2fq6","I think the calculus is just to put warm bodies there who would be in the way of an armed robber. They don't actually need a couple Navy SEAL badasses to do it. 

The idea is that even if it's a couple of armed dunces, a robber would have to murder them and all the sudden the snatch of a bag of money is now a double homicide that's going to put you on death row. The goal of the guards is just to weed out potential robbers who aren't willing to murder someone (which probably cuts out about 99% of potential armored car robbers).

It's semi-related to why militaries used manned aircraft frequently even when remote-piloted or AI aircraft could do the job. If an adversary shoots down your $100m fighter jet and kills the pilot, that's probably going to start a war. If they shoot down your $100m drone you'd probably issue a sternly-worded letter. Both sides know this, so they're far less likely to just dick around and shoot down a manned aircraft.",1727740874.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","I didn't respond because you're clearly a brain washed misogynist incapable of critical though. Also why you state that the murder of pregnant person (btw homicide is a leading cause of death for them) *can* be charged as double homicide it is not *automatically* treated as such. Hmm wonder why that is? 🤔 Also punching a person is assault you ignoramus (see that lack of critical thinking really shining though) so the fetus is once again irrelevant - except in the fact that in puts a pregnant persons life in danger. Everything in this world has some inherent risk but abortions aren't ""dangerous"" and childbirth/pregnancy is a much greater threat to a person's life and health, but you're clearly too red pilled to believe that. Also fetal pain is irrelevant. The cows and pigs we slaughter for our convenience feel pain but they are a lesser life form so we don't care. And they are faaaar more sentient and developed than a fetus.

They are a group organized and designed to win political power in whatever system the polity has. This could be the Bolsheviks by a coup in 1917, the Whigs by Hannoverian favour, or many more. It doesn't decide whether they are a political party. It does decide whether and how you should support them though, along with whether you agree with their platform and believe their candidates for power are people who should have it. 

What the Republican Party has become is one wholly unsuited for being a party valuing a democratic secular republic in a system governed by the rule of law and equality for the people. That is a different question.",1727740876.0

"Marriage","t5_2reak","If a woman doesn't feel comfortable and safe emotionally in the relationship then she won't feel safe to have sex with you. I don't mean this as you're hurting her, I just mean it as she doesn't feel like the relationship is strong right now so sex is the last thing in her mind. When a woman feels like things aren't going well and you might leave, then why would she have sex with you? Even if she's on birth control, that is still how she can get pregnant. It's a very primal thing. If the man isn't stable in her eyes to be there for her, then he won't be there for any kids. Thus sex is the last thing she wants. She may not even see it as that. However a lot of our urges and desires come from a primal place that we don't even realize. Until she feels safe that you are staying together, then she probably won't have sex with you. I think that's pretty fair to be honest. I wouldn't sleep with someone who might be leaving me tomorrow. That's ridiculous. Even if that's not the case, she doesn't know for certain. Also it's very hormone driven. Just asking for sex is doesn't make women in the mood. We need words, and touching, and so much more. If you really want sex, you need to make her want it. Figure that out. But your ""want to have sex"" question is the biggest turn off when women are mad. I'd be like ew... go away lol so you got the same response.",1727740876.0
"AskVet","t5_2sx1m","Just wanted to add for all the people stating the vet should have done a x-ray or ultrasound. The vet can't do this without consent. I am a vet and unfortunately if the owner doesn't want to do additional diagnostics, either because they can't afford it or they just don't want it done there is absolutely nothing I can do about it. It gets very disheartening to see people immediately bad mouth the vet for things they should have done when in reality these would have been discussed with the owner but ultimately it's the owner's choice on what happens to their pet and then, due to confidentiality, when that owner starts blaming the vet for the poor outcome of the pet's condition on social media, we are unable to defend ourselves. 
Yes there are some vets who give the profession a bad name but I bet, 90% of the time it's owners who have chosen to disregard our advice and then go on social media to look for other options whilst blaming us for the situation they are in.  

OP often when a queen only had one kitten in a litter that kitten can get a bit oversized so this would explain why they got stuck. It would be advisable to have her imaged to ascertain if there are any other kittens but if she is showing no signs of labour, is eating and drinking well, has no vaginal discharge and is otherwise well then I wouldn't class this as an emergency but I would want her checked within the next 24hrs. Please do not give her milk as this will make her unwell. She needs to be fed a good quality kitten food and fresh clean water only.",1727740876.0

"CompanyOfHeroes","t5_2rn3p","I found that CoH2 had better faction variety and balance so put down CoH3 pretty quickly, and still play CoH2. 


The things that jump out at me are that CoH3 feels more arcade-y, probably due to the long TTK, quick VP drain and lack of an epic soundtrack.


There's also a lack of interest in detail in CoH3 - 76mm shermans are just the new turret but keep the shorter 75mm hull, so look a little off. Easy 8s aren't actually the easy 8 model. They had all of these in CoH2, so it's not clear why they didn't care enough to properly implement them in CoH3.",1727740877.0

I didn't mean to dog on Japanese custom makers, but I thought they were meaning that this was a production knife that probably was done quickly and on the cheap.   San mai for under 200 seems like it would be very affordable for a custom made.",1727740877.0

Or if you are confident and want them cheaper buy broken/faulty  controllers and fix them.

"7vsWild","t5_5bom3i",">Was sind eure Eindrücke von Folge 1?

Habs nicht gecheckt, warum sie nicht erstmal die Gegend abgecheckt haben, sondern direkt das Lager am Flugzeug aufgeschlagen haben. Hat man doch in den anderen Staffeln nur gesehen, dass die Teilnehmer sich erstmal umgeguckt haben. Und Fritz erklärt denen ja auch am Absturzort, dass die überall hinkönnen. Stefan geht dann Scouten, ohne das vorher mit irgendwem abzusprechen, und als er ne halbe Stunde später wiederkommt sind alle anderen schon mit dem Lagerbau zugange. 

Ich weiß nicht, ob ichs mit einbilde, aber ich meine da direkt Spannung zwischen Stefan und Joe zu spüren. Eigentlich sollten sich die Profis doch absprechen und koordiniert vorgehen. Für mich sah das in Folge eins schon so aus, als würden die sich aktiv aus dem Weg gehen.

Und Joey schon wieder am Kloppen. Der Mann ist ein Phänomen.

They flag some teeth for potential removal, but don’t know for sure what’s needed until they can do a full exam under sedation. I bring all this up because they told us to watch for balling hay/grass after he had some incisors removed.

After that appointment say that you're sorry, but per your doctor's recommendation, you're not able to donate due to your own poor health.

Of course depending on how likely your parents are to believe you, going in to get tested and telling the doctor that you're being coerced into donating against your will and that you're not in good health either will absolutely shut that down too, and there will be an actual doctor telling them that you're not healthy enough to donate, match or no.",1727740879.0

* Arab Slave Trade (only ended in 1962)
* Ottoman Slave Trade
* Spartan Slavery
* Riffian-Barbary Slaves
* French Slave Trade in Saint Domingue/Haiti
* Tibetan Slavery before 1950 Mao Zedong's intervention
* Spanish Mit'a and Encomienda in the colonies of New Spain, Peru, Captaincy of Chile and Royal Audience of Charcas
* Egyptian solder slaves for males, and life long sex slaves for women.
* Brazilian Slave trade (ended in 1872)

All of these were worse than the north american slavery system. All of them were bad, including the Americas, but all of these were even worse.

The Haitian slave trade literally worked on the premise that slaves were cheaper to replace than to keep alive. So they worked their slaves to death one after another and just replaced them. They alone accounted for 1/3rd of the entire Atlantic slave trade.

Remember how I said Haiti was responsible for a 1/3rd? Brazil was half. Brazil did far worse to slaves than what American slave owners did, and they were also the last country in the America's to get rid of it. They enslaved African's, their own people and anyone else they could find that couldn't fight back.

If you think North American Slavery was the worst in the world, it's only because you are completely uneducated on the topic. It was of course terrible. All slavery is. It wasn't nearly the worst conditions in slavery though.",1727740879.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","You, your wife, and that TikTok idiot are all AH.

The TikTok chick for being so entitled and trying to tell others that kind of thinking is okay. It is plane nuts

Your wife because she is letting her hormones think for her. What she is asking is way out of line except maybe that tattoo. Given what pregnancy, labor and delivery does to most women's bodies, that seems very fair, especially since a lot of guys complain about all the weight their wives gain while nursing.

You because of your attitudes. It could have been handled so much better. If you spoke to her the way you wrote this, you were talking down to her. Yes the present of a child is a wonderful gift, and I may be pegging you all wrong. You may be the husband who does housework without asking and will help with the baby after he/she is born. What your wife is getting is the better part of a year of no sleep, sore breasts, and if she works another whole job on top of it. Just the act of getting pregnant and giving birth can put her life and reproductive organs in danger depending on what state you life in.

"AskHistory","t5_2sa8i","I think a lot of people also are not accounting for the changes in warfare a new world war would bring. Specifically cyber warfare. Nearly every American has had the SSN leaked. China has been stealing IP and hacking our networks for a long time, they are the most likely ones responsible for the power plant hacks in the last few years.

Everyone saying we are not close to world war 3 right now is not paying attention. Russia has literally been counter invaded. China is distancing themselves from them but it could very well be a ruse as they also seriously want Taiwan. The limited nature of war between nuclear powers could very well mean the following scenario plays out.

After some escalation in the Russia / Ukraine conflict forces the US to be focused elsewhere, China invaded Taiwan. The US responds with threats of force and aid to Taiwan but no direct intervention. Millions of US citizens suddenly have their credit destroyed, credit cards hacked etc. power plants start going down with rolling blackouts and a new financial crisis begins. This would probably lead to war and it Is unlikely, but China very well may be suited to surviving a financial crisis by stockpiling food and oil and all the things we do not have stockpiled.

The average Chinese citizen makes 14,000 a year, their society would likely have far less war fatigue than Americans and would be more able to survive another financial crisis. 

Its is very arrogant to think any challenge would come directly against our military and not through subversive means. The Chinese are not stupid, yet our government seems to be quite dysfunctional atm, our politicians are also not driven by patriotism but greed. Even a limited attack on finical markets would likely make them reconsider war with China over Taiwan. 

The US and Chinese economies are so linked a conflict would be disastrous for the global economy, so for that reason it is unlikely. But increasing tensions leading to a limited cyber war and proxy conflict is something I can definitely see happening in the next 10 years.

Girl you just gotta know when someone just wants to chill with you like a homie and not make shit weird and set boundaries if you think it's going that way. Men are people, women are people and I'm so tired of people separating this when it comes to *any* relationships. Interests overlap and gender never has to be in the way unless you're just so coomer-brained you can't share interests with a lady/dude without the expectation of sex. In fact, my best friend became one of my husband's best friends and it's 100% chill because he's a kind functional man and not a monkey-brained idiot thinking with his dick all the time lmao. He also has said he tends to become easier friends with women, and we met in a study group where we all became friends and he was the only guy (it just so happened to be mutual pursuit at a point for us two but never hit on anyone openly). Sorry if you haven't found someone you can trust like that but not all dudes are scumbags and can be cool with women friends. Likewise, I'm friends with all his guy friends as well.

Why am I around the guys so much if I don't think they're hot? They play the same games as me and are some of the funniest dudes. Why is he hanging out with my best friend if it doesn't lead somewhere? Because they have similar traveling interests and are both history nerds. Neither of us has ever had the thought to cheat and are very happy together (and both mutually give each other open access to all our stuff if you're doubting). Again, people have things in common other than attraction, and you can be friends with someone without thinking they're attractive, in any sexuality actually (and trust me the dude friends have ripped on me and I've ripped on them lmao there's *no* attraction there).",1727740880.0

"texts","t5_2sbrh","No one really know the back story. And don’t say it shouldn’t matter because it absolutely matters. That’s who more today than ever the play is no longer a joke. U just can’t have kids anymore with a I hope it works out. This is fact a give the option to save either his wife or his child, can only save one and 9/10 times he saves the wife. Give the wife the options and 9/10 she saves the child. Ironically the man never gets saved, that’s why when you see a man out there and he is self-sufficient self-reliant to scare his own shit doesn’t need anybody and did it all on his own with nothing. The man was able to save himself most men these days can’t even save themselves, point is I’m sure this guy loves his daughter but the thing that’s getting in his way between his love for his daughter and his daughter is the mother. I’m not anyone’s fault I’m saying this is the reality of things who knows what happened between them but whatever happened is affecting him and his daughters relationship because his relationship with his wife, which is undoubtedly more important I know that’s hard to believe from a woman, but it is more important than his relationship with his child. If you think about that for a second it’s pretty obvious why when something doesn’t work out they automatically label is deadbeats, more than half the time it’s not deadbeats more than half the time it’s psychology and the fact that can’t seem to put aside whatever was there with the relationship to only focus on the child it’s very difficult for a guy to do because guys just have not evolved that way. Same way woman could not find herself saving the husband and letting the child die a man will do that every time without hesitation, a man will not even look at the baby in a womb that is 89 months old and it’s supposed to be coming out that day, but can’t because there’s complications and in order for the mother to live they have to kill the fetus because now that baby is  use no longer a baby it is a fetus. It is a thing because the wife needs to live. It’s just how  men think . it has to be that way from a survival point. Ancient times  if everyone only looked after the   Child, share the child might have a larger chance of survival only if the mother stays alive, but if everyone’s always focused on a child, and something happens to the mother and the mother dies, most likely, the child will die not so long after because men came and were not taking care of children, they weren’t there they were spending days and weeks and even months at a time hunting the child would be left to wonder",1727740881.0

"newworldgame","t5_3gmxe","You do have a point and I'm not gonna try to talk you out of it, but I'd like you (and potentially other console players reading this post) to consider couple points so that you could make a well-informed decision. Beware, wall of text incoming.

1. For the server to be healthy it desperately needs population. Economy, atmosphere, almost every activity requires as much people on the server as possible. The more the merrier. I've seen what happens to dying servers, and considering AGS unwillingness to merge them in time or allowing transfers - servers will be going down like flies. ""But they must have learned on their mistakes, they will do better this time"" - nope, nay, not happening, been there already.
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I know console servers will be restricted by platforms: xbox playing with xbox, ps with ps, etc. IMO such server will be dead soooo much faster than crossplay ones.

2. About scary pc veterans wanting to gnaw on the bones of poor new console players. I've got 4.5k hours in this game (mostly in pvp, but a chunk of pve as well), I've seen early game, endgame, gameplay loops etc, etc. And I've also seen new players leveling and getting to the level of vets in a span of a 100 hours. Some bit faster, some bit slower, but seen that many times. If you played any MMO, you would agree, that 100h for an MMO is nothing.

The thing is - the game is simple af. For the best or for the worst. You've got 2 weapons, 3 buttons, heartrune, dodge button. Most of the weapons have their own save and escape mechanics, frequent heal potions can make up for your occasional mistakes, some perks drop CCs. We don't even have stun in this game - it's more like a sleep mechanic, which is removed upon receiving damage. Positioning matters, but not as much - even being caught off position doesn't guarantee your immediate death. TTK is huge as well.
There are no complicated movement mechanics which give you advantage (like bhops in cs or super gliding in apex). The closest and the only one is probably the ""dolphin dive"" which is more about how cool it looks rather then actual usefulness. Google it if interested.Not sure if it even works in NWA now.

What I'm saying is - players getting experience in this game hit plato quite early. Considering amount of text and video guides, people willing to teach newbies - trust me, you will hit that plato very early, reaching the level of players who put hundreds and thousand hours in this game.

Now the question is - are you willing to risk ending up on a dead server in a month just for not wanting to play with PC players, even though you could catch up to them pretty fast? That's only for you to decide.",1727740881.0

You are partially right, because in some way we are literally animals, as we have primal, animalistic instincts, especially males, but in another way, we are far away from being one.

Please expand on the independent contractor thing, and outside work allowed at your uni.

1.  Does this mean you get no pension?    
2.  Your school is ok with outside work, apparently.  Our school won’t raise our wages (hasn’t for years) and I was wondering what they would be allowed to approve in terms of side jobs for teachers, and where, if I asked them to allow us the freedom to supplement our income more.  I had always heard the MOE would block certain outside work, such as hagwons.  But maybe not public schools?  How  about PT company gigs? Is this why you work as a contractor, so that you can still do these types of jobs?

It looks like our school’s English department is hanging on by a thread at times and will never raise our pay.  We will be lucky to hang on and keep hiring those we lose to attrition.  Still our foreign staff is finding it difficult to live in Seoul on the salary we are paid.  I am searching for ways we might get alternative work approved.",1727740883.0

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","Workmate of mine showed me his balance. Racked up 1.4mil qff points through credit cards. 

Says it pays for a free trip every year for his family of 5. Think he went to New Zealand snowboarding last year. 

He said the main thing to be careful of is the annual fees, spending habits, borrowing power, and t&c.

First is the annual fee. Whilst a cc that offers good amount of points can be considered appealing, he mentioned that you need to check the cards t&c. Some of them have a 12-18month hold requirement. This doesn't seem like an issue, but if you couple the two yearly fees together, you could out to be in the negative. 

Second is the spending habits.He mentions when he had more than 2 he would need to up his game to monitor all spends. If you are good and disciplined, then cc like this will work for you. I am hesitant cause I'm not sure if I resist spending.

Third is borrowing power. Holding just one or even more can severely degrade your borrowing capacity. I would say know what your purchasing horizons are before considering one. 

Fourth is the t&c. On top of holding requirements, some cards also have different payment durations, etc. like the Westpac one which comes with a 45 day term. Whilst it might considered appealing to wait 45 days to then pay the balance, I would say have a goal to stick to payment frequency. Like just pay the balance every month regardless of the no interest of 45 day term. 

In the long run I like to get into cc more and utilize them to my benefit. Would be nice to have a free trip every year overseas.",1727740883.0

""surgery will either fail to heal initially or fail to hold up. I have talked to many others told the same. I've also heard from many who have had multiple ortho surgeries so I think it is based on degree of ""effectedness"" of skin/joints/soft tissues. Other things complicate surgery such as heart issues. I did have a repair of a facial artery (no other choice), vascular and plastic surgeon got it fixed.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","I agree. What sets DA2 apart from the other games in the series is that it handles a lot more 'personal' horror than either of the others. Everything that happens in DA2 directly impacts Hawke or someone they are very close to, and Hawke is rarely if ever actually able to stop the bad things from happening.

DAO does have personal horror, but its front-loaded before you have a chance to connect to your PC. The rest of the game's unstoppable horror happens to other characters. And much of it can be outright avoided if you play your cards right (bringing mages to help Connor, not Annuling the Circle, brokering peace with the werewolves etc.) DAI completely glosses over personal horror for the sake of its narrative about erasure of identity, and the world horror is weakened by the sheer volume of the game which overstimulates our ability to empathise.

Hawke has absolutely no recourse at any time, and as the player even if you see the moment coming there is nothing you can do to stop it. We're forced into the role of the victim cowering behind the shower curtain in the horror movie, waiting for the knife to descend. And it always does.",1727740884.0

>They had top Russian tanks

Lmfao 90% of their tanks were T-54s, T-55s and T-62s with remaining 10% being T-72Ms which were exported downgraded T-72As. They had a mechanical ballistic computer, basic Infrared illumination and steel sabots with downgraded 1st Generation Composite Armour 

The top Russian tanks in 1991 was the T-80U with 3rd Gen night vision, digital FCS, 2nd Gen Composite Armour and 2nd Gen ERA

Fucks sake even the soviet reserve tanks like T-72BV, T-62MV and T-55M were better than anything Iraq had 

Iraqs military was across the board obsolete 

Iraq didn't even have CLOSE to the best soviet weaponry lmao their most advanced soviet tank was a T-72, not the 1st gen model, the downgraded inter gen T-72M1. Their most advanced tanks was the 30+ Chieftain MK5s they stole from iran. The USSR premier tanks at that point were 3rd generation T-80U with average being 3rd Generation T-64BV and T-80BV with reserves made up of 2nd Gen T-62MV,  T-55MV, T-72A, T-72BV with a bulk of storage made up of 1st Gen T-62AD, T-55A and T-64A. 

Iraq's most ADVANCED air defence systems were 2nd Gen SAM systems like Osa and Kub. At a time when 3rd Gen systems like S-300, Tor and Buk had been out for 10-20 years and there most advanced ATGMs (in very small numbers) were production 9P135 Fagot Launchers with 9M111 guided Missle from early 70s at a time when 9P135M2 launcher and 9M111-2  was frontline in soviet army lol as for Iraq there frontline ATGM was the MCLOS Malyutka, we shouldn't need to tell you how ridiculous that is if you understand military matters and I only send these essays to people who are talking about such things. As for IFVs, Iraq only had 1st gen BMP-1 with some tiny amounts of downgraded BMP-2s, whilst Russia had 2nd gen BMP-2 and 2nd Gen BMD-2s all in large numbers and had 3rd gen BMP-3 for 3 years, and as for aircraft, even worse, Iraq's ONLY semi modern soviet aircraft, was the 37, 30 and ~20  export downgraded 3.5 Gen MiG-29A-12B, Su-24MK and MiG-23ML-E they had, when at this point Soviets had just fielded there first 4+ gen Su-27M and Su-30.

>Iran lost most of its navy just for firing at US ships

Most of its navy 🤣🤣🤣 if you are talking about praying mantis they lost a frigates and few speedboats lmao 🤣 

>China only has draws

That's just fucking lies. They beat India in the sino Indian war and the fact they forced the US into a draw after humiliating them into their longest retreat in their Military history speaks volumes 

The US has NO modern victories 

>500 marines taking out 2000 Russian mercs in syria is far more impressive.

Absolute retard argument. Bragging about beating mercs who were using Syrian hand me downs whilst you have a proper military and air force is absolutely laughable. Although I don't blame you since the US has so little to actually brag about

Fast forwarding or rewinding to find the song I wanted to hear, or even better, getting blank cassettes and hitting record while the radio is playing to record the song straight to tape, to make my perfect mix tape of favorite tunes and then playing them on the Walkman on the school bus.

Then CDs started happening. Like, really fast. Suddenly everything was on CD and we all needed a CD player in the house and new cars started getting cd players. Around this time I got a Sony Discman - a portable single cd player with a headphones, just like a Walkman. It was siiiick, the sound quality was infinitely better than the Walkman I’d been using. 

I still have a CD binder thing, it’s got all the album inserts from CDs with each Cd tucked behind. It was really unsafe but super common to be flipping through pages of CDs deciding what to play on the road if driving 😬 

CDs would get scratches. You’d know, once you got to that last chorus of “Maui Wowie,” every time it would go, “that Mau-mau-maui-i wow-ow-ow-ow-owieeeee” and have to just be prepared for that skip to happen. 

Sometimes if you rub toothpaste into a scratch it helps fix it.

There's loads of free material all across YouTube and guitar instruction sites for you to reference. I'd say most people here either have first hand experience with or would at least first recommend Justin Guitar (Justin has both a website and YouTube page, whichever you'd like to visit). 
  
I normally just recommend that folks take the first year to introduce themselves to basic chord shapes (A-G major) and to get their general knowledge of the instrument up. You'll want to make sure you don't overload yourself, as there's nearly an infinite amount of things to learn about this hobby depending on who you ask.  
  
You can start with what are called ""open"" chords right now - those are the first ones that practically every new guitarist learns. This will start to teach you the foundation of how the notes on the fretboard work as well. As you get comfortable with developing your memorization muscles and your hands don't need to ""think"" as much in order to fret these chords, you can start getting better at switching between any of them.  
  
After that, it's really your own journey to shape. I'm happy to help any time, message whenever you'd like.",1727740887.0

Ok. let me make a better response here. It will run a very limited version of linux (see below) butit's a very, very low powered processor. It includes boath a pair of ARM Cortex M33 cores and a pair of RISC-V cores at ~150mhz. 

Running linux, then an arcade emulator, then and arcade game is a LOT of layers for something that slow. It's also not a design goal of the chip, so there probably won't be. read up on the dc32 badge build process and the architecture for that. They used what's basically a custom GBA emulator designed for the chip.

"Rainbow6","t5_2t1bl","Yeah this is exactly why the ranked system is garbage. It only counts wins/losses to rank you when it should rank you based on KOST or EPS like they do with pros. Even your entry kills and KD matters in pro league but all the sudden in ranked it’s all about how the team performs? So when you solo queue the system tries to put together two teams of similar averaged MMR already predetermined by win/losses only.      
      
When I started playing this game it was in year 2 and I was lucky to find a 4 stack of friends who all lived in the same area as me. We became a 5 stack and our discord members just grew so we always had a stack, sometimes with people waiting to join. I remember nights where we had enough people for 2 stacks. Those were the days. We weren’t the best players in the world but one friend and I played exactly the same amount of games one season and both had the exact same MMR, 50 points shy of diamond. He and I were completely different players. That’s when I realized how broken the system is. This was way before even champ rank was introduced. Then they did a reset during operation health iirc.     
I stopped playing a few years ago. My stack and I were stuck in plat by then. Later I saw my unranked MMR was much higher than my ranked MMR. I was diamond when I solo queued unranked to warm up while my stack showed up. I realized with my stack we’d always be stuck in plat. If I wanted diamond in ranked I would have had to ditch my friends and play with diamond MMR players in ranked instead.    
My friends don’t play either today. If I played siege today, I’d be solo queueing and probably plummeting down to gold or beyond.
      
So I feel for you. I was lucky not to go through what you’re going through. I can’t imagine solo queueing today, losing game after game because of bad teammates or bad matchups and the game then bringing your certainty percentage down to keep you down. That’s the real problem with the MMR system, the certainty percentage lowers the more games you play and multiplies your RP by a lower number so you get less points. This is a problem for every player because it doesn’t change season by season. You’d basically have to get a 5 stack of players who have a higher MMR and keep “upgrading” your stack as they pull you up the MMR ladder. So many people are stuck in the middle and that’s how they want it to be. They want a nice bell curve. That’s all they care about.        
     
If you love the game, keep playing knowing your true level is not where the game is placing you. Take pride in your KD, take pride in carrying your team. That was my solace. In my mind I was a diamond level player trying to pull my friends up through the ranks. It made me feel better and I concentrated on improving. Watched pro league all the time to learn the game better. Then one day I had enough. I started realizing the game wasn’t as much fun as it used to be. It was a completely different game. So I stopped playing.      
      
If you still enjoy playing then my advice is don’t worry about your MMR. Keep improving. Then one day, buy a new account when it’s on sale for $5-10 and you might have better luck as you’d be effectively resetting your certainty percentage.    
Or make friends with better players and stack up. Either way, good luck, stay strong!",1727740887.0

They slow down and absorb water during rain events, which does a lot to help prevent flooding downstream and improve water quality.  Some urban areas are very sensitive to flooding risk due to the amount of impermeable surfaces, so they can become reliant on trees and other vegetation to control this water as a part of their stormwater management scheme.  Also, some areas that are highly concerned about water quality (such as the watershed for drinking water or places with a hefty fishing industry).

His parents also went behind his back and met with this woman even though he doesn’t want to be part of this. I’m upset for him, that he’s been deceived to probably be used for child support (surely she’ll want to get money from him hence she picked him), and also that his family didn’t stand by him, but appreciate this woman who has no morals only because they want a grandchild. I know his mistake was to trust her, but that doesn’t mean he has to put up with the situation and be forced into fatherhood/paying child support when he’s basically been used for his genes. I’m disgusted with the world we live in, and that it affects me as well so much. I don’t know how to look at this situation, so it seems better or that it won’t have an impact on my relationship with him. 
In my opinion, with proof of reproductive coercion which I believe this is, the victim should not be held responsible for the other person’s misbehaviour. Yes, the child is important, but how about we stop promoting this behaviour and hold women accountable too. How is it in the best interest of the child to be raised by one parent, especially when the parent clearly has no morals",1727740887.0

We’re fighting for equity in things like rights, pay, medical care, etc. Men already have that. Then there are things like the labor movement where it helps both from a gender and class perspective so women’s work in the labor movement also benefits working class men.

Because you can never have enough chile verde recipes , today we’re running Marcus Grymme’s recipe for DeeAnn Haroldsen and Bethany Layton and all you other La Puente and La Frontera lovers out there. Grymme used to live in Utah and has spent years sampling chile verdes in other parts of the country and Mexico in an attempt to duplicate the Utah dish until he decided to make his own. After numerous experimental batches, the key, Grymme says, is to use “tomatoes and tomatillos.” Grymme thinks this recipe comes pretty close.

Turn the slow-cooker on high heat and cover.
Meanwhile, dust the pork with flour, salt and pepper.
In a large frying pan over medium heat, warm the oil. Add the onions and garlic and saut&eacute; until the onions are tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer to the slow-cooker.
Add more oil and add the pork in batches, and cook until browned thoroughly. Transfer to the slow-cooker. Let cook in the in the slow-cooker on high for 2 hours.
After 2 hours, reduce the heat to medium or low and cook for at least another 2 hours. For very tender pork, cook on low heat for 8 or more hours.
Thirty minutes before serving, mix the cornstarch with water, and add it to the slow-cooker. Add more if you want to thicken it further.
Cover the bean burritos with the chile verde pork, and garnish with chopped onions and grated cheese.",1727740888.0

Maybe you don't like letting people get too close to you? Emotionally and physically? you have obsessions that you focus on..... The ships, and you will know more about your field of focus/obsession than most people will! Highly intelligent, but haven't channeled it, or been able to channel it in the way most people can. I'm getting emo, I think you probably love music, all genres from Elvis to K pop and J rock. You feel you are a friend of the earth. You love history too, Graham Hancock is amazing!! Probably well travelled but still have so many places to go. You probably have a bunch of friends, but rarely talk to them, you don't reply to them or try to keep in touch as much as you should. Passionate about lgbtq rights, but are straight. And equally passionate about black rights. Emotionally insecure and body issues. Don't think you are a toker, but probably smoke and drink more than is good for you. You are probably the most fun in the room at a party! And people envy your knowledge.

"Survival","t5_2qh7j","Wax is useful as a lubricant, as a waterproofing agent, and as a sealant.

Wax on clothing makes them water shedding. Try this on a cotton hat or denim jacket. Rub wax onto it and it'll become rain coat.

Running a metal tool back and forth a Ross a wedge of wax can provide rust proofness.

Adding a tiny bit of wax into a stiff hinge or socket and then working a mechanism can add lubrication. Clasp knife, gun action. (Note, not all waxed are the same, I'm usually basing these comments on beeswax).

If you form a paddle or have a paddle with you and water is dripping into your boat, you can coat it with wax and it'll shed the water on the upstroke faster and keep you dryer.

Assuming proper container access (ie mason jar or tin jar) pouring liquid wax over the top and filling the remaining space can make it somewhat airtight in Liu of full on canning.

I've personally done this with fruit or other perishables. You keep it stored inside wax and it stays fresh until you break it open. Example= most cheeses. Not the wedge cheese that is already cut, but a wheel of cheese which can be stored for a long time without refrigeration.",1727740888.0

They are supposed to do an interview with the meps commander or operations officer to then be allowed to process after the time has elapsed. 

We do still have ESL as an enlistment program that some soldiers can go to PRIOR to any mos training but there are certain testing requirements that have to be met.

The only way it takes 3 seconds is if you watch the sequence in 0.25×.   It happened in less than 1 second.   You're either too bedarded to realize you're watching a fast sport in slow motion or you're just a disingenuous fuck who argues from bad faith using lies and hyperbole. 

Pare stopped skating backward and stepped up to hit him - all within 1.5 seconds - which automatically brings your knee forward. He could have tried a hip check but that is more prone to whiffing and may have still hit the extended & exposed leg. Either way if Laine doesn't have his bambi legs extended he would be safe. 

Laine also doesn't have to carry it all the way and split d himself or go another way if he's covered by 2 players lol He was being stupid and careless trying to force a highlight. 

He could have easily passed it to wide open Roy, took advantage of 2 players on him and dumped it, or braced properly and reverse hit Pare head on - instead he tried to go end to end and split 2 defenders while hanging his legs out farther than anyone else in a dangerous position. 

Of course you will die on the hill of avoiding this reality and avoiding any responsibility to Laine.  

TLDR; it was not 3 seconds you liar & Laine skates directly into him with his own knee out. It was a braindead play which got himself hurt in meaningless preseason. No one is coached to go into contact with your legs exposed that far out like that because it is fucking dangerous.",1727740889.0

I put this together as research for the ending of ME3.  I also typed up the complete text of [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/rabyn/complete_text_from_me3_ending_pt_1_spoilers/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/rac5f/complete_text_from_me3_ending_pt_2_spoilers/) of the ME3 ending.


**Here's the conversation with Sovereign from ME1.**


Sovereign: You are not Saren.

Squadmate: What is that? Some kind of VI interface?

Sovereign: Rudimentary creatures of blood and flesh. You touch my mind, fumbling in ignorance, incapable of understanding.

Squadmate: I don't think this is a VI...

Sovereign: There is a realm of existence so far beyond your own you cannot even imagine it. I am beyond your comprehension. I am Sovereign!

Shepard: Sovereign isn't just some Reaper ship Saren found, it's an actual Reaper.

Sovereign: Reaper? A label created by the Protheans to give voice to their destruction. In the end, what they choose to call us is irrelevant. We simply are.

Squadmate: The Protheans vanished 50,000 years ago. You couldn't have been there. It's impossible!

Sovereign: Organic life is nothing but a genetic mutation, an accident. Your lives are measured in years and decades. You wither and die.

Sovereign: We are eternal. The pinnacle of evolution and existence. Before us, you are nothing. Your extinction is inevitable. We are the end of everything.

* (I don't stand alone!)
> Shepard: There is an entire galaxy of races united and ready to face you.

* (I'll stop you!)

* (You don't scare me!)
> Shepard: Whatever your plan is, it's going to fail. I'll make sure of that.

Sovereign: Confidence born of ignorance. The cycle cannot be broken.

Squadmate: Cycle? What cycle?

Sovereign: The pattern has repeated itself more times than you can fathom. Organic civilizations rise, evolve, advance. And at the apex of their glory, they are extinguished.

Sovereign: The Protheans were not the first. They did not create the Citadel. They did not forge the mass relays. They merely found them, the legacy of my kind.

* (I don't understand.)
> Shepard: Why would you construct the mass relays, then leave them for someone else to find?

* (You built them?)

* (You're lying!)
> Shepard: Why would you construct the mass relays, then leave them for someone else to find?

Sovereign: Your civilization is based on the technology of the mass relays, our technology. By using it, your society develops along the paths we desire.

Sovereign: We impose order on the chaos of organic evolution. You exist because we allow it. And you will end because we demand it.

Squadmate: They're harvesting us! Letting us advance to the level they need, then wiping us out!

Shepard: What do you want from us? Slaves? Resources?

Sovereign: My kind transcends your very understanding. We are each a nation. Independent, free of all weakness. You cannot even grasp the nature of our existence.

Shepard: Where did you come from? Who built you?

Sovereign: We have no beginning. We have no end. We are infinite. Millions of years after your civilization has been eradicated and forgotten, we will endure.

Shepard: Where are the rest of the Reapers? Are you the last of your kind?

Sovereign: We are legion. The time of our return is coming. Our numbers will darken the sky of every world. You cannot escape your doom.

Shepard: You're not even alive. Not really. You're just a machine. And machines can be broken!

Sovereign: Your words are as empty as your future. I am the vanguard of your destruction. This exchange is over.",1727740889.0

I think you’re setting the bar too high here. Is an 18 year old RB ready to pass block grown men? Probably not, he likely lacks technique. But plenty of NFL RBs lack pass blocking technique. Would an 18 year old Fournette be a valuable NFL player on first and second down? He probably would. Would 18 year old Julio Jones and AJ Green be able to beat NFL corners with their route running acumen? Probably not. Would they be able to cause defenses issues by running streaks and fighting for 50/50 balls? Almost certainly. No 18 year old is going to make the pro bowl but to say no one is pro ready before 20 is incorrect.",1727740889.0

"MechanicalEngineering","t5_2s8xv","If I were QA and had a BS already I would probably go for an MS, take more design courses, do a few self study projects with an eye to getting into a design role

The sweet spot would be a design role that needs an Engineer who realizes the need for Quality Design and making designs that can easily pass QA. (note this MIGHT be with a firm that has large quality problems and expect you to fix said problems)

But in a more benign case there are plenty of design roles which are more minute detail oriented that are perfect for an Engineer with a Quality background.

Há sempre muitas pessoas transitando e o policiamento me pareceu ok. Entretanto, eu ouvi de residentes que não é bom andar sozinho à noite pois ocorrem muitos assaltos. Além disso, eu também evitaria andar nas proximidades da estação central em qualquer horário do dia, porque há muitos usuários de drogas e me pareceu muuuito caótico.

  
Com relação aos preços, comprar roupas me pareceu bem em conta, principalmente se você visita os outlets na cidade (mas é uma atividade que vai tomar o dia todo, porque tem que garimpar).

"SuperMorbidlyObese","t5_j779r","I would say to start small - find a pool with hours that work for you.  Keep in mind that the best pool for you might be in a community center, a gym, a school, a college, or many other options.  I swim at LA fitness because it's close to my house, it's a good price, and the hours are convenient.

Then get essential gear - for me it's a swimcap, goggles and a swimsuit that is comfortable and practical (I wear swimshorts and a separate top).  Polyester or chlorine resistant last a lot longer.  A few months into it I also dug out my old fins, decided I hated them and bought some new better ones.  Fins are nice because they make your legs work harder and give you a good workout.  Some people like other gear, but that's all I use.

First workout - get in the pool!  Every pool has its own bit of etiquette, if you have any questions find a friendly face and ask.  (for instance, some pools set up fast/med/slow lanes and you circle swim in those lanes.  That's what I did when I swam at a community pool.  At the gym pool where I swim now we mostly split the lane and rarely circle). If you've done it before, pick a lane and start swimming a stroke that works for you, starting slow and easy.  If you're a newbie, you can walk a few laps before you give swimming a go.  Don't focus too much on how much you do the first time, just how it feels.  When you start getting tired, you can take a break at the side of the pool.  You can introduce yourself to someone if you want.  As you get more used to swimming, you can start swimming in sets if you want - like sets of 200 meters/yards where you swim fast and then do a relaxing lap.  Or you can just swim at a leisurely pace the whole time.  Mix up your strokes, it uses different muscles.  Then, when you've had enough, you can do some stretches and get out of the pool.  

Fun things you can also do in the pool:  I do calisthenics in the pool, using the resistance in the water to strengthen the muscles.  There are even foam or plastic pool ""weights"" you can use for this if you want.  Stretching feels good in the pool, I always stretch at the end and it feels really good.  

Other swim gear to consider buying:  swim shampoo, leave in conditioner, swim watch to count laps, kickboard, gym bag, gym lock, towel(s).  

Let me know if you have any specific questions!",1727740890.0

I fully admit the numbers are a total ass pull and would need to be tested, to be clear my ideas never getting put in the game so meh does not really matter. 

  
as it stands right now the game is the first few chases end quickly and the game is over, or the first few chases go poorly while survivors are on gens and the game is over. either way that chase makes or breaks everything and forces a camp out or tunnel vs any one good at the game. 

its stale and predictable, which is why survivors are so willing to give up. there is no hope or reward for sticking it up if its not already going well",1727740890.0

Based on the title of your post, it appears you're looking for a forgotten series. **When you find the series** you are looking for, it would be appreciated if you added the title of the series as a Flair by leaving a comment that says `solved = series name here`. That way others will know that the answer has been found. This also allows others that have become interested based off your description to try the series for themselves. Do please avoid adding additional formatting to your solved comment though as I read based off the source of your comment rather than like a human being.

"Mommit","t5_2s3i3","I get what you're saying, I agree it's important for children to experience struggle and frustrations, but  OP is giving consequences to her LO that may cause her to become upset - like removing the plant at her mum's when her child could not interact with it appropriately. She didn't passively let her destroy the plant, she removed it which could have frustrated the child but didn't. Same for redirecting, if a child is intent enough on something they will still be frustrated with a redirection but they often regulate sooner when they have something to move on to. Some of the ways we help children to regulate in schools is through a kind of ""distraction"" with calm down tools - breathing exercises, squishy balls, glitter bottles, sensory tools and the like. I would say OP is doing the opposite of passive parenting, she just seems to have a particularly agreeable child who is not so prone to heightened emotions (correct me if I'm wrong OP).

I agree that children need to be told no - especially in situations around safety. But you can let a child experience frustration, without actually saying the word ""no"". Reserving the word specifically for unsafe situations may even mean that it carries more power in that situation.",1727740891.0

Unfortunately, the lady’s thumb has gone to seed so it’s about to get worse…way way worse… I’m shocked by how fast this grows and in the most desolate and barren of places. And the creeping buttercup can only be eradicated with glyphosate because it has branching stolons so pulling one just causes the others it’s connected to (which you can rarely see) to go absolutely wild.

We had a ‘21 RAV4 XLE lease that we really loved, but with two 100 lbs dogs and a baby on the way, we wanted to be able to pack up everyone and go with a little extra room for cargo. When the lease was up last January, we traded up for a ‘21 Highlander Premium with 32k miles. The V6 provides more getup on the interstate, the third row has come in handy dozens of times when family visits or we pick up friends, and the dogs fit comfortably together when the third row is laid flat, allowing us to keep the second row clean and free of slobber and hair. It was more expensive for sure (MSRP $36k when we bought the RAV4, then paid $44k for the highlander due to inflation and the Premium trim level). The Highlander has been flawless and while the 21 combined mpg hurts compared to the RAV4’s 32, it fits every other need perfectly and we’ll never get rid of it!",1727740892.0

Unless it’s a closed book exam, I cannot conceive of a way a professor could legitimately ban something like Photomath for out of class assignments. There’s just absolutely no way to enforce it. AND ITS NOT CHEATING! OP did the work themselves. They used a tool strategically to get themselves un-stuck. That’s legit.",1727740892.0
"Semaglutide","t5_3zc11u","One last comment for you, because google is an excellent tool:

A **calorie** is measured by determining the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. This measurement can be done using a device called a **calorimeter**.

In the context of food, calories are typically measured using a **bomb calorimeter**. Here’s how it works:

1. A sample of food is placed in a sealed container (the “bomb”) within the calorimeter.
2. The food is then burned, and the heat released during combustion raises the temperature of the surrounding water.
3. By measuring the increase in water temperature, scientists can calculate the amount of energy (in calories) the food contains.

This process provides the **gross energy** of the food. However, the calories listed on nutrition labels account for the body’s digestion and absorption, resulting in the **net energy** value.

While bomb calorimeters are used in scientific settings, food manufacturers typically rely on standardized data for nutrient components (carbohydrates, fats, proteins) to estimate calories, using established formulas.",1727740892.0

"AmIOverreacting","t5_4uoy2u","I don’t know what state you’re in, but as long as neither of you are a legally unfit parent, you’ll both have a lot of time with the kids. Heck, a judge ruled my ex was an unfit parent, and she still got Fridays and every other Saturday with them (later cut down more due to other harmful behavior).

So, assume 50/50 time unless there is a good reason why that would be harmful to the kids.

If you are in a community property state, you both equally have rights to everything accumulated in the marriage.

But you shouldn’t be asking us! Go consult with a local divorce lawyer that can tell you how your state or region does it.

And if you can’t stimulate a deal, push for mediation over going to court. As my attorney told me one, the only divorce cases they get decided by a judge involve at least one parent with a personality disorder or other mental illness, or LOTS of money.

Hopefully you can both remind each other that you are fighting FOR the kids, not OVER the kids.",1727740892.0

It’s a racial fact that Asians are the least likely to get divorced. It’s a racial fact that Africans have the highest chances of getting divorced.

Honestly, when I went bald young I got a bit of shit from the guys, some girl would point and laugh, but the actual jokes and digs didn't really bother me - heck, I even laughed at some of the more creative ones. What rocked and still rocks my world was the underlying attitudes they revealed: people really did think lesser of me because I had a few less strands of keratin on my head. The girls no longer considered me a romantic prospect. The men no longer respected me or would allow me to be a leader of the group. Even forgetting the jokes, the world just became a little colder when I went bald. People smiled less. I stopped getting the benefit of the doubt in social situations. The non-verbal stuff, like people freezing you out of conversations, girls not inviting you to talk and hang out, hurt me a lot more than the old Baldy McBaldy remark.",1727740894.0

While we had far less technological and medical advances, at the start of the 20th century, you were either renting or paying off a mortgage or actually had it paid, insurance was around but not super common, medical bills weren't astronomical, you basically just had to pay for housing and food, that is, if you didn't have other means.

We also had utilities, then we became more reliant on electricity, and then we got more utilities that used them. It also became common to own a car and increasingly, more people required them to get around, and that came with its own expenses.

If you wanted to have a telephone, that cost more money. Premium television (cable and satellite)? More money. Then came home computers and video game systems, which weren't a necessity but often required updates and new systems entirely to keep up with the latest technology.

Then internet, another bill, and wouldn't you know? Our society became increasingly dependent on it. Now they want to sell you a lot of stuff by subscription.

Admittedly, some of this stuff, you can opt out. But very much, tech and progress nickel and dimed up the cost of living over the 20th century and the start of the 21st to where nickels and dimes won't buy you jack.",1727740894.0

So was this during high school she’d go crazy on her fam? Or during quarantine? I remember she did a live at her dads during then, just don’t know when else it would’ve happened.

I think she’s painted herself into a corner. It’s obvious she sooooo badly wants to wife up a pro athlete, but they’re only going to want to fuck her some then move on. And after seeing these IG pics she’s used that aren’t her, I wouldn’t be surprised if those posts about her wife and mom goals are just a show to try and secure the bag. But it takes 5 seconds to google and find out she has an OF and she has no other way of making money, so she pretty much has to keep doing it until she finds a rich dude she can hang on to.

"PeterExplainsTheJoke","t5_121h8r","I don’t need to know whatever your style is when you’ve openly stated that you’re so unwilling to compromise on aesthetics that you, no matter how much you want to bitch and moan about it, are willing to sacrifice functionality.

You might think that other people are having their cake and eating it too, but that’s because you don’t have a clue what they’re actually prioritizing, what they value, or what they’re willing to compromise on.

Most men prioritize functionality first and foremost, with comfort coming second, and an EXTREMELY low bar to clear for aesthetics following that. Hence why all these varied men’s fashions you seem to insist we have are effectively just the same basic elements in different materials and colors.

By your own admission; you, like most women, prioritize looks above all else, and are saying it’s wrong for women’s clothing designers to take the same approach. They start with the looks(which with women’s clothing usually starts with trying to get a specific silhouette) and then they see whatever function can be squeezed into the overly precise and minimally adjustable design. Men’s clothing typically starts with functionality in mind and then occasionally slaps some color or patterns on top. You’re basically complaining that the super compact Volkswagen Beetle you bought because it was cute can’t match the horsepower and room of a pickup truck with an engine bigger than your entire car, and using the fact that the cars built around that engine and with hauling as a first priority have that high performance capability to say that the car dealership somehow tricked you or ripped you off while simultaneously failing to acknowledge the severe loss of fuel economy those trucks and the people driving them have agreed to compromise on in exchange for those high levels of performance.

Finally; I have just as much right to have and express my opinion as anyone else, and if you’re going to insist on complaining and demanding that others make changes to accommodate your limitless entitlement; people have every right to call you out and push back against what you’re demanding of them. If you insist on making your self inflicted issues into other people’s problems, it’s ABSOLUTELY reasonable for people to deal with YOU as a bigger problem than whatever you insist on whining about.

ABSOLUTELY NOBODY has ANY obligation to placate you. ABSOLUTELY NOBODY has ANY obligation give in to your demands. ABSOLUTELY NOBODY has ANY obligation WHATSOEVER to kowtow to you or change things just because you demand it. I’m sure that comes as a shock to you.",1727740895.0

In a statement on Sunday, GCC Secretary General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi affirmed the GCC's steadfast stances in support of the fraternal Lebanese people and its continuous backing for Lebanon's sovereignty, security, and stability.

He emphasized the necessity of an immediate ceasefire and refraining from engaging in regional conflicts to prevent the expansion of the dispute in the region.

He also reiterated the points made in the ministerial statement of the GCC countries, which call for the full implementation of Security Council Resolution 1701, which emphasizes the need for Israel to respect Lebanese borders and for the Lebanese government to exercise control over all Lebanese territories, in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions and the Taif Agreement. This is essential for Lebanon to fully exercise its sovereignty, ensuring that no weapons exist without the approval of the Lebanese government and that no authority exists other than its own.

"fivethirtyeight","t5_2rxlz","The US military has been attacked lately by Iranian-backed militias, most notably including an attack on the Baghdad Diplomatic Services Compound on Sept. 10, but all these attacks have been pretty ineffectual. The Houthis (also Iranian-backed) have shot down several Reaper drones lately too, but apparently they couldn't hit US Navy destroyers with 23 missiles on Thursday (bottom of [the ISW report](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-september-27-2024) before references). One of two Navy carrier strike groups that was sent to protect Israel against Iranian retaliation for assassinating Ismail Haniyeh (and like half of Hezbollah since!!) is still waiting around for Iran to put their missiles where their mouth is...

...But yeah, no attacks on Americans outside Iraq / Syria lately AFAIK, let alone attacks against US territory. Even then Biden probably wouldn't order a ground invasion; those apparently went out of style after Iraq & Afghanistan. If another 9/11-level attack happened though, it'd probably depend on specifics. It was one thing to rally around a recently ""elected"" Republican incumbent, but I feel like the xenophobic strongman doomer candidate could find himself well-positioned to exploit several hypothetical scenarios that wouldn't seem less plausible than the ones favoring Harris.",1727740896.0

"Gunners","t5_2qhqt","How can you be so sure about Merino starting over Partey? I'm not saying you can't be right, but how are you this sure? Especially since there are multiple factors at play here. One being that play different positions - Merino being 8 and Partey being 6. Which means there's also the question of which position works the best for Rice. Previously, when Rice played at 6, he was far from impressive in the build up. We don't have much of a clue about whether he has improved there enough to be elite.

The other thing is, Merino was far from a marquee signing. To me, he seems like a Trossard, Tomiyasu type signing that can plug multiple holes and provide smart depth everywhere vs someone we build our squad around. He will have every chance to win a starting job but it's far from his from the beginning.

But I could be wrong.",1727740896.0

"Incontinence","t5_2v137","When you’re under, you won’t have to worry about any of that. You won’t feel pain, you won’t panic, and the surgeons will clean it up immediately. 

If the surgery is on the urethra, they will already have a plan in place for these surgeries. It’s not the nurse you want to talk to, because there’s a good chance they won’t know. Instead you really want to talk to the surgeon. They’ll have performed this surgery and similar surgeries many times before, and they will already know how they want to handle urination during the time that you are under. 

If they can catheterise you after the procedure, that would be ideal. If they can’t, it may be that they can use one of those newer external catheters that lay along the vulva and immediately absorb urine and suction in away from the body and into a container. It may be that you can use pads and position yourself so that the urine flows away from the woundsite (on your front, or with the bed mattress tilted slightly up/down). But without knowing about the surgery, and more importantly, speaking to the surgeon, none of us can know. 

In terms of embarrassment, surgeons are kind of the last people it’s worth being embarrassed in front of. During surgeries they get pissed on, there’s shit, there’s pus, there’s bile, they’re regularly dealing with the worst of smells, I’ve even seen YouTube shorts from a surgeon about how they handle it if someone suddenly starts their period during surgery. There is no part of the human body that an experienced surgeon is embarrassed or judgemental about; they’ve seen it all a hundred times. There’s going to be nothing about your body or your incontinence that will be especially upsetting or confusing to them. At the very most, this will be an interesting problem for them to work around, but even that is exceptionally unlikely. 

A lot of people are incontinent, especially women. Doctors are for the most part very used to dealing with this issue. Urological surgeons are going to have more experience than most. 

In short, you need to talk to the surgeon. ",1727740896.0

Like, the shot where we see the first bone cage falls to the bottom of the chasm in DMC is ripped straight from a Wile E. Coyote cartoon where he falls off the cliff. Later on in that same movie, when Jack falls in the grave, him sticking his head up is punctuated by a bassoon sting in the score; that's some straight up Carl W.

I’ve been telling these idiotic companies to pound sand for almost a decade now, and I’ve never been sued. They’re cowards that prey on other people’s inexperience and fear.

Even if your video was “slanderous” and defamatory, I highly doubt they’d be able to remotely prove it in court. I also highly doubt you orchestrated this huge vindictive campaign like they claim either, it’s just a bunch of legal mumbo jumbo. If it gives you peace of mind, take it down within the 5 days.

"HouseOfTheDragon","t5_27hnjr","The appeal is that it was a GOT prequel. And GOT had a mass appeal that isn’t related to George RR Martin. The vast majority of people who watched the show gave never read the books. 

Regarding F&B specifically as an adaptation, George wrote a “story” that is essentially an outline and the schtick of that “story” is that it *wasn’t* a traditional narrative. It was a neat commentary on the nature of how history got recorded and passed down. If he wanted a show to be more aligned to his vision, then he should have written an actual book about this event and these characters. But he didn’t, and now he’s whining about stupid things like Helaena not liking to ride her dragon in the show meanwhile it wasn’t said *anywhere* in F&B that this was one of her greatest joys in life. 

I think HOTD engages with its source material in interesting and fun ways by showing how they characters could end up getting remembered in certain ways hundreds of years later even though the histories aren’t actually accurate reflections of who they were. But regardless of whether or not you like this, the fact is the dance in F&B was unadaptable as it was.",1727740898.0

"DynastyFF","t5_2umu4","A couple of things here.

>CJ Stroud has 2 career games above 25 points. 3 above 22. Daniels has 3 25-pointers in 4 starts. He's also won 3 of his first 4 starts. He's also just plain playing terrific, passing the eye test with flying colors.
>
>CJ Stroud is Baker Mayfield or Jared Goff or Brock Purdy or Kirk Cousins on steroids. Low-end QB1. He's ridiculously good in real life, but not giving you meaningful WAR. It takes crazy outlier seasons (Tom Brady or Manning-like record breaking seasons) to finish QB1 with a profile like Stroud's.

You're not valuing Stroud as highly as he's valued because you expect him to be QB1, it's about longevity, consistency and stability.  Putting him in the same convo as Baker or Goff or Kirk who have neither the consistency nor the long term stability is just your bias talking here, it's not a serious take at all.  You don't value Stroud to get a QB1 season, you value him to get 10 QB4-10 seasons.  

and yes, Daniels has more 25 point games and 22 point games, but those are arbitrary numbers you picked to boost your case for JD.  I could turn around and say that Stroud has 2 games above 30+ and JD has none, therefore he's got a higher ceiling.  That's dumb logic, but that's the same level of logic you're using here. 

Stroud has played 18 full games in his career.  He has  crested 20 points in 8 of those 18 games.  Could daniels do that?   sure, he's well on his way, but lets see a full season before we go and claim anything.  Dnaiels has played 4 mediocre to bad defenses and has run a passing game that's largely at the line of scrimmage.  It's too early to just expect that his current pace keeps up.  He's looked great, but averaging 23.7 ppg is a tough task for a full season.  Stroud averged 19.75 last season in his full games, and even finishing that high would be impressive for JD on a full season.  Lets see him play defenses that adjust to him and force him to play less conservatively.  23.7 ppg would have been QB 2 in ppg last year, ahead of Lamar, Hurts and Dak, which is just not something i'm betting on for a full season.

>If I'm trying to win my league, I don't want to play it safe. I don't need 18 PPG for a decade.

i mean, Stroud is averaging 19.1 ppg in his full game's played over this season and last.  Call it safe all you want but that would have 10 ppg is solidly a 5-8 range QB and having that over the course of a season is powerful.  You can make up the advantages elsewhere

>But, barring injury, Jayden Daniels will almost certainly outscore CJ Stroud this year because of his rushing floor and great passing combination.

Daniels hasn't really done much as a passer at all though outside of Week 3, the rest of the time he's been operating at the line of scrimmage primarily.  We don't know enough yet.  More importantly ""barring injury"" is an insane caveat to gloss over for a running QB.  He's on pace for over 200 carries this year, that's a lot of hits to be taking.  Running QBs get hurt quite a bit.  It's an important risk factor to consider.

>Find me a QB who looked this good this early, both in real life and in fantasy, who ends up being a bust.

I didn't say he was going to be a bust, i said that declaring JD a better fantasy QB than Stroud in a dynasty lense is premature.  

your process so far is ""I'm going to make a multi season bet on a player who's played 4 games against bad defenses"".

It doesn't matter if you end up being right, you're making a decalration without nearly enough info to do so.  If a redraft league had a player take Jordan Mason in the second round, Them turning out to be right on that bet doesn't make it good process.  The odds that Daniels maintains a 22+ ppg average is not nearly as high as you make it out to be, and you're just assuming health.  Its fine to make a bet, but that doesn't make it smart, even if you end up being right.",1727740899.0

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Basically, one of strongest instincts inside our the x-million old lizard brains is to obsess over stimulus that causes us fear and anger, and modern media is essentially a massive 25/7 click farm that instigates & perpetuates that response. If ad revenue is a watermill, the outrage economy is the river that powers it.


When the homo sapien is in a prolonged state of fear like modern media likes to induce, many of its higher functions simply shut down. Empathy, logic, patience, communication, forgiveness- everything that elevates it from mere ape to humanity is lost in the flood of cortisol, adrenaline, and whatever else poison is spewed out by the amygdala. All else is out aside so that the great primate can pound its chest and scream. That way the tiger in the brush might not attack.


A human in this state is unreasonable because reason doesn't protect from a tiger's claws. They are violent, because kindness isn't helpful against a tiger. And they are selfish because it's everyone for themselves when a tiger attacks.


People in this state (which they are perpetually in thanks to living in the Internet age) are eminently manipulable. Simply point over their shoulder and say ""the tiger's there!"". Even if all they hit are shadows, they will love you for warning them.


How does this connect to right wing movements? Well, the single consistent quality amongst such self-identified parties is fear. Fear of the black man. Fear of the working woman. Fear of co-ed bathroom. Fear of cat-eating immigrants. Fear of the allmighty Jew. Danger is all they can talk about, think about. And beyond the posturing and double talk, they have no real platform for progress. It's like asking the ape what to do about the tiger. ""Kill!"" it will screech, ""Kill! Kill! Kill!""",1727740900.0

"AmIOverreacting","t5_4uoy2u","Oh boy. That’s a lot. I’m not a professional, of course, but I have a life of experience. To me, it just seemed likely she’d experienced some trauma somewhere. This can mean she’s going to find ways to push people away. But this part is very important. Another person’s trauma is not implicit permission to mistreat others. Never. She is mistreating you. And if you too have some background with trauma, that could mean you’re more likely to excuse some stuff and continue to be the punching bag. We can make excuses and truly believe that if we just do enough of the right things, we can fix the people in our life. Unfortunately, we may overestimate what we can truly do if the other person is going to repeat the same cycle over and over. There is a time we have to admit to ourselves, mostly, that we just don’t have the emotional resources to fix people. And by insisting we can, we keep ourselves from the joy and strength we get from healthy attachments. You can acknowledge she hasn’t had things easy and that she has experienced pain and trauma, but also that you cannot continue if the process is slowly (or quickly) breaking you down. I’m sorry. I’m sorry she has pain and inflicts it on you, and that it puts you in this position. You’ve already mentioned that she is unwilling to consider any kind of therapy or even anger management. Your boundaries have been blurred. They have not been respected. You sound like an intelligent and giving person who has so much empathy, you’re almost running out of it for yourself. She’s made it clear she considers harmony as an obligation. Who does that? As I said, I’m not a professional in this stuff, but my sister has, well, issues. I’ve learned a lot dealing with her over many years. Have you heard of Borderline Personality disorder? I shouldn’t veer off too much because I don’t want you to get further into trying to diagnose her, but it sounds similar. Regardless, establish some boundaries and if she’s still not willing to respect them, you should keep reminding yourself that you deserve a happy and harmonious relationship. You do deserve that, even if it’s first a harmonious relationship with yourself before you attempt to start a new one. It doesn’t mean you don’t care for her, but please care for you. It doesn’t seem like she can do that.",1727740901.0

Sometimes she’s hellbent on running the OIAR and seems to know more than she’s letting on/being supernaturally drawn to it… other times she’s incredibly immature and just kind of dumb/annoying. Even if it was naivety, after multiple massively traumatic events any remotely sane person would decide this wasn’t worth pursuing. When she laughed after finding out Lena was fired I was excited that we were finally seeing the real Gwen (maybe an evil power hungry character) but then she quickly reverted to being dumb again. If I didn’t have such faith in the writers I would assume it was poor writing of a stereotype (be careful what you wish for/getting in over your head). It’s almost like she has a split personality.

"youtube","t5_2qh44","I think you should take an ethics class. 

Mr Beast’s money making is hugely exploitative of people desperate for money, leading to injuries hushed up by NDAs and literal torture of at least one person for the entertainment of millions. In my psychology classes, we go over cases of research whose results have made a tangible positive effect on society but were incredibly unethical and changed how we conduct research. 

The Tuskegee Syphilis experiment relied on the poor and desperate by giving them money/health services for getting their blood drawn. What for? To develop a treatment for Syphilis, which the researchers knew they had but didn’t inform them about, leading to more than 100 deaths. All this despite the fact that the research of these men had indeed led to successful treatment. They simply never bothered to give it to the men they exploited, leading to their deaths. 

Nowadays, ethics boards are dedicated to denying out the experiments that rely on the poor and desperate. You’re not allowed to give huge amounts of money for participation, like Mr Beast does, because they recognize that will mean the poor will be the ones to shoulder the burden of being experimented on because they need that large amount of money the most.  

Much like how the poor are the ones participating in Mr Beast’s squid games and then getting fucking injured and being forced to go hungry/live in filth and etc, while Mr Beast mugs at the camera. 

Like, sure, they solved Syphilis, but they were still exploitative and evil despite the good it did. Mr Beast is not at that scale of evil. He’s more Carnegie or Ford. But the point still stands that it puts a bad taste in a lot of people’s mouths to try and separate his charity from his exploitation. Like giving homeless people money on camera—the charity IS the exploitation. Philanthropy 101, you know.",1727740901.0

McNamara was LBJ’s Sec. of Def. and was instrumental in promoting the Vietnam War, supposedly to prevent communism taking over the world by Domino Effect, and also grow the Military-Industrial Establishment. He shrunk away as the war went badly, into the private sector and then, decades later, he apologized and said it was all a big goof, to improve his standing.

"digimon","t5_2rxw7","I have never, ever, ever, ever liked light novels, I think a *lot* of the writer's talent is usually lost in translation--they're not hiring Stephen King to translate these things, you know?

Manga is pure dialogue, so it's easier to translate the lines spoken in a way that conveys the spirit of the thing being said (and for everything else there's the many translator's footnotes that tend to show up in localised manga), but prose is poetry, it's metaphor and simile and cultural context, and that is much, much harder to translate organically. So, light novels always come across as really, really wooden to me.

And frankly, one need only look at the Digimon Reference Book to see Bandai isn't even hiring humans at all to translate this stuff, it's all machine-translated, and so that awkwardness is multiplied by a thousand. And then there's even more awkwardness, because these aren't even light novels, they're *web* novels! So I have to sit at my computer in order to read a book--you know, the way books were made to be read! /s

So...... yeah. I know you don't want ""it should've been an anime"" comments, but frankly, it's my thoughts and opinions on Liberator. It *should* have been an anime.

I wish I could have helped I really do. But I was just too young, and making barely more than minimum wage.

My parents didn't help me through my education, but I still felt like I would have wanted to help. My parents never ever asked me but I still feel guilty.

There may be limits to age as well, e.g. no more than two children under 2 without a second adult present.

A neck sprain, whiplash, back ache because you hit a car with 2 occupants can be easily 100k+. You will have to talk to the adjustor assigned to your case to see what demand letter they have received. Just because the other party said they need 100k doesn't mean they get 100k. It has to be substantiated with evidence. The insurance company has a duty to defend you, and they will offer your policy limits for the other party to go away. If they agree, all well and good. If they don't, then depending on how the case goes, you may owe beyond your policy limits - wage garnishment, stocks or other liquid assets.


Take a breath. Most cases don't go that far. Talk to your adjustor tomorrow and come back and update this thread and we may then be able to offer more advise.",1727740903.0

"AsianBeauty","t5_2w0u7","Kose Softymo Speedy Cleansing Oil. 

First bought it in Japan in 2016, it was on a super sale for 500 yen for the bottle and 230 yen for the refills at a local drugstore near my host grandmother's place. I had tried cleansing oils before, so I knew what it was, I just wanted something cheap since I was a student on a budget. I've probably repurchased the refill packs over 30 times since then, am still using the original bottle I purchased. Hands-down, this is my all-time favorite product, even my husband gets me a refill when he notices I'm low! It gets all my makeup and sunscreen off - even the Judydoll mascara slides right off. If I use on a more bare-face and massage for a couple of min, it helps to remove my oil plugs. I notice a difference using this before a water based cleanser, like my face just does not feel as clean and soft if I don't use it as a first cleanser. It's also a watery-ish consistency and on the thinner side which personally I love. The DHC cleansing oil and others like it, I cannot stand as I find them to be too thick.",1727740904.0

"horror","t5_2qh9x","First, I'm not stopping anyone from posting. Free speech and all that. That said..

For those not already aware of it Dreadit has a movie guide.  
With many different categories.  
Among them are ""Horror Comedies"".

That said I wasn't about to look at all 400+ reponses to see if someone added something interesting.  
In fact this question, even if you thought it needed to be posted again, should be done as a poll.  
The reason is obvious. Sifting through hundreds of comments is impractical and time consuming.  
  
But this group doesn't allow polls.  
To paraphrase what I remember the explanation of why that is, is that people kept polling the same topics/questions/ideas over and over, versus just doing a search on the group for the answer.  
So by creating lists(data bases) people would stop.  
At least that was the hope.

So now we have the worst of all worlds.  
People don't use the database.  
People still ask the same questions over and over, but in an impractical non-polling format.  
  
Maybe they should go back to allowing polls.  
The questions would still be repetitive.  
While the answers wouldn't be better than the database, they would be better then what we have now.

They could have stopped the kid before he got that close, and could have grabbed literally any body part that wasn't his neck with both hands.

"NewRiders","t5_3hdbs","K...  Lot of questions there.  Let's start with the fact that you have a bi-directional quickshifter.  Welcome to the future.  Basically, use the clutch when you're starting from a stop, and when you come to a complete stop.  As others have said, whenever your clutch is in, you are coasting.  Coasting means you are not in control of your bike.  Especially as a new rider, you should avoid defaulting to ""out of control"".  I don't care what any MSF coach tells you... Coasting is not good riding technique. 

Upshifting... If you're out having a spirited ride, upshift in the top quarter of your rev range.  That's where all your power is, so you should enjoy it.  If you're just bopping around town, there's nothing wrong with short shifting (shifting at low rpm's).  I haven't ridden a GSX-8R yet, but most quickshifters have an rpm threshold.  You probably have to be at at least 3-4000 rpm for it to work.  Also, stay on the throttle when using your quickshifter up.

Downshifting... Two basic reasons to downshift - 1) increase your revs and put you in the power band.  2) put you in an appropriate gear to match your speed as you decelerate.  To use the quickshifter down, there's likely a maximum rpm and you have to be off the throttle.  If you use it without your clutch, welcome to the glorious world (and sounds) of engine braking.  Even if you're using engine braking to slow down, it's still good practice to give your front brake just enough of a squeeze to activate the brake lights. Squeeze the clutch just as you finally come to a stop.

Rev Matching... Why bother?  It's 2024 and you have a modern bike that will rev match for you.  Sure, learn it down the road, but at this point, nah... No need.

Braking... Honestly don't bother with your rear brake outside of parking lot driving.  You have a sport bike.  Use the front. 

Trail braking... At your pace you don't really need to trail brake at all.  You'd be shocked at the speeds you can take a corner at on a sport bike.  I remember the first time an instructor told me a turn was a 80-90mph 3rd gear turn on the throttle.  I was like ""no way.  Go fuck yourself with that nonsense."". And then I followed him through the turn, and damned if he wasn't right.  All that is to say, at normal street pace, especially beginner street pace, you don't need to trail brake.  It is, however, an excellent idea to understand what trail breaking is and good practice to have a couple percent of front brake going into a turn.  Loading your front suspension gives you the ability to react to unexpected things.  Coasting on the other hand, does not.  The MSF technique of doing all your braking before the turn and then coasting to the speed is... Dumb and potentially dangerous.  Track riders on the other hand, trail brake in a way that isn't ideal for the street either.  On track, the goal is to brake as late and deep into a turn as possible. A couple percent front, quickly ramping up to 70-90% brakes to show hard, and then ""trail off"" the brakes as you add lean angle and head to the slowest part of the turn (not always the apex).  Riding like that in the street is reckless.  On the street, your goal isn't lap times, it's getting home in one piece and enjoying the ride.

F*ck MSF...  They teach you how to do u turns in a parking lot and not much more.  The program hasn't evolved in decades despite the technology in bikes evolving like crazy.  Learn from courses that teach you how to ride bikes how they were designed to be ridden.  The most affordable and beginner friendly is definitely ChampU.  Take that online.  Any time they contradict MSF, ChampU is right, and MSF is wrong.  Hell... One of the track coaches at my local org also teaches MSF and she just talks shit on it constantly.",1727740905.0

this is not an issue where you need to bail straight away. you can talk to your gm about this, and about how you feel like you're not contributing and your choices aren't considered. 

and definitely tell them to stop giving you grief for trying to engage with the game, cos that's the quickest way for you not to.

"relacionamentos","t5_vp2cd","Seu namorado é um babaca por diversos fatores. 

Nem tudo é regra, mas cai bem ter bom senso algo que falta nele. 

Eu sou mulher, trabalho com TI e infelizmente meus amigos são a maioria homens PORQUE É O QUE TEM, eu me forço sair pra lugares só pra fazer amizades femininas. Meus amigos sempre respeitaram meu relacionamento e, inclusive, sequer nos tratamos íntimos porque as namoradas deles não gostam e eu respeito. Faço de tudo pra não dar BO. Eles lá eu aqui. 

Tenho amizades com homens porque meus estudos e trabalho condicionam a isso, mas evito sempre que possível e meu namorado entende. 

Meu namorado trabalha com investimentos (ambiente masculino) e tem 2 amigas próximas. Uma delas é super respeitosa e não causa problemas, já a outra quis competir atenção… Falei que não era bacana e isso causava insegurança no relacionamento e ele, por bom senso, cortou contato com ela já que ela não respeitava. 

Uma coisa é o nosso caso que temos amizades do sexo oposto e fazemos por onde merecer essas amizades. 

Outra coisa é seu cara que da todos os sinais pra te deixar insegura e não tá nem aí para o que você sente. 

Homem só respeita um tipo de mulher: a que mostra que não tá brincando. Ela vai embora (e ele sofre, mas não volte) ou faz pior. Ou você vai embora ou faz pior. 

Se vc já explicou e ele cagou na sua cabeça vai embora porque é só ladeira a baixo…. ou simplesmente pergunte pra ele se ele concorda com esse comportamento e se você pode fazer igual 

Daí você põe senha no seu celular e não deixa ele mexer, comece a se arrumar mais que o normal e apareça pela casa feliz cantando pro vento, aparece com amizade masculina e comece a rir olhando pro celular….

Ou vai embora OU FAZ PIOR pra dar o exemplo e RESISTA até o fim. Se ele achar ruim DEBOCHE! diga “então você não gosta? Pois bem… tô esperando vc excluir fulana senão tô tranquila”

Se você aceitar isso ele não vai te respeitar NUNCA, ele tá testando seu limite. Um sem noção",1727740907.0

What is the justification to gouge overnight parkers? Greed? 

This has nothing to do with entitlement. There are not ANY reasonable alternatives except to get gouged. All of your suggestions are silly as you obviously only consider your own perspective. 

How about you arrive at the airport 4 hours early and find that all the off-airport parking is full. And you have 6 large luggage for the 6 other people that are with you. And then you are forced to pay the excessive rates to park over night at the airport because you have no other choice. Let’s see how happy you are then. Good to know that you don’t mind spending an extra 6k when it used to cost under 2k. You have a rich persons detached attitude. I’m not surprised.

The issue is not parking overnight at the airport. The issue is not enough parking in the area.  Instead of gouging, how about SM build multi-level parking decks in terminal 1 and 2 parking?  Oh that would cost them money. They only care about filling their own pockets.

"houseplants","t5_2skiq","[This is the pole](https://amzn.to/4gPLab9) mine is on; plastic is perfect for them. It’s a pretty lightweight plant so you don’t have to worry about it toppling over; plus since it’s got a closed back, it retains moisture soo much longer so you don’t have to water it as often. I water mine once a week. If you’re using soil, time it with when you’re watering the plant so you don’t accidentally overwater the planter. To water it I washed out a root beer bottle, poked some holes in the cap (I used a soldering gun but you can get creative it’s just plastic), fill it up with water, and just pop it at the top of the pole. It slow releases the water so that it doesn’t fly out of the holes in the front as it’s making its way down. The pic is of it water the deliciosa, but i do the same with the adansonii. If you’re using semihydro, feel free to just water it whenever you want. The excess water will flow to the reservoir to be used by the plant.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","I personally play board games. There's a local game shop with board game nights that anyone can show up for, and that's a good first step. Find someone setting up for a game and ask if they'd be willing to teach a newbie. If that's not your jam, what is? You can find meetups for crafting, volunteering, business networking, nanowrimo is still a thing and has a strong community, and there are subreddits for all the major metros. 

  
It's a struggle connecting with people on a personal level, especially when you're shy. The biggest key is just to keep being there. Find something with the kind of people you want to connect with and keep showing up.

There's no way in the world Kamala Harris being the second half of the Biden -Harris Administration will not be negatively affected by this strike.


Yet last year when he was safely a Sure Shot for nomination for a second term as president, Joe Biden crushed a Railroad Strike before it's even began. The railroad stripe was justified as the railroads were treated employees like garbage. Denying them sick days and punishing them with retaliatory action if they did take sick days. Forced overtime with retaliatory action if they requested time off immediately afterwards. Deferred pay raises and working months without labor contract. Refusal to supply an adequate supply of sick, vacation and personal days. Especially holiday time with family.
Biden crushed the rail Union hours before a major strike and forced them all to on binding arbitration. In the end all the real workers got was modest raises with the false promise that the time off issue will be settled ""on the side"". 
I'm a railroad worker & I can tell you from what I hear via my local BMWE , they were lied to. To this date Biden has done nothing to address the time off issue meanwhile they are all forced now locked into a multi-year contract they cannot break!
But oh no Biden said, we can't have a Railroad Strike, ""it'll cripple the economy""
But now all of a sudden a shipping Port strike which starts to freeze all Commerce is not going to hurt the economy? What changed? Joe's not running anymore! He's bitter he was kicked out in favor of Kamala. This is his way of getting back at the Democrat Party that kicked him out of what he believed to be as rightful reelection campaign, his to lose or win.


There's no other reason whatsoever for the discrepancy and President Biden's sudden lack of care for the consequences of such a national strike.",1727740908.0

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","I've caught a couple and gave them away

And i have also have caught and kept when i was around  no one (the mets sucked for years so it was easier qhen i was a teenager)

The reality is, you will forget about that ball or stop caring about it really quick, its more fun to tell people you caught a ball as a story then a momento

And honestly the kid probably will too, but when i got a ball as a kid i used to bring it to school at show and tell and show people when they came over like it was a charm in my life.

So instead of seeing it as ""i got it you, i deserve it"". Just think about the hours and days of joy you could bring to some kid, with a 2 second gesture. 

You might not like it, but the old guy is right, it means more. And if you thought about it, you would probably find joy in thinking you made an amazing story for that kid.",1727740908.0

Both keeps are ghosting keep. Now my alt only got one archer pvp march and 2.3m ground for defend. I trained 11k each ground layers until t9 to defend. Elise and leonidas on wall so far.  Since it’s an alt.  I didn’t coin it. Used to loot all the rss from dead keeps to  upgrade the buildings. Always active during barba and pyramid event for max gems reward.  Svs is the best for gems and blood of ares.  My Minamoto and Elise all 10 stars. But didn’t max Elise specialty yet bc short the runestones.  Get the civ gears from wheel event. Now I got 3 civ gears. Two for archer. One for ground.  Refine.  Blazon. Beast seal are great for buff.  Active always is the key to be better. Practice ghosting and release the ghosting to defend.

Best I can recall they only go into a relatively long suspended animation a couple of times. When Red Dwarf is stolen at the end of S5 they take a 200-year nap while Kryten locates it.

""My character would know to have his sword drawn"" if you didn't declare it, no. However, it's genuinely possible that the player feels - actually, I quite often feel this way - that the cadence of the game is overwhelming and they're failing to come up with reactions to events as they happen, and it's diminishing their experience of the game. That's a bit of a bummer. I think it's possible to discuss this with the players, and or maybe self-reflect - DMing overlaps a little bit with public speaking, after all, and one of the most common issues with people's public speaking is letting the ideas fire off too fast.

""I would have brought a torch"" on its face, that one sounds reasonable to me. You mentioned blades in the dark and I just wanted to point out that the blades in the dark system is not simply ""you do a flashback establishing that you are right"" - bitd players choose a tier of loadout for each heist, so questions like ""do you have your halberd with you right now"" are resolved by what tier they chose.

"brasilivre","t5_351wl","Eu entendo seu posicionamento pragmático sobre a lógica do voto útil, mas realmente não vejo dessa forma. Nós sabemos que a maioria dos cidadãos não tem um nível de instrução bom e com senso crítico razoável. Como não possuem isso, eles votam com o estômago. Isso faz com que os candidatos mais bem colocados em pesquisa sejam sempre aqueles que: 

- Tem a máquina na mão.
- São politicos fisiológicos.
- Utilizam de demagogias e populismos baratos, sejam esses discursos baseados em discursos de ""paz"", ""alimentação"" (Lula, Boulos) ou em segurança (Bolsonaro), ou em sucesso pessoal financeiro (Marçal). Todos discursos emocionais.

Desse jeito, acaba sempre polarizando com esses tipos de pessoas medíocres, passando a ideia de que é só mais um teatro quando as coisas não são feitas. Nós presenciamos isso quando Bolsonaro se aliou ao centrão, acabou com a lava jato e por ai vai. Estou errado em ser firme e achar que é um teatro e que talvez nenhum dos dois seja bom o suficiente? É isso que todos nós percebemos quando vimos a farsa que era PSDB x PT. 

Comparar com a questão da Venezuela é uma falácia (generalização precipitada).

Sobre a Marina, ela precisa de votos dos bolsonaristas para ter uma relevância. Logo, ela precisa adotar os discursos deles, o que a torna um fantoche. Da mesma forma, vc sabe que o Boulos é fantoche do Lula. O problema não é só ser de esquerda, é tbm ser um fantoche de pessoas ou grupos, ao invés de focar em ideias e valores.

O Kim precisava declarar apoio a Nunes por uma questão de política interna dos partidos. Se ele não fizesse, isso prejudicaria a candidatura da Amanda e Renato. O grupo em si, MBL, não apoia o Nunes. A real é que eles odeiam o Nunes e o partido dele, pois minou a candidatura do Kim.",1727740910.0

So first things first, your dad did not help you with your education expenses. He got married when you were 18, did he spend the funds he had saved up for you, or just never save up?

>My dad (55M) remarried when I was 18, and I have a half-brother (17M)

>it would only be fair if I helped my brother since “family helps family.”

In the space of 17 years, he and his now-wife didn't save a penny for his son? This sounds like their issue, not yours. Is she his mom or stepmom? Changes her role, but makes me wonder if she had a hand in her somewhere.

NTA

He didn't give you any financial assistance, and isn't planning on giving your half-brother any help either. Making it your problem is absolutely not okay. You've got to work on supporting your own future.

>He got mad, called me selfish, and now both my stepmom and brother are giving me the cold shoulder.

They're all assholes. Your dad for trying to make this your burden, your step-mom for partaking in the madness (avoiding my conjecture) and your half-brother for believing he's entitled to your money.

There is (or was last time I checked) exceptions so first time buyers don't pay this on homes priced under $500k.     If you're a penny over that (and double check the limit) then you pay the full pull.   Sooooo definitely check into that sooner than later.

"facepalm","t5_2r5rp","Israel by and large is a very safe nation. However, so is Russia. The CEO likely did not move due to safety concerns, but moral grandstanding. 

However here's the rub - neither Russia nor Israel are countries that only recently invaded and occupied neighboring sovereign nations. Objecting to Russias current escalation with Ukraine, and then moving to Israel ... I mean, the latter has technically violated far more stipulations of the Geneva Convention in regards to war, so...

To put it more bluntly - Israel has overseen an apartheid regime longer than the Russian Federation (i.e., modern day Russia) has been a country. The notion that there was an absence of conflict until October 7th - or even for a long period - is horse shit. Israeli forces killed twice as many Palestinian civilians as Hamas on October 7th as recently as 2014, with the total number between the years of 2015 to 2022 also exceeding the number killed on October 7th. Of course after, so far the number is 40x. As for hostages, Israel routinely practices mass detentions in which civilians (i.e., not Hamas) are detained for an extended period of time without any charges ever being brought up. Individuals from these detentions have returned dead, or injured with obvious signs of torture. As for the number? Tens of thousands.

To say everything was peaceful before October 7th is bullshit. For Israel, everything is as peaceful today as it was before October 7th. If safety is your metric, you are fine. If instead you are trying to make an argument based on morality, bull.",1727740912.0

Nothing to research on an ongoing basis, nothing to DO, nothing to trade, nothing to compare against something else.

> Thanks to this large mirror, the instruments have high resolution, allowing the identification of objects as small as 6-10 cm in test performance. However, actual imaging, under good visibility conditions, is within 15-25 cm per pixel  


[https://innoter.com/en/articles/us-military-space-satellites/](https://innoter.com/en/articles/us-military-space-satellites/)

  
15 cm is also commonly stated for spy satelites, but we could assume that they might be somewhat better. 5 cm is a decent estimate that I see thrown around online as well.

We could probably calcualte the best case properties based on what we're currently capable of transporting into space, considering that we're mostly aware of the types of rockets that could be transporting the spy satelites, as well as their transport capabilities.

In general, the resolution is limited by the aperture/mirror size and what size can be transported into space, unless we do tricks like with the James Webb Telecope where we combine several mirrors - which comes with it's own set of complications.  
The next factor is the wavelength of the light - Infrared can be more easily detected than UV, because one bends more easily around corners than others.  
And finally the distance to the ground. But at some point here, we could replace the satelite in a 200km orbit with a plane flying at 30km high and could take similar or better photos.",1727740915.0

Alright. Now it's my turn to start glazing these DOM Trooper things with a nice essay or two.

What happened between the wars was the next-generation trial ZAFT mainstay grunt. 

In what was intended to be a level sided version of the Treaty of Versailles, each major superpower was restricted the number of mobile suits, proportional to their available resources and population. With the Coordinators being fewer than the Naturals, ZAFT was at a disadvantage. 

While the Earth Forces upgraded first to the modular Dagger Ls and Windams for most of their Striker Packs, the ZAFT forces had to choose between the prototype ZAKU, Gouf, and DOM. The Gouf was too limited to close range in spite of its inbuilt flight capabilities, and the prototype DOM, while having a belt-fed bazooka launcher and gimmicky drill lance, lost out the most.

That, and the fact that its Screaming Nimbus attack used Mirage Colloid particles, banned by the Treaty, especially for military applications. The ZAFT troops eventually settled for the modular ZAKU, minus the hip railguns and the N-Jammer Cancellers, with the GOUF later being assigned to elite pilots and commanders, leaving the DOM to be swiped by the Clyne faction.

Personally, it's tied with the Dreissen for the best looking DOM Trooper influenced machines. What it lacks in head design, a sleeker, angular design language on the shoulders and armor, and close range weapons (no forearm machine guns), it makes up for a simpler, more pragmatic loadout. No more silly rotor drones, either.

I honestly stopped giving a fuck about ""muh originality"" long, long ago. So long as it doesn't use the exact lineart (like the later Z'GOK), or at least makes some form of change over the original, I'm not going to make a huge ruckus over how it appears to be a lazy version that ... because every variation of the main grunt pays homage to the ZAKU, and every variation of the Gundam is ... well, a Gundam. Am I supposed to weep over how it doesn't stray from the formula? 

And what kind of change does it offer over the original, you might ask? Well, since it's in a universe where tech accelerates faster, it is simply offered better equipment (beam sabers vs. heat sabers, a bazooka and beam rifle combo, and most of all, A SHIELD). This sells the image of being a very good elite grunt-killer that can wipe out squadrons, but not enough against a high-level opponent in a Gundam, on paper, of course. 

What I'd take away from it is that the Screaming Nimbus as an *offensive* MS killing weapon is very silly. And the fact that they don't take advantage of its illegal technologies to put a NJC in its powerplant ... or even attach some sort of backpack to enhance its mobility suite or firepower. Okay, and Kunio Okawara's proportions and design language may make it look silly at times, but it is made up for when in animation.

It also bears the distinct honor to be the first successful instance of the Jet Stream Attack, uninterrupted.",1727740916.0

The TAPAS isn't about getting answers right or not, but gauging HOW you think, and there is a great mystery as to what they are looking for to qualify someone for linguist.  So it's probably a wash at best with taking the DLAB. 

On another note, you can probably get linguist in the other branches by just asking for it.  In the Air Force you typically need to make a list of ten or so jobs and the Air Force will match you with one, so no guarantee they match you with linguist even if you qualify for and put both (1N3 and 1A8) jobs on your list of 10.

"PublicFreakout","t5_2yrq6","The idea that Rabin's assassination is what prevented the peace is a myth. It's the other way around. Peace was already crumbling which is why he was assassinated.

Following Oslo I, the Palestinians opposing the peace process (among them Hamas, it's how their influence rose) started doing terrorism against Israel to sabotage the peace. Even the Hezbollah joined in. The terrorists were basing their operations from areas from which Israel had withdrawn according to the agreements of Oslo and were now controlled by Fatah. Arafat (leader of Fatah) refused to act against the terrorists at first because he wasn't really opposed to terrorism and also didn't want to have his authority challenged by going against them. As Israel withdrew from more and more areas, the terrorism not only increased but also began to affect Israel proper, while before it was mostly limited to occupied territories. This of course led to a large increase of the right which was opposed to the peace process. 

For instance, the 19 October 1994, a Hamas suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus in Tel Aviv, killing 21 and wounding 43. This led to a large number of protests by the right in Israel were Rabin was blamed for it and called a traitor. 

Eventually Rabin was assassinated by the right, yes, but it's Peres who took over, a man who was even more pacific than Rabin. Following the increasing popularity of the right, Peres was forced to call for elections to have a legitimate mandate to continue the peace process. During the campaign, terrorism only increased. It's only when Arafat realized the right might win that he decided to crack down on terrorism, but it was too little too late and they were too entrenched by that point for his actions to be efficient. Netanyahu won these elections because of the terrorism. 

If Rabin had not been assassinated, he would also have lost the elections and the result would be the same.",1727740916.0

We had nothing to do with any of that. We are beings caught in the crossfire of a war between Satan and God. Nothing about our existence is fair. To be born an angel is fair.

The other option would be someone closer to his age but usually by mid 30s they have a bit more baggage and already have children. May have gone through a divorce.  He can still have at least a child with this kind of woman but it can be tougher. The conditions have to be right.

This comment is NOT accusing you of copying anything. Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq#wiki_post_deletion) before [contacting the mod team](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole)***

Our family has been growing, and since last year, we started booking a holiday home in the countryside just before Christmas so we could all spend time together before celebrating separately with our own smaller families. Most of us live in small city apartments, so there's no space to host everyone. The house we rent is quite expensive but spacious, with a sauna, fireplace, and a chef's kitchen—perfect for a Christmas getaway. Each family also has their own room with an ensuite. 

This year, we booked the same house right after last year’s stay and made the down payment at the beginning of the year. In May, I informed my family that we (my husband, kids, and I) are moving overseas in September. My cousin and her partner, who are expecting a baby, also decided not to go. Her parents said they'd cover her share of the cost. 

Now, my sister is asking me to pay for my share, saying it's unfair for the rest of them to cover the extra cost. Dividing it among the others would only be about $15 more each, but my sister thinks it’s unfair for my cousin’s parents to pay for our share as well. 

I’m really torn. Should I just pay to keep the peace? I’m upset because this feels unfair, especially since we’re tight on money after the big move. It’s also been harder to communicate with my family now that we’re on the other side of the world, though in some ways, being distant from family drama can be a relief. I miss them all and want to do the right thing, but I can’t help feeling this isn’t fair.

Si me jefe me jode, me voy a desquitar metiéndome en la cola el tráfico. Si llego tarde y me descuentan el día, hago tercer carril. No se me respeta la hora de almuerzo, tiro basura en la calle. Zóquela papa. 


En temas comerciales, ante ""a cuanto lo menos"", ""regrese la otra semana por cheque"" y ""no me va a dar crédito?"" le sigue el ""solo efectivo"", recargo a pagos con tarjeta y las caras de tedio, actitud y lentitud. 


La clave ""capitalista"" para quien quiere armar un emprendedurismo es.... no venderle a salvadoreños. Es lo que las empresas *bien* hacen: alquilar y vender a extranjeros o adjuntos a extranjeros. El pueblo de a pie no tiene el dinero asi que equis con ellos (nosotros).


La salida patriota fuese tratar a proveedores y clientes con respeto y aprecio. Ser *calidá*, porque se atrae mas con miel que con hiel.

"REBubble","t5_3lflvh","That's about the historic growth rate of housing prices. Looks like reversion to the mean is actually reversion to the mean growth *rate,* not the mean home price pre-pandemic.   

I can't speak for Bill McBride, but if I were to guess, I would suspect that he expects marginal growth due to the still near record high unaffordability. Unfortunately homes can be grossly unaffordable to the median income earner and still go up because the median income earner is not the median buyer. The buying demographic is skewing older and richer. 

The ironic thing is, if there really was a giant dark hand pulling the strings for the ""you will buy nothing and be happy"" campaign, they would push these doomer narratives so that you'd hold off on buying. Those that didn't listen and bought came out way ahead. Those that have listened to doomer narratives got majorly screwed over. Those that will continue to listen will get left behind.",1727740918.0

"nonmonogamy","t5_2rc24","Sure. One was her first love from high school, who was also a good friend of mine. That relationship was on and off for more than thirty years (off when he was in a relationship and on when he was not in a relationship). We had the same hobbies and even traveled together. 

It was fun watching people looking at us interacting and asking about our relationship.

The second ex was her old boss. He turned out to be a great guy and we had a lot of fun until he developed health problems

The third ex she had was not a threesome experience, but a solo for her and him. I didn’t know him or even meet him until her drove her home around noon the next day. He was a classy gentleman that she really enjoyed reconnecting with after more than 30 years. 

Other than that we have had several MFMs with my good friends over the years. No regrets and we are still good friends with them.

Do not chase her or message her or call her if this is what she wants. You will push her further away. Give her more space than she asks for and go find a hobby or some activity that you would enjoy. If you haven’t been going to gym put that at the top of your list. This is the only way to get her back and that’s even if you have a chance at this point. It hurts I know, I’ve been there but no one told me what I’m telling you so I wasted time trying to get back and fix everything and it only pushed us apart. Ok now for the happy ending, we divorced after 18 years of marriage and 22 years total and after two years of time wasted I tied up my boots and got to work, gym, dance class (bachata) social events and about a year later I was glowing and happy and confident. I just hoped she was happy and I had the best years of my life being single for many years and traveling to finally meet a women that was on my level top to bottom.

unsolicited advice: try playing around with patterns and incorporating them into your outfits, but make sure to not overuse them too much. they just make an outfit a lot more coherent and it seperates the items from one another. also the stockings don't really match, they're lighter than the rest of the outfit, so they clash a lot. another suggestion is make hair combos and use bangs. you can equip a few hairs together and make a custom hairstyle, same with the bangs, they can totally change the whole vibe imo.

hope this help

If you are restricted to the A1 or X1C, I think you’ll find issues eventually with the exposed nature of the A1 and its bed slinging nature. The X1C will be a better quality option but if you need a lot of stuff printed quickly then having 6 A1s vs 2 X1C will get you there and be the only benefit of the A1 but it will come with problems eventually.

She's pretending like the border wasn't her responsibility when POTUS tasked his VP to look into it.  That's not the kind of leader I want, I want someone responsible.

That said, if you are going to get an oral piercing, chances are you are going to destroy your teeth, regardless of what kind of jewelry you use. I kind of want to redo my Medusa, but I’ve had all of my front teeth pulled already, so that’s not a worry for me.

"PersonalFinanceNZ","t5_38zrx","To start with, you're in a great position financially, unless you've got any debts you haven't declared you should have no issue getting finance. 

21.4% (ish) deposit means you'll also avoid the low equity interest rates the bank charge. My partner and I are making a $565k mortgage on low equity interest rates work reasonably comfortably on a combined income of roughly $140k and renting out a room to a couple we previously flatted with, so assuming you've got basic budgeting skills (and to save $150k I'm assuming you do!), you should have no issue sustaining a 550k mortgage on lower interest rates and higher income. I've also got a student loan but can't do much about this lol, works out to be about $400 a month, don't need to budget for it as such because it just gets taken out of your salary.

Re your mortgage advisor, just ask them anything you arne't sure about. When you're making this kind of financial commitment, there arne't any stupid questions. If you have a preference for which bank you take the mortgage out with discuss this with them, they'll go through all the options, and the little things that some banks offer and others don't. They also have a rough idea of what interest rates each bank is offering, what cashback they're offering etc etc. 

Same thing goes with your solicitor when you get to that stage (you'll want to look at engaging one so you're ready to make offers). For example, I was pretty confused about how we'd actually pay the deposit, then the mortgage etc, might sound like a stupid question but it made me anxious, asked them, got a great explanation, anxiety gone lol.",1727740920.0

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","Appreciate you not assuming and actually asking for clarification.  We were poly at the start.  We were long distance and I’ve actually had partners and encouraged her to have partners locally as well since we couldn’t physically be together.  This changed pretty much shortly after I moved in with her.   There were other factors involved in me leaving aside for wanting to be with her.  But it involved in me leaving my career and moving cross country. I made it abundantly clear that once I leave my career I can no longer go back. I can’t just go and ask for my job back it was the point of no return and I’ve been asking if this is what she wanted  for weeks leading up to that point. 

After it was all said and done and I made the move it was maybe a few months later I noticed jealousy and possessiveness start creeping in.  She flat out told me she became one of those girls that said they wanted poly and changed once they had me.  Seems like the moment the relationship got real she got that way. I couldn’t just leave and break it off because it would mean that everything I’ve sacrificed and left behind was for absolutely nothing which honestly at the time probably would have pushed me off the edge.

She wasn’t good at communicating at the time.  Emotional outbursts yelling slamming doors etc.  I’ve learned to just let her do those things then Reengage once the emotions calmed down. We managed to work through a lot of problems but the poly convo just kept the same reaction.  I haven’t tried to bring it up in years hoping I can stay mono and just make this work since I literally have nothing to go back to.  But fast forward to present. We are better at communicating even though she has emotional reactions depending on the topic. Aside from this one issue her and I are good and co parent well.  I’m just at the point myself where I can feel myself unraveling after years of trying to push this away.  So I was looking for ways or methods to maybe bring the convo back up and see if there’s a different reaction now.  Maybe her seeing how it’s affecting me will help her realize this isn’t some silly want or selfish desire.  Maybe people don’t understand that for some poly is a choice but for me it’s become abundantly clear that it is a very big need (guess I’m just wired that way). At this point the best case solution I’ve come up with was maybe just a strictly online relationship. She could know about it or it be a don’t ask don’t tell.  That way there’s literally nothing physical and it won’t be done around her and the kids.  But again can’t see if compromise is an option until the conversation is revisited.

And I will stress. Since some people think this is constantly being brought up.  This conversation happened like 2 times before I gave up and tried to make it work years ago. This isn’t beig forced for a change in answer.",1727740921.0

"beyondthebump","t5_2u06v","I have a degree in early childhood education and worked in schools and daycares for almost a decade. 

Any group daycare in my state has to be certified. So that means requiring CPR/first aid training, a certain number of continuing education hours every year for teachers, meals have to meet state nutrition requirements and age appropriate lesson plans have to be developed and posted. An inspector from the state visits regularly and documents any state licensing violations. Any violations also must be posted in a common area of the daycare. 

To my knowledge, pretty much every state in the US has similar requirements. Knowing there is a tremendous amount of oversight is reassuring to most parents… You really don’t have that with a nanny in your home. It’s just them and the baby so all you know is what they decide to share with you.

In this present structure, I would just earn my 30% commission and no other income from bonuses or downline commissions.

Just bad writing and bad CG. Why not write the story into a fistfight if that's what you need?

"elgato","t5_2rvyq","Thank you. I ended up being able to read the chart once I had already made the purchase. The only hardware limitations I currently have are my case. Ended up getting a Hyte Y70 touch and unfortunately the GPU is vertical blocking my other PCIE slots.

And it was definitely in an Elgato 4KX video. I have watched all of the Elgato (""Hi, I'm Steggy from Elgato) and Elgato workshop videos cause everything PC is new to me. Plus literally bought everything Elgato (SD mk2, SD+, Face Cam Pro, both mic arms, Dynamic XLR)

I know for sure I watched the videos on the 4KX. I am now noticing that on the ""How to Capture Playstation 5 with 4KX,"" when he hits record on the Lego game while the source is HDR, the capture says 1440p. 

But at the 1:58 mark of the video where it zooms in and highlights the capture, it clearly says 2160p60 while the source next to it sags the 2160p60 HDR so it was kind of misleading. 

I understand the hardware limitations of the card and my fault for not properly being able to understand the chart. But I couldn't find anywhere explaining that if I wanted to record at that settings that turning off the HDR setting on PS5/XBOX was the way to record at 4K60.

"labrats","t5_2srnv","Some additional figures had to be generated for the paper, but this required single-handedly implementing and optimizing a new and very expensive protocol that no one else in the lab had experience with. The previous postdoc on the project actually refused to do this himself before he left due to the time, labor, and cost of doing this. It took me a few months but I have just got the system up and running and now it will be a few more weeks before I am able to make the final figures for the paper if everything goes well. 

If anything goes wrong, there might not be enough time to finish generating the data and writing up the rest of the paper before grad school apps are due. 

I think I might have mentioned this earlier but actually one of the main reasons I want to apply this cycle is to get out of this job asap. I’m hoping rotating through labs in grad school and being able to talk more to PIs and lab members beyond the 2x 30 minute interviews I had for this job, will allow me to pick a much better culture and fit.

I applied to 17 schools and it was radio silence from 14/17 until november / December, when the mass rejections started pouring in. the way i tried to think of it was it was a brief period of time where i finally had nothing to do (no applications after work, no studying for the GRE, etc.) 

When I finally got the mass rejections and it hit me I wasn’t getting in my first cycle, I went to work in January. I signed up and studied for the GRE, I re-wrote my essays, I had my application reviewed. Now, in my second cycle, I’ve had more interviews than I did rejections last cycle. 

In the moment, it was very hard to survive the waiting period of August-November.

You're also forgetting that Jack was pretty hostile towards Walt and didn't have the best relationship, so even saying they had a ""good working relationship"" is wrong, it was purely transactional and Jack would've clipped Walt and just stole the money if he could.

How is he even supposed to be grateful anyway when he was only given 10 out of HIS 80 million dollars, the money he made for himself, the neo-nazis were already paid off and that was all his earnings, and THEY decided, nah lets give him only 12.5% of the money that he rightfully earned.

Mike, sure, completely unnecessary, but not Lydia considering how unpredictable she is because of her paranoia, if she had known that todd and jack's gang were killed who knows what she would've done, and also just tying up loose ends, so that Walt doesn't need to worry about it anymore, heck the whole point of their actions towards Walt was BECAUSE Lydia was expecting them to kill him, Walt just had his way, meaning she was already content on killing him to save herself, and that's why the neo-nazis and her needed to die in walt's eyes, that's why as a precaution, Walt had already poisoned her. Like lets say Walt lived in the end...Whats stopping lydia from hiding in her mansion place and killing him with men on her contacts, NOTHING

Same thing with Gus??? He threatened to kill his entire family if Walt tried to get in his way in him killing Hank, the fuck did you expect Walt to do, of course he's going to protect Hank. ESPECIALLY when he had already called the DEA to protect Hank's place from the ""cartels"", and his plan on escaping being botched because of the crawl space scene meant that Walt had very little time, it was only a matter of time until Gus finds out there's protection for Hank, meaning that the ultimatum was broken, so that meannnnss Walt and his family.

You started dating when they were identifying as female and now two years later they want to transition to male? Am I understanding correctly?

Not wanting to be with what would be another man doesn’t make you a transphobe as long as you are otherwise supportive of their decision to transition and you continue to treat them like a regular person. It seems pretty clear from the language you used in the post that you are in fact incredibly supportive of their choice, which is great. It’s just unfortunate that the gender they are transitioning to doesn’t align with your own orientation, and you aren’t a transphobe or bigot for gently pointing that out and wanting to go your separate ways.

NTA. But your boyfriend might be because while they want you to accept their gender orientation (and you do), they don’t seem to want to accept your sexual orientation.

Though thinking about it, maybe it’s because they have always seen themselves as male and maybe have convinced themselves or thought that you did too, so with the only thing changing really being their outward appearance they think you are rejecting them based solely on that?

"writingadvice","t5_30ow4","I'd have to know more about who the MC is as a character to be able to give a more thorough answer. For now, all I could suggest or propose is that the MC will need to adapt to his situation and this presents an opportunity to show how resourceful (or not) the MC really is in a crisis. That adds another layer to them as a whole.

Does he steal with impunity ""because I'm broke and you're rich""? Does he have a chip on his shoulder and steals with impunity because ""'The Man' has had it easy for 400 years so it's time I take some back!""? Or perhaps he doesn't steal with impunity -- perhaps he steals out of necessity and maybe leaves a little note saying, ""Sorry but my superhero suit got mangled and I didn't want to run around naked. IOU.""?

Maybe he doesn't steal at all.

Maybe he busks on a street corner in what rags he has left and earns some coin to buy more clothing? Or maybe saves someone who just so happens to be a tailor (I know, convenient right?) and as a thank you they offer to make a new outfit? Or maybe we see him, hat in hand (figuratively) at a thrift store or homeless shelter/YMCA type place where he can secure some new threads? Or maybe even rummaging through his former school's Lost & Found (he was a student at some time was he not?).

Or perhaps even confiding in someone his secret identity and in doing so, there's an opportunity to have one bought, made, or secured otherwise? Would be a good way to introduce the trust element into the story.

There are sooooo many ways that you can solve this puzzle.

You only need to determine which best suits your narrative, and which may also have a benefit of adding layers to the MC in the process.

Personally, if it were me, as my MC is 17 years old it's likely he's still in school or a dropout, but would still be known enough at his former school where he could appear and not draw so much attention as he rummages for clothing at the Lost & Found. Maybe make it so that he speaks to a classmate/bestie too and he opts to confide in them about what's happening, why they're there, and why they need to poke around the Lost & Found. I'd be looking for ways to add layers to my MC and that's one simple way to do it. Doesn't want to steal, doesn't want to beg, can't afford to buy -- so he has to use his smarts and determine where his best option for free clothing will be without drawing too much attention. What better place? Maybe have the local jock/bully make some comment about MC being so dirt poor that they have to go through Lost & Found but later in the story, MC saves their life and repeats back some glib comment that the jock/bully had said to them.

So many ways to skin this cat. Find the one that works best. Good luck.",1727740924.0

"ChristianDating","t5_2tqrp","Well, yes, we do know ""God's plan"" is a general sense, but we don't always know if he ""plans"" marriage or singleness for us, specifically. In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says it's OK to choose singleness and that it's OK to pursue marriage. He doesn't say God will make all these determinations for you.

We're also sometimes told that we have to be ""content"" before God will bless us with romantic love. This is a popular idea in modern church culture, but we're not required to be completely satisfied with life, whether we're married or single. We live in a bad world, where bad things happen and life doesn't always go our way. We don't have to repress our emotions or pretend that these situations make us happy. Nor do we have to pretend that these desires are unimportant to us. It's OK to feel and express sadness and loneliness. We're not going to disappoint God for feeling emotions that we can't control anyway.

Ideas like this imply that your ""season"" of singleness will end once we learn to properly exercise contentment. Apparently all the married couples somehow mastered this, and reached some pinnacle of contentment that God approved of and rewarded accordingly. As if we can use a formula and reverse psychology to convince God to give us the thing we want. Sometimes married couples will tell you that their story went like this, that God ""blessed"" them with a spouse once they stopped ""idolizing"" marriage, or once they ""stopped looking."" Cool story. As if that's some sort of universal rule. The Bible doesn't mention this weird idea anywhere.

Taking action to pursue these things doesn't make you desperate. It doesn't mean you're a bad Christian who doesn't ""trust God"" enough. Why shouldn't we work towards our goals? Don't we tell people that when it comes to other aspects of life? We're also told that ""Jesus is enough."" Often this is just a dismissive way of telling people that their desires, emotions, pain, frustration, loneliness, etc. doesn't matter. And it's often married people telling us this. Easy for them to say. No need to over-spiritualize things. When lonely singles are experiencing totally normal and unfulfilled desires for physical affection, how is Jesus going to practically meet that need, exactly?

It's OK to actively date, and to actively look for someone. I think there's a balance to strike here. Don't frantically search for a spouse, or approach it like your whole life depends on it. But don't feel like the ""good Christian thing to do"" is to passively wait for something to happen. Pray, of course, and look for godly characteristics in a partner. Some people might tell you to just ""wait on God's timing"" and a bunch of other clichés about ""soulmates"" and such, but the Bible doesn't mention anything about soulmates; that idea comes from Greek philosophy and mythology. The Bible also says it's OK to pursue marriage (1 Corinthians 7)",1727740925.0

I have a tablet in my car set up so that I can watch her live on Skype, and on the few instances where I have to leave her at home, I have cameras around the house so that I can check to see if she had a seizure while I was gone.

Quello che mi fa strano a leggere quello che scrivi (anche se in realtà è una situazione molto comune per ambo i generi) è che ne sei stupita. Non si può avere la botte piena e la moglie ubriaca, semplicemente, siamo esseri finiti e abbiamo una data di scadenza.

Lo otro es que cómo defines las razas en humanos, porque ahorita estamos culturalmente dominados por la definición gringa de blanco y POC.

Sin embargo, no es lo mismo un eslavo que un vasco o un irlandés, tan solo por mencionar tres personas de ""raza blanca"" que, hace también unos años, se considerarían entre ellos de diferente raza.

Lo mismo en la ""raza negra"", son un montón de culturas con pueblos genéticamente diversos, pues África es un continente masivo lo que permitió grupos humanos se aislaran geográfica y culturalmente entre ellos.

Igual para los asiáticos: hay weros de ojo azul en medio oriente y Rusia, morenos en gran parte de la India y la gente de Asia Oriental (que es lo que mucha gente en América denomina asiático)

Así que yo sí acepto que hay razas humanas, pero usando la definición vieja, que es la misma que usamos para las razas de perros, caballos o gatos, pese a que solo hay una especie humana, una especie de perro, una de caballo y otra de gatos.

"news","t5_2qh3l","> ATLANTA (AP) — A Georgia judge on Monday struck down the state’s abortion law, which took effect in 2022 and effectively prohibited abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy.
> 
> Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney wrote in his order that the law violates Georgia’s Constitution, finding that “liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.”
> 
> When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion, it opened the door for state bans. Thirteen states now bar abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions. Georgia was one of four where bans begin after about the first six weeks of pregnancy — often before women realize they’re pregnant.
> 
> McBurney’s ruling would allow abortions through at least 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Georgia’s Supreme Court will likely overturn this on appeal, but I applaud this judge for seeing the legitimacy of women having reproductive freedom and control over their own bodies.

I do believe there are some conservative perspectives and leaders that have merit or at least a place in the conversation, even if I disagree with them.

The point I am trying to make is that MAGA is not conservative. It is a radical, reactionary, personality cult that rejects many traditional conservative ideas. Trump is the ultimate RINO, while many traditional long standing Republicans are now called RINOs. In the US, MAGA was created and enabled by cynical conservatives that have poisoned the well for generations and now deservedly find themselves in a ‘Leopards ate my Face’ situation.

And why should the team's record from the year before have any weight on it? The teams change year to year. It's not like the NFL where a team will largely stay the same.

"AO3","t5_3c2cn","First of all, I just want to clarify that you did nothing wrong if they asked for critique and you gave them constructive feedback. But personally, I've learned to be very selective who I give con crit to because I've been burned so many times. I used to post on a site called The Next Big Writer, which was EXPLICITLY a critique site, and the number of times I got hostile responses to my mild and generally positive reviews was really eye-opening. Some people really just want validation, no matter what they might say.

I remember one writer who was actually very good, wrote lovely prose, and I'd left glowing reviews on several of their chapters. But then I made the mistake of telling them that I didn't understand one of their metaphors. It was very cerebral and abstract, and I just didn't get it. They said that my comment  had them ""awake all night"" reevaluating their writing style. I hastened to explain that there was nothing wrong with their writing style; I just thought there was room to refine it a bit. But the damage was done. The next thing I knew, I had a wall of text under one of my chapters, saying that all of my characters were caricatures, and they didn't care about them at all--and it was my JOB as a writer to MAKE them care. It was also a fantasy novel and they admitted that they don't read or like fantasy. Then went on to make some snide remark about how  ""you seem to have quite a little fan club here, and I honestly don't understand what people see in your writing."" 

(Yes, I save all of my bad reviews, because I'm motivated by spite.) 

So yeah, I don't solicit feedback from strangers any more, nor do I give feedback. 

As for what would make me stop reading an author entirely, I haven't run across anyone (yet) on A03 that I would feel the need to mute entirely. The one thing I can think of that would definitely turn me off though is if I got fundie vibes from the writing. A dead giveaway is if the story involves an unplanned pregnancy that is dangerous to the mother or is going to completely turn her life on its end, and the possibility of abortion isn't even brought up for discussion.",1727740929.0

Women could not open a credit card account in their own name, nor could they build individual credit histories.

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","I think the fact that you are open with your son will make the conversation a little easier, even if just to talk about the death of a student he knows in passing from school. I have a son who has been through similar scenarios with students in the same school that have been killed, as well as more directly known. Unfortunately, deaths occur and are never easy for those left to try to piece everything together.
Personally, I agree with others who have stated unless you're 100% certain the cause of death, do not indicate any cause as this could just lead to rumors and potentially more hurt for the family and friends dealing with the loss. 
The best thing you can do is be there for your son and if he has any questions, then be there to talk and help him through.  
In addition to that, it is never too early to have those discussions about safe sex practices. Depending on your beliefs, discuss masturbation and honestly answer any questions your son might have. It may be uncomfortable now but better than not having it and missing out on the opportunity altogether.
Ultimately, I don't think anyone here can tell you how to have that type of conversation but only those difficult conversations are part of parenting and need to be had in an attempt to keep our kids safe. This is a scary world and kids have way more access to things that could pose a threat than we ever did at their age.",1727740929.0

There’s a huge difference between these different cultivars as far as how much light and nutes they can handle.

"hajimenoippo","t5_2tru3","And in Ippos case so far he's fought bigger guys than him and almost every match the favor was against him but still manages to win. If competitions what you're looking for then Ippo won against Jason Ozuma who has the same power as Takamura who is a natural heavyweight but faster in terms of hook speed than Takamura. Mashiba whos reach is longer than a 6 foot 1 Takamura. Saeki who was at a certain point, was the fastest in the series. Volg Zangief a world amateur champion whos made numerous boxers retire. Takeshi Sendo and Sawamura who was once a delinquent and often engages in street fight before becoming a boxer. Plus any other boxers who's of different Caliber. In terms of power, Ippo easily takes the cake, defense and endurance? we've seen Ippo take hits really well against power punchers, endure it, knocked down and still got up. He is also a good dodger. Now im not gonna even mention how many times in the series numerous characters mentioned that Ippo has an infinite amount of Stamina due to his work ethic (Kamogawa and Date mentioned this). In terms of speed, Ippo's step in is hellishly fast as well. Comparing there physique Ippo takes the cake, just look at Ippos mountain of a muscle due to murderous training compared to Mikeys physique. Now Mikey uses a lot of kicks but I doubt any of that would have a clean hit on Ippo. As youve seen in the series, Ippos fighting style involves a very close range fight and I am confident that he can easily close the gap between him and Mikey inside an MMA cage or whatsoever. Also at very close range, Mikeys kicks would be rendered useless. Also, at very closes range weve seen Ippo dodged numerous punches who is faster, and has smaller motion compared to a kick which Ippo can just dodged if he saw that coming. I'd say the only way Mikey wins against Ippo is that Ippo wouldnt dare to hurt someone outside of boxing proper.",1727740930.0

This is exactly a definition in regard to intent. Intent matters a lot, even in what type of crime someone would be charged with.  You have to talk about intent when talking about selfish behavior. 

You ignore my original reason for bringing up the word selfish to describe a person choosing their happiness over another which is selfish and wrong. Then you say, selfishness doesn't have to be ""always negative."" So I misused the word? When it align exactly with the definition? 

Is someone selfish when they eat? No

Is someone selfish when they take someone else's food and then eat it? Yes

Is eating a negative action? If you eat too much, yes it is. If it harms yourself or another, yes. There are many nuances. 

So back to the original point. Was I wrong to say that someone is selfish because they are choosing their own ""happiness"" over another person?",1727740931.0

"Ratschlag","t5_4cv0iv","Bei mir war es erst so mit 15 oder 16, aber dann oft auch jedes Wochenende in der coolen Jugendlichen-Kneipe in der Stadt am Bahnhof (wohnten auf dem Dorf). 16. Geburtstag vom großen Bruder eine angebrochene Flasche schrecklich schmeckenden Whisky bekommen. Später wegen Big Lebowsky war White Russian cool.
Zwischendrin aber auch ganz normale Abende mit Freunden wo wir bei jemandem zu Hause saßen, Tee getrunken und Brettspiele gespielt haben.

Dann Studium, Ersti-Woche direkt ganz viel Bier.

Dann anderer Studienort, das Hobby mit den Spieleabenden weitergeführt, nur dass meine Kommilitonen den Tee schon komplett gegen Bier getauscht hatten.

Irgendwann Abschluss, zu Hause, mit Leuten was spielen, die sich vernünftig und erwachsen halt ein oder zwei Biere an dem Abend gönnen. Oh, we're doing alcohol again? Nächstes Mal mit (natürlich wegen dem Känguru) Schnapspralinen und irgendeine Flasche Hochprozentiges mir mitgenommen. Das war der vorletzte Absturz.

Dann endlich Job gefunden, neue Stadt, niemanden kennen, Kollegen erst so langsam wieder aus Corona-Homeoffice heraus, total einsam. Feierabend-Biere, -Weine, -Whisky-Cola-Dosen. Daneben ein bisschen Selbstenfindung. Eine Bar aufgesucht. Der letzte Vollrausch. Mittwoch nicht zur Arbeit erschienen. Donnerstag wieder da, direkt ernstes Gespräch mit der Vorgesetzten. Es muss sich (nochmal) etwas ändern in meinem Leben.

Mir persönlich hat dann Hypnose geholfen (Selbsthypnose durch Videos auf YouTube). Kann für dich vielleicht was anderes sein. Vielleicht irgendwelche Treffen oder Klinik, wenn du ganz aufhören willst und es alleine nicht schaffst.

Seit 2 Jahren trocken.

Mir hatte es übrigens geholfen, das Wort ""Quartalssäufer"" zu lernen. Wenn man also eigentlich nicht jede Woche oder auch nicht jeden Tag in der Woche trinkt, aber dafür alle paar Monate ganz viel. Hatte das Wort auf Reddit irgendwo gelesen.

Bei dir ist es vielleicht etwas anderes als bei mir, aber es klingt auch so ein bisschen nach Alkoholiker. Was tun? Ganz aufhören (mit einer wirksamen Methode). Ist auch gesünder. Und daneben ein neues Leben mit neuen Hobbys aufbauen, die möglichst sehr viel weniger kompatibel mit Alkohol sind.

Und wenn dich das Dorfleben trist und depressiv macht, in eine größere Stadt ziehen. Und wenn du aus anderen Gründen vielleicht deine Flucht im Alkohol suchst, vielleicht ein bisschen auf die Suche nach dir selbst gehen.",1727740931.0

"SpaceBuckets","t5_2v4n2","You have to create a lung in your space to allow the plant to grow properly.  Having an air pump inside or outside of your growspace is how this is achieved.  Yes they make noise, like a desk fan.  You can have the device outside of the bucket with the filter at the end if you set it to suck.  Mine is set to blow, because i keep it in a tent.

Temps, you'll need to get a space heater that's cost efficient and won't burn your house or plants down due to heat stress or lack of humidity.  There's heat mats...

Your yield will vary based on the strain and the height of your bucket configuration.  Look at the high end yields for seeds as someone who's assumed to be supercropping, topping, etc...  You won't really do a lot of that with your configuration, so dial back your expectations.  I think my first plant was 4oz, my first properly trained one was like 4oz, but a much higher quality flower.  If you can break even on your cost in like 2-3 cycles for your investment then it's worth it.  Don't sweat it.

Additional advice...  Grow medium...  I would go with coco and perlite.  Soil can be tricky and until you're brave enough to try, going with coco and perlite will help set good daily habits for watering, nutrition, lighting, et al that will help later on.

Think of it like a Karate Kid situation where it will seem really menial to do it daily, but you get really good at it by the 4-5 cycle...",1727740931.0

He can take off his mask when he’s with Suzune? No, I don’t think so. Rather, this is what it says in the LN:

“Since this was Karuizawa, I could tell the truth and save myself trouble in the future.

‘Bear in mind that Horikita from our class and the former student council president are sib-lings.’

‘I figured as much. That reminds me... during the relay race, you and the student council pres-no, I guess the former student council president-you two started together. Do you know each other, Kiyotaka?’

‘Yeah. Through his little sister.
That’s why he notices me.’

“**So, he knows who you are
beneath the mask?’ asked Karuizawa.**
‘**Beneath the mask, huh? No. He only knows what’s on the surface. No one else at this school knows me as deeply as you do**,’I said”

"metroidvania","t5_2tvxq","I actually played some Metroidvanias last week!

I played Exographer for a bit, it was one I was super excited for, and while it's pretty clever, it was a bit of a let down. It felt too much like I was just following steps in a checklist. You go to an area, you see unique things and take a picture, and you go into the menu and the picture will have text with what you need to do written in yellow.

Sometimes you'll need to ""analyze"" the picture which is just a simple matching game. 

Ultimately it's an _incredible_ design hamstringed by a poor implementation. What they should have done is go fully textless. None of the pictures should have had instruction text and nothing should have been tutoriailzed. This would have turned it into a game of discovery where you use the visual clues to work out yourself how things go together.

I get why they went the way they did, they wanted accessibility and ease of play for sales, but... looking at the amount of reviews they have, I don't think it worked. Had they gone full metroidbrainia, we'd have a new La Mulana style cult classic on our hands. But they didn't, and now we just got yet another indie MV that'll end up 10 pages deep in the Steam tag. It's a bummer because this _exact same game as-is_ could have been one of this sub's hidden classics had they just trusted the player without all the guidance and hand-holding. It was a gamble, and they chose wrong.

After putting that down, I picked up Erza's Wheel of Fortune and that's been good fun. I love me some trashy ecchi anime schlock and when combined with a solid Igavania formula, it's a fun time.

Other than that I've been playing some various shmups, specifically Terra Feminarum which is one of the best shmups I've played and at only 60 Steam reviews it's _criminally_ unknown.",1727740932.0

"peloton","t5_2suzs","Agreed with the other comment, but also to add, Remco nor MVDP were able to completely gap everyone else with their attacks - if they relay full-force together, they still have a dozen guys on their wheel who will then be much fresher. Maybe if Remco & MVDP could get away as a duo they’d relay, but it’s always harder to cooperate in a larger group & the other riders will both expect the 2 of them to do the brunt of the work as the automatically presumed strongest, and mark all of their attacks more than any other, while Remco/MVDP weren’t *that* much stronger than the others in the final group enough to drop them on the Zurich parcours. It’s an interesting paradox that they’re too talented for their own good, in that they’re the couple of riders who should hypothetically be able to pull back Tadej, but their presence in a larger G2 makes it even less likely that this will happen.

If Remco and MVDP say fuck it we need to bring back Tadej no matter what, and work together as the strongest while letting everyone else sit on, then they are at a massive disadvantage to not just Tadej but all the other top riders, especially with sooo many km left in the race. It only makes sense to cooperate if everybody does an equal amount of work, but that is almost just fantasy. And even strong small groups that split off the front group for brief periods of time never made too many inroads on the gap (excluding that brief moment of hopium when Tadej slowed down a bit), so I feel like they would have all sacrificed a ton of energy to get Tadej back before he just rides them off his wheel on the final climb. I guess that’s a hypothetical we don’t know, what state Tadej would be in if he was caught/if he had enough energy to just attack again, but my gut feeling is yes 😅

I get frustrated at G2 also, but the race dynamics here were so absolutely perfect for G2 syndrome in every way that I can’t even be too mad at the riders after thinking about it endlessly, it just makes too much sense. Anybody else attacking 100km out would indeed be suicide and you could bet on them bonking, but now they know they can’t rely on that assumption for Tadej’s next long-range attack, I guess.

That's the link that I provided four posts ago. The post that you replied to claiming that he had the story taken down.

It's pretty obvious what happened here -- ben Sulayem gave an interview to *Autosport* that was intended to be an exclusive. However, *Autosport* and motorsport.com are owned by the same publisher and share a lot of staff, so it was posted to motorsport.com first. They realised the mistake and took it down from motorsport.com, reposting it to *Autosport* where it was intended to be all along and has been available ever since.

Instead, you have come up with this utter bullshit theory that ben Sulayem had the story pulled to avoid public scrutiny. You have absolutely zero evidence to support this claim. It's also complete nonsense because the story has always been available on *Autosport*.

This discussion thread was started because ben Sulayem has since made further public comments about how the FIA ""only gets rubbish"". And you know what? I can't say that I disagree with him, given what you just claimed. If ever the media pressed him on how the FIA gets unfairly criticised, you could could -- and should -- be Exhibit A.",1727740932.0

"Adulting","t5_394gd","Your teeth are great and you have a nice, open, genuine smile. Your face is unique and pretty. 
I watch a fair amount of reality tv and something I noticed recently is how everyone has the same weird teeth on these shows… those huge white fake teeth are very uncanny valley to me. 
Also, I think that many Hollywood stars (we’re talking about people with all the resources to get the best veneers in the market) actually worsened their image and looks by getting veneers… the prime example would be Miley Cyrus, she’s still beyond stunning, but she definitely has veneers blindness and you can tell that her current teeth are so big she can barely talk normally. She is still so gorgeous and her face is to die for, but those veneers definitely did nothing to improve her image at all. There was no need to change her existing smile.
This is a long winded way to say that perhaps your smile isn’t picture perfect (I genuinely struggle in finding any flaws), but it’s a lovely smile that does NOT distract from your beauty, if something it enhances it. Your face has a lot of character and it is expressive and luminous. Why would you mess with that, on top of paying a hefty tax to change something that’s already great?",1727740933.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Where do I start? My parents have always been there for me no matter what. We always had a roof over our heads, plenty of food, and they kept negativity/drama away from me and my brother. My mom made herself very approachable if something was wrong. She answered any questions I had (even embarrassing ones). We often talked about boys and had a lot of shared interests in books/movies. My dad has always been a man of few words, but shows his love through actions. He's the type to always make sure we had everything we needed, anything from making sure we had gas in the car, or food in our stomach. He especially liked getting us snacks and treats.

My parents took us to Disneyland often during our childhood, and other fun vacations. They helped support us in school. They allowed me to stay with them rent free until I was 25 and able to move out on my own. Those last couple of years they let my fiance stay with us (he had moved from out of state right when the pandemic started). He also didn't have to pay rent as long as we were either going to school or had a job and helped out around the house. They've been very welcoming of my husband from the beginning (including the rest of my family). They didn't want him to pay rent because he needed to save up for a car. They even helped him find a car when the time came, and since then he's had the most reliable car he's ever owned. During that time I was able to get my BA degree. Those two pushes have helped us out tremendously with getting a good head start in our adult lives, and we feel incredibly fortunate for it.

The second spot I went to i ran across a trick and basically when she walked by my car I called her over (I had brought along a stem and some hard and basically we just started passing the pipe and I elaborated on what a kid like me was doing on that side of town and she understood completely.. She pulled out her own pipe and hard and we got higher.. She asks me what I was looking for I listed off H , hard, and benzos.. I had money for this little excursion of mine and handed her 50$.. She walks right up into one of the houses we were parked by and comes directly back to me. I procured a decent quantity of black and some more of the crack.. She then had me pull up a few blocks away to this abandoned looking house and we smoked and got all cracked out for an hour or two.. The quality of the black was surprisingly good though especially for being a cold cop.. (Not a meth story exactly but still shows you that a prostitute will know where to find something and if you aren’t a weirdo and have some  communication  skills you’ll probably end up having a wild time) And if not, you’ll likely get shot, robbed, or arrested.

"LinkinPark","t5_2s47y",">I was pretty mind blown when I thought of it, because the vagueness of the new artwork was starting to bother me especially since I know how intentional the band is when it comes to their art design from just watching them explain the process behind choosing past artwork on LPTV.

Yeah, there's a lot going on with several aesthetic aspects of the album and current tour.   
  
For instance, the new logo is not only a more organic shape, but also the result of something like blurring and refocusing - not only loses the sharp corners, but also the close lines got fused together. It's a circle, a zero, but also an infinite shape with no beginning and no end.

The show has several transitions: Inception | Creation | Empty Spaces | Break/Collapse | Kintsugi | Resolution. Plays heavily with broken and fragmented imagery - like a piece of art, like a statue or a vase going all the way from idea to object, being broken and mended again, anew. One of the transitions even has lasers shooting onto the screens fusing cracks as it goes.

Kintsugi is the japanese art of repairing ceramics with precious metals. The philosophy is that instead of hiding the repair, it highlights it - the damage is part of the history. In embracing that damage, it becomes more, a new object beautiful in its own way

It's a whole album about a transformations. A new beginning borne out of a traumatic transition. It's about embracing that damage and making it history, not erasing the past, but highlighting it.

>\*SIDENOTE: I actually really appreciate your post especially after our first discussion on the sub regarding Em's voice, and I'm pretty glad to have a mature conservation on here amidst the trolling/hate controversies of reddit and this sub. Additionally I love the message of your DP which reminds me to humble myself, I feel like we could be really good friends, so I just wanna thank you mate. It's a pleasure to share this virtual space with you.\*

Thanks, I appreciate that. In general, I think we should always assume the best of people, so that's how I try to approach things. Empathy is not a trait or a state, empathy is a practice. We need to consciously, intentionally practice empathy. I'm not always the best at that, but I try.

I think we can have much more productive conversations if we assume most things aren't done out of malice. People ignore things, make mistakes, misjudge. We all human and the benefit of the doubt more often than not has a negligible cost. Disagreements of opinions will happen and if they stay in the realm of harmless things, I think we can live with that.

>I just wanna note that I coincidentally am curious about getting into creative direction because I love art, but only have a background in architecture, and have been unemployed for over a year. So if you have any industry leads or anything to impart I would love to learn more.

Background in architecture might actually be something meaningful. I'm a creative director in advertising - studied comms/advertising with emphasis in art direction, so that was my path; from Designer to Art Director to Creative Director. But one of the ADs under me actually studied architecture, got into advertising through event production where they developed and designed the concepts for sets and stages. I actually worked with him when he was still doing that work.

As UncleGurm said, getting two **Coway Airmega 300** or **400** units on sale would be great.  Two of these units would give you a higher combined CADRs than one large premium unit.  The **Coway Airmega 300** is currently $359 on Coway's website.

Most companies operating in this space is focused on ""The Middle Mile"", from freeway on-ramp to off-ramp.  Most are also focused on pre-mapped and trained routes.  These vehicles only operate well in reasonable weather conditions (light rain) and are targeted at regions like Texas (FW to Dallas) or Arizona.  We won't see these trucks doing really-long haul, or crossing mountain ranges for a long time.

Even better, there's no concern in trucking on Self-Driving taking over jobs because there's a huge driver deficit in trucking.  Self-Driving still needs operators to move first and last mile and to take over driving the truck when something unexpected happens (tele-operation).",1727740934.0

Before joining the Orthodox church I was told to pray with my eyes closed and focus on feelings. I had a lot of experiences where I had to admit it was just emotion and imagination and voice in my head that was a lier and what I wish to happen.

  
Now that I'm Orthodox that voice has ceased now that I keep my eyes open, look at icons and read from a prayer book. I believe that that now I can only ask God for mercy and compassion and He is always willing to give that. I don't know that I ""feel God's presence"" but more of a quiet confidence I'm on the right track. I'm just thankful that the imagination voice in my head has finally stopped which is a blessing.

You are grossly misrepresenting what happened. I am not discussing the original claim. I am calling out the false information you are presenting. The escalator for Marin was six percent per year; Harper scrapped that entirely and tied it to nominal GDP. 

>It was cut when Trudeau was elected.

Trudeau increased funding almost immediately upon being elected PM in 2015.

>Of course nuance matters. What doesn’t matter are fake analogies. Yes, if anyone said they’d want to wipe out all Iranians then obviously they are not advocating for killing all Muslims. That would be nonsensical. There are approximately 2 billion Muslims in the world while Iran’s population is 88 million. Obviously that is stupid. 

So to you a genocide only matters on % of the global population. Fascinatingly morally bankrupt ideology you got there.

No I'm not you fucking liar. How hard is it to not lie all the fucking time?

I think AMEX officially says that payments will post within 15 minutes, but if you don’t see it right away, you’ll almost always see it by the time you refresh the page. Other than AMEX, there’s not many issuers that will have the payment reflect in your balance so quickly. I’ve noticed some Synchrony Bank and Capital One cards do the same, but can’t think of any others off the top of my head right now.

The point is that this particular warning is usually given to new accounts within the first year of opening that AMEX has not yet built enough of a relationship with to best understand their spending and payment habits. So, an algorithm simply keeps the balance from going too high and that number will change frequently just like one’s PoT could give you vastly different approvals just 24 hours apart. The moment a payment is applied to the account, it should fall below this threshold and you likely won’t see it again for a while. 

Therefore, my recommendation is to always pay-in-full, especially when receiving such a message; or better yet, just proactively pay-in-full every week or two to keep the account balance low. After 12 or 13 months, such warnings will become few and far between.",1727740936.0

I suppose there are more open areas of the Scarlet Forest, but I don't think there's enough to justify Namielle visiting them. Not yet anyways.

This is why I think the DLC will be far more likely to contain Namielle. If the DLC contains more underwater environments and expansions to existing locales, Namielle would have plenty of places to fight. And *then* the Scarlet Forest would be the perfect place.",1727740936.0

If I had not left a functional and loving but boring long-term relationship in my late 20s to have other experiences, I would have missed out on so much; it would have been a major loss, and my life would be substantially less rich now. I decided that a relationship was of secondary importance to me, and that was the right decision. I am concerned that many of the comments telling you with certainty that you'll regret it are only projecting their own anxieties and fears - they cannot possibly know that about you. One thing that might help is a book called Too Good to Leave, Too Bad to Stay by Mira Kirschenbaum, who is an experienced relationship therapist. The book is intended to be a practical guide to making up your mind, with a series of yes/no questions. Having said that, I am not sure it would be entirely appropriate to your situation, because many of the questions assume some relationship dysfunction. Still, it might be worth looking at to see if it offers you anything.",1727740936.0

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a transaction has been completed, one user (buyer or seller) must create a comment (can be in-line with the deal discussion) tagging both `DCSbot` and the user they transacted with, for example  u\/DeadAlive92.
 * The u/ is required, and the username for the bot ***MUST BE TYPED NOT COPY/PASTED*** to work properly.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential transaction must be made via comments. Exchange codes/payment via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted buyers and sellers.  **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

I play guitar and sing, badly, but it’s given me such a huge appreciation for how songs are structured, how recordings are arranged, and the incomprehensibly high level of musicianship on most recordings. Pick up a guitar or some keyboards and learn some easy songs, it might rekindle the fire.

Peter Wispelwey’s Bach Cello Suites are amazing.

I’ve always loved Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A Major.

I like bluegrass, but usually in small doses, but I can listen to Doc Watson all day.

Arvo Pärt.

And yes they are allowed to park there. The side walk is literally wider in front of the boathouse for the purpose of unloading boats. But heaven forbid its actually done. The whole idea of having boats unloaded on the side walk is to avoid cars swerving around stopped cars on the road. Which causes accidents. And as we saw with the latest accident, when cars swerve they can end up on the sidewalk. If there is no obstruction on the road and bikes and pedestrians can move safely why is there an issue? The sidewalk is wide for this purpose. 

And to the point of oh carry the boats several blocks. Some of the boats are the lengths of buses. If people are carrying them on the normal width sidewalk that is more hazardous. Not to mention it’s extremely difficult to cross the road safely with them.",1727740938.0

The tubing is garbage; toss it and buy new. It's cheap.

Any ball lock (or pin lock if the kegs are pin lock) is also trash. Safer to buy new than cleaning 20+ year old quick disconnects. Good quality CMB QDs are $6 retail.

Regulators can be pricy, so if these work it'd save you money right there.

Tower may or may not be usable, but if it is, it could be cool to haver a copper tower. Same with the faucets. 

The kegs can be refurbished with minimal effort if they're clean inside. If not, cleaning shouldn't be too much effort. Definitely buy some seal kits for them though.

Can't speak to fridge/chiller, but with the parts above, you're getting a decent deal. If whatever that blue box is works, and you need it, that's even more value.

Good luck with getting this!",1727740938.0

"horizon","t5_2s5h5","I'm skeptical the Tenakth would have been able to push anywhere close to Meridian. They had breached the walls at Barren Light, true, so would have captured the entire Daunt. But then they have to scale the mountains, and cross all of the terrain we see Aloy cross during the prologue. That's desolate Carja territory seemingly far removed from the Tenakth homeland. When the Carja invaded the West they had the Daunt as a convenient fortified staging area, and plundered the Utaru for supplies. The Tenakth would have had to live as an army by subsistence on the march, which they'd be capable of. Then, they'd reach Sunfall - a Carja Fortress designed specifically to defend the Sundom from the West. Even if the Carja were in Civil War by this point, the Shadow Carja would have fought to the Death against either Regalla or Hekarro.


Only after toppling Sunfall could they enter the Sundom proper, and faced the main Carja army that would have retreated from Nora and Banuk lands to defend Meridian. Avad's liberation is often described as a coup by the Shadow Carja, and I don't think that's hyperbole alone. They had sympathetic insiders, as well as the Oseraam canons. They would have had a much easier job capturing Meridian than the Tenakth, especially consider Blameless Marad is implied to have 'served [Jiran] to his enemies' thus enabling Ersa and Avad's triumph. Jiran had ordered Helis to flee to Sunfall with his followers rather than fight to the death during the Liberation, which was another contributing factor.


I can't see the Tenakth winning unless they attacked right at the peak of the Carja Civil War, and that's still a huge doubt. Jiran's Carja, or Avad's Carja post HZD having reunified with the Shadow Carja lands, would be too tough under the geographic context.",1727740940.0

Can anyone vouch for the standards of this particular zoo that Moo Deng is in? The Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Thailand. Are these animals like Moo Deng having a good quality of life there? Do they really care about the animals or is it more about making money?

I just hope that by engaging with the virality of Moo Deng we are not turning her into a cash cow ripe for mistreatment especially.

Not to suck the joy out of it, the pics and vids are super cute and funny, but I think it’s worth asking these questions with regards zoos when many who are less mindful about animal welfare simply will not ask.",1727740940.0

"psychologyofsex","t5_2tjh0","To build on your point about people not choosing this path at 18, I have a college education and worked in healthcare for six years before I became a sex worker. After being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease and pre-melanoma cells that needed removal, I found it challenging to work full-time. However, I needed to maintain my healthcare coverage to afford my treatment, which still required thousands of dollars out-of-pocket, even with insurance.

Having always been sexually open, I made the conscious decision to start sex work to fund my medical treatment while also allowing myself the flexibility to spend time with friends and family. 

Do you think someone like me should have to hear accusations of self-abuse when I made a deliberate choice to pursue sex work to help save my life? There are many others like me with similar stories and the things you’re saying perpetuate stigma around sex workers, making life even harder for us and for trafficking victims.",1727740940.0

"Photobooks","t5_2x7ue","I spent the last week traveling through coastal Maine and visiting various bookstores along the way. Here's what I lugged home with me.

Clockwise from top-left:

Photography: An Opinionated Guide (Robert Shore)

Istanbul (Alex Webb)

For Now (William Eggleston)

Driftless: Photographs From Iowa (Danny Wilcox Frazier)

Near Home (Robert Mitchell)

Machigonne #3 (Nicholas Gervin)

Dark City (Lynn Saville)

Aperture 162 (Sally Mann, Nick Waplington, Richard Misrach)

National Press Photographer's Association Best-of 2001 Yearbook

Meditations (Susan Meiselas)

My luckiest find was the Webb, which I got for $4 at the Camden Public Library booksale. Also a special shout-out to Craig Olson in Belfast, who operates a beautiful little store with a very nicely-curated collection of Photobooks and other rare items. It took all my willpower not to empty my entire bank account.

Here is a better question. How many times have you personally seen this symbol connected to anything OTHER THAN normal art? How many times have you seen it connected directly to a secret pedophile lair? How many of Epstein’s documents have this symbol on them?

"nursing","t5_2ra72","I walked into a shift on Christmas Day morning one time with the night shift telling me the patient, who had a partial foot amputation a few months prior, could not feel below her knee and had no pulses below the knee. The experienced nurse and new grad nurse had not made a single phone call to a doc. I immediately start calling hospitalist. They consult vascular surgery who gets a STAT US. Yep, major clot behind the knee and patient needs surgery. Here’s where it gets tricky. 
This is a dialysis patient with a maturing fistula in one arm that’s off limits to any sticks. Because she was admitted for general nausea/ vomiting/ electrolyte imbalances, they never made her get a PIV and keep it in. She did have a dialysis tunneled line. But hospital policy is that floor nurses could not access that line. Patient needed labs but no one could get enough blood from her to get any samples. Vascular surgeon is tearing me new buttholes every 30 minutes as we have exhausted our options for getting labs drawn. Finally, a dialysis nurse was in house and was able to run down and access the line and get the blood. Then the patient needed vitamin K before she could have any surgery. Again, issues since she had no PIV and we couldn’t touch the tunneled line. Vascular surgeon telling me I can use the dialysis line. Hospital policy says “no”. 
I think I wrote about 20 notes during my shift of the communication with the doc and all attempts to get this patient care. Also, the hospital used iPhones with a special app and all text convos were saved and could be accessed. 
The patient ended up needing a BKA d/t the clot and how long it all took. An investigation was started by the hospital and the surgeon wanted me fired. But I had charted my ass off that day bc I knew it was going to end bad. I was exonerated as I had followed policy. The failure is that vascular should have just take her and put in a central line and then all labs and meds could have been done quicker. Even the ICU doc could have come down to the step-down to put in a line. There were some policy changes after that situation.",1727740942.0

In rangers you play as fantasy seal team 6 going deep into dark enemy territory, eeking out wins where you can. VERY enjoyable co op. 

That said, you are not wizards and so you don't have the wizard creation process nor apprentices. As a ranger you do have access to holy spells and regular magic spells, as well as the whole list of companions you can purchase with companion points, but the magic is not nearly as robust as frost grave.

"Osteoarthritis","t5_3b912","M39, You really need an MRI to determine if (and where) you have cartilage damage in the knee. Mine started as a burning pain in both knees, at the top of the knee cap when standing. I was given many bad diagnoses (quad tendinitis, patella tendinitis, nerve pain, just inflammation from overuse) before I finally got an MRI one year later. I believed it was a nerve issue and worked through it for far too long. MRI showed moderate to advanced OA in multiple spots on the lateral femoral condyles/ lateral tibial plateau. 
Orthos still didn’t believe the cartilage damage is the cause of my pain since I also have good joint space. I even got both of my knees scoped last November hoping that would help with my pain and that was a mistake as I still have the same pain with even less function 10 months later. 
Your pain just as mine is not typical and my pain does also waiver from a 4 to 9/10 throughout the day.

You can force someone into certain kinds of treatment for certain specific situations (suicidal ideation, substance abuse, etc), but it's up to the individual to go to sick call or the ER or whatever medical treatment facilities are available. 

Cadets get sick all the time, just like the rest of the population. The thing about cadets is that they're also college students. Actually, they're more college student than they are Air Force personnel.

And nothing sinks a cadets hopes of making it through training faster than their GPA taking a hit. So they tough it out. They push themselves to carry on as if they're not actually very ill.

I'd be direct with them like ""you're clearly struggling. No, no, don't come closer, matter fact, stand further away from your wingmen. You know you should really consider going to the doctor. Your health is more important than (insert random task). It's really ok to take a knee. ""

Sometimes, they would listen. It's a pride thing, too, I think. You don't want to give off any kind of impression that you're soft or that you'd let the team down. I get it. Which is why I'd release them for the day. But most of the time, they'd push on.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I actually felt like the Karakuri add to the distinctions because although the basic concept was similar (crate to jump, spring to dodge, torch to attach, glider to glide, stake to springboard etc) every weapon had different attacks that had different uses with the different Karakuri, you could do some really cool combinations with by using them well. 

When I changed the weapon I'd also change which Karakuri I was using to fit the weapon which felt pretty fun for me and kept them feeling distinct.

The Nodachi greatsword is definitely simplistic but I do find it really satisfying despite that, also stamina definitely feels like a limitation while charging to be fair (although maybe late-game that is negated). I'm having great fun using the Karakuri attacks to charge and land the big slow hit or using the faster but weaker aerial charged attack.

I do agree on the Karakuri staff, it does feel underwhelming for me currently, or perhaps more accurately not what I expected as I thought it would be more of a ""change form as appropriate to the situation"" not ""change form or you're gimping yourself"".

Like I said above though it really is personal preference at the end of the day, personally I really do feel like the weapons are fantastically designed and on par with Monster Hunter but I know that they won't be for everyone, similarly some people won't like Monster Hunter weapons much.",1727740943.0

Dios es perfección en un sentido teológico. 

De la misma manera en que se entiendo como omnipotente, omnipresente y omnisciente, puede hacer o ser todo,  estar en presente todos lados y ningún lugar, ser parte y entendimiento de cada concepto. 

El concepto de perfección en Dios es englobar todas las cosas por encima de cualquier cosa o ser. 

Concepto fácil de entender. 

Tu preguntaste porque Dios actuaba de manera cruel en el antiguo Testamento, esa es tu respuesta, Dios encarnó el amor a través del concepto de Dios hijo, el cual forma parte del nuevo Testamento. 

Deuteronomio forma parte del antiguo Testamento y ese versículo gira en torno a la enmienda de un pecado en contra de la mujer, leelo completo, el hombre queda a voluntad del padre de la mujer.

That's where outdated info or hallucinations start. I'll just give some context of the APIs and versions of tools used, and just ask if something is just possible... It's already about 95% wrong at that point. 

A huge part of my difficulty is that I'm a library author utilizing recently added/proposed methods with polyfills. So, I might eg be working on some library function to generate an SRI for a thing (script, request, text, whatever), but have to repeatedly give instructions for not using some external library, but to use eg `resp.bytes()` and `Uint8Array.prototype.toBase64()` instead, using ESM instead of CJS (`require`) where applicable. 

However, as an LLM, the bulk of the training data is ""just use this library"" and ""everything is node and using CJS"", and it's obviously clueless of anything decently modern in JS. Literally all of my instructions get ignored and it typically just gives me `const foo = require('whatever'')` as a response. The vast majority of input data suggests that, and that takes priority over my actual prompt. 

I could fight with the damn thing for over an hour... Or I could just write it myself in like 2 minutes.",1727740943.0

Again the own hire thing is pure speculation on my part. Again I was shocked that Spoon was fired as this single season was definitely not enough to measure success.

The asteroid 16 Psyche, for example, is thought to have A LOT of valuable minerals in it that can be easily extracted (*if* you can get to 16 Psyche in the first place).   How much?  

It's potentially worth [$700,000,000,000,000,000,000.00](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/nasa-prepares-to-visit-a-golden-asteroid-worth-up-to-700-quintillion#:~:text=The%20Asteroid%2016%20Psyche%20Has%20an%20Estimated%20Value%20Up%20to%20%24700%20Quintillion&text=We've%20known%20that%20Psyche,in%20economic%20and%20scientific%20terms), give or take a penny.

That's worth more than the total combined value of all human productivity since the birth of our species.  

Obviously, that wouldn't be the real value of those minerals, because the more we brought back to Earth, the more common they'd become, and you'd eventually see the real purchasing power of those minerals decrease like the gold on Mansa Musa's famous Hajj.  There's a chance that the asteroid might only be worth $10 quintillion, which is still orders of magnitude greater than the entire world's gross domestic output.  Importing minerals from asteroids will be extremely lucrative in its initial years (it's not like you can mine an entire asteroid in a day or anything...well...maybe the Little Prince's...) and whichever country can be the first to set up a space elevator used for space mining is going to see a literally out-of-this-world ROI on its space elevator costs.",1727740946.0

I bought a Pyle Z stand first; it was good for a few months, but gradually got more and more wobbly as time went on; the Pyle one (I'm pretty sure) is the same one as all the Amazon ones.  I then tried a Liquid Stands one, and there is no comparison it is SO much better built.  I've been using it for months now, and it is still solid as a rock.  And especially if you want a 2nd tier; the 2nd tier is really well done - it has a horizontal cross brace that not only makes it super stable but also allows you to slide the 2nd tier arms back and forth to accommodate any keyboard width, AND you can also clamp other things to that cross brace!   When I play gigs with this stand, I have a mic boom and an iPad clamp both attached to the cross brace arm.  HIGHLY recommended (and their customer service is awesome)!

"ChopmarkedCoins","t5_2hwsqe","Sold as Lot 763, Stephen Album Rare Coins Auction 50, September 19, 2024. Described as ""CHINESE CHOPMARKS: PHILIPPINES: Isabel II, 1833-1868, AR centimos, 1868, KM-146, with large Chinese merchant chopmark, VF, RR. A rare chopmarked host coin!"" Realized a final sale price of $660.00 against an estimate of $200.00-300.00.

After the wave of revolutions that swept through the silver-producing Spanish colonies in South America in the early 19th century, few pieces struck under Spanish authority were exported to the Far East; Spanish Philippines counterstamps on various crown types of the South American republics were much more commonly used. Few Spanish mainland pieces are known, and only one crown-sized type was struck by Spain for the Philippines itself is known - the 1897 Peso, produced just prior to the Spanish-American War, which handed over the region to American control. While the 1897 Peso is moderately scarce (several examples appear at auction each year), finding chopmarked examples of the minor coinage struck for the Philippines under Spanish rule is notably more difficult. While rather rare, it takes a dedicated collector willing to develop a particularly broad type set (or potentially, a numismatist focused on Filipino coins) to pursue a piece like this seriously.

During summer, there's plenty of praying mantis, ladybugs, etc to take care of any pests for me. All the plants on the porch get my ""coming back in the house"" treatment in fall, with showers and sprays and Bonide granules.

If it's a cold month when I buy it, it gets put on top the fish tank for a few days since that's the only place far from my other plants. Once I get time, it gets repotted or a cache pot, a shower, sprays and Bonide granules.

I spray with Dawn/alcohol/water mix in a pressurized hand sprayer and get all the nooks and crannies to the point of soaked. Let that dry on the plant, then spray it again and wipe off. That normally kills any critters that may be on there. Let it dry for awhile, then full shower to get all the residue, dust, etc off and I let the water run through the pot for awhile to wash out any extra spray or fertilizer salt build up.

"Journalism","t5_2qhym","Been there, done that. It’s hella toxic and you work for little pay. At one point, I was at a national magazine on food stamps. I ate at work and couldn’t afford food at home. When I got off food stamps, I had to work a second job on top of my full time job to make my bills. When I worked as a food critic, I had to put food that I couldn’t afford on my personal card and then wait to be paid back. My boss was annoyed I didn’t eat out more but she paid me less than $40k. In fact, I never made more than $40k. Some food writers make more but think of it like this: can you afford to live on a journalist salary? Most journalists work at small papers. Some work at big papers and make better salaries but they also live in areas with higher costs of living. Of those lucky people who landed good jobs at big papers, very few get a job working on something like food or travel. Usually you work somewhere small first and then somewhere medium.

Personally, my advice would be to look up the salaries before you do this and the Glassdoor reviews.

Consider freelancing for fun or starting a blog or something. Keep in mind freelancing on good writing alone rarely pays enough to make bills. Many good writers have a spouse who provides health insurance and a solid salary.",1727740949.0

I think that shows some great awareness if you're already considering whether you can fit the mobility work in. More is NOT always better.

In general, my thoughts on mobility are: 

* Do it IF you need it i.e., you cannot access the required range of motion for a particular movement/technique without it (I have seen far too many an athlete who spends 45 minutes doing their mobility work before each training session, when they already have more than adequate range of motion for their required sport).
* Full range of motion weight training is an excellent way to get your mobility (and stability) work in. Progressively deepening your squat is just about the best hip/knee/ankle mobility you can do.
* If you do need targeted mobility work, try to ensure you access the newly created ranges of motion soon afterwards. Doing it at night before you go to bed is essentially useless. If you have a problem area (say your shoulders), then some dynamic mobility exercises before training and some static stretches afterwards should help progress things overtime.

  
Hope that helps. Mobility training definitely has its place, but don't do it just for mobility training's sake.

Let me know if I can help with anything more :)",1727740950.0

This is a complicated question and I would recommend getting in therapy and working through this with a professional.

But also, the mind is an interesting thing and we develop coping mechanisms to put ourselves out of stressful situations without sometimes even realizing it. When I was 19 I was sexually assaulted by the singer of my boyfriends band. I told my boyfriend minutes after it happened. And after that, my brain completely blacked it out. It wasn’t until about 6 years later it surfaced one day literally out of nowhere. I was in the shower and I suddenly remembered it. Felt like I was going crazy. Felt like I didn’t know if it were real or not. Did that really happen to me? It did right? I actually had to contact my ex boyfriend and ask him about it who was instantly like uhhh yeah do you not remember that? 

It could have happened and you could have blacked it out. You also could have been really little and only have bits of it in your memory. Also nothing might have happened and you also could have been subconsciously raised a certain way growing up since everyone knew your grandpa was a pedophile and that could also have you feeling the same way you are now. 

I know that I was always was very insecure about my body and always felt subconscious and kind of “dirty” towards anything sexual and would feel a sense of guilt. And I realized later in life that had to do with how I was raised because my mom was super wholesome and judgmental of other women who were sexy. And when I got my first boyfriend at 17 I didn’t do anything sexual with him but had my family members saying things like I was a whore and insinuating I was having sex and in my moms ear telling her I was probably sleeping around and that made me feel like shit. 


I’d really try to take the time to reflect back on how you were raised and things you heard and picked up pertaining to sex and your body.",1727740950.0

I say this as a legally emancipated minor, so I am well aware of being self sufficient at a young age.

Once I started with EMDR the progress was tangible and regular, I would say I am a completely different person from when I started, a lot more confident, have pretty healthy boundaries, am in the career I actually wanted but was too afraid to try for, and I actually like myself and my life (before, I didn't even know that I didn't like those things, I just knew thing weren't working for me). I can still have a target knock me off my feet for a couple of weeks (though it's rare to find one), but on the whole, I never expected or had much hope that my life to get this much better.

Hello! If you haven't checked it out already, [Our Wiki's resources for Squats](https://www.reddit.com/r/formcheck/wiki/index#wiki_squat) may be helpful. Check it out! 

Also, a common tip usually given here is to make sure your footwear is appropriate. If you are squatting in soft-soled shoes (running shoes, etc), it's hard to have a stable foot. Generally a weightlifting shoe is recommended for high-bar and front squats, while use a flat/hard-soled shoe (or even barefoot/socks if it's safe and your gym allows it) is recommended for low-bar squats.

By your logic, he is. Also, saying that senku is just a library is absurd.

- With my rocket research, started out by doing some mad science-like remodeling on a turbocharger meant for cars, but I keep running into a number of roadblocks, since all I have to go on are academic papers. The first big hurdle was about combustion pressure oscillation, but I realized the issue there was a calculation error concerning my homemade 中間周波振動燃燒(← sorry, I don't know the English words for this). Anyway, I managed to reduce the margin of error down to ±7% with a computer simulation that designed the structure of the injector. It would've taken my home PC about ten billion years to crunch those numbers, so check out the attached file for the results. The problem now is that I need a heat-resistant material. That's the thing that trips up most amateur rocketeers, and I'm no exception. With this D.I.Y. stuff, the difficulty just shoots through the roof, since, for example, I don't have the proper material for the cooling section of the nozzle skirt. And since I can't get my hands on the right components, I'm not progressing even 1 mm here. I thought about maybe going with a nickel-based heat-resistant superalloy like the ones used in impellers for thermal power generation, and I even took apart some scrapped components to get that stuff (see attached pic). Unfortunately, the rate of heat exchange turned out to be a total joke.




Simply knowing doesn't make you a scientist. It takes more than that. Will never truly know how chrom would have progressed if he was put into modern-day school education, but to say he is smarter than senku, because he blurted out certain things like a child that senku already knew existed and how to make it but didn't think of it due to a very simple thing. He simply didn't think of it, and it slipped over his head. Senku is a prodigy, a genius. It's clearly shown in the manga. Before chrom encountered senku, his best work was throwing random things in a fire in order to change its color, and if you rube this ball, you get shocked if you touch someone else. Without understanding how. He just knows it's how it is.

"Ultramarathon","t5_2rpg3","I’ve been happily married for 18 years and have two boys (12 and 7) whom I’m actively involved in their life as a dad, coach, drive to school every morning, etc. I also am the head of staff and senior pastor of a large church and school in Los Angeles and work, on average 45-60+ hours a week, sometimes odd hours as I visit people in hospitals, travel to places like the Congo and Brazil to meet with mission partners, and oversee a large staff that can be fraught with complicated personnel issues.

In the last 8 years, I’ve also run 8 50ks, 2 50s, a 71 miler, and will be running my first mountain 100 this weekend.

There’s only one way I can do this: I run before everybody else wakes up.

I’ve found that my consistent time on the trail has made me healthier in every area of life. I don’t have time to watch tv other than what my wife wants to watch together, I have much less time for social media, and my friendships are cultivated much earlier in the day.

I’m a better husband, father, son, friend, and leader because of my time on the trails. I have more resilience, I have more patience, I don’t give up when things are difficult, I thrive in uncomfortable situations, and I find that I have more clarity in decision making as I often process things on the trail.

"AskAstrophotography","t5_240mnx","Sorry if I wasn't clear.  I'm in another meeting trying to respond but perhaps in not enough detail causing my response to be confusing.

You said ""if the object has faint details, they won't be captured if its below the detection threshold regardless of the number of stacked images.""

If there was no noise so that the data are quantized then what you say is true.  Back to the IFN example.  If there was no noise, none from the sky and no read noise and 1 electron = 1 digital number in the digital file (called DN), then less than 1 photon per exposure would never get recorded.

I took your ""Increasing the exposure time helps, all other things being equal"" to mean more sub exposures added.  But you apparently meant longer exposure time in one sub-exposure.  In that case, if the longer exposure resulted in 2 photons per exposure, then yes, longer exposure would help.  But again the result would be quantized so lack detail if there is no noise, e.g. from the sky or read noise, and one could add many images together and still lack detail.    But with much longer exposures, so many photons per exposure, then detail would be recorded.

However, if there are some noise, even a little, e.g.standard deviation = 1 or 2 DN, then regardless of how weak the signal is, averaging many exposures together will dig the signal out of the noise.
In longer sub-exposures, signal from the sky increases along with signal from the object, so while total noise increases, the S/N increases and S/N is what counts.  And when one has sub-exposures long enough to be sky-noise limited, there is no need, on a good sensor, to increase sub-exposure time further (which would decrease dynamic range), if one samples well below 1 photoelectron per 1 DN.  Then one can dig faint signals out of the noise by adding more sub-exposures with effectively no difference compared to longer sub exposures for the same total exposure time.  And one can dig arbitrarily faint signals out of the noise with correspondingly loner total exposure time, whatever the sub-exposure time.

Does that help?",1727740952.0

If you *actually* care about those things, is you create a trust and invest the money, and have the dividends pay you a salary, and a certain % goes to donations to things you care about, have clearly vetted, and know are a good cause. Like St. Jude's or the local art museum.

Animals are pretty dumb, all they know is to consume, poop and breed for the most part so helping them makes sense

People know that diseases, crime, corruption etc; exist and that starvation is a thing, and that intercourse leads to babies, but they still procreate, so helping them isnt really of interest to me, also the world is overpopulated and while birth rates are dropping its still a drop in the bucket as 96% of the mammal population on the planet is farm animals and people, so only 4% is thousands of wild animal species

I volunteer with https://sanctuaryhostel.org its a new and innovative all volunteer 501c3 rescue, the goal is to build and combine animal rescue with an eco friendly vegan hostel and community garden, its based in Mexico as they have a stray animal crisis and in order to get people to care about animals on their plate they need to care about animals dying on the streets, we will invite orphans to the facility and the rest of the community, we will also invite other non profits to use our space, so technically we are helping people but its only because the focus is to get more people talking about the animals

  
800m2 of land was purchased in 2020 and the non profit was formed and i got the architect drawings, but essentially since then there has been no progress, we have gotten 300 volunteer applications but half dont reply and the other half leave after they join IMO its the thoughts and prayers syndrome, there have been a few great volunteers but not enough to get us going so they got demotivated and left",1727740954.0

The city made a deal with the owner and they need to abide by it. If they don't he should be free to close Garden Street to Cabrillo.

I challenge any of you complaining to go out and buy property, build low cost housing, and see what your return will be. You are asking people to take huge losses while you sit behind your keyboard and complain. I don't see any of you investing in low cost housing - why not? Simply because there is no way to make a profit. 

Last I checked, we live in a capitalist society. Projects are done to make money. Our towns don't have the money to buy and develop property so that isn't going to happen either.

I appreciate knowing your timeline and how long things took for you! Thanks for sharing that. 

Things are much better for us…. But when he abandons empathy all together, which unfortunately happens, it really makes me question my approach and if it’s worth giving 100%. Makes me feel like I should hold back. I haven’t, but I really hope things on his end start moving more now. 

I like how you said you consider everything that you guys do today and extension of R. That is how I view all of this, too. It will always be a work in progress. 

We still have open devices and share locations, and I don’t see that stopping, because why?

I wonder now where my husband is at on his journey of not having control. I accept all my feelings and everything in an * it is what it is* type of way. I don’t think my husband’s fully embodied that quite yet.

"SpicyAutism","t5_72j0ci"," In the UK at least, autism isn't diagnosed with specific levels. I was explained during my own diagnosis that it's because severity of symptoms and support level needed can fluctuate throughout your life and certain symptoms can be considered more mild or severe than others. 

I used to be considered a bit lower support needs (I used to be able to take public transport to attend college on my own, but had a sensory overload at least once a week), but after a burnout during college from the stress of that, my symptoms got so much worse that Im now dependant on family, cannot leave my house without having a sensory overload, and cannot function independently like my LSN autistic peers can. 

I would be considered MSN according to the DSM-V (I say this in comments as reference for the majority US userbase and because I do not relate to LSN autistics who can mask, I've never been able to do that.) but levels are not important in the UK to receive support, because the support you get is based off of individuals specific symptoms and needs. (well the damn tories defunded the nhs into the shithole it is now, so like, the tiny bit of support you get, I guess, is catered towards what is needed.)",1727740955.0

And to add to that: setting boundaries will probably make you feel horrible because your mother has conditioned you to accept abuse and neglect, and to make yourself as small as possible so she doesn’t have to feel burdened by her own conscious and her responsibilities (and failures) as a parent. It’s serving her and nobody else.

Any step you take towards actually freeing yourself from her shackles, not only will she actively protest everything to make sure you feel bad to manipulate you into staying small and obedient and bend to her will, but everything she has already done to you during your childhood will do the work for her, too. You will feel immense guilt and shame for protecting and caring about yourself in ways she was never capable of, because she raised you that way. 

I also recommend the book “Children of emotionally immature parents” for starters, in the hopes you’ll see that your efforts are lost with her, and the person who actually deserves all your efforts and energy and understanding and caring is yourself.",1727740955.0

-

Alot of the damage is internal due to duraneg.

But even the pure force of this is naturally crazy.

-

The attack was clashing with an attack of similar force yet still had someone of kaidos durability hurdling through a continent at extreme speeds. So the braking through a continent would inherently be just fraction of what this does.

-

For some references of where past luffy and other characters weaker than this scale

Aokiji instantly frozen the mass of a continent roughly guve or take

Luffy during multiple occasions has threatened to destroy islands all the way back at thriller bark

Bb in his weakest form had a feat which could be calculated to moon level but if you just eye ball it it's around continent.

Don chinjao snapped a continent every day with statements referring to the continents more Mystical properties meaning no matter how much got cracked he'd still atleast need to be able brake the entire thing to start.

And bajrang gun evidently scales above all of those mentioned.

The one at the bottom of the ""7"" is only supported on one side and will be putting a lot of extra force on the wall due to leverage/moment arm. A really, REALLY good L bracket/shelf support could hold a decent amount of weight here, however the long blue piece that makes up the leg of the ""7"" that is not attached to the wall is also supported by that floating piece, so an incredible amount of weight will be transferred to it and I wouldn't trust a shelf bracket with all that. 

Get a nice leg there and all the horizontal pieces will be able to trace their end supports to a stud or a piece that also has both ends supported by a stud, which is just as good.",1727740956.0

When I look at your portfolio, I see some good work (I'm not an art director or anything), but you are not showing much range.  Like you have only shown you can do one art style, so if the project isn't going for that style, then they would pass on you.

Also, one of the jobs of a concept artist is to take art direction and flesh out ideas with concept art.  So for example, you could demonstrate such an ability by mimicking the art of various popular games and showing that you can match art direction.  For example, you could mimic famous art styles like Warcraft, etc.

Another way to show it is to draw the same thing but in different various styles.",1727740956.0

"union","t5_2qolh","Pretending that this is ""for the workers"" is laughable.  But, you already know that.  As things stand right now, employers can already set the schedules mentioned here.  There's nothing stopping them.  The ONLY difference is whether the worker gets the overtime for working 40 hours a week, or gets zero overtime for working over 40 hours in a week...because the law would know make it impossible to get.  In every case, the employer would cut what would be guaranteed hours right now in the following weeks in order to avoid paying overtime.  No one would ever get overtime on a 60 hour week, because every single employer would ALWAYS make sure to deduct hours in the following weeks.  Come on.

***Today's worker protection under full-time, where employers are required to give FT employees 40 hours:

Week 1 (normal full time): 40 hours

Week 2 (company needs extra work): 50 hours

Week 3 (company needs extra work):  50 hours

Week 4 (normal full time): 40 hours 

=Worker makes 190 hours of pay. Because they are hired at 40 hour weeks.


**Project 2025 plan:  

Week 1 (normal): 40 hours

Week 2 (company needs extra work):  50 hours 

Week 3 (company needs extra work): 50 hours

Week 4 (adjusted to avoid OT pay):  20 hours

=worker makes 160 hours of pay.  Worker will ONLY ever make 160 hours no matter how many hours worked in a week.  Overtime pay is now non-existent.  And weekly worker protections cease to exist.

"whatisthisthing","t5_2s3kh","It is a DC Buzzer. 

The two top binding posts are where the DC voltage is connected.

The two terminals, with the horizontal piece under them, is what makes it buzz and produce sound.

Call that horizontal piece a clapper or vibrator.

Note that the vibrator is held in place on the left-hand side, and touches the contact point on the right-hand side. It is just the tension of the metal of the vibrator that keeps it touching there.

The circuit goes from the upper-left Terminal Post to the left-hand vibrator terminal. Through the vibrator to the right-hand vibrator terminal. From there to one side of the coils, and the other side of the coils goes to the upper-right Terminal Post.

When you apply a DC voltage, the circuit is complete, the coils become an electromagnet, and draws the vibrator down to the coils. This opens the circuit (the vibrator is no longer touching the right-hand vibrator terminal), so the coils are no longer magnetized, and the spring tension in the vibrator clapper makes it spring back up to the right-hand terminal, completing the circuit again, as long as the DC is connected.

You have to adjust the tension of the vibrator at the left-hand vibrator terminal so it is not so stiff that it can't be attracted to the coils when energized, and not so weak that it won't spring back to the right-hand terminal when the DC is interrupted or removed.

The noise of the vibrator clapper moving between the right-hand vibrator terminal and the coils and back is the ""buzzing"" sound that gets your attention to answer the door or pick up the receiver on the intercom phone.",1727740957.0
"Canada_sub","t5_6jb8wg","How deep do you want me to go? I could write a novel on this, but for comments sake I’ll highlight the biggest things most people don’t know. 

The public mental health sector is severely underfunded and understaffed. The agency I work for has a 100+ long waitlist just for their addictions team. Each person on their team manages about 25-30 people. Fewer and fewer people are entering this field due to stagnant wages and the stigma this population brings, which ultimately hinders the services these people can access to actually get better, that in turn leads to them feeling “let down” or “forgotten” by the system and in turn they are less likely to try and reach out for services because they know it’s useless. 

A lot of homeless people, the vast majority actually, suffer from serious mental illnesses (typically schizophrenia) which has taken away their ability to maintain housing. Due to a lack of services with psychiatry they often don’t have the proper medications needed so they turn to substances to cope. Substances also act as means of survival for a lot of homeless people. 

Despite popular belief, a lot of homeless people don’t actually want to be homeless or use substances. As I mentioned above a lot of them have lost their housing due to their mental illness and not getting it diagnosed. 

Prison and forced detox unfortunately are not suitable solutions nor are they effective long term solutions. We all know how high recidivism rates are and if you look at the data people who are in prison for petty crimes like drug use often end up reoffending on a more serious charge. Additionally, forced detox is also not viable as you can’t force someone into detox, change requires buy in from the person trying to make that change, also with what I mentioned above about the state of public health sector there are very little services available for people coming out of detox. Studies have shown that detox on its own is not effective for long term sobriety and the average person who does not immediately go to rehab or is connected with services will likely relapse. The thing about detox is is that it’s great to initially get someone sober, but now you have someone who hasn’t experienced sobriety for most of their life being thrown back out onto the streets where they will just use again. Our brain is a shitty thing and it loves consistency, if you’ve been drinking heavily for more than half your life and use alcohol to cope with everything then when something triggering happens you will likely resort to drinking. Thats why we need rehab so they can learn to cope with sobriety properly. 

On the point of rehab, there are very few publicly funded rehab facilities. In my city there is only 1 and it has 16 beds, 8 of which are reserved for corrections Canada. The other facilities require payments far too expensive for anyone who actually needs it to afford. 

Anyway I appreciate you actually reading all of this and hearing me out. I will admit I have a bias in this fight. I was once almost homeless, I was an alcoholic as a teen, got into weed, mushrooms, and coke. But now I’m an addictions counsellor helping people transition back into independent living so it saddens me to see how people hate on this population so much. If it weren’t for the people who had compassion for me and saw my potential I’d likely be dead today.",1727740957.0

She comes from a planet whose Stellaron removed the ability for it's people to feel fear, and one of the biggest factors for her being a Stellaron Hunter is because Elio said she will learn fear.

They for example banned Jeweled Lotus in Commander, the format WotC specifically printed the card for, because they thought it was a good idea to make money this way.

They also banned Lutri, the Spellchaser the moment it was printed, before it even arrived in the stores, something WotC would never do.

The committee always has the health and fun of the format as a priority. WoTC is the main driver in the stock exchanged company Hasbro. They have their own pockets as the main priority. Health of the game is only one factor that pays into this main priority.

Also your comment is really weird to begin with. Almost everyone plays by the rules of the committee. Especially if you have changing playgroups and tables their rules is pretty much all that is really relevant. You get the occasional random guy who asks, if he can play silver bordered cards, a non-legendary commander and sometimes people ask for more mulligans. But that's pretty much it. 

The rules commitee is probably the main reason that the format became this big. They did an incredibly job. I don't trust WoTC anywhere close to that degree. They are are a company and want to make money first and foremost. I cannot even blame them for making bad decisions in the future.",1727740957.0

If you want the certain choice, the CC2 is your ticket.

If you want to experiment, as I wrote in the referenced Reddit thread, any of the top-tier tires contenders should be just fine, particularly if absolute wintering isn't a problem (which is the gist that I get, from reading your OP).  

Even modern tires demand trade-offs. There's so far still no tire that can do it all.

With the CC2, its increased capabilities in wintry precipitation has always been reflected in a compromise in both the wet and dry. 

In the end, tire selection centers around how you want to play this equation - whether you want extra capabilities in the worst 25% of what you \*might\* encounter, or if you more value the tire's performance in the most common 75% of what you run into, day-to-day.",1727740957.0

"ShitHaloSays","t5_5dobuo","1) There were no humans kept on the ark installations to keep them safe from the array at this stage of the story. The exact mechanism of their survival isn't necessarily specified but it's implied to be so unbelievably traumatic the player can put 2 & 2 together that the Halos were involved. That's why I'm so baffled lol. Everything you *need* to know is in the title of the video game.

2) That's not really even a conflict lmfao. In 343 lore multiple modern species had a pre-Flood civilization. How did the San'Shyuum just straight up forget about their whole diplomatic relationship with the Forerunners considering they were also housed on the Ark. People just do that sometimes. Same with technology. It doesn't need to be explained.

I believe the exact, Halo 2-era Bungie theory of Forerunners, is that *Homo Sapiens* were uplifted from ancient Earth by the Precursors, forgot about it entirely in space, had their time in the sun, encountered the Flood, engaged a whole bunch of countermeasures that ultimately failed, rediscovered Earth & the other humans at the 11th hour (*Homo Neanderthalensis,* the Denisovans, etc) built the Ark on Earth & used the [genome of a single human](https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fsn63jmk2f6u91.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1080%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Df101a6fbab3318d49ce0ef7bae36d700e07b016f&tbnid=WDN0DVDOKixX3M&vet=1&imgrefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com%2Fr%2Fhalo%2Fcomments%2Fy5hwid%2Fhow_do_think_a_halo_3_following_halo_2s_original%2F&docid=e7xbbAjb-ZPQmM&w=1080&h=1403&hl=en&source=sh%2Fx%2Fim%2Fm5%2F5&kgs=b8cf1d763f83fccd&shem=abme%2Ctrie) as a template for a bunch of offspring to be created after the Halo fires. 

Basically, there are no survivors, the other humans go extinct, Homo Sapiens restart back on Earth, & this last ""Forerunner"" sort of literally becomes a god by shaping the world after them to their will. The Prophet of Truth seems to be operating with this knowledge in mind when he axes Regret & Mercy: he wants to be the only one to ""ascend"" like that human in the sarcophagus.

Ofc Halo 3 is entirely its own beast. Truth is completely different. The setup for the Ark is completely different. The story is fairly barebones. It's absolutely chocked full of ""you are all Forerunners"" but doesn't attempt to explain how they weren't all obliterated, presumably because Bungie didn't feel it was totally necessary to explain, just like it isn't necessary to see footage of the Flood War.",1727740958.0

"gatech","t5_2r8t2","I'm also a GRA, I started in mid-October. 

Since my October payment could not be processed on time, I got my first payment at the end of this month. 

The amount withheld was U$676.76 from the total of U$4172.73 (mid-October - end of September). Which means they withheld 16.21% of the total amount. 

I contacted HR, and they told me that the calculation was complicated and depended on some factors and that the next month would be less than this month (I hope), but they were not sure how much it would be. 

Does anyone know why I got deducted this rate? I'll be working here during the summer and am also a foreign student (there is no tax treaty with my country).",1727740959.0
