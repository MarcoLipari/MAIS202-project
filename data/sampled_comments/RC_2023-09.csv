Henderson would likely be starting for us right now if he had just kept his head in the right space. Now he has to go to a smaller club and we had to spent a ton of money on a goalkeeper that we could have used to reinforce the squad in other ways.

Ole didn’t really handle the situation well, but if what we heard about how Henderson dealt with EtH is true (not even wanting to talk with him last season), I think it was huge mistake on his part.",1693526400.0

"boston","t5_2qh3r","I oversimplified the numbers, obviously, including just completely ignoring a say 5 percent increase per year maximum or whatever.  Mainly, my argument is that rent control unfairly punishes folks at the beginning of their lease -- so new people to the area, someone just starting out, or someone that needs to move.   And it also highly discourages anyone from moving ever.  Why would someone give up a 3br rent controlled place that's been the same price since 1970 just to move into a 1br for 3-10x the cost?  (My friend's grandmother did exactly that -- never moved -- in NYC because she had such a good deal.  But because she never downsized, that apartment never went on the market so another family could raise *their* kids there.  And the cost for everyone that hadn't been there since 1970 became higher than it would have been otherwise.)

Limited supply and a mis-match in the allocation of housing (ie a single grandma in a giant apartment for a family) pushes up prices.  Luxury builds don't really push up rent prices.  Instead they give the people at the top of the market more options.  ""I would rather live in a brand new luxury apartment where everything works, my packages don't get stolen, and I have a gym.  But before that was built, I could only rent 5th floor walk-ups in 100 year old buildings or in formerly-luxury towers that were built in 1980.""  Now the 5th floor walk-up and the 1980 tower can't charge as much (in theory), because nobody will rent them for the same price as a new build.",1693526400.0

Physically, DD does not have enhanced strength or even enhanced weapons like Hawkeye, for example. DD is a man, so he might be marginally stronger than Echo, but they’re both high level martial artists, so their bench press is arguably less important than their skill. Neither Echo nor DD would be your first choice to fight Thanos, but that doesn’t make them uninteresting, and there is still a lot you can do with these kinds of characters to have them defeat much stronger opponents in creative ways. 

It’s also worth mentioning that, in the comics, Echo was the first person to use the Ronin identity in the modern era, before Clint Barton did in the comics, so she’s also an expert in almost all melee weapons, an expert marksman, etc. That should be obvious from her powers, but unlike Taskmaster, she seems to hold onto her learned skills for a longer time, if not indefinitely. Her photographic reflexes are also useful for other skills. For example, she could watch video of a cardiac bypass surgery and immediately perform a similar surgery. She’s been in and out of comics since 1999. She even bonded with the Phoenix force recently in the comics.

Looking at a few other similar characters, Shang-Chi is just an expert martial artist without DD’s radar sense or Echo’s photographic reflexes. He’s probably a better martial artists than either Echo or DD, but both Echo and DD could arguably defeat Shang-Chi with their abilities. Black Widow is just highly trained spy and martial artist with two electric shock gauntlets who sometimes uses guns. Punisher is just an ex-soldier with guns. Guns are deadly in real life, but they’re almost useless against most Marvel supervillains. Yet Black Widow is an Avenger, and Punisher is a very popular character.

"Toyota","t5_2qwwc","""Turbo vehicles are generally not more expensive than NA vehicles""

I mean.... you take an engine and compare it to that same engine plus a turbo, pretty sure the turbo is gonna cost more. Is the difference huge? Not really. I think the V8 NA in my F150 is maybe 1k less than the V6 3.5L TT competition? So a bigger engine, and cheaper? Then the maintenance is cheaper too. Not really breaking the bank but probably a few thousand over the life of the vehicle. Certainly not nothing.

""Turbo vehicles are just as reliable as NA""

I don't think so.

""Turbo cars aren't always harder to fix""

The ""not always"" argument is tired and lazy. Finding an exception and saying that disproves the rule is dull. If you want to split hairs and play semantics, then let's clarify: MOST mechanics will charge you more to fix your engine with a turbo, vs your engine without a turbo. Ok?

""Turbo cars are usually more efficient and lower on emissions, yes.""

I agree. So the question is: at what cost? And is the cost worth it? To me, a little bit of performance and a little bit of efficiency isn't worth much. I'm not a racecar driver who's trying to shave off 1/10th of a second or save a drop a fuel. Would I take those improvements? Sure! At the cost of thousands (TCO) and additional issues? Hard pass. To me, reliability and cost is by FAR the most important. My F150 already has more performance than I need, I certainly don't need any more. It could get better gas mileage but the 3.5 TT doesn't do THAT much better and the disadvantages aren't even close to worth it.",1693526400.0

Nothing profound before or after. It just happened. Besides my shit squirts nothing has changed in my life before or after I was having my ‘daily drinks’. My family didn’t notice.

For the price of essentially $2 per citizen per year (to put in perspective what a minuscule amount that is when talking about countries), we get access to easier diplomatic relations with the around 80 member countries, free travel with rubber stamped visas within those countries, preferred immigration status, etc, etc. There are benefits to the relationship. 

Now, all that said, I 100% agree that any sort of Monarchy is a problematic concept at base in this day and age. They serve no modern purpose beyond acting as a tourist attraction. If there was a way to be part of the commonwealth without the involvement of the monarchy, I would be all for it.

The thing that highlights Adnan’s true character for me is stealing from the temple’s collection plate. How many teenagers really have the guts to steal from God? Especially ones who keep saying how devout they are and blaming their girlfriend for any problems he was experiencing with his faith. It seems to me that Hae was a convenient scapegoat for him, his friends and family for Adnan not behaving as his community would like, but in reality, his behaviour was all his own choices. I wonder if his mom blamed Hae’s bad influence for his stealing and drug use as well? If Adnan internalised this, her moving on would be even greater an offence in his head and if she was gone, he could go back to being the golden boy, after all she was the devil according to his mom.",1693526401.0

Idk it was tough, spent a long and frustrating 3 minutes on it but I think I made a break through, here ya go: “When god pulled you out of the oven, he went to spice ya up with all those rather pointless traits like: charisma, kindness, perseverance, sense of humors, etc etc. Now it’s unknown what spices he was able to use, but he quickly realized he couldn’t locate the overrated spice of logic. For the love of everything divine & holy he looked around the counters, he opened drawers, he even checked the fridge and microwave because he’s been known to party a bit and misplace the only direct line he had to speak to the prophets down on Earth. God just couldn’t remember where it was prepped and setting at. Legend has it…your jar of spice still hasn’t been found to this very day.” 

That’s the what it says decoded. A million dollars if you can prove me wrong, just think real hard on how one of any amount of skill could possibly solve this. No way of knowing how to go about solving it, the way they tell it in the book gave me the impression the dude may have forgot what the solution to it his damn self, and regardless of that last point, that dude dead rn.

Why would you immediately turn this into a ""well, actually women have it worse, so men need to deal with it"" issue? SA is terrible. Everyone who suffers it needs to be offered support.

Color of snot, specifically green and yellow, is no longer thought to be associated with you being more sick than if it’s clear. I wouldn’t worry about the color of your snot unless it’s very bloody. 

Changing hormones postpartum can cause loose stool. It’s basically the same thing as period diarrhea. Also, your diet might be worse than usual due to taking care of a baby. 

White spots: you’ve got me on this one. I caught thrush from my baby (somehow?!?) and it was white spots in the throat and sucked.

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","Him contacting you 24 h after the first date then again 24 h after that, then setting up date two 5 days after first date is not poor post first date communication...it's perfectly acceptable, you have to realize that. You expecting much more than that after only one date and getting upset over it is the thing that will not work for you going forward. You'll also leave yourself open to the guys that will love bomb you early on then bail after a few weeks/months. You just need to work on being more level headed and realistic that's all, especially early on like this. You can't be getting this anxious about someone you just met. As a person that leans FA (and from your post, I think it's more than you realize), most securely attached guys are going to back away. But they are the type of guys you actually want. 

It's not what the guy did or didn't do - it's you over reacting. That's your problem. If this is how you react to a guy doing most things right then how will you react to the rest of the guys that are pretty lack luster. Online dating is going to turn into a huge chore for you and you'll likely burn out fast.

Also, there's little point in you sitting there like a wall flower and deleting him from social media after you spend time spying over who he's messaging or adding as friends. This is not healthy behavior for someone you've only met twice, you have to realize that. When all the time you can simply text him yourself even to just check in and say hello. You let on that you're not upset but it comes out in every sentence of your post and undoubtedly would to him in person and over text, even subconsciously. You can't hide stuff like that - it's an energy you'll unwittingly give off.

You might need to take a break from dating and get your head straight. Check out that attachment website I mentioned - it's really great because it gives specific examples of how DA/FA people screw things up. Flawed thinking patterns you undoubtedly have without realizing. It's eye opening.",1693526402.0

Apparently there is a lot of fluidity when it comes to closed, hyphenated or open compound words, but typically:

If the compound word is modifying a noun, it usually gets a hyphen. Ex: “sun-bleached curtains”

A hyphens are typically *not* used for adjectives that are modified by adverbs. Ex: “lightly salted peanuts”

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","You can embrace celibacy if you really think that’s the right way. It would mean continuing to struggle against what you believe is wrong but feels like an essential part of your humanity. Repressing that can and likely will cause you psychological, mental, and emotional trauma. 

If you want to do that, I’d recommend cutting off your internet entirely. Or at least, don’t partake in social and other forms of media that will show happy couples going about their lives and getting into all sorts of shenanigans. A convent or an ascetic lifestyle would greatly aid in repressing your sexuality and need for intimate human contact.

Or, you could accept that ancient rules thought up thousands of years ago in order to keep their tribes under control aren’t necessary for you. That millennia old cultures are in no way comparable to yours and as long as you are not prostituting in religious temples to have sex with the gods and other people in the name of the gods that you aren’t doing anything wrong.

If you go that route, you’d be best served cutting off all contact with your old religious circles and to avoid those same religious circles in media and your everyday life.

Sacramento’s temperatures averaged about 7 degrees hotter than less developed surrounding areas. Last summer, a 116-degree-day set a new temperature-high record for the city.

"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx",">If i paint a cityscape that doesn’t mean i’m talking about urbanization.  And if i was which political stance am i taking?  Am I a NIMBY saying it’s bad, am I a YIMBY saying it’s good?  Am I talking about light pollution?  Or brutalism?

I did not argue that all art means something political. I said if a ""reasonable interpretation"" relates the work to politics, it has political valance. 

we might disagree about what a reasonable interpretation is--you might think it's a stretch, for example. 

>You can relate it to anything. People work in those buildings, possibly an accountant. Obviously this painting relates to accountants. In fact, all art relates to accounting, because using a few simple degrees of separation, I can relate anything to accounting.

This, to be sure, is not a ""reasonable"" interpretation. 

Take a painting like Nighthawks by Hopper. Was Hopper trying to say anything political in this painting? Probably not. He's not really sure what he was trying to say, at least consciously, but the painting became culturally iconic, often being interpreted as resonating with the loneliness and isolation of a rapidly urbanizing america.",1693526403.0

[https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dnYLJy](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/dnYLJy)

The MSI X670-P would be a cheaper alternative. Has a better audio codec as well, main differences are just in IO.

For video editing you’re probably going to want more RAM. Changed to a [faster and cheaper](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/solidigm-p44-pro-ssd-review) SSD as well.

The [PNY 4090](https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/pny-rtx-4090-xlr8-rgb-review/6) has decent cooling still, not worth spending more for the Gigabyte Gaming OC in my opinion.

The Corsair 5000D needs to be decked out with fans for it to actually be good in terms of cooling. I’d recommend the Lian Li 216 instead, or the Lancool 3 if you want an upgrade.

For the PSU I’d recommend something with a native 12VHPWR cable for cleaner power delivery to the 4090 like the one in my list.

Then other books as a seperate listing - depending on how many you have either a mixed character lot or smaller lots by character. 

The accessories & outfits individually as they would have been sold at the time - an outfit with the shoes and socks and such rather than trying to sell each piece one by one.

6 dolls should net you a decent price especially if they're the white bodied ones, Kirsten, Felicity and Josefina aren't avalible from American Girl at the moment so are likely going to be the easiest to sell. But the others are popular characters who will sell well too.",1693526404.0

Honestly?  It's the new Bethesda IP in 25 years. I've played hundreds to thousands of hours of their games through the years and always enjoyed my ride, so i'm really excited what they were cooking for so long with the freedom that comes from a new IP, not being bound to the settings of their other games.  
 Now, that was mostly ""why"" i'm excited for Starfield, but if I had to choose a moment when the game really got me was when i was watching Starfield Direct at a friend's house and when they got to the space battles part i said ""Well, that's all realllly cool, but that's a shame there we won't be able to board enemies ships"" and then just a couple seconds after this one of the devs said ""And you can board enemie ships"". I just looked at my friend and started laughing like a child.

"AskArgentina","t5_3622g","Larga historia, yo tenia un grupo de amigos hace un par de años y eramos todos pibes pero despues varios se pusieron en pareja y siempre era juntarse con ellos y con las parejas y yo me empece a sentir incomodo (por inseguridades mias). Encima de eso en el grupo habia un chabon que me tenia de punto (creo que porque vivia mejor que el) y nadie le decia nada.

  
Cuestion que un día me canse y puse los puntos, le dije de juntarnos en mi casa pero con la condición de que no vinieran en pareja y que el chabon que siempre me jodia no estaba invitado. Se pudrio de una manera, las minas me dijeron que no daba porque eramos todos amigos y no daba excluirlos (No mientas flaca, solo nos juntamos porque te garchas a mi amigo) y encima el boludo que me jodia preguntaba re sobervio ""a y yo que hice"" y le dije que era un pelotudo que siempre me humillaba para quedar como un capo con los demas a lo que me responde ""Yo no te humille pero si queres lo hago"" (Mas sobervio que hincha de defensa y justicia despues de ganar la recopa), no solo nadie le dijo nada si no que dijeron que estaba mal de mi parte exponerlo así y que eso lo tenia que tratar en privado (A pero el si podia usarme de punto en publico para hacer reir a los demas). Despues todos se hicieron los boludos como si no pasara nada y me sali del grupo de whatsapp.  


La historia no termina ahi, unos días despues una chica del grupo me agrego y todos hicieron como si no estuviera ahí así que me fui devuelta (no necesitaba otro grupo de whatsapp al pedo). Y no termina aca, días despues de eso uno de los pibes del grupo me responde una historia de instagram como diciendo que no se sentia bien por como habia terminado todo y yo le dije como me sentia al respecto de que todos se hicieron los boludos y como me senti despues de que me agregaron de vuelta e hicieron como si no estuviera ahí. Cuestion que el chabon me dice que estaban re molestos porque me habia ido del grupo despues de que se hicieron los boludos (osea que era mi culpa) y que tenia que arreglar las cosas a lo que le dije la verdad no me interesa y que desde que no estaba con ellos me sentia mejor. Me respondio que que bien que me sintiera así pero que me tendria que poner en el lugar de los chicos y encima 3 DÍAS DESPUES de mi ultimo mensaje así que le clave el visto y listo siguiente pagina.  


Un tiempo despues viene y me habla la novia de este chabon (estudiabamos en la misma universidad) y me pregunta si me pensaba juntar de vuelta con ellos a lo que le dije que no y me tiro la carta de que ese finde le iban a festejar el cumple al novio. Le dije que lo iba a pensar, obvio tire la de humo y ahi termino todo.  


Si me preguntas hoy la verdad que es de las mejores decisiones que tome en mi vida, ni se esforzaron en arreglar la amistad y la verdad que no vale la pena estar con gente así. A veces hay que mandar todo a la mierda, amigos vas a hacer en todos lados pero solo los de verdad son con los que estan ahí cuando lo necesitas. Despues de eso me desarrolle un monton como persona y consegui amigos que me respetan y siempre me tienen en cuenta, no perdi nada y me saque un peso de encima.",1693526406.0

At the same time I feel weird that the only endings there are are sad ones. Even in really dark Japanese visual novels there are often ""good"" and ""bad"" endings. They allow the player to decide what happens based on their choices.

I can't see how it could've been so hard to allow the player to succeed by making the right choices to get a character a happy ending; even if there's only like one happy ending it would be better than no happy endings.",1693526406.0

"GlobalOffensive","t5_2sqho","Fair connection is a reasonable expectation for competitive gaming. 

I think you may be getting server picking with region locking. I think that would be a fair compromise to the issues you're mentioning. And for remote locations with bad ping the most reasonable expectation is that Valve would add more servers in locations around the world. Otherwise, this issue is relegated to players in remote areas, an incredibly minuscule fraction of the player-base where neither vpn, server selector, nor more servers would make a difference.

Choice, in this scenario, is indeed a bad thing. It allows bad actors with easier access to an environment where they can grief the experience of players. Again, fair connection is not an unreasonable expectation for competitive gaming. 

You mention VPNs: I acknowledge that they exist. However, its usage still acts as a barrier. It's another 3rd party software these bad actors have to utilize, and as you say it's a utility for those in unique situations. I wouldn't get rid of it, but I would be in support of more barriers to achieving the end goal of playing on overseas servers.",1693526407.0

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA. Your stepmom is facing the consequences of her own actions, how is that your fault? You’re not responsible for her feelings or relationships. If she wanted to change and apologized MAYBE* that would change things but probably not. All she’s doing is complaining to you about things that you as a child shouldn’t have to hear about. I know you’re a teenager but that still doesn’t make you responsible for adult issues that your stepmom is facing. Involving kids, including teenagers, in adult responsibilities and feelings like this can seriously mess them up. I’m not saying kids can’t know what’s going on but it needs to be done in an age appropriate way. Complaining about her drama with other moms is not appropriate and you shouldn’t have to hear it. 

Putting the appropriateness of the situation aside, it sucks for her but she did it to herself.

I’m sorry you have to deal with this situation. Your feelings are valid, don’t let anyone including your dad make you feel guilty about them.

*the maybe part I was referring to probably wouldn’t change anything, she’s been badmouthing your mom for years and you have every right to feel the way you do.

And about *korek drogowy*, then it definitely comes from the second meaning, the one with the cork. So usually when you are talking with people and they know the context of the conversation, you would just say *korek*, and everyone would know that you mean *korek drogowy*.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Ah, the dance of togetherness and separateness! The pull and push of human emotions and needs. In the swirl of it all, there's you and him, two energies spiraling around a common axis yet yearning for different flavors of connection.

Firstly, the idea that you're asking too much is a reflection of your internal dialogue, not an objective truth. Needs are as natural as the wind, and in the context of a relationship, sharing them is not an imposition but rather an invitation for deeper connection. Your needs for emotional closeness, for validation through the public acknowledgment of your relationship, and for a space where you can share the darker corners of your mind are legitimate.

Your boyfriend's response, ""Maybe I'm just not for you,"" echoes like a stone dropped in a silent pond. It may be an insight drenched in sincerity. Sometimes love isn't just about the meeting of hearts but the meeting of lives, of realities, of day-to-day compatibilities. 

You've spent three years observing, adapting, and contorting to fit into the mold of what he finds acceptable. But here's the essential question: Where are you in all this? When does he adapt to you? Relationships are a two-way street, not a one-way alley. 

From a therapeutic angle, it's not just about making 'us' work. It's also about you—the fullness of you, not just the you that fits neatly into someone else's comfort zone. Are you feeling seen, heard, understood, and cherished in this relationship? And what about him? Does he feel accepted in his way of expressing love? 

Your boyfriend seems to have his own mental and emotional boundaries. That's okay. But if those boundaries become walls that keep you perpetually on the outside, you might find yourself living in a walled garden—beautiful, perhaps, but limited. 

It might be healing for both of you to have a candid conversation, not just one where you share your needs and grievances, but also one where you listen, deeply and without judgment, to what he has to say. This conversation may not result in immediate change, but it can be a beginning, a widening of that common axis around which you both spiral.

Let the wisdom of your intuition guide you. Does this relationship bring more light than darkness? More peace than turmoil? More joy than sorrow? If the balance is off, if the scale tips more often toward emotional famine than feast, then you may already have your answer.

There's a sort of solemnity in facing such a choice, isn't there? Yet, there's also an opportunity for profound healing for both of you, whether you continue as a couple or part ways. Sometimes, in the breaking, things are made whole. 

Listen to what your body's ego, your heart, and your intuition are telling you. Let them be your compass. 🌿",1693526408.0

Only thing pushing me was to not be homeless. But I had no real skills, which was one the reasons my girl left. I always worked with computers so I decided to take a chance with a Software development Bootcamp. 6 month process while working, you’d pay them back once you landed a job. Sure enough I did. Traveled to a new city, met a bunch of new friends, and feel like I’m living a new life. During those 6 months was some of my darkest times, many moments I wanted to quit and thought it would never work out. Just so much self doubt I had. Till I actually finished, and then went into a job. I feel the most at peace now in my life more than ever. I don’t make crazy money but just having that skill and a career job, makes you so much more confident in yourself. One step at a time man.""",1693526409.0

You've mentioned Docker [docker], if you're needing Docker help be sure to [generate a docker-compose](https://trash-guides.info/compose) of all your docker images in a pastebin or gist and link to it.
Just about all Docker issues can be solved by understanding [the Docker Guide](https://wiki.servarr.com/docker-guide), which is all about the concepts of user, group, ownership, permissions and paths.
Many find [TRaSH's Docker/Hardlink Guide/Tutorial](https://trash-guides.info/hardlinks/) easier to understand and is less conceptual.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","A new thing that I somewhat roll with, instant internet success and recognition. A good example is white house down where the girl is basically live streaming the events of the terrorist attacks on the white house. I only partially go with it because while this is kind of what happens now adays (journalists find social media accounts that show a history of problems, tweets go viral that become news stories), a lot of the time it's ""boomer studio exec has no idea how the internet actually works."" See iCarly as an example, if you're popular on ""not-youtube"" you're not going to make your own website to not only stream but host your own live show, especially when you're a teenager (I don't care how much of a tech geek you are), and even with that you aren't going to manage to bring your entire audience with you. I roll with it because it was an entertaining show and if you ignore the pilot of how the in-universe web show got started it mostly works.

ICarly though was still ""when internet fame and success was new"" and has multiple fantastical elements that say ""this is not our universe, just a universe that looks like ours,"" so it's a lot easier to forgive. A show I can't forgive is ABC's short lived series Alex Inc, a 2018 grounded in ""reality"" show about a guy who quits his job to make a podcast, and literally everything in it is wrong. Episode 1, he borrows from his IRA to rent space at a communal work place ""because I need a professional environment,"" completely ignoring the fact that multiple high profile internet creators literally run million dollar companies out of their house (MatPat). Episode 2, Alex and his wife argue over who has to take time off work to help the kids with a commitment, Alex your wife has a professional job and is the stable income while you just started trying to do a work from home make your own hours internet job, there is no discussion you take care of the kids thing now and do whatever your podcast thing is after while your wife goes to her stable job to earn the income that allows you to try this in the first place. Episode 3, they can't record clean audio at their studio so they have to make an audio booth, because it wasn't painfully obvious that a loud communal working space would be a bad place to record a podcast. Episode 4, money is tight and the family needs to cut expenses somewhere, but instead of doing the obvious and leaving the expensive rented work space Alex struggles to fire his nanny. Episode 5, Alex doesn't know what to name his podcast, a reasonable conflict but the way it's written it seems like Alex is already having mild success so this is like saying ""I have thousands of users on my social media site, I don't have a name for it but I have loads of users."" Episode 6, everyone is promoting the podcast on all sorts of media outlets, but there isn't even a first episode; people don't ""get hyped for upcoming podcasts"" like they would a movie or TV show, you need to have an episode that people go to. Episode 7 (and probably the worst), Alex is looking for pitches for a podcast and he rejects all of them because ""they are too niche or not thought out,"" first no one ""pitches podcasts to a producer and network"" they just make them and upload them to youtube and soundcould and others, second there is no such thing as ""too niche of an idea"" because in a world of roughly 4 billion connected people there is an audience for everything, third Alex should be worried about making his own show instead of trying to produce other people's shows, and fourth even if this was how it worked Alex as a complete start-up should be thirsty for whatever content he can get. Episode 8, Alex gets his feelings hurt by troll comments, while I admit that people telling you ""you suck"" among other things if he's getting this broken up over it he's in the wrong line of business, plus it's all comments on his trailer for his still unreleased podcasts and there is absolutely no reason he should be getting this much attention on something that isn't even out yet (like, in-universe he isn't some famous celebrity that decided to make a podcast, he's like a writer for a sports network that no one notices in the credits). Episode 9, Alex focus group tests his podcast with an expensive focus group, JUST RELEASE THE \*\^%(\* EPISODE AND SEE IF IT WORKS! THE WORLD IS YOUR FOCUS GROUP! Episode 10, the first episode of his podcast is the most downloaded podcast in the US and his podcast investor wants 5 new shows produced by him, ignoring the fact that it's physically impossible for the first episode of any podcast to be ""the most successful ever after 1 episode"" (let's call it ""viral success"") and that an outside investor invested in the production of something that literally needs $1000 worth of equipment for start-up, no one with any actual business sense makes giant financial decisions off a single viral success story (but given how poorly managed everything else is I guess I shouldn't be surprised).

/rant. Sorry, it's just that as a hobbyist online creator myself the complete lack of research with how this stuff is ACTUALLY done just enrages me. Like, I get that ""this is based off a real story of a guy who made a podcast,"" but maybe instead of telling a ""1 in a million story that is completely unbelievable to the general public,"" how about you tell the 99 in 100 story about what it's ACTUALLY like to make online content (which is an interesting story, a lot of people like the humble beginnings and rise to glory stories).",1693526410.0

Good article, like always devil will be in the details, and there a plenty of loose ends right now. 

One thing I have not seen addressed in any of the articles is the potential for import/export with other countries with similar medical cannabis programs.

p.s. on note 1 - US doctors currently ""authorized"" vs ""prescribe"". Canada has a fed regulated medical cannabis system and they dont use the word ""prescribe"" they use ""authorize"". Health Canada and the insurers are good with that.

I don’t have a therapist and I’m struggling to find one and it’s daunting and overwhelming. 

There may be nothing in particular making you depressed and the hormones cannot be helping.

"RussiaUkraineWar2022","t5_5wptpp","Ukraine is slowly advancing tho.

Kharkiv offensive was made because of Russian incompetence. They legit just rolled over the whole front because LNR troops did not even have RPGs to defend themselves. They passed trough the first line of defence and DROVE with little to no resistance. That does not happen so easily and with so little losses from Ukraine as I recall. Next time that is going to happen will be the day when there will be so little Russian soldiers that they will just leave or surrender, or Putler finnaly decides to move back to Russia and claim his operation as ""success"",

And Kherson offensive was won by tactical advantage of only one bridge for supply and precise rockets that Ukraine used at full potential.

The great offensive started months ago, and only small gains were made. Of course, we could see a LOT of destroyed artillery, supply depots etc. on Russian side. Today we have reports that second line is being breached at Robotyne. Ukrainians will not be able to flood the region like in Kharkiv because Russia had time to prepare and make defensive lines. Of course, it will be easier, at least in my opinion since it is easier to find paths and roads that are not littered with mines unlike first line of defence.

We need to be realistic, one offensive was won by Ukrainian competence and Russian incompetence, other one was won by Ukrainian competence, Russian incompetence and geography. Ukraine is also playing it safe, some commander told that no matter what. Ukrainian gains now are good because they are slow, but are happening daily, while Russian were not, even when they did it was because Ukraine let them do it at the cost of not losing lives.",1693526411.0

"stepparents","t5_2t08x","You are absolutely not wrong for wanting a few days to be home with your baby and for expecting your SO to have a plan in place. I think the issue here is ultimately that your SO is trying to say “I can leave the kids here alone, and then we’ll come home to him” and isn’t listening when you say “No, I don’t want to come home to them. I want them to be elsewhere, with another parent/family member/trusted adult who can give them the emotional support they need while we’re at the birth center AND for the next couple of days while I settle at home.”

Somewhere there’s a miscommunication here. It could be that your SO is thinking the kids can be home alone if you go into labor suddenly and then somehow there will be a way to get the kids to another adult after the fact and it’s not connecting for him that what you want planned is the way the kids are getting to the other adult. It could be that maybe you’re not clearly communicating what exactly you need planned out of fear of it sounding like you don’t want your SKs around, rather than simply wanting some down time after a major medical event. Maybe it’s your SO being deliberately obtuse because he feels like this you trying to exclude his older children or simply doesn’t agree that you might need time to settle in at home (and if that’s his stance, there might be far bigger issues to deal with). Or maybe it’s something else entirely. But somewhere there’s a disconnect, and it needs to be fixed. 

Personally, if someone asked “what’s the plan for when I go into labor”, I can see how someone would be thinking strictly in terms of the moment of labor starting. And I can see how someone could think “Well we can just leave the boys at home, especially at night, if we need to” is a reasonable response to that question without further elaboration. Now, I don’t know what kind of follow up you had on that conversation or if you talked at all about what to do with the next few days. But that’s where I would start. I would start by explicitly telling your SO, “I need you to make arrangement for the kids to be with BM, your parents, another family member, or another trusted adult for the first 3-4 days (start high, you can negotiate lower) after I give birth.” Be explicit about what you need. He’s probably going to question it. If he does, you lay it out for him. Birth is major medical event that requires rest and recovery that will already be hard to come by simply by the nature of there being a new baby, you are not getting a usual hospital stay with the care level that would be provided there, this is your first baby, and you’re going to be in pain and hormonal and will need his full focus and help those first few days to adjust. Furthermore, his kids are going to have to adjust to a flipped house, you moving in, and a new baby all within the space of a few weeks. Even one of those things is a lot for a kid to process and adjust to, and those kids are getting all 3 and the first few days after the birth your SO is not going to have the time or capacity to help ALL of you adjust. Let’s start getting a game plan together so the kids can have the security of knowing there’s a plan in place for them rather than being an afterthought, they can be getting the emotional support they need and be off having fun those first few days, you and SO and baby can have a few days to adjust, and then the kids can come back when there’s a modicum of routine and stability so their lives aren’t upended too. Be explicit in what you need planned, and then focus on why it’s the best option for everyone, especially the kids. The kids are going to have more fun, get better sleep, get more attention, and otherwise just be happier away from the chaos of a newborn for a few days.",1693526411.0

"AlAnon","t5_2sj6l","Alanon can help. In person meetings are probably available locally. Frequency, amounts, and types of alcohol are not part of the diagnostic criteria. The medical profession uses 11 criteria if you want to try and take the test for him :-). Google DSM-5 Substance Abuse Disorder.

Or AA just has two. 1. If when you honestly want to stop you find you have trouble; OR 2. If when you drink you have trouble controlling the amount, you are probably alcoholic.

My suggestion is Alanon. Whether he is alcoholic or not, Alanon is for people who are bothered by other peoples drinking. And that is clearly you (and me). We can make things worse accidentally if we don’t know the do’s and don’ts of living around it. It makes us irritable and unreasonable without knowing it. 

And never underestimate the power of a good example. You send mixed messages when you drink and tell him not to. 

Whether or not your husband cuts back, stops entirely, or drinks more, you should be  prepared to be happy anyway. Alanon can make that happen.",1693526412.0

Maybe you can dictate how everyone discusses your condition with you. Maybe you don’t want to talk about it right now and you can have a signal that means that, like a bracelet or something visible.

Ok jokes aside... That's bravo. I wouldn't call the terminals expensive (aspecially late game I'm not even close to finishing or even starting to work on the drone but those terminals always felt cheap..?) Well nowdays they feel cheap but nowdays I'm also complaining about a box full of melees after using 10-12ish guns on the arena.

Bravo was never meant to be easy. I usually don't clear it (I have a total of 3 clears on it) mostly because of the recourse waste. I would rather put those guns towards 3 things which i call the 3 pillers of gun.

1. Modification
2. Grind.
3. Recycling


Basically recycle any and all guns you have that are 1-2 shots from being destroyed (and If you are in a safe spot with a gun that you know damn well will break in just a scratch just put it away)

This will get you higher levels for guns in the recycler.
Then I suggest recycling any Uzi you find (they are weak without mods and the mods for them aren't exactly common) and maybe even some Glocks here and there.

Then! 2. Grind. Wait for events like arena or get the battle pass or level 33 for those sweet purple blueprints

Ofc not all guns need purples

Heres the best build for the 3 main guns (Glock, m16,AK) (there's also the shotgun)
Glock: elite shutter, extended mag (bunker hard mode reward), suppressor/ (but extended barrel offers more damage and is better unless you are raiding), green laser and for optics the red dot is fine but both purple sights are good.

M16: grip mag, red laser (only purple for the m16 that you actually want), extended muzzle (the one with highest stability), and either red dot or 2x. I suggest red dot scope until you get the red laser because it increases damage but after the full build is assembled the 2x offers pretty much guaranteed crits

AK: (haven't fully finished it myself) purple (professional) stock, knife active ability upgrade, drum mag, 4x scope, also extended barrel

Shotgun: there's 2 builds for the shotgun.
Build 1: boss build (self explanatory): long suppressor, sturdy guard (purple guard), big ammo, and red dot
Build 2: crowd build (for pd/or big groups of zombies) same thing as above but over the long suppressor you want the heavy barrel with the active mod spread shot.

Holy that is long






Big info here

Uhh I'll just save it for whenever I explain it to someone else as well 

But in short. IGNORE BUNKER BRAVO. Most players will not get all 10 ATV transmissions (unless you buy the battle pass and grind out the 1 in there) and once you somehow in 6 years even get close to the 8-9th transmission you can start working on the ATV.",1693526412.0

You've most likely seen it as it they've been out a long time but in case you haven't it's essentially a very bleak coming of age story about working class teenagers in London.

Depois o facto de haver mais meios de pagamento, impostos por tudo e nada e o diabo a sete não significa que as receitas dos impostos subam significativamente.

Depois mesmo que a receita aumente não torna a saúde e a educação melhores por obra e graça do Espírito Santo. É preciso que 1) o dinheiro extra seja investido nessas áreas e 2) o dinheiro seja bem investido. Spoiler: nem um nem outro se verificam.",1693526413.0

"AskUK","t5_2t4s3","Similar experience. The kid next door had pretty much everything; the kind of kid who's parents didn't ever say no and if you got something new, the next day he'd have two of the more expensive versions. 

We were good friends and one day whilst playing at his house I discovered his Game Gear dumped in a corner (his dad had bought it to keep him entertained on their regular flights to Dubai). I flipping loved that thing, I'd ask him if I could play it regularly but he was the sort of kid who had to show you how to play everything so I never got much of a look in. 

One day, whilst casually browsing back of the Argos catalogue while taking a shit, I spotted it! The turd was swiftly pinched off and I sprinted to find my dad to show him and ask him if I could have it for Christmas. After a significant amount of begging and pestering my poor as fuck parents capitulated and said I could have it but it'd mean no birthday present that year. I was over the moon! 

Roll on Christmas morning and I crack open my present and it's there! I open it all up and something seems slightly off but fuck it, I've finally got a games console and I'm happier than a pig in shit. I put the batteries in and switch it on wondering what game I'm going to be given to play (I didn't have a clue and had asked to be surprised) my dad hands me the last thing from the packaging, a load of plastic cards with pictures and barcodes on them. I'm thinking these must be some cool new feature and ask my dad to read the instructions to find out what they are. 

Turns out, my dumbass hadn't actually realised that a Game Gear and a 'Barcode Battler' are in fact not the same toy. One is essentially a power thirsty handheld version of a Mega Drive, similar in design to a Switch that probably cost thousands at the time. 

The other, is a jumped up digital version of Top Trumps which sees you given a pile of cards and swiping them through a barcode scanner to beat your opponent on points. Like an even shitter version of Pokémon cards. 

I never let on to my parents. I was old enough to know how much they'd sacrificed to get it. Sadly I was also young enough not to understand about refunds so I was stuck with it. 

Second worse Christmas. Worst was when I was around 14 and I woke up with food poisoning in the early hours of Christmas morning. I was basically bedridden shitting blood into the new year... 😭",1693526413.0

Wet food is absolutely disgusting, sticking my hand in water I can’t see because of the soap bubbles freaks me out, not knowing what dish I’m gonna pull out or if this is just a fork or if it’s gonna smell like wet peanut butter is just… I can’t do it. 

I do not care that it “wastes water” or that there’s probably wasted energy in heating the water up, or even that I’m spending more money on soap because I’m not letting everything sit in the soapy water. If my dishes are going to actually get done I throw all the things my grandma taught me out the window.  Everyone scrapes their plates off themselves and rinsed the dishes they ate off of, nothing goes into the sink without being FULLY rinsed off. When I wash dishes I turn on the hot water and wash and rinse each thing under the running water. If something needs “soaking” I fill it with hot water, set it on the counter to the side and do the rest of the dishes",1693526414.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Sometimes a person just wants to ask people directly the way he or she would in the real world. It's convenient, easy, and stress free. It feels very natural to just ask others.

A lot of people don't know how to research things or necessarily what information to trust or not to trust. By asking others online a person can avoid this.

It's very convenient and natural just to ask people. It takes fewer mental (and sometimes emotional) resources to articulate a question and then post it to others than it does to sift through information which can be contradictory and/or overwhelming especially for people who aren't used to researching things themselves. 

Asking others leverages the knowledge and experience of other people and takes the least amount of effort. It's working smarter instead of harder in that way.

In the case of Reddit, many of the people on the various subreddits are aficionados/enthusiasts/experts who presumably should know what they are talking about. Therefore it makes sense to just go directly to the experts and ask them. It saves a lot of time and effort and is therefore efficient, possibly significantly more efficient than researching it oneself.

A lot of the time people may not have the time or frankly the willpower to research something themselves. 

I think a person is way, way more likely to get more of his or her questions answered overall just by asking people than having to research the answer every single time himself or herself. 

I think if people had to look things up for themselves every time they had a simple question that many of their questions might never even be asked in the first place because they just may not have the willpower to do it that way. 

This is another reason why I think the person who asks questions will probably, overall, be able to get significantly more answers to his or her questions over time than the person who feels that he or she has to look up the answers to everything himself or herself.

I think it's fine to look things up on Google or whatever, but it's also very nice just to ask others and draw upon their knowledge/experience, too.",1693526414.0

"PeyroniesSupport","t5_4od51o","Tilting significantly is usually sign of a Suspensory Ligament injury. It may or may not be permanent. Depends on how much it was torn. There really isn't much they can do for that since it's a ligament that should be attached to the pubic bone. Look at a diagram of the penis and the suspensory ligament. Do you feel any pain in the area that it attaches to the pubic bone? You'd be tilting during erection also if this is torn. The main characteristic of Peyronie's Disease is abnormal erect curvature with a palpable or ultrasound-indicated plaque. Only around 10% of men over age 40 get Peyronie's Disease. The number of younger men who get the disease is much much smaller. It just isn't very common in men younger than 40. If you present to the Primary Care Doctor with abnormal erect curvature he will examine your penis for plaque and decide whether your symptoms warrant a referral. All I can say is see your Primary Care Dr about your concerns and get a referral to a Urologist. It helps to have a few pictures of your erection and show them to the Doctor.",1693526415.0

Reflux hypersensitivity is very common and together with functional heartburn accounts for more than 90% of the heartburn patients who failed treatment with proton pump inhibitor twice daily. In addition, reflux hypersensitivity affects primarily young to middle aged women, commonly overlaps with another functional gastrointestinal disorders, and is often associated with some type of psychological comorbidity. Diagnosis is made by using endoscopy with esophageal biopsies, pH-impedance, and high-resolution esophageal manometry. Reflux hypersensitivity is primarily treated with esophageal neuromodulators, such as tricyclic anti-depressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors among others. Surgical anti-reflux management may also play an important role in the treatment of reflux hypersensitivity.",1693526415.0

"unrealengine","t5_2x11n","Well, let's work backwards. I gave the info that the map is 322,5800 pixels x 322,5800 pixels (I missed a zero previously. Damn decimals!). The engine measures things in centimeters so to convert that to meters you have to divide by 100. That means the map is 32,258 meters in each dimension. Now divide that by the exact number I gave of 1,629 and that gives you a multiplier of 2 meters per pixel. That help?

And the formula for converting a map tile dimension to a world map dimension is (tile dimension - 1) x number of tiles along that dimension + 1.  
In the case of the world I'm working in I have 8x8 tiles each 2017x2017 pixels. So I have 8x(2017-1)+1= 8x2016+1=16128+1=16129. Dang, I missed a digit in that previous post! Since each pixel is 2m x 2m then the map is 32,258 meters x 32,258 meters. But since the engine scale is 1cm x 1cm per pixel I have to multiply 100x100. Final map size is 3,225,800 cm x 3,225,800 cm. Oops! No wonder you were confused!

But, yeah, this is the kind of thing you get when you do large open worlds. I figure that a lot of suggested answers I've gotten here is people simply don't grasp the scale of such projects. And many games with equally larger (or much larger!) worlds exist. This is the City of Titans AAA MMORPG game project, FWIW ([City Of Titans](https://CityOfTitans.com/)). I'm one of the main map guys and the person who actually creates our levels initially. Then we have level designers who handle placement of buildings, roads, foliage, etc. I do land, skies, lakes, and oceans (and some forests and things). For example this is an entry level I created much of:

That is certainly upsetting news that you certainly don't need on top of all this trauma. 

Who told you the 60% reoccurence risk? The drs? I am surprised it is that high. I don't want to give you false hopes but my excess of hospital experience over the last year lead me to believe that doctors are sometimes over dramatic to back themselves.

Anyway - I was not diagnosed with this condition, but I have a friend who has it and she is currently 37 weeks pregnant. Her baby is a little low percentile in size but otherwise healthy. I understand it adds a layer of screening for future screenings but it will not impact the birth or the baby.

I was diagnosed a condition too, not related to the issue of my baby that I lost but that could impact future pregnancies, notably fertility. 

I am trying to tell myself that hey, we'll cross the river when we come to the bridge but it certainly sucks.

I hope you'll find the reassurance you need here 🤍",1693526416.0

Every time I open the bin to feed them or just check on/spend time with them (yes I watch them run around and do their thing to unwind after work), George ALWAYS runs to the highest point of the enclosure (a half buried talami pod), and starts wiggling his antenna in the air at me.

I always know it's George because he has longer antennae than I see in most of my other pinecones, he looks like a baby who needs to grow into his antenna, but he's fully grown!

I always offer my hand to George, and he loves to climb around and hang out with me. His new favourite thing is just sitting on the back of my hand and watching me play video games - no joke, after her finishes his running around, he goes to rest on the back of my right hand EVERY time.

I think these little guys are smarter than we give them credit for, and I like to think this is George's little way of thanking me for providing him such a nice home compared to the gross outside full of pesticides and predators.

Your post was removed because it is a very common question or post that is addressed in the /r/chess **[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/faq)** and/or **[Online Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/chess/wiki/resources)** pages. Here is the relevant section:

We get a few people everyday trying to post screenshots of their chess.com brilliant moves. We remove them because it breaks our ""low-effort post"" rule; the quantity of these posts means they would [spam the subreddit significantly](https://imgur.com/a/Z5dtGVl) if they were not removed. However, because people often post these moves with the question ""Why is this move brilliant"", this is an attempt to provide a satisfactory explanation.

As of the [latest update in 2021](https://www.chess.com/news/view/chesscom-releases-new-game-review#brilliant) chess.com ""Brilliant Moves must sacrifice material in some way and must be the best, or nearly the best, move in a position. Brilliant Moves will also be a bit more generously awarded for newer players, recognizing that some strong sacrifices that may be standard for experienced players are quite an achievement for newer players.""

Sometimes when you talk about deeper reasons, you understand that somethings we wish cannot be real, they are just a dream. For instance, we cannot live in rural AL because we will be unemployed if that is the case (we both have doctorates, so no jobs for us there). We also know we cannot live in Upper East Side because we do not have money. So, we compromise. Compromising is a part of marriage. Similar with interests tbh. My husband and I have different interests but we compromise and sometimes do things that other party likes. He goes to a classical music concert with me, I go to a car show with him.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","1. If I won the limited-edition Starfield hardware, I would use it to create a beautiful PC build. I would want to show off my love of space games and Bethesda games, and I think this hardware would be the perfect way to do that. I would also use it to play Starfield, of course! I would want to experience the game in all its glory, and this hardware would ensure that I had the best possible experience.
2. What excites me the most about Starfield is the exploration. I can't wait to explore the different planets and moons, and see what kind of life (or lack thereof) I can find. I'm also excited about the ship customization. I want to build my own spaceship and explore the galaxy in style.

Here are some specific things I'm expecting from Starfield:

* A vast and detailed universe to explore
* A variety of planets and moons to visit
* A rich and immersive story
* A deep and customizable character creation system
* A variety of weapons and abilities to choose from
* A challenging and rewarding game-play experience

I'm really looking forward to Starfield, and I think it has the potential to be one of the best space games ever made. I'm sure I'll be spending many hours exploring the galaxy and creating my own space-faring adventures. ( For transparency, these answers were generated by A.I.; it felt fitting to answer this way since Starfield's time period is based in the 24th century..I hope I win but also good luck to everyone else <3 <3 <3 )",1693526421.0

If you are feeling this way consistently, then explore it rather than push it off. Notice and write down when the feeling or the thoughts are triggered. Also consider going to couples therapy. Approach it as a next step now that y'all are getting more serious about being domestic. An outside party is great to make sure y'all are truly aligned.

In my opinion people who are looking for more are either finding something lacking in their partner or lacking something in themselves to feel whole. Both are problems for the relationship, so whatever you do, don't ignore it. You can not have a healthy relationship if you yourself are not healthy.

"RPGdesign","t5_31cnk","Have you considered using a Cribbage hand as part of a dedicated casting subsystem? Cribbage is a rather complex card game because cards can play multiple roles at once, so I think the Conduit would have to spend several turns building a hand before casting it, rather than trying to cast every turn. It's too complex to do that.

If you want a vanilla implementation, you can count points identically to how Cribbage would and spend them to buy effects. Or you can split points by categories. Fifteens give you DPS, Runs give you heals, pair give you buffs or debuffs.

You can also implement magician's duels rules. In Cribbage, if you miss counting points in your hand, your opponent can take them. If you're importing the rules over to an RPG, you could have the players draw more cards and discard down to the appropriate figure. The discarded cards can either sit in the table for anyone to use or you could pass them to an opponent.",1693526422.0

"TwoBestFriendsPlay","t5_2uzei",">Even when some got removed like Pichu or Wolf, the roster was always bigger than the last.

You can technically say that about the main line street fighter games, sf1 - 2, sf2 - 16(17 with akuma), SF3 - 19 (20 with gill), sf4 - 44, sf5 - 45 (46 with eleven).

The big outlier is the alpha games which even alpha 3 has a different roster size in it's final iteration, SFA3 on psp has 39 characters where as on arcade it only had 29 which is still more than SF3.

 but for the most part sf has gradually increased roster size with each subsequent game.

Before linking up with someone do a reverse image search. If you can find their photo on the internet and in numerous different areas then they are scamming.

My husband and I have 2 sons (10 and 23) and 2 daughters (16 and 19). This post concerns my daughters, Ella (16) and Olive (19). A few days ago Ella asked Olive to pick her up from school, take her to her friends house to pick up a couple things she left there, and take her home after class. Olive agreed. 

The day Olive was supposed to pick Ella up, she called Ella and said she had to get gas, pick up some food for herself, go to the bank, do some shopping for MIL, then drop off whatever she was getting to MIL. She asked Ella to call their uncle (who doesn’t like Ella) and ask him to take her. Then she called back and said my FIL got home early and can pick her up, all she had to do was call when she wanted to go. 

Ella ended up never calling them and asked Olive to pick her up on the way back. Olive picked her up on her way to MIL’s house and brought her to the house, 2 hours after she promised to pick Ella up. 

When they got inside, my MIL yelled at Ella for not calling my BIL or FIL to pick her up and for making Olive wait for her. Ella told my MIL that Olive agreed to do this, was 2 hours late, and didn’t take her to her friends house but MIL yelled at her again because plans changed and Olive arranged for 2 other rides for her that wouldn’t have been late and would’ve taken her to her friends house. 

Ella decided to wait in the car to avoid more verbal abuse and she assumed Olive would wrap it up but Olive left her in the car for another hour while she ate and talked to my MIL. 

Ella told me what happened later that night. I called my MIL to tell her she had no right to speak to Ella the way she did. My MIL responded by telling me she wouldn’t have to if I would and that somebody needs to punish Ella when she’s being a brat. I told MIL that if she can’t respect me and my kids I will no longer be running errands for her. 

My MIL told my husband about this and they’re all mad at me (they all favor Olive). AITA for refusing to run errands for her because of the way she speaks to Ella?

If you keep pushing it you might end up at some point cheating which is worst than just breaking up Asap. 

Trust me, there’s nothing to be fixed in your relationship, once you start about how it might be on the other side it proves that you can’t have anything with your man. 


You better go and talk to him, explaining to him that you’re not into this relationship, you don’t feel it, it is better like this than lying yourself and get worst. 


Breaking uo know just becouse you’re not feeling happy is better than cheating on him at some point, it will cause less emotionall damage. 


No one is obliged to be in a relationship with someone lese if they decide it’s not for them, doesn’t matter how many years you spent in your relationship, once you feel cold about it, just end it and look for someone who gives you joy in everything they do! 


I hope you will make the right decision, it is up to you how you end up, you don’t have to feel bad for breaking up with someone, it’s about them but first it’s about you, your life and your choices, wish you luck",1693526424.0

It's way too expensive... but it looks pretty amazing.  And I have a loooot of skeletons to paint so this is a price vs convenience ratio that works for me.  I've tried a few different ways of doing rust using layers of different acrylic paints and it took longer and looked less good.

1. de neve holly does house transfers so you likely would’ve been placed in it if you opted for the transfer llc when filling out your housing application
2. the first two numbers of your room assignment is the floor you’ll be on
3. deluxe dorms will have air conditioning, thats the only thing that sets them apart. communal bathrooms and study rooms throughout the building. heres a link to the floorplan of [holly](http://www.housing.ucla.edu/maps/holly.htm) MANY tiktok and youtube videos you can look up to see the size of the room itself
4. someone just answered a reddit post on r/ucla about bringing a bike. the overall consensus was dont unless you want it stolen lol. theres not much room in the dorm for one and no where to really lock it up securely outside
5. also a plethora of yt videos on people explaining their experience with dorming in a transfer llc or you can look up the keyword holly on this subreddit to see other people’s questions as this has probably already been answered",1693526425.0

It's a good starting point that yeah, under a socialist type of state the policies would trend towards highly popular programs like even now under capitalism, but they would be better funded and included under human rights umbrellas, like clean water or air etc. 

Tying the two isn't an affront to socialism, nor any system that purports to care for the social beings therein. But yes, you're technically correct. :)",1693526425.0

"ukraineMT","t5_5zk4v3",">Immer mehr russische Militärblogger und Propagandisten kritisieren die russischen Streitkräfte ""für ihre Unfähigkeit, russisches Territorium und militärische Einrichtungen zu verteidigen, während sie gleichzeitig die jüngsten Zensurmaßnahmen des russischen Verteidigungsministeriums kritisieren"". Das schreibt das Institute for the Study of War (ISW) in seinem [Bericht](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-30-2023). 
>
>Ein militärischer Blogger kritisierte das russische Fernsehen dafür, dass es nicht über die jüngsten Angriffe in der Nähe des Gebiets Pskow berichtete, was ein Zeichen für die anhaltenden Bemühungen des russischen Verteidigungsministeriums sei, die Berichterstattung über den Krieg in der Ukraine einzuschränken und so den Nachrichtenkonsum in Russland zu kontrollieren.
>
>Ein anderer, dem Kreml nahestehender Militärblogger bemängelte ebenfalls eine schwache Luftverteidigung und bezog sich dabei auf die jüngsten Angriffe auf den Flugplatz Pskow, die im Gegensatz zur russischen Luftverteidigung auf der Krim stehen, so das ISW. Die Kritik des Milbloggers richtete sich auch gegen das Versagen der russischen Behörden bei der Aufbewahrung wertvoller Flugzeuge in Hangars.
>
>Ein anderer populärer Militärblogger äußerte sich besorgt über die wachsenden militärischen Fähigkeiten der Ukraine und fügte hinzu, dass es ""keine sicheren Orte im Westen Russlands"" geben werde. Die russischen Streitkräfte sollten dies künftig bei der Sicherung strategischer Einrichtungen berücksichtigen.

https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Russische-Kriegsblogger-kritisieren-Militaer-scharf-article24362137.html

Noch ein interessanter Aspekt:

>Pskow liegt so nah wie keine andere russische Provinzhauptstadt an der Grenze zu einem Nato-Staat – es sind nur rund 50 Kilometer bis nach Estland und 65 Kilometer bis Lettland. Offenbar sahen die Verantwortlichen keine Notwendigkeit, trotz der immer wieder heraufbeschworenen Gefahr, die angeblich von der Nato droht, die Stadt und die wichtige Militärpräsenz ausreichend zu schützen.

The thing that will disqualify you is your relationship, though. Head of household at a single address is only valid if you live separate lives and do not share other expenses. I assume since she is your girlfriend, you would not be able to say she is acting as a renter and paying her own expenses and living a solitary life without you.

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I'm going through people's replies here and I've seen this a few times, and have said above- I couldn't disagree with you more about setting up motivations and why people should care. I know nothing about these characters, but have been invested from the start. The scene with the baddies coming onto the ship and killing everyone was enough for me to go 'oooooh they're mysterious and scary', and then when they start talking about finding Thrawn, it's enough to make me go 'Well I guess we don't want him back'. As I said above as well, I have no idea who Ezra is, but the other characters are pretty interesting, and the fact that they want to bring him back is enough for me to care about that. 

I can't decide if I just have a really low bar for Star Wars- because I know I'm pretty critical about a lot of media- or if people are just determined to not enjoy it from the start, so they say they have no possible reason to care about anyone doing anything?

"cybersecurity","t5_2u559","Oh this is a great idea... and I agree - far too many of us pretend to have it all figured out in order to avoid having to answer tough questions or out of fear of losing our jobs! I like to tell people that the reason I'm good at computers is because I've broken more things than anyone else - and it's absolutely true.

A couple good ones with high embarrassment:

* Government satellite ground station system with \~10 data centers globally distributed. Location where our team accesses the system is not close to any data center. System is comprised of thousands of Windows boxes, just as many \*nix boxes, and some specialty equipment. I'm Windows Security SME on the project and my task is to raise the cipher suite standards used system-wide to a level that is not currently in use. Thought I had patched all Windows boxes to be able to use new cipher suites. Thought I had tested the update appropriately. Pushed update via GPO... and within 30 minutes everything stops talking. Domain Controllers are crying, DNS is failing, workstations and thin clients won't let people login, satellite telemetry is down. It turns out that one of the patches needed for this particular set of cipher suites didn't deploy in the correct ORDER thanks to our endpoint management solution. Can't get RDP because Active Directory is down. Can't get local hands on keyboards because data center people are clueless. I wind-up fixing it by manipulating an older Windows box in a strange one-off speciality system owned by a vendor through remote powershell to fix and push a new GPO but that was a god-awful like 2 hours where everything in the world was broken and it was 100% my fault.
   * From that day on my nick-name was ""suites"" as in cipher suites and I was gifted a rubber chicken to display from my cubicle for several months (until someone else broke something else)
* Many years before that - I broke Exchange for our entire org (different employer) because I attempted to expand the disk without fully shutting down the DAG first. Wasted 1.5 days trying to de-corrupt the database until I finally just started restoring from tape backup which still took a whole additional day.",1693526429.0

Imagine a rubber sheet on the floor. Let's say that the east/west direction is space, north/south is time. An object moving at a constant velocity forms a diagonal line on that sheet. The spacetime near that line is curved, away from that line is nearly flat. But the sheet itself is static. There is no need to account for the ""curving"" or ""uncurving"" of spacetime because spacetime itself is a static object. 

In summary, time is already included in the 4 dimensional object that is spacetime. It is only to 3D spacial beings like ourselves that the curvature seems to ""change"" as we move through it.",1693526429.0

As I was coming around the corner of the aisle, my trolley bumped into another trolley coming around the corner and I smiled to apologise and then saw it was an elderly sister who I often took out on service. Needless to say, the shock and horror on her face was so funny I just laughed. I then saw her scurrying off to warn her daughters who had brought her. I decided they are not going to chase me out, so I slowly went up each aisle and never saw her again. She must have checked each aisle for me!  Then Lo and behold I bumped into one of her daughters and I gave a really friendly greeting and she actually smiled back at me.  When you realise they are sad, deluded people who are stuck in a cult and you have broken free and have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, it helps you have no fear of them.  Sometimes I couldn’t be bothered with them and totally ignore them, but that is my choice.

"BokunoheroFanfiction","t5_vlxax","Izuku lived in a state of learned helplessness. It's why he acted like that. He wasn't lazy, he was conditioned by his environment.

How do you train an elephant? You start when it's a baby. You tie it to the biggest, tallest tree you can find and let it tire itself out, struggling and learning that it isn't strong enough to break free. You do this as many times as it takes for the lesson to hit home.

It forms a belief that its strength is not enough, and breaking this tree and leaving is impossible for it.

That's why when the elephant grows up, you can tie it to a small wooden post it could easily break, but it still believes it can't do that, **so it won't even try.**

You could abuse the elephant, too. Why would you be able to get away with hitting or slapping an 8000 pound, 11 foot tall animal when it could crush you like a grape? Because you started doing it when it was young and it couldn't defend itself. It remains afraid of you **because you installed a belief that it can't fight back and doing so only brings pain.** That submission and appeasing you is the only choice available to it.

When it grows up, the circumstances have obviously changed but the elephant cannot perceive the possibility. If the elephant ever did retaliate and hurt you, it's because you pushed it much further than you did before, meaning the abuse escalated past its limits, or it was an accident and it didn't mean to do it.

This same process works just fine on humans. The intro showed you Bakugo and his friends beating up Izuku, who remarks that all men aren't created equal. That was when they first tied him to the tree. The years that followed after that further conditioned him. 

By the time they're in middle school, Izuku doesn't fight back anymore. It's been beaten out of him.

Izuku lived a life devoid of any positive influences, with a mother that pities him, and not a single friend.

Meeting All Might broke the pattern. He met someone who told him it was possible, gave him action steps to achieving this goal, and provided positive validation and emotional support during the process. 

It's no wonder he devoted himself to it with his whole mind, body, and soul.",1693526430.0

It makes awful presumptions about how I’m constantly free and available. Let alone feel comfortable enough to go in for that so early on. 

Also, in general I feel video chat before a meet is lazy chickenshit behavior. Almost everyone I know who pushes for that is glass half empty, trying every way they can think of to eliminate opportunities that don’t seem perfect.

"StrangeEarth","t5_5giqcn","> Lol you’re making a whole lot of “actuslly THIS is how it happened when I wasn’t there” statements my man.

I'm not, actually. Reading comprehension is hard though. I've formulated a logical position, your claim was that we can't know other people would have recorded a fucking UFO outside their windows when they obviously would. That's not even remotely in question. If someone was filming a UFO mere feet from the plane, it would cause a commotion. One person would notice, then 3, then 5, then 10, then the entire plane.

> And yes, I just flew twice in the last two weeks and everybody had their blinds shut once we were on board.

Well that's not typical, and isn't a valid argument to begin with as I've established.

> We know nothing about who is on the plane or how many people. There can absolutely be a plane with like 3 people on it, so it’s not out of the question at all. All these assumptions are being made when people like you just flat out assume you know the exact context behind the video.

Again, reading comprehension. It's hard to take people like you seriously when you're twisting my words. Do me a favor just so I know you're not a bot, please. Multiply 819457x655394, you can use a calculator.

> Also, it’s a recording so that’s why there isn’t any noise, so your assumptions really don’t matter

My dude... Videos record both video and audio, wtf are you talking about? Lol. Also, my assumptions obviously matter to me and many people who actually respect my opinion. It's such a weird thing to claim that my assumptions don't matter, because all you're saying is that they don't matter to you in which case *okay???* Lmao.

* Only having certain building active (Talking about the Megabuildings Mostly and maybe Traum Center, Arasaka Tower...not every bulding).
* Full lit mode, some of the map are really dark at places.

FMC escapes after a couple of days, but finds herself obsessing over the MMC. She testifies against him in court and wants him punished for raping her ... but she also breaks into his house while he's in jail, takes a nap in his bed and then steals his leather jacket because it smells like him. And that's just the beginning of their insane relationship. 

The FMC does have sex with other men but it's with the specific intention of punishing the MMC because she knows it'll drive him crazy.

- recite their mantra in your own words that touch on the their three aspects of self compassion: this is human, be compassionate towards yourself, and mindful awareness (I’m paraphrasing) Mine is “this is a temporary moment of struggling. This is part of the human experience. May I have the self compassion I need to get through this”.

I was in a different part of town this time when I was approached by an older gentleman. I listened to the advice I got on my previous post and this time we exchanged contact info and he asked me to dinner next week! 

I was in the bank making a deposit when this man with a dog comes in and the dog is engaging with me. I ask if I can pet and I do, then leave the bank shortly after to go to the grocery store right beside it (same chain grocery store as my last post 😂). I’m standing in front of the eggs when this same man walks up to me playing it off like we casually bumped into each other again. We got to talking and I was shamelessly flirting this time and it worked! 

Now my new challenge is… I obviously met him in a vanilla context, how do I sugar this up?

You haven't read the bill and already started saying it might be influenced by Hinduism. WTF? It seems you guys have already decided that you want to oppose it no matter what so no point in debating with you.  
  
As I said, it's all hypocrisy. Muslims want to cherry pick certain things from Sharia that suits them and certain things from Indian Penal Code and this is how we want to be governed. Do hell with everyone. If you oppose or question us then you are a  Bigot, Islamophobe.  
  
The same people are completely okay with immigrating to USA, Canada or EU and taking citizenship and being governed under the same law for all but when it comes to India all bets are off.  
  
If you think your faith is progressive already then why don't you demand Muslims to be governed by Sharia completely? Why cherry-pick things from it that benefit you? Why shouldn't someone's hand be chopped off as per sharia law for a crime? Why ignore this aspect of Sharia and instead demand the Indian Penal Code when it comes to such things? This is utter hypocrisy.  
  
It's pretty much clear that most Muslims educated or not, progressive or not will oppose the idea of UCC and most Hindus will support the idea of UCC.

"6thForm","t5_2ybtn","This whole discussion is getting on my fucking nerves. I've never been this stressed out and annoyed on r/6thform. I have half a mind to simple NEVER bring up this subject again, because people don't fucking get it. I'll make myself very clear.

> You're seriously arguing that practice doesn't make you better at mathematics? That practicing mathematics for long hours isn't guaranteed to make you better? Are you serious? Because that is beyond stupid.

Absolute bullshit. I didn't say practising Maths never makes you better. I said hard work alone does not explain academic attainment, because despite the fact that most people work hard, not everyone attains the same grades. There are natural differences in mathematical fluency and this plays a role from A-level going forward. Sure, someone can practise and ""get better"", but this simply means they haven't hit their ceiling.

Everyone's ceiling is different. For some, they might not be able to get a very high grade even despite frequent practise.

> The problem is simply that people give up or are unable to work consistently. You can create excuses like ""other commitments"" and ""family time"", but everyone who wants to get top grades must sacrifice these things to some extent.

I've been downvoted and flamed in the past for expressing the belief that people who want top grades need to make a few sacrifices. I don't disagree. The first problem is that it isn't even always about top grades - to even be within a good chance of *passing*, there are students who need to put 2-3 times as much effort in Mathematics. That's while dealing with 2-3 other subjects IN ADDITION to the commitments I already mentioned. You claim these are ""cheap excuses"". They aren't. Past a certain point it simple isn't realistic to make the ""hard work"" argument, as if people have an infinite amount of time to dedicate to one thing. It's not even physically possible to do this without burning out.

> And believe me, I've seen dozens of students who did terribly at their GCSEs and yet still managed to get As or better at A Levels just because they worked extremely hard.

I have no problem accepting that there are people who do poorly at GCSE and better at A-level, however...

> There is no ""innate ability"", it's all a product of what came before, and what you are willing to put in. This whole ""natural ability"" thing in the context of A Level mathematics is pure nonsense.

This is pure bullshit. The fact that some people's performance improved between GCSE and A-level doesn't prove that there's no such thing as ""natural ability"". Of course, you refuse to accept that anything other than effort counts for academic achievement, so when someone who did put the effort in doesn't get the grades, you simply judge them as insufficiently disciplined - something you couldn't substantiate (because you don't even know the person), in addition to being extremely condescending.

To OP's point, NFC Championships are where I've set most of my single game records. For reference, I'm only an ok Madden player against actual humans, and that was my best game ever. Madden 24 is much harder so far, but big 50 point wins are still doable in the first year of a franchise, so I don't see 80 points out of the question if the fatigue issues are still the same as 23.

I was at a STATE primary school in Toowoomba who told myself and a class of 7 year olds that if you don’t believe in Jesus you will burn in hell. 

A teacher at a self proclaimed “elite” private school ridiculed me for briefly scratching my throat with my tongue (severe allergies thanks to the OTT grounds and pesticides used on their 10 rugby ovals) and suggested I was “signalling that I wanted to suck cock” 
I was also told infront of a class of rugby players that my chosen sport (outside of school, international level) wasn’t a real sport and was “gay”. They now offer said sport as part of their curriculum. 
Waiting to be collected after having to stay back too late to catch the bus a teacher accused me of “hanging around like a dog on heat”. 
Deputy principal went on an absolute histrionic tirade in-front of the entire school because a border was caught with weed in his dorm, and simply expelling him wasn’t enough. His own son was in my grade dealing weed to the entire class. 
Routinely told that when we turn 18 you should only ever vote for LNP. 
Countless instances of blatant bullying from teachers.

I think my biggest kink overall is sadism though.  I don’t know a better word for it … it’s not the hurtful kind.

I love choking, slapping and spitting on my partner.  I only do it a little hard just so he feels a little bit of pain in a good way.  Like how it feels to push down on a sore muscle kinda way (I also love giving him deep massages that make him cry out 😈).

I love slapping his face, he always sighs and giggles with pleasure. When I choke him, he sticks his tongue out and pushes my hands into him harder.  Spitting … it’s so gross … I won’t even watch it in porn. But dominating him like that feels so good.

This is all consensual and we’ve learned to do the activities safely (especially choking which is dangerous).

But it feels so good because the trust is so strong he knows I won’t hurt him, and I know I won’t either.

Poppers were originally prescribed by doctors about 120 years ago for heart issues as they're a vasodilator (they relax smooth muscle, such as blood vessels, your butt, and vaginal muscles). This is also where a big warning comes in: do not use with other drugs that lower blood pressure such as viagra and other ed prescriptions. They are also very dangerous if ingested. Legal in the UK, even with a famous LGBT member of parliament arguing for the legalization and admitting to his use. 

Here's a link to start with. I remember reading a different article that did a great job of going through history, the science behind poppers, safety, and even some of the manufacturing proprietary secrets.

"dancemoms","t5_2u0sl","Honestly, I think she was one of the best moms on the show. She clearly loved her kids and wanted to protect them; she’s one of the few moms that genuinely seemed to care more about her kids’ mental well-being than she did about fame or money.

All that said, I think the show was bad for her mentally and kind of drove her to the brink of a nervous breakdown. Honestly, I feel like Kelly’s reactions were the most “normal” of any of the moms — sure, she didn’t always say the right thing, and some of her reactions may seem “extreme” to us watching, but a lot of us would probably react the same way if we were put in such an extreme environment. It’s very clear to me that for Kelly — maybe more than anyone else, including the other OG moms — everything happening on the show was very “real,”, at least in an emotional sense. She couldn’t brush things off, like “oh Abby didn’t mean that,” or “Oh it’s just for the show.” She took everything very much to heart, I think. 

Overall, I really feel for her and hope she’s recovered from what must have been a really traumatic experience for herself and her kids. I also think she’s absolutely hilarious and really self-deprecating in a way that wasn’t necessarily depicted on the show (I feel like her sense of humor really comes through on the BTTB podcast; on the show they mostly just depicted her like a total airhead/crazy person).",1693526435.0

Od kad zna za sebe, Zlatko je bio privučen svjetlošću. Mrzio je mrak jer tada nije ništa vidio, a mrzio je i činjenicu da je on upravo noćni leptir. On bi sebe radije nazvao leptirom svjetlosti.  U svakom slučaju, Zlatkova prošlost je bila burna. Imao je djevojku koja ga je ostavila radi livadnog leptira, a nakon nje, sve je krenulo nizbrdo. Upao je u lošu ekipu, ekipu moljaca i radio nezakonite radnje poveden njihovim primjerom. Na kraju se odao cvjetnom nektaru. U posljednji je trenutak shvatio da je spas upravo u blještavilu.  Do tog zaključka Zlatko je došao kad je u mrklom mraku udario u far automobila. Jedva je preživio udarac i shvatio da je upravo svjetlo donositelj života i smrti. I zato se Zlatko uputio najsjajnijem od svih svijetala, suncu.  Kad je svanulo jutro, Zlatko je krenuo. Gore, gore, gore i još gore. Sve više i više je letjeo, osjećajući ogromno zadovoljstvo samim sobom. Sunce je zasjajilo punom snagom i Zlatko je već bio na visini od 1500 metara. Međutim, nalet vjetra je našeg nesretnog Zlatka bacio ravno na put putničkom avionu marke Boeing. Posljednje što je Zlatku prošlo kroz glavu dok je udarao o pilotsko staklo, je bio upravo njegov šupak.",1693526436.0

I could go to the dentist, but it would require an entire day off of work and would be around 1.5hrs each way for a 10 min drive. My doctor is a 30min walk, but there are no sidewalks and it is on a major road. 

Unfortunately I think this route is worse than my old route. There was a fight on the bus and I had forgotten about Bus Smell and being followed home by men.

While I'd agree the blue-backed item blueprints are pretty hit or miss, we've experienced the opposite for the purple-backed random items, which are consistently useful (though it is weird how like 1/5th of the deck is best in slot for >!Trap!< specifically).

This would require a *very* significant amount of resource cost/gain reworking, since letting you double build more often would make being prosperity capped (and, thus, unable to build further) incredibly common.

But it’s also the unspoken, like the way he doesn’t quite look anyone in the eye at the start of the 13 year skip or the moment at the bridge. 

There’s just a lot of depth to his character and I really appreciated having such a strong protagonist that also showed he had emotions, even the vulnerable ones. His resolve even after all of the trauma he’d been through, was inspiring. He never gave up.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","Has she recently given birth?  Is she still pregnant?

Sex can be uncomfortable for some women when they are heavily pregnant.

Some women lose interest in sex for several months after giving birth.  They may be exhausted.  Birth may have left them finding sex painful due to scarring 'down there'. There may be some loss of sensation. They may be too anxious about getting pregnant again.  They may develop post mnatal depression.  Some women lose interest in sex while lactating for hormonal reasons.  

But fatigue is usually why.  Looking after a baby all day can leave someone not wanting to be touched anymore.

My advice is to stop having sex for now.  Its not a neccessity of life.  Instead work on communicating without pressure, let her know its ok if she doesnt want to at this time in her life.  Give her as much support as possible, help her open up. Be the best father and husband possible now, who respects her boundaries and feelings and I promuse you this, when she does get the mood back you will be having the best sex of your life!  Because she trusts you and feels safe with. If she has unwanted sex with you, the opposite will happen. It will break her love for you.",1693526436.0

"fnaftheories","t5_36f29",">This theory has some actual evidence, the graphic novel isn't a good one. Some legit evidence is that the withereds are never shown out of fnaf 2, and the only in-universe ""official"" appearence is one sign with withered freddy in pizza sim, but other than that classic freddy is always shown as the face of the company in most signs and logos.
It's strange that fazbear ent would show pictures of the fnaf 1 and 2 pizzerias in rockstar row but not the pizzeria with the supposed ""unwithereds"". Why would they exclude them? Fear of mentioning the location of the MCI? Can't be, the fnaf 2 pizzeria was only open for two weeks and the DCI happened, with kid's corpses lying around, if one pizzeria were to be associated with a bloody incident of the company it would be that one

They didn't exclude anything. They just made it obvious game logic. The unwithereds are always the original characters. They're just prototypes to the Fnaf 1 gang. If we know that this 1985 pizzeria is to exist, it can't be the Fnaf 1 models because they were made in 1993 like confirmed. It can't be Fredbears because there's no actual suit display of the four. And there are a bunch of ""grand- reopening"" or ""new and improved"" clues all around Fnaf 2 indicating something happened before this location opened up. And we know the withereds were the only ones broken, meaning with all these clues, they weren't like this beforehand. They must've had a location before they were thrown out. 

The reason Fnaf 1 and their versions are more primary than the older ones is because of the style and it's just a better choice than the withereds for some reason.",1693526437.0

We load in and I was paying more attention to getting my SAM skills right since this was my first time in as SAM anywhere. First trash pull is uneventful then we hit eyeball boss. It’s 50/50 if this goes well. I suddenly realize the target of the boss is NOT any of the tanks…it’s flopping all around and blasting everyone and we’re all getting doomed left and right…it wasn’t pretty. At one point I notice our tank isn’t even in the arena?? His name is greyed out. We wipe and start again; somehow we manage to vote kick him! Get a new tank….as we’re starting the boss again. So our new tank, while willing and able, is now somehow stuck outside the arena. Other tanks continue not tanking, but somehow we make it through and our tank picks up MT.   
The rest of the run was fine but what a rocky start. Cerberus, my team decided we should go belly just in case because we didn’t trust B to follow the rules and didn’t want another wipe. And what’s bad about more dps in belly? Nothing. Things are going fine till someone mentions “hey what do I do when there’s nothing in the belly” and we realized someone had gotten in the belly after we’d all been expelled?? So they were just chilling?? Till suddenly ADDS SPAWNED and they were the only one in there. I was cackling by this point and almost cried. I’ve literally never seen this and the thought of one lone tiny shrunken WoL inside Cerberus as we’re beating his ass on the outside is just hilarious. And then we killed him while that person was still in the belly?? What happened to them?? (They were fine. But the idea that Cerberus died with someone inside him was just too funny.)  
Cloud of Darkness was totally fine except that I was having trouble breathing from laughing so hard. And lo and behold! A Syrcus shard dropped! This was literally my first time ever seeing one and I rolled a 44 on it, sadge, but I had bought a tower for my house a while back so it wasn’t a big loss. And I’m happy that the other person who got it wanted the tower too.   
All in all, cursed run, but I haven’t laughed this hard in a very long time.   
I recorded everything (minus my cackling, you’re welcome, I won’t subject anyone to that) and it’s on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JilSIGJV3bQ) as well if you’re curious about how this all went down.

I knew gay people existed and it wasn't that I ever thought that they were bad (as a NB aroace I considered myself at the very least an ally) but I've had cishet romance shoved in my face since I can remember. And despite being aroace I do consume a lot of romance stories. It's one of my favorite tropes. But I was always consuming hetero romance stories and I never really cared for or sought out any homosexual romance stories. In shows like GoT it was very in your face in a way that (for f/f anyway) made me feel like it was purely fanservice, and there wasn't a lot of m/m on screen so it was obviously for the male gaze.

But in The 100 it was eased into so gradually that when Clarke and Lexa shared their first kiss I didn't even question it (I thought Clarke was straight bc of her love for Finn) or care, it was simply beautiful. It didn't feel like it was written by males for male enjoyment. There was no fetishization imo. It felt like a real romance between two people who had a history together. I was invested in them before they met each other, when they met, and when they got together. I saw their relationship go from enemies to lovers (a favorite tropes of mine that certainly helped.)

In GoT when we see 2 people of the same sex kissing (or more) it's usually 2 people with very little involvement before that encounter (like Yara and Ellaria) or 1 main cast and a random character who exists for that episode/that scene alone and never again. Fanservice.

The Clarke/Lexa romance opened up a whole world to me that unfortunately, mostly only fanfiction can meet. Before then I knew that same sex relationships existed and were real but I had never seen it depicted as a real romance on screen. I know there are good books and movies/tv shows out there that do justice to same sex couples but they're not always the big popular stuff that everyone has seen or heard of. 

While I still *prefer* the m/f ships because I've consumed them so long it's just familiar and I know the types/dynamics I want to read about, I no longer view m/m or f/f as a reason to ""nope out"" of a story. It's no longer ""not for me."" I learned that the same things that can draw me into a ""straight"" romance are the exact same things that will draw me into a ""gay"" romance. The characters and the way their lives connect.",1693526438.0

"BreakingPointsNews","t5_4ilizl","Why are you talking about the black vote? I never mentioned it. Although since you did the  polls show Biden is loosing the black vote a little each day and they seem to be moving towards trump at least African American males. 🤷 but I never mentioned the black vote so I’m not sure why you brought that up.

The difference in Biden old vs RFk or even West is night and day. Again like I said biden keeps going on these old man  rants full of lies that are not even possible to be grounded in reality. It’s sad, it’s elder abuse. 


And I didn’t say it during 2020 because I got in line swallowed my pride and voted Biden even tho that election and the election before the dnc made sure the candidates I liked got no chance. Much like this year…but again that isn’t surprising to me after I educated myself  on the lawsuit the dnc was part of where’s they openly admitted they don’t have to give we the people democracy because they are a business, they can do what’s best for business. Once you know that it’s no surprise we keep getting these shitty candidates. 

And are you even a breaking points fan?  Krystal and saagar keep  doing segments on how trump and Biden are neck and neck and every single  time they hit him with more charges trump goes up. So I’m not sure where your numbers are from. 

Btw the stats in my last comment about how trump has retained most of his voters and Biden keeps loosing his  were from the New York Times.

But anyway 
Good luck. I’m not on the vote blue no matter who cult match this time. I prefer to have democracy, where we don’t put forth the two most unpopular candidates in history and are stuck voting yet again the lesser of two evils.

So i met my friends and started to talk about stuff that happened after graduation. But during the dinner, my gf constantly texted me, asked bullshit stuff, bitched and moaned about how she feels. A couple of texts is ok but she bombarded me. She was literally begging for attention. 

After the bombardment of texts she called me. I excused myself from the table and went outside to talk to her. She was blaming me for having a fun time without her as if she is supposed to be the only good thing in my life. 

Her passive aggresive manner and outright blaming me took away my joy so i had to leave early. 

When i got home, i called her and she acted as if nothing happened. Even asked me why i left early. 

That was the moment i noticed her toxic personality.",1693526439.0

An Intoxylizer works like this: (ELI5). You blow into a tube. At one end of the tube is a light source. At the other end of the tube is special paper hooked up to a computer. The computer knows how much light the light source usually puts off. When your breath goes into the tube, the alcohol molecules refract, or bounce, the light around in the tube at a measurable rate relative to the amount of alcohol in your breath. The computer measures the lack of light relative to an empty tube and then determines BAC by math. 

The machines suffer from a ton of errors.

"movies","t5_2qh3s",">I know Alan Moore hates any of the film adaptations of his works, but I think this one stands out and is far and away the best of them.                  
                 
Is not that he blanket opposes any adaptation. Is more that he sees the machine behind it.

After the first run, the gold on restart was listed as 1.39e3%
This took the first enemy from 9g to 87g a kill.

Then when ending my second run. The restart was listed as 5.18e3%. This gave 326g on first creature.
So I was making good progress.

Then finally when ending the third run. The gold restart was listed as 6.19e3% (small progress). My fourth run began with the Cave Scarab offering only 154g. So bust.

The other day I was walking to a bus stop and I seen a man walking in the distance (it was getting dark) is that makes any difference, but I was genuinely horrified and kept thinking “he’s going to rob and stab me” this type of thing happens so many times a day and every single time I get into a car I think I’ll never make it to my destination and I still don’t rlly know what it is… 

I have intrusive thoughts all the time and I have these like visions every day like my mind makes up a million different ways I could die everyday and I try ti just stop thinking about it but I feel it just gets worse and worse until I’m out of the situation or in my room alone … it’s really scary.

They are quite short which makes be nice to try a new format and the narration is done very well. Audiobooks can be a bit pricey so some will suggest staying away from novellas which is a fair point.

Other suggestions of stand-alones/short series with great narration:
First Law Trilogy, grimdark fantasy. I'm not honestly a fan but the narration is widely accepted to be amazing.

Bobiverse Trilogy, science fiction. Excellent narration follows a guy that gets uploaded into a spacecraft computer and is exploring the stars.

The Martian or Project Hail Mary, both science fiction with excellent narration. PHM is a rare example where I think the audiobook is the superior format for the series.

Legends and Lattes, cozy fantasy. Retired orc adventurer opens a coffee shop.",1693526441.0

Eu no caso fui ficando pela falta de ter uma parceira mesmo, desde quando terminei com minha última comecei a usar a masturbação como o único alívio. 

Não posso sair com outra mulher pq não tenho condições, estou desempregado e sem dinheiro pra nada. Daí comecei a ter uma rotina com porno e entrei em depressão, me masturbo pelo menos umas 3 vezes ao dia, tem vezes que me masturbo 10. 

Meu principal problema é a masturbação mesmo, a pornografia nem estou viciado, o engraçado que fui desanimando do porno. 

Mas em seu caso me intriga, vc tem namorado e é mulher, alguma coisa tem de errado aí. Entendo que depressão não é nada fácil, mas como é sua rotina? Oq tem feito além de trabalhar, fazer sexo e ver porno?

"Starfield","t5_3g41m","Well Grats.. I'm a disabled Vet, formerly a homeless alcoholic and heroin addict (20yrs ago) when I got home from the service and I can tell you from my years of living in hospitals and running houses and programs to help other Vets get clean that what you've done is almost an impossibility for most. Without help it is extremely hard to stop, especially the amounts you were drinking, I've seen people go into shock and become completely disconnected from reality without medical intervention. It is very possible to die from sudden alcohol withdrawal so it's good to hear you managed well. (Not that you said you did not get help, you may have simply chosen not to share that.) But it's even harder to stay stopped. I have 16 years being clean and it's still important for me to help others so I can see and be reminded of the struggle and pain to be able to persist. It's a fuck ton easier as the years go on but it's never gone, it's never over, there's always a bad choice around every corner that must be avoided. 

Anyway, for you finding something that can motivate you to that extent and give you the commitment and the drive, especially with the amounts you were drinking, that's impressive and should be congratulated but if you're at all receptive to a little advice from a miserable old drunk who changed and made a decent life for himself I would say it is very important that you don't do it alone. I never liked AA, I don't believe in higher powers, I got clean without it but not without help. I had other Veterans in the VA, cognitive behavior therapy, a ton of resources and it took me years of relapses sometimes after 6 months of sobriety, living inpatient, doing program after program before I finally accepted that I, (me not you) could not do it alone. And I didn't need to. No one does. But however you do it, just don't drink! lol.. 

Enjoy playing tonight. Enjoy the life you've regained and be proud of the massive accomplishment. Grats!

PS (And something I wish someone told me, if you ever do fuck up, do not let it get to you, what you did yesterday doesn't matter today. If you do fuck up, just don't KEEP fucking up. AA people have a habit of worshipping dates and sobriety periods which can help but can also hurt when someone feels failure and guilt over a relapse. If it happens it happens. Just get up and keep trying. No one I know got it the first time they tried and wouldn't be where they are if they let that stop them from trying again).

Sorry if that was preaching. I am very proud of you and anyone who gets clean as odd as it may sound coming from a stranger and with my experience in losing so many friends, so many residents of the house I ran, so many good people, good soldiers and Veterans, young and old, rich and poor, who maybe I could have helped by being a little more preachy. Good luck. Sincerely.",1693526441.0

"EndlessWar","t5_2s4wg","I just laughed out loud. I guess that is one way of looking at it. On the other hand the Russian military has shown the world it’s true conventional capabilities and in doing so fine irreversible damage to the worlds perception of its capabilities. Military historians will be studying this war fir centuries in how not to conduct a war. 

The reality is Russia tried to take Ukraine and in front of the world got trashed on and forced to retreat from 60% years of what it originally stole at the apex of its invasion. It conducted a 10 month ‘offensive’ that went nowhere and are now being n the defence desperately trying to hold onto what it still as. As it stands it’s moving backwards. 

As for lots of Ukrainians dying. Sure, it’s a full scale conventional war. However, the Russian armed forces have likely been attritioned even more than the Ukrainians when you factor everything in. 

We know from satellite imagery from several months ago that Russia has lost half its total MBTs and IFVs. We also know the most numerous type it can now pull from are t50/60 series. Russia literally can’t afford to do this another 2 years. 

The reality is they have failed, spectacularly",1693526443.0

I started indoor (a couple times outdoor ) rock climbing this last year and it’s made me much more comfortable on class 3/4 terrain.  The 14ers sub is a good place to find others tackling all kinds of different routes. 

Winter is a lot of challenges with avalanche danger in Colorado but I’d say start with snowshoeing or hiking easy routes in the snow and get comfortable in that environment.  You can do bierstadt and quandary year round with limited avalanche risk to get comfortable with the elements.",1693526443.0

Look what happened during and after the pandemic.   Prices soared, many things were unavailable in some areas, and crime in some areas is still higher now than before.  Most of us stayed put instead of an alternate location.

"amiwrong","t5_2sf00","Yeah hearing these takes of men that don't want woman as friends seems like people telling on themselves.

It's rare I find people who are so in sync when it comes to a sense of humor but other than that I am far from sexually attracted to them. One of them is pretty conveniently attractive but I value our friendship so much that I don't have any feelings for her beyond friendship. 

I've always been able to hang out and have women friends as well as guy friends and it seems like most of my friends that are guys also have friends that are women that are part of the group. 

Our friend group in college was a healthy mix of men and women none of whom hooked up with each other or dated one another. There was just very little if any sexual tension among us.",1693526443.0

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","I get what you are saying, I'm a fairly new player to the game (only a couple of months) and I'm looking at the engineering, guardian tech etc. And thinking that I need to do these bits before I go looking for the alien threat.

But then I start thinking that these have been in the game for a few years now, why aren't engineered parts available to buy without going to the engineers, or the guardian tech avaliable without me having to unlock it?

But if it was where would my sense of accomplishment be?
Just because someone else has done it before doesn't mean that I get a free pass.

The one thing that I would like to see is second hand ships, with the fleet carriers now being everywhere why can a commander sell ships they may no longer want to newbies?

I was playing Chrono Stones in the match against Protocol Omega in FF Stadium. There's a point in which you have to fill the stupid bar and the fate wanted me to do an offside right before completing it.

The foes had to use the Bermuda Triangle and then give the ball to Alpha who was supposed to be invincible, but right when they used the technique, the offside pop up appeared and they Alpha lost the ball.

 I continued playing without knowing why the first half was taking so long. I realized a bit too late to have screwed up XD

"AutismInWomen","t5_3yx96k","I felt like this for years and then I got a chronic illness and ended up becoming a housewife. Being a housewife is a job, too, and I don't feel trapped at all! It has a long ""interview"" process (dating), but it can be really rewarding and I have lots of flexibility to keep learning, reading, and investigating special interests (and even applying them to running my household, like cooking authentic Indian food or something).  
there's also the avenue of just doing a bunch of unusual jobs as an autistic person like maybe try animal behavior research, teaching English in a foreign country, copywriting, counseling, dog walking, waitressing, or even volunteer positions that give you a stipend like Americorps, Peace Corps, WWOOF, etc. or start your own business(es). Jobs can be a way to learn and try new things, you don't necessarily have to have a big career or feel trapped in one thing. as long as your expenses are low enough, you can just do whatever, and many autistic women do this pattern to keep the novelty and learning going. it comes at a cost of prestige and financial rewards, but it is another option.

"Somalia","t5_2qm0m","Okay my sweet Somali sister, I will give you my honest thoughts and inshallah it’s of some be for to you. I mean with upmost sincerely and respect.

I have read your original message and all of your replies to the messages. You are currently pursuing an advanced degree (medicine mashallah), which will take up the rest your of your late 20’s / early 30’s (maybe) and it’s serious degree which will demand a lot form you both whisky in school and at work. The reason why say all of this, is because most Somali men I find tend to want to create a traditional family (with the woman eventually work part-time or not at all). Some Somali men who are also career driven AND want a more “modern” family setup can be found, but they are in the minority.

Secondly, walal macaan, I may have misunderstood you but you said your are pursing medicine and plan to work part time? I’m not familiar with the medical industry, so I won’t pass professional judgment, but this strikes me as unusual; pursing a serious STEM degree, with huge financial and time invested- only to work part time? Some men, may see this as youthful naivety on your part or straight up less than honest. 

Thirdly, you say you want the man to pay the take care of you and the household, but as you may know, traditional men want traditional women (in the old fashioned sense). Personally, I’m telling you what I would tell you if you were my literal sister. Your facing the same struggle as many career driven Muslim women who come from traditional cultures, but still want traditional provider-type man, despite your unwillingness to give him want he wants- a homemaker & (full time) wife. No one “can have it all”. Life is a trade off, but you get to decide what is traded for what.

I hope my thoughts have benefited you in a own way. My beat at advice for you  is to;
 -join Somali networking groups and take things form there. 
-whilst mentioning what your doing, immediately mention how you want work part time in the future (can’t guarantee how serious he’ll take you though, honestly),
-Consider marrying an older man (5-10 years older). I’m serious walal.
-make your self more visible, in a halal way. You can’t afford not to send a pic (of you wearing an abaya). Don’t make it harder than it has to be.
- approach and talk to men, directly. Start of light and show your interest in him. If he’s the right one, he’ll ask for your number etc.. 
-speak to all the (decent) Somali women, you know, from the business owners to local aunties and gently let it be known your willing to look into any one they think could match you. 

Good luck with your studies and may you find a husband worthy of you and vice versa. 

If you want to talk further, DM me or message me back here- whatever works best for you. Peace.

Bro reread your last two comments. Moving on.

>I'm not interested. The problem comes in when they don't disclose and myself or another unsuspecting man doesn't know... What's your big issue about honesty.

I love how you're mad that trans people don't want to come out to you yet you refuse to also disclose that you're not interested in dating trans people, and then you complain about honesty. You can't make this up LMAO. Clown behavior at it's peak.

>they should disclose because which do you think will put them in more danger? Being upfront or waiting until later on when a man has been unsuspectingly talking and building a relationship with them? 

 Nobody is going to tell a person they just met their secrets and life story, whether it be trans or cis people. No it takes time and trust. Have you even dated? Been in a relationship? 🤨

If the guy sounds like a creep or says negative things about trans people don't you think that they wouldn't just stay and instead dip? Instead of saying it right at the get go and then get direct threats?

>Ah now it makes sense as to why you refuse to comprehend... You're trans so you have a personal interest in not disclosing your status because it narrows your dating pool and you're afraid of rejection. I get it. However that still doesn't give you the right to deceive folks by not disclosing once you see a straight man is interested.

>Smh.

I'm not trans, I'm cis but thanks💖 

And buddy, we can flip the switch on you. You're deceiving trans people because you didn't disclose that you're not interested in dating trans people.

"thebulwark","t5_29mg0r","“Mark Bauerlein, an Emory University English professor emeritus, is a senior editor at First Things, the Catholic magazine with strong “national conservative” leanings. Among his recent oeuvre: a hagiographic essay on “The Historical Meaning of Donald Trump” for the conspiracy-peddling Epoch Times and a tweet bemoaning Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s appearance in the U.S. Congress with a Ukrainian flag (a gift from Ukrainian frontline soldiers) as an assault on America’s civic integrity….. 

…..To give credit where it’s due: For all his Trumpiness, Bauerlein is a man who, by all appearances, genuinely cares about the humanities and the classical curriculum. This has brought him into apparent contradiction with Rufo. In an interview last week with the Herald-Tribune, Bauerlein said that drastic changes at the college are unlikely, that the existing students and tenured faculty would complicate any plans for a complete overhaul, and that a public university should have “a certain measure of pluralism” rather than a narrow political orientation. (Earlier this month, he also argued on Twitter that a classical education cannot be “right wing conservative” since it must include thinkers associated with the left, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche.) Bauerlein told the Herald-Tribune he is not even sure that New College can be entirely reinvented as a school of classical education, let alone a conservative one. He also wants to acquaint himself with the actual situation at the school before making conclusions about what changes are needed (what a concept!).
In the same interview, Bauerlein stressed that no one from DeSantis’s office told him how he was expected to vote and concluded that DeSantis and his team “want independent minds, they really do.”

I simply want you to let me know which parts are “fact free and bad faith”, simple request. Keep in mind those words mean a different thing than “an opinion or quote in an article that I disagree with”

Which of these words are founded in factual lies or  poisoning the discourse with disingenuous arguments and allowing “permission structures” ???

>During the times when the tobacco industry was discounting the risks of smoking and cancer, the phrase “doubt is our product” was purportedly part of their strategy. And within the climate change discussions, certain individuals have literally made careers out of waving “the uncertainty monster”. It has been used to argue that models are unreliable. It has been used to argue that measurements of global temperature, sea ice, etc. are unreliable. As long as you can spread enough doubt about the scientific results in the right places, you can delay action on climate concerns.

&#x200B;

>So, when a new paper comes along that claims that the entire climate science community has been doing it all wrong, and claims that the uncertainty in global temperature records is so large that “the 20th century surface air-temperature anomaly... does not convey any knowledge of rate or magnitude of change in the thermal state of the troposphere”, you can bet two things:

"HistoricalWhatIf","t5_2si7z","Model had consolidated the Ostfront within months of Bagration. They lost a lot of personnel and land, but the line was intact and still a ways from German border.

Germans war industry was nearly at it's best during the war. That lacked fuel but they were still pumping out tanks and other stuff efficiently. That area, the Ruhr, was also close to the sector being attacked by the western Allies, which further gave priority for a counter offensive.

Germany's manpower wasn't tapped out, they only fully tapped into it in July-August when they finally went to a absolute total war economy for the first time. In fact, in Sep-Dec the Heer was bolstered by half a million Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine personnel plus all those pulled into the service by the total war commitment, including a new age bracket previously untapped. Best of all, since so many of the army, corps, division command and staff had survived the worse of summer 1944, they could use them to rebuild around, which is how the ""Miracle of the West"" was accomplished and how Germany managed to build a gigantic reserve to counterattack while Allied intelligence thought like you did, that they were tapped out.

The Germans had over 50 infantry divisions and over 20 panzer or panzer grenadier divisions in OB West by Dec 44. Had Autumn Mist worked as planned they could have moved nearly all the mobile divisions and many of the Infantry divisions each just in time to stop the Vistula Oder offensive in it's tracks. Instead, they moved only small part of those units (the rest were still needed to stabilize the line during counterattacks or had been battered during the actual battle and needed to be rebuilt).

Ultimately this would delayed the war long enough for Germany to eat a nuke, but nobody knew that in Dec 1944.",1693526449.0

Not trying to hate on the op, by the way. She’s made a fantastic transformation and I’ll use her as an example. She is morbidly obese in the first picture before her weight loss, objectively. 

I never said a word about bmis. It is *very* rare that someone has a genuine condition where they can’t lose weight. Sure, everybody has different metabolic rates, which influences their weight, but caloric intake also influences weight. No regular person has an inherent amount of **excess* fat that has to remain on their body in order to survive. It is ludicrous to say otherwise, against what we know to be a medical fact. Being overweight, obese, and morbidly obese is indisputably unhealthy. Now whether a metric is provided for how unhealthy being overweight is not the conversation that’s happening. 

I’ve seen overweight cross fitters who choose to be overweight. They’re healthy in terms of their movement and their lifestyle. They’re fantastic individuals; however, their weight contributes to an unhealthy component of their lives. Denying that further misconstrues what health is, which is not a subjective opinion. I know (and have been one myself) chronic cannabis users who use the substance to go to the gym. I was healthy, but I also had an unhealthy component contributing to my life via smoking.

Peat is an above median performance guard. He's inconsistent and injury prone. He's not bad, just not available enough.

Davenport is a bust. He wasn't and won't ever be the guy we drafted him to be, which was the guy that would eventually become that guy after cam hung them up. He didn't.

"Starfield","t5_3g41m","Game review scores are pretty inflated in general, stuff like COD also regularly gets 9/10. For context Deathloop is currently also sitting at 88; clearly a fun game, but hardly 'amazing' and basically every review criticised it for handholding too much.

Remember that reviewers are incentivised to give high scores so they keep being given early access; even a 7/10 is probably more like a 5 or 6 in the reviewer's experience, just too controversial to mark down further.

So yeah, 88... great, not amazing. But Starfield will have more mod potential than anything out there so it's going to mature fantastically",1693526450.0

2. Try to hide it forever. Go your entire life hoping your affair partner won't tell your husband. Either, one of you will slip and confess, or the guilt you feel will drive a wedge between you and your husband because you won't open up and you'll divorce anyway.

All you have to do at the end of the day is end up with a greater threat than your opponent, which is just too easily achievable playing an instant/counter focused mono blue deck. Because the creatures become so cheap compared to the mana you have, it becomes cake to simultaneously protect those creatures from any removal with just more counter spells.

At that point, everything can be read to us, and we can dictate any written communication.  AI will be prevalent, and three might even be a living wage for those who choose to stay at home.

I’m going YTA because I don’t find it appropriate for a woman to cry to a married man over her relationship troubles especially when she knows it makes his wife uncomfortable. It definitely sounds like this was more than just a casual friendship. I don’t tell my husband what to do or who he can see but everyone has boundaries and it’s okay to uphold them. Perhaps you were just incompatible because your boundaries are not the same.

So yes, I absolutely understand the pressure to get this right and how overwhelming it can feel (cause who knew the English language was so complicated?!)

If you are struggling with your toddler, you should be reaching out for professional speech therapy. Kids without speech delays just soak up language (like your 6 year old). It might be that your toddler needs some extra help. The earlier you get them that extra help the better. Don't be like me and just wait until there is no denying that there is a problem.

I've been trying (key word being trying) to focus on a play activity where I can practice speech with my 4 year old at least once a day. Just 10-30 minutes. Playdoh. Playing with dolls. Even cooking with your kid and letting them label ingredients. These are all great ways to get them engaged in something and talking. It's really hard sometimes to think of the right activities. Other times my daughter will just randomly find something interesting and we'll talk about it. I try to narrate in super simple sentences (or sometimes just labeling) as much as possible. Always keep in mind that before a child can use a word they need to understand it. So focus on helping them understand the meaning of words first with lots of repetition vs making them say words before they understand what they are saying.",1693526454.0

They seem to have completely changed their strategy on how to make money. They still sell software, but they seem to have lost interest to lock people into technologies. Instead they seem to lock people in services and are probably making money elsewhere, in analytics, marketing and so on. Don't get me wrong, selling software is still a big income for them, but seems like they are shifting from selling tools and locking people into Windows platform with their technologies. 

Just a week ago I have discovered [Avalonia UI](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/). Honestly, I had no idea about it; I was looking for a win32 bindings for Common Lisp and wanted to generate those automatically. I am aware of SWIG but I never really liked it. One thing led me to another, so I found xlang, which led me to winmd which is some binary format of theirs they use to export different windows APIs to so one can generate native calls from different languages. Then there was a link to some tool that could open this format, and the github mentioned Linux. I was first whaaaat, GUI app from Microsoft for Linux??? :-) Than I tried it, and it worked.

"giftcardexchange","t5_2s989","Hello, by trading here you agree that your post follows all of the [**GCX Rules**](https://www.reddit.com/r/giftcardexchange/wiki/rules). If you have not read these, stop and do so now. Here's a condensed list that is absolutely essential to read before you move any further.

* Rule 1: DO NOT accept PMs without a public comment on GCX! Open your post and ensure you can see the comment. If you can't, don't engage with the user as they may be attempting to trick you by disguising a PM as a public comment. Was your post removed and someone immediately sent you a private message? Don't talk with them! Search the [**Universal Scammer List**](https://universalscammerlist.com/). Did you receive a PM from modmail saying you can't sell the gift card on the sub, but you can sell it to the mod team? This is a scam! The mods of /r/giftcardexchange will never offer this ""service"" or ask you to reveal gift card information! Click on the sub name - it's likely a private sub named ""gitfcardexchange"" or ""giftcardexcharge"" attempting to impersonate the real /r/giftcardexchange.
* Rule 2: Investigate your trading partner! Is the account very inactive? Did they just become active and immediately start posting on trade subs? Are they trying to direct you off of Reddit to another site? These are red flags! Double check any links you're sent and ensure they aren't leading to a different domain outside of Reddit.
* Rules 4 and 5: Are you attempting to trade an account balance such as Amazon gift card balance over $250 in value? Are you attempting to trade a single gift card or multiple gift cards over $250 in value? Stop and see the appropriate rule and send in the form to modmail, otherwise your post will be removed and you'll receive an infraction.
* Rule 6: Do you have a prepaid card such as Visa? These cannot be traded for cash equivalents such as PayPal here! GCX is for trading gift cards - see /r/Cash4Cash if it is more appropriate.
* Rule 11: Are you selling a gift card? If you're a ``GCX Beginner`` you can only ask for PayPal Goods & Services! Asking for any other payment method (not including gift cards) will lead to a post removal.

"recruitinghell","t5_3bwcw","I did not do the college route. I went straight into the workforce as a highschool dropout and earned my positions through merit.

Many of my friends who went to college are working low wage jobs that require no higher education because they cant find work, and here I am, with experience, working in my preferred career with title, position, and pay to match and no higher education required.

You're going to have to take a knee and accept a lower position, then work your way into your goal position.

Once you have that initial experience out of the way, it becomes a lot easier to walk in and grab a job you want.

In my experience, they can accept me, the person who has experience working in content with proven history of doing so, or they can accept the person who just got out of college.

Private business isn't illegal in Norway, but I don't think private business needs to be illegal for a country to be less than ""far from a socialist \[market\] economy"". Especially if you consider countries like Venezuela, Cuba, or North Korea to be socialist!

>Not going to off of a blog with data from 2012.

It's a thinktank.

&#x200B;

>The US State Department writes;  
...

Yes, and then the next sentences are:

""The Norwegian government is the largest owner in Norway, with ownership stakes in a range of key sectors (e.g., energy, transportation, finance, and communications). Seventy-one State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) are managed directly by the relevant government ministries, and approximately 33 percent of the stock exchange’s capitalization is in government hands. The Norwegian state owns assets worth approximately NOK 1,179 billion ($112 billion), through diverse companies that employ more than 300,000 people.""

>Yea, so the way they get to 66%, is via taxes, right? It's not that those 70 companies are producing 66% of their GDP, it's that the government collects massive taxes, and then spends it on government services.  


Sure. But about third of the people of Norway work for the government.

>Furthermore, if you look at the companies listed; they are in the following sectors; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_government\_enterprises\_of\_Norway  
  
...  
  
So, these are just government infrastructure for the most part, not actual corporations, and explains why I've never seen a product that says ""Made in Norway"", nor heard of any of these companies.

Not really sure what argument you're making here? Some kinds of companies are better suited for being SOEs than others, that's true. But I don't know what it means to not be an ""actual corporation"", and I don't know what your level of prior familiarity with these companies is supposed to do for me. Do you know much about other Norwegian companies that aren't government owned, or something?

>Not as socialist as Cuba, North Korea or Venezuela, but yea it's probably fourth. But, that said, it's not even close to being socialist when all other industry they have is privately owned and operated. Other than ""Theater and Entertainment"" these are typical things governments do.

What makes these countries more socialist than Norway? Other than that, you know, socialism is bad and those countries are doing poorly and Norway isn't.

For in Christianity Christ is not gone but remains an ever present spiritual being like God and the Holy Spirit. 

Where as if you just follow the teachings then the man himself is no longer necessary to your reasoning.  For instance Karl Marx lived, created the Communist Manifesto, and then died. His teachings and their impact are what people remember about him. The man himself is irrelevant at this time because he is gone. Without belief in the divine aspects of Christ he is simply another man who had an incredible impact on humanity as a whole. Certainly a path you can follow but one tied to your own moral reasoning about humanity. That is not a measure of belief but a conscious judgment on how you think the world should be.

1 John 4:16 And so we know and rely on the love God has for us.  **God is love.** Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in them. 17 This is how love is made complete among us so that we will have confidence on the day of judgment: In this world we are like Jesus. 

If you raise your kids to be like his Son, then you are raising them to be Love.  

On the other hand, if you want to be genuine, then learn what God is.  **When seeking God, the one you are looking for is the one looking.**  

Do you possess consciousness?  Yes.  Then you are using God to see, yet you do not realize what sees.  

1 Corinthians 13

 12 For now we see **only a reflection as in a mirror**; then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.

Break it down.  You are known (by God), but you do not know God until completion comes.  How do I know?

Same chapter:

 9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10 **but when completeness comes**, what is in part disappears. 11 When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put the ways of childhood behind me.

We are all children and we do not fully know God (the one we use to see), but God knows us (Known fully, as it states above).  We see from a dimly lit reflect, as in a mirror.  

You know God well.  You just forgot where to look.  

What else might you find by study of all religions?  Just this same truth reflecting again and again.  That's the mystery of interbeing.

Why does Buck have to explain to this virtual stranger the fact that he had a life before meeting her?

"IronThroneRP","t5_345ny","> *_Before the feast..._*

Shireen gazed into her reflection in the nigh-shimmering steel of her helm, meeting her own uncertain gaze. For the very first time in her five years of service, she felt the weight of her white cloak upon her shoulders, the shield encumbering her arms, and the poleaxe tucked beneath her belt. 

Riverrun! Why was it Riverrun? So close, yet so far from home, if that little village by the ford could still stand after so much time. But it was not the young and scared little girl that gazed into the waters of the Trident so many years ago, but a _knight_. A _Kingsguard_. She was not just a fisherman's daughter, she was _Shireen of the Ruby Ford_, and the world had been _taught_ her name. 

She lowered her helmet over her head. 

""I am sworn to obey his commands, to keep his secrets, to counsel him or keep my silence, to defend his name and honor,"" she spoke softly to herself. 

She was one of the seven most brave and dangerous warriors in all the Seven Kingdoms and beyond. There was no room for doubt. Only the certainty of steel.

And even as the old king lived and breathed, danger already bubbled beneath the surface of calm...

---

> *During the feast...*

Shireen stood vigilant in the King's shadow. Her armor had been ruthlessly polished until the white enamel was pale as snow, and not a link of chain or cord of leather was out of place. A round shield braced her arm, as her other cradled the long oaken haft of her chosen poleaxe. She cut a heroic statue, calm and diligent. 

As nobles talked, laughed, danced, and glutted upon foods so spicy, sweet, fragrant, and decadent that her peasant palette could not begin to abide, she thought not of merriment or sustenance, piquing her idle mind with over a hundred scenarios of possible and impossible attack and her imaginary retaliations.

She had guarded a lioness, she had watched over a she-wolf, yet this old man had more foes than both combined, but none would be so bold to strike out while she was on her guard.",1693526459.0

"sex","t5_2qh3p","> extremely high odds that you will get into a long-term sexual relationship where you don't have to stress about the availability of sex, where you can assume (and be right in your assumption) that even if you don't have it with your partner today, you'll still have it tomorrow.

What about people who by default have a small potential dating pool due to a combination of reasons? For me personally (I'm 20 and studying in uni btw), they're as follows:

1/ I live in a small country in a severe demographic crisis (extremely aging population due to low birth rates and high emigration rates) with a population of 6.5M, of which only 440k are women aged 16-30. My country has an area of 110k square kilometers. For comparison, let's take the massive metropolitan city New York - it has a population of 8.5M, of which 940k are women in the same age range, spread over an area of 0.8k square kilometers. 135 times smaller area, more than twice the sheer amount of women, so overall close to 300 times better dating prospects for the average New Yorker compared to someone in my country

2/ my interests/hobbies/passions/personality severely shrink the dating pool. Firstly, I have been a hardcore metalhead for 6 years now - I listen to music every day, I attend every concert/show/festival possible, I wear band merch all the time (t-shirts and hoodies). I simply would not be compatible with someone who at the very least cannot tolerate my lifestyle - it's honestly fine if I connect with a woman over something else and she's not an active part of this lifestyle **as long as she respects and supports me in maintaining it**. Even with that caveat,  where I live I doubt more than 10% of women would fit that. Down to 44k.

Secondly, still to that - I am very likely to have undiagnosed ADHD. Which means that I can be quite forgetful/distracted/oblivious to things that would be obvious for the average person. For example, I remember this situation - my mother had sent me to the nearby supermarket to buy something that I had never bought before. So I didn't know where exactly to find it within the market itself (there are a lot of shelves). I asked my mother, she told me before I went and when I arrived I had forgotten exactly what she told me - I was only in the general vicinity of the shelves she'd told me about. So I call her, she specifies again, so I move to the exact shelf she told me about... and I still did not see it. It was literally in front of my eyes and within my eyesight, my brain simply did not register it. I even started recording while passing along the shelf explaining that it seems that the supermarket has none in store left. I must have passed by it SEVERAL times without being able to pick it out. So I confidently come home, show my mother the recording... and she literally pinpointed it in the video itself 🫠🤦‍♂️ So I went again to actually buy it (this time without any troubles). Why do I describe this? Well, how many women do you think they would tolerate this on a consistent basis? I definitely will need a lot of reminders for responsibilities I'd have cuz I'd simply forget them, or if it's something new that I have never done I'd need instructions/guidance. I can't put an estimated number here but for sure many wouldn't be fine with this long-term

3/ looks - I'm average at best. Below average height (5'8""), overweight (183 lbs) although not inactive - like I can walk or cycle 10-12 km in a day (or even a combination, e.g. walk 5 during the day and cycle 10 in the night). I'm growing out a long hair since with short hair I literally look like I'm 16 or younger, still having a lot more of the sweet/cutesy type of look instead of the more ""masculine"" one. Idk for how many this would be a hurdle for no attraction to ever occur but I assume it would again be far from few

4/ are they single? That would imo filter out at least half, if not up to 60-70% of women

5/ even if I do end up in the same concert with one, will circumstances even allow for a conversation to occur? It may often happen that someone with whom we would be compatible on paper if we got to know each other, for her to just not feel like talking at the time, or that she's a part of a group that I cannot join (e.g. if they're talking about a topic only they know about, for example a shared memory or discussing someone they all know but isn't there, or overall any topic I wouldn't be able to talk about and thus join them; background music while no band is playing may even be too loud to overhear what they're actually talking about, etc.)

All in all... it doesn't look promising in the slightest, does it? In the 10 months I've been socializing in by going to concerts/shows, I had like 4 more major interactions - one actually is still my best friend, and was on my very first concert out of time, it felt and still feels like 1 in a million since cold approaching a stranger ever since has been not even close to as successful (and honestly, things could have progressed to a relationship with her if she had known my intentions earlier - which I didn't verbalize because I assumed it was clear by our behavior, and she was absolutely overwhelmed by uni schedule and life as a whole, up to the point of her physically collapsing during the exam session due to sleep deprivation. So verbalizing my interest would have occupied space in her brain when she absolutely couldn't have handled anything else going in her mind and life). The second was a girl that I met via common friends (girl 1 introduced me to a massive metalhead friend group in the capital), she was impressed by my harsh vocals and was like ""dude, are you in a black metal band or sth?"" - I'm not, I've just been practicing for long. Well, she lives 150 km away so I decided to try to text instead of burning money on fuel + the dates themselves (since I drive to the capital for concerts weekly/every 2-3 weeks anyway), the convo died out after a week. The third was a cold approach in the local bar, conversation got sexual over text, turned out she's lesbian. The 4th and most recent, conversation died out after like the 4th concert we attended (I was driving us around)",1693526459.0

"singularity","t5_2qh8m","Tl Dr, You are being foolish and emotional. It is one thing to be anticapitalist anarchist, which I am, but you have to realize that not everywhere is going to be a neoliberal dystopia merely because America is becoming a neoliberal dystopia and western countries having influence is not going to change that. Consider the fact that Germany, one of Europe's most powerful economies, has codetermination policies, which make it is so that workers can have a percentage of the vote in companies, and they essentially have a program where workers in a company can have unions within the company which exert influence on the company.   

This is very different from US policies. Consider that Switzerland has a canton based direct democracy which is more active than America's ballot initiatives and an effective community currency system for smaller businesses. Norway's oil wealth is in a fund whose goal is to benefit it's citizens, it could have chosen to be like Saudi Arabia, but it did not. Different places have different social technologies and values which create different distributions of power. That is how the real world works, it is complex and diverse. There is no good reason for this to change in the singularity, in fact there is a good reason to think it would get more complex and more diverse.

___

>holy shit you dont even know how the saudi family came to power do you?

They came to power by making alliances with western nations, then they used alliances with the west to get the technology necessary to harness oil, today they have the power to control how much oil they produce and how much it costs, regardless of what the west wants. The west  did not go there and conquer the  place,  and then install proxies , if they did they would not have the House of Saud deciding on how much oil costs in ways that harm their economies, which is why I say not really. 

>my point has only ever been about developing nations only being allowed to do what capitalists allow them

 Your prediction was this.

""There will not be good and bad places if we continue where we are going. There will be one good place where the billionaires and certain members of their families live.""


My argument always has been that different distributions of power would lead to different outcomes for different nations and polities in the future.

Your counter seems to logically imply that western capitalists would actively prevent there from being different outcomes in different countries, **which is not factual**. Again, there is a reason why Norway is different from Saudi Arabia. You seem to be one of the people that implicitly think that America is the world, that every where is going to be a neoliberal dystopia because America has become a neoliberal dystopia. If this were true, we would not have places like the Nordic countries and Germany with its codetermination laws. Even in America, we have places like Alaska where oil wealth is distributed as a kind of UBI. If you actually did a course on the difference between countries and their polities, you would notice how different everything actually is.


You think you are being wise by being cynical and ideological, but you cynicism has made you foolish and ignorant. 

Actually look at what the world is like, and the most essential thing you are going to learn is that it is complex and diverse. I am personally an anti capitalist and anarcho socialist, and yet I realize this. Bad things happen in some places and good things happen in some places. The idea that everywhere is going to be a  bad place is a prediction that has never come true ever. There is no good reason to assume that something has changed so greatly that it would become true in the future.

AI, brings more power into the world, yes, so Billionaires can become rulers of entire planets, that is not ideal but so be it. This does not imply that everywhere is going to be bad for the average person anymore than it was during feudalism.",1693526459.0

"redscarepod","t5_hq6n1","Deliberately massacring civilians: No.

Civilians getting caught in crossfire: Yes.

Ukraine's intelligence only sharpened up this year. They were caught blindsided as much as the rest of the world was when Russian invaded. This meant no proper evacuation of civilians, and so they got caught in fights when they should have been evacuated. This is no longer a problem anymore, their systems are more robust, thus it is exceedingly rare for civilians to get caught in these fights. 

The infamous example is the ""Izyum mass graves"", and similar stories. Basically, the Russian invasion of Izyum caught the Ukrainian military on its backfoot. They had no time to evacuate the area, many civilians got caught in the crossfire, typically from artillery and guided missiles that got intercepted in the air.

Both Russia and Ukraine lacked adequate resources to handle these bodies, so even when Russia informed the Ukrainian government about it, there was little they could do. So what did the Russians do? They tried to give them proper burials before leaving Izyium. ""Tried"" is the keyword because, lacking proper manpower and time, they had to stack some bodies in the same grave, typically Ukrainian soldiers.",1693526459

"ADHDPartners","t5_3mlce3","As for me: the CPTSD was with both girlfriends who dumped me. 

The first was because she realized she needed and valued consistency in her relationship due to having wildly erratic parents with mental health issues. Therefore, dogged determination (on my part) to try and maintain consistency was not and would never be enough for her. She needed a mate for whom consistency came naturally. 

The second was because she’d been married to a man with undiagnosed cases of severe ADHD *and* bipolar I for fifteen years. 
That my ADHD was mild was irrelevant; it was that I had ADHD to begin with, that was the problem for her. She literally could not continue in our relationship due to the constant panic attacks she was developing. She could not date me, go to therapy, and live a normal life all at the same time. 

That happens; it’s heartbreaking but the person with ADHD has to understand that we come with a lot of social baggage. And not everyone is able to handle that.",1693526459

And if that happens we’re all fucked lmao",1693526460.0

"buildapcforme","t5_2tjcr","You might actually want 64gb of RAM, it really depends on if you have intentions on going into professional level Unreal use which really, really wants 64gb of RAM. For most people 32 is plenty though.

12600k gets better performance then the 5700x for unreal and only asks for a 20 dollar more expensive motherboard in terms of cost. It even has an ok upgrade path if you ever decide to upgrade the CPU in socket.

If you're doing a bunch of 3d asset creation then nvidia just kind of wins in terms of rendering speeds still, but if you're going more casual then a 6800xt saves about 100 bucks and gets extremely similar performance in games outside of RT.

If you want to get it to 1000 find a used 3080. They tend to be right around 400 bucks now and offer the same performance for higher power use.

Just disclaimer that I only played Seldarine and halfway through act3.

I think being a Drow already get you some pretty mean choices without having to be a Loth-sworn, and game has general choice for you to be a bastard either way, so on the roleplaying point it's pretty flexible.

But I think I remember Loth-sworn have some extra mean choices and pretty cool interactions, so if you wanna go full bastard ""I am superior"" then Loth-sworn would have more options, I think.

On your character's backstory part, I honestly don't think the Drow subraces are races, it's really just Loth worshippers and non-loth worshippers, as far as in know in-game, in both Loth-sworn and Seldarine, matriarchy still big culture for drow that shaped both society, so if he gets fed up with it and go to surface, I think it still works with both.",1693526461.0

I have a lot of clients that came to me because they got tired of getting people from those apps that they end up not taking care of their pets properly. 

I also have been able to offer more than most businesses by my motto, ""Be the change you want to see."" when grooming, I always do a free ear cleaning and perfume spritz rather than up charging for it like every other business. it takes no time and cost me pennies. I also blow off the dogs after a hair cut rather than give them back with tiny hairs everywhere. Those small differences go a very long way.

I am very transparent and dont hide anything including price points. I make it easy for clients to make educated decisions. 

I am good with communicating immediately to requests. I also track everyone to know when I should reach back out. 

another advantage i have is making friends with competing businesses.I get a lot of referrals that way as well. usually when it's a service they don't offer or it's outside their service area. most people only stay in very small areas while i service the entire city and surrounding areas. They also refer to us when they can't meet a scheduling need. I always find a way to make it work for the customers schedule.

I give back to the community by donating our time to help locate lost pets. I throw fundraising events to donate toward non-profits like the Humaine Society. I also put aside funds to help put toward grooming or care for pets that people otherwise couldn't afford. 

combining everything puts my business well above everyone else and has created traction. We have won multiple awards and have been voted into the top 3 pet services in my city being beat only by the Humane Society and No More Homeless Pets, both of which are large scale non-profits.",1693526462.0

"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx","I disagree with every point you made, however to keep this from becoming a book i will only tackle your first point. 

First off you don't understand the meanings of the terms I am using. I am a Marxist Lenninist, which is one type of communism. It is far from being the only type of communism. There are many more. 

Socialism as defined by ML is a transitionary period between Capitalism and Communism. The predominant type of socialism preferred by ML is State Capitalism. 

State Capitalism is defined as a system in which all capital goods are controlled by the state (Either directly or indirectly) in order to supercede Capital's inherent tendency to take concessions back from the working class after they are won. The CPC (The Communist Party of China is the correct name, saying Chinese Communist Party is incorrect) assumes ultimate power over capital with the direct interest of transitioning to Communism. Communism is defined as when the barrier between the capitalist class and the working class dissolves, so that workers own the labor they do instead of shareholders, governments, CEOs, etc. 

China never went through the Renaissance and was still in feudalism up until the reds won in 1950.Under this transitionary phase, we have seen a rise in living standards at a rate unheard of in human history. Understand that this was  a country that started out economically the same as Africa. As of right now they still don't have as high of a living standards as us, but that gap becomes narrower and narrower each year. 

They will surpass the west in living standards within our lifetime. Once that is complete, and I am quoting this directly from the party, they will have completed their primary contradiction and change it towards eroding the barrier between the working class and the capitalist class so the workers will own the work they do.",1693526462.0

1. a^2 + b^2 = c^2 

2. x^2 + y^2 = z^2

3. (a+x)^2 + (b+y)^2 = (c+z)^2

Expanding 3, we get

3a. a^2 + 2ax + x^2 + b^2 + 2by + y^2 = c^2 + 2cz + z^2

By substituting 1. And 2. Into 3a, we can cancel all single variable terms, and get:

I worry that it’ll be confusing to also have a grandfather called Papa, so I’m trying to find alternatives that I can propose to my father-in-law.

He doesn’t have any cultural/linguistic ties that would give him options outside of English norms; he comes from a Jewish Polish/Russian family, but he’d already lost ties to that culture growing up, so he wouldn’t want to go by any Jewish names for grandpa, for example.

Says who? For anyone building, developing, renovating, or managing real estate, the purpose is to make money.  There you go ASSUMING a point instead of having one, again.

> there are SEVERAL cities both globally and within Canada that are actively updating laws to regulate the industry

""I found these other people doing this thing I like so that makes it good!"" ""SEVERAL""?! Out of how many thousands or tens of thousands of cities *globally*? 

""Other people do it so that makes it ok"" has never been an argument that anyone should take seriously. So, in case you're having trouble keeping up, you shouldn't do that.

> Laws that are in place to address housing shortages,

Name. ONE. One law that's in place ""to address housing shortages"".

Ap wise he can take out a trash Burgles with no haki? Impressive if this was still east blue and not post Wano


Again feats wise he has nothing going for him and he gets one shot by any YC.

"Watercolor","t5_2td8l","It's true that you can mitigate paper issues by sticking to dry brushing. At that point, however, you should ask yourself why you are choosing to learn *water*color. I suggest gouache instead since you can to a greater degree make use of cheaper mixed media pulp paper. And since gouache is in a sense heavier body watercolor, in the future, you can choose to move to watercolor paint and better paper. Gouache might also be easier to learn since technique wise. Something to consider if you aren't fixed on learning watercolor.

You can try some mixed cotton pulp watercolor paper. Fabriano has some such mixed cotton paper in a few of their product lines. You can buy something like the Fabriano watercolor ""fat pad"", which is a lot of sheets for the money. You still don't want to try doing very wet washes, as it just won't hold up, but at least it's workable to a degree.

For brushes, don't approach them the same way you buy acrylic or oil brushes. The primary shape is a round, and that's what you should begin with. Variations on this (mops, liners) can also be used, but I wouldn't tell a beginner to worry about filberts or swords or anything else. Beginners have a tendency to worry about shape, which is funny, because the real problem is size. Don't undersize your brush.",1693526464.0

Do you have any CBD? I find taking a large dose of CBD really helpful.  


Try looking up a calm/gentle yoga video on youtube that you can follow along with to help you get out of your head and into your body.   


I had auditory hallucinations once from weed and I had never experienced that before. It initially spooked me and then I actually started interacting with the sounds, to help me feel safer/more in control. I pretended the sounds were just people or friendly ghosts and I was like ""hey! thanks for being friendly. we can all co-exist here"", talking out loud to them... I was washing the dishes and when I heard something I would be like ""hey, thanks for keeping my company while i do the dishes"" haha....  they didn't respond back so I think it made me able to feel safer, like, it really was just the drugs causing my brain to hear sounds.

Remember:   


""This is drugs. I have been on drugs before. This will pass""  


""Even though this isn't my usual response to weed, it makes sense that something is different this time because my circumstances are different. I have a real major stressor in my life right now.

"lostarkgame","t5_34jq7","> Gatekeeping (to the extent it is even a thing)  

Gatekeeping is very real and exists everywhere. In lost ark, or real life. Being in denial of it is complete stupidity. Maybe you are someone who lives on the very definition of nepotism. You don't need to worry about getting a job in real life because your parents have all the connections. Similarly, you don't need to worry about PF because you have friends that can carry every single alt of yours. But i can assure you, not everybody wants or is fortunate enough to be in that circumstance. 

> Therefore you are being denied for other reasons that would not fall under gatekeeping.  

This is true. But as the gatekept. I do not know the reason. All I know is that I'm applying for 30 minutes and being denied with a perfectly fine profile that arguably you would accept. Why being gatekept defined by the gatekeeper and not the gatekept? Do people not realise how stupid it would be if poverty is defined by the rich and not the people actually in poverty? 

Just FYI, I don't think gatekeeping is a bad thing. It's perfectly natural. The fundamental core problem, especially in this game is the fact that so many people expect free and undeserved carries. Especially supports. How many times have I seen a minimum ilevel support gatekeeping for people with investments triple or quadruple theirs? 

There are SO many fucking people trying to get free carried on their alts to the point they don't really learn how to play their class. Then you end up with runs where the 1540 support gatekeeping for 1580s can't even maintain a 50% brand uptime. The 1540 DPS gets out dps'd by the 1500 because they can't play. Other people see this and start gatekeeping harder because ""damn, 1540DPS does zdps, I need to gatekeep for 1560s now which further reinforces the issue of gatekeeping. 

Now you see the problem?",1693526467.0

 Some animations are long and lock you out of things (Im looking at you Q). Using E to both end W and as the actually ability itself feels unintuitive to use because you have to constantly asses the likely hood of you W within its CD. E by itself is mostly just good in bushes otherwise it gives people please of time to just leave its range. Have what is essentially Sion Q on an otherwise fast paced rush down champ ends up feeling out of place and bad to use becuase you are rarely in a position charge it and even when you do and you even get a stun on someone it basically disables your W because of how easy it is to punish it when E is on CD. Her ult might look like it have Global Range and is super exciting but is so easy to dodge even by just walking and any champ with a movement ability or flash up will dodge unless they are already CC chained. R and W feel very punishable to use if you don't have E up and given she is rather limited without W it just becomes a game of force E on CD and if she Ws again punish her to high hell. Completely control free also doesn't feel super good imo because the game basically plays itself and shes a complete feast or famine champ and when you get fed the game devolves into walk around Q W wait till they are low W2 leading to an unenjoyably simple playstyle of press the win fight button and taking back any agency to dodge a skillshot or whatever punishes you. She feels statchecky and obnoxiously so towards the end where the game is unplayable if you get behind and boringly easy when you snowball in to an item or two. Using her kit feels very unskillful and it sorta of is at least in the combo sense she just basically needs you to know when to press W and when its a bad idea. I imagine she will join the likes of Yorick and Illaoi as the bane of Silver players' existance.

Fingers crossed a few more games change my mind because I really want to like her but she is just boringly simple aside from when to use W or not and that ends up feeling less like actual skill and more like pure knowledge checking.",1693526467.0

I'm gonna get downvoted for this. 

While changing the oil yesterday, I needed a container to pour the dirty oil into and I didn't want to waste the remaining oil left in the 5 quart jug of oil so I quickly poured it into a Dasani water bottle I had in my trunk but forgot to empty it fully.

I set the bottle on the floor by the car before I started the oil change so in that time I totally forgot that there was 3-4 oz of water max, might have actually been less. In that time with my really poor short term memory I forgot about the water while quickly pouring out the new left over oil in it. 

Next day I change the filter and top it off with the same bottle and it looked clean till I saw the bottom of the bottle had some milky white oil sludge like a tiny bit which not all went in the crank case.",1693526468.0

If the answer is going to be no, then they’ve got nothing to lose. More importantly, the information that it wasn’t received well is irrelevant because you’re not going to be a customer, and this ask isn’t *why* you said no, and you’re not going to recommend them anyway. So It’s a bit like driving past a gas station you’re not going to stop at and and shouting “I don’t like your gas station”. Yeah, it’s annoying but definitely just roll your eyes and move on. In fact, the old sales adage, “if they’re still talking to you then they haven’t really said no yet” probably applies here, and they’ll probably keep pressing against your objections.",1693526468.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","I’m transgender myself and you are definitely NTA. 

It sounds like she desperately wants a daughter and is jumping at the minuscule possibility that he is transgender. He can play with whatever he wants and still be a boy. He doesn’t need to be a girl to do “girl” things, and your wife needs to realize that. As a psychologist she SHOULD know that. I didn’t need a psychologist to ask if I was a boy or a girl to realize that I am not a girl. 

While I don’t think the topic of gender identity is inappropriate for his age, it’s unnecessary to ask if he feels like one or the other if he’s never started the conversation himself. 

Make sure your wife knows that you’re not opposed to the idea because of prejudice. That could be what’s leading her to think that you “don’t care about his mental health.” 

Any sort of change as far as gender should be initiated by the kid, not pushed by a parent with preconceived notions.",1693526468.0

Sorry if this comes as rude (it probably does considering how you've felt about the comments before mine), but I just think the line of thinking you have here, while most likely accurate, is also in bad faith. Not towards the other people that you're telling not to try to give advice, but towards yourself. Sure, you probably have heard and tried everything imaginable, and I'm truly sorry you haven't found a viable solution. But there could be someone or something that could solve it, sometime down the line, and it might not cross your radar.

I'll reverse the thought process fire fighters/law enforcement agencies have about fake calls, which is ""we'd rather receive a 100 fake prank calls, than miss out on one legitimate issue"". I would hate for you to miss out on a potential solution sometime down the line, just because you do not want to hear a suggestion multiple times.

"canon","t5_2qi07","RF-S 18-150 works very well on the R7, nicely sharp for a kit lens and incredibly versatile. I've got a bunch of specialist lenses I often take with my on hikes but aside from dedicated birding, most of the time the 18-150 is good enough to not make switching lenses worth the effort; it's also incredibly stable in conjunction with the R7's IBIS. I was also not expecting to appreciate the lightweight nature of the combo as much as I do; EF(S) lenses plus the adapter are much heavier.

I find it works quite nicely for landscapes too (the lens is actually sharpest at 18mm), HOWEVER you may live in an area where the extra FOV is more useful. Worst comes to worst though, you could always stitch a wider scene post process, or use the in-camera panorama feature.",1693526469.0

I have seen people make posts about crashing systems. I assume they are bad hardware. Bad CPUs, etc. They should be returned/replaced. 

When you get a new system (any new system), I would recommend stress-testing it anyway you can. Start loading the most demanding games you can. Overclock it, if possible. Test all features & hardware (USB, networking, headphone jack, etc.). 

It also depends on your OS. I've mostly ran stripped-down mini-Linux installs with limited functionality on my RG35XX.  Running something closer to a full OS install (like ArkOS) could have more things that could cause problems.",1693526470.0

"Animemes","t5_2w6fe","Greetings Animemes.

This post is a bit out of the blue, but we've been meaning to issue an event of this nature for years. One of the big problems users and fellow moderators on the team kept noticing throughout the history of r/animemes has always been ""Horny Posting"". These memes are typically focused solely on appealing to the sexual desires of users for their joke and/or content. And frankly, many people have found them to be lacking in humor or meaning, aside from the horny, and wish to see them removed.

However, there is also a large group of users on r/animemes who think that horny memes are perfectly fine, and would like to continue to enjoy and/or create horny memes.

After internal discussion within the team, we have come to the conclusion that we should try and see what kind of ruleset we can create that would balance out those who wish to see horny memes completely banned and those who wish to continue to see and/or make them.

We are planning on rolling out multiple definitions throughout the entire month of September to see what constitutes as a ""bad horny meme"", memes that have outlived their time in the sun and have become too stale for a majority of users to find worthwhile.

Let us make this clear, THIS IS NOT A BAN. Or at least, not a permanent one. We plan on testing each definition for a 5 day period, with feedback between each testing period to evaluate the definition's effectiveness. 
Below is a comprehensive list of the definitions that we will be testing:

* Definition 1: Posts that prominently display sexualized art as their primary focus and/or joke are considered insubstantial edits of the original media.

* Definition 2: Posts where the main focus is on sexually suggestive content, and not in regards to the attempted joke or punchline, are not allowed.

* Definition 3: Posts where the main joke or interaction is highly sexual in nature, or where the imagery is excessively lewd, are not allowed.

* Definition 4:
boobs and a funny ✅ 
boobs and no funny ❌
boobs are the funny ❌

As for the testing times, generally speaking, every Monday UTC 00:00 we will be switching over to a new defintion (1st week is 1st definition, 2nd week is 2nd definition, etc) and every Saturday UTC 00:00 we will be ending the testing period of that definition, with a 2 day break and a Meta Thread for user feedback. A sample week is shown below:

Sunday 9/3 - This announcement is still pinned.
Monday 9/4 - Definition 1 testing period starts. A new announcement will be made and pinned to mark the start of the test.
Tuesday 9/5 - Continuation of testing period.
Wednesday 9/6 - Continuation of testing period.
Thursday 9/7 - Continuation of testing period.
Friday 9/8 - Continuation of testing period.
Saturday 9/9 - Definition 1 test period ends. A meta thread will be made and pinned to mark the end of the test. 
Q & A

Q: Why is there no user vote?

A: Votes on reddit suck. We can't get more than around 3 thousand users participating...out of a subreddit with 4 million subscribers. That's too small of a sample size to properly interpret as ""the will of the people"".

Q: 1984!!!

A: This isn't permanent. After the 4 definitions are tested, we are planning on making one final announcement a week after the end of the testing periods on whether or not the changes will go into effect at a later point in time. Please submit user feedback to this thread and the meta threads on how these definitions perform, we will value your input.

Q: What's up with definition 4?

A: Sometimes, going with something stupid just works. And if it works it ain't stupid. It's also super duper easy to understand.

Q: How are these definitions going to be enforced?

A: Like most of our rules, moderator discretion. That's just how reddit works, and ultimately how rules interpretation works with the near infinite variations of memes that can be created.

Q: Will I be banned for making horny posts then?

A: No, unless you are a repeat offender who either explicitly attempts to avoid post removal through reposting, or ignores the previous removals. We understand not everyone reads the announcements and won't be aware of the testing period.",1693526472.0

"Naruto","t5_2quts","1. We don't know if Itachi is nearly blind or sick in part 1.  Sasuke states using MS abilities (susanoo in particular) just hurt to use sometimes.

3. We also know later in the story? Itachi when even more sick and completely blind still could beat Orochimaru.

4. That pain quote doesn't actually mean Pain thinks Jiraiya had any chance against Pain. It means if Jiraiya knew about Nagato not being among the Pains? He could've went and attacked crippled Nagato in the control tower while the Pains were under frog song.",1693526472.0

You might find a nice larger piece of lace for the main lower part, and then a second smaller lace for the upper trim and just stitch them together. That's what one ""sewing edge"" on each will offer. But you might find some that are made this way. Alternatively, you could use a ribbon as a way to stitch 2 laces together.

I can't really tell what style of lace it is. It's probably a nice machine lace. You can do that with a yard or a meter of a nice lace. Maybe 2 if you want it gathered a little.",1693526472.0

"HistoryWhatIf","t5_35koa","First of all, in the middle of this McKinley did get shot and ended up dying 8 days later, so this is one hell of a week if we took fundamental details from 9/11 into 1901. 


September 6th - William McKinney shot by Leon Czolgosz, a Polish-American anarchist



September 6th to 11th - tensions rise as anti-anarchist riots turn into riots against immigrants, Jews, the Spanish and anarchists. 



September 11th - Two explosions rock the harbors of New York City, killing about 2,000. Similar to that of the Halifax Explosion of 1917. 



September 14th - McKinney does of his assassination injuries, T. Roosevelt becomes president. 



September - October 1901: Waves of lynchings, riots and mobs occur across the United States, especially in the South and in New York City. White supremacists overthrow local governments like they did in Wilmington in 1898, releasing immigrant and Jewish from jails and homes to lynch them, like they did to Leo Frank. Tens of people die in the ensuing chaos. Anti-Spanish sentiments rise as well. 



October 1901 - T. Roosevelt orders the riots be put down whether by federal or state troops, and the riots end. 



October 1901 - 1902 - T. Roosevelt now has more of a reason to wage war against the Spanish, claiming that the Spanish were responsible for the attacks, leading the 1901-1905 administration to be more militaristic, interventionist, and war hungry. More Spanish land was captured than in 1898 and the U.S sees Latin America as more of a dangerous threat than in the current timeline, leading to more intervention in Central and South America. 



Bills are passed restricting immigration as well, giving the 1904 election even more of a Republican victory. Leading the Dems to be more progressive, militarist and expansionist to adapt in the new party system. 



1908 is a close, but narrow victory for William Jennings Bryan.",1693526472.0

"Universitaly","t5_2w7ww8","Guarda, io ho fatto esattamente quello che non vorresti fare ora, ovvero iniziare a matematica e poi passare a Gestionale alla fine del primo anno.

Non mi pento di aver fatto così  perché l'anno di Matematica non è stato un anno veramente perso dato che ho imparato un sacco di cose che mi sono tornate utili a Gestionale quindi se fossi in te non escluderei completamente questa possibilità.

Tanto per finire una triennale in matematica almeno 4 anni ci vogliono per quasi tutti mentre per Gestionale è molto più fattibile finire in corso, quindi se tu provi con Matematica e dopo il primo anno cambi a Gestionale potresti comunque finire in 4 anni circa come se avessi proseguito con Matematica.

Ovviamente se il tuo obbiettivo è una veloce ed efficiente entrata nel mondo del lavoro allora dovresti puntare subito su Gestionale.

Ma se vuoi fare Matematica e quindi sei disposto a studiare per 4 anni circa allora falla e mal che vada cambi senza perdere effettivamente altri anni, ma almeno così andrai avanti senza rimorsi.",1693526472.0

It might do you a bit of good to not sit up and tell people what they should and shouldn't post about.

This is maybe the 5th or 6th time in the last few months that Ao3 has been down and so people are going to freak out about that and post about it frequently cause everytime that this happens, it could be the last time that it happens.

There are people who were in the middle of uploading their works and editing their works when this site down again and maybe some of them are afraid that their works are going to go poof and disappear because this site can't seem to stay alive for a long period of time.

But what the fuck do I know?   I am just a complainer on here.",1693526473.0

If possible, put her on the potty when she asks to go. That's enough. It won't discourage using the potty, but it won't add adult-led potty training to your life right now either.

I know she will make more NSFW one's and I'm hoping I can find a way to have my display SFW. She's also the breed of cat I've wanted to own since I knew they existed. But yeah, on insta or whatever I've received death threats calling me a p*do when I was 17 when i first got my figure of her.

"singularity","t5_2qh8m","I think most organizations have so much demand that even with 40% productivity gains we aren’t going to see a lot of layoffs in the short term.  Longer term we might as not only will there be more productivity but you will need fewer applications as the AI will replace entire applications (for example I don’t need to build an underwriting system if I can just point an AI to my underwriting manual and a stack of apps and so go do it).  At some point though the AI wills do more and more of the work.  Auxiliary roles will start declining faster.  QA in particular but all of the operations roles as well. The push away from older techs will continue to accelerate and developers of these older techs will see steep declines accelerate.

Eventually who knows change will be so large that society will change so much that it is unpredictable. Though I bet those that deal well with abstraction, complexity, and systems such as developers will be better prepared than most for whatever comes next.",1693526473.0

I just tell people that the seat is taken. 

Now I’m not holding multiple seats or rows which, while I still believe is obnoxious, is technically still allowed and I’ve seen it done multiple times.

As far as not being as close, that just happens when you're largely apart from each other for a couple of decades.

"AlternateHistory","t5_2rux3","Without lend-lease support, the Soviets would have had a very difficult time going on the offensive.  Something like 80% of Soviet trucks were American made, and without those their logistics would suffer a lot.  The big counter attacks in 43 and 44 would have been much slower and less ambitious, and the Eastern Front part of the war would drag on much longer.  The Soviet oil fields in the Caucasus would also be vulnerable to Western Allied strategic bombing.

The question for Britain and the US is what would their war aims be?  Crushing Germany and restoring Poland free of Soviet influence might become their goal, but even if they could negotiate a peace deal with Stalin, they would immediately be in a Cold War with Poland as the front line.  I don't know how many atomic bombs it would have taken to force negotiations, but the British and Americans could not accept the casualties necessary to invade Russia.  The first two atomic bombs would probably fall on Berlin and Leningrad.

Japan might have gotten away with a negotiated peace, because the Americans would need their troops and atomic bombs in Europe.  They could even have offered to declare war on the Soviets in return for peace without losing core territories.  Alternatively, the US might just blockade Japan until they had atomic bombs to spare in 1946 or 47.",1693526474.0

I like Final Fantasy, for and in spite of some of its design quirks over the years, but XIII was and still is ""gay as hell"" compared to its contemporaries

Again, not trying to tread on anyone. You can identify however you like and still think this looks cool, because it does and it is. I like it, I'd sport it knowing I'd probably get razzed by some for having it. Perhaps not the best phrasing to use in this day and age, but once upon a time calling something gay was somewhere between an endearing tease and a mild jab at the superficial quality of something. Regardless it's my bad, most people my age have grown out of it and I'm still working on it I guess.

Even though you say ""*my parents have never been able to say no to my brother and he's extremely manipulative*"", that doesn't change the fact that it's **their** house and **their** rules. The only person who can forcibly evict A from the house is one of your parents. Not you.

Certainly, you get a say in it. But you've **done** that, to no avail. In fact, it's made things worse, because your mom is making you look like the bad guy who should apologize.

You are also entitled to say: ""I'm not subsidizing A's lifestyle here. I'm only paying for me."" You told us you are ""*helping to supplement our grocery bills*"", and then having to throw in more money because A is eating your family out of house and home and entertaining her friends there as well.

""Helping supplement the grocery bills"" is the wrong way to go about it. What you should do is sit down and work out a fair amount for you to contribute.

Let's say there are five people in the household, including A. You should be contributing 20% of the food (assuming you all eat roughly the same amount and type of food), 20% of the water (again, assuming no one takes 30-minute showers), 20% of the electricity, and so on.

Add it all up. Add on a reasonable amount of rent for the bedroom you occupy as well. Whatever the total is, that's what you should be paying. If your parents say ""That's unfair! A is a guest here, and shouldn't have to pay anything. So you should be paying a greater proportion of the total, OP!"", you are allowed to respond with ""Nope. I'm paying a fair amount for the resources I use and the space I take up. I am not subsidizing a person you chose to invite in. That's on you.""

NTA for not apologizing. You have nothing to apologize for.

"boyslove","t5_2sbdb","***Dubbed***?

Yes, this series is dubbed, as are most CDramas… a lot of that is due to dialect differences among the cast.  Also for a series filmed like this was (countless outdoor locations, machinery, crew size, etc.) dubbing is absolutely necessary.  But… you would never know it in this however. Fear not.

***Is this a BL?***

I came into watching BL wanting to see as much steam/smut/spice as possible. Believe me when I say, I have seen ***every*** series that has a high steam level… every series!! But after all of that, I promise you that the most believable love stories I ever came across in the BL world are in **The Untamed** (and **Word of Honor**, which I recommend for your upcoming The Untamed hangover).   
I was floored by the build-up and compelling nature of these couples. On screen steamy physical intimacy is fun (I still love it) but it *doesn’t* tell a love story. What does however is devotion, chemistry, commitment, loyalty, sacrifice, quiet, simple moments with heat-filled gazes only meant to be shared by the men in question. Missing out on all of that is such a disservice to your BL experience.  Trust me… *the love will blow… you… away*!!!

***About the length:***

I went into **The Untamed** thinking I’d probably quit after 10 episodes or so. Up until then, I’d only watched about 80 BLs and *none* of them had been longer than 16 episodes (and I’d thought 16 was too many 🤣.)

Sadly I think we’ve been conditioned to think some of our 12 - 16 episode BLs could/should be shorter. Why? Because we’re so used to unnecessary filler scenes plaguing our series (e.g., long uneventful walks by one or both MLs, numerous eating scenes, one ML sitting alone thinking, conversations about nothing, silly banter with side characters, considerably less interesting side couples, etc., etc.) Fast forward anyone??

**The Untamed** has *none* of that useless filler. *Every* minute is meaningful, compelling, important to the story… and entertaining!  And when you see that you *ONLY* have 10 or so episodes left, I suspect that you’ll be mourning the fact that your amazing journey will be ending soon.

***About the initial confusion***:

To be fair, the first couple episodes *will* feel confusing. The first two will have you saying “*what the heck is this and why am I watching it*?”  That is *absolutely* normal and happens to most everyone who watches it for the first time (I say first time because almost everyone who watches this amazing series, eagerly watches a it 2nd, 3rd, or more times.) Just persevere through that initial confusion. I promise that before you know it everything will “click” … you’ll understand what’s going on and who is who, and then you will be hopelessly hooked.  Don’t even bother trying to track names… they fall into place too (most everyone has 2 or 3 different names).

A piece of fun advice : Before going on to episode #34, go back and watch episodes #1 & 2 again. You’ll be blown away at how they will make complete sense now.

I envy you that this is your first time watching this wonder of a series. You are in for magic and a new drama worldview. Happy watching. 😊💕",1693526475.0

Unless you mean in case of a hardware breach that someone had access to your ledger device and your pin. Perhaps the ledger could have a 2 factor requirement of some sort.

The problem is that every other type of hack has no recourse and is ultimate.

The only way to completely secure your seed words when stolen would be to use multiple passphrases (25th words) and never store any of them on the ledger device.  The problem is, I don't even like punching it in when the ledger is hooked up to the computer or phone.... Paranoid as all hell that something could be watching my passphrase being typed in through the USB port.  But it's still probably better than having it stored on there, or so some have said on here.

And I found someone that designed a small 3d printed washer holder that you can put passphrases on a washer, or seed phrases on multiple washers, and 3d print around them, basically sealing them until you are ready to break open the 3d print. And the prints look like little toy blocks... Kinda cool. If you want the 3d print link, I'll post it.",1693526475.0

Is your mind working on such 2 dimensional plane that everything has one set meaning? It literally takes about 5 seconds to come up with any idea to counter your argument 

Do you get aroused when you see a depiction of a naked human in biology books in 5th grade? I don't think so. 

Imagine a child after some serious surgery, pissing itself constantly on the bed because all the doctors refused to install a catheter because ""that's pedophilia""

Fuck it, let's go a step further. The surgery involved some private parts, and the doctor refused to perform it. And when finally some other surgeon decided to do it, turns out an video showing how to perform the operation was deleted because ""that's child pornography"" so he can't do it anyway",1693526475.0

Yet, they keep the other person around because they really are benefiting in some way just not in ways the mistress/mister is benefitting them.  And the monogamous partner they are sure would not be okay with them being with another.  So that is how many of them end up cheating, attempting to have their cake and eat it too.

"slatestarcodex","t5_30m6u",">Incidentally you could also cut off the top part of the distribution and see the same effect (it's also true in your graphs, if you block off say everything above $100k, the remainder will also look more random).

This seems false on its face. If I block off all data points above $100k (or above ~40k, which would actually be the inverse of what Taleb does, or at plenty of other arbitrarily selected points) in either graph, there remains an obvious albeit somewhat weaker correlation between IQ and income. On the other hand, if the fat tail is excluded, the correlation essentially completely disappears. 

In other words: the fact that the effect size will be reduced *at all* no matter what part of the data set one excludes proves that you're right in only one very narrow sense: that what Taleb does to make his argument is something that will also somewhat reduce the effect size of many potential correlations. But the fact that the effect size is changed so asymmetrically between comparative exclusions of the two potential regions of data is absolutely still evidence that the correlation is actually (not just due to statistical artifact) much weaker beyond the fat-tailed end. 

Imagine for a moment that you're the author of a study, and you've gathered data that *actually does* graph a phenomenon that is very strong at one particular end of a distribution, and very weak or non-existent at the nother. Is it really never justified to exclude the resulting fat tail in your data set, in at least one of your paper's various analyses, in order to show that correlation disappears in one end of the distribution? How else do you show the non-linear nature of the correlation?

>all it's showing is that Taleb just made an elementary error any third year statistics student would get dinged for.

Actually, I think you're the one who'd get dinged. Your statistics professor would probably explain to you that the fact that eliminating a region of data can often change the strength of a correlation does not mean that every analysis is in error that eliminates a region of data in order to highlight the way in which that region heavily biases the overall correlation.",1693526476.0

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","So there is a couple venues to look at this, while the sex with the dog is concerning adding in the dead animals brings a whole new concern to the table , the McDonald's triad 

Does he still wet the bed ? Any interest in fire?


So the big concern here is he has fit one of the 3 pillars of the McDonald's triad 

In case you are not aware the McDonald's triad has 3 characteristics of behaviors that are exhibited by someone that could potentially be a serial killer.
1. Cruelty to animals 
2 pyromancy
3 bed wetting

The theory states that if a person hits all 3 markers the odds that they will become a serial killer are increased
I have never heard of someone as young as him fitting on the triad, however that's not to say it's impossible.
More something to be aware


Focusing on the sex with the dog, at that young age sexual behaviors are a learned personal trait , this means he either seen someone do it, had someone do it to him etc.
This is not a conversation that should be had with a normal therapist 
You need to have your brother seen by a forensic interviewer 
To.do.this report this the situation to CPS , the cps worker will likely also come.to.the conclusions your brother is acting out the sexual abuse trauma cycle and will ask for a forensic interview.

CPS workers and therapists don't interview a sex abuse victim because a forensic interviewer has a special skill set in dealing with that kind of trauma and uncovering what happened. Also if someone did something to your brother a CPS worker , you, or a therapist may taint the evidence for the court testimony
Children are hard to interview 

There is no doubt in my mind this kid had something happen or saw something, just need to figure out the what, the who and the when.


Lastly touching on the parents
Regardless of how the parents exited and on what terms it will have a trauma inducing effect on your brother, no matter how well you fill the gap you are not mom and dad and that is going to cause lifelong inner turmoil and mental health issues 
I'd wager he is also probably missing development milestones

I'd look at getting him into Comprehensive Community Services with a social worker who can line up with community supports 
To do this just speak to your pediatrician, you will.need a prescription but I have never seen any pediatric physician give someone a problem
I'd also recommend individual and family therapy.

My final piece of advice don't change how you interact with your brother.
With the dead animals or with the dog 
Odds are he is very confused and doesn't understand what he did was wrong, especially if someone did something 
If your brother was assaulted and is acting out those behaviors on your dog punishing him will make him think he did something wrong (if something happened prior to the dog ) 
Which may cause him to shut down and bury his trauma even further
He needs to feel like he has a safe space to talk about and process what happened.",1693526476.0

When I started back into OLD after a breakup last year, I had a couple people either ghost me or flip out when I brought it up (before we even kissed), despite having built good rapport up to that point.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","“Killing” is a very exaggerated term for what abortion is. Again - trying to implicate me in an immoral position in order to elevate your biased and factually incorrect one is not the gotcha you think it is.

The socioeconomic interpretation I laid out of access to abortion is a valid one regardless of how clutched dein pearls are. Access to abortion spares the social welfare system of having to absorb the cost of abandoned children and the social and economic cost of women being rendered single mothers - and this being less economically mobile - or trapped in relationships they might not have wanted to be in.

Not to mention the cost of the sheer damage restricting the access to medically needed abortions causes in terms of women who lost their wanted but unviable children.

I am not evaluating life. I am evaluating the cost of the lives ruined by needless, indefensible and baseless restrictions to healthcare you want imposed on people. The fact of the matter is you have no basis for your argument. You are against abortions? Fine - don’t have one. No one will judge you for it. But you want to judge others for the decisions they might want or need to make. That’s the whole point of this.

FWD: Billings GFSZA incident

Dear MSSA Friends,

Several you have written me about the media reports of Gabriel Metcalf
of Billings having been arrested and charged with violating the
federal Gun Free School Zones Act. The media has tried to paint
Metcalf as a total wingnut, but I have information in conflict with
that assessment. Maybe the chief complaint about Metcalf came from
the principal of the school across the street from Metcalf's home,
someone who may be anti-gun, or at least unfamiliar with firearms as
he accused Metcalf of carrying a rifle when he carried a single-shot,
20 gauge shotgun.

First, one bill that MSSA got enacted in 1995 exempts law abiding
Montanans from the GFSZA. Here's the current Montana law:

45-8-360. Establishment of individual licensure. In consideration that
the right to keep and bear arms is protected and reserved to the
people in Article II, section 12, of the Montana constitution, a
person who has not been convicted of a violent, felony crime and who
is lawfully able to own or to possess a firearm under the Montana
constitution is considered to be individually licensed and verified by
the state of Montana within the meaning of the provisions regarding
individual licensure and verification in the federal Gun-Free School
Zones Act.

The GFSZA declares that people licensed by the state are exempt from the GFSZA.

Second, Metcalf has an attorney from the federal public defenders
office. They have a reputation for being quite competent. I sent
Metcalf's attorney an email informing him about the Montana statute.
I've not heard back from him.

Third, there is another way to view this situation - as a small cloud
with a large golden lining. Consider ...

Since the SCOTUS Bruen decision and its major change of the 2A legal
landscape, our side has been winning RKBA legal cases all over the US.
The case against Metcalf has serious problems - it is worse than weak.
The current US Attorney for Montana is a solid political leftist.

While I'm not thrilled about the suffering and disturbance that
Metcalf must endure, this is a super opportunity to challenge and
maybe torpedo the stupid federal Gun Free School Zones Act.

Here's how I hope this will progress. Metcalf will move to dismiss
charges based on unconstitutionality the GFSZA under the new Bruen
standard. The federal district court judge will deny the motion to
dismiss (or grant it) based on the Bruen standard. That decision will
be appealed to the Ninth Circuit and from there to SCOTUS. We will
rally all sorts of 2A entities to weigh in with amicus briefs. The
GFSZA will go into the dust bin of history and the gun-grabbing feds
will get another legal drubbing.

So, other than the trouble for Metcalf, I see this situation as more
of a great opportunity for us and a stupid mistake by the feds.

I am watching ...

Best wishes,

I'm not quite sure what the best role is for Faalogo going forward, I was frustrated with Bellamy not starting him on the wing but the impact he made off the bench was so amazing, it makes me think that's his role for the team for a year or two. 

Past that, we're going to have some seriously tough decisions to make, it'd be great to have Paps at 1 and Faalogo as a winger for the next 5 years but I think it's clear Sua has the ability to be a starting fullback in the NRL, and will probably ask for an equivalent salary.

Think of the expression “Jew them down” or this kind of book title what you will, but there is zero chance a respectable publisher or book store in a civilised country, with even a modicum of respect, would publish or stock this kind of thing.

I simply don't agree that ""having a whole island"" or the representative is lording power over nonbenders in any way.

I also want to point out that of those people, literally 4 of them were airbenders, and three of them were children. All those acolytes were nonbenders – any nonbending citizen of the city that felt they deserved a piece of the island was free to join lol, they just had to conform to air nomad culture, which in its emphasis on spirituality and the suchlike isn't very appealing to most people.",1693526479.0

I can deal with inch-worms and speed runners. My bases have timings set up with those in mind. It's the people that just want to ruin the bases that ruin the game for me.

Oh and the constant threat/cost increase on random blocks. The corrosive cubes I got. The laser, not so much. When they upped its cost and threat, and I had a normal base that was just a vertical tube with lasers in it, all visible, just basically a training ground for new players, which at its most got 7 kills off 1 person, double in cost and go to Brutal. The base became literally unplayable. I set up a new normal.bas3, just to see what it constituted. 4 non-corrosive cube traps, and 4 guards. That's a 'normal' base...",1693526479.0

"shakespeare","t5_2rouy","omg i'm also a first-time directing shakespeare at my college! anyway considering the audience r&j seems like the obvious choice- i think its slightly more accessible if only because it IS more well-known - people who have never done a shakespeare show before know r&j, but lear they might not be super familiar with, and same with your audience (wider demographic of uni students). also, if you have budget constraints (like my org does), it might be difficult to do a play that IS known to be difficult to stage (taking your word for it, i personally dk). HOWEVER, having a show youre really passionate about is also more important imo, even if it will be a challenge - i'm directing macbeth, and like there are several scenes where when we were pitching it my codirector and i had NO IDEA how we'd pull off, but we figured some of them out over the summer by basically being willing to watch a billion versions and see how different productions did it differently. and maybe budget / space / time constraints will get you to be super creative with lear? which might result in an overall more fun production for both you, your actors, your crew, and your audience!

break a leg!

(btw - if you're leaning lear and you want to look at how people have staged it in the past, i HIGHLY recommend marvin rosenberg's book on the subject - the one he wrote for macbeth was super helpful!

Hello! I want to address an ongoing issue that has been persistently ignored or met with dishonest responses for the past twelve months. It seems likely that this post might also be deleted, given the pattern of experiences I've had. This unfortunate situation has even resulted in me being without a phone for two months.

My frustration stems from a situation where I was charged for services I couldn't use for ten months. Despite my refusal to pay more under these circumstances, the company attempted to charge a card I had never authorized them to use. They lacked even the basic information like my IMEI number, and yet somehow I'm being held responsible for the problems.

I urge everyone not to underestimate the emotional toll of a year spent paying for services that remain inaccessible and being bounced around without resolution. Recently, I was misled by the FCC, being assured that Visible (the service provider) had responded and that I would receive a reply letter – a promise that hasn't materialized even as of last week. It's frustrating to receive no answers or acknowledgment for the valid questions I've raised.

Could anyone provide information about the appropriate ethics contact, which the company is unwilling to share? Additionally, I would greatly appreciate recommendations for review platforms that have a wide audience (especially those that support image uploads). Thank you to everyone for your input, except for Visible, as their actions have led to financial losses and a sense of being taken advantage of. It's disheartening to be in a situation where I'm made to feel responsible for circumstances beyond my control.

"datingoverthirty","t5_34cyw","My first love got sabotaged by my own family, so ‘love’ became a confusing road for me. So after some wasteful time being in a relationship with someone that I didn’t share the same future goals with, I started seeing relationships as a time to exchange a few qualities by enriching the other with knowledge and gaining knowledge as well. Either a skill, or an awareness, or just some experience. After a while you forget the point and stay stuck in that situation where there is nothing new to give, it feels like ‘staying because leaving is painful’ afterwards those moments were truly the waste of time. Knowing them, sharing a certain time, was helpful and needed, but the attached part was too much. Yes it was needed to go build a deeper connection, but we got lost in there.
Once I hit a certain age I was ready to get married to the love of my life, (got a spiritual vision out of no where that told me to truly be happy with this person) only to be rejected by him and feel the most depressed I’ve ever been. It wasn’t worth it. I channeled that love onto the next one I could give it to. Not the first person I dated afterward, but someone I truly felt like ‘ok, this one I can truly see myself settle down with, and let the thought of that love of my life person go. Said goodbye in person and felt happy with this new found love. Again, that relationship went to hell. I was experienced more than he was when it comes to relationships and had certain lowered expectations yet totally dedicated that we would not let go of each other (like a marriage) but we weren’t married yet, although talking about it, and that also caused massive damage to my heart. Afterwards the love of my life suddenly came back to my life, rushing,  and I was again in heaven. Stupid me, was crushed in my heart again. At this point I am never looking for love ever again, love is for myself now and reserved for God, I am not eager to commit or ever settle down either, I’ve done that and I’m over that. 

I just want to share a few moments now and then with someone I meet that hopefully is on the same page, without too much attachment.  Best case scenario for me someone from my past coming back for some emotional healing. And meeting someone new to spend some time with, go on a road trip or exchange some goods or services. Nothing from my body, mind or heart, is free anymore, a relationship is pure exchange and diplomatic approach now. 
I am exhausted and I am 32.
And I truly wonder,

Russia entered the war to overthrow the Zelensky government.  In fact, it believed that this would have been relatively easy.  No, it did not have any designs to the ""Ukrainian state"" overall.  My guess is that if Russia had managed to secure an agreement by the US on a guarantee on Ukrainian neutrality, the war would not have happened.  After two months of continuous negotiations, the US rejected the Russian requests.  The war started immediately after that.  My guess is that Russia was looking for a government in Kyiv more in agreement with the neutrality policy.  

\> In WWI and WWII we saw repeatedly how anti-war Socialists virtually evaporated once war broke out and were swept up in the tide, with most of the population in every country supporting 'their team' at first, it's just how the masses act in these situations.

I agree with that, of course.  In the end, nobody wants to be on the losing side.",1693526481.0

"oregon","t5_2qhjg","This isn't what a 4 day work week should be.

We should be advocating and showing the research that corroborates that 32 hour work weeks are best for productivity.

You may say, ""I don't want to take the pay cut!""

You shouldn't, all our pay should adjust so we make the same as working 40 hours gets us now.

""What about losing the 8 hours for every worker, every work week?""

Hire more people. There's 7 days a week. With a 4 day work week you can have more innovative scheduling and still let people have 3 days off in a row.

""Where do you get the people? Unemployment is obscenely low.""

The people are there, they just can't work because of the time commitment so they work in the grey job markets getting paid under the table. People are working longer and pushing back retirement all the time. There are people to fill the jobs, we just ostracize, other and ignore huge swaths of people because they don't ""fit in"" to the 5 day work week.

""Where's the money come from? You're double labor costs!""

Shareholders and executives have been robbing us of our increased productivity for nearly 50 years and have become billionaires and trillionaires from it. They need to grow the eff up and realize making more in an hour than most of their employees make a year is unsustainable. 

DON'T SELL YOURSELF SHORT. You deserve a true 4 day work week. We all do.

I am buying out my lease with Toyota and so far I have found interest rates about 6.5%. My credit score is 825. Is this a good rate for current market?

I was about to go with USAA because at this point I just want to get it over with -- something seemed odd to me though, they would not let me do a down payment and stated I had to finance the entire amount I owe (the total buyout price plus tax). They said I would have to give Toyota more money to decrease the loan, not to USAA. This seemed really weird, but I've never done this before so maybe I am clueless.

TLDR: any info on current lease buyout interest rates and down payments on lease buyout loans

Thanks!

The public would be there, but so too would there be Sisters and Septas present. Most offering flowers picked from the gardens of the Motherhouse to the children passing by the large man-made lake that existed before the structure. 

This Motherhouse would also have a larger amount of elderly that would go to seek council inside or aid. They would be present along stone benches that sat close to the lake where they could throw seeds and crumbs at the ducklings in the water. It was a pleasant day in Lannisport with a strong sun that made parasols in fashion.

"MedicalGore","t5_2zkms","That's one of 2 medications used in combination for a medical abortion. 

Here's more info: 

Aid Access ships single doses of mifepristone and misoprostol to use for a medically induced abortion, following an online consultation. This is currently legal (May, 2022)

These are safe to use up to 10 weeks after the last missed period. 

Aid Access is able to send the medications to be saved to use if needed. If they ARE needed, users reconnect with them to be talked through the process.

Depending on how long one has been pregnant, these medications are 97-99% effective, without damaging future reproductive health. 

The effects of the medications are indistinguishable from a miscarriage. If medical aftercare is needed, there is no need to inform anyone about the abortion. 

Because the effects are like those of a miscarriage, or an especially heavy period, it is relatively easy to hide what’s happening from others in the same home, as well as medical care providers. Food poisoning plus period is a reasonable explanation. 

The medication pack is $150 in some US states, $110 in others. If you cannot pay that, contact the organizers for assistance. 

Please thoughtfully consider whether you or someone you care about might need access to a safe, medical abortion within the next few years. Please include all those with a uterus, including trans men and non binary people. 

To financially support Aid Access, you can make a donation to Women on Waves: https://aidaccess.org/en/page/301373/support-aid-access

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8",">Police brutality is bad and any cop who does something like hide their badge or turn off their camera should be fired. Any cop who engages in brutality should be arrested.

And who should do that?

Other cops.

Who isn't doing that?

Other cops.

>But come on, not every cop is bad.

Every good cop quickly either stops being good, or *stops being a cop*. Good cops get fired.

The core of the issue is this: one cop engages in brutality. Ten other cops watch and don't do anything about it.

ACAB is essentially the assertion that those other cops are also bad cops. Yes, even if they're sometimes saving lives and stopping crimes. Standing by and watching the brutality - and not attempting to stop it - makes them bad cops.

And virtually all cops do that. The ones that do try to stop brutality (and sexual assault, and other bad things) rapidly get fired (there are plenty of examples of this). All the ones that are left are the ones who are willing to ignore the bad things happening.

And, uniquely, cops are the only part of society where ""I couldn't do anything about it"" is expressly *not* a defense. Police explicitly have a monopoly of violence. They have weapons and the express authorization to use them to protect the people.

"AliciaNavarro","t5_4yxfpw","I partially disagree. 

The taxpayers paid a pretty penny in investigating this case. While the federally-funded FBI support of the case was likely paltry, the taxpayers in Glendale paid a lot of money looking for Alicia and they deserve at least limited answers from an ethics standpoint. Since there is no mechanism for only letting the people of Glendale know and keeping everyone else out of the loop, the rest of us deserve limited answers through that proxy. 

Broadly speaking, what the police find out during their investigation only necessitates release if and when it goes to trial, but how Glendale police are spending their time is something that should be public, and it is through that relationship that limited answers as to what has been discovered is due to the public. However, they may close the investigation and say that nothing criminal was identified and nothing further will be released, which would eliminate any limited entitlement that exists because the taxpayers are no longer funding it, but that would be a material update.

My point is that I partially disagree with the notion that the public doesn't deserve ANY answers.",1693526483.0

"ldssexuality","t5_3hxpt","""Would the leaders of the church share your beliefs?"" Well... 3 weeks ago I attended the wedding where the bride recently joined the church and went through the temple for the very first time just that day. Her husband told me afterward that she was so worried about wearing at the reception the sleeveless low-cut (lots of cleavage) wedding dress that her mother hand sewed for her over a year earlier... before she joined the church and learned about temple garments. The husband told me that she took the temple lessons with our former stake president and his wife, during which time she expressed her uncertainty about wearing the dress, knowing they would not accommodate garments. They told her they could not make that decision for her... it was between her and the Lord. With much trepidation, she decided to wear the dress her mom worked so hard to make for her. The husband shares that at the reception she went to say hello to the former stake president and his wife... when she gave him a hug he literally said to her,""I'm so glad to see that you decided to wear the dress. I couldn't make the decision for you, but I am happy to see you decided to honor your mother's hard work this way. You look beautiful!"" The husband said that all her fears and uncertainty melted with that statement and she had an amazing time at her reception. 
So I ask, who showed the pure light and love of Christ? The former stake president who saw the true beauty of a blushing bride and did NOT judge her for wearing a sleeveless low-cut wedding dress? Or the person who looked with disgust at a woman wearing tight leggings and wondered if she was wearing garments?
When the woman was caught in adultery and brought to Christ for him to judge, He did not judge her. And He discouraged others from judging as well.",1693526483.0

"AskAnAmerican","t5_2uah7","American demographics are typically drawn on racial lines, e.g. in the census, or exit polls during elections. It's a completely normal way to talk about our society. 

I actually think this is an important point, too - I know that, for example, France and Japan don't record race or ethnicity in their censuses - they claim it's to ensure that everyone is ""equally a citizen,"" but we all know that, in practice, it's just a way for the ethnic majority to enforce their norms on minorities under the guise of ""equality.""

Anyway, the fact that Americans can even have discussions about ethnic/racial demographics is actually pretty neat, because it allows us to identify inequalities that countries like France or Japan literally can't even acknowledge exist, let alone analyze or solve.

"baltimore","t5_2qipq","Deborah Morris represents a serious problem with urban planning in the US. people who don't know what they're talking about get angry because they personally don't like whatever change is happening. any and every reason under the sun can and will be employed to try to crush it under NIMBY complaints about unrelated things, like ADA sidewalks, ""your organization is illegal"" etc. etc.. or to complain that they weren't reached out to enough (I've been to other meetings where she has shown up. she asks the same questions over and over even after getting answers, and is incredibly hostile and disruptive in the process as she tries to highjack other topics)

she complains about outreach but it's obvious that there is no outreach that will be useful, as she's already made up her mind about everything. outreach may need improvement and doing so early might prevent her from becoming such a ardent crusader of the car, but city-wide planning can't and shouldn't come to a grinding halt every time someone does not like bike what the city is planning. parking in her area isn't bad. not even close to bad. 

the folks doing the planners need to get better at trying to assuage such people's concerns early on, but we also have to make sure that 2-3 upset residents don't get an outsized voice, especially when it would cost the city millions AND produce objectively worse urban planning.",1693526484.0
"SubSimulatorGPT2","t5_121sso","Yes, it is ok for socialists to use the state to regulate private property. That is a given, and socialism is based upon the state being the most ethical form of governance.

That said, there is no need for socialists to use the state to regulate private property. They have the means to regulate, and in a socialist society the means already exist.

The ""do the same thing"" is a strawman. The reason that the state is necessary is because there has been no meaningful means by which to regulate. By using the state, socialists allow the government to regulate.",1693526484.0

Yeah I don't get it either, you really have no hate you can build as a healer or have to try and balance off the tank. While I haven't tested it, I would assume just stacking and taking damage, while healing through it, would probably do more damage, than the DPS loss from moving and dancing.",1693526485.0

Most of those are my double days, when I've already spent 8hrs facing customers, unlocking high theft items so often I can't even do my actual job roles and then I have to go do it again for more of my day? It's tough and finding some sort of balance falls upon me so that I don't let my ""team"" down. The problem goes deeper though, where the department doesn't feel like a team and moral is so low that people just give up and seem to float by with trying to do as little as possible while still collecting a paycheck. All in all the customer really loses and when they feel they can't get help, they'll shop elsewhere and the company loses even more. It's a dirty cycle!",1693526485.0

Heard of Rakesh Sharma?

He is the only Indian citizen to travel in space, although there have been other astronauts of Indian origin who travelled to space, who were not Indian citizens.

n 1984, Sharma became the first Indian citizen to enter space when he flew aboard the Soviet rocket Soyuz T-11 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic on 3 April 1984. The Soyuz T-11 spacecraft carrying cosmonauts including Sharma docked and transferred the three member Soviet-Indian international crew, consisting of the ship's commander, Yury Malyshev, and flight engineer, Gennadi Strekalov, to the Salyut 7 Orbital Station. Sharma spent 7 days, 21 hours, and 40 minutes aboard the Salyut 7 during which his team conducted scientific and technical studies which included forty-three experimental sessions.

Do home health. More Money, easier interventions, and you get to change locations rather than be stuck in a facility for 8 hours. Sure the documentation is a little extensive but I mean its 5-8 notes vs. trying to cram 30 notes frantically before leaving the facility.

I used to work at OP mill, lost my mind - left. Tried a cash based clinic to spend more time with patients, lost my mind again - left. Switched to home health and haven't looked back. Now thinking about doing Travel PT HH just to get out of town a little.

Now compared to then, it has gotten slightly better. Our doctor recommended a probiotic and kolic water to help with the gas (from the hard time pooping, farting and burping) which we give him most nights and sometimes in the morning. I’m not 100% sure if that is reason why it’s getting better but I really think the MAIN cause is just his system maturing and getting the hang of it.

I think maybe it was time for people who don’t get along to no longer force the issue. If she has any sadness or remorse, I’d never hear it. I can’t really admit to sadness or remorse. I kinda wish she were a different type of person, but I’ve accepted who she is and chose to disassociate.

The Dobbs Court did not rule that abortion is bad, or shouldn't be legal, but rather that it's not constitutionally protected.

A man was driving down the road and broke down near a monastery. He went to the monastery, knocked on the door, and said,"" My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?""

The monks graciously accepted him, fed him dinner, and even fixed his car. As the man tried to fall asleep, he heard a strange sound; a sound like no other that he has ever heard. The next morning, he asked the monks what the sound was, but they replied, ""We can't tell you because you're not a monk.""

The man was disappointed but thanked them anyway and went on his merry way. Some years later, the same man broke down in front of the same monastery.The monks again accepted him, fed him, and even fixed his car. That night, he heard the same strange mesmerizing sound that he had heard years earlier. The next morning, he asked what the sound was, but the monks replied, ""We can't tell you because you're not a monk.""

The man said, ""All right, all right. I'm dying to know. If the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?""

The monks replied, ""You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.""

The man set about his task. Some forty-five years later, he returned and knocked on the door of the monastery. He said, "" I have traveled the earth and devoted my life to the task demanded and have found what you had asked for. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.""

The monks replied, ""Congratulations, you are correct, and you are now considered a monk. We shall now show you the way to the sound.""

The monks led the man to a wooden door, where the head monk said, ""The sound is behind that door.""

The man reached for the knob, but the door was locked. He asked, ""May I have the key?""

The monks gave him the key, and he opened the door. Behind the wooden door was another door made of stone. The man requested the key to the stone door. The monks gave him the key, and he opened it, only to find a door made of ruby. He demanded another key from the monks, who provided it. Behind that door was another door, this one made of sapphire. And so it went on until the man had gone through the doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.

Finally, the monks told him, ""This is the key to the last door.""

The man was relieved to be at the end. He unlocked the door, turned the knob, and behind that door he was astonished to find the source of that strange sound. It was truly an amazing and unbelievable sight.

But I can't tell you what it was because you're not a monk...",1693526491.0

He got up there and they weren’t even home, then they went out to dinner, then they showed someone the house, and then it was 8 at night so they couldn’t do anything.

"AITAH","t5_446kys","Trans people have entire ranges of different experiences. For me, my absolute first true experience with gender dysphoria was related entirely to my body. It was the feeling that the body itself was wrong, and that was when I was QUITE young. I wouldn’t be shocked if I was 6 or 7. It had nothing to do with what I played with, who I played with or anything. Personally I do not use the toys I played with or my friends as evidence to who I am. Those are small and shallow reasons and have no weight to my real internal experiences. 

To assume that your child is transgender based on such small things is really scary. While watching your kid play with things can allow your brain as parents to wonder if your child may be LGBT some day, it is quite extreme to assume that they would be the T before assuming one of the others. All in all, what matters most is that being LGBT/queer is not enforced, but also that being Hetero is not enforced. 

Above all your child is a person first, and the only person who can decide what he is. Even if your wife could read minds, she can not truly read the experience of other people. Especially children who are learning, exploring, and their likes and dislikes are subject to change at any time. 

Queer people and trans people don’t want to be told what they are, not by our friends, parents, allies or even other LGBT people. Not anymore than a hetero person would want to be told what they are or aren’t. It goes both ways. 

Tell your wife to get a fucking grip, because your kid could grow up absolutely hating the community she is trying to support & the damage to his own psyche at worst could be experiencing gender dysphoria by being forced to do things he doesn’t want to do. This is on either side. 

With love and patience, your kid could come out one day. Or maybe he never will because he’s not any of the above. 

You are quite literally already a better ally to my community by your one simple sentence stating that you wouldn’t mind. That is all it takes to be an ally, because those that speak for us have no idea what is really going on and they make our lives harder.

#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

How do you select from the statements of the Tantras?  What could be used to question the importance of something if a central practice for karmamudra is? If someone interprets tantric sexual practices literally, they should also recognize the importance of keeping sperm. There are meditations specifically related to this. Moreover, the pressure of the perineum or the tension of the muscles there is also related to the exercise. This is not only the case in Buddhist Tantra anyway, but in the Taoist and Hindu Tantras. Tantric Taoism specifically forbade the practice of martial arts for three days after the loss of sperm outside the vagina and required a cleansing prayer. By the way, Tantra came to Taoism through Buddhism from its Hindu roots. Vajrayana Buddhism is the strictest in this area. Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism are even milder than Vajrayana. Sperm itself and ejaculation in Eastern cultures are terribly important unlike the West, as they are attributed to chi, prana or other vitality, along with other sexual secretions.

At karmamudra, when a man reaches the state of highest pleasure, he uses strong visualization and breathing exercises to hold back the sperm and channel the life force within it to the upper chakras. This is also the case with a visualized spouse. Gampopa himself wrote about it.",1693526492.0

"BCPublicServants","t5_25c2l2","as others have said, yes, ask for feedback. if you are external, they are not required to give feedback, and some hiring managers may not provide feedback until the end of the competition when the feedback timeline starts. So, don't be surprised if you get nothing, or don't get a response for like a month or two out. But, it's still100% worth it to ask. 

Was it a test through a website or an actual assignment you had to write out? I've seen in the past where hiring managers have like 60+ people screen through, they send out a couple tests, and then just pick the top 10-20 or so for interviews. So you could have been off by like one question or something.

"Pathfinder2e","t5_gkc60","Okay, better explanation. The Greek words εἴδωλον and εἰκών were borrowed into Latin as idolum and īcōn, then from there, eventually passed into English as idol and icon. ""Idol"" is fairly straightforward, where basically every language that uses the Latin script and borrowed the word just says ""idol"", but ""icon"" gets into the issue of how you represent /k/. In some languages, like English and a lot of Romance languages, it's still spelled with a C like it was in Latin. But in others, like a lot of non-English Germanic languages, where /k/ is always <k>, it gets changed to ""ikon"".

At least in English, switching C to K in Greek-derived words is very much a *choice*. For example, even if you use the Greek name Herakles, instead of the Roman name Hercules, you'll still see Herakles with a K for kappa and Heracles with a Latinate C in fairly free variation. It's trying to base it *much* more directly on the original Greek form, as opposed to taking it into account, but still spelling it like a Roman. So ""ikon"" looks weird, because it's using that K for the original kappa, instead of changing it to a C like the Romans, but it's still changing the initial EI to just I.

And again, they've done this with other words. Summoners have **ei**dolons, not **i**dolons, ""despite"" it not being a Greek class, because that's just how the word is spelled. It's actually a fairly recent borrowing, so it's still spelled eidolon, unlike its doublet, ""idol"". And personally, I'd expect a similar treatment for this. Either icon or eikon, but not ikon.",1693526494.0

It’s also not just one day of work a good photographer will meet with the family to plan the photos, then travel to the actual wedding, and then edit and sort through thousands of photos. They have to bring their equipment which is super expensive and has a high risk of it being damaged. Especially if alcohol is being served because drunk people are clumsy and are not thinking clearly.

My dad was a sound guy growing up (DJ/band coordinator/burned CDs/odd jobs) I can tell you weddings are some of the worst events to work. People will piss on your equipment, make it impossible to leave, and then after putting in all that work they will fight to not have to pay you.

I was invested in OTLK, because I was hoping the FDA would approve ONS 5010 given bevacizumab's extensive history - but they didn't.  

I still fail to understand how this wasn't known going in.  The FDA must have told OTLK along the way - I suspect during the initial BLA filing.",1693526495.0

"nrl","t5_2qn90","One of the best things about living in Sydney’s inner-east is the constant banter with Roosters and South Sydney supporters about their teams.  
  
Write a so-called positive piece about the Chooks, and Bunnies fans will accuse you of being in the pocket of their chairman, Nick Politis.  
  
Andrew Johns has delivered an ultimatum to players about their training preparation.  
  
Write something uplifting about the Bunnies, and the Chooks faithful will say you’re aligned to their co-owner, Russell Crowe. Or, even better, of lounging with fellow co-owner James Packer on his yacht with Instagram models. (Let me on, Mr Packer! I’ll sign an NDA!)  
  
More recently, a Roosters fan slowed down in Kings Cross and bellowed from his car, “When are you going to write a positive Roosters story!?”  
  
The reply was obvious: “When you start winning some games, champ.”  
  
Then the Roosters started winning games. Like a Melbourne Cup runner starting its run at the Flemington clocktower, they’ve claimed their last four to breathe life into a spluttering season.  
  
  
Souths, meanwhile, looked like the unbackable favourite mid-race before struggling to handle the track and distance with questions being asked about the ability of the trainer.  
  
The foundation clubs meet in a final-round fling on Friday night with the winner likely/possibly claiming eighth position, but both sets of supporters must wonder how it ever came to this.  
  
  
They shouldn’t be playing each other for eighth – they should be playing each other in the grand final.  
  
It’s been 88 years since the Roosters and Souths met in a decider – a 19-3 victory to Easts – but there was every indication this could be the year the mother of all grand finals might materialise.  
  
  
Certainly, both clubs have the roster, coaches, facilities and resources to do far better than they have, notwithstanding the injuries and bad luck that often makes or breaks a season.  
  
Souths’ problems have been put up in neon lights for the past week following the departure of assistant coach Sam Burgess, who wasn’t happy with the way head coach Jason Demetriou was handling superstars Latrell Mitchell and Cody Walker.  
  
But the Roosters have so far escaped the searing commentary they deserve because of their late-season resurgence. In fairness, though, coach Trent Robinson has been juggling as many issues this season as any in his 11 seasons in charge.  
  
First, he had an off-season wondering if back-rower Angus Crichton might ever play again as he grappled with bipolar disorder.  
  
Round one rolled around and there were two significant fires burning: captain James Tedesco wanted an extension on his deal while speculation was cranking up about Joseph Suaalii defecting to rugby union.  
  
Tedesco eventually got his extension while the club was strung out by Suaalii’s manager, Isaac Moses, who herded his player into the arms of Rugby Australia from 2025.  
  
Both players have been well below their best this year: Tedesco has overplayed his hand while Suaalii has been under enormous pressure amid a push from some at the club to get him off the books at the end of this season.  
  
  
So much of the optimism at the Roosters centred around the arrival of Storm hooker Brandon Smith, but he’s been distracted by off-field issues and only started playing the footy he’s renowned for in recent matches. It hasn’t helped that bench utility Connor Watson hasn’t played a match because of injury.  
  
You could go on and on, and I will: prop Matt Lodge left mid-season while assistant Jason Ryles was pushed out early for daring to chat to the Dragons about being their head coach.  
  
Meanwhile, loose units like Victor Radley and Jared Waerea-Hargreaves are suffering an existential crisis, caught between the aggressive way the game used to be played but being liabilities under the current interpretation of the rules that frequently dispatches them to the sin-bin or sidelines.  
  
Then there’s the curious case of Sam Walker, the young halfback who was dropped earlier in the year before suffering a knee injury.  
  
There’s been so much noise around the future of the halfback that it’s been difficult to separate fact from fiction, although Walker’s predicament in many ways mirrors that of the Roosters.  
  
  
He was dropped for two matches, but his injury has given some people the idea that it’s been much longer. The notion that Walker is on the outer doesn’t line up with the fact Robinson has spent hours with him in one-on-one sessions in the video room, or in the park, talking about halfback play.  
  
Young players get dropped no matter how good they are. It makes them better. Robinson dropped Latrell Mitchell and Joseph Manu when they were 20 and they became superstars.  
  
Despite the distractions and dilemmas, both the Roosters and Rabbitohs are still punching down the straight with one furlong to go. It will be a typically explosive encounter when they meet at Accor Stadium on Friday night, especially with a finals spot on the line.  
  
Yet powerhouses such as these count success in premierships, not finals appearances.  
  
Unless one of them is lifting the trophy on grand final night on October 2 – which is a long shot at best – this season will be considered an abject failure.",1693526496.0

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","I’m still going through that identity crisis as well.  I would say explore your hobbies and make friends with people with all walks of life.  Everything I did prior to leaving organized religion revolved around religion.  The congregation was my friends and family.  Growing up I could not participate in anything that wasn’t very family oriented or church oriented.  In some ways my life is more difficult because I do not have the support system, albeit conditional.  But my parents passing has allowed me to more or less distance myself from it and not feel so judged.",1693526496.0

Not necessarily, in the summer time here where the temp may not drop below 85 even in the ""coldest"" parts of the night, it's almost impossible to get any kind of prolonged sleep... you almost have to get so exhausted that your body shuts down for an hour or so no matter uncomfortable you are.

Which is probably a big reason that a lot of homeless people get drunk and do drugs in the first place: it does kind of force your body to shut down for several hours, although of course the long term effects are just shaving extra years off your body.",1693526496.0

"catalunya","t5_2s049","Lo que no entiendo es por qué una persona que se expresa tan bien oralmente en castellano (y, por ende, entiendo que también lo hace de forma oral) se muestra reacia comunicarse en ese mismo idioma.  
Los médicos en Catalunya no están obligados a hablar en catalán, y una persona bilingüe tendría que mostrarse abierta a que haya una persona de otro país/CCAA dispuesto a atenderle. Al médico vamos a curarnos, no a reivindicarnos. ¿O acaso importa más lo segundo?  
Jamás he oído que un Guardia Civil pare o multe a alguien por hablarle en castellano. Soy de Catalunya de toda la vida y jamás he conocido a alguien que mencione tal suceso.  
Nuevamente, en caso de tener que testificar, no entiendo qué necesidad hay de hacerlo en un idioma que un juez (que puede venir de Albacete tranquilamente) puede que no entienda. En la variedad está el gusto y la riqueza, por lo que una persona que no tiene reparo en definirse como bilingüe debería poder defenderse ante un juzgado sin rechistar.  
Gente imbécil hay en todos sitios, solo hay que saber qué batallas luchar realmente.

Si hay un grupo de 20 personas que hablan catalán y alguien de repente habla en español, lo que hacen las personas que le responden es ser educados y disfrutar de la habilidad de ser 100% bilingües. No obstante, puedo asegurarte que muchos catalanes no cambian de idioma ni a madrileños, ni andaluces, ni sudamericanos ni centroamericanos. Lo que más motiva es cambiar de idioma al inglés, porque eso sí es cool.

A vece se pasa por alto la educación y la honorabilidad a la maravillosa capacidad de la comunicación, y se desvía hacia la queja fácil y los movimientos masivos. Una peneta, la veritat, que el català és ben maco.",1693526498.0

Honestly though it would probably be people becoming more liberal, knowledgeable and well-informed of why things are the way they are. For instance, how fat phobia is rooted in white supremacy, how gender norms and roles today were informed by history, how bad slavery and colonialism was, etc. If everyone had solid proof of these things, people would most likely become less racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, islamphobic, sexist, etc. as there would be proof of various marginalised groups existence (trans people, autistic people, etc.) and how racism, sexism, etc. affected people throughout history and informs our current mindsets today.

There would also be tons of weird historical facts that are known by people (again, like today, but the facts would probably be more wide spread). For instance, like there was a scientist who decrypted the Mayan script and in a book he wrote he put his cat as a co-author. Or about Mary Toft, who claimed she gave birth to rabbits (disproven).

Microservices are generation 2 of SOA where you make every service a self contained function.  Docker came up with the ideal delivery mechanism for these independent components.

The first generation of SOA had ESBs like Oracles Service Bus (OSB). They sound great on paper, but in practice people tried to make the ESB do everything that might be common so services ended up tightly coupled. So there were some benefits gained, but they were canceled out by the complexity that came from trying to do anything with the single bus in the middle of everything.

ESBs migrated to the where they fit better which is  integration pattern at the perimeter or to help modernize core systems. Mulesoft Anypoint (formerly Mulesoft ESB) being a good example.",1693526500.0

People aren't going to cut the government a blank cheque, especially with constitutional change. There is almost certainly a ""ATSI Voice 2023"" draft bill sitting in Albo's desk, and people have a right to want to see it.",1693526500.0
"BaldursGate3","t5_12967t","The more I'm forcing myself to get to know Lae'zel and Astarion, the more empathy I feel for them and want to fix them. But honestly, they start off as **real** assholes that completely turned me off from touching them on my first playthrough. I feel like they needed a bit more reason to like them early on, and maybe not be so judgemental about helping people.

I understand their reasons for why they don't care about anyone else, but they also both strike me as pragmatic enough to understand that at the start of the game, we have no resources or friends and we desperately need those to survive. In Lae'zel's case, we need those things to even just get to the Creche. Even if there were just an early conversation where I could explain that to them in exchange for them not being so judgemental for awhile, it'd be a lot more palatable.",1693526500.0

They develop enough of a reputation, and students follow. Then, slowly, the style evolves by innovation (ideally) or decay (realistically, through imperfections in succession planning and intergenerational instruction).

In short, if you want to develop your own style, train hard, train long, cross train, get good, and then, you'll probably still not be good enough to have an impact sufficient to have a recognized style, but at least you can fight your way instead of trying to imitate a dead Asian person.",1693526501.0
"writers","t5_2r1ti","I honestly don't think this is even a critique. It's like saying you might as well set a romance on a space ship as during ww2 because it's still a romance. Which is true. At the heart of your story, it's the same and only the ""window dressing"" has changed but the thing is, the window dressing is what draws in the readers and that's ok. It's ok to want to change these things. 

But if this criticism comes from someone who's read multiple drafts, then I'd take that to mean you're not changing the correct things while editing. You need to work on character, goal, motivation, backstory, etc. You need to make the plot tighter, etc because that's what makes a good story, not the window dressing of normal human vs superheroes. You might also need to work on prose level issues. 

So it depends on who's giving you this comment and if you think your book has character/story/prose issues. Because you might enjoy a superhero book more than a story about normal humans but your reader might prefer a book about normal people and that could be clouding things further.",1693526501.0

All posts in r/PublicFeetPics must be taken in a public setting, meaning a place that the general public has access to. Also, your feet must be somewhat ""on display"" where there is a chance the public may catch a glimpse. 

**If we cannot tell whether your content has been taken in a public or a private setting, it will be removed.** This is up to moderator discretion.  Posts where it's unclear if the public has the ability to see your feet will be removed.

**Downward viewpoints of your feet on the ground or in a car are NOT allowed as it is not clear to moderators whether you are in a public or a private setting.** Simply stating that you are in public in your caption is not enough. Your image/video must show some sort of indication you are in public and there is a chance the general public may see you.

**What is public:** parks, stores, restaurants, vehicles, beaches, festivals, public pools, concerts, movie theaters, trains, gyms, work offices, malls, colleges/universities, any public indoor/outdoor events, etc.

My (33M) girlfriend (21F) recently gave birth to our daughter. The entire time she was pregnant she came up with ridiculous rules for when the baby is born. My girlfriend also doesn’t get along with my mom, so I feel like a lot of this was an attack on my mom. 

She only wanted me and her mom in the room during labor, this broke my moms heart. This is my moms first grandchild and my girlfriend didn’t want her to be there for the baby’s first moments. She didn’t want visitors immediately after the baby was born, another jab at my mom. She was obsessed with hand washing, no kisses for baby, don’t touch the baby’s face, etc. just a lot of nonsense. 

Well she went into labor, and I drove her to the hospital. Her mom meat us there and eventually we were all in the room together. I called my mom to tell her and she came to the hospital. It didn’t make sense to keep my mom in the waiting room when this would probably take hours. My girlfriend said no and told my mom to get out, an argument between them soon followed and it resulted in my girlfriends mom physically removing my mom. Naturally I was upset, it’s my child too and my mom has just as much right to be there. Around 30 minutes later my girlfriend was in active labor (We waited at home till her contractions were close, just adding this so the timeline makes sense) I went out and got my mom. This resulted in her having me and my mom removed from the room. I missed my own child’s birth. 

After baby was here I was allowed back in, and my mom followed. I picked up baby and handed her to my mom. My mom gave her one small kiss on the cheek and my girlfriend lost her shit. She had my mom kicked out of the hospital all together and when I tried to defend my mom she had me kicked out aswell. 

She went home with her mom and has been staying there, she’s brought baby by once to get cloths and such. I think she’s overreacting, it’s my kid too and I should have just as much say so. 

Her parents have both told me I’m a major AH, and I’m only asking because her dad doesn’t normally get involved, so I might be the AH.

* Granulated garlic, dried onions, salt, pepper, Johnny's Seasoning, honey, cinnamon, various salad dressings, green onions, soy sauce

* Frozen berries (like a variety bag), apples, bananas

My strategy with this build is to use the heavy weight of my AC to do a astonishing about of direct damage to my opponents. If they're staggered and a bit too far for a full charge on the pile bunkers, I'll go for the kick, which usually goes for a good 2k on impact.

Not only are you stupid for wholesale blaming the left for the existence of North Korea; but the entirety of our critiques of their government structure derive from the anti-fascist ideology that western countries possessed post-ww2 and then readapted into anti-communism rhetorics come cold war. 

All of your anti Korea critiques are Anti-fascism critiques.  Your being is so asinine and redundant that nobody who knew what they were talking about would ever bother making it. By your own understanding of the political spectrum; you’re critiquing North Korea for not being liberal enough cause they’re too liberal according to your own understanding of the dictionary (complete and utter dipshit).",1693526505.0

Sjugirov, Robson, Deac (who gets invites to tournaments in Romania, but not otherwise), Sarana, Sargissian. You also have people in that range who do get invites, but they're often people who peaked higher.

And as for Keymer/Prag, 17-18 is also a world away from 20 in terms of chess prodigies, 20 is pretty much at the tail end of prodigy status where there's still an expectation that they're likely to gain a lot of rating going forward. They're also generally considered much more talented than Niemann whether before or after this scandal, nobody is seriously talking about Niemann as a future World Championship contender.

Their **income adjusted** adoption fee is ~$26,000. For two middle class people who make less than $100k combined. I don’t even know what their take home is. But just an exorbitant portion of their annual income. 

This is nearly DOUBLE what I have paid cash for my IVF (we just passed 14k if you include our annual storage fee). And at the end of it I should get at least 1 baby. 

They might wait years and never get a match. 

But it could be worse. A friend of a friend is a foster parent trying to adopt her foster son. This is her 4th attempt to adopt, all of which have gone to family members. He’s ~2. He’s been with her since he was a newborn. She is his mom. But baby’s grandparents are fighting because THEY want the baby, even though their son surrendered/lost his parental rights.

Oh, I see. Wanting to keep more of your wealth or grow it is greed. Wanting to take from others isn't.

The classic special pleading of redistribution.

>If you sign him today and get, say, 8X8 and he goes on to get noticed as a true Selke candidate, do you think that's an option next year? Probably not.

If he plays better next year, he'll make more than if he didn't play better. No question. If he plays better but another player wins the Selke, he still gets that same negotiated contract. The Selke doesn't matter.

>It's not a secret that winning awards ups your bargaining power.

Except you literally can't think of any examples or anecdotes to prove that that's true. And don't tell me about the goalie who didn't play a single regular season game before the Stanley Cup run. There's tons of examples of guys who got paid less after winning that trophy. It's also not a personal trophy like the Selke or MVP. Stanley Cup is not in this category.


>it's the agents using it a leverage. It's how negotiations work. ""My player is a Selke trophy winner, pay up or we'll walk"".

No, an agent says  ""here are his stats. Here's how he affects your teams chances of winning. Here's how he compares to other players with similar stats and their salaries."" They don't give a shit if 150 media members, almost all based on the east coast, voted for him to win a Selke, lady bing, or Jennings.

I even passed on a couple full-time RE masters programs that I would have rather attended, and was offered admission.

The thing about RE, maybe outside of the mega institutional funds, is that most firms aren't MBA prestige whores when it comes to recruiting. They hire just in time and you have to network hard on your own. I did look also at some MBAs with that concentration and I think those programs oversell you on placement in the industry from on-campus recruiting especially if they don't have a deep bench of alumni tied to the school. Most of those programs have sprung up in the past 10-15 years so there aren't yet a lot of senior alums in the market.",1693526507.0

"blender","t5_2qim4","There are a few tips here:  


1. lips are not a straight line, they have a curve to them. Use references
2. You're missing important surrounding structures, the chin is nice to have but it's not critical. Rather the orbicularis oris muscles, depressor anguli oris, platysma, masseter, buccinator, and risorius muscles are far more important, a lack of a philtrum is also a problem here (in simpler terms the cheeks and laugh lines but please see an anatomical chart for further reference), use references. This also affects how the nose connects to the face which isn't quite right but it's hard to explain in a text comment.

In addition to references (both photos of human faces as well as anatomical charts) I'd also recommend looking at sculpting guides focused on anatomy, there are several excellent ones on youtube that explain a lot of useful techniques, as well as suggestions for how to build up these relevant structures (order matters, because strokes overlap).  


A notable issue is that none of these structures will look right on a sphere, you really need to put them on a head-shaped object at least, even if not sculpting a full face. A sphere is too curved and too even. I think a flat plane would be better than a sphere if you insist on putting them on a primitive, or a cube.  


Anyway, that's my recommendation. The largest issue I see here is that all the actual surrounding anatomy that builds the shape is missing, so it'll be very hard to get it to look completely right as-is.",1693526508.0
"ireland","t5_2qhb9","One thing that really bothers me about the US is the insincere vibe you often get from service workers, no matter where you go. Those plastered-on smiles, the feigned interest they take in your life, and the constant attempts to steer the conversation towards random topics just to appear friendly and hopefully receive a bigger tip... I wouldn't mind leaving a good tip if it meant I could avoid dealing with all that shit.

One thing I like about Europe is the assurance that you'll likely encounter genuine individuals. If they're having a good day, they'll be sincerely kind and pleasant. If they're having a rough day, they'll still perform their job well and get the orders right, but you might see them with a more serious expression. I have more respect for someone who can give me a stern look yet be straightforward, rather than someone who's continuously putting on fake smiles and only cares about tips.

In the US, service workers who rely on tips are officially paid well below the minimum wage... Is this truly the kind of culture we want to adopt here?

I used to always make sure to leave a tip for exceptional service here because I truly saw it as a generous gesture, not something I had to do. But, you know what? No more tips from me starting now. I won't go along with this type of culture anymore.",1693526508.0

Not to make it political, but their body, their choice? You shouldnt force treatment on someone or get mad if theyre anti-vaccine. 

Can you *blame* anyone for being hesitant to trust evidence based medicine? Whats evidence today, is falsified research tomorrow. Things change, healthcare and medicine have egg on their face from covid, there needs to be some time to heal and garner trust again. The media campaign behind the vaccine from multiple sources was.... interesting. How many times did the CDC suggest that getting vaccinated prevented infection? for it to flip to ""you wont get as sick""? still a great alternative to the ICU, but you have to consider the mixed message you send to non-medically educated people. How do you think the message ""dont horde masks, masking most likely wont prevent infection, we need the masks for hospitals"" to flip to ""state mask mandates in-effect for all enclosed spaces"" 3 months later.  a large part of the public feels betrayed from mixed messages from the pandemic. Arguably unavoidable, it was a very fluid time, new information came in constantly. but the *confidence* of officials at the time created some mistrust as things changed.

How many times did MDs write prescriptions for Oxy thinking it was safe? 

So yea, i let people be non-compliant. Its hard to have much trust in any institution right now.  What the standard of care today might be something we sue for in a few decades.",1693526509.0

What is the single worst thing that could happen on the trip? The kid also gets bitten by a bat (which is pretty unlikely to happen) and they have to leave early for a rabbies shot. Yeah its not ideal but it doesn't really sound that bad for me as a worst case situation.

OP clearly hates this place and her post screams of someone that is exaggerating how terrible living out in nature is. My parents brought me to a very similar place as a kid in Australia. We have all the bats, spiders and snakes etc. And guess what? I absolutely loved it there.

The only reason I am trying these is the longevity of the S22 was beyond terrible!  Just totally unacceptable!  The DR4 seems to position itself between hyper sport and sport touring ...I guess just ""sport""  whereas it seems to me the S22 is more a track day tire but idk.  Just before swapping rears (I am still running OE S22 front shame on me for this sin?)   I DO notice the DR4 sure LOOKS taller that is more knifey but how can that be if it is the same numbers 190 55?  Or are those really loose numbers?   Bottom line I NEVER had any ""chicken strip"" on rear S22 on MT10 but now with the DR4 I have a pretty good one  BTW similar thing happened with my tracer 9 I had just a tiny chicken on the stock Bstone T32 but when I swapped to Dunlop RS4 I had like 1/2 to 3/4"" for a while even though I felt I was riding the same....eventually either the tire broke in or wore or I got my confidence?  and most of the strip was gone by end of tire life (3200miles vs 2500 on T32)  I am speculating the same might happen with the MT10's DR4s....I'll gradually lean more and use more?  Not that it matters but in lieu of lap times and seat of the pants it is just one of the few things one can physically compare one tire vs another...but value?  like I say idk",1693526510.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","NTA - When I was a child I had an undercut and had the complete Batman set. Batmobile and bat cave included. I loved science and being outdoors. In my later years I crushed beers and skateboarded with all the dudes. Now I am the most girliest, princess a f dressing woman. 

If my mom had saw me acting like that in my formative years and forced me into being a boy, I may have just accepted it to make her happy. As I was a child with no concept of sexuality and most kids want to make their parents happy. Not angry or disappointed. It’s called being a TOM BOY! 

I am part of the queer community for reference but I really do not agree with what your wife is doing. Many of my friends in the rave scene were gay a f in high school and aren’t anymore. It was called experimenting. Some of them are full on queens now. 

I don’t think children should be having this conversation at 5 years old. I think teenagers should be allowed to explore and commit to being trans without influence and constant questioning from their parents. The ones who are trans will know and make their own decisions. As they always have in privacy without it being up to others. Acceptance begins with just letting people live. Your wife needs to stop forcing a label onto your child and just let him live. If he is trans he will figure it out on his own when he is ready. If she really wants a daughter maybe try for another child or adopt.

"cataclysmdda","t5_2wktw","good morning, thanks for the questions.

the version from 4 days ago.

the batteries are not draining, in fact, when i come back they are all full or close to full. (currently they are all full)


during the day the solar panel generate around 450. the windmills around 150 and the waterwheel another 180. it tells me the grid battery flow is +730

this grid battery flow of 730 shows up on every battery in my building that is connected so i assume all the power things are connected.

i have 4 things conntected, a band saw, a fridge and two standing lamps. only one lamp and the fridge are turned on.


i actually start to wonder if it turned off at one point because i added a new battery to make sure it does not turn off, can this be a thing? (turns the fridge off while loading a battery?)

the turning off is not very reliably to reporduce, it only happens sometimes, it happened 3 times so far always when i come back from a further outing (or at least thats when i notice it)",1693526511.0

If you use IHeartJane like I do, it is impossible to sort product by terpene values and see what has the highest Terpinolene percent, you have to click every product just to see it's value. I have a website that sorts these values for you, using it I found the following Vapes to have high Terpinolene values. I hope you find one of these recommendations helpful. This example store has Kaliburst #49 by Prime Wellness as the highest Terpinolene Vape product they have. Cheers.

An impairment, or a deficit, is not to just to  lack something completely. That's offensive (E.g. somebody with impaired intelligence does not not-posses it).

Not even the original work on that from the 90s by Cohen implies that.

"montreal","t5_2qnmr","Some of the small cities are better run than City of Montreal boroughs, especially when it comes to snow clearing in the winter. I don't have a problem with having a mix of boroughs and cities on the Island of Montreal. During the floods in 2019 a number of folks were pretty unhappy with the way Montreal handled things in Ile Bizard, where seniors and many low income people suffered greatly. I'm not sure it's an anglo thing at all. I believe Montreal-Est is still its own city. I'm amazed that Outremont stayed in Montreal. Talk to old time residents and you get the feeling Ville St. Pierre lost a lot being merged with Lachine and now Montreal.

For me the problem was that the mergers were imposed. If the cities themselves had created their own unified city, it would have been easier. Even today, Montreal's 19 boroughs have their own cultures and ways of doing things. I remember trying to write an article about city trees and discovering each public works department had a separate computer system. Outremont required an Access to Information request.",1693526513.0

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","So you're the type that thinks if you can't see it, then it doesn't exist? Idk if you're american, but currently we are going through a church vs state issue with the recent laws being passed. We literally have ""in god we trust"" in our currency despite claiming to be neutral on religion. Discrimination against race, gender, and sexual orientation has been *proudly* backed and claimed by the church.

Hate groups claiming to be christian, politicians harming citizens and guising it as a good christian thing, massive lobbying and tax evasion tied to the church- all of these are examples of religion being abused. 

The main difference between now and the 1800s is PR. No one wants to believe they are being controlled, no one likes the idea of a government enforcing one religion- but we go along with it anyway because it's subtle enough to not cause direct harm (unless you're lgbt or poc). Religion and money are like salt and pepper when it comes to corruption.",1693526513.0
"TwoXIndia","t5_3eg84","I m the girl who is told she is pretty but needs to get thin. I did get thin... and even then I didn't fit into the standards because of my love handles and tits. Basically I'm a 38dd girl with thick thighs... muscular legs... and the cutest little tummy. I have the weirdest body shape with huge tits... huge ass... and a waist that is tiny in comparison and gets lost In between. I wear a 30-32 inch Jean size but people look at me and assume I need a 40. I also had acne, I have endometriosis and that has affected my fertility, ability to get thin despite exercising everyday... so I knew there was no way out but to accept my body for what it is.... men look at my face and find me pretty and then they look at my body and go nahhhhhh. It's basically all good but only till the tits and doctors for the most part refuse to treat me despite me having chronic illnesses because getting thin is the solution to apparently everything.


Confidence- 

1. Decided to dress better. I know what suits my body type and everytime I get ready I take mirror selfies and actually post them on social media to remind myself that I m am absolute hottie. Getting complimented on my dressing sense has increased my confidence 10 folds. 

2. Decided to ditch the filters. Taking photos in natural light without filters has been so.... liberating. If I get a new pimple I make sure I take a pic of it and share. My insta account is pvt but I keep on posting about my ""real skin"" and how it looks with makeup from far and from upclose hoping some mutuals find that liberating too. 

3. Ditched the heels. I thought looking tall would make me look thinner. Nah. Not for me. Comfort over anything else. I m a proud sneakerhead. 

4. I remind myself constantly that my body does so much more than looking good. It sustains me despite chronic pain.. it takes care of me and oh god it slays

5. Finding the right bra. Idk why but this gives me such a lift. If girls look good.. I feel good. 

6. Makeup. I decided to experiment with and learn makeup. Natural makeup. Dewy... no makeup looks. Getting complimented on that helps too. 

7. Skincare. Decided to take a step in the right direction and ignore docs who tell me Getting thin is the solution. Found a skincare routine, stuck with it, cleared my cystic acne and viola. 

BASICALLY SELF CARE AND SELF COMPASSION. DRESSING UP AND REMINDING YOURSELF YOU FUCKING SLAY. 

8. Ofcourse the creeps on reddit, social media and the roads (including an asshole who jizzed on me when I was a minor standing in Golden temple waiting for Darshan with my fam) validate me a lot (/s.)

Finding my man- 

I've been dating my bf for almost 3.5 yrs now. We will complete 3.5 yrs in October. Covid relationship. Ldr currently for atleast an year and lived together for 2 yrs. Most days I think I slay but days I don't he is my biggest confidence booster. He is the man who finds me sexy and he knows how to voice it. 
My exbestfriend would constantly tell me how I can do better because he had a sports injury and couldn't walk without limping and wasn't your conventionally attractive dude because he couldn't exercise and stay in his jock shape after his knees broke. 
I found him on dating apps. Unbelievable I know. I got lucky I think. 
I found him because I decided to ignore what my ex best friend thought and focus on who he was as a person. I stopped letting people into our relationship. Their opinion doesn't matter. No one knows about our fights or our disagreements. Only us. We set some good ground rules. He's the sweetest. Cries when I cry. Validates me. I validate him. Took care of me when i had bad period flare ups and also sends me lots of food and even some for my family and when I complain I m getting fat he tells me  I m perfect. Motivates me to exercise. He's really good at that... National level football player... he knows the ropes. 
Also, this is a 2 way street. I get him flowers. I buy him gifts. One gift atleast every month. Order him food. Massage his head... constantly remind him how special he is. He does the days of valentines so do I. Get him flowers girls. He will love it. 
I don't believe unconditional love exists..there's always expectations... so fulfilling your partner's needs is so important. 

Tldr- confidence came from self care and found my partner on dating sides and managed to hold onto him by removing the burden of opinion from people, setting some ground rules for when we have a disagreement, communicating and pampering him, a lot.",1693526513.0

The majority of people believe they are fundamentally good. Now, there’s some cognitive dissonance trying to hold that belief while also being in jail, society’s place for the fundamentally bad. The way they resolve that most commonly is to assign different crimes as better or worse than others, so that they can still hold the moral high ground over people who have committed that crime. Pedophilia is usually at the bottom of the stack, but if you ask pedophiles in jail, murder usually is at the bottom.

This effect of placing others as worse is the coping mechanism. The abuse is then an expression of the belief of moral superiority. (Not the most logical but still true)",1693526514.0

I use the “Amish nail gun” technique instead. Hold the hammer head sideways in your palm, then hold a nail between your first and second fingers with the nail head against the side of the hammer head. Then smash it into the piece of wood. If you smash it hard enough the nail sticks and then you can drive it. Very handy when you are in top of a ladder trying to nail way out to the side",1693526515.0

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","Homework should be outlawed.  And teachers droning on about a topic at school should be too.  I don't know how things are these days, but I had several teachers that took the joy out of learning and specific subjects because they would just recite stuff.  The never stopped to explain why or how or where it came from.

It's bad enough that the school day is completely antithetical to child circadian rhythms, but sending any amount of work home after spending 8 hours at school is just demonic.

I think the first 30% of the class should be talking about new topics, 65% should be doing in-class work and practice on those topics where they can ask the teacher questions (instead of sending them home on their own and grading them for mistakes), and the last 5% talking about what topics the next day will cover so the industrious kids can go home and research it if they want to.

School is very much what the OP describes.  Grinding all the kids down to the lowest common denominator and turning them into the future cogs of the capitalist machine.  And it doesn't even do a great job at that.  I'm also in favor of a life skills series of classes in high school that includes things like writing checks (they aren't 100% gone yet), understanding loans, investments, interest, and debt, budgeting, and a host of other meaningful day-to-day skills.

It damn near fried my nerves, I couldn't sleep, couldn't stand up, blurred vision, vertigo with nausea and vomiting, couldn't stop twitching all over. It was actually quite painful. It wasn't until 7pm the next evening that I could sit up without vertigo. He severely underestimated its potency. Plus it probably didn't help that I barely used cannabis at that time.

"ahsokatano","t5_2v4b6","I hate this assumption, though I understand why it's pervasive. It's valid in some cases.

I'm old, and one of the first things I loved about Star Wars is that Leia was NOT a damsel in distress. She was a badass, along with Sarah Connor and Ripley. It's part of why I gravitated to sci-fi/fantasy. 

They taught me how tired the princess in need of rescue trope is, and I enjoyed seeing them overcome odds, learn and grow, and kick ass. 

So when I take issue with the way a character is now written, it's because I view the lack of challenges, the lack of growth, the stoicm, as a discredit to the women who came before, especially in sci-fi. 

Without failure, it's hard to appreciate success.

>I want to see a game that story-wise and maybe even gameplay-wise full of loathing for the player with the message being you suck as a person and that is it, no redemption, no future. Just a story about some people who are beyond saving. Kinda like Fear and Hunger in a way.

What comes to my mind are simulation games like Kenshi, Rimworld, Dwarf Fortress, even something like Caves of Qud. These are games full of indifference to the player and are very brutal in their realism. But they are all also very fun and have many different emotions and aspects to them - they aren't ""about hate"", they are about freedom in a world that doesn't give a fuck about you. And so with that freedom you can try and steer the simulation towards your own ideals, and be delighted or horrified with the things that happen along the way.

I would give those games a shot, because they are fun. The sense of shock and wonder I've had while playing them has gotten me through a lot of tough moments. A game about hate that does not condemn it does not sound fun, and I think it's somewhat contradictory. It's the old saying that the opposite of love is not hate, the opposite of love is indifference.",1693526516.0

You did nothing wrong.

After you said what you said, he should have recognised he mispoke, apologiesed to your son, and backed you up.

Like he could have just said ""yes, sorry, it does matter what you want, but we don't always get what we want"" and left it at that.

It's not like saying ""it doesn't matter what you want"" is an alternative parenting style to discuss. It was a poor choice of words, that you remedied in the moment.

Wait, what? Is there another one coming out in 4.1? I know the newly released Golden Troupe is hella good because of the massive Skill Damage boost, but I don't know if Yae will want it. Like, it's cracked, but her Burst is also a huge chunk of her damage. That thing has hilariously high modifiers for an ability that hits four times when all her Turrets are out, dealing a total of 2,018% damage. And I think they all have a separate ICD and can Aggravate, or at least two of them can. Regardless, going full Golden Troupe would fuck her Burst damage into the dirt unfortunately.

"HipImpingement","t5_2y5mp","I am currently 7 days post op so not far behind you. I am from Australia and our post op protocol is radically different to yours. I had right hip labral tear (very inflamed and frayed) however no impingement so my situation could be different to yours. I was able to take a couple of steps in the hospital the day after surgery under the guidance of my physio just to see where I was at. She concluded I wasn't steady enough so went to crutches but I am able to weight bear as much as I feel comfortable. At 5 days post op I went down to one crutch and I'm able to make small walks around my house without crutches. I have been putting equal weight on both feet since day one, and full weight onto my operated leg (whilst holding something) around day 3 or 4. When I see my surgeon next week for my post op appointment I may be able to go without crutches, but that is entirely up to my comfort level. Yesterday I went and did groceries with one crutch, popped it into the trolley while I wheeled it around and did a very slow stroll through the supermarket. Having said that I was driven to my suburban supermarket, not trying to navigate NYC! I am still quite tentative lifting my leg up onto things (bed, couch etc) but trying to flex my knee and move my leg around within my pain tolerances as much as I can.

As for pain, I feel it most at night and in the morning after being still all night. It is mostly a dull ache, I do have lower back pain that pulls through to my groin, I feel this is something that is more to do with sitting so much at the moment and hope it will settle as I'm able to move more. I have not started physio but do I have myself first appointment booked after I see my surgeon next week. I was told by both my surgeon and my hospital physio that I am able to walk and stationary bike without resistance as I feel ready but definitely no hip exercises for 6 weeks.

It's fascinating to me how much each country differs in its treatment. Obviously advice is given on a case by case basis, but all literature I have read from Australia in terms on treatment practices is pretty similar to mine. Good luck with your recovery!",1693526517.0

To be clear, I'm *not* saying we have zero crime, but that the close knit nature of my community changes the nature of random opportunistic crime, as there is better social awareness and recognition of others (victims & perps).  

Anecdotally, pushing back on the assertion that 'it's never happened to me'. Throughout my many years in Vancouver, I was a victim of crime on multiple occasions including vandalism, break & enter, theft, and assault.  Shattered auto glass being so common that many street parking (myself included) would simply leave their car unlocked to prevent an expensive broken window, or sliced soft-top (happened to my gf twice).

You're not forced to lock your car in your parent's driveway, you make that choice based on risk tolerance.  It's totally valid if that makes you feel comfortable, and I might do the same thing in your position!

"spirituality","t5_2qhc5","I mean, there's tons of instructions, try Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. But you have to be able to focus on one thing for a long time, like a book. Also, maybe read a book. The inner landscape is created by the image, by imagination. One must be able to see an inner landscape, something immaterial created by mind.

And then one spends a lot of time trying to overcome that, but we have to start with free thought, with the image, with the ideal, and focus upon that. Books, especially fiction, help us to learn how to build this internality. Culture has gone away from that and now everyone watches movies and videogames instead.

The mind is effing fascinating. Last night I had a dream that I became the manager of a young LGBTQ band, started handing out mix-tapes at local bars (I'm sure that's not how ut's done anymore, but follow me) and repping for them. Then had sex with each and every one of them, even the trans one, and my mind perfectly created their bodies—don't know how that's even possible. And at one of the bars, a guy got thrown up onto a table, and people began beating the shit out of him for crossing the line. 

No idea how this happens, I have dreams that are as real as real life, and it's impossible to describe. And my brother says he never dreams, or it's just random images that he can't remember—but he has never meditated, never crossed the line beyond what everyone's eyes present.

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","I'm not a writer, so I can't really speak for that part of the community, but I am a pretty frequent reader. 

For me, fanfiction is often a mean to kinda patch up a hole that the original media left(?)

Sometimes I just finish a game/an anime/whatever that I absolutely loved, but now it's over and there's nothing more to get out of it...but I also don't want to let go of it yet. So I look for fanart or fanfiction to kinda prolong the experience (if that makes sense).

The other reason could be that some part of the original source material was dissatisfying for me, or just wasn't explored enough, or maybe some characters got too little attention. And again, I go looking for fan content to see if I can find what I was missing.

So yeah, you could say it's mostly for emotional fulfillment.",1693526518.0

Look, Ali isn't the problem, your ex boyfriend is.   I'm not saying Ali is blameless, but you seem to be faulting her for this.   

And it sounds like a teenage ""promise"" to not invite the person they cheated with.  

Also, is she even going to the wedding, or just the Bachelorette party?  I mean, even if its the wedding, its not like you can't ignore her. 

You seem to want to hold a grudge, which is fine.  But you can't expect someone else to hold your grudge indefinitely for you.  You don't have to be in the wedding.  But deciding not to be in the wedding of someone you call your best friend because they are friends with someone you don't like is petty.",1693526518.0

"sewing","t5_2sczp","Alas, denim needles are no substitute for a good, strong feed, good presser foot clearance, good gears and good motor power.

Watch this tailor clip the cross seams for a flatter hem that's easier for his industrial machine to stay on track with:

 I do think you'll need a better machine for bag making.  The cheapest and most functional route I know is to buy a vintage machine that's 3/4 size or has an aluminum frame so it doesn't weigh 40 lbs.  This is one of the best all around machines ever made, and the fact that it wasn't tested only helps to keep the price down. as long as you have a repair person lined up who is skilled and motivated to work on vintage machines:

[https://shopgoodwill.com/item/176478595](https://shopgoodwill.com/item/176478595)

Repair in an urban area can cost $200 plus $50 for a new foot controller.  But the odds are about 70% the machine will be fine with just a new controller, oiling and greasing the gears, plus the machine has some of the stitch cams.  This is the same machine, which would run $350 or more by the time you found the cams, but this seller is very specific about what they've done to refurbish the machine, so that makes it a good deal:

[https://www.ebay.com/itm/126049079057?hash=item1d591c4f11](https://www.ebay.com/itm/126049079057?hash=item1d591c4f11:g:46MAAOSwumFk1tAe&amdata=enc%3AAQAIAAAA4M4UPkElOnwaUK5ggAdeRVbIRKINcHyyIJcaudC2E%2Fq5SV2nRzmnKFTmkoHDzVwL22xB7SoCMkkB8xsUoOEYkWtG4ue%2Fk%2Fy3aZGcn5Jj9JFkoKBUz3JIsv8ruxHZwgIdMC5DMhRyvbwTWHKpUVxwaEnmrEMCJyHoHJ9hBgFCf9IHR3%2FrtUKTQ%2FD1v6m%2F%2FxfZKpUx%2BxNpOZlb6IGg7S9%2FN4m81PNoDKLiuQ2FZBvPzDwTiK7%2FbZb0BphwXHBXEIMCv70F2e3gyGEnHFtEYzdC%2BbPZUx9bcKqduZ7qglWPB8sq%7Ctkp%3ABFBM4Mu438li)

Some of the work listed you'd be able to do yourself, some is probably too technical and requires professional repair.  

But before making any decisions, I would ask about machines for bag making at r/MYOG (Make Your Own Gear) as they will have the most informed advice for you.",1693526519

She went through a phase 6 weeks in of inconsolable crying for an hour before bed (we played baby hot potato between me, mom(with feeding powers) and both grandmas seeing who could get her to settle haha). 

Getting up at odd hours for long stretches sucks but that didn’t last that long for us (part of it is how we do sleeping). 

Throughout that whole time though we were both riding the buzz of this incredible feeling that this unbelievably cute and precious little human who is literally half of each of us is bonded to us for life. 

I’m really sorry you can’t find anything to cherish such as feeling the warmth of your baby in your arms. Seeing them smile up at you during bath time (we were getting smiles from pretty much day one - that’s hard not getting any). Feeling the satisfaction (and relief) as she settles in your arms or against your chest with a carrier. The sound of them happily sucking away on a bottle. 

I hope you do find some things to cherish. I feel really bad for you not having any :/.",1693526520.0

didn't like huy fong sriracha much, there is a swedish sriracha from ""skånsk chili"" which tasted nice or a bit fruity with habanero not very sriracha-like, really mild compared to other habanero stuff, might not be available outside of sweden though they got some hotter sauces but seems a bit much for me despite the nice smell. habaneri sound tasty but i feel like some might a bit much for me.

think cholula was a bit too smokey for me, i don't really like that.

been chopping some milder fresh chilis in frying pan, it can be nice. tried some piri piri but they didn't seem very spicy.

hot food seem almost illegal in sweden though.

beside chili sauces or fresh ones i tend to just stick mostly to salt and pepper mixes, maybe some dragoon.

making your own chili sauce seem pretty manageable, although it seems like i forgot to put chili in mine, one of them somehow got pretty tasty despite low heat.",1693526521.0

"UnearthedArcana","t5_384bx","Idea for variation on Mighty Impel for Path of the Giant Barbarian since the RAW is kind of a fail from the flavor/RP perspective:

>Mighty Impel - Modified  
10th-Level Path of the Giant Feature  
  
Your connection to giant strength allows you to hurl both allies and enemies on the battlefield. As a bonus action while raging, you can choose one creature one or more sizes smaller than you within your reach and move it to an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet x the number of sizes smaller than yourself. An unwilling creature must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) to avoid the effect.  
  
If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature isn’t on a surface or liquid that can support it, the creature falls, taking damage as normal and landing prone.    
>  
>If, at the end of this movement, the thrown creature is on a surface or liquid that can support it and it was unwilling, the creature takes damage equal to 1d4 bludgeoning damage for every 15 feet it was thrown.  The creature lands prone.

The main modifications here is that Thrown distance is now modified based on the size different.  Large throwing Small goes 60 feet while Large throwing Medium goes 30 feet.  The other modification is a ""falling damage"" equivalent added to movement that doesn't end with the thrown creature in the air, but it is tuned to be around half falling damage.  From a flavor/RP perspective, this feels more appropriate.  Smaller creatures are easier to throw and get thrown further.  If you are throwing something unwillingly, it will take some damage from ""tumbling"" even if thrown horizontally.  Something thrown willingly will be a more controlled action and therefore could avoid the damage/prone.

This definitely does increase the power level of an already pretty strong subclass, but I feel like the flavor/RP of it feels better.

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","Technically, it's ***not*** a diagnosable disorder. At least, not in my country (USA), yet. But my partner is a therapist, and he gave me a decent explanation about why, that I'll now attempt to repeat here.

Basically, here in the US, we're highly subject to the insurance system, both as patients and as providers. That insurance system requires every provider to give them a code for services rendered / diagnostics performed / etc. so that the insurance company can pay for their share of the services.

Well, for mental health, they standardize on the DSM-5. If a condition isn't listed in the DSM, then the insurance company doesn't consider it a valid mental condition, and thus doesn't list a code for it. So a therapist, if they diagnose you with CPTSD, would not be able to bill insurance, or show an agreed-upon set of diagnostic criteria that you met to come up with that diagnosis.

But your therapist can definitely diagnose you with regular-ass PTSD and still treat you and bill insurance, with the nuance that your trauma is not a single event. That's what mine did, anyway.

CPTSD is still pretty newly differentiated, so research is new, and it's not completely clear just how different it is from regular PTSD. And it's very easy for a single event among the long string of events to be traumatic enough in its own right to trigger PTSD in a person with no other history, so it is very difficult to disentangle PTSD from CPTSD. Especially in presentation, the two are very similar, so many psychologists disagree as to how different the conditions really are. Are they two separate illnesses? Two variations of the same illness? Two different pathways to the same illness? More research is needed.

That's why your therapist probably told you that. They could've probably explained it better than just ""it's not diagnosable"", but I think this might be what they meant when they said that. It might be worth clarifying.",1693526522.0

>Should I use a financial advisor/planner?  
Probably not.  
Many FAs are paid differently depending on what you do with your money, so they will inevitably be biased in favor of investments that maximize their commissions. This is especially true of financial advisors associated with full-service brokerages, insurance companies, and fund companies focused on active management. For most people investing isn't more complicated than picking an asset allocation and finding low-cost index-funds, so the best FA in the world will just repeat the same advice we give here.  
Well, maybe.  
In complex situations or when dealing with large sums of money, FAs can help you avoid making big mistakes. As a rule of thumb, consider a FA if you're dealing with $1M for the first time, or 10x as much as you have ever dealt with before. This is pretty subjective, so you can also post a thread asking if your situation calls for a FA, or if the generic advice applies to you.  
If you decide to hire a FA, make sure they are fee-only and advise in a fiduciary capacity, meaning they are advising in your best interest. Look for a fee-only advisor that is not directly associated with any of the investment options you are considering, and consider getting a second opinion.  
What does ""fee-only"" mean?  
There are two primary ways in which financial advisors are compensated:  
Commissions generated from the financial products they sell you.  
Fees charged directly to you. This may be hourly, a retainer for planning services (typically monthly or quarterly), or based on assets under management (AUM).  
The issue with commissions is that they produce a major conflict of interest for the advisor. Specifically, commissions create an incentive to sell clients financial products that produce higher commissions rather than products that are the most appropriate investment.",1693526522.0

I would then envelop myself in the bosom of the church. If we are transmigrating with Klein I would immediately investigate Lanevus, as I would know his current location I could tip off Klein and the others significantly earlier than what occurred. I would then find a way to leave for Megose's arrival I don't wish to court death even if it makes me a coward.

Having HLZNTL formed allows current talents to enter tournaments if they wish under a banner owned by Cover, and maybe attract talents who are more into competing than the idol route. Also, you know, sponsorship money.",1693526522.0
"bmx","t5_2qjv9","Yea you need a longer frame. I'm 6'1"" and one of my favorite frames was a 20.75"" top tube. Although 21"" or even 21.25"" is more suited to people our height. I'm riding a 21"" frame right now. 

Taller bars can maybe alleviate your issues as well. 9""+ bars are all the rage these days. Combine that with a tall top load stem. I recommend the Profile Push. I believe it has the most rise.

MacEwan is all the way in support of using windows in your early years and a Dual boot windows/linux in senior level classes.

You early years will be in Python where it matters less but then you will quickly move into classes where you use windows or figure out how to do everything on your own in your own platforms that the professor may or may not be able to provide you support on. 

Once you start getting into intermediate classes you will start using software that may just not work or work correctly on linux or Mac and you will be forced into the windows architecture anyways. 

And then in your more senior classes you will see a larger shift to more linux/unix supported classes while still also having windows based classes.

There is an incredible variation on the market, and I find *most* people who say that dildos can't compare to a real penis have never dropped any serious cash on a dildo and they're comparing low-end products to a human body, which is a comparison designed to fail from the start. 

My boyfriend owns a prosthetic that looks and feels, as I joke sometimes, ""realer than real"", and I say that as someone who has my own home-grown penis to compare it to lol.

If you want a dildo or prosthetic that feels *truly real*, be prepared to drop $600-800+.

Just because it's out of most people's budgets doesn't mean that comparable dildos don't exist.

However even dropping $150 on a Vixen Creations toy will get you something pleasantly squishy and nearly-realistic in feel tbh. It won't be the marvel of technology that the ones that cost as much as a PS5 are, but it will still be a huge step up for most folks.

>Step 2 - take a picture with said paper clearly visible. (does not need to include your face but does need to contain parts of your body)

>Step 3 - make a verification post and ping a mod to get verified flair.

If this is not you or yours then I'm afraid it goes against our rules regarding voluntary content and will be removed until you do provide verification.

NOTE: If you're comfortable showing face in your posts it's strongly suggested that you also show face in your verification post

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT delete your verification post, if it is noticed that you have done this you will lose your verified flair and your posts will be deleted. You have 24 hours to put it back up to prevent this.",1693526525.0

It is so fast at stopping/counter straffing I am having to completely readjust my movement it is that quick. It is great for deagling as well and you have a lot more up time shooting from a strafe wiggle. It has already made a big difference with AK and M4 performance.

But even so, I know that Star Wars has less than direct language, but it's usually technobabble or Leia being officious or Obiwan being grandiose.

I think the work 'expedite' more than anything is what got me. That and 'urgency of our situation' both sound like modern corporate office speak or academic speak.

Also, the deep and more mature themes also missed the mark on the second one.

When heirloom’s first came out that gave a flat XP% bonus and where always like 5% better than anything you’d get in a dungeon while leveling.

"magicTCG","t5_2qn5f","So after quickly reading the article you've based it off, I'll throw a few more thoughts at you. While I may have a few issues with the articles assumptions and probably would have personally selected different threshold values for probabilities, it's an interesting exercise nevertheless.

1. I'm assuming your using the data presented in the article as aprori points to base your suggestions on, aka how many lands based on the deck size and most expensive cost. Perhaps allow this to be adjustable (89+m as an example)

2. Perhaps allow the user to set a land limit and show the probability of first available turn cast success given the suggested distribution for the uploaded list. Especially when you aren't expecting to cast certain cards normally. 

3. Create some standard test cases to give yourself a baseline on your algorithm. They don't have to be realistic or even follow the rules but should have a point. Such as a) 80 ornithopters, b) 80 llanowar elves, etc.

4. Put in an Easter egg for gleemax, no way I'm adding 3130031 lands",1693526527.0

The intentional ignorance is a sin itself. I would have to think about it more to tell you how to judge if it is grave or not. If your conscience is telling somethibg is a grave sin, but you wilfully avoid any validation to justify continuing that sin, that sounds like a grave case of intentional ignorance.

Thank you for posting to r/SexSells! There has been a recent **increase in scamming from unverified sellers** who will contact users through their buy ads. For your own safety, only work with sellers who are verified on our subreddit. Moderators will be unable to help you if you work with unverified sellers. 

To ensure someone is verified: Ask every seller **to comment on your thread** and check that they have Verified Seller or Trusted Seller flair before continuing. If they won't comment, they are unverfied or banned. [Message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSexsells) with any questions about a user. **DO NOT SEND PAYMENT** until you have seen for yourself that a user is verified. There are MULTIPLE serial scammers going around who will offer to personally verify and/or have VERY convincing profiles, IT IS A SCAM!!   

**DO NOT WORK WITH UNVERIFIED SELLERS FOR ANY REASON!! If you message us saying you were scammed by someone unverified we cannot help you.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","Like others have said, Charisma is  more than just being likable, so Tieflings shouldn’t be excluded from having a bump to charisma for being disliked and mistrusted by most. I see your point though that, if a group of people is generally better at swaying others and has a few hundred years to work at it, why do most other people *still* mistrust and dislike them?

The explanation that makes the most sense to me is the general perception that Tieflings have ties to the infernal and thus evil tendencies. Even if a specific person is generally likeable, if there’s something about them that specifically makes you mistrust and dislike them, then no amount of charm and persuasion will just overcome that. Writ large, the general perception that tieflings have infernal origins, connections, and tendencies means that societies will generally view them with that lens first even if tieflings can be quite charming (and perfectly capable of being good, evil, or anything inbetween because they’re just people and judging them by the alleged actions of their forebears is just prejudice).",1693526528.0

Some people react unpredictably when they see lights, so if there was not a need to move traffic, we would keep them off.  However, when we came to a red light, we would then turn the lights on, wait for traffic to stop, and then proceed.

We're into like 10 paragraph replies here with like a dozen points, ones that seem silly or uninteresting to me, or which just sound like nonsense I can't even interface with, are gonna get overlooked, but I'll try to reply to all your points in this one. Just to be neighborly.

&#x200B;

Moving on: 

""Go try that on a feminist sub"" 

If I went acting like an aggressive dick on a feminist sub I would probably get banned pretty quick. Yeah. I don't even need to test it, I can speed run feminist sub banning in like 5 min I'm sure.

But.... I don't know what you're getting at with that..... I've also been banned from incel subs and redpill subs and trumper subs and radical leftie subs and christian subs and anarchist subs in the past. It's not like banning people who challenge your worldview in a dickish way is something unique to feminists. So I dunno what that is supposed to prove. Like....name pretty much any demographic and I can go act like a dick and get banned. I don't get it.

But why am I here and not in feminist subs? Well the vast majority of average feminist subs I wouldn't go stirring shit and attacking cause I think they are mostly right and agree with them. I don't tend to get in disagreements with people on topics I agree with them on....that should go without saying....But I have stirred up shit in, and gotten kicked out of, radfem subs before.....does that help? Again I'm not really sure what the point you're trying to get at there.

&#x200B;

Does that meet your criteria to reply? If I just concede you are right that I could pretty easily get banned from a feminist sub?

&#x200B;

Now to the thing I find actually interesting in this conversation. Your notion that you are attacked or belittled or in some way like, ill done by because you are a man. I have never experienced this. I am seriously trying hard and scouring my memory for any actual real life encounter I've ever had where some aspect of my masculinity or manhood was unfairly or unjustly criticized or condemned or vilified or anything. And I am really struggling to come up with anything. So if it has happened to me it must be so rare and so minor that I'm not even really registering it.

So, I ask again, why do you think that is? Why are you out here telling me its constant and happens all the time, and I'm struggling to think of even one good example? The way you make it sound I should have dozens or hundreds of such examples, but I'm coming up empty. 

How about this, why don't you give me an example of what you're talking about. Actual real world really happened personally to you time when feminism and the vilification of masculinity or whatever happened to you and cause you harm or to be treated unfairly. I'd love to hear what this is actually supposed to look like in real life. If it's so bad you want to flee the country then it must happen to you al the time, so I assume you'll have lots of good examples for me.

"" You claim western women and our culture and doesn't attack men but can you give me an example of positive masculinity in our culture ""

Uh....yeah, how many examples you want? I could list hundreds, lemme start with just the first twenty that come to mind:

1 (well like 10, but we will count it as 1) Most of the male characters in Lord of the Rings, tender, loving, artistic, wise, patient, gentle, lovers of nature and growing things and fine art, but also warriors and great leaders.

2 mister rogers

3 bob ross

4 forrest gump

5 Tom Hank's character in Saving Private Ryan

6 Holmes and Watson as portrayed by Downey and Law, and other than a few things that are very much ""of their time"" most of the original written portrayals of the characters

7 The dad in Bluey (not relevant to you and me, but a positive non-toxic male role model for little boys)

8 Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird

9 Tristen and Robert De Niro pirate guy from Stardust

10 Jean Luc Picard

11 Want some anime? How about Ashitaka from Princess Monoke. Badass, able to slay demons, but seeking first to calming and humbly understand and bring peace.

12 Most incarnations of the Doctor from Doctor Who

13 Ben and Chris from Parks and Rec

14 Many/most of the main male characters from West Wing

15 Lord Grantham and Matthew from Dowton Abbey

16 Maybe you're like ""There are no hyperviolent action movies here"" well then I give you King Schultz from Django unchained

17 Djin Jarin from the Mandalorian

 18 Chris Evans Captain America

19 Wash from Firefly

20 Several of the male characters in Stranger Things, Steve, Hop, Doug, Eddie

"nuzlocke","t5_2setk","My personal rules are given infinite time without cheats, anything that could be accomplished I am allowed to hack in, in reality this usually means infinite berries that can be grown or coveted, evolution stones in plat or other items I could get from the underground, rare candies etc. I don't EV train usually unless there's an ev trainer like in Ren plat.

The first game I nuzloked was fire red omega, then Ren plat, I had never nuzloked a base game until just last week (emerald) and for my renegade platinum first go I pretty much just learned and mastered the first part of the game to where I could get to Mars in my sleep almost regardless of encounters. I died. A lot. Reading documentation is important and just having a plan, the marriland* pokemon team builder is super helpful I have the first half of the games boss fights saved and use it to team build. Nuzeloke trackers are also nice to use so you don't miss encounters.

 I think learning to sacrifice mons you don't need for tempo is super helpful, you can very easily lose a bad or expired mons (most bugs in the later game for example, just mons past their use point) in each gym fight and have an Elite 4 viable team at the end, but if you lose 8 good mons you may struggle to put a final team together. You can only bring 6 mons to the E4 at the end of the day and usually will have a box full of trash pokemom.",1693526531.0

She's expecting you to perform like the people she watches. That's just not fair. Your can't do what the people in the porn does. It's just not realistic of her you expect that. It's fine to try things that are viewed in porn, but the expectations need to be lowered. I've done that with my husband. He's come to me with suggestions I know he got from watching porn such as positions and a daddy kink (he still denies he watches porn, but I'm not stupid). We've tried some things and it's been fun just trying. There are no expectations as we are not porn actors not are we experienced in some of those contorted positions. We are clumsy at times too.  It's honestly a lot of fun to try new things despite our many attempts and failures. 

Your gf is not mature enough to accept the fun moment and has set the bar too high for you which just sets you up for failure and her disappointment.",1693526531.0

Até lá mal sabia o que era trabalhar e focar-me no futuro, ter respeito pela família num sentido verdadeiro, e ter uma postura de quem quer construir uma boa autoestima e com isto assumir auto-responsabilidade total.

Foi também na altura em que comecei a conseguir olhar uma mulher nos olhos, sem esforço, sentindo genuinamente a maneira como a sua presença feminina é incrivelmente curativa para mim, enquanto homem; sem deixar que a parte sexual domine a ligação que tenho a ela.

E com isto agora vos digo, não por ser a minha opinião, mas sim porque SEI o que digo:

"community","t5_2qu49","Sure thing dude. I wouldn't say it's so much based on her being a bad person as being treated like she's one of the nicest characters and seemingly getting away with a lot due to her sweetness. 

I don't find her terribly intelligent. She is very able to manipulate people and that definitely requires some brains but that's the only real sign of raw brain power I see, though my memory may simply be failing me. We never hear of Annie having an innate understanding of any particular topic, she just works hard enough to understand things. This is an admirable trait but, in my opinion, it makes her learned and motivated/disciplined rather than innately intelligent. What really drives this idea for me, however, is that I have zero ideas of Annie's views on life, love and the universe. You'd think that all the things she's learned would allow her to extrapolate some really interesting ideas on things. Jeff's studies of appealing human nature lead him to provide some extremely interesting ideas in his big speeches. When Abed zooms in on a topic, he comes up with conclusions that change how I view those topics. Britta throws so many ideas at the table that a fair few of hers are actually really interesting, though that may be because a broken clock is right twice a day. These are the three characters who are most often used as a mouthpiece for the writers' ideas but it makes no sense to make Annie and Shirley the valedictorian frontrunners when neither seem particularly  intelligent in group discussion compared to Jeff, Abed and season 1 Britta. There are plenty of subjects in a university that require an ability to come up with your own ideas. I struggle to believe Annie would score too high on any of her humanities credits unless those subjects are taught v differently in Greendale. Obviously her lack if ideas can be partially attributed to being very unworldly like most ppl who've only just escaped the bubble of their school. But it's not like people with original thoughts gain that ability magically at age 30 or whenever. They still have some of their interesting perspectives in early adulthood but with more missteps, at least to my understanding. I don't know whether or not to gives her points for problem solving skills for the various episodes where she goes solving some mystery with Jeff. I don't remember enough of those episodes to say, but she may prove herself smarter than I'm making her sound here in those eps. 

Honestly this normal level of intelligence imo wouldn't annoy me so much if she treated like she were so smart. She also doesn't seem to be motivated by a desire for knowledge or understanding of topics and the world and what not, but instead simply satisfying authority figures and her own self-image. This is probably most clear in her pettiness when her brains are challenged, especially by Annie Kim but also Shirley. I get that it's down to insecurity, but it's an insecurity she rarely gets challenged about compared to the insecurities of Jeff and Britta. We never talk about just how arrogant she looks in her assumptions that she's simply smarter than the rest of the group, which certainly would not be tolerated in a real world friendship circle.

This actually leads onto the lack of accountability she's given compared to others in the group. In my opinion it goes against Shirley's fantastic line in the pilot about the way we treat children vs adults. In the end, people treat Annie as someone who is well adjusted and smarter than she is but she's still able to pull the sweet little girl card, especially obvious in Jeff's analysis of her mannerisms after she gets Chang fired, whenever she fucks up and gets less flak than characters with less of an understanding of how to be socially palatable like Britta and Pierce (obviously i do still think Annie is a better person than Pierce). This aspect of my dislike of Annie definitely has something to do with a feeling I have about the real world. Throughout my life as an autistic guy who has been told how different he is since childhood and has since revelled in being different at most opportunities, I have noticed that I often receive more backlash than people doing worse things because I do said bad things in a less palatable way to other people. This isn't to say I don't deserve accountability and I really don't wanna be a guy who enjoys on seeing bad people punished because my judgment of bad people is as flawed as anyone's. However, it makes me sad to see people who believe themselves to accept me as I am are actually still judging me, and presumably many others, for my palatability rather than how good a person I am. I think a great example of this in the show is the way that the group gaslight Britta into thinking she's wrong about her parents in season 6. She's been wrong so many times that the group dismiss her and see who they want to see in her, just as they do with a lot of her surprisingly good psychological takes and the odd good political take that she delivers too aggressively for it to land. Meanwhile, Annie is probably the most socially palatable of the seven. She is sweet, attractive, hardworking, feminine, smart but not in a challenging way. Her arrogance might be seen as less tolerable if Jeff didn't outshine her so much in that department. She's probably the best at fitting in, and maybe I envy her for that somewhere in my heart even though I know that's not what I really want. After all, it's impossible to write sth like this without it being drenched in personal bias. I don't dislike her for fitting, but seeing how it helps her get so much less accountability than the rest of the group is infuriating.

Another thing I never see addressed, why was season 6 Annie so mean to Britta? I get that it's frustrating when a roommate doesn't pill their weight rent-wise and, if it were just a random new flatmate, I'd be on her side. But they took in their homeless friend who they all knew was terrible with money while she and Abed were already getting by paying the place themselves. They can't have seriously thought letting Britta in was a great way to save money? I'd be mad too but she got so damn condescending towards her, especially the black nails thing at Garrett's wedding, and it felt like there was underlying resentment there.

Thanks for reading my opinion, or however much you had time for. Obviously this is a very biased take and you may have noticed at some point that Britta is my favourite character, and that I find her extremely relatable, and idk if that skews my opinion. Nonetheless I think plenty of my points stand, and I know that there is already a circulated fan theory that Annie is not that smart which I subscribe to.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Anyone who judges you merely with pejoratives (without being clear on what they don't like) isn't really helping. Pejoratives are best for mud-slinging or just really pointing out what a horrible thing someone has done (when they have actually done it).

Being a ""Stacey"" or ""Karren"" isn't an actual psychological term much less a personality trait.

I love name-calling as much as anyone but I prefer to pick my targets. I really, REALLY, love picking my targets with clarity.

Similarly, I dislike making generalizing errors -- like saying ""all women"" or ""all men"". I prefer to be specific and clear. I am not above being mean when I am being specific but even there I feel it is healthier not to be (most of the time... there are times!)

I check myself on that quite a bit, actually. As a gay lady, I don't have romantic relationships with men and often find myself being quite glad about it. But I do have very close relationships with some men who are really great friends. In the end, we're all just people. I don't want to be unfair where it is unwarranted -- and I've had my share of toxic girlfriends.

When it's warranted I usually lead with what I dislike about a person's behavior. I like thinking people can change. I'm not afraid of letting them know how I feel though.

The flip side is if I am relating to someone who is dealing with emotions. I'll just let slurs and outbursts slide because sometimes we all feel bitter and overwhelmed and just need a safe place to vent.

In the end, toxic is toxic.",1693526532.0

Once you get over the mental hoop start adding weights into the mix, such as dumbbells. I would get an adjustable vinyl one that way you can adjust the weight as needed, maybe one that goes from 10-40 lbs. look around online for good workouts to do with said weights as the fastest way to gain muscle is resistance training. And for the posture and mannerisms; don’t walk daintily. Walk kinda wide with a swagger/like a slob. Sit with your legs spread and not closed or crossed. i naturally act very dainty so if I force myself to do things kind of lazily it usually works.

"AusFinance","t5_2uo3q","First, sorry for your loss.

If it were me the focus would be on preserving the value of the house so you can keep it for maximum enjoyment or sell it later for maximum value, so this is what I would do:

- Get a prioritised list to fix over time with most critical and value-preserving pieces done first.

- Consider getting a small mortgage/loan to pay for it all.

- Put the $150K in the offset and pay the mortgage down over time, largely interest free.

- Live in the house while you're working through the list and dealing with the passing of your father.

- Then see where you're at in a few years. Keep it, rent it out, sell it, use it as capital for an investment property etc. 


The key thing to remember is, as you've already recognised, you couldn't afford to re-buy where you are, so in addition to your focus on the house, focus on the area, do you like it? If so, great. If not you may plan to sell-up, but the list above will help you get maximum value if you make that choice later on.

>Maybe that would be a coincidence? 100 people having the same hallucination? Seems like you're not giving much importance to the subject. Are you really trying to imagine the situation? Don't you think it's absurd to suppose it'd be a coincidence?

You're really focused on the coincidence instead of showing how you determined it's a supernatural miracle.

We would still need to rule it out.

You think it's lore absurd to think a supernatural miracle from your specific god is the answer.

>I can't imagine any. Like what?

I already listed some before.

>2 people already rule out coincidence for me.

Why?

>A stranger grabbed her by the arm, took her to the back of the store and started telling things of her personal life that she had never shared with anyone and answering one deep question she had been asking God lately, about her sister-in-law. The stranger was a woman who said she was driving down the highway, going to another town, when God told her to enter our town, turn to the exact street and then to the supermarket my mother in law was in and told her all that. We never heard of her again. Natural explanations?

Were you there? How do you know the story is true? Have you never been to a psychic before?

It's weird you think the only explanation is a supernatural one.

Especially because you still have yet to show how you ruled out a natural explanation.

You're really just getting close to fallacious reasoning.

Teaching is also a very stressful job, kids are often very rude, and legally there is very little you can do about it, so you need to not take it personal, because it is only a matter of time before they make fun of you.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","I work in the DTES helping the homeless/mentally ill/addicted. This guy was coming into where I work, accessing resources, for a few months before this happened. 

Every time he came in, I would describe him as catatonic. He could barely respond to questions, and only answered in one word mumbled responses... Always staring at the ground blankly.

I knew after I seen him a couple times, holding that behaviour, it was only a matter of time before he either, killed himself, died from OD, or go psychotic on some people. 

I’m not a psychiatrist, or a psychologist, but I pay attention to people… and every single person I met like him, inevitably exhibits the same behaviour, and meets the same fate. VPD standing around them, holding a knife, cops getting bored, and an inevitable bean bag round to the chest when he finally lunges.

This guy along with many others I observe, are prime candidates for institutionalization. Some harm others, some are harmed by others, completely incapable of knowing who they are, or whats happening to them.",1693526535.0

Smartphones can achieve almost everything the average person uses it for, which makes a traditional desktop unnecessary for the vast majority of people. 

Simply, many users aren't learning or applying new skills in order to use a computer effectively because there hasn't been a need for them to do so because of the technology we have today.

As for general purpose activities like essays, spreadsheets and PowerPoints, the need for a standard desktop is neither required for those tasks either as many turn to tablets to achieve those goals. They can be more or less converted into a general purpose laptop, further negating the need for standard computer devices.

The rate of one group owning a computer has never really correlated to how versed someone is at using the technology, in general the computing skills of the average user is pretty poor.",1693526537.0

One way you can tell this is if you secretly share with the person and dont want your partner to know or you hide your phone from your partner.

He should have been introduced to a plethora of foundational lessons, basically near an assistant at all times when not getting lessons. Comforting children is developmentally appropriate, so not doing that is literally the opposite of best practices. And new children need to be given time to acclimate. Once, and only once in over two decades as a Montessori teacher have I seen a child be asked to leave in him first week. That child was actively trying to attack and injure children. He ended up having a teacher between him and the other students. Each teacher that kept him from his goal ended up bleeding from scratches down their arms. 
I've personally never heard of demanding tuition for a child who isn't attending. That's insane if they won't even attempt to work with him.

"onebag","t5_301sk","thankyou this is very helpful!! i was tossing up  between fleece lined leggings and thermal leggings so i think now i’ll go with the fleece lines or look specifically for thermals that i can wear as normal pants. the thermals i was thinking were ice breaker 260 high rise so i’ll do some research to see if they can be morn by themselves. i do like the moisture wicking properties of thermals and the fact you can wear them multiple times before they get smelly due to this so i think i would prefer thermals. 

another commenter recommended I get my brother who is meeting me in novemenr to bring a bag with some more winter stuff and i’ll send my summer things home, i think i’ll do this so then i can add a merino jumper then and some more warm layers.

i do have a packable rain jacket that i was tossing up on bringing it not so i will now. also i will be bringing warm socks and gloves i just forgot to mention. although  i will likely buy the gloves when i’m there! 

i’m from australia so i’m not used to super cold weather, the coolest it gets in my city is maybe 10 degrees in  winter morning so i’m not used to layering for winter so it’ll be a learning curve!",1693526538.0

For me it would depend on my circumstances. I’m not sure how the schooling would work for you but if I had to keep money coming in or was still needing to work a job while going to school then I would just stay in the field. Start with a commercial company - some do both reefer and comfort cooling / heating and get into the install side of things to get how they’re put together.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Cool. For me, that's an overwhelming argument in favor of tighter gun control. 


A very large study in 2020 concluded that the guns drive the suicide risk rather than the suicide risk being some intrinsic property of the gun owner which is exacerbated by the gun. Just owning a gun increases the male suicide risk by 800%, and the female risk by 3500%. You can be the most mentally stable man on the planet, and simply owning a gun increases your suicide risk 8-fold. Maybe that's just 1% to 8%, but still, have you played a game where your critical strike rate increased from 1% to 8%? That's a BIG statistical difference in practice.


Specific preexisting risks were controlled for in the study also, so, basically: removing the guns entirely eliminated the suicide risk entirely. There's a whole vast portion of the population that **ONLY** commits suicide due to easy access to a firearm. Without that access, they'd never do it.

"neoliberal","t5_2sfn3","Apparently in addition to the age verification on porn, texas wanted to put a Texas Health and Human Services Warning banner at the top of porn sites that said

>Exposure to this content is associated with low self-esteem and body image, eating disorders, impaired brain development, and other emotional and mental illnesses.

Along with other things.  It was struck down because sexual expression was considered protected speech by the court, but at a moral level I'm not exactly sure this is all that different from warning labels on cigarettes.  If anything it's probably more valid than cigarette warnings because smokers all know its dangerous and going to kill you, but people who look at internet pornography are much less likely to know about the negative effects of internet pornography.

The obvious counter argument to this is that the warnings were overly pearl clutchy about something that isn't as bad as the warnings made it out to be, but I supposed I don't know nearly enough about the research into psychological effects of viewing internet pornography to answer that.

But if Texas's concerns about the psychological effects of pornography are valid, then I think it's dumb to treat this different from warning labels on cigarettes.",1693526540.0

"techsupport","t5_2qioo","The ***Factory Reset*** feature in Windows 10 and 11 is very flawed and is **not recommended** by /r/techsupport.

It often breaks with ""user profile"" errors or being stuck on a blue loading screen. This is because PCs load software differently than phones or tablets. Instead of a *reset*, Windows on a PC can be *reinstalled* with a Windows install USB drive. You can make this yourself.

You will need:

 * an 8GB or larger USB drive
    * this drive **will be erased** in the process!
 * a working Windows PC with administrator rights
 * the Windows Media Creation Tool
   * [click here for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)
   * [click here for Windows 11](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows11)

Use the *Media Creation Tool* to create a Windows install USB drive. Disconnect all other USB drives from the computer first, and be very careful which drive letter you select (use File Explorer to confirm) then follow the prompts in the app.

You will need to start or ""boot"" your computer from the USB drive. The menu may show a message with the button to press, otherwise try the F2, F10, F11, or Del keys. The USB drive should be listed.

The anxiety was gone by the 40th hour having free space in the house with open access to his kennel if he wanted to go in.  (He's spent 5 voluntary minutes in there.)

Potty training is still on going but progressing daily.   Lots of short walks, and taking him straight outside after an accident.

He still shocks his stomach with water as he wasn't given proper access to it.

Shedding was a problem at first, too, due to the anxiety.  It's totally at a normal level now.

"fantasywriters","t5_2t4ad","Yep!

I think the key word is authentic. And yes, there are exceptions.

All I'm saying is that is the story professes to be an authentic ""something"", even with the understanding that there are fantastical elements, things that are NOT fantastical, but not authentic, tend to take away from the immersion. 

And my stance is, if you DO choose to make some part of the setting authentic ,and that stands against modern sensibilities, then you are likely doing it right.",1693526541.0

If it is stressing ya out, yeah maybe it's time to switch but a lot of it is overblown and biased towards hearing about the theft stories obviously cause there isn't a story if there isn't a theft.  

I certainly wouldn't get rid of a car I drive infrequently simply on the basis it might get stolen, or even on the basis that it might get stolen over another one of my vehicles. There would have to be severely stronger financial or emotional factors at play.

"teaching","t5_2qyj9","I am reluctant to sound like the ""old lady,"" but I long-ago felt video games were training our minds to run on someone else's track, laid out by a programmer and meant to engage, entertain and inspire continued play. Because of this, students learn to thrash around until an answer reveals itself. They don't make an effort, usually - although bright kids do use reasoning and strategy. Most kids just do things incorrectly until one works. These guys use cheat codes to skip ahead in games or reveal additional powers that make things easier, usually by buying the codes or talking to others online who already bought them. If you play a game, it has been created by someone else. You run on their track. Sure, there are people who master the games through perseverance and intellect, but they are still mastering someone else's program - admittedly,  it could be a complicated art piece, but it could also be a casino-modeled cash machine. Then, the kids come to school and are told to read, to master math fact memorization, to analyze what someone else said without the interpretation popping up at the side of the screen. Our kids aren't students any longer, they are users, players - and we can't give them flashing lights and sound effects and infinite do-overs that they get in a game. They don't worry about our ""points,"" especially when we don't grade homework, and the lowest grade we can give is a 50, no matter what. Video games are not the problem. That's not my point. The problem is how fun and entertaining they are, and how much time kids have playing them. Real life thinking just can't compete.",1693526542.0

I believe there are some countries that require you to retrieve your luggage, go through customs and immigration, then check your luggage on to the next destination. 

Then, it's not your final destination, but your first stop in the final country that is where you'll go through customs and immigration.

I have had a lot of similar symptoms for many years, which I kept attributing to other things because ultrasounds and blood work came back normal.  2022 was a tough year healthwise, and I was getting pretty scared.  I got a virus that was covid like, but my home test said negative, but both my pcp and surgeon believed it was covid.  That virus started the worst 3 months ever.  During that time, out of desperation, I went gluten-free, low sugar, high veggie, and went on long walks/hikes daily.  I started feeling better slowly, and by the time I had gotten my HIDA scan, I only had mild rib/back pain.  I assumed that I was on the mend, so I was shocked that my scan showed an ef of 0%.  It took me 6 months to decide on surgery which happened 6 days ago.  I feel mostly pretty good, but my rib and back hasn't gone away.  I've read other people saying that it was gone when they came to, so I've been worried maybe I had surgery for nothing....especially since surgeon notes say my gallbladder was not inflamed. ( I am still concerned that means this won't be successful but have fingers crossed)  I am hoping that I continue to progress as time goes on.

now In telling you ARGUING with sense and Logic why its an idiotical thing that you wrote but that many thumbsupped (Just to reminds you all what thumbs up means)its an idiotical things for 2 Little details:

 2 minuts of Cooking Is the time the toaster toast.
preparing spaghetti Needs10 minuts to the water to boil and other 10 for cooking...
and a pizza Need 20 minuts to Cook but 2 hours to lieven the dough.

"Terraria","t5_2sg5b","A recent Reddit policy change threatens to kill many beloved third-party mobile apps, making a great many quality-of-life features not seen in the official mobile app permanently inaccessible to users.

On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo to Reddit is Fun to Narwhal to BaconReader.

Even if you're not a mobile user and don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as Reddit Enhancement Suite or the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface .

This isn't only a problem on the user level: many subreddit moderators depend on tools only available outside the official app to keep their communities on-topic and spam-free.

[More information on the proposed changes can be found here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/14goyu2/what_to_do_when_reddit_bans_blackouts_hit_em_in/)

While the subreddit will remain open, r/Terraria recommends these communities until the protested changes are addressed:

"PowerScaling","t5_yrt2z",">In other words, Hades has mid-godly regeneration, which means he can survive physical and spiritual destruction via a more fundamental aspect of existence

High-Godly actually, Hades was capable of regenerating himself after his Physical Body, Soul, Mind + The Underworld were wiped away by the staff of Nike.


The staff of Nike is one of many Divine weapons that was specifically created to permanently kill the gods, this was shown by Uranus being slain by one of these divine weapons.

https://imgur.io/Dp0OsoP?r


The Greek titans also possessed Divine weapons during their war against the Olympian Gods, if you know about Greek Mythology then you already know how this war ended.


High-Godly: Able to regenerate even if your existence is erased and the reality you are within is destroyed. This includes the destruction of things such as their concept or history.


The Underworld is the reality where Hades was destroyed, Hell is a realm of God due to it being a plane of existence that was created/Governed by an Olympian God. Hades created The Prisons, Hyperdimension, The Elysium fields and the very laws of the Underworld with His divine will.


To Destroy Hell, is to Destroy it's very laws, the way it operates. Hades managed to comeback into existence even after being killed by a divine weapon (A weapon that was specifically made to bypass Type 3, 4, 8 Immortality) and the reality that he created/ruled.


Due to the fact that Gods are Conceptual in nature, with them being the abstraction of what they rule, Killing a god would equal destroying the concept they goverign. 


Hades is the embodiment of Death itself and the Underworld as a whole, 


Type 2: Embodies an abstraction, and can be resurrected or regenerate indefinitely thanks to it. Destroying the abstraction is required to permanently kill those characters, but they can still be affected without directly altering it.


Gods such as Eris, are incapable of permanently dying as long as conflict remains throughout existence. Eris is the God of Discord, Gods are the manifestations of their concepts/ thing that they rule over.


To permanently bypass Hades's Abstraction and Immortality, one would have to erase the very idea of Death from Existence + Destroy Hell and it's concept.





>Should be fodder for Dragon Ball. 

How so?


>For one thing, souls in Dragon Ball can be argued to be conceptual, which would give hakai concept destruction. In addition,

Not all concepts exist within the same Magnitude, some hold more power, importance and are fundamentally greater than others.


Based on what you've shown + what the forum claims itself, affecting souls in DB would only be Type 3 Conceptual Manipulation


There are different degrees of Conceptual Destruction, some weaker than others.

3. Lesser Fundamental Concepts: Concepts that don't meet the same standards as Type 1 or Type 2, such as personal concepts that continue to govern the object in question, merely on a more specific scale, or concepts whose nature is not elaborated upon. Case-by-case specifications and explanations are necessary for such concepts and examples, and they are likely not going to meet the same standards for abilities such as High-Godly regeneration that other concepts may. Conceptual manipulation of this type can be resisted by those who resist sufficiently similar abilities, even if the exact mechanics may differ.


Due to this, Erasing Souls in DB ≠ Erasing Gods in Saint Seiya, due to their conceptualization not being on the same level, Gods have higher abstraction than Souls in DB.


So Hakai wouldn't be enough to bypass the God's Conceptual nature or their abstraction as it hasn't been shown to be on that level of Conceptual Manipulation.

>hakai works on the gag cast of Dr. Slump, who no-sold

Ya mind showing proof of Hakai Erasing the cast of Dr.Slump who exist as Gag characters?


If you're talking about ""That kind of stuff won't work on Lord Beerus"" that wouldn't be efficient enough to prove that Hakai would've destroyed Arale indefinitely, it's a better argument to prove Beerus has resistance to Toon Force but it's not nearly as concrete to prove Hakai is on that level of destruction. Kinda flimsy ngl


>Secondly, as explained here (there's a bit of elaboration), Spirit bombs can negate Fusion Zamasu's mid-godly regen


You mean the Sword of Hope?

Because the page you've shown doesn't show anything about the Spirit Bomb being capable of Bypassing Zamasu's Immortality.


Based on the context given, the sword of Hope only negates up to Type 3 Immortality.

Hades has Type 4, Type 8, and even arguably Type 9 Immortality. The sword of Hope wouldn't be able to prevent Hades from Coming Back to Life.

It also doesn't negate Abstract Existence, so it wouldn't be capable of destroying Hades's concept.


Speaking of DB character pages, it even outright says Beerus wouldn't be able to get rid of Future Zamasu on Zamasu's character Page.

https://imgur.io/h2Q7T0z?r



Hakai: Is powerful enough negate Hades's Abstraction, can't affect more fundamental Concepts like Death and is likely incapable of Destroying someone with higher levels of Immortality based on that little quip Whis gave.


Sword of Hope: Is only effective up to Type 3 Immortality, hasn't been shown to negate Abstract Existence or Concepts.



If you're under the assumption of Zamasu's Immortality = Hades's Immortality.

You should probably see this


Abstract Existence is the ability to embody an abstraction, such as a concept, thought, or information, and being immortal thanks to it. This power has a variety of uses, ranging from a high degree of control over the abstraction and its manifestations, the aforementioned immortality, or even being unaffected by abilities that can't target the abstraction.

Embodying a concept is not enough to obtain this ability, an abstract needs feats or reliable statements proving that the concept they represent grants them Immortality/Regeneration or control over the abstraction.

Beware that the abstract nature of different characters can stem from different sources (rumors, concepts, possibilities,...), as such, being able to affect a subtype of a category does not mean a character can affect all types of abstraction.



Zamasu wasn't immortal because of his abstraction, he was immortal because one of the Zamasu's wishes for Immortality, Hades along with the Other Gods in Saint Seiya are Immortal because of their Abstraction + the concepts they rule over.

>But Israel only looks out for Israel.

In 1948, 1967 and 1973 Israel had its own Ukraine Russia war, where 7 Arab armies + Palestinian rebels attacked it in order not to occupy it, but kill all its people (can imagine Russia killing all Ukrainians civilians in cities they captured? almost all Israelis that didn't evacuate before the Arabs conquered their village were massacred)

You know what Ukraine did back than (as part of the USSR)? It was the main finance and arms dealer of the Arabs, sitting in another continent spending its money so Arabs can eradicate the Jews

Today, in Russia Ukraine war, yes Israel didn't cut off its arms and legs and handed it to the Ukrainians, but it did set up a combat hospital in Ukraine, send tons of conventional defensive equipment, sent Israeli commanders to train Ukrainian new troops, and used its position (prior to the war) as the only country that has good relations with both Russia and Ukraine to try to mediate a peaceful solution

Now my question to you is, what the fck are you whining about exactly? Like, what is wrong with you dude? This hatred towards Israel, it's unhealthy",1693526546.0

You cant just barrel into someone because they get in your way. I mean honestly... what was your plan? Just fly by the front of them within inches of the front of their truck because *""fuck em, thats why""*?

I cam see why the insurance company doesnt agree with you. They were already in the road, weol before you approached. The driver in the other lane clearly recognized them in the road and slowed down to give them the right of way and avoid an accident. Which is something you should do and is required in some states. I.e. You have to forfeit the right of way if not doing so would cause an accident. E.g. you video where you refuse to forfeit your right of way and crashed into them.

*""well they pulled into my lane""*. Irrelevant, they were already in the roadway with a clear direction of travel. You grand plan was to ignore that and not forfeit your right of way, even if it meant causing an accident.

An example similar to your situation where the driver on the road would be at fault. A driver is backimg out of their driveway and there is an obstruction stopping them from seeing the road clearly, with another driver traveling down that road, and the driver on the road crashes into the driver trying to pull onto the road. The driver on the road would be at fault because the idea is that you are supposed to maintain awareness of what is going on in front of you and always be orepared to navigate road hazards. 

This is similar to your situation because you ignored (or didnt see, which isnt any better) the very clear road hazard and instead of attempting to avoid a resulting accident you tried to pride your way through the situation. On top of being the person tl actually drive into them.

Im not saying that they are smart, obviously they should not have been crossing the road at such a leisurely pace. But you are definitely worse guven how this played out. You not only ignored the road hazard but also ignored the flow of traffic, of which was slowing down, and also seeming blatantly chose not to forfeit your right of way to avoid an accident.

I plan on seeing my psychiatrist after I know a little more. Unfortunately, the process of switching antidepressants is annoyingly difficult.

"indonesia","t5_2qkte","> DVR : Bisa pake hdd (storage murah) + Bisa kustom sesuai yang dinginkan + terlalu ribet

DVR dan NVR bisa pakai storage hdd. Bedanya kalau yang DVR itu untuk cctv, sedangkan yang NVR itu buat ip camera. Kamera surveillance yang pakai wifi itu masuknya ke ip camera. Untuk jangka panjang sih lebih baik pakai DVR/NVR. Memang lumayan mahal di awal sih. Misalnya NVR Hikvision 4 ch itu sekitar 750 rb dan HDD SATA 1 TB itu sekitar 650 rb.

Pengalaman pakai ip camera Ezviz C3W dengan microsd sandisk a1 128 GB, ini adalah ip camera pertama yang saya punya.  Microsdnya hanya bertahan kurang dari 1 tahun (mode continuos recording). 

&#x200B;

>Wifi : mirip2 DVR walau wifi karena butuh daya + wajib micro sd (mahal) + praktis

Ip camera dengan wifi jelas butuh daya. Jadi tetap membutuhkan kabel juga. Listrik PLN (sebagai sumber daya adaptor ip cameranya) itu nggak bisa wireless. MicroSD itu murah kalau dilihat dari biaya investnya, yang 128 GB hanya sekitar 160 rb aja, ketimbang HDD 1 TB yang perlu modal 650 rb. Tapi kalau dilihat dari price/GB dan juga endurancenya jelas HDD lebih murah.

&#x200B;

>Kalo bisa :  
>  
>Night vision (sebenernya asal listrik ada bisa pake lampu)  
>  
>Bisa nyala pas mati lampu

Ya, night color vision (tampilan yang tetap berwarna, nggak hitam putih) itu alternatifnya bisa pakai lampu. Tinggal beli lampu bohlam LED aja yang arah pancaran cahaya searah dengan arah pantauan kameranya. Jadi tinggal posisikan pemasangan lampunya supaya nggak lebih maju daripada ip cameranya.

Kalau ip camera bisa tetap nyala pas mati lampu yang dibutuhkan adalah UPS. UPS ini udah yang paling praktis kalau untuk backup daya. Meskipun kalau hanya untuk ip camera saja sih kurang efisien (malah ada juga UPS yang auto shutdown setelah beberapa menit, karena load ip camera itu jauh dibawah minimum load UPSnya).

Alternatifnya adalah pakai baterai kering (MF) atau aki basah (flooded lead acid). Tapi ini nggak praktis, meskipun lebih efisien. Pada umumnya ip camera itu butuh tegangan DC 12V. Dan baterai kering/MF atau aki basah pun bekerja pada tegangan 12V juga. Baterai 12V 7AH itu setidaknya bisa membackup sebuah ip camera minimalnya selama 6 jam (dengan menyisakan kapasitas baterainya  ± 20%).",1693526548.0

Is there anything you don't like about it? It's at 180,000kms and that's when things start to go bad.

Is there anything that surprised you, either good or bad, after you had owned and driven your BMW for a while? $2k uncovered during PPI, negotiated accordingly. The turbos have wastegate rattle but fortunately only on startup. The starter died inconveniently. On the opposite side of the spectrum taking it to Autocross was A LOT OF FUN. 

What would you tell other prospective BMW owners? If you're buying out of warranty make sure you set a realistic budget. My car cost me $9k but there's a potential to spend $10k ($5k for AT, $5k for turbos). Only buy one that was taken care of, don't buy from hoons or boy-racers.",1693526550.0

También hay algo de lo que poco se habla y es que aunque cuando son bien recetadas pueden haber grandes cambios y mejoras ( yo personalmente si lo agradezco mucho) el sistema hormonal también se ve afectado y hay muchos factores que tienen que ver con tu libido, tu estado emocional, mental, tu alimentación y MUY IMPORTANTE tu sistema hormonaaal, creo que todos sabemos que el estrés y la ansiedad disminuyen en libido, la depresión puede que también, algún tema importante por resolver pasando, alguna adición, desde la pornografia, hasta cualquier tipo de psicoactivo incluyendo alcohol, cigarrillo, comer muchos ultra procesados, no tomar agua, no moverse, en fin muchas cosas. Pero te recomiendo, MUY IMPORTANTE. VE AL ENDOCRINO. 

Yo tuve un desbalance hormonal y la causa más probable según lo que me han dicho distintos especialistas fue mi tratamiento psiquiátrico con antidepresivos, antipsicóticos y ansiolíticos, lo tomé por dos años. El segundo factor fue un desorden en la alimentación.

Sorcerer will let you transmute almost all of the retribution damage you deal into acid. Just keep a fire spell up (recommend Green Flame Blade) for Flames of Phlegethos.

Armor of Agathys, Flames of Phlegethos, Cloak of Flies, Fire Shield, Hellish Rebuke, and Shadow of Moil are your best bet for retribution — and require a lot of turns to get everything “online.” Thankfully, only Shadow of Moil requires concentration.

- Have Cloak of Flies active before combat.
- Turn 1, quicken an upcast Armor of Agathys and cast Fire Bolt or Green Flame Blade to trigger flames of Phlegethos.

Clockwork Soul sorcerer gets you something to extend your retribution damage from armor of Agathys and regular sorcery points. Runechild gives you damage mitigation in a separate pool.

Warlock 7 / Sorcerer 13 gets you Shadow of Moil and recharging 4th-level slots.

Warlock 5 / Sorcerer 15 gets you Cloak of Flies,  Runic Torrent , and 8th-level spells, plus 15 glyphs, 15 sorcery points, and recharging 3rd-level spells — but no Shadow of Moil.

So it depends on what you want to prioritize.",1693526551.0

I do see it everywhere here (and most ED subs, even some non ED subs for that matter) so I'm not really sure how happy people would be not to share that count.

What'd you think of like, people asking for recipes of a certain count? Discussion posts like ""looking for homemade egg nog less than 100 per cup"" or whatever. It is unnecessary to share if you're posting, but maybe it's worth allowing if someone's asking? Although I suppose they could also just find out what the recipe is on their own terms, and decide to make it from there.

I was thinking that part of why people share the count, and also why some people ask, is they want an idea of what something is before they make it. Lower counts do often get lots of attention. So sharing that number is like, similar to a business cost estimate? But like cost estimates, it's never really reflective of the final product. I don't encourage tracking, far from it, though maybe there's no point in even sharing the number when people may or may not make it anyway. Or they may not follow the recipe.",1693526551.0

"Switzerland","t5_2qhp6","So, let's look towards Russia and see if they violated any treaties. 

Since the 2000s: Talks about Russia breaching the INF. Russia denies this, the evidence becomes stronger since 2017/18. These missiles could be used to reach for example Germany with nuclear warheads. Again, Russia denies this, but they deny a lot of things.

Assassinations on the grounds of NATO states (since 2006). You will now say that the US does the same thing, but no, not in Russia. Imagine them poisoning somebody who dislikes their government in Moscow! All hell would break lose.

Putting the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty (CNF) on hold (2007), then terminating it in 2015, then officially leaving in 2023. Still better than just breaching it. Fine I guess. 

War in Georgia (2008). Invasion of a foreign country without UN mandate. Violates the Foundation Act and against UN regulations. Georgia is still occupied by Russian forces despite multiple negotiations for peace by western nations. 

2008: Recognizing Abkhazia as an independent state. Not recognized by the UN or almost every other state. Used to destabilize Georgia. Same applies for South Ossetia. 

Breaching of the Budapest Memorandum, the Russian-Ukranian Friendship Treaty and the Founding Act with the occupation of Crimea and invasion in the eastern part of Ukraine (2014). 

Russia breaches New START in 2014 for having too many warheads ready for deployment. The same applies to the US. 

Russia starts a war in Syria (2015) to help dictator Assad to kill his own people. Violates Foundation Act. Russia also preferably throws bombs on hospitals and civilian infrastructure. 

Russia deploys bombers that are capable of using nuclear warheads in Crimea (2015). 

Kerch Strait incident (2018): Breaching of the Treaty on the sea of Azov and the Strait of Kerch by stopping three ships of the Ukranian sea forces.

Russia sets standards for NATO concerning Ukraine that NATO simply can not fulfill. Russia also wants a veto on Ukraine possible joining and that's just ridiculous (2021). This is against the automy and souvereignty of states and especially you should be very much against such attitude. 

Full on invasion of Ukraine (2022). Again often targetting civilians. Before lying about it and saying that it is preparing a military exercise.   

That's not even remotely complete. 

Most treaties between Ukraine and Russia or NATO and Russia have been breached by Russia. The one that has not been breached by Russia was unilaterally terminated by Russia. If one compares the acts between Russia and the US or Russia and NATO since Putin came into power, one will find out that Russia has been much worse. It destabilizes countries, it is internationally not reliable, it frequently invades other countries and it's currently the biggest threat to Europe's safety and peace. If you think that Putin is striving for peace, you are wrong. It boggles my mind how you can support actions which go that much against your principles. You are either incredibly naive or uninformed or fall for Russian propaganda or just don't care or all of them.",1693526552.0

"mamamoo","t5_30c4e","I imagine the world tour also made it much harder to do the kind of work she wants to do. Also, her contract dismissal may have stipulated that she still had to honor it until a specific date. Despite them letting her do, they may have performances or shows that were booked before, and the agency is holding her to those, and she just hasn't had the time or resources she needs to do it right. 

I personally will take whatever I can get from Hwasa. I'm still amazed (not in a good way) that her song LMM and the mv (which is absolutely stunning) hasn't gotten more traction. Every YouTube review I've seen it of has been emotional and has the fewest pauses and commentary I've ever seen. So many reviewers ended in tears. Considering it's a companion to Maria, I hope more people watch and listen. As a result, that's both why I wish there was a B track right now, but why I'm  also glad she didn't settle or give us a performance that isn't worthy of her talent.",1693526553.0

You could ask for homework help with the entire assignment or just talk about the subject your professor teaches (professors are, after all, professional nerds).

Most professors are tired and overworked but want to be reasonable. If you show you won't take advantage of their kindness and that you'll put in effort, they're a lot more likely to work with you. And be upfront about the accommodations you need - it's what you need to be the best student you can be, and they should want you to be the best student you can be. Get your accommodations documented with your university's disability center and email every professor at the start of the semester saying you're happy to answer any questions they have about your accommodations.

Of course, some professors are mean people, but if you show that you care about the class and want to do well, you're making it harder for them to be mean to you.",1693526553.0

"nrl","t5_2qn90","**DOGS ON A SHORT LEASH**  
They say that eyes are windows to the soul. For coaches, it’s their hair.  
  
Bulldogs coach Cameron Ciraldo’s mane is getting greyer with each passing week, and only more so in recent days following the news of player unrest at Belmore.  
  
There’s an investigation under way into how a player with mental health issues could be subjected to wrestling with the entire squad as punishment for turning up late to training.  
  
But the deeper issue here is whether Ciraldo has lost the playing group because of the culture he’s trying to introduce. In other words, is he being too tough?  
  
From what I’ve been told, you can count on one hand how many players are disgruntled about the coach’s methods.  
  
Professional football clubs are not offices. They are not worksites. And they are certainly not newspaper newsrooms, although sometimes I wish they were so I could upend colleague Christian Nicolussi.  
  
For those of us who can remember the olden days – like the 1990s – the Canterbury Bankstown Rugby League Football Club’s success was based on them training, playing and partying harder than most.  
  
It was a privilege to have a locker at Belmore Sportsground, let alone first-grade jumper, and these are the qualities Ciraldo and head of football Phil Gould are trying to establish. They are one year into a significant rebuild.  
  
**THE QUOTE**  
  
“I have to watch the NBA Finals and they have ‘world champion’ on their heads. World champion of what? The United States. I love the US at times but that ain’t the world – we are the world.” – We are the children. We are the ones who make a brighter day, so let’s start giving … US track star Noah Lyles after winning the 200m at the world athletics championships in Budapest. The rest of the world has known this for some time.  
  
**THUMBS UP**  
Randwick broke a 20-year drought when it won the Shute Shield final in the 100th year of Sydney’s club rugby competition, beating Norths 17-15 last Saturday. Christian Poidevin was critical in the victory while the vision of coach Stephen Hoiles celebrating on full-time should be framed and hung on a wall in the Museum of Contemporary Art.  
  
**THUMBS DOWN**  
Spanish Football Federation boss Luis Rubiales refuses to resign after planting a creepy kiss on the mouth of Jenni Hermoso following Spain’s victory in the FIFA Women’s World Cup final – even though the entire team has stood down and refuses to play again while his mother has gone on a hunger strike. Give yourself the kiss of death and resign, old mate.

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","I'd do the following:

Add a mastery tree to power up the mount engage skills:  


* Raptor cripples to keep the enemies grouped for longer
* Bunny knockdown time increased
* Skimmer grants allies defensive boons (resolution, regeneration, maybe protection too)
* Jackal barrier now pulses for a short duration
* Griffon inflicts bleeding, user gets a short evade duration
* Roller beetle increases damage dealt per enemy struck
* Warclaw inflicts weakness and bleeding
* Skyscale fire field lasts longer  


This ensures that each has a strong identity to choose for engagement that's worth considering, instead of just spamming the fire field.

Let any mount be used in combat with the new mastery instead of just skyscale.

Let the user swap mounts on the fly without needing to dismount, which I think diminishes how overpowering the skyscale is as jack of all trades.

But also, like you say, a lot depends on map design. I'd have the map teams have a list of mount related points to consider when creating new maps. e.g. Why not have jackal portals between the bastions in Amnytas?",1693526553.0

The issue is that gall bladder and bile production adjusts to the amount of fat you eat. High fat diet may lead to enlarged gall bladder. After surgery the gall bladder doesn’t adjust production of bile, it keeps on doing what it had been doing. The excess bile first creates sludge and then stones.

We're all fools. But it hurts more at your age, I understand. I'm used to being an idiot, you're probably still coming to terms with that being normal.

Humans just aren't very intelligent, you know. Has nothing to do with you. We just tend to show others we're smart, our media tends to show us as capable, but humans are barely intelligent. Natural selection made is smarter than all the other animals, but those animals are really not very bright, so neither are we.

If aliens would see us, they'd just start laughing and they would be unable to stop. And then they'd ask ""how the hell are these not extinct yet?"" That's just something to come to terms with. You didn't cause that to happen and neither did I, we just have to work with it.

>I'm working on seeing a therapist, I don't have any high expectations, but we'll see.

Good, I think that's needed. I won't further tell you to do that.

>Regarding the tests, on the depression test, I got 22

Makes sense. There's a relationship between loneliness and depression (it goes both ways, depressed people feel more lonely, just because of the depression, they are more likely to isolate and be avoided and a bunch more ways).

>I got 5. I skipped other tests after seeing the results of the first two.

That's fine. You're going to get professional treatment anyway. Let's focus on that depression first and foremost and then a little bit on improving yourself esteem as a secondary goal.

Focus on the simple stuff. That will give you more capacity and strength in therapy, that way both self help and therapy combine their effect and increase the likelihood you'll recover from this.",1693526554.0

One consequence is an extremist comes along to make previously staunch Republicans look moderate in comparison. Kemp hasn't changed. W Bush's legacy is still terrible, but his favorability has gone up well beyond what happens when views soften over time, mainly because he looks sane in comparison.

One reason why Kemp has pushed back pretty strong on the election stuff is that he's personally involved, and his reputation would get hammered if he gave into Trump loyalist pressures and said his election was off by a whopping 11000+ votes. The implication would be gross incompetence, and he'd arguably have had a greater chance of losing in 2022, both to a primary challenger and certainly in the general. Recall also that far right governor Ducey [did not give into Trump's pressure](https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/01/politics/trump-ducey-arizona-2020-election-overturn/index.html), although I don't think there's a phone call transcript to parse. This doesn't make him moderate. It's just the least bad of 2 choices for him.

Now Kemp winning the primary so easily over Perdue might be telling but also note that big Republican donors and many primary voters favored Kemp heavily because Perdue and Trump lost them the Senate, in 2 seats that were supposed to be relatively safe. So the pragmatism vote played unusually large in Georgia.",1693526554.0

"SelfDrivingCars","t5_2udmw","The article title is clickbait bullshit. Every single incident involves other (human) drivers/cyclists hitting the Zoox vehicles, not the other way around, but the title makes it sound like not only were the incidents severe (""crashes"") but that the AV was responsible.

I didn't go through every Zoox report on the [CA DMV page](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/vehicle-industry-services/autonomous-vehicles/autonomous-vehicle-collision-reports/), but I clicked a ton of them and didn't find a single one where the AV was at fault. The reports are more like:

> A Zoox vehicle in autonomous mode was proceeding straight in its lane on Mason Street in San Francisco, CA when an occupant of a parallel parked car (Vehicle 2) abruptly opened its rear passenger side door into the side of the Zoox vehicle
[link](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/zoox_010123-pdf/)

> A Zoox vehicle in autonomy was stopped at a red light waiting for traffic ahead on Embarcadero with brake lights illuminated. When the traffic light changed to green, surrounding traffic began to move. The Zoox vehicle appropriately continued to wait for a stopped lead vehicle immediately ahead when vehicle 2 struck the Zoox vehicle from the rear. **Zoox vehicle camera footage shows the driver of vehicle 2 holding their cellphone raised in their hand** at the time of contact
[link](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/zoox_112022-pdf/)

> A Zoox vehicle was proceeding straight in autonomy through an intersection with a green light and right of way when vehicle 2 attempted an illegal left turn across lanes of traffic into Zoox’s right of way. The safety driver disengaged and applied max braking effort which allowed Zoox to mitigate but not completely prevent the unavoidable collision.
[link](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/zoox_101422-pdf/)

> A Zoox vehicle was in autonomy proceeding straight on Pine Street in San Francisco, CA when it encountered a double parked United States Postal Service van in lane (vehicle 2: model, year, VIN and insurance are unknown). The Zoox vehicle came to a complete stop while waiting for an opportunity to merge around vehicle 2. Vehicle 2 then rolled backwards into the Zoox vehicle, causing minor damage to front sensors and Vehicle 2 rear bumper. There were no injuries and first responders were not notified. Post incident review did not observe any brake lights or reverse lights on vehicle 2 while it was rolling backwards.
[link](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/zoox_100322-pdf/)

In a number of cases, the vehicle wasn't even in autonomous mode but was being driven by the safety operator:

> A Zoox vehicle in manual mode was proceeding straight in its lane on Kearny St. in San Francisco, when an occupant of a parallel parked car abruptly opened a rear door into the side of the Zoox vehicle, causing minor damage to both vehicles. The Zoox vehicle had disengaged for unrelated traffic within 30 seconds of the contact.
[link](https://www.dmv.ca.gov/portal/file/zoox_062822-pdf/)

At least one report involved an allegation that couldn't be substantiated and likely didn't even happen:

> Zoox received an allegation regarding contact between a bicyclist and a Zoox vehicle at the intersection of Harrison and 13th Street in San Francisco. After a thorough search of available sensor data and other internal sources, Zoox was not able to identify any such incident, nor any additional related information including whether a Zoox vehicle was involved or in autonomy.

"CopperIUD","t5_2oq6qb","As you can see here, there are lots of different experiences with the paraguard. I’ll share mine to add to them, but you will ultimately need to try it for yourself to find out. 
Prior to paraguard I had tried the pill, the nueva ring and a hormonal IUD for 1 year. I always hated and reacted poorly to the hormones. 
Insertion and removal was very painful for me, I learned to ask for both pain meds and anxiety meds before the appointments. I recommend doing this. 
Paraguard for me, did make my periods heavier and longer, but they were already heavy and long, so a little longer for almost no chance of pregnancy and no hormones was worth it for me. 
I had the Paraguard for ~6-7 years before I got it removed. It’s been almost a year since it was removed and I wrote about the post experience on a thread somewhere in this Reddit. The cliff notes are my periods returned to a little shorter and lighter, and I had some joint pain shortly after removed but nothing long term. 
Overall was fine for me and I’m glad I used that one. If I had to get birth control again, I’d probably do the Paraguard again.",1693526555.0

I'm firmly in the camp that says parents don't deserve **anything** by virtue of being parents -- instead they, like anyone else, are worth having in your life if they're a force for good. And your parents clearly aren't. 

My parents are both good people who do their best. My mom still holds a lot of negative prejudices about polyamory despite having all the information she'd need to conclude that she's wrong -- as a result I tell her very little about what's going on in my poly life.

Why would I? 

She doesn't get it, and has been unwilling to learn. I'm not going to invite her to the most intimate, most tender, most romantic, most vulnerable parts of my life if I can't trust her to treat it all with kindness and respect.

From your description, your mom sounds orders of magnitude worse than that by way of being actually abusive. 

This all being said, I don't even think you NEED a ""valid reason"" to not tell someone about your engagement. Simply on the overall balance not wanting to, is by itself reason enough. Nobody is **entitled** to know details from your private life.",1693526556.0

"MHOC","t5_31ykc","# Welcome to this debate

Here is a quick run down of what each type of post is.

**2nd Reading**: Here we debate the contents of the bill/motions and can propose any [amendments](https://www.reddit.com/r/MHOCMeta/comments/a7oun5/on_amendments/?st=JRKXUN8X&sh=7c7e701c). For motions, amendments cannot be submitted.

**3rd Reading**: Here we debate the contents of the bill in its final form if any amendments pass the Amendments Committee.

**Minister’s Questions**: Here you can ask a question to a Government Secretary or the Prime Minister. Remember to follow the rules as laid out in the post. [A list of Ministers and the MQ rota can be found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eCL0d4L9IFIiCl8G_2xXzxjIniA75pI_BEexvDBaRoM/edit?usp=sharing)

Any other posts are self-explanatory. If you have any questions you can get in touch with the Chair of Ways & Means, Maroiogog on Reddit and (Maroiogog#5138) on Discord, ask on [the main MHoC server](https://discord.gg/bmx5uJr) or modmail it in on the sidebar --->.

Anyone can get involved in the debate and doing so is the best way to get positive modifiers for you and your party (useful for elections). So, go out and make your voice heard! **If this is a second reading post amendments in reply to this comment only – do not number your amendments, the Speakership will do this. You will be informed if your amendment is rejected.**

# Is this bill on the 2nd reading? You can submit an amendment by replying to this comment.

Many Americans take on loads of student debt and medical debt. Childcare is also astronomically expensive in many areas.

Many young families are priced out of owning a home because many family homes are bought out by corporations, landlords, flippers, or boomers who want to casually put them on AirBnb. My neighborhood of single-family homes is now more than 30% rentals.

Cost of living varies *widely* but it's going up everywhere.

My midwestern family of 4 is quite comfortable on a household income of $130,000 but we also had enough generational wealth to avoid student debt, which also allowed us to start saving much sooner. Many people don't have that privilege.",1693526558.0

"OnePiece","t5_2rfz5","I think the LA and original have different vibes and different charm. I absolutely LOVED the interactions between Zoro and Luffy, it built the first mate-captain dynamic really well. Besides that, smaller interactions too, like Zoro and Nami doing the shots game.

The fights are something I really enjoyed. Zoro’s bar fight in episode 1, Luffy tearing down Arlong Park, the thriller (?) type sequence in Syrup Village. They were really intense. 

My biggest qualm is the emotional beats. I really enjoyed Emily’s portrayal of the “help me” scene, but it still didn’t have the same effect as it did in the manga. Same with Sanji’s goodbye to Zeff. 

Overall, solid 8.5/10 and I think it’s a great intro to One Piece for people who aren’t really into anime. It functions as a gateway, a standalone, and something for old fans to see different concepts.",1693526559.0

"verizon","t5_2raz5","I have the exact same issue going on and I have never been a Verizon customer. Bought the phone on Feb 2022 from Apple Store in Apple Park ( with Applecare+) and have been using Google Fi for more than 2+ years. All of a sudden, one morning I phone lost signal and only SOS. Tried installing reinstalling phone factory reset everything you can think of. Reached out to Apple for an express replacement since I had AppleCare+ and was told that this phone is put on the blacklist by a carrier. When I asked who the carrier was, they said they couldn’t provide that information. Instead, they directed me to a third party CHECKMEND.COM to check with who has the database list and will be able to tell me more details regarding the carrier etc who blacklisted the phone. After a day or two got a email from check mend that it was reported, lost or stolen by Verizon (with whom I have never been a customer of/ had any service from) and that I would have to contact them. When I contacted the fraud department, they were not at all helpful. All that they mentioned was that Apple had to call them to make this request and confirmation that this phone is store-bought. When I reached out to Apple they escalated it to their engineering team and after about 3 days they come back and say we cannot do anything about it and that I would have to contact Verizon. After exhausting all my options and being super frustrated with the whole situation, I turn to this blog only to find out that there are many others dealing with this issue. Filed a complaint with Verizon Executive Relations last night and someone called me today and asked me send them the Apple phone receipt and assured me they would get back within three business days with a resolution.

It’s not our careers and homes, our possessions and social media. It’s not billionaires and celebrities, CEOs and corporations. These things are all made up by the ego. I know there’s a lot more depth to being the human {animal} we are, and the want and need to know more is what drives me everyday to keep going forward in life. I tired for a long time to be like everyone else around me and ignore the voice of nature, but I hear an owl at night or a falcon’s call while it soars above and to me it registers as a language that I recognize somewhere deep inside.

The nato catches back on an empty mag but doesn’t have an external bolt catch or external bolt release. So you have to insert an empty mag to lock the bolt back, or you have to pull the charging handle back and lock it upwards. 

To release the bolt on a nato you have to pull the charging handle rearward.

My partner and my childhood was so volatile and unpleasant, we don't have kids in part because of it. All we remember are these narcissistic, sadistic, overbearing miserable people smacking us around,not giving us any freedom or space.

"coworkerstories","t5_2y47p","All i can say is that I have a neighbor like this who came on to me so hard core when i first met  her about 6 years ago and she acted like she had some kind of sexual power over me and that she was just so incredibly desirable.

Over time, I would never reciprocate, encourage her to go to marriage counseling.

She continued to want to come over to my place and starts asking me about drugs or alcohol. 

Again, more attempted D teasing flirty sex talk & giving me a chance to “do her” but I never reciprocated. 

She’d half way tell me about how she never gets enough sex while over sharing about being molested or raped. The stories always changed or varied.  It made no sense… 

She said that her husband kept her on a tight leash, but he has no sex drive. She told me that he found out she was masturbating and he got mad and threw away all of her sex toys… then more stuff about her sexual abuse or traumas.

I literally kept telling her “please stop talking to me about that stuff. I don’t want your husband to get the wrong idea about us. You’re not going to actually have sex with me and cheat on your husband .”

And then, I didn’t want to hang out with her anymore, so I just bought her a bottle of vodka and left a Hidden for her near her car …

A couple of days later, her husband angrily texted me from her phone saying that I had been contributing to problems in their marriage and to please stop giving her alcohol ! 

I stopped all contact with her for the next couple of years. She’s recently tried “buttering me up.”

And they just had their third child …. She asked me if I want us to meet her new baby and I said sure. Then she comes over with him and says “we haven’t had sex for years except for this one time pointing to her son.”

Right back to ghosting and ignoring her, I go … I said hi to her and her husband the other day, but just stay the hell away from that crazy woman

She’s always been criticizing her husband and marriage. It’s unbelievable. Plus they have three kids between the two of them and he has other kids from his first marriage.   I’m just a single bachelor next door and don’t have time for all that crap.",1693526561.0

"Gamingcirclejerk","t5_2sf2b","PSA: Make it a habit of **reading the [rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingcirclejerk/about/rules)** of each subreddit you participate in:

**Rule 9: No Offensive Imagery**: *This includes nazi imagery and slurs, for you brave nerds who think ""free speech"" involves private internet forums. If you post fascist iconography trying to “jerk”, you will receive a ban. The only exception is when we make fun of gamers and criticize gamers who happen to be fascists. Please remember to spoiler any potentially triggering or offensive content accordingly. This rule now includes repeatedly posting bigotry from the same source (4chan).*

**Rule 7: No Participation in Linked Threads (Brigading)**: *If you are coming here to brigade this sub, you will be banned. Likewise, do not make comments and vote in pages you've found here. Of course, if you're a member of said sub and you were already in the thread before, this doesn't apply to you.*

**Rule 8: Censor Screenshots**: *Keep screenshots of arguments on Reddit to a minimum. Please remember to censor screenshots of all identifying information, i.e usernames* **and** *subreddit names. This applies to screenshots from any social media sites.*

**Rule 11: Keep Posts Relevant (only about Don Cheadle)**: *This is first and foremost a place to make fun of gamers. Just because someone is being a bigot online doesn't mean it belongs here. Let them be pathetic without infecting the sub with their nonsense. Please avoid posting screenshots that show people using capital G gamer slurs.* **If absolutely necessary, please censor posts and the words containing such content.**

**Rule 12: No Fake Posts on Other Subs (Contamination)**: *Do not create fake posts on other subs only to post back here. Also, do not ""lol, you should post this on r / OtherSub"". It's considered interfering with their content and can also lead to brigading.*

Not true. And who brought up Trump? He is not my cup of tea. I never mentioned anything. sounds like you are intellectually lazy and relying on tropes to base your argument.

Check out the Pfizer Data Drop. Very interesting stuff in there.

Why did they stack the test groups in Argentina with mostly women? By their own admission it was because traditionally women don't have the same heart issues men do. 

Why does the vaccine make you approx 6 times more likely to get covid than an unvaxxed person.

GOING BACK TO TRUMP. Why did the narrative change. Pelosi, Biden, Kamala ""HAHA""Harris all said they would never take a trump vaccine. And then Biden was elected and suddenly the messaging changed.

Remember when this all started? Chinatown and Pelosi! You don't need a mask, it's all perfectly safe. then bam, all masks all the time.

I  feel very badly for you. I hope you resolve your bitterness before it kills anything good about you.

"FirstTimeHomeBuyer","t5_379e9","When we started house hunting, my husband and I made a three part list: things we had to have (single family house, large back yard, west side of Los Angeles due to cooler temperatures, wood floors), deal breakers (homeowner association, busy street, near an airport, corner house, on an alley), and things we’d rather have, but could live without (pitched roof). We did this because I’d had too many friends fall in love with a house that was deeply flawed.

We bought a house that was owned by a hoarder. It took us eight months to make it habitable because it smelled awful. It was worth it. It’s a great house in a great neighborhood.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","I'd love to hear about a cheaper phone plan. Got any you would recommend? I dont have internet so my unlimited 5G phone data, with my phone's mobile hotspot capacity, is important for me for doing schoolwork. 

The gym is essential for my health, so I can't cancel that, though I will look for cheaper memberships that are close enough to home. 

~$30/month on subscriptions isn't gonna put me into more debt, and canceling them won't get me out of debt any time soon. Everyone needs entertainment and stress relief, and complete austerity isn't gonna be sustainable for me. 

I want to get rid of my debt of course. After getting my new degree, I could wipe out the reserve line debt with one pay check. I hate losing money to the interest fees, but I worry about wiping out my limited savings just to pay off this debt that, annoying as it is, is manageable. I'd rather prioritize paying off my Best Buy Card sooner, though it isn't really charging me too much interest, just to get it over with.

Most of my clothes I've had for years, I shop at thrift stores, I do minor sewing repairs, wear shoes out til there's holes in them, etc. I'm budgeting so much for clothes so that I can have money saved up when I *need* new shoes, or a new winter coat/gloves.",1693526562.0

They do what they want to do, it's not my place to force them to do anything if they don't want to.

Overall, I kind of look at how accomplished a vocalist is in three dimensions 1) how good their actual voice sounds 2) how hard is it to sing the parts in their songs 3) how dynamic they are between styles (Noah Sebastian of Bad Omens provides a master class this)

Basically you need all three to be a god tier vocalist.

I think Hayley is well known for the first one, but it’s more of an innate ability than a skill, so it’s hard for me to give her or anyone else a ton of credit for it. I think some Paramore songs show 2 more than others, and I think a lot of the older songs had much harder parts to sing. I always thought she struggled more with 3 more than a lot of other “elite” rock singers, but it’s not really a factor for the music they write so it’s hard to dock her for it. Basically, I like how the newer music shows off 1, but the older music shows off 2 and 3.",1693526563.0

The most important promotions mid-late game are: logistics(frigate) charge, air repair and blitz(paratrooper), the others are less important. Of those promotion:

Air repair is 3rd promotion, which anyone can have with brandenburg/autocracy. For zulu it means having air repair in all cities without going autocracy, so if arabia go autocracy the extra bonus zulu has is production/food/science from order/freedom. But because camel archers arabia will have more and better land than you so it cancel out.  
Logistics is 4th promotion, requires both brandenburg and autocracy for zulu. But the unit that needs it the most is frigate(only 2 range but has lots of movement) which came 1 era earlier than the time you can finish brandenburg and having ideology. For air units air repair is just too valueable so you can't just skip and go for logistics. Logistics subs is op but ai is so terrible at naval you can win way before that.

Blitz paratroopers are probably biggest bonus you have, but since they're only for capturing cities you don't need a lot of them",1693526563.0

"religion","t5_2qh39","Well the simplest answer is what religion is, is just the culmination of the creativity of humans and telling stories. Religion has been a way for humanity to control large populations and bring people under a universal set of rules. The flaws you’re seeing is the adherent flaws of humans themselves. I personally, and due to my personal experiences of being slighted by members of certain ones, can’t ever see past the atrocities that have been committed in the name of God. 

But at the same time, when I see a person I believe to be good and true, try to better their life with religion. It makes me happy for them. Because I will never disagree with humans trying to be better for themselves, for their family, for their community.
 
I’ve tried reading the Bible multiple times and have actually read a decent amount. While I’ve read some things and saw the truth through my own experiences. I’ve read a lot that were completely wrong and just a manipulation tactic to get people to behave or act a certain way. Which deep down I know that’s not “holy” or “divine.” That’s humans being humans. 
I’ve also read things where it just didn’t make sense. Which I assume is just me being too dumb. 

At the end of the day, I’ve given religion a chance many times. The only story that ever made any sense to me was siddhartha. Which he was able to find enlightenment from being a ferryman on a river.",1693526563.0

If the ADC just flames and doesn't help by any means then, just move on, go to other lane, and if you see others going to bot to clean the wave go with him/her to gain exp, even the ADC goes 0/10/0 it doesn't get much gold to the enemy so focus to the objectives, ward, and alert the others to prevent gank, if you lost the game... well shit happens, is not something that you can control other's player's hands/mindset.",1693526564.0

If you have open, non-judgmental communication with them on this and other subjects, they are going to be more likely to share with you what is going on with them, and what they are feeling.

If your child is trans, it would be harmful forcing them into a gender role that simply isn't them.  The same is true if they are not!  And it seems like your wife is trying to push your son in a direction.  The fact that she is a psychologist really suggests she should know better!

But, her being a psychologist is probably a step towards a solution.  Engage a third party that specializes in such things, and get an appointment.  I rather suspect they are unlikely to give a definitive answer, but rather relay an impression, and the potential suggestion of continued work (if he is transgender, this is what should happen... not simply giving girly gifts; girly gifts are appropriate if that is what is asked for!

"MangaCollectors","t5_3p7rg","Alright here we go:

- **Aria**: Aria is one of the most 'pure' slice of life out there, there's no plot to follow, no story structure, etc. Every chapter is a wondrous joy and adventure throughout Neo-Venezia (imitation of Venice), or about doing random things like visiting a local coffee shop. It's about enjoying the small things in life like a beautiful sunset or a nice walk. But the characters do still progress and get development here. It just makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside, like a cozy blanket. Oh yeah, the backdrops and art are pretty gorgeous too.

- **A Bride's Story** - If you want some of the most detailed art out there, rivaling Berserk, this is it. http://goodokbad.com/index.php/reviews/brides_story_review 

Not my review, but this long review will do any better than I can. It's a fantastic historical slice of life into a unique culture.

- **Laid Back Camp** : Comfy, cozy and educational. The characters are great fun and the art is really different for a slice of life like this, but it's great. The manga really teaches you about camping and things like that. Pretty simple but it's a specific vibe that can't be matched.

- **Hakumei and Mikochi**: Have you ever imagined it that you’re so small just like an ant when you’re in your childhood or even now? Well, this series has brought for you.
Follow Hakumei and Mikochi, two girls who their body so small that live in forest below a big tree.
It’s a warm story that tell the daily lives of these two girls, despite being so small, they can do a hard labor work like make a construction or even repaired it. They can even ride a small creature like insect to travel or help them to carry a heavy stuff, makes a relationship with others small being like them or another animals and solved a problems that coming caused their small bodies. You can know how the world looks like from an inchling's point of view.


- **Girls Last Tour**: Oh I don't even know where to start with this one, the art is very unique and sketchy yet.. not. It's very dinstinctive. It's a post-apocalyptic world with characters Chito and Yuuri, one serious, one happy go lucky. As they hopelessly search for a sign of civilization in these barren lands, they may undergo humanity's last tour. This is a masterfully crafted trek into a dying world, contemplating the reason for living and dying. Deceptively simply yet intuitively deep.

- **Barakamon** : Barakamon was a manga that was recommended when I was looking for stuff similar to Yotsuba&, and is likely the manga I've most enjoyed reading so far. It follows the MC who is working towards becoming a calligrapher, following in the footsteps of his famous father. After a failed show, Handa Seishu moves to a remote island to attempt to seclude himself in his studies. There, Handa begins to open up to the community around him, and his experiences bleed into his work, bringing more life and flavor to his work as a calligrapher.  Story and cast are both fantastic, it does a great job of staying funny while instilling the lessons it wants to teach both the characters and the readers, and has a lovely light-hearted tone throughout the entire manga.



**Yotsuba**: This manga can only be understood if read. Cozy, comforting and the cast is just pure excellence. They play off eachother really well, and Kiyohiko Azuma's comedic timing is almost unmatched. The art is understated yet perfect for the manga. Truly a must read for any manga conoisseur.


**Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou**: I could make my own review, but I wouldn't do it justice. https://myanimelist.net/reviews.php?id=48177 Here's a long one. In put, a cult classic SoL manga that SoL diehards would consider the best. The art is in a class of it's own. Very amazing style.",1693526565.0

Sincerely, thanks for acknowledging I'm right to some extent.

YES, I can see the horrible distortions on the part of our mutual adversaries.  And the horrid false equivocation.  

I believe you cannot fight fire with fire; ergo we cannot fight obfuscation with obfuscation...  Gonna make a leap here: X, nee-Twitter (eyeroll) is NOT the ""town square"", NOT because it's privately owned, but because it's limited to 288 characters.  [I also acknowledge counter arguments have merit]...

... my wife's bachelors is in advertising, so we have this debate all the time...  the significance of THE MESSAGE vs. the value in transmitting that message in a manner that's digestible to *enough* of *the right* people...   

I do see it, but there's a reason ""consent"" is LEGALLY distinct from ""informed consent"".  And i'm gonna level with you -- I've had a rough week and am not sober as I type this...

What I assert is we NEED a ~~discussion about~~ new ""social-media"" framing of .... what level of => precision vs. accuracy :: subjectivity vs. objectivity :: how that impacts morality :: how that impacts practicality.... That we can ALL (okay 80/20 rule fine) USE in REAL TIME to communicate adequately.

"bayarea","t5_2qjyy","I have lived here for 20+ years, parked in SF, Alameda, Richmond, Fremont, Millbrae, Hayward, Pleasanton, Livermore.  Break-in never, but my roommate back in college got his window smashed b/c his dumbass left his MacBook in the back.

What does my experience and your experience indicate anything?  Nothing.  My parents lived in the Bay even longer and they never had their car stolen, granted they live in rich area.

Your car getting smashed or stolen could be due to a multitude of factors and if your only default reasoning is b/c it’s the Bay, maybe you should move out of the bay for your own safety.

There are criminals in the Bay, is it that much worse, same or better than similar metropolitan? I don’t know but I don’t mind reading data on it.  Oh before you bring in prop 47, many other states even those considered more conservative such as Texas have similar laws with even higher threshold than CA.  The law was also passed back in 2012/2014?  It’s not a new law at all.

Like it is a CHALLENGE to get my boyfriend to climax (classic antidepressant moment) but giving up on head after only 5 minutes? I spend like 40 minutes to an hour and a half giving him head.

Mixing hands into it is a must, usually I'm hitting one of the main ""pleasure buttons"" but ymmv with those. 

 Maybe reassure them that they don't have to be delicate, and should be putting pressure on with their tongue?

I’ve had a few abdominal surgeries and so with that, could something prevent them from placing one? like too much scar tissue? 

I’ve also have a history of two blood infections (line related) one being MSSA & the recent one, MRSA. are my chances of getting an infection higher? 

they said it’s an outpatient surgery, but i’m scared they’ll admit me due to the past. my 21st bday is thursday and i really don’t wanna be in the hospital. were you admitted or was it an outpatient thing? 

how was the recovery? was it painful? 

how quickly did you fell a difference after it was placed? how are you doing now? 

i’ll probably have more questions before & after the surgery",1693526568.0

Go try to buy a MI100 or 200 card even today and those have bern out for a few years now. This will be the largest production run of this kind of card AMD has every done. We know by looking at the CoWoS estimate allocations from TSMC relative to Nvidia projections. Can't know exactly the numbers, but it's more than safe to say this is going to huge. As far as the hype or interest drying up before AMD can get to matket..I'm not worried at all. This is the first round of many of building hardware accelerators to AI LLM workloads.  As those workloads  evolve and we have more prevailingly used models, those will benefit from more specialized acceleration rather than these more generalized ones. Right now it's big GPU with lots of VRam to train, but soon the big players will want chips that are highly optimized to that one specific workloads. It's gonna be the same sort of life cycling as we've always seen in DC. This is just a hudge boot stap going on now to get this kicked off. Hold on, you'll be glad before too long.",1693526569.0

A lot of this doesn’t come down to the games we play, it comes down to the “oh it’s bethesda so it’s fine” I swear if other devs did this kind of shit, people would tear them apart but because bethesda is known for jank and loading screens it’s ok ? If the engine is not capable of handling 1000 planets and no loading screens then don’t give us 1000 planets.

"CPTSD","t5_2vvid","this is why i think it's really dangerous to look too much into disorders before getting tested because you can subconsciously sabotage your own diagnosis and be diagnosed with something you don't even have and struggle with treatment since it's for the wrong diagnosis. id personally recommend not looking too deep into it and try to be as honest as you can with yourself. if you're answering something and you get an impulse that feels like you need to make the answer more extreme out of a ""oh no i might not get the diagnosis"" thought, try to take your time again with the answer. i've been there and it's such a big issue when trying to get a proper diagnosis, you don't want to minimize your issues but you also don't want to exaggerate out of fear. ask the purpose behind a question if necessary. that's how i tried to do it. being brutally honest with yourself and taking time to really listen to yourself can help a lot. i hope this helps and regardless of any of this, just get tested. keep going forward, i went through multiple diagnoses until i finally figured it out. it is a lot of trial and error unfortunately.",1693526570.0

[Here's a list of symptoms associated with depression](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/detecting-depression#1), so you can double check.



Here are a number of things you can do yourself, to improve your depression symptoms:

Often there is a hidden cause for your depression, you might not like yourself or your life. The below advice addresses the symptoms and will reduce them, but you still need to fix the cause.
That's the whole point of therapy. With professional guidance, figuring out the causes and then addressing them one by one. If you want to skip that step, you'll have to compensate for it somehow. You should review your life and see if there are any obvious causes for your sadness and find ways to remove them or make them more bearable.

Some people don't know why they are depressed. A common reason is a lack of purpose. To live is to suffer, but it is possible to make that suffering bearable, if you do so while trying to achieve what you want more than anything else. **Let me know if you need help to find your purpose in life.**

For the below advice, take your phone and set repeating alarm clock reminders, with labels of what to do. Train yourself to either snooze or reschedule the reminders if you can't take action right away, but never to ignore them. The intention is [to condition yourself](https://www.cleverism.com/classical-conditioning), to build habits, so you will start healing yourself without having to think about it.

* **Sleep**: [There is a complex relationship](https://www.webmd.com/depression/guide/depression-sleep-disorder#1) between [sleep and depression](https://www.healthline.com/health/healthy-sleep/depression-and-sleep). 
When you have days where you don't have to do anything, set an alarm clock. You really don't need more than 7 hours at most per night (a [little more](https://health.onehowto.com/article/how-many-hours-of-sleep-are-needed-per-night-by-age-8233.html) if you are under 18). If you can't fall sleep, try taking melatonin one hour before going to bed. It's [cheap](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003JJ9TQA), OTC and [is scientifically proven](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-940/melatonin) to help regulate your sleep pattern. [Also, rule](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/news/20120330/sleep-apnea-linked-depression) out [sleep apnea](https://www.healthcentral.com/article/sleep-apnea-treatment-resistant-depression). Up to 6% of people have this, [but not everyone knows](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-apnea/features/sleep-apnea-clues). If you find yourself awake at night, start counting. Don't grab your phone, don't do anything interesting. We're trying to *bore* you to sleep, not keep you entertained - sometimes it might *feel* like you've done it for hours and hours, but often it's really not long. Anytime your mind wanders away from the numbers, start over at 1. count at the speed of either your heartbeat or your breathing. Then both Alexa and Google Home can also play a range of sleep sounds if you ask them (rain or other white noise) and there are also free apps for both Android and Apple devices.

* **Go outside**: If you haven't been outside much lately, [you might just need some sunlight](https://www.healthline.com/health/depression/benefits-sunlight). 
15 minutes two to three times a week is enough. This will fix serotonin levels as well as vitamin D deficiencies.

* **Meditate**: [Depressions can be significantly reduced by meditating](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/04/harvard-researchers-study-how-mindfulness-may-change-the-brain-in-depressed-patients/). The best types Of [Meditations For Depression Relief](https://www.thedailymeditation.com/meditation-depression). 
Your attention is like a muscle. The more you train it, the better the control you have over it. [Mindfulness training](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/) will help you gain better control over your mind. It doesn't take much effort, just 15 to 20 minutes a day of doing nothing but focus your attention is enough and is scientifically proven to work. As you become better at focusing your attention, it will become easier to force yourself to stop having negative thoughts, which will break the negative reinforcement cycle. Go here for more: r/Meditation

* **Exercise**: [The effect of exercise on depressions](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/depression/in-depth/depression-and-exercise/art-20046495/) 
If you have access to a gym, then start lifting weights. If you don't have access to a gym (or you don't like lifting), start running. If you can't run, then start walking. Just start small. 10 minutes three times a week is fine. You don't have to run fast, just run and then slowly build it up over time. Exercising does several things: It releases endorphins, it takes your mind of your negative thoughts and it will improve your overall health.

* **Give lots of hugs**: [Hugs release oxytocin](https://health.usnews.com/health-news/health-wellness/articles/2016-02-03/the-health-benefits-of-hugging), which improves your mood and relaxes you. So find people to hug. If you are single, hug your parents or friends. If you can't, see if a dog is an option. Most dogs love to hug. Another solution that provides the same benefit is a [weighted blanket](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=weighted+blanket) will provide a [similar positive effect at night](https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/do-weighted-blankets-work). [You should try to aim for 12 hugs a day](https://psychology-spot.com/brain-needs) (if you currently don't hug a lot, I suggest you slowly build it up over time).

* **Music**: [The right music can improve your mood](https://time.com/5254381/listening-to-music-health-benefits). The genre is not important as long as it is: *""Upbeat, rhytmic and energetic""*. What this means differs from person to person, depending on their music taste. I have a special playlist for this. One way to measure the effectiveness, of the songs is your ability to listen to it over and over (if you can listen to it hundreds of times it likely has the highest positive effect on your mood). The effect can be amplified by using headphones and playing it LOUD and can further be enhanced by closing your eyes (doi:10.1177/0305735617734627, doi:10.1093/jmt/50.3.198 and doi:10.1177/0305735617751050).
* **You are not your depression**: For some people (often those that have been depressed for a long time), their depression has become a part of who they are and they assume a victim role. But that is a big problem, you have to *will* yourself into someone that sees themselves as a person that is actively fighting their disease, that *no longer identifies* with it, or else you will *unconsciously obstruct your own healing process*. As Eckhart Tolle expressed it in A New Earth:
* > *A very common role is the one of victim, and the form of attention it seeks is sympathy or pity or others' interest in my problems, ""me and my story."" Seeing oneself as a victim is an element in many egoic patterns, such as complaining, being offended, outraged, and so on. Of course, once I am identified with a story in which I assigned myself the role of victim, I don't want it to end, and so, as every therapist knows, the ego does not want an end to its ""problems"" because they are part of its identity.*

If you are not sure if you really have self esteem issues, then [here's a page of 10 warning signs that you have low self esteem](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/10-warning-signs-that-you-have-low-self-confidence.html). Read it and you can confirm yourself if the below advice applies to you or not.


[What is self esteem?](https://www.lifehack.org/688465/how-to-build-self-esteem)

self-esteem is the overall sense or feeling you have about your own self-worth or self-value.

Causes of Low Self-Esteem:

* An Unhappy Childhood
* Traumatic Experiences
* Experiences of Failure
* Negative Self-Talk

Here is a short overview of how to improve your self esteem:

1. **Identify and challenge your negative beliefs**.
 * Notice when you are thinking negative things about yourself. And ask yourself, is it really that bad? More than likely you are exaggerating the issue, which just pulls yourself down.
 * Get in the habit of stopping yourself when all you do is think negatively about yourself.

In the context of the film, he was extremely important. The US government sent the Marines to get him and flew him halfway around the world non-stop to just fix the drill bit they had planned to use. He's the industry consensus best deep core driller on the planet and since the plan is to do deep core drilling I would think his opinion would be worth a little something. 

Second, they didn't have to reverse engineer anything. They had the plans and *still put it together wrong*. You're attached the theory 'they're smart so they must know' to this and you're wrong. A guy who works on a backhoe for years can make it do things the engineer who built can't make it do. And people design stuff all the time that it takes years for other people to reverse engineer, why is there the assumption that drilling is not specialized knowledge? Could the engineers have figured it out eventually? Maybe. But they were working within a very tight window, less than 18 days, so why not ask the man who designed it.

Force him? Really? When he was willing to risk his life to go up and do the job himself? Your argument makes no sense. They had a crew of ""fit and ready"" astronauts who had been training for eight months - eight whole months - and Harry had a group of drillers who he'd worked with for years. And you'd go with the relative rookies over the pros? That's like starting a college QB over Aaron Rodgers to win the Superbowl. 

Then there is is the landing and the drill to depth card is why they NEEDED Harry's crew, and Harry, because the world would have ended without him.

The astronauts landed the ship on wrong spot, on an iron plate. Not Harry's crew, the astronauts. They're not infallible.  And that's something with the limited training the astronaut drillers would not have been equipped to handle. Even Harry's team with years of experience had issues.  

Then at the two hour mark per that card that the astronaut took out of the safe, Harry and his crew were two hundred feet behind at the appointed time. The order was then to drop the nuke on the surface and evac. This would NOT have achieved the goal. But the astronaut was ready to do exactly this, and even pulled a gun (a gun in space?) to enforce this command. Harry had to fight him to get him to let him finish. Would the fit and ready astronauts just followed orders and killed us all? 

And the line ""you got a weight limit on the shuttle?"" is from the movie. It's supposed to be a bit of levity. You haven't seen it in a while, have you?",1693526571.0

If they carried on swearing the things would continue to be withheld under threat of them being withheld longer if they don't change their behaviour. Kid wants their stuff back/doesn't want to be bored so they do it. Hopefully with a follow up conversation about the reasons being rude and disrespectful like that is wrong.

But it hugely depends on the parents and the reason the child is swearing. It's all very well saying ""if that was my child..."" but it's not, a child who has been taught why it's wrong to be disrespectful and set a good example can be more reasonably expected not to swear at their parents than a child who hasn't been taught that and hasn't had a good example set. If the reason a child is shouting and swearing is that's what they see their parents doing the issue isn't that the child needs discipline it's that the parents need to behave better.",1693526571.0

You CAN though buy say a $100 ship with store credit, and then a sale price warbond upgrade for $5 to upgrade that ship to one with say a $130 value.

And of course you can't apply an LTI token to a cheaper ship.  That's the entire premise of an LTI token, it's the cheapest, or close to it, ship that can be bought with LTI.

"PowerScaling","t5_yrt2z","My thought process was that unlike Jotaro, who when mad lands savagely powerful hits was still kind of innacurate and left DIO with most of his brain left despite the barrage, Diavolo is extremely precise with his attacks and aims for one-shots and can seemingly pierce through bodies and stands with no effort (like how he was seemingly able to pierce through both Giorno and GER in the Future that never came to fruition)

Diavolo's precise strikes combined with Time Skip and Epitaph giving him perfect setup to run his hand through either DIO's or the World's Skull (along with A in speed)

But there's definitely a great argument for why he straight up can't, SP is still definitely alot stronger and it required a super pissed joot to end DIO (although it was with a really simple punch to the leg that split him in half lol), and King Crimson is also seemingly extremely fragile (E persistance), so it seems just as likely that he'd break his fist on DIO's skull lol",1693526572.0

It's ok to be obese because = trauma? She's accepted herself for ""who she is"", (admittedly by your own post not a natural state for her), where she's over indulging in food as a coping mechanism. 

How is that ok? How is that different from an anorexic starving themselves to death because of trauma? How is it different from a drug addict slowly killing themselves?

How about instead of accepting, affirming, glorifying, and enabling these people, instead of lying and telling them they're healthy, we actually admit these people need help and are obviously not at all ok.

Obesity isn't healthy for any reason. Your friend is physically showing how bad her mental health is and it's supposed to be a ok and healthy? That her self induced state is an example of fighting beauty standards?

LeBron is 39. He was gassed against Denver. He took ISO threes while shooting horribly from three. A few of those possessions were costly and could have put the Lakers ahead of Denver. Reaves, meanwhile, had proven late into the season (when LeBron was hurt) and in the playoffs that he can create plays. 

In case you haven't noticed, Reaves is 25. This isn't some young rookie who needs lessons on how to play the game. It's a mature, grown adult who has a high BBIQ and can make a difference. He doesn't 'need' picks but yes, guards today generally will use picks. Have you watched FIBA like at all? Reaves has been able to generate offense without picks.",1693526574.0

In particular the first comment, with more upvotes than any other by user Guilty_Inflation_452

look at that post history and tell me it is organic.  All is does is post on liners on pro-nuclear stories and uranium stock articles.  A pump and dump bot.

So the same bots being used by a hedge fund astroturfing these stories, is also running a pump and dump.  Dear SEC...

Lets look more at replanet's activity on this website

Posted here: https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/12o9b4x/environmentalists_in_berlin_protest_against_the/  again presenting as an environmental group vs a corporate lobby group (where did the picture come from? not an organic account, it was posted by someone associated with the event because that sub bans non original content).  The account posting it was suspended which reddit does for things like spamming and violating sitewide rules.

https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/uw6hnm/switch_on_nuclear_switch_off_putin/

here again, another suspended user posting original photos of the replanet publicity stunts.  So more astroturfing.

Again, another suspended user promoting replanet PR material
https://np.reddit.com/r/EuropeanFederalists/comments/uy8k4w/mark_lynas_of_replanet_outlines_how_europe_can/

Which happens to be material by a disgraced faux-environmentalist, mark lynas.

>But at an Oxford farming conference in 2013, Lynas jettisoned himself from fairly obscure environment writer into international prominence when he began his talk with a confession. “I want to apologize for having spent years ripping up GM crops,” Lynas said. “I’m also sorry that I helped start the anti-GM movement back in the 90s.” With head bowed, Lynas then revealed why he had been forced to take the stage and publicly atone for past errors. “Well, the answer is fairly simple, I discovered science. And in the process—I hope—I’m becoming a better environmentalist.”

>But Wilsdon and other British GMO policy experts noted a much larger problem: not only was Lynas’ speech not new, it wasn’t even true. “His claim that he was one of the leaders that launched this movement isn’t true,” said Sue Mayer, who worked for Greenpeace on GMO policy during the 90s. “He may have gone on a few demonstrations, but nobody around at the time remembers him.”

>“He issued this very dramatic, but essentially, fabricated reinvention of his own biography to springboard into a new phase of his career,” Wilsdon said of Lynas. “He isn’t an expert in any of this.”

"Sims4","t5_2x5o7"," I'm Jordon Landgraab. The son of Nancy and Geffory. They passed away. I was sad, until I saw her. I fell head over heels with our resident global superstar Suzanne. I didn't think she would even look my way. She saw me, and said hi.

We connected right away. Right as I was going to propose to her, I found out she was pregnant with my good friends baby, who happens to be a vampire. He wants her, but not the child. 

I love her so much that I decide to marry her anyhow. I think my vampire friend put a spell on me or mesmerized me into allowing him into our lives. Now he wants me to be ok with them still seeing each other? To top it all off, my brother was flirting with her also. What am I going to do? I don't want to loose her, but can I accept.... Fudge my brother of all people? 

Here comes my friend. What? Yes, everything is going to be all right... we are in an open relationship... yes I understand... everything is just fine...zzzzz

Suzanne here, well I was just trying to get to know others. Hit it off with a lot of people. Being a global superstar, it's going to happen. People will fall in love with you just because. Jorden and I were meant to be. Everything was off the charts with him. His friend Alexander and I had a small connection. I'm not sure what happened. It was all completely unplanned. He visited me one day, and we ended up, you know. Shortly later, I told him I was pregnant. Well, he took it extremely hard. How did I let him ... how did I end up in this situation...  Did he... Yes Alexander, I understand, you want Jorden and I to raise your child for you... you will be back for me... you will be back to train the child's vampire abilities when she is older... everything is going to be all right... zzzzzz

Foot note: I was in control of Suzanne by herself. Alexander poped in, and I was just letting them have a conversation on their own with no direction. Next thing I know they were headed to the bed, under the covers, with the covers flying around. It caught me off guard. I decided to go with the flow.

I have some crazy stuff happen, and made stories around the crazy. I think I'm going to journal them from now on. I can not remember everything. 

I hope you enjoyed Jorden's and Suzanne's story. It was between them, the serial killer who is is love with grimmie as she likes to call the grim reaper, and Lisa who is over excited because a global superstar asked her out from the clear blue. I was super suprised by that myself.

Is it better not to use drugs? Yes.  Recovering addict and alcoholic.  Sobriety was no big deal. Drugs almost killed me.

Drugs could cause anxiety and other things after 1 episode.

Drug recovery was brutal for me.  Weed suppresses memories in the past..  as you continue, these things intensify.  Also if you use to treat depression , anxiety and othe things, in recovery you have to deal with them straight up.

Quitting drugs was easy for me.  I tried to kill myself three times the week before hospital.  Experienced a complete loss of awareness (lost my mind). Lost a lot of memories too.  Took 3.5 years of intense effort to stop trying.

The worst part of recovery for me? I was on my own.  I literally had nothing except one month rent.  Turned down disability.  Isolated family and friends. Literally was fighting for my life   Even my Drs gave up on me.  They were amazed I lived.  Gave up trying med changes.

I was the only employee in the front of house for the first hour. I had like 7 open tables and one was a guy by himself. Non distinguishable white male. Jeans and a blank white t-shirt.
. I was pretty busy and in the zone. The man ordered a glass of water and a short stack of buttermilk pancakes.. no syrup or butter. Add a side of salsa. I should have noticed that when he said it, but another table was trying to get my attention. I wrote the order down and moved on. Then when the order came up I saw it and froze. Did I ring it up wrong? Checked my notes, nope. Ok so I made sure all my other tables were OK, then undivided attention I go and drop off the order. 
""One short stack and a side of salsa.""
>no response, he grabs the  salsa and starts spreading it on to the bottom pancake as though it was a cake and he was spreading icing. He does the same on the top pancake. 
 At this point I am no longer aware of the rest of the room. I'm just standing next to the table staring. He suddenly looks up at me and says ""Is this normal?"" 
I said ""No."" And walked away. Next time I came out of the kitchen maybe 4 or 5 minutes later the plate was clean and he was gone.  I have covered a lot of tables, people on acid, drunks, angry combative weirdos, guys trying to harass my coworkers.. pretty much you name it I've seen it. However the way that he switched from pastry chef deep in his craft(like he had seen all the cake shows to broken 4th wall ""Is this Normal?"" Was deeply disturbing.",1693526575.0
"skulduggerypleasant","t5_2sz2k","As much as *we* love it, I highly doubt it’ll “blow up everywhere.” It’s a very niche series, so you’re already at a back footer. Also, when I think of recent adaptations, they’ve typically been unsuccessful, just look at Uncharted. I know that’s a game not a book but I’d argue the popularity is relatively similar, if not larger. 

Either it would have to be a small budget animation, which risks doing the series an injustice, or it would have to gamble being a huge, high budget thing with A-list actors to bring in a new audience beyond the book readers… but if that doesn’t work (as adaptations often don’t unfortunately), that’s just a waste of money",1693526575.0

You’re right, playing games or with toys that are not classically stereotyped to your gender means absolutely nothing besides that maybe those toys shouldn’t be gender-assigned or that you’re learning to do things other people enjoy even if it’s not your first choice, which is an amazing life skill.

The only thing you can do is communicate and let him know how you feel. If he cares he will back off this woman. I've been in a similar situation before and it's tough. 
It is possible that he's falling for her and doesn't know it completely yet. 

As for her beauty. Everyone is beautiful in different ways. If she beats you in one way you'll beat her in another if that makes sense. Beauty is such a tough thing to deal with in the world as many people see beauty differently.
I'm sure you are gorgeous.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","(part 2) 

* 2. **Identify the positive things about yourself**.
 * Thinking positively about yourself is a big part of improving your self esteem. Occasionally just pause and think about all the positive attributes you have. you could also set a repeating alarm on your phone and do this once a week for a few minutes.
3. **Build positive relationships and avoid negative ones**.
 * If someone makes you feel bad, it might be time to leave them behind or avoid being around them.
4. **Don't be too hard on yourself**.
 * Life's really hard. For you, for me, for everyone. You shouldn't totally let yourself off the hook, but you can't be constantly trashing yourself either. It needs to be balanced.
5. **Learn to stand up for yourself**.
 * You have to increase your assertiveness. If that is a problem you deal with, let me know and I will give you separate advice for that.
6. **Challenge yourself**.
 * If you always avoid testing yourself and proofing that you can do complicated things, you'll just end up with a self esteem that's worse and worse. Pick the right challenge. It's alright if it's hard, but it shouldn't be impossible.
7. **See yourself how others see you**
 * Take a moment to think how other people view you. What do they notice? What do they love about you? What do they see in you?
7. **Do your best**
 * To really improve your self esteem, you're going to have to *try*. And that can be hard, especially if you're dealing with other issues (so don't forget, don't be too hard on yourself - but still *put in the effort*). You're going to need to convince *yourself*, that you're really not all that bad. And you can't do that, unless you try. And I mean really try.
 * Finding a meaning in life can help (and I can give you advice for that, if you currently lack a goal in life).
 * Motivational techiques and goals can help (and I can give you advice for that as well).

"martialarts","t5_2qkt4","It depends on what exactly you mean by a ""style like Lee's.""

Jeet Kun Do already exists and was made by the guy if you literally mean copying and following his style. Stylistically it focuses on speed and explosive power using the whole body. Primarily a striking art. There are a lot of practicioners around, though you may have to put some effort into finding a full school for it.

MMA has already done a lot of the work of distilling many arts into a fusion fit for competition. That said, MMA schools vary WILDLY in training philosophy. Some will train in traditional methods and others abandon their roots entirely and only focus on technique and modern training techniques. Entirely up to the consumer which method is preferred, as great fighters have come from both types of camps.

Lee's philosophy was basically ""the human body only moves in so many ways, so all martial styles are specific variations on that movement, so use what works for your body."" Lee was an incredible athlete and could perform physical feats well beyond most of the population, and the style he created used that and built off his earlier training in other styles into something uniquely his own. 

To do something similar, which is what I take your question to mean, you would need to study multiple arts and styles, find what works for your particular frame, body type, and mindset, and synthesize all of that into your own personal style, while also pursuing constant improvement in your strength, speed, endurance, and flexibility to make the most of your body. This is a life's work goal, as the arts constantly evolve and grow and you must do likewise. There is no such thing as a ""bad style"" if you can glean useful information and skills out of it. It is easy to mis-apply certain arts and try to force them to be something they are not, like trying to make Tai Chi into a combat sport like boxing. But even ""non-combative arts"" can teach you things you had not previously considered. Keep your vision in mind but be open minded to new ideas and dont be afraid to expand horizons",1693526577.0

A hash function is deterministic, so, same input = same output. When someone submits a username and password to your function, hash the incoming password with the same hash function as you used during the user registration phase, then use both the username and the *hashed* password in your database query. If no rows are found, they're not authenticated.

All of that said, this is great if you're learning about authentication. But I would discourage rolling your own auth solution if you're exposing this to the open internet.",1693526578.0

Length: 14 parts, about 18,600 words so far

Description: Ahsoka is mutilated by Vader on Malachor and nearly dies getting crushed by the rubble after the temple explodes; but she is found by a mysterious time traveler simply named The Veil and she gets ""rebuilt"". After an unintentional encounter with a douchebag weapons dealer she decides to stay with The Veil so she can help even more people, but he is hiding a dark secret. (It's basically starwars with a Dr Who parody thrown in) The adventures will flip between starwars time and stuff a little bit closer to ours. 

Snippet: ""What Ahsoka sees before her is completely impossible. Instead of a massive ship like she expected, it's just a metal box. No wider than 3 feet and no taller than 7, sitting hidden in the opening of an alleyway. She almost didn't believe it but she could see the cathedral-like console room through the open door. She sits there desperately trying to figure out how that is even possible as The Veil walks up and helps her stand.

The Veil: 'Oohhhh, right, did I forget to mention that my ship is bigger on the inside...by a lot.'

The Veil snaps his fingers and the door slams shut. He turns Ahsoka around and nudges her to walk forward, away from the impossible box.""

I’m 30f and I would never consider dating a 21 year old, because we are just at different places in life. Not judging anyone else or saying it’s impossible for a relationship like that to work, just wanted to share my perspective because when I was younger I didn’t see it the same way that I do now.

While Clerics and Druids combo well with Spirit Guardians and Spike Growth/Moon Beam, they're all focusing on Wis and aren't getting as much versatility as say a Warlock or Wizard partner. More of an out of combat concern.

Front liners in general are still great. Kiting is what you aim to do most with Astral Arms, so it doesn't hurt to have some bonafide melee.

I didn't. I responded to your first version of it. Then I went back and responded to your ninja edit of it. I went out of my way to answer the entire thing. I could have just ignored the extra paragraph you added. 

> get upset because it doesn't have the answer you were hoping for

You literally didn't answer the situation I was asking about.

> One of my black classmates said George deserved it because he should've followed the law and not sold ciggies on the street. If he would've just complied with the police then nothing would've happened. (Keep in mind his parents are scientists and spent 5-10 years beforehand galivanting around Europe and Nigeria with him)

So what? George Floyd was still a black man and now just one of so many examples. Because some rich black folks you know didn't sympathize with him doesn't change that. Do YOU think George Floyd was to blame? I think that's the real question here. 

Fact remains that if you, as a white man, can drive pretty much drive anywhere in this country and not worry about getting shot during a routine traffic stop. Plenty of people don't have that privilege. 

> So how is it supposed to work then?

I already told you. Sometimes privilege is just not having to worry about certain dangers. It's not an issue of having everything handed to you even if that can happen if you have money.

[Most third-party apps have shut down](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23779519/reddit-third-party-app-shut-down-apollo-sync-baconreader-api-protest) and so have many tools relied upon by moderators and [projects for making Reddit more accessible to visually impaired users](https://www.reddit.com/r/TranscribersOfReddit/comments/14ggf8k/the_future_of_transcribers_of_reddit/). 

Beyond the [disastrous AMA](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/09/reddit-ceo-doubles-down-on-attack-on-apollo-developer-in-drama-filled-ama/) by the CEO, Reddit's response has been limited to promises that this change will not affect moderation tools [^((it has)^)](https://www.reddit.com/r/BotDefense/comments/14riw76/botdefense_is_wrapping_up_operations/) and promises of [new and more-accessible first-party moderation tools](https://www.npr.org/2023/07/01/1184258201/reddit-api-accessibility-mods). Promises just like [ones they have made in response to past protests](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/142w159/askhistorians_and_uncertainty_surrounding_the/), but have consistently [failed to fulfill](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/14jm3ut/several_communities_have_surfaced_an_open_letter/jpm9e0q/). 

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

1. [Finding your favorite subreddits on other platforms](https://sub.rehab/) and participating there instead.  
2. Refraining from using the first-party Reddit app, instead sticking to one of the few remaining third-party apps or [patching one of the apps that shut down](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1wHvqQwCYdJrQg4BKlGIVDLksPN0KpOnJWniT6PbZSrI/) if you're using an Android device.  
3. Disabling ads on Reddit with [an ad-blocking extension](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#ublock-origin-ubo) or [a DNS-based ad-blocker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBXTnrD_Zs4).  
4. Cancelling your Reddit Premium subscription.  
5. Sharing the continued news coverage of these events.  
6. Encouraging others to do all the above.

>One thing, in all existence, is not tied to will. It is God. God is above and usually God's will is something we wouldn't normally do.

These are two very different gods.

>Is a human more than a tiger or a rooster.

As a human, I value humans more, were I a tiger, I would likely consider them a snack instead. It is all relative.

>I don't know why atheists argue so much if in the end they're just as lost as everyone else. 

Simple, we want to know. 

Argument is a good way to put forth ideas, have them challenged and see if they hold. By being forced to backup my assertions I have learned a great deal, just yesterday I looked into why Euthaphro would argue against the triomni God in 500BCE, turns out, he probably didn't. If I hadn't felt the need to backup my assertion that the Problem of Evil was designed to counter only a triomni god 2hen someone pointed out that the timeliness made no sense, I wouldn't have learned this.

rights to unionize. Unions have a long history of fighting for fair treatment, better wages, 

and improved working conditions for employees. They provide a powerful voice for workers and 

help ensure that their rights and interests are protected. In today's ever-changing global economy, 

unions are more important than ever as they provide a critical bulwark against exploitation and inequality. 

Join us in our mission to spread awareness and support for unions, and let's continue to fight for a just and 
 
equitable world for all workers!

"Supernatural","t5_2ql8e","Weren't keen on at first but grew fond of: Kevin, Linda and Charlie. Well hate is probably a strong word but in season 7 didn't love their characterization because they were too one note and stereotypical for my liking but from season 8 onwards I absolutely loved them and am forever angry about how their respective stories ended 

Liked and first and came to dislike: both the Winchesters but especially Dean. They get way too self centered and hypocritical for me and after Bobby dies there's absolutely nobody to call them out on it. Also the show has the tendency to either kill off likeable characters for the Winchesters manpain or once side characters (like Crowley or Cas) get stuck in the Winchester orbit, the show strips them of interesting parts of their character just so they can serve the Winchesters and it's so annoying. Dean in particular bothers me because all he is by the end of the show is a ball of anger and it's just not fun for me to watch",1693526582.0

Two big things, for me specifically on the Moclobemide, is I don't ruminate in any hopeless feelings, I remain optimistic, and it helps me not have social anxiety or feeling of awkwardness around people in social situations.  Going onto it and coming off of it has also been simple and easy for me in ways it was not with SSRIs.  For the most part I've only taken 150mg 2x/day, but have also used it on longer days as 150mg 3x/day.  Only briefly have I ever went up to 600mg/day in divided doses.  My time spent taking Moclobemide as part of my maintenance regimen have been the most successfully productive and optimistic.  I have also been experienced with Harmala alkaloids which are plant derived RIMAs.  (Reversible Inhibitors of Mono Amine Oxidase.)  Most recently I'm going on my 19th month straight of utilizing Moclobemide.  No interfering depressions, no diet restrictions, no apparent health problems, etc.  Also during this time I've been able to successfully kick a nasty cigarette smoking habit, which is great, and the Moclobemide was definitely part of helping me achieve that longer term than ever before in almost 30 years of mostly being addicted to smoking.  :)  I have thought about admitting my use of Moclobemide to my psychiatric nurse practitioner but I'm wary about making trouble for myself.  I am, afterall, the one who is getting the 1st-hand experience and results from whatever I use as medicine.  ;)",1693526582.0

It seems they grow in little spurts where they boom forward and then stall out. I repot and give fresh soil, after the roots heal for a couple weeks they boom again and then stall again after a couple months of growth.

Make sure the area is completely clean and dry before reattaching the anode cap, and make sure the prongs of the anode clip are properly seated in the hole. Might also be worth inspecting the anode clip for corrosion, given what you say about the monitor's previous storage conditions.

The dielectric grease is to keep dirt and moisture out from under the cap, so as long as there's a layer around the edge of the cap that should suffice.

The shruthi uses PWM for everything (Including the digital oscillator output) the Ambika uses a DAC for the oscillator and the VCA but PWM for everything else. 

If you Google Arduino DCO you'll find a few I think.
