"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;But from our understanding of the nature of the universe neither of these option seem at all possible.

I'm not sure why you say this.  They are both plausible, are they not?

\#1 would be a larger-scale version of the spontaneous creation of 'virtual' particles which is allowed for in current physics.

And what is wrong with #2?  As I understand it the Big Bang only means that no information about what might've come before could've survived - it doesn't mean there wasn't a cycle beforehand.

I gather that Stephen Hawking is proposing that time began with the Big Bang as well, so that would be a different theory which appears (to me, at least) to have the same problem (or a version thereof) as the one you're posing, but some (Hawking included) don't see a problem there.

&gt;does this not tell us that the way we perceive and understand the universe is under a great misapprehension?

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","&gt;In both cases, because they were not US Citizens.

The Jews were citizens of the Germany that sent them to the camps, first of all. Second of all, are you saying that it is acceptable for government to commit atrocities on people and give them no protections whatsoever, so long as those people are not citizens? You initially said that people could change their state of involuntary servitude or genocide victim by ""writing to their Senators,"" but then say that they are unable to do this if they are not citizens. In what society do you imagine slaves would be given voting rights? 

Your whole second segment here is quite terrifying. You seem to be saying that whatever the majority votes in as a law, you are willing to accept it (you might agitate against it, perhaps by protesting?) and would not consider it criminal or untenable by the government -- which has no concern about what you find ""morally repugnant."" Let me ask you then -- what if the law concerned you? What if you and your family were the victims of the law enslaving you or killing you? Would you simply send your children to the gas chambers, head held high in the knowledge that the majority of people voted for this so therefore they must have the right to do this? 

For the record, many foreign powers have issue with our stance on human rights. This is such a revealing comment by you because it implies, again, that you are extremely concerned with what the majority of others think -- in this case foreign powers -- rather than what you yourself believe to be right. Much of the Arab world, for example, is repulsed by the U.S. stance on a variety of issues, the Chinese, with well over a billion people, as well. Do you feel it's time to seek asylum in one of those areas? If not, why not? 

In your third section, you respond to my response by asking the same question I responded to. Why are human beings influenced by image? I don't know. I presume you feel that you and those people you respect are quite above being influenced by image and are better/more educated/more highly evolved than the rest of us peons who are mere ""sheeple."" Even if that were true, the fact is that -- apart from you and your higher-order of human friends -- human nature will not change because you want it to. Assuming that you can change the way people behave and think by making laws to create the effects you want only creates perverse incentives and unintended consequences, as I pointed out in my previous comment. You cannot change human nature. 

Your fourth section seems, again, to be reiterating points I thought we put to bed earlier in this discussion. Yes, I cannot have a country on my own. I do, however, have rights on my own. Those rights cannot properly be violated merely because a large number of people vote that they should. Saying we are all in this together is meaningless: if 10 men vote to rape a woman, can they simply say to her: ""hey, we're all in this together, it's a group decision!""? They do not have the right to violate her, regardless of how many of them vote to do so. Telling her that she can't ""opt out"" seems callous and not the kind of society that I would want to live in.

Your request that I cite examples of corporations that have gone out of business as a result of union pressures is irrelevant to my point, but I could point to the recent bankruptcy filing of American Airlines, in which they specifically cited union costs as a deciding factor, or the collapse of Pan American airlines, etc. Of course, unions are not generally the sole deciding factor in these bankruptcies, but they certainly help. All that said, it does not address my point to you: governments do not have the same tools to negotiate with unions as corporations do, and governments are not negotiating with their own money, so they lack the proper incentives. Do you disagree with those statements?

My solution to corrupt government ""enforcers"" of its own laws is to get rid of the government entirely from those areas. Government will always tend toward corruption, it has no reason not to. As Friedrich Hayek said: ""In government, the scum rises to the top.""

I don't know what the whole thing about the $2,500 is about, I'm sorry. I don't get the reference.

As for the elected officials and their relationships with union bosses -- I have no doubt these are valuable to both the politicians and the bosses. Remember that ""governments"" do not exist -- they are simply organizations of humans, like you and me, who will do what's in their own best interests. Usually that means paying off their friends with other people's money and not worrying too much about ""ethics."" Why should they? There's no consequence for doing the wrong thing unless you really screw up. I don't follow your point about whims, I'm sorry.

When people embezzle money from corporations that corporation goes out of business. When people embezzle money from the government, it simply takes more money from the people in taxes and continues right on going. Maybe the embezzlers get caught, but taxpayers are still left holding the bag. For example: in the bank bailouts, the government paid off bankers who effectively lied to everyone with money they took from you and me. You can blame the bankers, but they were just acting in their own interests, because the government guaranteed their bad loans, and paid them off exactly as it said it would. Who is at fault there more, the bankers, or the corrupt politicians who enabled them? 

If you'd like an instructive look at union corruption, watch Season 2 of The Wire. It's a great show, you won't be disappointed, and will be especially interested by the realism, I'm sure. Hell, watch the entire show, it's a case study in inept and corrupt governance.

Unions hurt non-workers the same way price controls hurt those things outside their control in general. Unions are simply a cartel for labor, identical to a cartel for any other good, like oil. They artificially limit the market for labor by forcing companies only to hire labor that they approve, much as OPEC artificially increases the price of oil by intentionally limiting the supply. If you are in the union, this is great: you get paid more per job. But there is no such thing as a free lunch. That extra money means people must pay more for the goods that the company produces (the company will simply pass on the union costs to its customers), and that it will be easily outcompeted by a company (say in Mexico, China or India) that does not have union fees to worry about (this is a major reason almost all manufacturing jobs have left to go overseas or at least to right-to-work states). But more importantly, the union laborers recover this fee by making it impossible for non-union workers to get a job. If these non-union workers were part of the viable workforce, the company could hire more workers for less money, thus reducing the cost of the good to its normal, market value, just as if OPEC released all the oil it produced. Unions do not improve conditions across the board, unless you consider being unemployed or forced to work a job that pays you less than you could earn were you allowed in the union to be an improvement.

Specifically, ""You see, that’s another point where I thought too much in what was true under prewar conditions, when all credit expansion, or nearly all, went into private investment, into a combination of industrial capital. Since then, so much of the credit expansion has gone to where government directed it that the misdirection may no longer be overinvestment in industrial capital, but may take any number of forms. You must really study it separately for each particular phase and situation. *The typical trade cycle no longer exists, I believe.* But you get very similar phenomena with all kinds of modifications.” (Nobel Prize-Winning Economist: Friedrich A. von Hayek, pp. 184–186).

"Games","t5_2qhwp","&gt;People who say gameplay over graphics are full of shit. 

I think it helps to define what it means to have ""good"" graphics.  I think a game can be immediately crippled by bad gameplay, whereas graphics are a bit more subjective unless you're talking about things such as draw distance (as you say).  For example, I would say without hesitation that Final Fantasy 6 is a better game than Final Fantasy 10, and that's not even putting the games into historical perspective.  And Braid?  It blows a game like Rage clear out of the water when we're talking about overall gaming experience.

But I think Braid and FF6 both have great graphics.  They're not technically impressive by any means (the latter might have been back when it was first released), but since when does that matter?  Art style and gameplay go hand in hand, whereas technological capabilities are sort of a different story.  

Red Dead Redemption probably wouldn't have been created had the technology not been in place to do so, so having the technology allows developers to do *new* things with gameplay.  However, it certainly doesn't necessarily allow them to do *better* things as we see time and time again, and there's still plenty to be explored from old technology as the indie developers out there continue to demonstrate.","1322697617"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Are these councils being elected? I doubt they're appointed by anyone. 

Why are the people of the town, who must have SOME idea of how much aid they are getting, allowing their funds to be mismanaged so horribly? I don't think the people running the town (possibly no one at all) know how to manage that much money. Many citizens have probably never left the town and don't have a clue what it's really like outside of their bubble. Has anyone taught them the skills to be able to run a town of 2800 people? 

Natives don't want the government all up in their shit most of the time so the government THROWS money at them. I think Native Affairs is one of the biggest budget items (clearly it's working..). Sure, we'll give you the money you need and we'll allow you to keep your culture and your schools and you can use the money yourself to make your town better. Then, when they completely, utterly fail in that and only after the situation has become horrific do they ask for help.

The truth is that so many reserves and native homelands are in the middle of nowhere. They have no chance of succeeding. I don't think it's right, for the people living in these places, to demand that the government spend an obscene amount of money improving a town that 1) only houses a couple hundred/thousand people, 2) is quite far from civilization, 3) has no business/business opportunities. You're choosing to continue living there. There have been billions of dollars given to the Natives over the years and clearly, the infrastructure of their communities doesn't seem to be improving. 

Maybe it's time to cut them off or give them a buy out. Here is XX dollars. This is it. This is enough to relocate, give you time to find a job, survive on for a bit.. whatever. Don't feel qualified for a job in your new town? Here. Pick something and go to school for it. But this is it. Yes, we stole your lands. (Well, not me or almost anyone I know. Most of us are the children of people who emigrated here LOOOOOOONG after the native lands were stolen and aren't related to the people who did it) Yes, we understand we gave you fire water and ruined your lives. We have also paid you back for it. Over and over and over again. And besides, if it wasn't 'us' it would've been someone else. Get over it. Grow up. ","1322697618"

The TLDR is that if a Cop is talking to you or wants to talk to you that means you are suspected or at least on the police radar. You would be better served not speaking to the police because anything you say to the police can be used against you but never help you in court.

The example he used was that if you tell the cops, ""Ya I didn't like the guy but I didn't kill him"" You just told the Cops that you didn't like the guy and the prosecutor can then put the cop on the stand and get him to prove that ""you didn't like the guy.""

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","&gt;Is the telling of or the laughing at jokes about stealing, cheating on your SO, drunken behavior, over-eating, racist behavior, etc. really seen as a ""covert nod of approval"" by thieves, cheaters, alcoholics, over-eaters and racists?

Actually, yeah. I'd say jokes about all of those things legitimize them, depending on the joke.

See, jokes are things where we don't sit down and discuss afterwards why they were funny. You tell the joke, I laugh, you get some reassurance that I approve. But often people are telling jokes to deflect an insecurity or to seek approval in a safe way. For example, I might joke to my coworker that when I go out of town, I'm totally going out and fucking some sluts. He knows I have a wife, and laughs. Maybe he thinks it's dark humor. But I get a little reassurance that hey, maybe this guy agrees that it's okay to go out and fuck sluts. Everyone does it.

It could go the other way - I think it's dark humor, but he cheats on his wife. My values of never cheating aren't clear. Do I like to fuck sluts, or am I monogamous?

That's the point the letter is making. A lot of people think it's totally fine to steal, cheat, get drunk constantly, over-eat, and be racist. Other people don't approve of any of those things. But we don't often sit down and chat about each other's norms. We communicate culture through jokes. Given that fact, you should be careful about what you're communicating when you make a joke or laugh at one.","1322697649"

"panthers","t5_2s1w0","There aren't any. I'm not sure you could possibly show something like that using statistics, so I don't know what he's claiming.  Obviously, if you look at statistics, the teams that took the players that were best *in hindsight* are going to have received better production from those players.  Besides, I'm not sure how anyone can possibly evaluate players relative to other positions *except* by looking at your team's need.  

Let's assume that there existed a statistic that *could* measure that.  It would have to show a) that the player was considered objectively better than a need player at that draft slot AT THE TIME OF THE DRAFT (if anyone could actually objectively determine this, the draft would move a hell of a lot faster), and b) that the player's added value is objectively higher than a player on a different team, at a different position, in a different system.  If there's actually a statistic that shows this, I'd love to know of it, because I could clean out some sports books in Vegas.

Edit:  Oh, and in answer to the original question:  I really like Claiborne. I think he potentially has that ""Have fun throwing to the other half of the field, because this territory belongs to me"" aspect that Deion, Champ Bailey, Raiders Asomugha and Revis had/have.","1322697652"

Paul and Huntsman share the same campaign issue: People don't understand their accomplishments..

What do people know about Paul? They know about what he would love to change. They know he votes ""no"" on a lot of things. 

But what are his accomplishments? He's spent no time telling people what bills he's sponsored, what he's gotten done. 

It's easy to fight against earmarks on principle, then vote for them anyway, when you're one guy in Congress. It's how the game's played. But as President, you have to get stuff done, and show you're not fighting for the perfect at the expense of the good.","1322697654"

I'm not sure where you hear that China has a middle class. It rates 56 in the [World wealth Index](http://www.prosperity.com/rankings.aspx)

2003 in just one province of the rustbelt, with three million people participating. Some 30 to 40 million workers who were dropped from work units 

Ching Kwan Lee study into Chinese labor

 “Chinese are plagued by a profound sense of insecurity,” arousing “rage and desperation” around the country. And she expects that there’s worse to come, as a looming crisis of landlessness in the countryside undermines the base for survival of the sunbelt workers.""

 &gt; they wrote the right to own private property into the constitution in 2004, and so 

They also have souring rhetoric about democracy and freedom in their constitution.  You simply can't own property in China. And you can't own it if you are not a citizen. 

 &gt;It is just as illegal to put melamine in milk in China as it is in America or Europe. Congratulations, you have identified an issue where government failed at its assigned task of regulation 

Next time you are in a third world country have a burger at a food stand  for me.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?

"austrian_economics","t5_2stjd","&gt;Once an insurance company has money to loose from damages cause by polution happening and money to gain from it not happening, there is an obvious incentive to prevent it.

Again, you're not being specific.  YOu have not answered the question and are simply answering in vague platitudes because you know you can't answer the question.

If I take out pollution insurance, what incentives would the insurance company give my neighbors so they don't pollute? 

&gt;Even if a business is only suspected of dumping and not proven, an insurance company could refuse to insure them. Without insurance they could lose their financing, because they would be a bigger risk.

This is false.  I can easily get life insurance without car insurance, and car insurance without homeowners insurance.  You're speaking in vague platitudes again because you know you have no specific examples to back it up.  Not even hypothetical examples. 

&gt;This is what worries me. It has no systemic incentive to succeed. Only the good hearts of the people in it.

This is why it will work: it's not motivated to make money.  If it were motivated to make money, it would have no incentive to solve global warming; it would simply lie about it, fund science to lie about it, and create fear to keep people funding it.  Once pollution is gone, it can't make money anymore, and goes out of business.

Without pollution, it has no product. 

&gt;Just stating that does not create incentives. Economists look for incentives, even if they are not monetary.

This is why countries with national healthcare have better healthcare than countries with private healthcare.  The incentive is that it betters society as a whole and saves the environment.  That's the incentive.  The incentive isn't money.  

&gt;The incentives of a global authority on pollution would be to perpetuate its own existence.

The organization is not primarily interested in staying in existence.  It's primary function is to reduce pollution.  

I have a few questions, and I appreciate your speedy responses.  This is a good discussion, despite my harshness.

1) What incentive does the pollution company have to reduce pollution?  Once pollution is gone, their business is gone; they won't be making any profits.

2) Did the national building code that the insurance companies create actually reduce the spread of fires at all?  I can see enforceable government building codes working (Hati vs. Japan earthquakes), but would like evidence that these private ones would work.

"learnmath","t5_2rdi4","Say you have a complex number z = x + iy

ln (z) = ln(x+iy).  Another representation of z would be in polar form, i.e. z = re^i(theta) .  If we substitute this definition of z into our logarithm, we get something pretty interesting:

ln(z) = ln(re^i(theta) ) = ln(r) + ln(e^i(theta) ) = ln(r) + i(theta), using standard logarithm properties.

Now, we must be careful in how we express the angle when we convert to polar form because e^i(theta) = e^i(theta)+2(pi)k , for any integer k.  As a result, we need to define a branch cut when dealing with logarithms.  Look at the Wikipedia article:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm


Edit:  for some of the other questions, this might help:

e^ix = cosx + isinx

e^-ix = cos(-x) + isin(-x) = cos(x) - isin(x) [Since cos is an even function and sin is odd].


Now, can you solve for cos(x) and sin(x) using those two equations above?  Using that definition, try finding what sin(3 pi i) is.","1322697662"

Alabama might just be the second best team in the country, but who's to say that Oklahoma State wouldn't dominate LSU?  My guess is that it wouldn't happen, but it's a guess in the end.  If Michigan got their re-match against Ohio State in 2006, Florida would have never gotten their chance to pummel Ohio State.

If Alabama didn't play LSU and only had one lose to say Arkansas (of course they'd be devoid of their only great win) then they'd have a case.  The problem is though, they lost to LSU at home.  That loss in my opinion  holds more value than an Oklahoma State loss on the road in double OT, even if it was to Iowa State.  Alabama had the advantage  and opportunity and blew it.","1322697662"

The thing is, the province loses $500 million to $1 billion annually in taxes that WOULD have been paid had the cigarettes been bought legally.

It's also an issue with parents because contraband cigarettes are so easily available to kids. A guy who's selling illegal cigarettes isn't going to card high school kids, right? So now we have kids smoking cheap cigs that should be costing a minimum of $6 (the cheapest brand here is around that much for a 20 pack) but the illegal ones can be as cheap as $2, and they're even worse for you than regular smokes.

I just found that personally, if I didnt have 3+ targets and thus 3+ chances to hit fulmination and receive my mana return, I was ooming faster than preferred.  However, i did not notice enough of a DPS increase to personally justify this.  And also my belief in LB scaling with gear better is just that, a belief.  If I'm right, then by time you are fully decked in 378 and replacing with 397, you will be casting LBs no matter what on single target because it will be better dps.

so i figured i didnt have any stuff to move so now is the time to do it. i said goodbyes and moved to melbourne (it is like a 4 hour plane trip so i wouldnt be seeing a lot of people again). any way melbourne was really cool, met this girl, it was great. i was living with my aunt and uncle for a while so i decided to move in with my girlfriend, she was living with her best friend and her best friends mother. 

then, maybe a year after i moved, my best friend finally saved enough money for a visit. he stayed with us and he hit it off with my girlfriends best friend. after another visit 2 months later, she moved up to my old home town to be with him. that was 4 years ago.

Problem is, Brazil is going to need power to expand its economy, even at the modest rates it has been expanding for the last decade, and that expansion will benefit the poorest drastically.

You should definitely speak to the VP about the bullying you're receiving as a result of it by the other students. It's not acceptable, and needs to go on record. The school will be responsible for it from there. If they don't act on it to reign in the other students, get your school board trustee involved.    

Here's a suggestion when you speak to administration: you may wish to bring something to present as well. Maybe some stats about teen and gay bullying and suicide, or the It Gets Better videos, I think, are brilliant. You could give positive actions that the school can do as well. For example, maybe suggest a GSA club, or something that will help educate the students.

The difference between 1.82 and 1.75 (0.8) sounds much smaller than the difference between 6'0"" and 5'9"" (3).

Many metric measurements become fractional at human scales, and I suspect people don't grok fractional/decimal number as well as nice whole numbers.  Sure, you could express height in decimeters, but for some reason that hasn't really caught on, probably for the same reason dekameters and hectameter never really caught on.

I can definitely agree that these companies are greedy and jack up the prices to an extent, but it's still very expensive. For one, the tools you need can easily cost millions of dollars. The precursors (ingredients) can also be very expensive depending on what you are doing. Also, people sometimes don't realize how painstakingly delicate some of the lab techniques are. I worked in an organic chemistry lab so that's very comparable to pharmaceutical research. From my experience, getting good yield and getting a pure product (or purifying your crude product) are two VERY HARD things to do and they are VERY IMPORTANT to developing medicine. For reference, look into a drug called Thalidomide. One of it's enantiomers (which is a mirror image of the molecule, which means synthesis of this molecule produces a 50:50 mixture of these two enantiomers. It's generally VERY VERY hard to seperate enantiomers because they have the same chemical properties. However, enzymes in the body are sensitive to different enantiomers so the wrong enantiomer can cause a completely different response from the body) caused birth defects while it's other treated morning sickness. I believe ibuprofen is also synthesized as a racemic (50:50) of two enantiomers. Luckily the enantiomers of ibuprofen both do the same thing, one is just more potent than the other.

He even claimed in the linked piece that the courts made the ""distinction"" that a child within the womb is not protected under law, when the ""distinction"" they made was that a viable fetus is subject to protection under law and thus states can regulate post-viability abortions. The Partial Birth Abortion Ban is increased infringement on state's ability to decide on abortion.

Ron Paul signed a pledge to never raise taxes, support new taxes, or remove credits without offsetting them. Ron Paul voted to increase the tax burden for women receiving abortions and insurance companies that offer plans that cover them. 

Ron Paul called Francis Bellamy an atheist in an attempt to criticize and discredit the man. It is hard to do *any* research on Francis Bellamy without it being abundantly clear that the man was a baptist minister and Christian socialist. You don't even have to [click the links in a Google search](http://www.google.com/search?gcx=w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=francis+bellamy) to find the information 

In the same [paper](http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul205.html) where Ron Paul made the above claim about Bellamy, he also claimed that preventing federal courts from hearing challenges to the *federal* law that sets forth the pledge and how it is to be said is a protection of state's rights. If Ron Paul wants states to decide how they say the pledge, limiting challenges to the federal law that sets forth how it is to be said is not a way to reach that goal. This whole paper doesn't even make sense. It is not an abuse of federal power for a federal court to declare federal law in violation of the constitution and fighting to protect the federal law that sets forth the pledge is not a protection of state's rights.

The key to our work has been to find a way to estimate the evolution of a personal budget over time. 
We now have many users in France, who use it to plan and monitor their budget and projects. We just published the english version of the tool, and the next step for us is to see if it fits user needs in the US and other countries, who may have different spending or budgeting habits. Maybe you would like to give a shot?
Our application is called BudgetView, and you can find it here:

Not being trite, but there are only a few possibilities.
1. Retreat further into the warm embrace of willful ignorance
2. Face their fears and learn what they can
3. Ignore all evidence to the contrary and continue to believe, possibly redefining any bits that are painfully not in alignment to make it easier to digest.

Given human nature and history, most believers will choose #3. This is why we have a God of the Gaps fallacy and failed arguments such as irreducible complexity. The sad thing is that most their need could be met by a philosophy rather than a religion, such as humanism. Over time, as parents put less effort into indoctrination, I expect this to be less of an issue, with fewer seeking religion as a means of facing death, and more seeking actual answers, or accepting the possibility that death is final.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Oh hey, Art Director here to give you a serious answer to this.

First thing's first, you need to understand something. Advertising doesn't exist because someone wants to sell you something. Advertising exists because TV Companies, Cities, Websites, Magazines, everything else wants to make money.

Think of it this way, when a company makes a magazine that's say 200 pages they will only fill 100 of it with editorial content. The rest they leave blank because they want corporations to buy the ad space.

It's the same reason why a normal sitcom is only 24 minutes long, they have to make space for ads so someone like NBC or CBS can make revenue. 

If there would be a world without ads it would hurt normal people the most. A newspaper without ads would cost $4 when it should cost $1. Network TV wouldn't be free anymore and would cost you maybe $40 a month. Tolls on highways would skyrocket because there would be no billboards.

Now I'm sure you say that we can just go by stuff like donations or subscriptions. Have you ever listened to NPR or watched PBS? Half or even more of their on screen time is spent asking for contributions.

Also look at how it is right now. If you own a TV you can currently watch  a show like How I Met Your Mother for free... yet people STILL pirate it online. 

Also I don't know what you're talking about when it comes to stuff like the New York Times. That and all newspapers are dying hard right now, even with subscriptions and paywalls. In fact, paywalls are the main reason they're dying even faster. Are you oblivious to all the buyouts that are happening with every single newspaper?

People don't realize it but they're being just as greedy as corporations for wanting a world without advertising, because they don't know what the ramifications would be without it. Hate that you're paying for $60 for cable with ads? Well without ads it would be $120. 

Think about it this way, why is it that a magazine like Cosmo can be sold at $6 but an art magazine which is the same size and made of the same material be sold for $12? Don't listen to the bullshit, it's not because of the content inside, it's because of the ads. Coca-Cola would gladly pay $200,000 to Cosmo to have ads in there while an artist will pay maybe $1,000 to the art magazine for the very same space for an ad. At the end of the day both magazines are in the same place and have to account for the same amount of costs and the consumer ends up getting the short stick.

Seriously, people just need to understand that ads exist only to make things cheaper and make stuff more available. Why is it that services like Pandora and Spotify exist but still need ads? It's not because they are looking to nickel and dime you, it's because even when something is free you still need to upkeep the servers and have a staff to work on it.

I don't get what's wrong with our generation, if you don't like an ad why not just ignore it? Are you really that ungrateful that you can't enjoy a TV you want to watch if it has commercial breaks which allow that show to exist? 

Don't tell me that pirating them or watching it online is a viable solution too. If you like your show support it by watching it in it's timeslot. No one gives a fuck if you go on TPB and watch it later, in fact you're even worse because in terms of analytics you are not on the grid at all. That's how shows like Community get canned despite everyone liking it. Those same people who like it don't watch it when you are supposed to. ","1322697729"

"HeroesofNewerth","t5_2r497","Midas is the opposite--he was delayed too long. The first version of him didn't have a blink. Instead, he had a vector wall, putting him much more heavily into a support role. He was supposed to come after Moraxus or Myrmidon (I don't remember which) but was delayed continuously. He was delayed even further when Empath was chosen before him, meaning he could no longer have a vector wall. I gave him an ability called ""Black Powder Blast"" instead, which was basically just an expanding PBAoE damage ability. But when we finally picked Midas to enter the queue, I was told that it was too similar to Amun-Ra's Ignite, so I had to make it different yet again. That's when it was modified into the final version.

Sylph actually had a very similar fate. She was supposed to be added before Empath (and I was told that she was going to be), but then Aluna was inserted into the queue, and because Aluna fulfilled a somewhat similar role to Sylph, she was delayed. Then again, when Sylph was about to enter the queue, we picked Emerald Warden, which delayed Sylph even further.

EDIT:
To clarify even further, I don't regret giving him a blink. It fit perfectly because it gave him that positioning advantage to shoot off his skill shots. I do regret, however, releasing him at a time when almost every one of our heroes had an escape. It really skewed public perception negatively.","1322697731"

Why should he thanking God for success and praying on his own on the sideline be such a bother to us.

"Catacombs","t5_2t5r5","Yes, the idea that Satan/the Devil/Lucifer is in hell is actually from extra-Biblical sources.  That popular image of the Devil currently torturing people in Hell is un-Biblical

According to the Bible, Satan is still upon the earth:

First, [Job 1:6-7](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=job%201:6-1:7&amp;version=ESV): Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.  The LORD said to Satan, ""From where have you come?"" Satan answered the LORD and said, ""**From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it**.""

Similarly, in [1 peter 5:8](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+peter%205:8-5:8&amp;version=ESV) - Be sober-minded; be watchful. **Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion**, seeking someone to devour.

I'm not all knowledgeable on this issue either, so I found this breakdown of Biblical references to the Devil to be helpful: [list here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_teaching_about_the_Devil#Sources_of_Christian_teaching)","1322697740"

"NewIsrael","t5_2t49r","&gt; Israel, supported by the United States, has been fighting the Nazis for 63 years. That Iron Wall approach, which sees all of Israel’s enemies as reincarnations of Hitler (as in Jeffrey Goldberg’s propagandistic assertion that Hezbollah and Hamas “specialize in the slaughter of innocent Jews”) has been a calamitous failure. It has not made Israel safer. As even center-right Israeli politicians like Tzipi Livni now recognize, it has resulted in Israel becoming increasingly isolated from the world, much of which now sees it as a pariah.

&gt; And Israel will not be given another 63 years. If it continues down this path, aided by its false “friends” in the U.S. who insist on fighting Hitler-redux to the last Israeli (and the last American), Israel is doomed. But if it abandons its self-defeating Holocaustology, it will be able to live in peace with its neighbors and join the world.

-- Gary Kamiya, [""The boys who cry 'Holocaust'”](http://www.salon.com/2011/11/22/the_boys_who_cry_holocaust/), *salon.com*, 22 Nov 2011

I would only add that the Zionists have become the very thing that they pretend to hate.  

&gt; Hitlerism is Satan's nationalism. The determination to rid the German national body of the Jewish element, however, led Hitlerism to discover its ""kinship"" with Zionism, the Jewish nationalism of liberation.  

&gt; Therefore Zionism became the only other party legalized in the Reich, the Zionist flag the only other flag permitted to fly in Nazi-land.  

&gt; It was a painful distinction for Zionism to be singled out for favors and privileges by its Satanic counterpart.

-- Stephen Wise, *Congress Bulletin*, quoted by Lenni Brenner, *Zionism in the Age of Dictators*, p. 85-86

Fascism is the ideology of national suicide.  The choice between New Israel and Old Israel is a choice between life and ignominious death.  

Those who choose the the insanity of military aggression will die in the gutter, drowning in blood, universally despised.  But this does not have to be Israel's fate.  The Zionists still have time to sober up.  Some already have:

"programming","t5_2fwo","The only extension that particular module uses is `OverloadedStrings` which allows string literals to be polymorphic in their type, as opposed to always being of type `String`. This basically allows you to write a string literal `""foo""` in a context where a `ByteString` or a `Text` is needed, for example. Normally you would have to convert the raw `String` directly into the type you want, via a function like `pack` or something.

You can make this work for arbitrary string-like types by merely making your data type an instance of the typeclass `IsString`, which has one method: `isString :: String -&gt; a`. The compiler takes care of the rest.

I would say this is not a very complex extension at all, and the module in question isn't a very good example. `OverloadedStrings` is a convenience more than anything, and otherwise that module is pretty standard, run of the mill Haskell code.","1322697759"

The revenge aspect of GoW3 came to a head with [Kratos bashing in Zeus's skull with his fists. This is in the form of an interactive cutscene that ends with a repeated tapping of the square button. Each punch adds a little more blood to the screen, until you can't see anymore. Yet, it never tells you to stop, nor just cuts to another scene. It'll go on as long as you keep hitting the button, which for me was a little while.](/spoiler) When I finally realized what was going on, I was impressed at how well they had given me a platform to enact my vengeance. At the same time, they revealed how monstrous that revenge could make you.

Red Dead takes a similar, but opposite approach. [After John's betrayal and death, you seek revenge. But that's over so quickly, with just one gunfight, that it doesn't feel like enough. It didn't assuage my anguish at all, it left me wanting more revenge, but there was none left to get.](/spoiler) That's what seemed so brilliant to me about each of those games.

Some people are fucked in the head.

You can never understand their worldview because it's based on thousands of misconceptions and distorted rationalisations.

They don't care what you think, they live for self-gratification moment by moment. They live to please themselves and everyone else can go and get fucked. That's if they even think about anyone else at all.

They're the ones killing kids in Skyrim, they're the ones who ram you off the track in GT5, they're the ones who spend months befriending you in an MMO and then steal all your stuff.

They just don't care about anything except themselves. You can't reason with them, you can't understand them, and you can't avoid them. They enjoy ruining your free time because it's the most real human contact they receive. It's hard to be a decent person sometimes, but it's the easiest thing in the world to be an asshole all the time.

The world is not comprised of rational people, there is a large percentage of pure assholes out there. You may not have met them in your social circle because those kinds of people cannot make real friends, they just can't - nobody wants to be around them. But they thrive online, and we've all met them there.

Some people make excuses for them, citing deprivations of one kind or another, or ""tough upbringings"", but the fact is they're just assholes, and they always will be.","1322697763"

The first book (9 Princes in Amber) is nearly as old as I am (pub.1970) -if you ignore Galaxy Mag which ran the first few books in '67-69.

While it COULD be done with todays CGI and graphics, I just don't think it's popular enough for a studio to take a risk on it as most of the folks that read this are now in the 'over 49 and therefore invisible to marketing' group.

Just my .02

Awesome read btw. I had the original hardcovers as a child gifted to me and went back just a year or two ago and got this 'all in one' edition I linked to at Amazon and it holds up amazingly well 40 years later.

Highly recommended ","1322697781"
"Freethought","t5_2qhzx","You are obviously extremely intelligent, I enjoyed reading your argument, especially seeing George Carlin there.

The TLDR here should be that many many people are inherently servile, whether it be to god or state. They look down on free thinkers and people who do not wish to be servile because it is scary to them to live a life without an authority which also protects them.  God and state are literally interchangeable here, and what is all the more interesting is that people who tend to be more religious tend to be more ""patriotic"". You don't see too many religious socialists, but I have never met a conservative that wasn't religious.

***Physically***, the sensation for me was very similar to moderate to severe thirst. You know how you feel on a hot day when you're just dying for a drink of cool water? Imagine that, but in your chest.

***Psychologically***, it's like being a child who wants something sweet. You see the juice box at the grocery store and you are fucking COMPELLED by it. You want that shit, you want it bad. Mom just said ""sure"" and is buying you some? Fuck yeah, you feel good, this shit is just what you were after. You don't feel thirsty anymore and you chill the fuck out.

But if mom says no? Fuck that bitch, you're in a shitty mood now, everything is trying your patience, you're crabby as fuck now, everything that can go wrong will go wrong and when it does, you'll be 50 fucking million times more annoyed by it than you would have been if mom would have just given you the goddamn juice box. Meanwhile, you're fucking thirsty and you know exactly what would fix that, a goddamned juice box that you can't have. Fuck this shit.

Juice box = nicotine, thirst is the sensation in your mind and lungs, mom is circumstance that either allows you to have a cig or not. At .5pack/day, the child comes out demanding juicebox about once every 1.75-2.5 hours and he's fucking pissed if he doesn't get his juicebox.

So, I bought speakers and a head unit and had them installed there.  I get in my car and it sounded like absolute shit, so I said to the guy, this doesn't sound right at all.  My 1993 stock Honda tape deck sounded better.  He said that's just how it sounds (bullshit).  So I said OK, I take the car home, and drive it around to see if I am just losing it.  I decide to go back and tell them I think the wires are flipped or a connection is loose somewhere or that the head unit is bad (and of course, I bought the last one, they didn't have another in stock).  They take the head unit out and look at it and put it back.  Nope, they said everything was fine.  They didn't bother checking the speakers or the wiring.  

I ended up taking it to Car Toys at Park Meadows, within 15 seconds of sitting in my car, the guy says ""phasing"".  Yup, wires were crossed.  They fixed me up and had me out the door in 20 minutes, no charge.  If you're gonna do Car Toys, I definitely recommend Park Meadows.  They were friendly, quick to assist, professional, and apologetic for their idiot counterparts on B'way.  

Not only were the 6th and Broadway guys incompetent, They acted like the last thing they wanted to do was come out from the back and help me when I came back in.  I had to hover around the desk and walk by their office door a few times.  Also, the install originally took about an hour longer than it was supposed to.  Why?  Because the installers left to go get a shitload of munchies from 7-11 and took their sweet time.  So, yeah, unprofessional, incompetent.  Don't go to 6th and B'way Car Toys.  ","1322697785"

my brother pointed out to me that nate allen, kurt coleman, jaiquawn jarrett, etc etc are all fairly decent at best. they've made plays, they've missed plays. he went on to say that most great defenses, especially modern ones, have had a great safety behind it: troy polamalu, ed reed, john lynch, BRIAN DAWKINS. our defense will never be great until we find a safety who can dominate the field. dawkins left here and we assumed we could find a replacement for him like that *snaps fingers* but we didn't and we seem terribly incapable of doing so. in fact, come to think of it (and this goes hand in hand with the new DC thing), the defensive players that andy has drafted after jimmy's crew has been grossly ineffective at a lot of times. in fact, with the exception of trent cole, not one of them has made the pro bowl.

where am i going with this?

i forget, but i think i can wind this whole thing up nicely.

we need a new superstar safety that can play 5 yards off the line and fuck somebody's day up, or drop back 30 yards and ballhawk like a boss. and before we get that, we need a defensive coordinator who actually knows what a defense is and can recognize a great defensive draft prospect.

"counter_strike","t5_2rwyx","You have to have a lot of drive and determination to get into the competitive scene of older hardcore games like CS1.6.

Unfortunately, there really isn't much help in the way of instructional knowledge being available to someone getting into the game.  This is a sad state of affairs because this kind of knowledge base needs to be created for this game to survive.

There are still some resources out there.  The website www.winout.net has some videos and articles that are instructional in nature, but most of them can only be accessed with a premium account.  You can find videos of tactics on video websites like YouTube, but they may be edited poorly or have bad commentary.  In addition to knowing how a tactic goes, you need to know what it accomplishes and why.

The best track to go now is a pub server to learn the very basics, then immediately start playing scrimmages or 10-mans to learn team play, then try to create or join a team.  This whole process could take months or even a year.  Don't bother with ESEA pugs - they are a complete waste of time and life.

Watching demos is one of the most efficient ways to learn the game.  Check out www.hltv.org and look at the HLTV demos of international matches, or the POV demos of top players.  Sometimes it can be hard to get insight from a level of game play far above your own, so you can also go to ESEA's website and just download some matches from ESEA-Invite or ESEA-Main.  Demos can teach you just about everything if you pay attention - spots to play, grenade angles, how to work as a team, and tactics or plans.

For aim and weapon control, I recommend you practice on a LAN server with bots.  For the package and explanation of how to do so, reference my thread:

http://esea.net/index.php?s=forums&amp;d=topic&amp;id=330317&amp;find_comment_number=10#n10

Based on what I know about the game, this is by far the most efficient and effective method to hone your weapon control.  With just 15 minutes a day of doing this you can learn control of a weapon in a week or regain control that you've lost from a long break in a few days.

Once again, stay the hell away from ESEA pugs.  If you want to learn how to suck at team CS and how to lose control of yourself in blind rage, then they are the right choice.","1322697790"

"canada","t5_2qh68","Crap, that's what I get for slacking off at work. And fantasizing about my SKS (x39, I know) at the same time the confusing the two. 

Aside from that, I was trying to illustrate the difference between a ""hunting rifle"" and sniper rifle is pretty much nil. It's who's using it and who's defining it defines what the rifle supposedly is. 

If I was on the range more than 3 or 4 times per year, I could probably tune my rifles and my ability to the point where I'm shooting a nickle sized hole at 100 yards (with my .17 hmr - the thing's a tack driver, probably not with my SKS, for I'd be happy with a target clay sized grouping) and further, and teach others to do the same. But hitting a target at 2.5 kms? Not likely. [Craig Harrison, who currently holds the longest sniper kill in the world needed to take nine shots to get properly ranged in before he took his first actual shot at a target](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Harrison_(sniper\)#Record_details). Not many people without specific training could pull that off. And if someone were to pick up a rifle with no prior experience and no idea how to use sights ([these come to mind](http://www.thegunzone.com/glock/images/nyte-sytes.jpg)), the effect would probably be laughable. Most people I know who don't shoot and have never handled a gun think it's point and squeeze the trigger. The bullet will magically go wherever you want it. I can't expect gangbangers to think much more than that either. 

I agree that the .308 can take most Ontario game, but I have seen Moose need multiple shots from .308's, .32 Winchester Specials*, .30-30's and the like. I'd rather go a slight bit bigger in the .300/7 mm magnum range to make sure I have enough power with my first shot. I had a lacrosse/hockey coach take a Moose every year that I played for him with his .338 Win Mag, which put that idea in my head.

But at the end of the day we're on the same side and nitpicking each other, haha. I just wish I had more time, money and a dedicated range (all the ranges near me are a year+ waitlist).

*My Marlin Model 36, chambered for the aforementioned .32 Win. Spec. with Federal Vital Shok 180 grain rounds too four shots to take down a Moose. All hit centre mass (one not quite making it through the scapula), but didn't penetrate as deeply as I wished. Most of my hunting buddies have needed multiple shots as well, and have lead to many upping to a larger/magnum calibre.","1322697792"

"Watches","t5_2qls5","Here you go [source](http://www.timezone.com/library/wwatchfaq/wwatchfaq631668591017665598):

Higher grade watches have traditionally used a jeweled movements, which means that jewels (originally natural ruby, now synthetic ruby) were actually used in the movement. These jewels are functional - they are used as the bearings for the wheel trains and in high wear parts such as the escape lever and impulse jewel.
A lower-end movement from before 1970 would typically use 5 or 7 jewels; this end of the market has pretty much been taken over by quartz.  Nowadays, most manual wind watches will have a standard complement of 17 jewels, which are:

1:    Impulse jewel (the part of the balance wheel assembly which receives a kick from the escape lever) 

2-5:   Balance staff pivot bearings (two pairs - in combinations of one pivot jewel (i.e. jewel with a hole to receive the axle (pivot) of the wheel) and one cap jewel (i.e. jewel without a hole outboard of the pivot jewel, to prevent excessive movement of the balance staff), usually shock protected) 

6-7:   Escape lever pallets (one pair) 

8-9:   Escape lever pivot bearings (one pair) 

10-11: Escape wheel pivot bearings (one pair) 

12-13: Fourth wheel pivot bearings (one pair) 

14-15: Third wheel pivot bearings (one pair) 

16-17: Center wheel pivot bearings (one pair) 

Note that automatic winding movements, and movements with additional functions such as chronographs and calendars, can up the total number of jewels tremendously. For example, the IWC Il Destriero Scafusia (claimed to be among the most complicated wristwatches manufactured) has a total of 76 jewels to accommodate the time, perpetual calendar, rattrapante chronograph, repeater, and tourbillon functions - and this is a manual wind watch.","1322697797"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt; I'm trying to show that, although there will (most likely, at least) be some kind of correlation between bread consumption and drug use, the two have nothing to do with each other... minus the obvious munchies.

I'm curious, what's the basis of this?  At first, I didn't expect there to be any correlation at all.  But you pointed out the munchies (which I'll agree might have some effect).  But that's a direct causation link.

Usually if you want to show that correlation doesn't equal causation, it's easier to pick two things (A and B) that are both caused by something else (C).  A and B will have a high correlation with each other, but no causation link.

For example: I bet there's a huge correlation between people who have luxury watches and people who have luxury cars.  But obviously there's no causation between the two.  The correlation is explained by a third uncontrolled factor (wealth).

Anyways, I did the survey.  I'd also like to note that the mods here do a great job.  You guys let things flow as they are meant to and step in when needed.  When something arises that needs attention, it is dealt with in a pretty decent time span.  From the mod stand point no problem with the relaxed atmosphere.  


Having people mandated to post their location IN the title is a good idea..I hate to be *that one* but, realistically...all that info is there and thensome on the sidebar.  I don't see this improving since there is already a lack of reading going on...how in the world will they know there's a change...they don't read to begin with! ARG!!!!


I don't think making it so there is only a request with location and nothing more there.  It might discourage giving in the sense that nobody is relating or able to find *that thing* that makes them want to give.  I do agree the poor me stuff is overwhelming and sometimes unbelievable.

I'm sorry, what were you saying?


Edit: And this was only using the word ""anarchy."" ""Anarchism"" gives results even more relevant to what we're clearly talking about.
For example, The American Heritage College Dictionary defines Anarchism as ""The theory or doctrine that all forms of government are unnecessary, oppressive, and undesirable and should be abolished.""
Words are nuanced, okay? Especially ones with long histories like anarchism.

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","Every couple/person has to define their relationship boundaries for themselves. Personally, I've anecdotally found that don't ask/don't tell have a higher failure rate than relationships where each partner knows who the other person is flirting/sleeping/in love with.

From where I'm standing, it's perfectly reasonable for you to want to meet your wife's partners. In my poly family, it would NEVER fly to have any kind of sexual relationship with someone without them getting tested and without them meeting everyone else, and ESPECIALLY if I didn't know their name. Sounds like a bit of a red flag to me, though I could see the ""stranger"" aspect being somewhat of a turn on to some people.

But like I said, it's up to every couple to set their own boundaries. It's good to have conversations to re-establish or to reframe them pretty often, so one partner doesn't feel like the other is ""making up rules as they go"" - but you know what? Sometimes you don't know how you'll feel until you're in a particular situation.","1322697814"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","I have a  similar story, but mine happened in 2003. While reading The Diary of Anne Frank in my Catholic middle school, we were to do activities to go along with it. First we were all forced to wear Stars of David on our uniforms with numbers the teacher gave us and we had to remember the number. If they saw us in the hall way without the star, our star got a hole punched in it, if we didn't know our number, it got a hole punched in it. 

They also wanted us to take showers in the dark to replicate what Anne Frank and her family went through. 

To top it all off, we played a game at the end of the year, kind of like hide and go seek. All the kids had to hide through out the classrooms and the one teacher would come in and pretend to be the Gestapo and he would yell really loud and shit. really messed up. So they would find kids and capture them, and so the objective was to not get caught because you are supposed to be a jew in hiding during WWII. The whole experience was really fucked up. 

tl;dr my catholic middle school made us wear the star of david on our shirts and made us hide out from the gestapo ","1322697819"

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","Not everyone has an iPhone, many people do, but not everyone does. The problem is that there are only a few iPhones which have cases that can work for several versions of them. Then take Android, there are dosens of android devises which all have unique sizes and shapes. That's the real problem, each individual phone version way undersells each iPhone version. So that means way less sales for cases for specific droid phones, so companies that make cases don't put as much effort into those.

Here are 4 articles from this year that say that more people have android phones then iPhones:

[Android shoots past iPhone OS in market share](http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/mobile-devices/2011/05/19/android-shoots-past-iphone-os-in-market-share-40092829/)

[Android Clobbering Everyone, iPhone Dead In The Water](http://articles.businessinsider.com/2011-04-26/tech/29964680_1_google-s-android-iphone-sales-apple-fans)

[Android Sales Overtake iPhone in the U.S.](http://gigaom.com/2010/08/02/android-sales-overtake-iphone-in-the-u-s/)

[Android Saw Twice As Many Buyers As iPhone Over The Past 3 Months](http://techcrunch.com/2011/09/26/android-vs-iphone-sales/)

I don't like to stereotype but I also came across some articles based on statistics of who buys the phones, and iPhones are much more likely to be purchased by women, who are more likely to buy a fancy case. Men are more likely to go with a plain case or no case. And cases seem to be a lot more important to the iPhone user base then Android users, I don't know why, probably good marketing.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Whats happening is that you are going to a single source of information (i.e. IPCC) and not getting a broader opinion on the science. A single source is a flawed way of approaching anything

The IPCC is not a single source, rather it is a collection of various contributions from climate scientists worldwide.

In any case, I'm not going to the IPCC, I'm going to the original authors, to read the original research articles.

&gt;Imagine if you were to speak with someone that only got their news from FoxNews

I imagine he would be as badly informed as you are, i.e. he would likely believe there isn't a consensus about AGW among scientists. There is.

&gt;You missed the point. It doesn't matter if they over or under-estimated, the point was that they were wrong. 

No, *you* miss the point. The fact that they underestimate is that the situation is even further from your own position than the IPCC will publicly state.

&gt;Remember that correlation is not causation, so a under-estimation of temperature indicates that CO2 isn't the driver that they are claiming it is.

That doesn't even make sense, you're simply repeating tropes and adding an half-assed argument to it.

It is not because the IPCC underestimates that AGW theory is correct, AGW theory is correct because the evidence supports it, period.

&gt;They really want carbon to the key driver, because that is how they can make their money.

Conspiracy theory.

&gt; If however the Sun is the key driver,

Good think we can verify this. We did. It isn't.

&gt;because nobody is going to pay increased taxes 

It's not about fucking taxes, it's about the world your kids and grandkids will live in.

&gt;How about we compromise?

Compromise about what? The evidence is the evidence.

&gt;How about I acknowledge global warming is horrible, but you promise you'll never force me to spend money on it?

It's going to cost a lot more for everyone if we don't do nothing about it. I see you're as misinformed about economics as you are about climate science...

&gt;You can't accept this, because then it removes all motivation to stir things up in the first place.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;If that were the case I would think my feelings of reverance for coincidence/luck would be as profound as my belief in a higher power. 

Put the shoe on the other foot, this is why so many atheist fight just as hard for non-belief, as those who fight for theistic belief. Because it IS just as important to atheists, as a theists beliefs are to them.

And now that the shoe is on the other foot, (and we are being civil)... I will point out that I have a much higher respect for almost all theistic religions than my comment history would show. I see great good done by many religions. You don't need me to tell you that if you need help with food, alcoholism, substance abuse, sexual abuse, etc, that the majority of programs out there are faith based. I have been on the ""front lines"" in many community events with many Christians, so I know that they are out there in the real world doing more good than most other groups.

Indeed, my own five y/o is just as Christian as any other five y/o,... because I agree that a good moral base is important for children, and why shouldn't that come from religion? It's what my, and most everyone's ethics are based on anyway. My only problem is that Christianity (spoiler alert - major generalization upcoming) has become anti-science and against pro-choice. And I worry, that if I don't have a talk with my 5 y/o soon about how what she has been taught is just one of many world views, she will ~~lose~~ never develop her ability to think critically, logically, and objectively.

It's not that I disagree with what you do, I find great value in what you do, it's that I disagree with why.

Anyway, thank you for your response, and I do apologize for my ""typical Chrisitan"" comment. It was hasty, ill-informed, and ALSO did not contribute to the conversation.","1322697822"

I would just like to say kudos to everyone in the State for driving FAR better. FL has THE worst drivers. My Mom got T-boned by a elderly driver who was released from a hospital on medication. I delivered pizzas through high-school and have been driven literally off the road by people and had countless near-hits. Senior citizen rolling road blocks. Plus so many uninsured drivers its scary.

Montana really doesn't need a speed limit IMHO. Most of the state is pretty open and kind of a boring drive. 

Your biggest threat is wildlife crossing the road. The other threat is the more western portions are a bit rougher to drive because of the Rockies. If you want to drive fast through mountain passes or in wet/icey conditions it's your prerogative. Even at 75mph there is some places it's stupid to do so. Much less population here so your really only putting yourself at risk if you choose to do so. That's why it was 'safe and prudent' for a long time.

ESPN: Received a tape from someone who HAD ALREADY REPORTED the incident to the police; police chose not to pursue the case. Since when is ESPN required to report incidents that the police themselves don't choose to pursue?

If the media was required to report every allegation that people sent in, we'd be stuck with the Salem Witch Trials. There is a sane, logical, fair process for upholding the law-- and it beings with contacting the police. Private citizens are not required to do anything more than that.

I sort of fell in love with it, so I've been using saint images in my worship a bit too. I felt a little uncomfortable with it at first, but after quite a bit of prayer and questioning it's just become a regular part of my practice and doesn't seem weird at all anymore. So I get the interest you have and I'll try some suggestions. 

What about some not-technically-Christian art? Brian Froud's Faeries Oracle deck has a card called Himself that is a Horned God type but always looked like Jesus to me back when I used this deck as a Christian. I've noticed that pretty often, actually - a lot of Green Man or Horned God imagery reminds me of Jesus, and vice versa. So if you look enough, you might find something like this that could be understood either way. For Baldur, the Infant of Prague comes to mind for me. St. Anthony might be another match for Daghda, though I'm really not familiar with Celtic mythology and gods so I'm just going by your description of wise father. ","1322697839"

- During the tournament at Harrenhell a mystery knight with a laughing heart tree on their shield impressed Rhaegar and infuriated his father Aerys when they would not reveal themself.

- Howland Reed (the only survivor of the Tower of Joy incident) told a story to his children Meera and Jojen which they later repeated to Bran about Lyanna saving him from a group of men that tried to assault him.

- Rhaegar was ordered by King Aerys to find this mystery knight 

- The mystery knight was short of stature compared to most knights, which suggests a woman - Lyanna to be specific

[Speculation](/g ""Now here's how I see it, Rhaegar finds this mystery knight and discovers it is Lyanna Stark -- falls in love with her and crowns her queen of love and beauty the next day of the tournament after this mystery knight had 'vanished'"")

[Speculation](/g ""After the tournament Rhaegar and Lyanna elope as a Targaryen is able to have multiple wives and the dragon has three heads etc Knowing Elia could bare him no more children it seemed to him like something he had to do"")

[Speculation](/g ""We know Lyanna already had a fondness for Rhaegar as she cried while he played his famous silver harp and her brothers knew she wasnt the type to show emotion like Arya"")

[Speculation](/g ""So, at the tower of joy near the end of the rebellion Aerys and Rhaegar are dead. Ned is coming for his sister without Robert Baratheon as he was wounded and there are three Kingsguard knights guarding Lyanna, now why else would they be guarding Lyanna at the height of the rebellion unless her child was king at the time."")

[Speculation](/g ""Jon Snow would have been the true heir at that moment -- once the kingsguard were dead there was no way Jon could be presented to Robert as a Targaryen and live ESPECIALLY since Lyanna gave birth to him....the woman he started that rebellion for in the first place"")

I used Aela for a while, gave her Wuuthrad and wen't okish but she never really said anything and basically just followed me killed mobs and got lost. At some point she died and I gave her a burrial.

Next I used Erandur for levels 25-35ish. He has quite a lot of different things he says in towns and dungeons which is quite fun. I gave him all the staves I had and he was pretty good with them. Things were going ok. As long as we were crawling dungeons with the two of us.

Then lateron I had to do more quests with other NPCs. The staves he used had splash damage and he kept getting in mortal fights with other NPCs with no way to break them up, forcing me to load an earlier save. Also, for some reason he just refused to weir robes I gave him. And of course he got lost all the time or stood in doorways. In the end I got sick of all the bugs and send him away.

I actually picked it up (along with the sequel and the expansions) on Steam a couple months ago. Haven't played through the expansions yet, though I've heard the same things - that they're not as good. F.E.A.R. 2 does take a bit of a dive on the horror/story aspects, but the combat aspect is more varied (in F.E.A.R. the starting pistol is pretty much the best weapon in the game - I kind of enjoyed it, but it's certainly not standard FPS practice). 

The ending of F.E.A.R. 2 is... out there. It's one of the more edgy, hey-you-crossed-the-line-fifty-yards-ago kind of things I've seen a video game (or even a movie) do. So it might be worth it from that aspect.","1322697856"

It's only when she sees the Triforce mark on his hand that she knows he's a fated hero (not already a hero).

When Link meets Zelda for the first time, she shows no recognition of him and no acknowledgement of any past meetings. 

LA's manual says that Link left Hyrule to go on a journey after defeating Ganon, basically to prepare himself/train for future threats. In OoS/OoA, Link had no intention of going anywhere; he was called to his quest by the Triforce.

Link is also younger looking in OoS/OoA than ALttP/LA.

I agree that they weren't going for timeline connections with those games, which is part of why I doubt they have the same Link as any other games. But they do need to occur at a time when the complete Triforce is in Hyrule, since it's at the start of the game, and Ganon needs to be dead for Twinrova to be trying to revive him.","1322697859"

There is no point in forming a safe haven from persecution if you are a minority in a country where the people supported and helped have half of your population executed. Only now does it seem unfair because Israel is so much more succesful of a country. A Palestinian state could have been a success but their own actions prevented it, not Israel's. Today Israel has more than twice as many muslims as existed there before, and the descendents of refugees have exploded to 10 million so it's ridiculous to ask for right of return. I don't think they should have accepted any muslim citizens at all. Both sides would prefer to be seperate, it doesn't work well to live in a country with an ideology so distinct from your own. If everyone was reasonable there should be no need for seperate states anywhere in the world, but that is not the case so ethnic cleansing is a good way to ensure your state will conform to your own values. Democracy does not work with muslims.

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","Haha, no not at all. Hence the reason I said, ""But of course, these are all just fairy tales anyway."" After watching Cosmos and reading a few science books, you really start to see the silliness in all of it. Suddenly none of what you believed makes sense and all the scientific stuff does. It's a big faith shaker for sure.

I know I sound a little extreme. I don't feel that way anymore, but I needed that anger/passion to break away from it all back in the day.

As far as demons/evil spirits/etc. are concerned. I had a few ""demonic experiences"" myself as a child. One, for example, was when I had a video game and it had ghosts in it. I was like 12. It bothered my conscience but I held onto the game anyway. As a child, I was (a very real) terrified of demons so of course my mind would play tricks on me all the time, I can see that now. Anyway, I woke up from a bad nightmare about ghosts and I could feel something pushing down on me, crushing me, I couldn't move! I was terrified and began to scream, ""JEHOVAH, JEHOVAH!"" and soon the feeling subsided. I knew that demons were real at that point and that, for me, confirmed that Jehovah was too! I threw the game in a dumpster that was blocks away from my house and the problem never happened again. It was for sure a demon pushing down on me, though! I knew it! I felt it! IT WAS REAL!

And now for the ""M.Night Shyamalan"" twist! I was so, so, so young and stupid. What actually was happening was [this](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis). Turns out I was full of shit. You see, there is always an explanation, you just have to look for it. I can't really blame myself for those crazy beliefs though because I was so young, but everything makes sense now, scientific sense.

When you believe something, your mind will provide confirmation bias EVERYWHERE to support your belief, silly though it may be. That experience is a great example of how my belief system had taken over my rational thought process and confirmed the bias I already had in thinking that ""evil spirits"" existed.

Like I said before, JW's are ""sheep"" and like the easy way. Just believe in demons/Satan and you have an easy explanation for all the weird stuff and bad stuff that happens to you! But it takes a little more effort to research Psychology books and the like to find out how great our minds are at fucking with us.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","Well, I came up with a theory for the ridiculousness of the duels a while ago. When you realize that in TPM, Obi-Wan is a padawan, and Qui-Gon is an old, exhausted man, they logically were not the best acrobats or swordsmen in the world at that point (which is why Qui-Gon dies and Obi-Wan gets the shit kicked out of him at first). However, in the next movie, Kenobi has progressed, and Anakin is quickly becoming one of the best swordsmen in the galaxy (he *is* the chosen one, after all), yet they're both beaten by Dooku, who's practically done nothing with his life since leaving the Jedi except train for duels and become more powerful in the dark side. Yoda's fight is ridiculous though, just because he's fly like that. The fights in *Revenge* are so much more ramped up because Anakin and Obi-Wan have become more-or-less the best two swordsmen in the galaxy, Grievous is a killing machine trained by Dooku, Mace Windu's a Bad Ass Mother Fucker, and Palpatine has finally come onto the dueling scene.

Just my thoughts, though.

Because in Asylum, it was new. In City, you're used to it. The fact remains that without certain gadgets, areas in both games are impossible to get to. It's a good progression method. Zelda does it all the time.

Assuming you live to [the average American life expectancy](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=life+expectancy+American) of 78.21 years, that's 8.99 × 10^16 orgasms a year, which is 2.461 × 10^14 per day, 1.026 × 10^13 per hour, 1.709×10^11 per minute, or 2.849×10^9 (in other words, over 2.8 *trillion*) orgasms per second.

"homebrew","t5_2qw5k","Biggest mistake new recipe creaters make: Overkill on the specialty grains.  Lesson 1: You can make great beer from base malt alone

Lesson 2: look at recipes you've used and like.  Calculate the ratio of the speciality grains they used in relation to the total grain bill. Recognize how much of what they put in.

Lesson 3:  Read up on what each grain adds.  Different malts may add flavor, body, head retention, aroma, etc, etc.  Think about what you want in your final beer. 

Lesson 4: Don't get so caught up in the recipe that you brew sloppy.  Always brew clean and anything that gets near your beer is properly sanitized.

Lesson 5: Pitch adequate yeast populations.  Do not underpitch (or let it go through uncontrolled temperature fluctuations during fermentation) or it won't matter what your recipe was!

Program and length of time lifting?


In general, for lifters who are beyond their 'noob' gains eating below a calorie deficit to lose weight and gaining muscle are contradictory goals. You are still young and if you are new to lifting, say this is your first year or so, you can reasonably expect to lower your body fat percent while gaining muscle mass. 5-7lbs isn't too lofty of a goal. 1-2lbs of fat loss a weak is achievable unless you have single digit body fat in my experience. This is all very vague and somewhat optimistic. I apologize but would need to know more about your status as a lifter before I could tell you anything more specific.


That being said, there are several 'calorie calculators' out there than can help you determine how much you should be eating to lose those lbs in your time frame.
    

I like this website's calculators:
http://www.freedieting.com/tools/weight_loss_calculator.htm
http://www.freedieting.com/tools/calorie_calculator.htm

    
When using the second one it will be far more accurate if you know your bf%
   
 
The take away is you will need an 800-1000 calorie a day deficit to achieve your goal. It's rather hard to jump straight to that. Your body will not enjoy that drastic of a change if you tomorrow decided to go for extreme fat loss. If you lower your daily calorie intake by steps of -250/day a week its a smoother transition.



Example for 5' 10"" 160 lb male age 19 5 day a week exercise:

* Week 1 2307 calories, estimated week's weight loss 0.5 lb
* Week 2 2057 calories, estimated week's weight loss 1.0 lb
* Week 3 1807 calories, estimated week's weight loss 1.5 lb
* Week 4 1557 calories, estimated week's weight loss 2.0 lb
    Total weight lost- 5lbs in 4 weeks
    

This is an easily manageable diet and transition that should theoretically get you the results you are interested in if you pay attention to your calories and stick to the diet and exercise regime. After the 4 weeks are up I suggest recalculating with your new bf% and body weight to determine your new maintenance calories (the amount you need to neither gain nor lose weight) and weekly in +250 calorie steps work your way back to it. It is likely at 1000 calorie deficit that some of the weight you will be losing will be from muscle mass. This undesirable of course by unavoidable for the degree of fat loss you are interested in.","1322697893"

&gt; A gnostic approach: The god of the Old Testament was a demon in disguise (this would explain all the killings, the genocides, the flood, etc.); Jesus came to the world to dethrone this false God.

Or this, for that matter:

&gt; Generic God: Suppose there is a God in heaven, who created the universe and listens to your prayers, but who did NOT inspire the Bible. All of it is fake.

Although, that always makes me feel arrogant about prayers.

This is convenient because it divides evenly as an integer down to a quarter, and eighths are 3.5g which is still easy to measure with a cheap digital scale.  Grams are really the base unit in all cases; for some reason, us Americans decided to measure things in grams but sometimes label them with ounces.

Pot and coke are exactly the same in this regard.  Both are commonly measured and priced by the gram, or by the fake drug ounce that is rounded so that it can be measured in grams.  If someone sells you an ounce of any drug, they're almost certainly weighing out 28.0 grams (unless they short you, of course).

Pretty much, I'm just reiterating the other replies to your comment.

Realistically, no one is going to put a noob paramedic *in charge* of anything. If you're in a system that works paramedics, they're going to have a lot of paramedics who are more experienced around to supervise the newer ones and keep them in line. So it goes with EMS and pretty much any other line of work in the world.

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt;So working within your frame work. What percentage of the world's population shares that particular trait with the Palestinians and cannot have their children classed as refugees?

I have no idea because that's completely irrelevant. The UNHCR definition was not created in some attempt to exclude Palestinians. It's a completely neutral definition. A refugee is someone who has nationality in a country but can't enter said country or a refugee is someone who lived on a certain piece of land but can't return to this land. Most of the Palestinian refugees simply don't meet that definition. That's all there is to it. Asking for statistics about other refugees is a red herring. Anyone who meets the UNHCR definition is a refugee. Anyone who doesn't isn't one. It's that simple.

&gt;In addition what do you call the children of these people.

I can see how you could argue that selling someone a drug they use to eradicate their own free will is harmful to them, but taking those sellers and locking them in a cage is most certainly and undeniably a violation of *their* free will.

Regarding the black market, there's nobody who's addicted to hiring people to commit murder. Having a drug like meth be a black market commodity only raises prices, endangers addicts and isolates them from society. You wouldn't keep anyone away from meth but you'd hurt meth addicts more while enriching the dealers who rely on prohibition to maintain high prices.","1322697933"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Long time lurker here just registered today after reading all the feedback in this thread so that I can give a big shout out to an android Reddit browser called ‘Reddit News’. 

My awesome bf is the independent developer and he’s spent a lot of time focussing on making the user experience as smooth and intuitive as possible. 

Frustratingly, the number of installs doesn’t seem to reflect just how good this GUI is for its intended purpose and market!

I use it daily and love it but here’s a selection of some of the independent review comments: “Excellent Easily the best Reddit app available”, “Quality app with a great UI. Best app for Reddit.”, “Best reddit app yet :D Love the way comments are hidden beneath links with just a swipe.”, “This just gets better This app just keeps improving. Totally worth the price!”, “awesome best Reddit phone app. believe me, I tried them all”, “Excellent. I've been using the application for about a day and I can say this is without question the best Reddit application floating around.”, “Great Best Reddit app! Took me a bit to figure out how to go to comments, but that is because I was use to another app. The GUI is actually very intuitive!”, “Awesome This is by far the best reddit client I've found. The user interface is so advanced it feels like it's running on ICS!”, “Getting closer to being the Android equivalent of alien blue!”, and my personal favourite “My wife hates this app. It is fantastic. Goodbye sleep.” 

(Haha, I know how she feels except my bf is up ‘til all hours on the development side of things!!).

Anyway, I hope I’ve made a good case for getting you to at least have a look at Reddit News (free version with adds or paid without) because it hasn’t had a lot of exposure yet. I sincerely predict most will really like it and no doubt  it would be really rewarding to see it gain good momentum in the market. Tanks for listening in!

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","Oh contraire! Even on this subreddit I have already gotten several insinuations and a few direct comments that I will ""transition eventually"" when I am discussing my situation (bigender, it seems). 

I seem to notice the ""trans enough"" thing not so much in the context of people thinking they are better than someone else because they are ""more trans"" (that isn't very PC, and asktransgender is nothing if not PC. I find very little offensive language here), but more in the context of thinking that ""full trans"" is an ideal to which all gender confused individuals must/will aspire.

I know none of them mean any disrespect, and I don't take any such comments as such, I am just pointing it out because it seems relevant to this ""trans enough"" theory. 

I have said it before and will say it again, I think Western society has a love affair with binaries (black-white, male-female, cis-trans, gay-straight, etc.) and even for those whose lives do not fit in with socially prescribed binaries (see everyone on this subreddit ^-^), it is incredibly difficult to fully eradicate their alluring effect. Binaries are a simple concept to comprehend, after all! I, for one, fall into it ALL the time! &gt;.&lt;

The Netherlands and Belgium are just as crowded as Japan or Taiwan, but nobody says Japan or Taiwan will solve this RACE problem by bringing in millions of third worlders and quote assimilating unquote with them.

Everybody says the final solution to this RACE problem is for EVERY white country and ONLY white countries to “assimilate,” i.e., intermarry, with all those non-whites.

What if I said there was this RACE problem and this RACE problem would be solved only if hundreds of millions of non-blacks were brought into EVERY black country and ONLY into black countries?

How long would it take anyone to realize I’m not talking about a RACE problem. I am talking about the final solution to the BLACK problem?

And how long would it take any sane black man to notice this and what kind of psycho black man wouldn’t object to this?

But if I tell that obvious truth about the ongoing program of genocide against my race, the white race, Liberals and respectable conservatives agree that I am a naziwhowantstokillsixmillionjews.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","&gt; Q: Why have you forgiven your mother and not your father? A: Mom and I have always been best friends, and always were able to work through things, even if we squabbled. We spent so much time together. She gave up her career to raise me, a special needs baby, and guided me into college classes at age 15, and scholarships like the Coca-Cola Scholarship. Without her I don't know if I'd be this far. When I showed her the video, she was horrified. She was broken. She cried and stammered apologies to me for three days. When Dad saw the video, he didn't think anything of it.

At the start of the video, your mother says, ""I've already spanked her,"" or something similar.  Please explain that.  Do you have that on video?

Other bottled water was found to be less regulated than tap water in terms of contaminants, and oftentimes more polluted with toxins than regular tap water. Another factor, aside from the shady lack of information coming from the industry regarding bottled water, is the presence of bisphenol A in plastic bottled water.""

"gaming","t5_2qh03","So there are a few ways you could do this, but I'll describe the way that would best work with your MacBook Pro. This way will maintain your ability to play games normally while not getting an overly complicated setup.
Basically you'll need a [tristar gameplay recorder](http://www.newelectronx.com/proddetail.php?prod=tristar-mx-dvr): 
No software, codecs, or annoying drivers are necessary for this option.
You would basically run the output from the game system into the tristar gamplay recorder, have the go to your TV from the tristar gameplay recorder.
Insert a usb flash drive into the tristar mx pvr. I'm sure you have some laying around the house. If not, just record directly onto the internal hard drive of the tristar game recorder.
Now if you want to edit the gameplay that you have just recorded then use the usb cable to connect the tristar directly to the mac book pro. The mac book pro will connect to the tristar without any drivers and allow you to access the internal drive content of the tristar hdpvr. From here you can take the things (video gameplay, music, movies, photos) off the tristar or place things onto it. Or you can just remove the usb drive from the tristar hdpvr and place it into your mac book pro. either way, it will work.
That is the way it works for me, hope you can find some hope in what i described.","1322697950"

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;your coursework was way fucking harder.

Well, I'll just let you say it.  I can't draw that conclusion.  I didn't take her curriculum.  I assume my curriculum was easier for me than it would have been for her.  I also assume her curriculum was easier for her than it would have been for me, except for the few math and science classes that were required for her general education requirements.  

Unfortunately, I think there's a perversion in our higher education system that puts pressure on arts and humanities departments to treat all opinions as equally valid and let students slide by with A's or B's for just reading and sharing opinions versus critically thinking about issues and themes in those readings.  Herbert Prochnow said, ""A great many people mistake opinions for thoughts.""  My intuition says that math, science, and engineering departments applied the pressure, perhaps subtly, to lower the bar in arts and humanities programs to ensure their scientists and engineers weren't getting on academic probation for failing an ethics or composition course.  Admittedly, I'm speculating as to the cause, but the result, as you say, is that ""all I had to do was read and share my opinion which was never wrong.""  I wonder what you learned from that experience.  Maybe a great deal.  I hope so.

Anywho, I think we're going to have to agree to disagree here.  I appreciate your engaging, though.  Let me pass along a great article I read about a year ago.  It's *[Dehumanized:  When Math and Science Rule the School](http://harpers.org/archive/2009/09/0082640)* by Mark Slouka for Harper's.  He argues that the arts and humanities have largely lost out to math and science, mostly because knowledge gained in the study of arts and humanities is difficult to directly translate into a commodity.  He also argues this devaluation of the arts and humanities is undermining democracy.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Hey there, I can only partially answer this for you. I currently work at Zappos, for a little over two years now in our web development team. Obviously I did not take the deal, but someone in my training class did. I can attest that it's legit, and there's no strings attached to the money, but it isn't really offered the day they say ""Ok you're hired!"". It's a little hard to explain, so here's my somewhat vague response to our hiring process:

When you apply, and you're contacted by our recruiting team, depending on what department you applied for, they'll have you take some tests. Some of them are phone calls, others are interviews. In my case, I had a culture phone call, and a culture/technical interview that took about 8 hours. I was at the Zappos campus all day. It sounds horrible, but I got to hang out with the department I applied for, they took me out to lunch, we chatted it up. It was quite nice. After the interview, I got an offer a few days after that. I responded and they set up my first work day. After arriving, you have a few days before you're whisked into CLT Training. CLT is short for ""Customer Loyalty Team"", which are the folks that WOW you whenever you call :) (or at least try!) You're probably saying ""Wait...why would you have to take this course if you're a developer?"" Everyone takes this course, whether you're a developer, CLT, Finance, Human Resources, or a CTO. Tony (The CEO) even re-takes the course from time to time. When holiday season comes up, everyone in the company helps out our CLT by spending some time on the phones, whether it's your actual job or not. This helps take the load off CLT considerably. And because we all took the course, we know how to work the internal systems, and how we can try and WOW people who call in. Taking this course also gives you a level of appreciation of how hard our CLT team works. That no matter how much of an ""uber leet programmer"" you are, you're no more hardworking than our CLT team. It's quite a humbling experience.

You spend a month in the course, taking phone calls, learning our backend system, and getting a huge culture injection and all that surreal stuff. At the end of this month, you are offered to take the deal of $3000 (it was $2000 when I took the class) and leave, or to stay at Zappos and pursue further growth and learning. This is really to get people to ask themselves ""Is Zappos the right for me?"". And it's totally cool if you take the money. Zappos is definitely NOT for everybody. If you're the kind of person that is easily frustrated when a [sudden nerf war explodes from out of nowhere](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FS4behRquIk), then it's probably not your most desired workplace. So the money is kind of a way of saying ""Thanks for letting us have you for a month (which is paid btw), were sorry Zappos wasn't the place for you after all.""

I don't really speak for everyone who took the money. But it would be cool to hear people who have :)","1322697955"

The relevant quotation (Bold is my emphasis):
&gt;From ancient times down to the present, there is found among various peoples a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers over the course of things and over the events of human history; at times some indeed have come to the recognition of a Supreme Being, or even of a Father. This perception and recognition penetrates their lives with a profound religious sense.

&gt;Religions, however, that are bound up with an advanced culture have struggled to answer the same questions by means of more refined concepts and a more developed language. Thus in Hinduism, men contemplate the divine mystery and express it through an inexhaustible abundance of myths and through searching philosophical inquiry. They seek freedom from the anguish of our human condition either through ascetical practices or profound meditation or a flight to God with love and trust. Again, Buddhism, in its various forms, realizes the radical insufficiency of this changeable world; it teaches a way by which men, in a devout and confident spirit, may be able either to acquire the state of perfect liberation, or attain, by their own efforts or through higher help, supreme illumination. Likewise, other religions found everywhere try to counter the restlessness of the human heart, each in its own manner, by proposing ""ways,"" comprising teachings, rules of life, and sacred rites. **The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men.**","1322697957"

However I do 'not' prefer in the long run to have longer and harder instances, it gets tiresome once you know it all but it still takes a long time due to waves and waves of trash or bosses with random mechanics that you can wipe on over and over.

Challenge is fun yes, but a challenge is nothing you should seek for in heroics, they are stepping stones for people to get into LFR, then into regular raids and finally heroic raids where the real challenge lies, especially with the achievements.","1322697964"

Reasons why I went with the 3DS version &gt;&gt; DSi / eShop / Free PC versions:

1) Handheld. Just had a child with my wife and played a lot of this while holding the baby :)

2) I'm on the computer at work all day (...) and do not like to be using a computer in the evening

3) I wanted Home Screen functionality while playing (to check on friends list, use notes feature, etc.); DSi / regular DS games do not allow this

All in all, I felt like it was a great purchase. Can't recommend it to everyone... but for me, as someone who hasn't ever experienced it before, the 3DS version was definitely worth it.","1322697964"

Factory has 3 purposes (always good to extend the purpose of a building), it enables speed upgrade for reapers, allows starport tech, and can build reactor for starport. (and if your boxer you squeeze in hellion drop)

Starport has 2 purposes, medivac, and the solid transition into banshee once the person overmakes ground defence

Medivac has 2 purposes,  healing, and it can pick up reapers and save them from speedling surround and other harassment

The thing that is so impressive about it is, you need high APM for it to pay for itself (but it can REALLY pay for itself) and it needs to be done with perfect timings and amazing tactical decision making.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I'm not sure what you're talking about. You don't have a right to call me anything, if I find what you're calling me offensive? Though I disagree with that. It's not on topic with what we're saying. I'm talking about who's qualified to scrutinize what. I'll admit that no one can decide if someone's offended or not. But people can scrutinize how bigoted something is.

For example: you ask a black friend if he's hungry, and wants to get some fried chicken with you. He gets offended and calls you racist. The two of you call for someone to be an arbitrator, to help settle whether what you said was racist. 

Do you think it's right to exclude a white guy from possibly being the judge in this, simply because of his race? As if he's not qualified to decide whether asking a black guy out for some fried chicken is racist? I think that's a bigoted assumption.

Again, this is still a response to your first comment. I understand that no one can judge what is or isn't offensive, other than the person who is offended. But anyone can judge what is or isn't racist. ""Racist"" and ""offensive"" are not completely synonymous.","1322697979"

Make your thoughts move others the way they move you, but don't be consumed by your words. Here's a random editing job. I won't be offended if you hate it or completely disagree, but sometimes it's easier when someone else does it.




What am I?  
Not the shell of a man you see when the pieces swell to the surface.  
Not the mask of a magician ever-changing, supposition.  
Not outward vibrations, greetings, immutable sensations of hello.  
There's much more than what you see.  
There's a haven inside of me,  
battered emotions.  
rattling shelves of thoughts that have a penchant for madness.  
repressed emotions   
a time bomb ticking to explosion.  
A boil festering waiting to consume after lacerations.  
pulsating surplus of feelings, thoughts, meanings; it sits neglected.  

When you sit in bed  
Do you think of the sadness?  
That time he threatened to leave and you said don't go please  
so he hit you and walked through the hole in your heart  
and out the door?  
Do you remember your father?  
Do you even bother?  
You shouldn't.  
Because repression is the key.  
Madness is serene.  

Explosions of emotions happen only in your dreams,  
So keep them bottled up, let that pile of feelings reach the roof of reason.  
Let them call you out for treason  
Rattle bars of cages in the back of your skull.  
Thoughts and meanings sentenced to solitary  
Smiling façade functional ordinary.  
Lockdown like they're on the back of a bull.  
The fear of falling, of being loosed, should contain them.  
Shrug off your emotions until you’re bare and unhealthy.  
Remember the feeling of being open comforts less than insanity.  
Because who really knows what I am anymore?  
Have I ever told you what my thoughts were before?  
Did I mean it? Or was I just placating monster called conversation?  

all I am is a gray cobweb of illusion  
Sprawled out between those who've enjoyed the delusion  
An open grave.  
The marbled marker reads: fun guy.  
A mushroom,  
A flower that didn't bloom.  
But I can hide that from you with the strength of an army invasion.  
I can paint the landscape of my mind with false emotion  
So what am I?  
a cardboard box, which aches to be undone,  
For its components to be unstrung  
One day, you'll see the world.  
And you'll meet it and greet it with your arms glued to your hips.  

Depression over that time you remembered you were mortal.  
Anger at the thing that had led you to the cliff and then pushed you.  
Regret at the fact that you didn't spend more time with that thing before you flew  
From the peak of happiness into a canyon of crazy.  
This enigma of exotic sensations and mental contortions,  
This cacophony of nature that resides in your mind,  
The singular sound blaring like a siren in your ears at dark,  
It’s itemized madness filed for a taxed life.  

It's the feeling of a burden consuming your mind.  
It's the feeling of insanity crawling in from behind.  
And when you feel it you'll understand why  
Why I am just a remainder of the things that men did.

One morning the whole team is riding the school bus to a Saturday invitational. We're only like halfway to the meet, and naturally I have to take a piss. Since I was used to this, I held it for a while. Then I held it some more. And some more. But we still weren't at the meet yet...

It feels like my abdomen is going to explode, and I don't know how much longer I can make it. I have no way out, no where to piss without exposing myself to dozens of my co-ed teammates. *Finally* the bus arrives in the parking lot, and the driver lets us out without parking first (thank God).

So I *walk* (not run) because if I move any faster I might explode/collapse. I go to the school bathrooms, and sweet Jesus, I have the best piss of my life. I must've stood at that urinal for like 4 minutes. Other dudes would walk up to the adjacent urinal, piss, and walk away and I was still pissing. But such a close call though.

**TL;DR** Had the worst urge to piss ever on a school bus to a cross country meet. Made it to the restroom just in time, must've pissed for like 4 minutes.","1322697987"

One thing I would agree with is that most of the time, this isn't something one should worry about when deciding whether to smoke pot or not. However, I just wanted to further educate you on the link between marijuana.","1322697996"

I loved Bastion too, but they were published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment (I'm not sure if that still counts as being indie even though WB only published it).

Wizorb was pretty unique and I really liked how they ""re-imagined"" the old school retro Breakout-clone.

Frozen Synapse was a great game (hard to master though), but I had plenty of fun with it. Great soundtrack too.

Other games which should be mentioned: Jamestown, Magicka, Atom Zombie Smasher and To the Moon.

I absolutely agree with everything you've said. I understand that language changes, and I am in no way demanding such adherence. 

I'm simply saying that there is a right and wrong way to use that phrase--that it has an inherent definition in its context, and that most people using the phrase want to use it in such a context (debate, argument, proving apoint), but are doing so incorrectly. Yes, I understand what you're saying, but no, you're not using it as it was intended.

The same is true of the usage of the word ""irony"". We rarely use it as it was intended, and it has taken on a new meaning in popular usage. I understand what is meant when people call something ""ironic"", and I use it in a similar fashion, but I will acknowledge that I am using it wrong.","1322697998"

As my father died 10 years ago and never got the chance to meet my husband, it means so much to me that part of my ring was chosen by my father and the other part by my husband. In fact, I didn't actually see the ring til he put it on my finger at the wedding. He asked if I minded if he designed it and surprised me with it. I'm a sucker for originality.

Boston is one of my absolute favorite cities in the country, and if you like history just walking around the older parts of the city is an amazing experience in and of itself.

  I did some research on the cost of repairs, and since the repairs were for work I didn't pay cash (sometimes you can do this to get a discount), but they replaced a broken screen, and replaced a busted keyboard for about $50-$75 cheaper then other places.

They were 100% professional with me, gave me a ticket with the order number, and gave me a call when the repairs were complete. In my opinion they did excellent work at a good price.  
  Why not give them a call and see if they can do what you need?","1322698011"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'd like to see you explain this, merely for my own amusement. 

I'll take a crack at the obvious points, mainly Noah's Arc, and the Garden of Eden.

First off, no clear thinking, educated Christian person believes either story to be true in the way the Bible describes. 

Noah's Arc's tale of a boat full of two of every animal is preposterous. We know it, you know it. *HOWEVER*, there is evidence that at one time thousands of years ago, the Straight of Gibraltar was a solid wall, and the Mediterranean Sea was dry. During Earth's formative years following the Ice Age, this was one of the few hospitable places on Earth were early human could survive. 

As evidence suggests, the Straight broke dramatically (over the course of a lifetime, which is pretty fucking fast). Such a flood of the lowlands would be stunning to primitive man, and human kind would attribute this to the wrath of god. 

Now a days, we are aware of the geological history of the region, and the Catholic Church uses the tale of Noah's Arc as a teaching tool, not fact.

Next, the Garden of Eden. Nowhere in the Bible does it suggest that the Garden of Eden was a specific place on the Earth, so it could be argued that the Garden of Eden WAS the Earth, but humankind had no sin. No Catholic really believes in the snake and the fruit, either. We take it as metaphors. Again, a teaching tool.

Honestly, there's nothing in science that disprove any of Catholic's (and Christian) beliefs. The things in the Bible that *are* disputed by science, the Catholic Church sides with science. We still teach what's in the Bible, but it's all used as methods to get the message across.

I've been going to a Catholic church all my life, and I have never met anyone who is a young-Earth believer, anyone who believes that the Garden of Eden and Noah's Arc were real, or anyone who argues against anything science has discovered.","1322698015"

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Firstly, your benchmarks are ""estimates"" given by ARM for the chip at the heart of each of these processors. Not only could ARM's numbers be inaccurate, but Samsung and Nivida put a lot of customization into the designs after getting them from ARM. That's why the Apple A5 (based on the A9) is so much faster than the Exynos 4210 in the SGS2 (also based on the A9). 

Its likely that Samsung (or Nvidia) could underclock the chip to meet power requirements. Or, they could customize it to get more performance. The ""A9"" or ""A15"" aspect is just a base-point. You cant look at the benchmarks for the base-point and assume it will be indicative of the final product.

But beyond looking at that; this Exynos isn't even out yet. The Kal-El hasn't been fully tested yet. You're assuming the Exynos will be paired with certain graphics chips which aren't even out yet. The only concrete numbers we have are the 7.2 GFLOPs for the Tegra, and that's only for graphics performance.

Also: Tegra is more than just a chip. Its a gaming platform. With Tegra Zone, Nvidia provides resources to help developers optimize their games for the platform. Samsung has never done anything like this, and probably wont. Its possible that even if the Exynos 5250 is technically better than Kal-El (which you can't conclude at this point), games and applications could still run better on Kal-El because Nvidia is more than a chip company; they're a software company.

Finally, the Exynos 5250 wont be released until Q2 2012. Kal-El is in consumer devices today. Kal-El's successor (Wayne/Grey) is due to be released around the same time as the Exynos 5250 (Q2 2012); if we're gonna make comparisons, do it between those two. And here's what we know about Wayne thus far:

* Based on the ARM Cortex A15 MPCore
* 24 nm process (smaller than the Exynos 5250)
* 4 or 8 core CPU
* 24 (4-core CPU) or 32/64 (8-core CPU) GPU cores
* ""Roughly twice as fast as Kal-El""
* The second iteration (""Grey"") will have on-die Icera LTE, for phones at least.

Now, if we're comparing Apples to Apples, then Wayne sounds much faster than the Exynos 5250. But again, its unfair to compare either of them because all we have is glorified press reports from the manufacturers about their performance. So I think we should wait a bit on the crazy number crunching and DMIPS until we get the actual silicon in devices on the shelves.","1322698023"

How far will people go to save a few bucks on crap we don't even need? It does help the economy and I'm all for that but it goes overboard at times. I've worked during this event many times and even been to shop myself through all the chaos. I just wish people would take our movement on Wall Street and other places that follow it more seriously. We are the 99% and we do have a right to say and act as we see fit. This is America, we elect the leaders, we put them into office and we have the power. These bastards can't dictate our lives.

It's argued that individuals with AIDS take ART regularly, and properly even in the poorest of nations. This is much more involved than getting an injection, or even multiple injections, yet people adhere. In no way is condom use akin to an injection. Also, condom use is highest (in Sub-Sarharan Africa) when women  report having more of a say in sexual practices - the lack of use in many cases is a sign of the unequal statuses of women. Ultimately, in the world we live in condom's aren't preventative enough. They're last ditch efforts during the most heated of moments. Focus on condoms as prevention puts the power only in the hands of men  and ignores the remaining 50% of the population (note that female condoms are not widely available and much more expensive than male condoms).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","There is no simple, clear definition because there is a debate among historians which phenomena can be summarized by the term fascism. 

If you want a very strict definition then fascism is a social and political movement in Italy, during the 1920 to the 1940. 

In a broader sense fascism is a view on society that is obsessed with its current decline and 'fall' from its supposedly glorious previous state. Fragmentation, dissent, weakness are the terms used to characterize the present society. From this gloomy perspective, fascism emphasizes values like strengt, unity, youthfulness, purity and so on to return to the supposed glory of the past.

The main 'operating frame' of fascism is NOT necessarily the state or the government since many movements that can be labeled as fascist explicitely fought against the political structures of their time (states, governments, etc.).

Fascism therefore operates rather within the frame of race or nation, since these frames allow for a 'mythical', 'legendary' past which can provice the canvas for their worldview of decline, decadence and decay and their subsequent call for renewal/rebirth. Elitist aspects are important here: the belief that this nation or race or culture is for whatever reason better that any of the other nations, races or cultures. 

Fascism is not at first simply an authoritarian goverment but rather a movement that operates bottom-up, with a large base of people from lower classes. Once in power, this movement is of course authoritarian.

You could say that fascism is the desparate trial to get back to a state of society before modernity where several authorities (church, state, tradition etc.) guaranteed certain truths and your place within society. The challenge of modernity, that making ""sense"" (of your actions, your life, the world) is delegated to the individual , is what fascism tries to reverse by providing 'truth' and 'sense'. It has proven to be a very powerful idea, especially for the poor and uneducated. This is what makes it so dangerous. ","1322698033"

But as to any other risk...there is always risk.  Any time any person is alone with any other person there is risk of one of those people doing something horrible.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","Yup. That's why Evas exists. :) Been doing hardware compositing and rendering via OpenGL for god knows how long now. started with that back in 2001. It was crufty and IFFY then. I gave Xrender a shot for many years and gave up this year - engine deprecated.

Cross-platform support isn't that great (ie windows or OSX - OSX is better though as it's still unixy and has an xserver and opengl), but that's not really the goal, the goal was to give a higher level scene graph api that then sat right on top of an engine you can redirect to anything with as much acceleration as possible. pure software (last i checked it was beating pixman by between 30-100% for alpha blending -  thus cairo etc.), opengl, at one time cairo and xrender, still directfb, and others.

as you get to optimize immediate mode drawing away from the app, it tends to make up for ""bad app drawing code"" a lot. if you do know how to make it draw well, then it's another thing you don't have to worry about in your app.

it doesn't force widgets on you - it's the scene graph. it doesn't even force a mainloop and event system on you if you just use raw evas. you can grab those from other EFL libs that layer on top of sit alongside.","1322698034"

You might end up getting more for your money if you go AMD on the processor. Right now, your processor is a little bit overpowered for your whole build. You could spend that savings on a little bit higher-quality motherboard.

You also might want to consider an ATX motherboard rather than an mATX motherboard. In a mid-tower case, the mATX ends up looking a little small, and there's more room for stuff on an ATX.

As others have said, you definitely want to get a different HD, preferably 7200RPM, and you can get some RAM ([this DDR3-1333 is cheaper and a pretty f'in good deal today](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820231426&amp;cm_sp=Cat_Memory-_-Daily_Deal-_-20-231-426)), the one you have listed is not compatible with the motherboard you listed. You do want to make sure that there's enough room on the board for your RAM and your CPU, but usually it's not an issue, as you can just move it over to the other slots.

Otherwise, looks like a good cheap budget build.","1322698034"

He only talks about the flaws of a game, instead of the good aspects. I agree with the flaws he mentioned, but he didn't even once mention that the world of Skyrim itself is fucking beautiful. There's so much more to Skyrim than he lets on, the way he describes it is a big bugfest with some dungeons. Has he ever outright said he likes a game?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When we knocked down and re-developed a property my parents owned we (realised after plans were drawn) that at one point the neighbors cemented driveway encroached 6 inches onto our property. Because this driveway was &gt; 20 years old the land technically belonged to our neighbors. Now 6"" doesn't sound like much, but if we wanted a straight wall we had to move the whole side of the building 6 inches's in. We had 2 options:

1-Curve the wall to fit the cemeneted driveway

2-Ask the neighbors permission if they could give us back the old straight line and have the cement cut.

Now as this property was kinda expensive I was really worried that they would say no and we would be forced to give up 6 inches of our property (building a curved wall really wasn't an option). Stressed for about a week, then thought fuck it and just got a cement cutter to come in at around 9pm and just cut the overlapping bits of cement without telling them a thing. Got away with it.","1322698063"

That being said, I still see your argument as committing an appeal to authority/tradition (life extension shouldn't be given to criminals because the law says that criminals lose certain things other citizens get)  combined with an unexplained reason as to why life extension is one of the things that people should lose after a conviction. You haven't even touched my point I made somewhere in the thread about the possibility of a wrong conviction. 

As far as competition, this is already occurring.People die every day from a lack of resources while other people take in more than their share. Competition is the basis of capitalism and the economy of the US. I also think it's illegitimate to claim that since it's possible for people to deplete all natural resources that denying someone else years of a life is ethical (hell, if we all switched to a vegan diet, we could create a huge amount of food that is currently going to the horror of factory farming of animals). 

May I ask for your opinion on the death penalty?

I also think everyone should be entitled to health, no matter what. Within the context of law, I'm entitled to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That aside, a world where everyone denies each other health is a world in where no life exists.","1322698065"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","One thing that helps me, similar to the thing the monk said, is that there are 2 kinds of buddhist practice: devotional practice and transformative practice. The thing you seem to object to is devotional practice, which occurs in every single buddhist-influenced place. Perhaps this is what looks like people venerating buddha as a god. Transformative buddhism requires digging deeper into the teachings and not every buddhist does this. In various places influenced by buddhism, there was a way to allow both,  in that those who were devotional could come to the temples and make offerings and give to the monks/nuns in support of their practice-- and the monks/nuns were to practice and transform and help all beings, including those who were following ""only"" a devotional way. Humans from our earliest evolution have always believed in the supernatural and practiced devotionally toward those entitites imagined to be in control where human control was so pitifully small. What the buddha offered was something that surpasses the name and form of devotional practice and which allows the practitioner to transform his/her entire relationship to the human condition. Not every person does this. That will never change.","1322698069"

What I mean is, take an aspect of soloing that challenges you, then focus only on that.

For example, if you tend to avoid hammer-ons, compose some licks using as many hammer-ons as possible. If alternate picking is difficult for you, try coming up with an alternate picking drill. 

Another good practice technique is to write solos. Take a section of music you'd like to solo over, and write something.

I have no problem with international movement of goods, as long as international movement of people and ideas is also allowed.  Anarcho-syndicalists are the most anti-border people imaginable. 

You claim that ""free trade"" helps nations develop.  This is a common myth with no basis in reality.  The nations that have successfully developed in the past few decades, most impressively Japan, China, South Korea, and the smaller Asian tigers, all did so by ignoring the rules of ""free trade"" and instituted high tariffs, state owned enterprises, infant industry protection, subsidies for high tech industry, currency manipulation, etc.  The US and Western Europe did similar things during our development.  (The USA had the highest tariffs in the world during our period of industrialization in the nineteenth century).

Actual existing capitalism currently allows the free movement of capital without the free movement of people and information.  To the extent that nations follow the neoliberal program, the result is a race to the bottom.  The nations that have had ""free trade and free markets"" imposed on them, namely the sub-Saharan African nations, have seen no growth over the past several decades.","1322698076"

Then everybody who may not have a SO has the chance to still receive something from somebody that shows they're appreciated and thought about. It's a little bit later than right after New Year's but I know that for me, it would definitely be best to do something a few weeks after the holiday season is over so that way I can refill my bank account to a decent amount before spending, yet again. Or, you know, maybe it doesn't have to be for Valentine's Day, just somewhere in that mid-Jan to mid-Feb time span.

As for the international shipping, maybe create different hosting sites for those in Canada, USA, Europe who can't afford international shipping and then one other site where people can sign up if international shipping isn't a problem. It's a lot of extra work... but the only other solution I can think of is to have a type of form that indicates either willing to ship internationally, not willing to ship internationally, etc. and then having somebody comb through veryyy carefully to match people up. It's more matching work rather than site hosting work but it seems that the multiple sites would help prevent matching mistakes.

I think $15-$20 is a great range. Although, I know that in RL the maximums are commonly ignored because people get really excited when buying products, so possibly make a $10 minimum with a $15-$20 maximum (some lee-way). I'm not sure, it's just me picking at minute details.

As for the themes... I think a lot of things could work. Winter, Pick-me-up, Health, Beauty, Stress relief (such as, something to take your mind off of classes/work), Self-Appreciation (items to make you feel good about yourself?), etc.","1322698085"

**Prefuse 73: Prefuse73 Plays the Books** (great band. brought an all time fav album back to life for me)

**Fog: Ether Teeth** (more lo-fi, has a unique voice, not for everyone)

**The Microphones: The Glow pt.2** (again lo-fi, lots of variance with this band. another old favorite)

**Skalpel: Sculpture** (Jazzy turntable-ism. If i remember the album Polish Jazz was pretty good too?)

**Kid Koala: Some of my best friends are DJs** (more turntable-ism)

**The Avalanches: Since I Left You** (more DJ centric, but not really turntable based)

I know I'm getting pretty far off course, but like I said, there's not a lot out there that sounds like The Books. If anyone else would like to chime in, I'd looove to be proven wrong and get some new music.


You might also like my buddy's project Plant Magic Man (more modern, kind of Animal Collective-e)


But yeah bud, that's all I have off the top of my head while I'm away from my collection. It's been a long time since I've listened to a lot of this music regularly, so I hope my minds ear isn't too far off ;)

Yes, they view Iran as a threat and do support military action against them- I have no doubt in that either.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm sure this will get buried in this pro-Catholic circlejerk, but I'm sick of hearing how supposedly pro-science the Catholic church is. As with any religion, the Catholic church is only pro-science to the extent that it doesn't conflict with their dogma. The Catholic church is better than other Christian denominations in that it tries to be more pro-science to avoid public relations problems with denying scientific findings. Anyway, we shouldn't be patting people on the back for acknowledging basic science; it should be the default position.

Regarding evolution specifically, Catholics believe in theistic evolution, which is not really evolution in my opinion. They believe God drove evolution with humans as an end goal. The scientific theory of evolution has absolutely no goal in the process. Whatever survives and procreates from random mutations and fortunate external circumstances thrives. To claim that God controls these mutations or set the ball rolling is a clear god of the gaps argument. [Catholics also believe in monogenism](http://www.catholic.com/tracts/adam-eve-and-evolution) - that all modern humans descended from one pair of human ancestors - because it is required for original sin to make sense. The scientific consensus is that we came from a bottleneck of hundreds. A population of only two probably wouldn't survive to spawn a population of seven billion, and if it did, there would be clear DNA evidence.

When you see the pope going around claiming that [condoms will hasten the spread of AIDS](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/cameroon/5007124/Anger-as-Pope-Benedict-XVI-says-condoms-make-Aids-worse.html), it makes it clear that dogma takes priority over reality by a large margin. These are people who believe that talking to a cracker turns it literally into Jesus' flesh. They just make so few real world falsifiable claims now that science doesn't conflict with their dogma often anymore.","1322698099"

No, *your* position is junk. Those studies are peer-reviewed and supported by evidence.

&gt;Any biologists knows the conditions for optimal growing include increased CO2 and warmer weather. 

Actually, plants need a balance of a lot of things to thrive. If you have more heat and more CO2, but not more nutrients or water, plants will die. If you had any knowledge of biology, agronomy and botany (instead of mindlessly repeating the talking points you found on the denier blog), you'd know this.

It's clear that you're suffering from heavy confirmation bias, i.e. you only consider evidence as valid if it agrees with your prior opinion.

&gt;As I said, thats a biased website. 

They admit their biais, and contrary to you they don't let it cloud their judgement.

&gt;They're not using science in a broad sense, they just cherry pick things to try to defeat the skeptics position.

Prove it.

&gt;They ignore anything that contradicts their positions too much.

False, they don't ignore it, they rebut it.

Again, you have been unable to provide any shred of evidence to support your position. As such, you have no credibility on the matter. Zero. Nada. Zilch.

"Darts","t5_2qtyq","It basically comes down to how often you hit what you're aiming for.  If you can hit what you're aiming for it's just strategy, which I differentiate from skill in darts.  The skill levels that I see are:

* hits the board some of the time

* hits the board pretty much all the time with a random distribution

* is usually in the same quarter of the board as what he's aiming for

* clusters around the number he's aiming for and often hits it

* reliably hits the number he's aiming for and often scores doubles or triples

* reliably puts darts in the double or triple of the number he's aiming for

So I would rate yourself on that spectrum (honestly), and that's how good you are.  You can count the number of darts that it takes to finish a game of cricket, but that seems excessive (unless you're just trying to track improvement).

Edit: there are other factors, like precision.  If you're clustering your darts well, but not always at what you aim for, that's good.  That means that your throw is the same every time and it's basically just a matter of calibrating it.","1322698115"

And yes, my entire point was that I'm sure you go with dehum outweighs everything. My explanation was how easy that was to defeat and how it works against you.

If you fiat that your plan takes money from a specific budget, that's extratopical because you can gain advantages from a decrease of money to that budget, and those advantages would be clearly non-resolutional. The phrase ""normal means"" is defined as the way in which the plan as presented would be literally carried out by the USfg/NASA, etc. Obviously you need evidence to indicate how they WOULD carry it out.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","If you genuinely have no idea what runes would be good for jungling then you probably aren't really at a high enough level of play for jungling to be required. 

If you're someone to follow guides, I'd avoid mobafire's and stick to Team solo mid's guides, particularly the ones marked red (usually by TSM members) that have been updated recently. As others have said, practice... Learn one mechanic at a time until you do it automatically. 
For example: At first you want to learn how to last hit minions while staying out of the enemies range/dodging skillshots. Eventually this becomes a process you can do without thinking, then you can work on times when to harass the champ as they move too far past the protection of minions/their tower as you no longer require full focus to hit the minions. You continue this process learning one thing at a time until you've learned all the basic stuff, map awareness and knowing how a jungler will gank you, warding your lane, map control, when to roam, when to push, mental jungle timers, counter jungling, all the nuances of team fighting etc...

After you've gotten all of these down that's when individual skill and playstyle begins to matter. If you tell us your summoner level and your preferred champ role, I'm sure more focused tips will get you started on that. 

Although Riot has now made is easier to jungle from summoner level 1 I wouldn't jump straight into that because it requires quite a few map control and awareness skills to be able to do effectively, knowing all champs as well as their cc and escapability too and knowing when to go for dragon or for ganks and when to stay and farm etc. 


TL;DR: Relax, learn one thing at a time, read guides. Tell us a role you want to play and you can get more focused tips

Yeah, that would absolutely fly with a judge. This is called ""ambiguity."" For instance, in contract law ambiguity is construed against the drafter. Your statement was obviously ambiguous since both of us have differing, reasonable interpretations. Thus, I would win. That's generally the case in any context, but it's most common in contract law.

&gt;You're the one that went off

Let me point out where you ""went off"":

You were the first to disagree with me, including your ""your facts are wrong"" statement (I'll also note that I still don't know what facts you're talking about, since you haven't shown me proof any legal duty to nullify); not the other way around.

Then, when I pointed out the *actual* duty of a jury, you threw a bunch of useless quotes at me, said I ""don't know what the fuck [I'm] talking about,"" that I'm just ""parroting whatever b.s. they teach in law school these days"" [hint: we didn't discuss nullification in depth in law school], implied that my degree was useless (from the University of Phoenix), and then made your smartass ""this should be good"" statement.

&gt;for anyone who chooses to feel it's a duty

"java","t5_2qhd7","I agree with 99% of what you said here and good recruiters wouldn't be committing these sins as it would be a waste of their own time. 

* Point #1 - there's a simple solution to this. If you don't want to receive calls then just don't include your phone number on the resume that you're posting online. I will send an email first but if you're on a job board, with your number listed and you're a great match for my open position, I'll call. However, if I get you on the phone I will ask if it's a convenient time. Now, if you're currently working and just have a LinkedIn profile and a recruiter looked up your company's phone number and called you at work... well that's another story.

* Point #3 - The problem here is that some people will go behind our backs to apply directly. Vermicin mentioned that if the company was nice, that they'll know I reached out to you first and have paperwork to prove it. Unfortunately, it doesn't work this way. I wouldn't submit a candidate's resume unless I actually spoke to him/her first and I think everyone can agree that doing so would be unethical and unprofessional. Thing is, if I simply email you the job and the name of the company, and you decide to apply directly to them before we speak, that doesn't give me credit. Company's aren't going to play nice when it comes to being able to save money on a 5 digit fee. I know most candidates wouldn't do this but, like with the recruiting industry, all it takes is a few bad apples to ruin it for everyone.

Regarding referrals, you shouldn't look at it as being an assistant recruiter (I'm not asking you to scour the job boards or LinkedIn). I can't speak for other recruiters but when I ask for referrals I'm thinking more along the lines of, if you know someone who's a right fit for this and who is also unhappy where they are or currently unemployed, please have them call me. Wouldn't you want to help them out? If they get a new job then the referral bonus should just the cherry on top.

Never ever be afraid to try something where you go ""i don't think thats possible"" Just do it. Practice it. When the terran hits the choke; dive for those FF's. Practice your hand speed. You know how you can twirl pasta or type by touch? Yea: do those same key combos as many times as you've done those and you will start making massive leaps and bounds forward.

I know this because in SC2 my advantage was not strategy or control it was overwhelming speed. I by all rights was AWFUL at the game but since I was everywhere at once doing... EVERYTHING I managed to get out wins regardless if it was the ""correct"" decision. 

I got to this place of 300~ sustained apm by just going over a list as fast as possible in my head. Spare cycle in your head? Check what you need to do. See a unit? Make a change. Bored? Scout. Not sure whats going on? Sacrifice a unit. Scared of drops? Spread your shit out every where.

By far and away we spend more time THINKING than actually hitting buttons.

You want a mind fuck? Record your hands while playing.

You will be appalled by all the shit you DIDN'T do when you knew you should have. Once you identify the gaps and physical issues you have in your actual mechanical play you will become immensely fast. People idolize 300 apm, but thats really just slightly accelerated typing.

Good luck man, you can do this! =D","1322698170"

~~SSL/HTTPS does not encrypt data inside of the URL on any sort of request (GET,POST, etc...). Do a wireshark trace and you'll see. Google uses an http GET request to submit keywords to their search engine, and if they wanted to secure this, they would have used an http POST and placed the keyword into the body of the request, thus encrypting it along with anything else that's POSTed.

I watched [This five-part series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syKgMfbG1AY) on Vice a few days ago about a guy who lives 150 miles north of the Arctic Circle, 300 miles north of Fairbanks, with his wife. They only see people who come in planes to give them gear and collect hides and things from them. They're so removed that he's never even seen the footage of 9/11 (although he does have a gas-powered VCR, and he watches Predator and other movies sometimes). Interesting stuff, he pretty much shows how to do it and shows how hard it would be. He's an enjoyable and well-spoken guy, it was cool to see.

Here's the full description:

""In 1980, Jimmy Carter established the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in the Alaskan Interior, cutting off 19 million acres of prime boreal wilderness from the mitts of fur trappers, oil tycoons, and would-be lodge owners alike. Only six families of white settlers were grandfathered in and allowed to keep cabins in the refuge—of them, only one still stays there year-round living off the land. His name is Heimo Korth, and he is basically the Omega Man of America’s Final Frontier. Raised in suburban Wisconsin, Heimo set off in his teens to the Alaskan Bush to pursue the Davy Crockett lifestyle in more or less the only place it was still possible. Amid numerous setbacks and misadventures, Heimo gradually learned how to master his terrain, provide for his Eskimo wife, and rear children in one of the most inhospitable environments in North America. In this premiere edition of Far Out, we take a bush plane to the middle of nowhere, Alaska, to catch up with Heimo and his wife, Edna—now reaching their golden years. Over the course of our ten-day stay, the Korths show us everything you need to know about fur-trapping, caribou-hunting, caribou-eating, river-crossing, boredom-staving, bear-avoidance, and bear-defense to live happily over 100 miles from the nearest neighbors. Vegans, you have been warned.""","1322698176"

    private static String getAsterisks(int howMany){
        String asterisks = """";
        //loop howMany times, adding an asterisk to the string asterisks
        return asterisks;

then you can just call the function with the number of asterisks you want.","1322698187"

I think if you expect to find a man who doesn't watch porn, you are seriously looking for a soul mate. Which I personally do not believe in.

The issue lots of people have with Barbri is that they feel like they're doing a lot of work, because it's time consuming, but they're not actually practicing what they need to know to pass.

Walmart is the #1 employer of Elderly people and people without a high school degree. They also promote from within, not to mention provide goods at lower prices, which raises the standard of living for low-income households.

I personally do not own stock in Walmart, due to the fact the Walton Kin have an excessive amount of voting shares, and aren't exactly the smart type of businessman that Sam Walton was.

I'd rather invest in Costco, because:

* James Sinegal is the founder and is still the CEO

* The company is focused on long-term growth and has an [excellent strategy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco#Sales_model) for reducing costs associated with retail selling of goods.

* They provide excellent goods and services

* [This Chart](http://www.google.com/finance?q=Costco#)

* [They pay their workers more than minimum wage, and also provide more health and other benefits than Walmart or Costco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costco#Labor_relations)

It's up to us, as Consumers and investors, to make every dollar that we spend count. If you don't like Walmart, you should shop and invest somewhere else. That's the power of the free-market: No Government Interference Necessary.","1322698206"

Please explain quotes like this?

&gt; The last group that had to be careful during this time was scholars. Early attempts to reform the educational curriculum to keep pace with contemporary European influences were exterminated during the 1640s and 1650s by the Inquisition. The central target was Fray Diego Rodriguez (1569–1668), who took the First Chair in Mathematics and Astronomy at the Royal and Pontifical University in 1637, and tried to introduce the scientific ideas of Galileo and Kepler to the New World. For thirty years, he argued the removal of theology and metaphysics from the study of science. He was the leader of a small circle of academics that met semi-clandestinely in private homes to discuss new scientific ideas. Political struggles of the 1640s, however, brought the suspicions of the Inquisition down upon them and a series of investigations and trials followed into the middle of the 1650s. When academics worked to hide books banned by the Holy Office’s edit in 1647, the Inquisition required all six booksellers in the city to subject their lists to scrutiny under the threat of fine and excommunication.","1322698210"

Honestly, I have no idea, I havent watched any of the sports scene personally, I just know there is a huge one.  The last sports game I played was some NFL game on the dreamcast.


&gt; I don't think a mouse and keyboard is necessary for FPS games though

Would you be comfortable playing against people playing with them, in a game that had no 'aim assist' for controllers? How do you think the best of the best console players will do against the best keyboard/mouse players?

I know thats been possible before with Q3A on the dreamcast, and more recently UT2k3 on PS3, and from what I've heard even 'bad' mouse users do noticably better.



It will certainly be interesting when CS:GO comes out if they retain the cross-platform playing they were talking about.

"mctourney","t5_2t4zh","In Rules 3 and 7, you imply that it's okay for teams to attack each other's victory monuments, which is in opposition to Vechs' recommended rule in the readme that ""Players should agree to not target the enemy Victory Monument with TNT canons."" I actually like us being able to attack the other teams' victory monument. It adds variety to the gameplay and more opportunities for creative strategies. However, one point that brings up is that the rules you state above do vary from the rules that Vechs has laid out in some significant ways, which has the potential to lead to confusion, with different teams playing by different sets of rules, seeing each other as cheating. (Perhaps the most important variation between the Vechs' rules and the rules above is that Vechs' rules require players who are involuntarily moved out of their lane by game effects to immediately fall into the void and die, while the rules above do not).  

As a solution to this potential problem, I would like to suggest that you explicitly state whether the rules in the map readme will or will not be used in addition to the rules above (with any exceptions you feel are appropriate), and if they will be used, which set of rules will take precedence in the case of a contradiction.

As a side note, I would also like to suggest that the rule requiring players to fall into the void if they are moved out their lane by a game effect is a good one, and it should be used in this tournament. In fact, I would actually suggest that the rule be expanded to cover players unintentionally moving out of their lanes for any reason (they get disoriented, the server lags, their keyboard sticks, whatever).

However, now? They swung the nerf hammer twice. Both indirectly, but both significant. They changed jungle to his disadvantage -more small camps need to be cleared which junglers with aoe do so much better- and disabled shreds on dragon/baron.

"trees","t5_2r9vp","When I was 13, I remember stumbling upon my older cousin's diary. She wrote it in French to try and keep her secrets better protected. Unfortunately for her, I had been taking French in school for 2 years now and had ready access to Babelfish or Freetranslate or whatever site we used before Google Translate.

In it, I found an entry that claimed she had a friend who sold weed. And how over the course of high school, she had finally come to accept weed as an ok drug for other people to use. How she realized that the things she had previously been taught about the drug was wrong and how she was felt enlightened. Her younger self had been wrong to condemn the drug freshman year.

Reading this at 13, I was shocked. But I also wanted to accept this intelligent position because I looked up to my cousin and knew she was smart. I barely knew anything about weed, except that it existed and people smoked it. And smoking is bad because of cancer.

I'm entirely sure how I felt on the drug front - probably a little uncomfortable but I had been trying to understand and adopt more thought out positions on all controversial subjects. A silly tween trying to force her way into being open-minded. I know now that not how it works.

I carried that memory around for a long time and thought back to it any time one of my friends made a joke about weed though. I wasn't sure exactly how much I believed in it but I so desperately wanted to. 

Finally, when I smoked for the first time many years later and learned more about it, I could honestly understand and support that opinion I had read so many years earlier.

Yes, I did, I also noted that it was irrelevant.

If the characters being fictitious bugs you than the entire example is not worth looking into, no matter what was within. It shuold have been obvious that I was pointing to the intentions of the authors.

&gt;And Chris Rock perpetuates the negative image of blacks in the mainstream media and thinks he's fighting for the cause. Yeah, nice one.

This is irrelevant, the important thing is he is a mainstream comedian who is well liked who has made jokes of this nature (and those jokes were well received). This in and of itself proves the comedic worth of this style of joke. He is an excellent example.

For example, it's just as stupid to drive drunk when you have half a mile to get home as when you have ten miles to get home. Sure the chance of a wreck goes down but you're still being stupid.
However I see that what you mean is that longer commutes means more total time spent on roads per driver and I agree. However I still think that the emphasis on safety in europe is one of the biggest reasons for the dramatic difference in road safety. Having lived in a few european countries I can guarantee that the average european is better trained and more serious about their driving than the average american.

The budding game designer: Bioshock, starcraft(1 or 2 prefferably 2), super smash brothers and pokemon.

Bioshock for amazing storytelling and a great sense of atmosphere

Starcraft to learn just how in depth a strategy can go

super smash to learn how to make a game ""fun"" without dumbing it down

pokemon to learn that ""easy to learn hard to master"" mentality

For somebody who has never played a video game.

Tetris, super mario brothers, and rock band

For that hardcore veteran gamer.

Dark souls because you need to experience how badly a game can fuck you

super smash brothers because sometimes you need to be reminded of what good fun is.

and finally

prince of persia (the original).","1322698247"

I think my mind was focused on our species and our way of knowing our own subjective experience. They actually put this up as a problem, their example was bats. Bats navigate through echolocation and we have a functional understanding of how this works but we cannot know how it is like to be a bat and thinking about being a bat. So I just kept my reasoning to our own understanding of what it is like to be a human and have a consciousness.  

So if I apply my reasoning to this question of being a bat and thinking about being a bat... Their brain works functionally and they can use their abilities without having an understanding of them. Their consciousness would then be a consequence of all the functions in their brains. They wouldn't have a separate function that makes them bats consciously. They would just be bats consciously as a consequence of having the brains that they have.","1322698254"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","NO the issue is female representation in games, when men get full battle armour and women get tiny revealing costumes on overly sexualised characters it's sexist. If the male and female characters are both dressed and designed similarly whether that means they are fully clothed or almost naked, overtly sexual or very unattractive then people would not have a problem because genders are being treated equally. 

Also that gun example is pure stupidity, you could realistically be against a game which encourages your character to indiscriminately kill hundreds of people, while responsibly owning a gun that you use for example in shooting competitions.  The simple fact that you own a bikini does not mean that you are happy with female characters running in to battle wearing them.

Also the act of women walking around topless is actually illegal and regarded indecent exposure in many western countries. Why do you think those topless protests happen?  In America a woman's right to be topless while sunbathing is actually only recognised in Washington, D.C, New York, Maine, Ohio, Hawaii and Texas. ","1322698256"

People are there for themselves.

However, the food was one click slightly too far into the 'concept' area of food ([menu here](http://www.matterhorn.co.nz/sites/default/files/menuitem/dinner/matterhorndinnermenu28nov.pdf)). I ordered a dinner called ""The Whole Duck"" ($25) which turned out to be five separate jellies and pâté's arranged on a plate. The concept being that each jelly was made from a different part of the duck. Apart from the waiter telling me ""Jelly A"" was made from the scalp or something, I had no idea what I was eating and I genuinely didn't enjoy it, unfortunately.

"investing","t5_2qhhq","I'll confess I'm a novice at valuations ... basically glance at P/E periodically and follow along with a few long-looking sages (e.g. Grantham @ GMO). E.g. http://online.wsj.com/mdc/public/page/2_3021-peyield.html and http://www.gmo.com/America/default.htm (no-pay reg. wall @ the latter) - edit: just logged in to check, and yeah, GMO (for what it's worth) thinks we can expect about-market-average returns over the next seven years on ex-US stocks, which is particularly not-bad given the likely returns on bonds ;)

The thing is, though, that market-timing is tricky business regardless between now and then ... I could see the logic behind a tactical asset allocation that shifted somewhat, but it is just too easy to be out at the wrong time and never find that 'entry point' again - believe me, I know a lot of people who are still waiting and looking, and they *need* another crash to justify having been out these last few years :/

 The reason I like folks like Grantham is that he isn't trying to predict the next mood swing, but instead is looking at what we can expect over longer periods - go out ten years and even Jack Bogle will weight in on expectations, but ask those guys about next month and both will (rightfully, IMHO) throw up their hands and admit they don't know any better than anyone else ;)

The bottom line: what happens if you're wrong, and the market *never drops dramatically to below current levels again* - I'm not betting on it either way.","1322698272"
"askscience","t5_2qm4e","1st law of thermodynamics states (oversimplified) that energy is always conserved. There is no way to destroy it, only change its form. Therefore the kinetic energy lost in a inelastic collision went somewhere. Was it sound? Heat? 

That being said, you are not going to find a perfectly elastic collision ""in the wild."" The way I show my students this is by dropping a bouncy ball from a known hight. Because potential energy from gravity is a function of hight, you can use the hight the ball reaches after the bounce to (roughly) determine the amount of kinetic energy conserved.

I go there because it's the page where you can see how many questions you have answered in common with the person you're looking at.  Without that number, OkCupid is effectively worthless IMO.

OkCupid is all about the match scores.  They're the reason it works so much better than all other dating/friending/profile sites.  But you can't interpret the match score without knowing how many questions you have in common.  In the old days they'd adjust your match score significantly based on the uncertainty they'd calculate from your overlap, but a few years ago they changed it and now the automatic adjustment is very small and not useful.  That was the worst change OkCupid ever made.

More or less my rule of thumb is:

0-50 questions in common: Match score completely useless.  Don't even bother looking at the profile.  Move on.

50-100 questions in common: Match score probably significantly off.  Skip this profile unless there's something especially awesome about it.  And something else especially awesome about it.

100-300 questions in common: Okay, this may be a meaningful match score, but take it with several grains of salt.

300+ questions in common: You can probably trust this score.  Proceed as normal.

"shittyaskhistory","t5_2t1hm","Christmas, thought by many to be a festival with a complex history, with roots in a plethora of religions and cultures, is actually a much more recent phenomenon, and it's origins are singular and very easy to place. Rather than being a Christian adaption of a Pagan tradition, as so often claimed, Christmas actually began as a promotional event, borne of the excesses of our consumer culture.

The year was 1984, and the up-and-coming singer-songwriter Madonna was preparing for the release of her second album, *Like A Virgin*. Whilst her first album was successful, and cemented her as an exciting talent, Madonna had high aspirations for her second album - aspirations that would be difficult to live up to. This led her marketing team into a brainstorming session, designed to invent a novel marketing ploy to boost sales of the record. With the album scheduled for release for 12th November, one bright spark happened upon an idea that would change the face of capitalism: a festival, held at the twilight of the year, dedicated to consumerism and family values. This was eventually to become Christmas.

The attraction of this idea was twofold: the consumerist agenda of ""gifts"" would provide a huge boost to stores, businesses and corporations across many consumer-based industries, giving them a boost in profits at a time of the year where, due to the cold weather, people are naturally thrifty. The music industry - and therefore Madonna - were set to profit from this move more than most, due to the faux-personal angle of gifts with emotional connotations, of which music is a prime example. In short, a festival based on the exchange of gifts was a goldmine for industries that dealt primarily in products suitable for gifting.

The other attraction was the ""family values"" connotation of the festival. This appealed to naturally apathetic middle-class families - people who wouldn't be taken in easily by the idea of idle consumerism, but would jump at the chance to spend more time with their family. By promoting the event as family oriented, they guaranteed much more attention than if the event was designed solely as an excuse to give and receive presents.

At this point, the only missing piece was the name. To further ensnare the Christian majority, the marketers decided to use religious imagery, and, after passing over ""God Day"" and ""Jesusmas"", the equally unimaginative name of ""Christmas"" was chosen.  The religious angle was of especial benefit to Madonna, as her name alone - as Godless as her music and persona was - evoked images of wholesome Christianity. And with that, the foundations of Christmas were erected.

Over the summer of 1984, the festival began to take shape: promotional adverts were taken out in newspapers, and billboards were emblazoned with slogans promoting it. References were included in TV shows and films, and various industries teamed together to lobby for December 25th - a day chosen for proximity to the end of the year, cementing the day as a celebration of one year becoming the next, encouraging people to spend further, as well as distance from any other major profit-turning festival - to be declared a national holiday. The motion was passed by Congress in September; by this point, the easily manipulated public were enamored with the idea of Christmas, and the festival's position as a focal point of the year was set in stone.

*Like A Virgin* was released on November 12th, 1984. Whilst Madonna had wanted to release it closer to the festival that had been created to promote it, a contract had been signed with the record company releasing the album, and they were eager to get it out as soon as possible. However, despite the eventual ill-timing of the release, the ploy worked - the album reached #1 in five countries, was certified diamond in America, and has, to date, sold 21 million copies. Madonna went on to become a pop icon, and *Like A Virgin* became one the best known albums of the '80s - and whilst her next release, *True Blue*, went on to outsell it, it was very much *Like A Virgin* that set the ball rolling.

As for Christmas, it's popularity boomed, and it continued to get more and more popular year on year. The industry had created an impressive back-story - one that gets repeated *ad nauseum* to this day -which, in a testimony to the power of social conditioning, caused many to believe that Christmas actually had the historical precedent assigned to it, and had been celebrated in their childhood. It eventually snowballed into the worldwide festival of we still celebrate today - but one must not forget it's origins, as a clever marketing ploy and experiment in mass brainwashing, and one that proved George Orwell much more prophetic than he is ever given credit for.

"politics","t5_2cneq","The idea that individuals are somehow going to be able to sue large companies ""once the EPA stops interfering"" is rather laughable.

Lets say you have some farmer whose cows are dropping calves with deformities of some kind. 

Without the EPA here is what happens:

He has to pay for the investigation that determines that the cause is the plant dumping into the river upstream.
Then he has to sue a big company that has a fleet of high-grade lawyers on retainer. 

Even if he has an absolutely airtight case, the lawyers are going to drag things out. They can do this for YEARS without doing anything thats going to get them nailed for malpractice.

Years that go by where the farmer is hemorrhaging cash, since hes paying his own lawyers and he hasn't got any healthy livestock to sell to actually generate income.
 
Or look at the use of DDT.  The damage it caused was widespread and devastating but poorly understood. **20+ years** went by before the issue achieved attention significant enough to result in change.

Said change was people realizing ""holy shit, the existing system doesn't protect against this at all!"", resulting in the creation of the EPA 30 years after the beginning of its use.

In short, the idea that the EPA is redundant and can be eliminated without significant lasting harm to the environment or public health is laughable to anyone with even the most passing knowledge of the matters at stake.

i don't think this dude has any idea what he's talking about.

he shows the binomial formula and says it's exponential.

then he says exponential function is like magnets, they clap together at near distance, where in fact it's quadratic formula.

i stopped watching there.

actually i watched a little bit more. he gives a puzzle about football field. given that he has made so many errors before, i decided to check that. so he says that football stadium would be full in 50mins.

so one droplet of water is 0.05ml. after 50 minutes we'll have 2^49 * 0.05ml of water, which is 2.81*10^7 cubic meters of water.

football field has area of 5350 m², and height is 30 meters. since there is space around the field itself, let's give it area of 8000 m². the volume then is 8000m^2 * 30m = 240000m^3 = 2.4*10^5.

what the fuck dude in glasses, you just underestimated your shit by two orders.

if it looks hockey stick, it doesn't mean it's exponential.

The reason I recommend Type II programs heavily is because they focus on teaching kids the skills they need and slowly transitioning them into the public school, or at least that's how mine was.

This is a page explaining Type II programs, and what they (Hannah More) offer for the students. http://www.hannahmore.org/AcademicPrograms.html

If you have any questions about the programs, or possibly what some good ones are in your area, I **might** be able to get you in contact with Joe Dickson. He was the education director for the HM programs at both my middle and high schools, and we are good friends. I'd imagine he would be able to help point you in the right direction.","1322698302"

I was talking to someone over the Assasin's Creed DS game a few years ago. It looked like Prince of Persia on the Gameboy Colour. I said ""You realise this will very likely be awful and will clearly have no resemblance to the gameplay of Assassin's Creed?"" and he said gameplay comes first etc. But when you are comparing  something like Prince of Persia on the Gameboy compared to a ""real"" AAA title on a console there's really no comparison. Those portable games almost never have the capacity to be as intricate or involving as a game on console or PC.

Art style in Braid is different, that's going for a different look intentionally while using modern hardware. It's also an XBLA title released alongside other modern games. It still looks ""good"" because it's not a game with six pixels representing a character. It still has ""good"" graphics, but some people act as if some game on an Atari, were it released today, can compare to other modern games. Graphics clearly play a huge part in immersion, believability, and even the legitimacy of the platform as a creative artform.

My suspicion is that this is the same for *some* fundamentalists; but that others also do adopt certain positions on ""faith"" as a result of their wholehearted acceptance of dogma.","1322698323"
"WTF","t5_2qh61","In the late 90's, I rented a room from a molecular biologist working for a pharma startup. Through spending time with him and his colleagues, I gained some insight into the industry, and I am aware that development is expensive, as for the tools you cite costing millions of dollars, I have no doubt this is true... for the same reason that touch-screen monitors used in the medical industry are expensive, because they CAN be.

In most circumstances, it has nothing to do with the difficulty of manufacture, nor the rarity of the materials, just that so few companies manufacture medical equipment, that they can charge what they want, knowing that Big Pharma companies are rich enough to pay for them. 

The burden of blame does not rest on the shoulders of the researchers, but on, yet again, corporate execs who's only interest is to make the company wealthier by any means necessary.

"skyrim","t5_2s837","According to Michael Kirkbride, one of the lore writers for the Elder Scrolls series, the reason the Thalmor are so keen in banning Talos worship is that it's the first step in their master plan to achieve immortality.

From [here](http://www.imperial-library.info/content/forum-archives-michael-kirkbride):

**What appears to be an Altmeri commentary on Talos:**

To kill Man is to reach Heaven, from where we came before the Doom Drum's iniquity. When we accomplish this, we can escape the mockery and long shame of the Material Prison.

To achieve this goal, we must:

1) Erase the Upstart Talos from the mythic. His presence fortifies the Wheel of the Convention, and binds our souls to this plane.

2) Remove Man not just from the world, but from the Pattern of Possibility, so that the very idea of them can be forgotten and thereby never again repeated.

3) With Talos and the Sons of Talos removed, the Dragon will become ours to unbind. The world of mortals will be over. The Dragon will uncoil his hold on the stagnancy of linear time and move as Free Serpent again, moving through the Aether without measure or burden, spilling time along the innumerable roads we once travelled. And with that we will regain the mantle of the imperishable spirit.","1322698326"

Because it's a bicuspid valve when it should be tricuspid, it basically means there is less room for the blood to pass through. This problem is compounded when calcium deposits in the aortic valve, increasing the narrowing of the valve. (Calcium deposits in the aortic valve are common in everyone in their later years.) Aortic stenosis is simply a narrowing of the valves. More pressure is needed to push the blood through the aortic valve, and that pressure is generated by an enlarged the left ventricle. (An enlarged left ventricle is a problem in itself because it adds stress to the heart). Another problem is an increased risk of infection of the valve, known as endocarditis. Both complications are relatively minor in the grand scheme of things. Endocarditis can usually be treated with an antibiotic, and the aortic stenosis is detected long before it causes problems using an Echocardiogram. ","1322698328"

You can't tell a pedophile simply ""Don't do it, it's wrong."" That doesn't work... besides pedophiles already know it is wrong. They need to realize they can reach satisfaction through ways that don't actually involve children. Through the use of sex toys, or consensual adult role play.

If the pedophile is willing to take alternate means to fulfill their desires I do think they can be helped and become a ""normal"" member of society. But if they are not willing to take the steps to change, then no... they'll still be a predator and be a risk to all of society. ","1322698329"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My older brother. He was a terror like none other during his childhood; he would kill stray animals for no other reason than he could, no school in the southern quarter of my state would take him because of how violent he was with other students, he was moved from foster home to foster home when his parents (my father, his mother) were incapable of reigning him in, and he was in juvie for the better part of 6 years (moved from center to center, at that). He got a 15 year old pregnant when he was 19 and then proceeded to have 6 more children (of which only three are legitimate). He was incapable of holding down any job, so my parents basically paid every bill for his family. He joined the national guard and was dishonorably discharged prior to 9/11; he later rejoined, but with the understanding that he'd spend the remainder of his term in prison if he screwed up. He came home a ""broken war hero""; he ""saw some stuff"" and that gave him carte blanche to beat his wife, beat his kids, and issue threats to anyone who was of no use to him. He broke my second eldest niece's femur, and basically forces my eldest niece to run the house; she has to cook, clean, and care for her sisters. He lives vicariously through her: in order to be an ""American Idol winner"", he makes her practice guitar and singing for hours at a time. I'll be downvoted into oblivion for saying it, but I genuinely hope the man dies in prison; some people are monsters because of their up bringing, some due to trauma, and others are simply born that way.

EDIT: When I say he killed stray animals because he could, I mean it quite literally. He didn't do it because he was angry, because he was lashing out at the world, or trying to get some sick thrill out of it; he did it because he was physically capable of doing so and because the repercussions were practically non-existent for taking an animal's life in the middle of nowhere.","1322698333"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Very good points. I'm not in the US so I may not have as good an understanding of what was happening. But the subprime fiasco has me curious. Since the practice of bundling liabilities as assets is still being practiced in many countries, and those bubbles have yet to pop.

I agree with you that the US version definitely seems like a failure of government regulatory laws. That this was even allowed to happen speak volumes of the influence that large corporations have over lawmakers. Since the US is one, if not the outright, first that has to deal with the results, the lessons that would be learned in trying to solve this problem there would be invaluable to the rest of the world. Wresting corporate control over lawmakers seems to be the biggest hurdle so far.","1322698338"

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","I'm going to assume your question wasn't just rhetorical. 

Both this letter and the snarky feminist one allude to academic work in the area of rape myth acceptance and its relationship to rape proclivity but do not explicitly cite studies. If they had, your pertinent and astutely skeptical concerns might have been met. 

In fact, rape myth acceptance was widely studied beginning in the '80s, and [this study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.284/abstract) from 2005 finds that when rape-prone men are ""primed"" to remember that they think of rape as acceptable, they self-report a higher likelihood to rape. **The study argues for causation, not just correlation.** (Cue all the usual caveats: causation is hard to demonstrate, this was a laboratory setting, etc. This is *not* my field so I can't comment on whether the study has been widely cited, repeated, etc.) 

I'm guessing this is the body of academic work that both letters reference without citations. *If* you accept the research at face-value, the arguments in both places are strengthened: rape jokes and silence about the unacceptability of rape do have a significant impact on the likelihood of rape-prone men to rape. 

Does the same hold true for other non-PC jokes? I'd guess that racist jokes confirm and make socially acceptable racist views, but that they don't necessarily have a causal link to violent crime against people of color (though I'd bet that they prompt casual and even illegal racist behavior, i.e. in hiring practices). I'd guess that since there are fewer murder-prone folks walking around, jokes about murder don't have a causal impact on a person's likelihood of killing someone. For the rest--cheaters, alcoholics, over-eaters--I'd guess that the same social acceptability leading to increased likelihood of behavior pattern seen among rapists holds but the difference is that none of these things are violent crimes. Rape is.

Final note: I don't think artists ought to censor themselves or bow to pressure from advocacy groups. In fact, I think the transgressive exercise of free speech is a really good thing now and again. However, I do think it's instructive for all of us to consider these arguments the next time we're hanging out in a group and someone makes a rape joke--artistic license and free speech aren't at stake, and a future rape might be.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Your two options are to have been an ATT customer long enough for them to, due to good customer service, give you the unlock code for free, or to buy it from someone who buys the code from ATT.

Basically, the phone is locked to accept only ATT circuitry on the SIM and ATT is in possession of the unlock codes. You can attempt to back calculate what the code must be, but all the times I've ever tried I've failed miserably. I'd pay the $5 to a third party company for the unlock code, personally, and follow the command prompts necessary to unlock the phone. You will need the phone's IMEI number (it is unique to each phone like a MAC address is to each network card) which can be found typically on the sticker under the battery and also through some menu commands. This is going to be the cheapest and easiest way.

Another note, don't expect to be able to use 3G speeds in Kenya. You will have basic GSM only. Even though it is a world phone - meaning that it can connect with towers all around the world (minus Japan and Israel) - it only has 3G radios tuned to US ATT frequencies. You cannot even get 3G on TMo, the other US GSM provider.

The ability to swap SIMs in and out in what makes GSM the global standard and why people like it so much. Alas, most of the US is on CDMA which causes your phone to be locked to your provider and cannot be used outside of the country.","1322698353"

One day, when she was a few months old, we had to leave her alone for a pretty long time. I come home and the delicious scent of fresh dog poop lingering in the air tells me that she's broken mother's sacred no twosies on the fucking floor rule. After half an hour of searching, I'm about ready to admit defeat when I notice one of the curtains (the type that are so long, they drag on the floor) was suspiciously pulled away from the window so that it almost looks like a tent. One of my dog's precious toys sits on top of the end of said curtain. As I approach this brujeria shit, my dog starts to act adorably guilty. I look behind the curtain and come to the realization that my dog's the fucking poop hide-and-seek savant. She had positioned the curtain so that it would cover the poop and used her toy to hold it in position. Say what you will, but my dog's a fucking genius.

If you are qualified for the Nuclear program you shouldnt have a problem signing as a Nuke because the rating is undermanned.  The only thing, for example, might be that they are full for November so you have to sign to enter December, or something like that. 

If you do DEP in as something else you can change it to Nuke later.  I dont know your recruiter but I would say this, if you sign as something else and are qualified/want to do Nuke make sure you change your contract for that. If he tells you that you can't change he is lying.  Until you raise your hand and take the oath the day you leave for bootcamp YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED to anything and can break your DEP contract without enlisting.

"DJs","t5_2rddy","Tropical Bass is my ish (from UK Funky to Brazilian Baile Funk to Mexican 3ball to Angolan Kuduro to... yes... bits of Soca, Reggaeton, and Dancehall), so I might be able to give you some pointers.

You'll find rapidly that many ""authentic"" Soca, Reggaeton, and Dancehall tracks (read: those that have not crossed over into House music territory) aren't structured all that differently from Hip Hop. Many tracks begin with vocal shout-outs featuring light teaser percussion/melody. It's the same for Baile Funk and Kuduro, which are actually heavily influenced by Soca music. As such, when you sit down and practice, you'll find mixing them not dissimilar from mixing music you're already familiar with!

That said, you've obviously got your homework cut out for you. Like Hip Hop, you're going to have know your tracks inside-and-out so that you know where all of the prime mix-in/mix-out points are, as you probably won't have clean intros and outros to do long blends with. Turntablism helps here, but if you're not much of a turntablist (I know I'm not...), then short blends and well-timed slam-fades often work just fine.

As for where you can find some of these tracks... Let's take Soca for example. I'd suggest pulling up your iTunes store and looking for some Soca comps. [Like this one, perhaps.](http://itunes.apple.com/us/album/soca-gold-2011/id434959601) Next up, start looking for Soca mixes, [like this one from the British crew The Heatwave, which was showcased on the Mad Decent label blog.](http://maddecent.com/blog/the-heatwave-soca-season-2011-mix) Or searching Youtube, [which has an absolutely retarded number of them](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_type=videos&amp;search_query=soca+mix&amp;search_sort=video_date_uploaded). These will introduce you to a wide variety of Soca artists. Do the same for Reggaeton and Dancehall. Boom. You have the knowledge around which to build a collection.

However, CCS is 1. expensive, 2. requires lots of engineering, 3. requires the creation of a new pipeline infrastructure to collect CO2 and dump it way down deep in the ocean, 4. causes massive efficiency losses for CO2 compression and transmission unless you move to IGCC or oxy-fuel combustion in which case you only lose a moderate amount of efficiency.

But if you want to talk about skill... 

""Ken used to be a ridculous player, and you are saying that just because Nintendo didn't intend for Smash to be competitive, or that items are banned, makes Ken's skill less impressive?""

YES. How much more impressive would that streak be if nothing at all was banned? If items were randomly coming down that his opponents were able to use against him? If the stage wasn't perfectly flat and he was still able to pull off win after win? Things that are random and unfair, but still winning. Of course, it would be much more impressive.

""Yet, the game doesn't get any respect from a skill perspective.""

It's a game meant for kids, of course it isn't going to get much respect from a skill perspective (regardless of how difficult the professional game is from a skill perspective). The whole point of the game is to have as little skill as possible as a barrier between players having a good time and enjoying themselves. Yes, playing it on a pro level is hard and there can be a hell of a lot of technical ability required, but as long as the game is meant for kids, it's going to have that stigma attached to it, sorry.

""Smash players don't ban thing based on cheapness, they ban things that are random and aren't competitive.""

If the Street Fighter community did the same thing, there wouldn't ever have been a competitive community at all since almost everything in the game in the SFII era had randomness in it, at times an extreme amount of randomness. It didn't hurt competition. It's an excuse. If you are good at the game, you are good at the game. You shouldn't need to ban anything unless you want a crutch.","1322698372"

"esports","t5_2r08k","1. I don't have a problem with console gaming. I enjoyed my consoles as a child. I don't play console anymore. There is essentially no reason to. They cost a lot of money, not to mention the TV I would have to buy. And for what? I can only think of one or two games worth playing on consoles (MvC3 and niche games like racing or mech combat).

2. Depends, for the most part no. 

FPS games deserve to be on PC, and the best FPS games for competition are all on PC (Quake, CS, and CoD if you really want to include CoD as competitive). Mice and keyboards are just a better interface between player and game for FPS (RTS as well but that goes without saying).

Other competitive games are a bit less clear. As far as I'm aware, the only other major genre is fighting games, and almost all fighting players use Arcade Sticks. PS3s have input lag on these, making them immediately inferior for pro play. Xbox is completely on par with PC, except that Xbox has more players online and a bigger list of fighting games. So I think Xbox wins, even though I'd love to see PC fighting games become more popular. Maybe with SFxT for PC developers will start porting their games more.

3. I did a speed run of Halo 3 with some mates, I don't know if that counts as competitive. I count speed running as a competition, but others might not. Other than that, no.

4. Yes, I've watched competitive Halo and CoD on consoles, as well as fighting games. It was still a little interesting, but not as impressive as Quake or CS. All I can think is 'Wow, he could've made that shot if he had a mouse, oh well'.

5. No, for the reasons I've said already. The current console controllers just aren't a good interface for playing games with speed and accuracy.

I'm not saying console gamers don't have skill. I couldn't do the shit they do. But if they spent their time training with a mouse and keyboard they would be able to make more impressive shots and generally be more effective at the game.

Your only option to stop this sort of hackery is to run the entire game simulation on the server, having the game itself act as a dumb UI. This has lots of downsides, such as lag, server costs, etc., and it only stops people from directly modifying the game experience.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I am also 22 and in college.  I'm a nutrition and dietetics major so I know a few tips that can help you!

Nutrition:
Buy frozen vegetables, they are easy to cook (no washing) and fast!  They are also frozen after they have been picked and washed, so there aren't any preservatives.  Sometimes, they are considered better than fresh.  

Apple, bananas and oranges seem to be the fruit that have the longest shelf life.  If you have a trader joes, they have cheap apples and oranges.  

Natural Peanut butter, whole grain bread and jelly are an excellent snack giving you protein, starch, carbs and lasting energy. (longer lasting than junk food)  

If you can afford it, buy roasted (unsalted) almonds and cashews, some chocolate chips and dried cranberries to make your own trail mix.  These are a great snack to drop in a bag when you're on the go.  They are also great accompanied with fruit and water!

If you have a freezer, buy the family pack of chicken breasts, cut them into tenders and place them (2 tenders) in sandwich bags and freeze them.  This way you are giving yourself a serve of protein for one meal and also retaining from eating high fat meats.  Buying value sized meat and freezing can save you half of what you would have spent on two smaller packages of chicken.

Exercise:
It's hard to lose fat in the areas where we store it most.  I think it's best if you focus on being healthy and losing the fat in a general sense.  As long as you have a solid exercise routine, you can see results.  Here's what I found has worked for me.

10 minutes cardio warm up - light jog to start a sweat
15 min stretching - you don't want to cramp or feel tight
20-30 min strength - lifting weight, resistance, boxing, martial arts, pull ups, etc
30-40 min cardio - jogging, fast walking, hiking, cycling, etc
5 min cool down - steady walk

As for training to jog/run 5-10 miles comfortably, you'll have to train separately.  Try intervals!
For example:
Monday - 2 miles
Tuesday - rest (you might be sore)
Wednesday - 2 miles
Thursday - 3 miles
Friday - 2 miles
Saturday - 3 miles
Sunday - Rest

New week ~
Monday - 3 miles
Tuesday - 4 miles
Wednesday - rest
Thursday - 4 miles
Friday - 3 miles
Saturday - 5 miles
Sunday - Rest

This way you run within your boundaries and are slowly increasing your endurance to where you can run comfortably, but still get an efficient work out.  

Nutrition and exercise go hand in hand, and it's key you don't forget it!  If you don't fuel your body with enough carbohydrates, fat and protein, you'll find that working out will be harder.  Carbohydrates are your best source of fuel for your pre/post workouts, so as long as you keep yourself fueled before and after your workout, you'll lose the weight.  

There is so much to know about how to efficiently lose weight and how to keep your body healthy.  It's just too much to type.  if you're interested, I have a youtube channel that has more information, also, you can email me if you want to know more!

"investing","t5_2qhhq","&gt; I have never stated that this is about ""a big return"".

The **ONLY** reason to invest in singular stocks is to get a big return. That's what you don't understand. The only reason to take on the excess risk is the excess risk premium you get for that risk. There's two things to consider with equities. Risk, reward. More risk needs more reward. The strategies you give have more risk, less reward.

&gt; When did I ever mention this buy-low-sell-high being central to any strategy? Never.

&gt;&gt;ONLY buy on market tumbles drastically increasing your income/upside. Sells should only be triggered by complete collapses or unreasonable/unsustainable price explosions on the laggards.

Whenever you make a statement ""buy/sell when [something happens]"" you are timing the market. Timing the market is almost impossible.

Absolutely everything you do, everything you post, revolves around the idea that you know something others don't. All the research you did? Thousands and thousands of others have done it to. Every equity hedge fund has dozens of guys doing exactly what you're doing, probably better. Goldman Sachs knows what you know. Citadel knows what you know. Morgan Stanley knows what you know. They see the same numbers you see. It's already priced into the stock.

It just boggles my mind how you don't accept this. You're gambling, plain and simple. And what's worse, is you claim what you're doing is a conservative level-headed approach.

&gt; Your opinion is ""buy an index fund"". Cool. I disagree. IMHO

It's not my opinion. It's commonly accepted theory proven by countless studies and statistical backing by people much much smarter than you and I. You say ""IMHO"", but what you mean is ""IMHO I disagree with almost every single living PhD in Finance, Economics, and Math. They are wrong, and I'm right"". I hate to quote misnamed, but you really are letting your hubris cloud your judgement.

edit:Actually, upon reading some of your other posts it's become clear you just don't understand where indexing comes from. It's not just ""a strategy that's worked historically"". It's the result of the capital-asset pricing model. Even before the idea of indexing, [Markowitz showed mathematically](http://www.risiko-manager.com/fileadmin/_temp_/Markowitz-Portfolio.jpg) that a portfolio consisting of every asset in the market weighted by it's size is the optimal portfolio with regards to risk and reward. All the ""history has shown you can't beat the market so index instead"" posts you've been getting are simply evidence he was right (after the fact). It's not something someone tried, backtested, and said ""hey guys, we should do this because it's been a winner!"". It's mathematical theory which has proven to hold true. For someone who apparently is interested in the subject of equity investments, and may even know a thing or two, the fact you don't fully understand the implications of optimizing a portfolio is mildly baffling.","1322698392"

I understand what your saying, perhaps money can cause problems when viewed from a mine mine, ME ME, mentality, but I do not see why that can't be worked out outside of the confines of simply pooling it together.

I guess from where I sit I see pooling your money together as a form of engulfment that seems unnecessary. Why couldn't you still have separate funds and be just as smart and as considerate with your money without the complications that inevitably come in with including other people. Not to say any one is being malicious, but accidents happen, or particularly if your SO is prone to a shopping addiction or something .

Here's the scenario I am afraid of,

Everything is fine and hunky dorey until that one day I think to myself, I want product X, or I want to go do X. Fine great, what happens if it turns out regardless of how frivolous it is you really want to do X, but your SO will now get upset with you because he/she wholeheartedly disagrees with you about you doing X, regardless of the logic. I think when the money is pooled, it puts unnecessary strain on a relationship by adding the extra factor of, ""if you spend any of ""OUR"" money, you might make me unhappy."" When it could be I am going to go do this thing regardless, and if its a stupid decision I will have learned that lesson on my own.

This may be a bit republican of me, but if I want to contribute more to my SO I just will and I will decide when to give said amount of money to that person at my leisure instead of automatically.

On a separate note, and if you read my history really far back, I recognize that I have some severe trust issues stemming from some poor choices with women in my life, and I am entitled to that. I am not saying I wouldn't ever trust somebody, but it certainly would take a long time, and even still I think there are some things about me that need to remain... me essentially.

I think as a man living in today's, Starbucks mocha Frappachino, Marriage 2.0 kind of world, It is silly to so easily lie down and put your trust in the other gender entirely, when so easily they can come back at you and take it all with something as simple as filing a court order. 

Again, its just scary, no matter how much i trust a woman, (I am dating btw), something still irks me because I know the power to screw me over by law rests in her hands while she says, ""Trust me, I promise I won't screw you over."" I mean that feels wrong like giving a fox the keys to a hen house, I promise I won't eat any.. until I do.

Do you have a source for this? I recently read that during 1941 those households who were affected by the top marginal tax rate paid an effective tax rate north of 70%. I can't locate this article now, but I'd be interested in seeing something contradictory.

That's not 90%, sure, but the tax rate wasn't 90%. That was the *marginal* tax rate on the *highest* bracket, which was over $200,000 at the time, which was tantamount to roughly $2.5 million today. So, yeah, there were people who paid a shit load of their net income as taxes.

Guess what other crazy shit happened in our past, economically-speaking: there were wage freezes; price controls; all sorts of agricultural subsidies, many of which still are in effect today; etc.

And for history, FDR actually tried to push through a 100% tax on every dollar over $25,000 during WWII. I shit you not. And other progressive politicians had even more radical ideas (see Huey Long - he proposed a maximum number of hours a week one could work, maximum salaries, and so on).

I felt the way I did because a) he was unkind to a number of people, which a lot of people overlooked in the wake of his death, b) his death was preventable, if not ridiculously predictable, and c) he suggested heroin to a 16-year-old, rather impressionable friend of mine, as a means of dealing with depression — leading to said friend's own battle with addiction.

I've tried therapy I've tried a range of medicines prescribed to me after I was diagnosed. I can't choose to not be depressed and actually that line of reasoning actually goes against modern science. I have a chemical imbalance that will cause me to go through cycles of being depressed and manic for the rest of my life. I had three separate psychologist who wanted to diagnose me as bipolar when I was 14, but couldn't because you aren't supposed to be diagnosed with something that severe until you'e at least 18. They still started off by putting me on several drugs including lithium. I've been used and abused for most of my life, abandoned by family and people I thought were friends. I DID blame myself for the longest time but after being told by my therapist and people who've proven to be my real family that it wasn't my fault and that I had to learn to stop trying to help every person that  came along (My last therapist jokingly called this my superman complex) I'm trying to come to grips with the fact that I'm not responsible for everything that's happened to me. 

I never got suicidal, I just stopped caring about everything. Recently I thought I'd finally put my life together in some kind of order, I'm married my uncle and brother moved in with me and my wife and they've been the family I never had as a kid. But I started to realize that I never got the chance to figure out what I really wanted to do. A semester away from a bachelors in archaeology I realized I was miserable I didn't really want to do what I was doing and I had a nervous breakdown. Now I can't find a job because it's a small town and the people around here know I'm not Christian. My wife has been supporting me for a month and her birthday is today. Yesterday I sold all of my magic the gathering cards so I could by her a birthday present. I feel like shit. I fill out applications all day for this city and the three nearest ones, and it seems like it's in vain. Since I dropped out of college I can't go to a therapist anymore (it was free there) and I'm literally at my wits end. I realize  now that for the first time in my life I have something to lose and I'm scared. I haven't been scared of anything for so long I don't know how to deal with it. I'm sorry if I'm unloading on you but I just needed to vent this rage somewhere. Even though I know that my current family would never leave me it doesn't get rid of that anxiety or fear, it's a neurosis. It isn't logical and it isn't something I can deal with on my own anymore.

My main problem is in the phrase you used. I don't know that I can change anything anymore, I really don't know what to do or even what I want to do. There aren't options here but I don't have the option to go elsewhere. ","1322698427"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","Lord Amalphous's dark Thetan mask reflected Lafayette Ronald Hubbard's haggard face back at him, but the old man ignored the withered-looking image and concentrated on his opponent.  

""You and the Church have done quite well for yourselves since my escape,"" he mentioned, almost casually moving between the winch controls and the advancing crewmen.  Behind him, he heard the starter for the little boat whine as they attempted to start the engine on the hanging boat.  A few more seconds...

The imposing figure shook his head mightily.  ""No, L. Ron, we just finished what you started.  You built this amazing structure yourself, we simply allowed it to flourish into the amazing creation it is today.  You were foolish to attempt to destroy it, you know.""  

L. Ron waved the uncertain-looking men back as they rapidly figured out who he was.  Just a few more seconds...  He laughed mirthlessly at his berobed opponent.  

""Amalphous...  or little Davie Miscavige as you used to be known, I built this 'church' as a tool for my writing, not so it could become this...""  he gestured around him, ""this monstrosity.  Faking my death was the only way to keep my real family safe, but I wish I had managed to pull this thing apart when I did it.  Little did I know that you and Heber would be so effective at keeping it going.""  

Amalphous/Miscavige chuckled behind his mask.  ""You may not have been serious when you started this, but it is, I assure you, very real now.  Why, we've even built an entirely new type of E-Meter with a completely new effect.  I think that perhaps you'll find it very interesting.""  

Pausing for time and listening to the little starter turn over behind him, L. Ron Hubbard responded with half his attention.  ""Oh yeah?  Where is it?""  Why wouldn't that damn motor start?  

""Why, it's all around us.""  Amalphous gestured at the ship walls, and suddenly Lafayette realized what he was saying.  The heavy-duty masts, the antenna, the ominous round opening near the front of the ex-cruise ship....  

""My god...  you've built it into this ship?  What the hell kind of E-Meter is it?""  

Amalphous burst out laughing at this.  ""Into the ship?  Why doctor, no, you misunderstand.  It IS the ship!  With this new E-Meter, we can perform DIRECT injection of lawsuits in _any jurisdiction in the world_!  The special software onboard allows us to sue thousands, even MILLIONS of people at once!""  

L. Ron Hubbard gaped.  

Behind him, the motor roared to life.  He spun around, waving at the people in the boat.  ""Go, goddamnit!  Get out of here now!""  

Harmon swung the axe he had ready and severed the line holding the horsetackle above him and the boat dropped into the water far below with a splash.  He jumped into the seat up front and firewalled the throttle, sending the deceptively quiet looking boat leaping ahead as the 1,500 horsepower Mercuries blasted.  The little boat shot away from the Freewinds and towards freedom.   

Seeing the boat off, Lafayette Ron Hubbard turned back to Lord Amalphous slowly.  ""You have created...  a terrible evil, David.  You must stop before it's too late, a system like this could cripple the world legal system overnight.""  

David Miscavige shook his head once more.  ""I don't intend to cripple it, Mr. Hubbard.  I intend to _use_ it.  No matter that one little boat got away, we'll catch them in the net of our law system once they touch ground.""

Perhaps, thought L. Ron Hubbard, but then again perhaps not.  For he knew, even if Attendant Amalphous didn't, that the girl being sped to safety was not, in fact, his niece as he had told Harmon earlier.  

The girl was in fact the sister of someone else much more powerful.  

As the hood came down over his head and he was trundled off towards imprisonment belowdecks, L. Ron Hubbard smiled where nobody could see and imagined what 4chan's moot would say when his long-lost sister suddenly showed up. 

He expected it would be memorable, and didn't envy the Church the redoubled efforts of their age-old enemy that would undoubtedly come shortly.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","&gt;So you're telling me if the same HOF QB's voted again they would all of sudden change their mind? You're hilarious

No. I'm saying that some would (Jim Kelly, for example, said that Brady was better but picked Manning due to Brady's knee injury.) More importantly, I'm saying that it doesn't really matter who they picked. They are not talent evaluators, they didn't have their entire careers to look at (and still don't) and their opinion is not gospel as you seem to believe it is.

&gt;Manning did in 15 games and didn't throw pointless garbage time TD's like Brady did late in the 4th quarter. I remember him throwing like 2 yard passes when he had no business being out there.

Please. Show me the garbage time TDs late in the fourth. I'll wait.

&gt;Manning in 2004's voting was 49-1. One guy decides to go against the obvious and Manning gets punished for it.

Perhaps you could complain to Webster's about the definition of ""unanimous?""

&gt;I don't see how Brady can have the highest winning percentage of all time when the Colts had the most wins of the last decade under Manning and Brady entered the NFL in the year 2000.

Not including the playoffs Brady's winning percentage is .773. Staubach is second at .739 and Montana is third at .713.

&gt;I wish people like you would shut the fuck up about him playing a dome or anything weather related. You guys act like he hasn't performed tremendously outdoors before and it's just ignorant. Brady plays better outdoors is because, get this, HE'S USED TO IT.

And I wish people like you would acknowledge that the effects of playing in a dome are real and that anyone who plays in a dome, no matter how good they are, benefits from those effects.

Manning has played plenty of games outdoors, and he's not the same as he is indoors. He's just not. The numbers don't lie. Brady, on the other hand, is. It has nothing to do with ""being used to it,"" it has to do with the ability to throw in the elements. Brady is much better at it.

And it's not like I claim he's never played well outdoors. Of course he has. He's awesome. But on the aggregate he has played much worse outdoors. That's just a fact.

&gt;Manning may of said what he said about the offensive line because he was pissed, but at least he doesn't whine like a little bitch to refs for a flag every time he get's touched.

So just to clarify, you would rather your quarterback blame his performance on the offensive line in the media than complain to a referee for a call? Really? You can't be serious. And if you think Peyton doesn't whine for calls then you haven't been watching. Or perhaps you're forgetting that the league decided to call things differently after your Colts got manhandled in the '04 AFCCG?

&gt;Then you have a guy like Peyton who tells Jim Irsay ""I would like to play for you but if you don't pick me, I will kick your ass for the next 15 years"" and backs up his talk. I couldn't find the video, but I'm sure you've seen it.

And Brady told Kraft that drafting him was the best decision the franchise had ever made. And he was a sixth round pick. Which takes more balls? 

And let's not forget that Brady actually made good on his word. He has been the best decision they made. Manning, on the other hand, claimed he'd play for 15 years and it doesn't look like he'll make it. So no, he didn't back it up.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;Therefore, with the help of Occam's Razor the simplest explanation would be, at least for this argument, that Einstein used the chemicals reactions in his brain to intuit, or think of, these theories rather than posit that some external force/feeling/emotion associated with these brain chemicals are the true cause. 

I am not saying that the ""chemical reactions"" for want of a better term were not involved.  But to say they were the true cause of his insight?  Everyone has the same kind of brain.  The scientists had access to the same data. 

According to you, everyone should have then had the same insight, which is a stretch, especially if you invoke Occam's razor. 

And we know they didn't.

I think our difference here is that you seem to think the chemical reactions are somehow controlling, where as I see them as a theory as to how insights operate when they occur, that provides little  understanding as to when or why.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Sorry, the green revolution did substantially increase yields through the creation of hybrid grain cultivars such as red wheat. The adoption of GMOs made by Monsanto et al. in the last 30 year has not increased yields to the extent of what was achieved by Borlaug in the 50s and 60s.

It's not about any god-given right to farm, simply that Western countries were already ahead of developing countries and so started with a significant trade advantage. Western countries have in the past, and probably continuing today, pursued international litigation through the WTO in response to trade agreements or import tariffs imposed by developing countries which wish to protect their own agricultural industries. 
Furthermore, conditional loans and aid agreements to developing have often included clauses stipulating trades reforms (e.g. IMF structural adjustments) and the implimentation of farming development based on large farms and western monocropping approaches that aren't necessarily appropriate to the local environment.
Local farming is necessary for food security, since food is unequally distributed

A lot of the yield issues in Africa and developing countries have to do with poor soils and unfavourable growing conditions, i.e. droughts etc.. Intensive monocropping which relies only on synthetic fertilizers perpetuated this problem by further reducing soil health. 
Also, Mexico, South Asia and Africa are in the tropics.

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","In a game where you can kill everybody else, the right question is *why not kids*?

I strongly disagree that their immortality lends emotional power to the death of a child, I'd say it's quite the opposite. It's their mortality that gives rise to choice and meaning.

When a dragon burns a town to the ground, people die, including kids. Which of the following scenarios is more powerful?

Scenario 1: You walk through a town strewn by the bodies of the dead. You walk around a corner and see the burnt body of a girl, hugging her burnt teddy bear, huddled in a corner in a vain attempt to hide from the dragon's fiery breath. You walk further down the street, and you see a mother and her child, dead, yet their bodies locked together hand-in-hand.

Scenario 2: You walk through a town strewn by the bodies of the dead. You see kids merrily running around over the bodies of their fathers and mothers as if nothing happened.

Mortality also gives rise to choice--you can now choose to kill, and that death has meaning. If you're role-playing an evil mass-murderer who goes through towns with a scythe, it makes perfect sense that you should be able to murder everybody. What makes kids special? They die like everybody else in real-life. Perhaps even more, in poor countries around the world?

Show me how the kid was cute, lively, fun and kind when he was alive. Show me how his parents loved him and how he loved them back. Show me his room when he's alive, when it's full of toys and traces of life. Then tell me he's dead, and show me *how the world changed*: his devastated parents, his untouched room. Show me the emptiness left behind.

This is actually how we feel in real life, right? Millions of kids die every year (of hunger, abuse, etc.), but it's hard to be moved by distant statistics and numbers, as sad as that is. A kid dying in your circle of life where you can see him before/after, or his parents before/after: that's what really drives it home.

Their mortality also makes your decision not to kill them *meaningful*. A kid did you wrong (stole from you, or hired assassins to kill you) but you let him live.

I remember in Fallout 2, when you visited a town called the Den, there was this merchant in a house. There was a kid beside the door of the merchant's house. As you enter, you'd see a ""pickpocket"" animation on the kid, and if it succeeded, you could find that you're missing some items. Now, here's a post-apocalyptic world where resources are scarce. You just got out of your *dying* village a while back, leaving your tribe for the first time in your life, on a difficult quest to find the holy G.E.C.K. so you may revive your village again. *Lives are at stake*. Every resource counts. And here's a piece of shit *thief* taking that stuff from you when you need it most. What would you do?

If you had the version where kids were visible, you could pickpocket him, or plant a dynamite on him, or just beat him to a pulp and take your stuff out of his dead body. Tough shit, you want to keep your head, don't go around putting your hand where it doesn't belong.

Or you can forgive him and move on. Tough times, life's gone to shit, kid's got to make a living. He was dealt a shit hand but he's making do with what he got, no? Hell, I'm feeling generous, so let me pickpocket him and drop him some good old NCR cash?

Make him immortal, or invisible (which is what Interplay did) and you take away that choice and make it meaningless.","1322698445"

* [Effect of caffeine ingestion after creatine supplementation on intermittent high-intensity sprint performance.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21207054)
&gt;The present study determined that caffeine ingestion after creatine supplements augmented intermittent high-intensity sprint performance.

* [The possible combinatory effects of acute consumption of caffeine, creatine, and amino acids on the improvement of anaerobic running performance in humans.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20934602)
&gt;These findings suggest that the acute ingestion of this preexercise supplement may be an effective strategy for improving anaerobic performance, but appears to have no effect on aerobic power.  

* [Caffeine and creatine use in sport.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21346331)
&gt;Although caffeine and creatine appear to be ergogenic aids, they do so in a sport-specific context and there is no rationale for their simultaneous use in sport.  

(This seems like a really good one to read the full text on.)

* [Caffeine is ergogenic after supplementation of oral creatine monohydrate.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12439084)
&gt;As indicated by a greater [treadmill running to volitional exhaustion], acute caffeine ingestion was found to be ergogenic after 6-d of creatine supplementation and caffeine abstinence.

* [Opposite actions of caffeine and creatine on muscle relaxation time in humans.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11796658)
&gt;It is concluded that Caf intake (3 days) prolongs muscle RT and by this action overrides the shortening of RT due to creatine supplementation.

* [Creatine and caffeine in anaerobic and aerobic exercise: effects on physical performance and pharmacokinetic considerations.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9629989)
...I don't know what this one says about caffeine plus creatine.  :/

* [Caffeine counteracts the ergogenic action of muscle creatine loading.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8929583)
&gt;This ergogenic effect, however, is completely eliminated by caffeine intake.  

(Yikes)

Seems like it's the older studies that are poo-pooing the co-ingestion route.  Perhaps the more modern ones are better designed, I don't know.  The Creatine and Sport review from 2010 is probably your best bet to getting at the answer.   ","1322698450"

When I do hit sync its just to set the tempos the same quick so I can spend more time worrying about fitting the tracks together.

"secretsanta","t5_2rc6h","As a guy that like cooking and gadgets here are my suggestions:

* A mandolin ([1](http://www.amazon.com/Cook-Pro-9-Piece-Mandolin-Slicer/dp/B0047BIVF4/ref=sr_1_12?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322695568&amp;sr=1-12) and [2](http://www.amazon.com/Swissmar-Borner-V-1001-V-Slicer-Mandoline/dp/B0000632QE/ref=sr_1_2?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322695568&amp;sr=1-2) - extremely useful kitchen gadget.  I recommend a V shaped blade over the straight blade, it just cuts better.)

* [A knife sharpener](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_ss_i_2_5?url=search-alias%3Dgarden&amp;field-keywords=knife+sharpener&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;sprefix=knife) (I use an electric one, but any multistage sharpener is a great gift.)

* [Flat whisk](http://www.amazon.com/Orka-Silicone-Whisk-Color-Black/dp/B000VXKQ5U/ref=sr_1_3?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322697264&amp;sr=1-3) (This is very useful for making any sauces, glazes and especially gravies.)

* [Microplane grater](http://www.amazon.com/Microplane-40020-Classic-Zester-Grater/dp/B00004S7V8/ref=sr_1_2?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322697422&amp;sr=1-2) (I got one of these and I have never gone back to my old box grater.  They come in 2 shapes: long and narrow vs wide and short, I prefer the long and narrow.  They come in 3 or 4 'coarseness' levels from zester up to extra-coarse.  I would recommend zest for a first one.)

* [Mini Ramekins](http://www.amazon.com/HIC-6-ounce-Porcelain-Souffle-3-5-inch/dp/B000BI8NAK/ref=sr_1_3?s=kitchen&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322698185&amp;sr=1-3) (A set of these in the size range of 3 to 4 inches or 4 to 6 ounces has a variety of uses: creme brulee, warm cookie or brownie desserts, individual souffles.  But what I use them most for is holding my measured spices together for when I cook.  When I need to dump all my spices onto a heap of cooked meat, I can just dump them on instead of measuring them out one at a time directly onto the meat.)","1322698457"

I disagree.  Kaspersky sucked so much RAM out of my desktop. AVG just brought my comp to a halt when it was running a scan (I had a dual core 2.8, with 4 gigs of RAM. An AV should not do this.) My laptop that I am on now is a 1.6 dual core with 4 gigs of RAM and I have had not a single issue with resources.  I cannot speak for Avast of Trend Micro as I do not remember the last time I messed around with them (maybe on the P4 POS systems we used in networking, but I don't remember if I even used an AV on those.)

Its just that there's no good *word* for those numinous experiences that come from non-mystical revelation.  I've had those kind of ""mind-gasms"" many times, both as a believer and as an atheist.  And, like philhellenes, I've had more of them, and more *powerful* ones, after rejecting the supernatural entirely.

Religion doesn't have a monopoly on awe and wonder.  It isn't fair that it simply steals these amazing moments of humility and connectedness and calls them ""religious experiences"".  Just look at Carl Sagan; the things he wrote were more touching, more glorious than virtually any scripture.  The moment that convinced me to become more openly and vocally an atheist was such a moment, and the biggest thing that hit me was that I don't *need* god to fit into the cosmos.","1322698461"

I've always enjoyed the very long, detail oriented narrative; that may be part of my attraction to McCarthy. I've only read Blood Meridian, The Road and No Country for Old Men and Blood Meridian is definitely the most ""wordy."" My take on the ending is somewhat skewed as I didn't really understand it in the book; I had to turn to a few other sources to get a better handle on what happened and I think even then that it is left to the reader's imagination to really assume what happens. But I think that the Judge's character is supposed to represent MAN his love and respect of war and the law show that his beliefs are thoroughly  rooted in mankind, his belief in a God is absent, if non-existent. So the ending is fitting - this imperfect man, this imperfect species, continues and, as the judge says, will never die. Single men may be sacrificed to the idols of war and violence but the spirit to fight and dominate endures. I found it to be a great read, but definitely quite dense so I can see how it would be a tough read. ","1322698464"

I dunno, I'm not a psychologist, but I'm sure there is some logical reasoning behind it. 

The best logical reason is probably that many women have a tendency to place more value on living things (biology, medicine, care, people-skills, communications, relations, psychology, sociology, art/dance etc), rather than abstract concepts (math/engineering/physics/science).  Which would explain the ratios in universities---but many sociologists say that it's because of societal engineering from a young age and conditioning by parents ('you are gonna be a princess or a great mother when you grow up.' rather than with boys 'you are gonna be an astronaut, firemen, brilliant scientist, football pro player').

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I understand the basis of the confusion.  On some level, you're right, more stimulation to an individual muscle = more potential stimulus for growth.

However, it's a forest/trees thing.  You're not aiming for ""as much stimulation as possible,"" you're aiming for ""the least stimulation necessary as often as possible.""  This is the fundamental confusion with the bodybuilder approach - the idea of infrequently ""blasting"" muscles is at odds with approximately all research into the subject of growing/gaining strength.  Steroids do change the equation (they turn growth to ""on,"" at which point you become a food processor with lifting to help maximize said gains), but aren't relevant for naturals.

So the advantage of full body routines is that, by focusing on big, compound lifts, you are doing ""enough"" to stimulate most of the major musculature often, growing and getting stronger as quickly as possible.  At some point, to grow further or get stronger, more work may be required (i.e. dose/response favors a bigger dose of the ""medicine"" of exercise), and there are different ways to approach this, including splitting things up.

But for a beginner, you're just doing enough to stimulate using the most efficient exercises possible for this purpose (big, compound movements).  We ""know"" this works both from research and anecdote.  Give it an honest try, and eat enough to support your goals.","1322698478"

All the pins are broken out and labelled as they are named when you program in straight C/C++.

There are a lot of examples and libs written in the Arduino language though and sometimes it is worth jumping back into that if you want some quick results. You don't have to use the IDE though as there are Makefiles that process, link, compile and upload the sketch files like the IDE does.","1322698478"

How is my logic flawed again?

Your example is a strawman. Since TEST and Goons are blue to each-other, redditors often use the term Pubbie to refere to non-redditors and non-goons. So your example doesn't apply. My point simply is, if you're a redditor you should not be using the term to describe non-redditors as it's clearly confusing and doesn't mean what you think it means.","1322698492"

What I mean about your mind playing tricks on you is things like, for example, when you are in a pitch black room for long enough, your mind begins to see light that really isn't there. (google it, there is some name for it, as it used to happen to trapped miners a lot, but I can't remember it) So let's say you're a kid and you can't sleep and your room is dark. You lay there awake starting into the darkness. You see some green light or weird shadows. If you believe in demons, then you're going to think it's demons. If you are logical and rational and do some research, you see that it's just your brain over compensating for a lack of stimulus.

An example, [here](http://gizmodo.com/5092869/headphones-playing-white-noise-and-a-ping-pong-ball-let-you-trip-sans-drugs). THIS is what I mean when I say, ""Our minds are great at fucking with us.""

I love some of the venues around Fitzroy, but I can see a lot of them heading the way of the Birmingham (crn Smith and Johnson) and closing the band room then turning it into a dining/function space. I don’t begrudge venues for heading this way, its local government and liquor licensing that makes it hard to keep operating a live music venue. 

It takes years for an area to develop, but I’d love to see the live music scene/alternative community take a stake on a new area and stand its ground.

You would have to assume that World War 2 got its name near the start.  Although, people writing about WWI probably discussed the possibility of another world war before it happened.  So WWII, while it was still theoretical, could be argued to have been named before it happened.

None of the current wars has ever been popularly referred to as World War III.

They also brought in Jeff Imada for the fight scenes, hence the reduction of the Krav Maga you see in the first one.  Jeff Imada is primarily known for knife fighting techniques, and more martial arts than the killer style that is Krav.  Krav is all about disabling and killing quickly.

That being said, I find myself more open to the possibility that I am wrong than most people on here (a characteristic I thought would be more prevalent in a forum about skepticism).

Taking your example, even *if* the egg actually *did* tell me I was the son of god and that a giant yolk in space will destroy the Earth in 35 days - you wouldn't accept my claim, simply because it is too extraordinary and unverifiable. And I'd probably respond the same way, unless I really knew and trusted the person telling me the story. 

At the same time, however justified our reactions are, they don't reflect what actually happened. 

I guess my main point is extraordinary things are *possible*, and for that reason I wish we would be a little more open to different people's viewpoints. I'm by no means a relativist, but I do believe that sometimes people have different experiences and knowledge than others. And despite their inability to share these experiences and knowledge with other people, it doesn't make them any less true. ","1322698510"

I think rather than try to improve the way we interface with the game (mouse + keyboard really can't be beaten, and controllers aren't *too* far behind), I think we should focus more on how the game interfaces with *us* via biofeedback and the like.

This hypothesis is not really backed by hard data too. In data for many historical cases of deflationary crysis (like great depression) it can be clearly seen, that increased government spending, even if it is not always enough to start long term growth, definitely does provide short term benefits.

But the shorter/steepest ones are the worse - like the upstairs you see on the video (there is actually another set of stairs even longer/steeper/more irregular). Not many people run in there because they are irregular steps, usually it's humid in there (and slippery). There also ladders and rocky parts where you use your hands to climb up or down. Once I saw an older man (like 65 years old +) who powerwalked the entire course, barely stopped on checkpoints and completed it just under 20hrs. The winners do that in anything from 9 to 12 hrs.

Disagreeing with someone out-loud, criticizing their beliefs, and mocking stupidity are not inherently bad ideas. Otherwise history and physics teachers would also be as bad as fundamentalists. It's not the style of conveying the message that's important, it's the content.

Two, Darabont has been involved with all episodes aired so far. From the second half of the second season onwards he hasn't be involved.

The skills that got you to FM will translate very well. You've learned:

* How to break a messy system into simple concepts, and how to apply those concepts to your decisionmaking

* How to learn and make the best use a set of opening moves, and how to transition out of them

* How to analyze your games and those of grandmasters, and how to transform your observations into improvements in your play

But more than anything, you've *learned how to learn*. That's a skill you can use to become an expert at Starcraft. Or to become an expert at managing hundreds of millions of dollars: http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/09/29/good-at-chess-a-hedge-fund-may-want-to-hire-you/

And, if nothing else, it should give you confidence. Rock on.

"law","t5_2qh9k","when software kiddies are all on their own (or just a cog at a company), IP sounds super evil.  but when you get involved in investor relations and/or business strategy, there's always the question of ""what competitive advantages do you have?""  the only real competitive advantages are IP, personal relationships (i.e. your VP of sales is sleeping with the buyer's VP of purchasing), and theft-resistant trade secrets.  things that are NOT competitive advantages: money, human resources, a head start.

so my experience is that talking to the &lt;25 crowd, they're always super anti-IP, but talking to the &gt;35 crowd, they're usually pro-IP.  (although i don't mean the RIAA version of IP where they want to be able to seize your home, shoot your dog, and lock you up in prison for life... for downloading some songs).","1322698520"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The type of ""instant gratification"" you are talking about is called *reinforcement*. Reinforcement (very broadly) is about getting some type of reward when you perform a behaviour (e.g. check reddit, or perhaps wait for upvotes) and when you get that reward (e.g. see a funny page, get an upvote) it makes it more likely that you will continue engaging in the behaviour and so on. 

This type of reinforcement is very much applied to the study of addictions of all types and we absolutely do know that in those contexts (e.g. gambling addiction), there are changes in the wiring of the brain. 

With that said, I think you are then asking whether we might be able to see the same brain changes in Reddit users that we might see in other addictions. I will refer you [to another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/lyqhz/how_does_a_psychological_addiction_work/) with a similar question for some further information about this. Long story short is that based on the principles of Reinforcement, it is very possible that there may be brain changes occurring, however brain changes and rewiring is happening *all the time* so there is no need to worry about this being a bad thing. It is just the brain going about it usual adaptation and learning. It only becomes a problem if you become ""addicted"" to the behaviour (explained in the link). Sure it is possible that the brains of younger generations may be wired differently, but there is no reason to suggests that each generation has their own unique re-wiring based on the experiences of people within those generations.","1322698521"

pretty much...truth is, most causal gamers don't play LoL because the games on SR and TT are an hour long. i bet riot wants to expose people to dominion so first-timers know they have the option of dominion...

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I find the easiest method would be to envision the situation. Even though physics is not immediately intuitive, the beauty behind kinematics and mechanics, is that it is simple math applied to logical every day life occurrences. Think first on how you would differentiate between (looking at the math) between both types of collisions. Elastic collisions are not overly realistic, unless it is a very large object colliding with a very small one. So think about it. How could an object hit another without change in kinetic energy or momentum. Well if m1 was very high lets say, and m2 very small, than m3 would be pretty much the same size as m1, therefore there would be no change. That is why in many questions such as this you would be given set constraints on it. Ie, momentum is constant, mass is significantly greater etc. Now, for inelastic collisions, that is an approach more ""real"". Inelastic collisions, are as it says: collisions. When you think of things colliding, there must be a definite transformation of energy. Now, the major thing I did to make this seem logical to me was again comparing the two. Generally, in an inelastic collision you would compare the masses. http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/inecol.html#c1. I think that sums up the last part well. I find this level of physics is very conceptual, try and break it down into layman's terms for yourself in order to understand it. They might be trying to trick in you the question stem, but the actual physics is logical and right there for you to apply. Hope this somewhat helps. ","1322698526"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I justify it in several ways:

1) I'm supporting a company that makes something I enjoy. I'm voting with my wallet. As long as they keep making stuff I enjoy I keep spending money.

2) I regularly spend money on other superfluous things like cigarettes, snacks, liquor. The way I see it, giving up 1 pack of cigarettes buys me a skin ($4.50 where I live).

3) Sometimes people tell me I'm buying nothing or at best a memory as  everything belongs to Riot. I always reply that the same applies to every single piece of food I've ingested that has been above the nourishment threshold. All has been dutifully converted to poop and all I have left is a memory and maybe some nice farts.

The justifications actually are extensive if we compare the act of buying RP to other things in life. I feel it's a perception issue people have with spending money on 'virtual goods'.

Necessary for success depends on your definition. I feel that one can do quite well in this game without having even to farm a 3k ip champ. Beastly champs like Alistar or Tristana are even free. I really appreciate the fact that in this game a cheap champ does not mean a gimped champ, not in the slightest. Then again some people think they _need_ to be able to play Fitz and Volibear on demand to succeed. In the end it boils down to patience and free time. Even runes which are the worst grind this game has to offer have not been all that bad and I only bought boosts when I was sub30. 

I've spent around $40 on the 2 bundles with 20 champs each, $20 on the 7 rune page bundle (the only purchase I've hated with all my heart because I feel it's the only thing I've spend money on that's not fun but useful.), ~$100 on rp that I've spent on champs and skins. Also bought a Riot Singed as a gift for the friend that got me into the game and a rune page bundle for another friend that I'm trying to get into the game.

You can't judge the distant past with your set of morals because they just don't fit. Hundreds of years from now there will be things our society does, probably things YOU do, that they will think 'Oh my that's horrible, WHY?'

For example, how could you use fossil fuels? What's wrong with you? You're literally helping people develop cancer! You see, you CAN judge people on their actions based on society of the day.

as for number #1, by nothing I mean literally nothing not even a dimension. I've never heard of virtual particles but I assume they are appearing in 3 dimensional space, which would not exist if there is just nothing.  

So at one point there was nothing - then something or there was always something. How could there just always be something? From my view this is just as impossible because it goes against cause and effect.

Defensively we didn't wake up until it was 2-0. Bassong and Corluka in particular were just woeful, with Gallas not covering himself in glory either.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The molecules on the surface of any two objects attract each other with an extremely small amount of force. The amont of force is different for different pairs of objects (which gives rise to different coefficients of friction), but some always exists. The amount of friction would then depend on the amount of force between two molecules, and the surface area in contact. The surface area in contact isn't equal to the entire area of the objects that is in contact though, surfaces have microscopic projections and depressions on them, which reduce the effective area of contact. The reason extremely smooth surfaces have a large amount of friction is that because the contact area is much larger (imagine the area of contact between the projected side of a lego block vs the smooth size of a lego block). The slippery nature of smooth polished surfaces though is due to the lubricating nature of the polish, which effectively reduces inter-molecular attraction.","1322698547"

I could go on. They also experiment a hell of a lot with individual songs - can you imagine Coldplay writing a song like ""Fitter Happier"", ""Pulk-Pull Revolving Doors"" or even ""Kid A""? Coldplay also employ far more traditional lyrics in their music, again, shying away from difference.","1322698558"
"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Okay, I try this one last time. I know you have the reading comprehension of a gerbil with Down's Syndrome, but do try and keep up. 

Ganks are fucking Awesome. You love 'em, I love 'em, they make the game exciting, and there's a definite rush when you come roaring in from behind their turret with Rammus and start wrecking face. However, as with everything in life, there is a price for these lovely ganks. Good ganks are planned out, you don't just run into a lane and start throwing your abilities around willy-nilly. Time is invested, in communicating with your laner, getting into position, and waiting for the right moment to unleash your fury on the enemy. 

Prior to these changes to the jungle, you had the time to spend. Your jungle was clear, you didn't see a need to invade enemy jungle, your neutral objectives are secure, and no lane needs you to cover. Spending a minute camping a bush was worth the gank, succeed or fail, because even if it all goes south and you die, you as the jungler really only lose more time, which as we've already discussed, you have plenty of. 

Now things have changed. Now by sitting that bush a minute, you're missing out on not one, but two spawns of your camps (assuming you clear before you go camp), and with the jungle no longer providing the XP and gold income on it's own to let you keep up in levels and items with everyone else, you need that gank to succeed just to pay for the time you spent on it. If it fails and you die, you're now in serious trouble. Remember, camps now retain their value based on when they spawn. So if I blow 3 minutes with a failed gank that ends in my death (totally reasonable with travel time, respawn clock and camping the bush) my entire jungle is going to be 3 minutes behind in terms of value, which means even less XP and gold to make up for the time lost while ganking. 

So with all that in mind, the cost of ganking now outweighs the rewards. The risk is incredibly high now with what I, as the jungler, can lose, and the rewards have not changed at all to balance that. I'm very sure that a lane with a couple ganks will rape it's laning opponent, but now after those couple ganks, regardless of their success, I'm going to be underleveled and underfarmed and just get shit on when it comes to teamfights. 

Now obviously there's exceptions. Shaco is always going to get shit on once teamfights start, and if you go like 7-0 while everyone is still in lane, then you're going to rape people regardless, but in the average game, where you start teamfighting at 2-1-1 or 1-2-3, you will find yourself much, much, MUCH weaker than if you had just stayed in that jungle and farmed your ass off. And hey, if the enemy team is being retarded and overextending all day long, absolutely go punish them for it, but if you plan your game around the enemy being bad, then you're going to make mistakes and lose games when you stop running into bads. You can't go into a game expecting bad play from your opponents, you go in expecting them to play perfectly, and then react to their mistakes. Expecting bad play only makes you play bad. 

In conclusion, while there's no argument that ganks are the LoL equivalent of having a one-night stand with a chick who says ""Why yes, I love anal"", the risk involved in the new jungle makes it no longer worth doing unless you know you can come through without being too far behind. What I'm trying to say is that if ganks are hot chicks into casual anal sex, the new jungle is AIDS. ","1322698558"

It's pretty obvious that he thinks he was just doing what he was supposed to do.  I am not your fan, but I am not going to argue that what he did was right, so I disagree with him, but I think that is what he's thinking.

At this point he's probably absolutely furious with you and wondering what kind of other thing you are going to get involved with that will cause this to be on national TV again, and just wishing you'd shut up, so the death threats will stop.

You basically destroyed him.  You got him on national TV repeatedly, and people like me are reading affidavits from your mother where she accuses him of Barbie doll abuse and getting STD's from Mexican hookers, when it's really not anyone's business.  Expecting a groveling apology after that is very wishful.  Things can't get any worse for him, so it's not like it will take any pressure off.  And I think that if you persist in trying to concentrate the forces of the internet against him, you'll end up looking progressively more vindictive.  Anyone who believes that this has anything to do with ""helping"" him, if it ever did, and it may have originally, is naive.  Eventually you'll exhaust the national attention span and you'll associate yourself with him as the daughter who ground her father into the dirt with YouTube.

"LosAngeles","t5_2qht0","A lot of LA auditions these days are improv based(especially commercial auditions). Instead of a typical reader/auditionee setup they might bring in 1 actor for each part and have you play the scene through improv. A lot of actors still get really hung up about learning a scene for an audition and don't know how to hold the sides in their hand and act at the same time, so improv removes that element. (although I do have my fair share of regular auditions with sides) Margie's school is EXCELLENT for teaching you to work with the sides in your audition rather than trying to cram the lines into your brain for no reason.

I know some people have a major hard on for Meisner. I think that's an element that varies by the person and your previous training. If it's something you want to connect with definitely go for it. Each market is different and value different styles of training so it depends on your goals. I went to a classical theatre conservatory in the UK which covered my movement, breath, voice and text work but I really needed to brush up on my on-camera when I got here.

I think you'll find that many of the schools here are a bit more Mamet in their approach to saying the lines. Reactions to what is happening rather than getting upset about your dog running away is more believable and a lot easier for people to master so although many people still love to use elements of method acting it's not as popular as it once was.

I don't have any experience with the Actor's Studio. The places I checked out before settling on Margie Haber was The Edgemar Studio (formerly Larry Moss school) and Warner Laughlin.

Larry Moss school has a real SCHOOL feel to it. I liked them a lot and they have an in house theatre troupe. For me I felt it was a bit too basic since I already have solid conservatory training. Warner Laughlin was REALLY nice and she has a very family feel with her students, but the class you audit is the advanced group so it was hard to know what the actual intro levels might be.

Don't go to Ivana Chubbuck unless you want to watch a diva prance around the room in front of you.

But hair changes what it likes a lot of the time, and one thing it used to hate it will crave it again suddenly. So I went back to shampooing before conditioning, but with sulfate-free shampoo, and that worked. But within the last few months it's just been benign neglect and I've used whatever shampoo and conditioner I want, mostly with sulfates. So maybe I've re-untrained my hair to go back to craving sulfates and I need to ween off them again.

But my husband just does whatever with his, but has the same issues. I wish I could go without washing my hair every (work) night but it looks terrible and I have to look nice at work. So yeah. At least it's not all in my head and you've noticed it, too!","1322698576"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","&gt; You're asking me what I would do.

In the real world.  I'm not interested in an economic vacuum chamber.

&gt; Your naming problems government causes ...

Unemployment has existed long before government.  As has poverty, homelessness, and human suffering.  Show me a time period in which a non-government populace lived in blissful utopia, and maybe your argument will carry more weight.

&gt;&gt; Its not like ""the jobs"" have a giant neon sign hovering over them.

&gt; They do. In fact, some businesses have ads to hire people precisely to produce neon signs that say ""Now Hiring"". 

If you put up an ad in a local newspaper or hang a ""Now Hiring"" sign in your business window in Topeka, Kansas no one in Hartford, Connecticut is going to see it.  The ""just move"" argument doesn't address *where* to move or what jobs will be available when you get there.

&gt; And then there's statistics. It's one reason people are moving to Houston.

Houston is the epicenter of a number of major corporations.  As a Houston resident myself, I can tell you why we moved here.  My father's job transferred him here.  I have dozens of friends with parents who told the same story.  People move to Houston because their companies tell them to move to Houston, not because they were just leafing through the ""Help Wanted"" ads in Saint Louis or Denver and saw ""Job opening in H-town"".

&gt;&gt; So how does this fix the problem of an unemployed 50-year-old.

&gt; He can retire early and live off his savings, or get a job.

The problem is unemployment.  If ""live off your savings or get a job"" were options, there would be no problem.  I pray you are not a doctor.  I can totally hear your medical advice:  ""You're sick?  Oh man, I know exactly what you should do.  You should get well again.""

&gt;&gt; Only if businesses transfer the savings to the customers.

&gt; Which they have to, because other businesses will undercut them with the same gain in efficiency in order to increase profits.

All the businesses are held to the same standard of math.  If there is no financial gain in a price drop, businesses won't reduce their prices.  And if no one reduces price, there is no incentive for neighbors to match the reduction to compete.  There are equilibrum price states at which point no one benefits from a price reduction.  If I sell widgets for $10 and you sell widgets for $10, we both recognize that neither of us benefit by lowering the price to $9 since we're both still working out of the same market.  So we collude, fix prices among each other, and prices stay where they are.

&gt; You have this Marxian view

Whatever.  If you're just going to fling around ad hominem attacks, you're not actually interested in discussion are you?  Why even respond if you're just going to go out with ""Marxist!  Marxist!  You're a Marxist!"" in an attempt to end all debate?

&gt;&gt; You want to argue that the free market is always pareto optimal, but there are numerous real life scenarios in which this is not true.

&gt; Go ahead and mention one. Just try. Give me your BEST SHOT

A classic example is ""The Tragedy of the Commons"".

Assume three farmers are working a field.  Each farmer owns 5 cows, and the land they occupy can support no more than 10 cows, after which overfeeding will kill too much grass and the land will be worthless.

Optimally, two farmers would feed 3 cows and one would feed 4, then and slaughter the rest.  However, no farmer benefits from allowing his neighbor to feed on the last patch of grass.  Assuming all the farmers are rational and selfish, there are two possible outcomes:

1. All three farmers leave an extra cow alive and attempt to feed on the last patch of grass.  The land is overfeed and rendered useless.  All the cows die.

2. All three farmers kill their neighbors' 4th and 5th cow, the prevent overfeeding, and the last patch of grass goes fallow.

The Pareto Optimal Outcome (4/3/3) can't be reached because each independent actor will either overfeed or prevent his neighbors from overfeeding.

Another example is the Exxon Valdez.  The Valdez crashes into the Alaskan coast.  Exxon has absolutely no economic incentive to clean up the mess - it does not financially benefit from the Alaskan coast.  The Alaskan natives have ever reason to clean up the coast - it is the foundation of their fortunes.  The Pareto Optimal Outcome - one in which Exxon restores enough of the coast such that their expenses are superseded by the natives' recovery - is not one pursued by either party.  Exxon seeks to minimize the damages it incurs.  

Sans legal system, Exxon simply refuses to pay damages even if the payment will restore the cost and yield more economic growth/recovery than leaving the land destroyed.  This is preferable for Exxon but not Pareto Optimal, assuming each $1 Exxon would pay in coastal recovery would generate more than $1 in the pockets of the coastal natives.  Exxon has nothing to gain by paying damages to a wronged party.","1322698580"

Yes and no. They maintain control over their own data and model, without releasing it outside it's organization. Therefore it's really one entity for most purposes. 

&gt; In any case, I'm not going to the IPCC, I'm going to the original authors, to read the original research articles.

Chances are you're not. Those authors are likely just repeating what the IPCC has sent out to be reported. They do this to provide a united front without decent or controversy. In other words, it wasn't an accident that ""all experts agree"", it was constructed that way on purpose.

&gt; The fact that they underestimate is that the situation is even further from your own position than the IPCC will publicly state.

if the IPCC knew what was causing global warming, then they should be able to create an accurate model. Clearly there is something they don't understand.

&gt; It's not about fucking taxes, it's about the world your kids and grandkids will live in.

Thats the fear mongering playing with your mind. They use fear to get you to be their slave. Nothing you have presented here is a threat to hardly any human. A polar bear might have a reason to worry, but not a human.

&gt; Please learn some fucking science before continuing to spout idiocies on the subject.

"japan","t5_2qh2u","&gt;demonstrates far more radiation has been released than admitted to by the Japanese government

I am not sure why you use ""admitted"", which implies some sort of cover-up, when clearly they state there are errors introduced with their estimations. In [Chapter 4 section VI](http://www.iaea.org/newscenter/focus/fukushima/japan-report/) Report of Japanese Government to IAEA Ministerial Conference on Nuclear Safety.

&gt;However, the simulation does not always guarantee the actual measured values of 
concentration themselves because it is a model that predicts distribution, not one that 
predicts the level of the concentration itself. In addition, differences between the distribution 
and the actually measured values are caused by that fact that errors become bigger as the 
predictive time gets longer, due to multiple restrictions including the impossibility of 
thorough reproduction of the actual flow even by incorporating observed values into the 
model, together with the generation of errors by using average winds of the period after 
using winds for estimation for about a week only. There is a need to perform constant 
reviews to realize estimates that are far closer to the real values, checking actually measured 
values of the latest monitoring results and obtaining a mutual evaluation on simulations by 
other calculation codes, too.

Finally to go back to the original quote I used it seems fitting to use it again.

Which means that the split of damage for a BH would be ~ 75% MH, 25% OH, but the total would net the same.

For those who aren't aware, if you like a particular weapon's look, and it has all the mod slots available to an item in that armor slot (like this pistol has all 4 available to a pistol) it can be upgraded to any quality or level.  If you are raiding and find an upgrade, but don't like the way it looks, you can pay to have all the mods removed from an item and then place those mods in another item, provided the item you are targeting is fully upgradeable (green quality items usually are not, but every blue/purple I've seen typically is).  The Rating is determined, I believe, by the Barrel of a gun and armoring of an item (truthfully, I have no idea what it is for a lightsaber), so simply by putting a new barrel in the gun above, I could update it's damage range and any stats associated with the Barrel mod (and update the others seperately as well).  The numbers in parenthesis to the right of the mod slot, ie ""Barrel (36)"", is the level requirement for that particular mod (I was level 38 at the time of this screenshot, and got this particular gun from the commendations vendor on Taris).

&gt;""It would be safe to say that I'm agnostic. However, I do feel as though we owe a faith to the world and to ourselves. We owe a grace and gratitude to things that have brought us here. But I think it's very ignorant to say, ""Well, for everything, God has a plan."" That's like an excuse. ... Maybe the real faithful act is to commit to something, to take action, as opposed to saying, ""Well, everything is in the hand of God."" - Boston Globe Mar. 4, 2001

and then about politicians:

&gt;Yeah, ""get out of my way so I can get into the church."" It’s so small a view of things. Obviously, there’s a source of all things, however big or small it is. But if you give it consciousness, it just gets smaller. If you give it concern for us, it gets smaller.

&gt;I use the word ""God"" in my songs all the time, because I don’t know what the hell is going on. So that’s God – everything I don’t know. But the idea of God as a fatherly figure who looks down on us and worries about how we’re doing or takes sides when we have fights – it’s more irritating than Santa Claus. The world and the universe are far more wonderful if there’s not a puppet master. - Rolling Stone

"violinist","t5_2sbn3","AudioTechnica Pro 7a, discontinued for years, still works great. 

Goes through a battery about once every presidential administration.  
Been dropped any number of times.

The 7a was originally designated an instrument mic, then they started calling it a vocal lavalier and steering the musicians to, hmm, was it the 250? Which was of course much pricier. 

As far as I can tell, it's been supplanted by the 70, marketed for vocal/guitar at ~$120. There's also the 35, but that only comes as needs-phantom-power, and I hate what happens in live nonprofit venues when a volunteer does stupid things with phantom power on...

If you do a search for ""violin mic"", AT will tell you all about the atm250 which I'm sure is excellent at ~$450, but if you're always playing in live venues with crowd noise, how clean of a response curve do you need? If I'm playing something exquisite for a crowd holding it's breath, I'm playing acoustic in a good hall, and if I'm recording there's usually someone involved with a lot stronger opinions (and way better equipment) than me.

Oh, and DON't get that flat velcro violin clip thing. It points the mic in the wrong direction.

Best bet I've found is pointed down at the faceplate, right behind the bridge, as close in as you can get. The Unimount gooseneck works great clipped to my particular chinrest -- it's a center type, and I can actually get the mic under the strings without touching anything -- but I've also seen folks get good results by simply hollowing out a slot for the mic in a chunk of windscreen foam and stuffing it under the strings.

After looking long and hard at the stats, my interpretation (and there are others) is that it is extremely unlikely that you will ever have a chance to use them to defend yourself. It is slightly more likely (though still extremely rare) that you will hurt yourself or someone you know. 

Furthermore, I think the real reason the majority of people want guns is, because they're fun. And I don't even have a problem with that. However, I think there needs to be limits.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In many of the cases, the woman were ""owned"" by the men who were enslaving them, forced to live in cramped, unsanitary quarters and eat whatever was provided for them, which was rarely enough. Most of them were stolen from their homes or villages and had no say in the men who got to have sex with them. In contrast, a prostitute might get a cut of the money, generally provides her own housing and meals, and often gets to turn down tricks. These enslaved women had no say in their treatment or what acts were performed on them, either, so they could be beaten at will.

It depends on the woman, how they escape. One woman talked about being forced to stay locked in an apartment several stories up (I can't remember how many) and one day her slaver forgot to lock a window and she jumped and broke her leg, but she escaped. Other women find opportunities to run away, but run the risk of being hunted down and killed. Still others are rescued when the police or humanitarian organizations shut down their owner's practice.","1322698640"

We have daily meetings on progress, date changes on certain tasks, etc.  We also use this to discuss additional features and things like that.  I have been very open minded from the start, as I know that just because the product sounds great to me, doesn't mean it's perfect.  Fortunately I have been blessed with a great team that provides great feedback and also doesn't get butt-hurt or demoralized if I have to shoot an idea down.

I really appreciate the advice about dictating.  My typical method of managing them is giving direction, then requesting their opinion/feedback about that direction regarding time estimate, difficulty, etc.  Then, if I feel they aren't exhilarating or giving me a ""coder time"", we meet in the middle or I just stand firm with what I feel needs to happen.

"wow","t5_2qio8","Guides are tailored to max level.  At max level, Discipline and Holy priests perform the same role (healer) in different ways.  

Holy is focused on group heals, heal over time effects and has a nice toolbox to deal with these things.  This spec reacts to damage as it comes in.

Discipline focuses on mitigating damage through PW:Shield and Divine Aegis, and PW:Barrier.  This spec anticipates damage influx and mitigates it accordingly.

At max level, your mana will become much more important than it is now.  Its strange to think about, but Healers at max level look at how much spells heal per mana used.

An 85 holy priest can cast a shield, but he doesnt have the talents that make it absorb more or refund mana when popped like disc does, so its actually more mana efficient for the holy priest to cast a renew instead and react to the damage, rather than anticipate and mitigate it like a disc priest would.

If you are really committed to shielding your party as a tactic, at 85 you will want to be disc.  For leveling it wont matter as much because mana efficiency is not an issue.  If you try to shield your party as Holy at 85, you will run yourself out of mana and struggle to keep everyone alive.

If you can afford it (and it sounds like your parents can subsidize you), you won't regret going to college. If food is your gig, get a degree you can apply to the catering industry later down the line -something business related for example - that way you can apply those learnt skills to your real passion but still have a vocational backup.

Take part time work in a kitchen as soon as you're old enough. Do that while in college, coupled with a good degree and you'll be in great stead to live out your passion further down the line - without putting all your eggs in one basket just yet.

I can't be bothered to find individuals sources but there are a few textbooks cited there. The rest is conjecture and discussion with a biology professor who currently teaches medicine. We both agree that due to the way the anus works stretching the sphincter is a bad idea. Flesh and skin aren't perfectly elastic and don't return to their original form after serious stretching, and that's not even factoring in actual damage, I'm only talking about super-safe completely lubricated slow anal stretching. The sphincter needs to be able to close tightly, to have that elastic quality, to better keep the fecal matter inside the anus.

Bourbon whiskey derives its name from the original Bourbon County, which in 1786 covered most of what is now northeastern Kentucky but was still part of Virginia. The area later became known as Old Bourbon in reference to its historical expanse. Whiskey was an early product of the area, and whiskey barrels from the area were marked Old Bourbon when they were shipped downriver from the local port on the Ohio River.[7][8] As it was made mostly from corn (maize), it had a distinctive flavor, and the name bourbon came to be used to distinguish it from other regional whiskey styles, such as Monongahela, a product of western Pennsylvania, which may have generally been a rye whiskey. The use of the term Old in the phrase Old Bourbon, was likely misconstrued as a reference to the aging of the whiskey rather than part of the name of the geographic area.[7] The port, originally known as Limestone, now Maysville, was in Bourbon County until the borders were redrawn in 1789 when it became part of the Mason County of Virginia, and it is now in Mason County, Kentucky.[7] Thirty-four modern Kentucky counties were once part of the original Bourbon County, including the current county of that name.[9]","1322698673"

"BDSMcommunity","t5_2r9tk","This is very true, and very helpful.  By sexualizing the chore you not only make it better for her (it's now two acts of service instead of one), but you're also giving yourself another means of enjoying it.  Fun things you can do:

1)  Have her do a chore while wearing a butt plug.

2)  Have her do a stationary chore (like the dishes) while a vibrator is buzzing inside her.  She has to keep it inside without touching it, and every time it drops there's a punishment.

3)  Give her a chore and a time.  The rule is that she must complete the chore and reach an orgasm at that time.  If she's late or early in orgasming on time then she gets punished an amount equivalent to the time differential.  So for example if she finishes and orgasms five minutes early then she has to keep an ice cube inside her for five minutes.  Or if she's two minutes late then she has to keep a Hitachi on full power pressed against her clit for that timeframe.

4)  Have her wash you in the shower.  I've suggested this a few times to different couples and it's gone over well.  While she washes you in the shower one of her hands must be fingering her pussy at all times.  Any time she stops she gets a punishment.  You can also combine this with washing her in a manner that makes her feel owned, like you're just washing her as an excuse to feel her up.  ","1322698678"

"geology","t5_2qshr","I work in a lab that analyses organic molecules in rocks (""organic geochemistry"") and you should be aware that absolutely nobody in the field takes the idea of ""deep petroleum"" seriously. Porphyrins (organic molecules derived from chlorophyll and hence life) were discovered by a guy named Treibs in oils back in the 1930's, so we've know about this for a while. There's a reason that the ""Deep Hot Biosphere"" theory was invented by a physicist and that the ""deep petroleum"" article was published in an Indian journal most people have never heard of...

Most organic molecules produced by hydrothermal systems are very simple (four-carbon butane is the most complex molecule in the ""Seafloor Chemistry"" article above) or produced in extremely low concentrations. Also, the few places where oil was trapped in igneous rocks, those rocks were either faulted or erupted over sedimentary source rocks (e.g. I believe there's oil under the Columbia river basalts). As an pretty awesome aside, there are [microbes inside 2.8 kilometer deep igneous rocks](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/322/5899/275) that can live off of the hydrogen produced by radiation inside those rocks.

Which is not to say that tholins (the organic molecules on Titan) didn't potentially play [an important role earlier in Earth's history](http://geology.geoscienceworld.org/content/29/11/1003.abstract). Or that places like Lost City weren't important in producing organic matter earlier in Earth's history: a very trace amount of organic matter produced by a hydrothermal vent can build up to be quite a bit over tens of millions of years. It's just that there are several forms of organic matter and there's no evidence that non-biological forms have accumulated in any significant amount for billions of years.","1322698682"

&gt;While Fed officials say that almost all of the loans were repaid and there have been no losses, details suggest taxpayers paid a price beyond dollars as **the secret funding helped preserve a broken status quo and enabled the biggest banks to grow even bigger.**

Also, the banks were basically lying to everyone about their financial health.  This isn't free markets.  People can't make informed decisions about governance and society when these kinds of secrets are kept.

&gt;On Nov. 26, 2008, then-Bank of America (BAC) Corp. Chief Executive Officer Kenneth D. Lewis wrote to shareholders that he headed “one of the strongest and most stable major banks in the world.” He didn’t say that his Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm owed the central bank $86 billion that day.

&gt;The secrecy extended even to members of President George W. Bush’s administration who managed TARP. Top aides to Paulson weren’t privy to Fed lending details during the creation of the program that provided crisis funding to more than 700 banks, say two former senior Treasury officials who requested anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak.

&gt;“The Fed is the second-most-important appointed body in the U.S., next to the Supreme Court, and we’re dealing with a democracy,” Jones says. “Our representatives in Congress deserve to have this kind of information so they can oversee the Fed.”

Also, the most damning of all is the moral hazard involved with this MASSIVE bailout:

&gt;Kaufman says some banks are so big that their failure could trigger a chain reaction in the financial system. **The cost of borrowing for so-called too-big-to-fail banks is lower than that of smaller firms because lenders believe the government won’t let them go under.** The perceived safety net creates what economists call moral hazard -- the belief that **bankers will take greater risks because they’ll enjoy any profits while shifting losses to taxpayers.**
If Congress had been aware of the extent of the Fed rescue, Kaufman says, he would have been able to line up more support for breaking up the biggest banks.

 It doesn't even have NEON SIMD's or OMAP4's (Galaxy Nexus) [IVA 3](http://www.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&amp;navigationId=12843&amp;contentId=53243) which would further improve performance and offset HD tasks from the CPU. The display might be good but it's only SLCD which means a hit of 30% more battery drain compared to SAMOLED. 

Lets not forget the [audio problems](http://phandroid.com/2011/11/30/some-htc-rezound-owners-experiencing-audio-interference-when-using-headphones/) from a device that boasts about having good audio. Overall the Rezound sounds pretty lame compared to a Galaxy Nexus and the Exynos SGSII too (The only good point is the Rezounds 720p resolution).

 HTC had its day with the Windows Mobile devices and early Android phones, It's lost any lead a while ago thanks to sticking with Qualcomm for its SoC's and refusing to have internal sd in it's devices so now it relies on gimmicks like Beats (same guys that brought you gimmicks like [monster cables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Cable_Products#Monster_Headphones))","1322698696"

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","I recently got a Makita 2012NB, and I chose it over the DeWalt for two reasons that are important to me:

It's smaller and lighter than the DW735. I don't have a garage so I have to carry all my tools outside when I use them, then back inside the house for storage. The Makita is about twenty pounds lighter. The second reason is noise. No planer is quiet, but the Makita is noticeably quieter than others. Again, because I work outside, I want to subject my neighbors to less noise when possible. I own several other Makita tools (as well as DeWalt, Porter Cable, etc.) and have had great service from all of them, so I had no hesitation about buying their planer from Amazon versus going to the local BORG to get the DeWalt. 

I researched this a lot before buying, and if I didn't have the issues conceerning weight and noise, I would probably have gone with the DeWalt because replacement blades are everywhere for this guy. I'll need to order replacement Makita blades online (but that isn't a problem with a big brand like Makita--just a minor annoyance.)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's not a generalization, but a definition of what constitutes a ""nice guy"".

A nice guy is almost entirely selfish and inherently dishonest, even if the things they do or say appear not to be. Mostly, they seek the approval of others (especially women), and have some how come to the conclusion that giving to get will reward them or get them what they need. However, they find this seldom works in their favor, leaving them wondering why they always seem to give more than they get. But, instead of realizing the flaws in their thinking and working to correct them, they just do more of the same, thinking they didn't try hard enough or didn't do something ""right"".

They try to never make mistakes, be agreeable even if they actually disagree with the person/people to avoid strife, and let people walk all over them as they are unassertive. Essentially, anything that is seen as a negative or confrontational ""jerk-like"" action or attitude is taken as something to be avoided for fear they will be disliked and shamed or abandoned. So, the driving force behind the ""nice guy"" behaving the way they do, is fear, and learning to overcome (not eliminate) the fear of shame, embarrassment, anger, etc. is probably the biggest hurdle in casting off the ""nice guy"" complex.

Nice guys are also usually self-defeating when it comes to tasks or obligations. They feel as if they can't do it ""right"", or perfectly in other people's eyes, they will be rejected and tend to give up on projects in progress or procrastinate a lot. This mentality can come about for a few reasons, a couple of which are overly critical parents or ones that do not meet the needs of the child emotionally. So, learning to discard the coping mechanisms they formed from when they were young is another way for the nice guy to move past his problems.","1322698703"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","These comments explaining why mikekozar's analogy is bad are too complicated. You can explain it much more simply.

What about all those poor people who had overgrown lawns, destroying the value of their neighborhoods and attracting crack addicts to peddle their drugs on their corners, who could finally afford to have their lawns mowed once the price dropped from $10 to $3, thereby joining the ranks of the middle class and eradicating the scourge of crack upon our troubled peoples?

What about all those other businesses suddenly flush with cash, now that the $7 otherwise captured by greedy local kids could be spent on other important staples like food and medicine?

You can have a discussion about the morality of Walmart's practices, you can have a discussion about their effect on the character of our nation, and you can have a discussion about whether or not they engage in monopolistic market manipulation. 

But you can't just pretend that they don't provide incredible value to consumers.

When you engage in protectionism, you divert resources to a protected class (local lawn mowing kids) and away from everyone else, as well as create dead weight economic loss (people who value lawn mowing at $7 who would pay someone who only valued it at $3 to do the work, thereby creating $4 of value in the world... who no longer make that transaction).","1322698709"

Most stores still make people aware either on the pricing or receipt that the price includes VAT. Businesses need to know that so they can claim it back and because you do get some places (mainly B2B) no charging VAT or showing VAT on the prices it works out that everyone tells you when the price includes VAT.

Consider it like this, now that you're not dating you can devote all your energy to yourself. It's not you and your boyfriend, but just you now. Find a hobby, or try something you've done before. Learn how to knit, start a DIY project, or even grab a few girls and hang out.

The best way to take care of it is taking your mind off of it. It may seem difficult, but the more you do it, the easier it gets.

You can do it. &lt;3

When Dagon drops down, I immediately swap to him and start spamming fire-lightning at him. It seems to stack the fire damage extremely fast, and keeps it ticking at 1400 for quite a while.

It was to the apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the head, that we believe that our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant, in order to establish on earth the one Body of Christ into which all those should be fully incorporated who belong in any way to the People of God.""

**Papal Bull Cantate Domino:**

&gt; ""It [the Church] firmly believes, professes, and proclaims that those not living within the Catholic Church, not only pagans, but also Jews and heretics and schismatics cannot become participants in eternal life, but will depart 'into everlasting fire which was prepared for the devil and his angels' [Matt. 25:41], unless before the end of life the same have been added to the flock; and that the unity of the ecclesiastical body is so strong that only to those remaining in it are the sacraments of the Church of benefit for salvation, and do fastings, almsgiving, and other functions of piety and exercises of Christian service produce eternal reward, and that no one, whatever almsgiving he has practiced, even if he has shed blood for the name of Christ, can be saved, unless he has remained in the bosom and unity of the Catholic Church."" 4

I wouldn't shy away from them if I were you, it's better to start dabbling in them so you can shed your fear a little at a time. 

That said, Python is great! I absolutely love working in it. If you're not going to get into anything serious as a programmer, you can comfortably live in Python and only rarely run into problems you can't solve with it.

As someone who is able to keep an open mind about things, I've had my perspective of many things changed and begun to realize that, while I am still spiritual/religious, I more and more want to simply be so alone. That portion about the selective reasoning and such, the reception you got after the announcement in comparison to her brother's...

It just seems like, increasingly, 'good' religious individuals are harder to come by. I don't know if it's a matter of education, the willingness to ask questions and not simply blindly follow, if it's upbringing or a combination of these things (most likely), but I have yet, outside of a small circle of like-minded and open people, to find religious (abrahamic) individuals I can hold a conversation with that doesn't lead to some walls that becomes a loop of repetitious ignorance.

I'm quite content to discuss things with those who are interested and practicing my beliefs quietly in my own personal space. I would be appalled if my family ever treated anyone like that. Outside of my immediate family, there is a high value on religion, but I could come home with the announcement that I am marrying the combination of all things they dislike (whatever they might be, just an example) and there would be nothing but smiles. So I am sorry that you had to experience that, but I am also damn proud of you for the way you are handling every aspect of your fiance's family and your relationship.

You are an epitome, Sir.

The universe, and therefore both matter and us, doesn't objectively exist, which makes everything the result of a logical implication.

Because marriage is (unfortunately) defined in our federal legislation, changing the definition is out of the question in a state parliament. This bill is about as good as it gets, for now.

Most people see this as a stepping stone. If similar bills can be passed in one or two other large Australian states, it seems likely that the federal government will finally open up the definition of marriage for debate in federal parliament.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I'm Venezuelan and I have a gripe with both Chavez and the Venezuelan people. I recently co-wrote a paper with a classmate on Venezuela, its economic situation, brief history, and political situation. Here it is in case you would be interested in reading it:

[Venezuela's Economic and Political Situation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wrbak6_ATBasZ5LfCxxkVFWkPibD1pT1zz6DgamW4vY/edit)

Hugo Chavez took advantage of the worsening economic situation to get the poorest and the neediest people to elect him. If you listen to his interviews before he got elected, he was not as belligerent and hateful as he is now.

He has increased the amount of violence suffered at the hand of the Venezuelan Government. He has continued the corrupt policies of the previous administrations. And he has turned a civilized society into a very divided nation full of scorn for each other. 

The last reason I hate him, it's because I lost the country of birth and of my youth. I'm in the U.S, the land of ""freedom and opportunity"", but ever since 9/11, this country took a wrong turn and it's been going downhill for 10 years. ","1322698759"

He made the choice as he went to college too, and although it wasn't a total shock to any of our pretty tight knit circle of friends, and we love the shit out of him so we took it in stride. Though it wasn't all a smooth transfer, it was kinda hard getting the pronouns right at first. Do you still deal with pronoun issues? Like does it offend you when someone who knows you are a man uses a feminine pronoun? Do you correct people? How do you feel about people using old nicknames for you (His name was Kelsey, but now he goes by Shawn, and so our silly bastardizations of Kelsey don't fit the name but we still use them from time)? I am asking you these things to get your opinion on this subject as I both want your input and really don't want to offend my friend at a rather tender moment in his life.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","It's not a question of deserving what happened to you, OR being blameworthy. But there are certain precautions that you should take to protect yourself in any situation. Try not to dress in ways that might attract crime. If there's a high crime rate where you live, don't wear expensive clothes/watches when you have to walk a long way by yourself. And don't park cars in places where they're easily accessible to other people if you can avoid it.

The same logic, that you can protect yourself, is applied to rape pretty often. It's not her fault. But she can protect herself, and it's unfortunate that she didn't. 

Once again, the fact remains that the way you dress, while it does not always and does not even often cause the rape, does affect how other people see you. Jeans and a sweatshirt are a smarter decision than pumps and a dress, for reasons even beyond just the ""try not to draw attention to yourself as a sexually desirable person when you're walking by yourself at night"" aspect. Running/walking in sensible clothes is much better and offers more protection than less protective outfits.

In any situation, try not to walk too far in dangerous places at night is the biggest rule to follow. Hail a cab, ask a friend, maybe even call your local police. ","1322698759"

I had to deny even people that were just over the border (river).  It almost sounds like this is what happened with you, MAYBE.  That's just what comes to mind for me when I read your story.

Really sorry that you went through all that for nothing, bud.  Don't stop searching though.  You can tell someone cares and wishes to help just by getting replies, so don't stop searching for someone who is able to.

Also, did you try contacting them before driving the three hours to see if you were eligible?

Mr. House might've had the best ideas for the future, but there's no way to guarantee he'd stick to it and abuse his robot army.

Specifics? Well, there are a lot. He kept the Leninist supremacy of the Party over the workers in place, he oversaw the bureaucratization of the Party, his agricultural policies led to the deaths of millions, he sent political dissidents to labour camps, he promoted Russian nationalism against Internationalism, he recriminalised homosexuality and made divorces much harder to get and he established a Cult of the Personality.

"photography","t5_2qh2a","First, I hope you are learning by using Aperture priority mode, and shutterspeed priority mode. (Manual mode is for when you've already gathered all those through the other.) This is where you choose one setting and the camera chooses the other two based on how much light it detects. It's not perfect but it's pretty good.  The lowest speed you can safely (everybody is different, and lenses) could be around 1/15th- 1/30th of a second hand held. Anything lower and you risk camera shake. But you can go ahead and try different shutter speeds and the camera can pick appropriate ISO and aperture. 
The higher the ISO, the more sensitive to light but more grainy.
The more open the aperture the more light gets in, and the shallower depth of field. Responsible for blurry background effects. 
The slower the shutterspeed the more light gets in. 
If your photo is too dark, adjust to let in more light.
If your photo is too light, adjust to that stuff. 
Often when taking a photo, I usually always have it set in aperture mode. Take a shot. See how I like it, see what the settings the camera chose - like I chose f/4, and the camera chose 1/60th sec and I chose ISO 400. Well, the photo was too dark, so I turn it manual mode, armed with that baseline info and I change the 1/60th slower to 1/30th. Take a photo, see how I like it. Repeat!

* A **Perfect** farm (which is every single cs) at 10 minutes is 82 cs if I'm not mistaken (4 creeps every 30 seconds, plus the 2 tanks which come twice in total in 10 minutes). This is almost impossible in a real game, except in single player, with a very good base damage start.

* A **Very good** farm in 10 minutes is around 60 cs. This usually happens only when you're dominating your lane, or have a freefarming lane.

* An **Average** farm at 10 minutes is around 30-45 cs.


**Now for Tiny, he's not expected to stay in mid lane for 10 minutes without ganking even once, not to forget managing to survive against another solo hero, so 30-50 cs is more than amazing in 10 minutes, for Tiny**.

Boots + dagger + mana support (bottle/urn/arcane/etc.) at 10-15 minutes is great if you can do it! If you don't get them at maximum 25 minutes, you're doing pretty bad... After you get them, gank non stop!

For carries who stay in lane however, if you have under 40 cs in 10 minutes, you're doing pretty bad.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","This is a sucky situation. I feel for all those involved - by the support he has received, it seems he is actually a good teacher. What if a sex tape surfaced of a local teacher? Home-made, nobody was paid for anything. Male, female, gay, straight - what happens then? Students will have it readily available, parents will need to have conversations with their children, the teacher's career may never be the same. I think this should be treated the same way because, from the student/parent perspective, I'm not sure it matters that he was paid for it, except that now the parents may have to have an additional conversation about porn. 

(I'm on a public computer, so won't Google ""local teacher"", ""sex tape"", but I wonder how that's been handled in other districts.)

Also, I don't think it should have anything to do with LGBT. Unfortunately, homophobes will make it about that - and unfortunately, the equal and opposite reaction will happen too: people will be over-sensitive/over-protective of someone being victimized because of their sexuality. ","1322698783"

I'm becoming disgusting with my desperation and driving her away.  I wish I could block her phone number from my memory b/c it's so easy to be overcome with emotion and shoot her a text....

FUCK. 

Anyways, I'm heading to the gym and then hang with a buddy of mine at the bar.  I can't fathom another woman in my life, i'm still way too in love with my wife, but our divorce will be coming as soon as she files....i just hope that by that time I'll have found some equilibrium in my heart and soul to process these emotions and not be so caught up in the SUCK of pain I'm feeling now.

So it's gym for endorphins and a bar for a buzz.

"ems","t5_2rmg0","&gt;Realistically, no one is going to put a noob paramedic in charge of anything.  If you're in a system that works paramedics, they're going to have a lot of paramedics who are more experienced around to supervise the newer ones and keep them in line.


Maybe you work in a system where multiple paramedics go to every call, but that definitely isn't the case everywhere.   I used to work in a pretty busy system, and we would try to help out new paramedics on tough calls but if there was no help there was no help.  You wear the rocker and are willing to take calls, you'd better be able to perform up to that standard.

Either way, I think it is a pretty poor argument that it is okay to be incompetent because there will be other people around to pick up the slack.  Once you start working you will find that being a paramedic is very much like being an EMT, except people actually expect you to be competent at what you do.  The IVs, EKGs, meds, all that crap is secondary to good BLS and good scene management-- that stuff comes with experience.

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","First off, you need to let them know that it's not a partisan issue. There are no democrats or republicans at OWS, only people. 

As for the goal of the movement: I would say the goal of the movement right now is to raise awareness of the problems in this country. Our Government is suppose to be for the people by the people, but has been hijacked by Wall Street and Corporate Greed. We are a country of many (99%), ruled by the few (1%).   

A great point to bring up would be to look at the members of the Presidential Cabinet, in regards to economic departments. Again this is not a partisan issue. The same people that caused the economic collapse in this country were members of the Bush Cabinet (Republican) and were reintroduced to the system under Obama (Democrat). Watch the documentary ""Inside Job"" it has great information. (The economic jargin is a bit much to understand). 

As for the movement fizzling out soon. There's no way in hell that will happen. There is a quote I keep seeing about the movement all over the place that goes, ""First they ignore you, then they criticize you, then they fight you, then you win.""

If I were in your classroom I would simply use the phrase history repeats itself. Our country has seen numerous economic collapse over the years (The Depression). The American Revolution was started because the Central Bank of England would not allow the currency the colonies were using to be used to pay taxes. This Central Banking idea is what caused the revolution in 1776. It is that very same institution that is causing the revolution we are seeing today. Do you research on the formation of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Board and you will find all your answers. I hope this is beneficial not only to your classroom discussion, but also to you as an individual and learner. Don't allow yourself to live your life afraid to question others. 

One more little hint of advice I would like to give you. Find joy in reading and do your research. The best weapon to have in this life is knowledge. ","1322698798"

If the Empire splits, then the Thalmor can pick off their targets 1 by 1 at their convenience.  The remaining empire gets attacked first and Skyrim goes ""oh, not my problem.""

Considering that synapses are much slower than transistors and logic gates, were we able to completely understand the language organ, we could implement it much more efficiently in silicon than the human brain does.

The issue has to do with complexity really. Humans need a hierarchical model to understand very complex systems (think CFGs). We need to break it down into multiple levels. Any human brain function (including language) requires a lot of flat complexity. This is the stuff we're not good at comprehending (think of holding 7000 digits of pi in memory at once and looking for a pattern and ""understanding"" it as one thing, the way you might a phone number). Computers can help us to get past this human limitation, but it's an iterative process as we build programs that help us figure out what the next problem is etc. Eventually, we will get there, but there is no magic ""understand all of language"" button.","1322698802"

Usually those are joined into a single ceremony, but they're still separate things, and you can get married in a religious ceremony that has no legal weight, as well as getting married legally in a union that some churches/religions won't accept as valid.

The latter situation is the problem, because some people are unable to separate religious and legal marriage in their mind, and so any change to the legal contract becomes a perceived violation of their religious freedom.  They don't want the law or society to apply a label that they think is the sole property of their own brand of religion.  And thus begins the debate over ""redefining marriage"".","1322698804"

Asda, for example, does not have any prices set by the US. 

The sizes aren't as incomparable as you make out, either. TESCO has ~5300 stores across 14 countries, of which ~2700 are in the UK. This compares pretty favourably with ~3800 US Walmart stores (there are also 600 Sam's Club stores, but I'm not sure how logistically independent they are). 

Of course, yes, it's a huge logistical issue to change the way these stores operate and devolve some of the label printing duties to the actual shops. 

But I don't understand your point about the cost for individualising? 

Here, all labels are calculated and printed with barcodes on the shop floor from a handheld printer; determined on a per-store level from regionally set pricing data. Almost every label in the store will be replaced within no more than a month, usually a matter of days for products with a greater price variability. If every city in the country were to apply its own sales tax, the software would already allow for the tax to be varied on a per-store level, and these would be immediately printed in exactly the same way.","1322698809"

You are saying that the two ideas are completely disconnected from each other? Here are the options that I look at that both have plausibility.

This is a given: The universe exists

This is the question: How does the universe exist in the first place?

1. something created the universe &lt;-- by definition this is what god is, that something. If the universe itself created itself, this is called pantheism, where everything is god. god just means whatever created everything. most people don't really realize that. they instantly think of a christian god, which is so close minded.
2. nothing created the universe, it has just always been there.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;A person who strives to live a moral life and to act with compassion and love towards others is carried towards salvation, despite his shortcomings. That is the essence of Lord Krishna's message in the Bhagavad Gita. We are called to unite ourselves to him through our love and devotion, and his grace will raise us to him despite our errors or shortcomings in life.

Please reread what I wrote in this paragraph. Despite our 'sins' or errors, we will achieve divine union with Lord Krishna due to his grace and his superlative love for us and not solely of our own actions. 

The idea of hell in Hinduism is not a literal one. It is the temporary manifestation or consequence of the negative karmas that one accumulates in life through ill actions. It can be mitigated through good deeds as well as through the saving grace of Lord Krishna. He will love you even if you do not recognize his presence - he will reach to save you even if you turn away from him, rather than abandon you to an eternity of suffering or allow for the destruction of your soul. 

Please don't quote Wikipedia as if it is the ultimate arbiter of Hinduism. How would you respond if a non-Christian posted distorted Wikipedia articles about Christian theology without having significant knowledge of the Christian religion? The passage you've quoted posits one potential interpretation of hell in Hinduism. Think of it as a Westboro Baptist type fundamentalist interpretation. I wouldn't dare post such an interpretation about some aspect of Christian theology and act as if that was a credible Christian position.

Hinduism is far more diverse and varied than most religions. It contains various schools of thought ranging from pantheism to monotheism to agnosticism and even atheism. The Puranas are part of a particular genre of Hindu literature that is quite explicitly mythological and symbolical. They contain narratives and histories rich with allegory and symbolism. They were created expressly so that significant philosophical concepts could be conveyed in a malleable and easily comprehensible form to large, mostly illiterate audiences. They are not meant to be interpreted literally. 

The Vedas, which are the foundational scriptural texts of Hinduism, contain not one single mention of the concept of hell in any form.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","In some societies (in only a few though) power between women and men will be similar if not equal. For example, in Norway while there is still a higher degree of men employed in top earning positions, this doesn't say much regarding the much higher numbers of women who receive relatively low wages but have extremely high standards of living due to 'social capital'. Given that male privilege is non-existent in f.ex. Norway, and we follow the definition of sexism that it is prejudice combined with power, sexism can go either way in these societies.

All this is not to say that discrimination and 'privilege' does not exist in these societies (I am talking mostly about Scandinavia here), simply that the picture is becoming less clearly divided between male and female. Class division is still very much an issue, for example.","1322698816"

There are several reasons for getting rid of nuclear: it is unsafe in a way that Germany does not want to use it (see Fukushima), storage is unsolved, it is expensive, it promotes large corporations and government structures (best for centralized, corrupt and authoritarian systems), it hinders investments into renewables, it has its own set of environmental problems, its acceptance in Germany is so low that it creates widespread civil unrest, the materials produced and the technology can be used in weapons production for nuclear weapons, reprocessing is especially ugly, Germany had a bunch of old reactors which were not very safe against certain types of errors, the power plants are too large (most of their heat is used to warm up rivers), ...

"politics","t5_2cneq","I read what you wrote, you got some good stuff there. But you also wrote that the document clearly and expressly forbids slavery. Clearly that is not the case. The document originally as written I ambivalent, which is why it gave the country so many problems until the passing of the 13-15th Ammendments. The Dred Scott decision was possible not just because Taney was a slaveholder, but because this clause supports the Fugitive Slave laws as constitutional. Clearly there are some high words about the rights of citizens, but to ignore the fact that the Framers were divided about the document is historical dishonest. They might have been Enlightened, but many were slaveholders. It took until Lincoln's time before people began to accept that even the Declaration's ""all men created equal"" didn't only apply to Anglo-Saxons (see again Dred Scott).

Saying North American slavery is from the Portugese is like saying it is from the Romans. Slavery was a deeply American institution. It was not just an economic factor, but deeply embedded in the culture of the South, arguably to this day. Slavery defined everyone's position in society, from he plantation owner to the yeoman farmer to white trash. The arguments for slavery rested on the same constitutional arguments against it: individual and state freedom. It was Lincoln in his debates with Douglas who pointed out how absurd it was to say how freedom to choose entailed the freedom to enslave anyone at any time. But even he argued from the Declaration. He was willing to pass an amendment before the War protecting slavery in the South to stop them from succeeding. 

Yea, I am a budding historian. I am not a Civil War historian, but I happen to be sitting in a class on the Civil War right now. No, I am as of yet unplublished. But do you think that historians don't get it wrong? Or that there are not an equal number of eminent thinkers who say the exact opposite (thinking Zinn off the top of my head).  

Plus, I  not an American, so I don't have the bias of the Ameican civil religion to burden me. Is the Constitution a great document?  Yes. Is it perfect?  No, or they wouldn't need to keep updating it. Did it clearly and expressly forbid slavery in it's original form?  Absolutely not, the opposite in fact.

a muslim discussing religion with people of the book (jews/christians) should follow this principle:

Say: O People of the Scripture! Come to an agreement between us and you: that we shall worship none but Allah, and that we shall ascribe no partner unto Him, and that none of us shall take others for lords beside Allah. And if they turn away, then say: Bear witness that we are they who have surrendered (unto Him). [3:64]

another core prinicple of debate in islam to find the best way to convey the message: 

And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in that which hath been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God and your God is One, and unto Him we surrender. [29:46]

the mindset of the atheist is not guided by the divine principles, logic and understanding of islam, 
but rather from his/her own ego (nafs) and what they like to belief, think is ultimate scientific truth (which often changes over time) and by what they believe is true by listening to contemporary sources.

Your situation is complex; there's a lot of different issues hiding in your post. Here's some more general advice, take it or leave it...

That job sounds like it blows; I'd start searching for a new one. But at least stick with this one for as long as you can bear it; money is money. It'll keep you up an active and might even keep your mind off more destructive things.

Also sounds like your girlfriend has given up/gotten too frustrated, so she is taking the hard-line, no-bullshit stance with you. This works with some people, but it doesn't seem like it's done you any good. Maybe sit down and discuss her method of support (or lack of). If she refuses to stop harming you, then perhaps you should separate yourself from her.

I just replaced mine.  It is really simple and the parts are readily available if you can do some very simple soldering.

The clicker inside the mouse is a D2FC-F-7N (If you want a stiffer click get one with (10M) at the end).

You can order it off Ebay and other places for a few dollars.  You just pull the pad ring from the bottom of the mouse, take out the 4 screws, carefully snap off the top and both sides.  Then take out the few screws holding the circuit board, just be careful to remove the tiny screw going to the mouse wheel and pull the wheel completely off.  

The clicker is held down by 3 metal pins that go through the board and are soldered.  Snip off the extra length on the underside and hold the solder gun against the pins and pull out the clicker.  Then just stick in the new clicker and solder it back on.

It sounds tricky but I could have it done in 10 minutes now that I know how it works.  You can even adjust how stiff the click is on the new clicker by popping the top off bending a little copper bar the adjusts how far the clicker moves when you click (I adjusted mine so it is almost silent now).","1322698835"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","As as student I was in situation like it, or rather I made good money working during summers but the last year in school we did a project instead and we spent all our money on said project. During which I lived way below the poverty line. 

I more or less spent 50€ on food per month and had nothing else - sure I could have sold of things I had, but why when I can download them for free and if I like the games pay for them later? 

No there are many situations even in rather rich countries where you can get into a position that allows you to buy or be given a decent computer - but you can't afford games to it. 

Before I was 15 I got perhaps 30€ per month from my parents, and with the normal expenses I had half was for luxury items - I still bought games like Fallout 1 or Baldur's gate ~ but I had to save for three or four months. Even so the computer we had at home was good for its time. 

Money as a student or as a child isn't easily controlled, I know many students that have to live well beyond the poverty line as the money they get per month mostly covers books, rent and food - but they still need a decent computer (same as I did at the time) to do their studies. 

Will you starve so you can buy that game? 

No, do I have a problem with people that do pirate when they are students or the like? no. I don't even have a problem with people that are unemployed or similar that pirate because at present they can't afford luxury items ~ even more so when it comes to the children of parents like it. 

&amp; Again a decent computer isn't terribly expensive and isn't a luxury item for many - I use mine every day for work and every computer I've had since I was 22 I've needed to get work or work through. 

The same goes for many others, and for friends and family around me many actually get computers for free (I give my rig away for free every 2-3 years when I upgrade). 

Now I'm set, not everyone else is - even if they have a decent computer. 

&amp; the idea that a decent 300€ computer is a luxury item only is retarded.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","Centralization was necessary for wartime socialism. Let me give you a counterexample - Catalonia under the Anarchists. They lost because they cherished their ideology about how society *should* be organized over the reality of how society *needed* to be organized in that particular moment. They could have seized power, cut a deal with the French, formed a government, and possibly beaten Franco. They didn't, and they lost to fascists which was to my mind a much larger betrayal of the people than forming a government and a real army would have been.

It's wrong to say that the USSR under Lenin was ruled with an iron fist. That's just not how it operated. That whole period was basically wartime, and it needs to be viewed in that context.

""Going against the will of the people"" is a bit vague. Can you list some concrete examples of what you mean? I have no tears to shed for bourgeois political parties. They should be banned. A revolution is the destruction of the bourgeois class, and that includes their political forms and their ideas about what a democracy should be. I don't agree about Kronstadt.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","You guys are thinking about this the wrong way. The argument isn't that rape jokes ""cause"" rape. Rape jokes (""no means yes"" or ""she's asking for it, just look at her"") don't directly cause rape like the polio virus causes polio, in the sense that if you get rid of rape jokes, you get rid of rape. People don't hear a rape joke and think oh, wow, that's a great idea.

The problem here is that 8% of men (and god knows what % of women) have raped a ~~woman~~ person but don't think they did anything wrong. The force-sex-on-someone ""meme,"" if you don't mind me using the Dawkins sense of the word, is already infecting those people. The rape jokes didn't put it there, but they're not eliminating it either.

All of us know how confirmation bias works. People infected with the forced-sex-is-fine meme hear a rape joke and their bias is confirmed - what I did was fine, didn't you hear everyone laugh at that joke? You and I hear a rape joke and of course we aren't going to change our minds on rape.

However, if you just happen to be in a group of people, you may have one of the 8% there. And if a rape joke is told, and you stand up to it, you are actually piercing through the confirmation bias and chipping away at the person's forced-sex-is-fine meme.

The argument isn't that rape jokes cause rape, it's that rape jokes are ambiguous about whether the joke-teller or the laugher(s) approve of rape or not. The bet is: in that situation, if people are more explicit about where they stand on rape, maybe fewer people will think it's fine.

Use the ones that look like you're hugging a tree--with the hands either at chest level or eye level.  It's the most brutal exercise you can imagine and at first 5 or 10 mins. will seem like a lifetime.  The goal is to reprogram your habitual breathing pattern into the most efficient pattern possible; putting awareness on your breathing will lead to that despite the varied techniques--I've achieved success with the above techniques so I can provide guidance for those if they are successful for you.  This is the foundational process for all the internal martial arts.  Just stand there hugging an invisible tree.  Then, after a few minutes, it will start to get painful and you will have to use the condensing breathing technique to relieve the pain.  When you cannot continue anymore sit down while still using the condensing breathing to manage the arm anxiety.  

In terms of slowing the breathing this will happen naturally (which you can observe as you go to sleep if you would like) as you said or you can help it along by helping it to get more efficient.  There are many techniques but they all lead to the same state.","1322698846"

I think the REAL problem is that people try to fix a failing relationship by getting married. (And this is way more likely in  a cohab situation.) I think the statistic needs to be interpreted as such. There's much more of a chance of a bandaid marriage in a cohab relationship than a non-cohab. 

Which is sad, because a lot of those relationships could get fixed through counselling/communication, and THEN get happily married. That's my opinion, anyway. But if a relationship is strong and both parties are good at dealing with issues, I think a cohab is a great way to go. ","1322698846"

Most of the farmers out their are passionate about what they do and spend countless hours caring for their livestock. People usually do not realize that farmers are concerned about the welfare of their livestock, and utilize a lot of their profits to making their livestock happy and healthy. With that said, the poultry industry tends to be at the bottom in terms of animal welfare, however this is usually for chickens in cages. In terms of free range, chickens have everything that they need. When housed in barns, chickens can roam freely in somewhat crowed areas but they have adequate room to move and get water and feed. Some chickens have outdoor areas as well. It is like saying that the middle class of society suffers just because the upper classes have it better. In sum, chickens are given enough to live a modest life and the majority of farmers make that happen.

"linguistics","t5_2qhos","&gt;There's also a tendancy for the feminine form words to be lenited compared to the masculine.

Well in Irish, feminine nouns are lenited (where possible) after the article in the nominative case. I believe Gàidhlig is similar (if memory serves me). In the genitive case, the opposite is true - masculine nouns are lenited, whereas feminine ones aren't (I'm not sure about Gàidhligh). 

For prepositions, I imagine the masculine/feminine forms derive from 'sé' and 'sí' (he and she), so for example 'ag + sí' = 'aici' where the vowel isn't too far off the one in 'sí'. Someone with a knowledge of Old Irish might tell you how the current prepositions came about. I believe they changed around a bit relatively recently in the history of Irish.

In general, though, I don't think there's much of a pattern of vowels marking gender. ","1322698849"

Make up your mind. Israel would be completely justified to deny the vote to muslims, but it doesn't. It gives them full rights as far as I can tell.

If you were one of 15 million muslims in a world with 1.5 billion Jews, and the Jews had 50+ countries and you had but 1, you would absolutely not want your country to be taken over by Jews. I fail to see why a religious divide is unfair. It's best for both peoples. Why would you want to live in a country with a people you cannot ever stop hating?

You also need an island in play in order to cast Daze. This makes it useless before your first turn. You're also not the best example to take advantage of being able to cast daze after using your initial mana for improving your board position, since your deck is freaking mono-blue control, aka ""island-go"".

Look, I play legacy mono-blue control. I'd put Force Spike in my deck before Daze. Which is a moot point, since I'd put spell pierce and spell snare in before those, but still. Daze's alternate casting cost hurts mono-blue control more than it hurts your opponent.","1322698856"

My only point is about this part:

&gt; others, like those in the OWS, may criticize the government for its actions

Most of what I've heard from OWS has not been criticism of the government, but of the banks.  What baffles me is that OWS is rallying around the evils of corporate greed, and how the banks are the manifestation of all that is evil in the world - when, in fact, the government bailed them out.  Shouldn't they be mad at the government?

I guess there's not much point in debating the rest of your comment, but thanks again for clarifying.  I know it's easy to say ""liberals are morons"" or ""conservatives are idiots"", but I think most folks hold their political beliefs because they genuinely think they're what's best for everyone.","1322698864"

"politics","t5_2cneq","@Shamblingman - You are correct the bill hasn't passed, but you clearly haven't read the [Obama Administrations reasoning behind not supporting Section 1031 &amp; 1032](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/legislative/sap/112/saps1867s_20111117.pdf)

I'll quote part of it here:

&gt;**Section 1031** attempts to expressly codify the detention authority that exists under the Authorization for Use of Military Force (Public Law 107-40) (the “AUMF”).  The authorities granted by the AUMF, including the detention authority, are essential to our ability to protect the American people from the threat posed by al-Qa'ida and its associated forces, and have enabled us to confront the full range of threats this country faces from those organizations and individuals.  **Because the authorities codified in this section already exist, the Administration does not believe codification is necessary** and poses some risk.  After a decade of settled jurisprudence on detention authority, Congress must be careful not to open a whole new series of 2 legal questions that will distract from our efforts to protect the country.  While the current language minimizes many of those risks, future legislative action must ensure that the codification in statute of express military detention authority does not carry unintended consequences that could compromise our ability to protect the American people.


&gt;The Administration strongly objects to the military custody provision of **section 1032**, which would appear to mandate military custody for a certain class of terrorism suspects.  **This unnecessary, untested, and legally controversial restriction of the President's authority to defend the Nation from terrorist threats would tie the hands of our intelligence and law enforcement professionals.** Moreover, applying this military custody requirement to individuals inside the United States, as some Members of Congress have suggested is their intention, would raise serious and unsettled legal questions and would be inconsistent with the fundamental American principle that our military does not patrol our streets. **We have spent ten years since September 11, 2001, breaking down the walls between intelligence, military, and law enforcement professionals; Congress should not now rebuild those walls and unnecessarily make the job of preventing terrorist attacks more difficult.**  Specifically, the provision would limit the flexibility of our national security professionals to choose, based on the evidence and the facts and circumstances of each case, which tool for incapacitating dangerous terrorists best serves our national security interests.  The waiver provision fails to address these concerns, particularly in time-sensitive operations in which law enforcement personnel have traditionally played the leading role.  These problems are all the more acute because the section defines the category of individuals who would be subject to mandatory military custody by substituting new and untested legislative criteria for the criteria the Executive and Judicial branches are currently using for detention under the AUMF in both habeas litigation and military operations.  Such confusion threatens our ability to act swiftly and decisively to capture, detain, and interrogate terrorism suspects, and could disrupt the collection of vital intelligence about threats to the 
American people.  

Which I read as: ""we don't like this language because it actually puts some definition around this nice hazy grey area the President can currently operate under""...","1322698874"

Additionally, most firms can pay the fines that are assessed against them.

That might be the *thinking*, but it isn't the reality.  The guy is a D1 college football official.  Fist pumps aren't automatic.    

**&gt;Mind telling when you wouldn't ref a game?**

I have teams that I follow. One is the college that I attended. I won't work any of their games however because I went to school there. Could I work their games without bias? Yes. But I won't bc I want there to be no thought or insinuation of impropriety on my part.


I follow another school simply because I like how they play. I'm not in any way connected to that school though, so I could work their games in theory. Would I feel comfortable working their games....yes.
*Why?*
Because I don't give 2 shits who wins *any* game. I even mentioned it my other thread that many times I don't even know who is winning or losing in games I work. All I care about is my calls and that our crew does a great job. That's it.
As an official, if I did feel I would be unable to work a game without bias, I would not accept the assignment or tell the assignor I don't want to work that team's games.

**&gt;What we could do to spot a ref who is too biased?**

Again, it would be so rare as to see a *clearly* biased official.  Fans want to assume bias.  They *want* someone to blame.  It's gotta be the officials!  They like the other team!  I understand fans want their team to win, but the officials are not out to get your team.  I promise.  If they are, it *will* be seen/discovered.  Personally, if I know a fellow official is acting biased, I will speak to my supervisor **because it is my ass and reputation he's putting on the line.**  I have too much pride in my profession and skills to let some good 'ol boy ruin it for everybody.  Every other official feels this way as well.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Gases do stratify due to mass differences to some extent, but the reason gases (for the sake of simplification, assume the gases are ideal) actually *mix* has a thermodynamic explanation to it.

Without delving too deep into the math behind it (trust me, I'm terrible at it too), you can predict whether or not a reaction will proceed by looking at its Gibbs Energy (or Gibbs Free Energy). A reaction will occur spontaneously if the change in Gibbs Energy is negative, and this is what chemists mean when they talk about a reaction 'going downhill' - they're just saying that the reaction will occur because it is energetically favored. Think of it as rolling down a valley: when you're climbing a mountain and you lose your footing, you fall down into a valley spontaneously. 

If the valley is surrounded by mountains high enough, you'll need a lot of energy to get out of it no matter which path you take. This is kind of like chemical inertness, since you'll most likely end up being trapped in the valley and dying with little hope of rescue. Thus, a reaction with a positive change in Gibbs Energy is unfavorable, and isn't going to occur unless you supply energy into the system. If the change in Gibbs Energy equals zero, then your reaction is at equilibrium.

Taking the idea a bit further, we can say that the 'chemical potential' of a substance is the amount of Gibbs Energy it has per mole of substance. Now, pretend you have a closed container with two species of an ideal gas. We know that the chemical potential of one of the specimen in its unmixed form is a function of temperature and pressure (from the ideal gas law, remember that volume is constant in this case). The chemical potential of the specimen in a mixture, however, is a function of temperature, pressure, **and mole fraction of that specimen in the mixture**. 

Since the mole fraction of a species in a substance, is, well, a fraction, the chemical potential of the mixture will always be lower than the chemical potential of a pure substance. Therefore, a species of gas will prefer to be in a mixture, since it will have a lower Gibbs Energy than in its initial (pure, unmixed) state.

I tried explaining this using words as best as I can, but it think it's better approached mathematically - this [website](http://www.chem.arizona.edu/~salzmanr/480a/480ants/mixpmqis/mixpmqis.html) has some mathematical justifications for why mixtures have lower Gibbs Energy than pure substances.


tl;dr (vague layman's explanation): Gibbs energy is:

G(p,T) = H - TS

A chemical process (i.e. reactions, mixing, phase changes) is favored when G is small. In a mixture with equivalent moles of different species of ideal gas, the species prefer to be mixed because it results in a higher entropy (S), which implies a lower value for G.","1322698884"

"NZmusic","t5_2svyl","Hmm, let's see. She's pretty popular - she has won multiple awards I think (proper, national industry awards). From what I remember she also got her first break after entering an amateur songwriting competition and wrote a song about her dad (I think) who died of cancer. So she's recognised, and respected by at least some of the population. I would have thought most young people would be able to point her out, her song 'under my skin' was quite popular a year or 2 ago. 

Anyway, NZ doesn't really have 'a Britney'. We don't really go crazy for single artists, generally, or I guess that's not strictly true, let me rephrase - we don't idolise our single artists. There are of course many single artists who are popular (Anika Moa, Anna Coddington, Hayley Westenra, Natasha Bedingfield, Lisa Crawley, Ladi6, umm that guy who won Australian Idol, Scribe, Bic Runga, P-Money, etc. etc...) but they don't have fans camping outside their hotels or anything. In fact that would just be downright weird, here, because you're just as likely to bump into them in the supermarket. 

Most if not all of those artists, and others, would really struggle to fill a 'big' venue (and what we call big, you probably call tiny), so it's quite common for someone to play at a bar, or small club, or vineyard, rather than any sort of arena or the like. (The upside of this is that these smaller venues are a lot more intimate!) You see, we just don't have very many people here. Big international bands can fill out one of our large venues easily enough, but many times they don't bother coming because the costs of shipping things to this remote a location is pretty high. And as a result, ticket prices are extortionate - I haven't been to any in a while but I think they tend to range from $150 - $300 a ticket quite easily. When I think back to when I lived in London and could catch many international acts any night of the week for anywhere between 15 - 30 quid, it galls me a little bit (although I do understand why it's so expensive here.)

Anyway, back to Gin. She, like a great many of our musicians, has tended to base herself in Australia. Australia has a lot more people, and therefore potential money and exposure. It's a bone of contention between Australians and New Zealanders - in the past it's been very common for our artists to head over there and then get more famous and then Australians go ""check out this cool Aussie band!"" It has irked a lot of kiwis over the years and in revenge we secretly snuck a breeding pair of drop-bears into the country and well, look how that turned out. 

Anyway, I feel like this was a bit of a ramble, I hope you got something useful out of it!

p.s. if you like New Zealand music I highly recommend The Naked and Famous. ","1322698894"

Start doing some tournaments on playhem or whatever existing tournament site you want to use and require everyone to submit their replays.  Then start a youtube channel where you cast those replays and generate money from that by getting viewers.  Once you manage to make any money on it then give your tournaments a label/site/whatever and start trying to get bigger names to play in it by saying it's for charity and say the prize pool is based on whatever amount of money you've managed to generate per tournament in the past.

a) How is that relevant at all? He was punished for heresy, not for being a dick.

b) Much of science involves information that only a handful of people can understand. So?

c) His theory fit the measurements better than anything else at the time. It was later refined with more data and calculations. Anyway, he was not wrong about heliocentrism, which was the real issue.

d) This is pretty much the same as b). If he can justify his claims with the data, why should this be a problem?

The church hired someone to do science, presumably because he was capable of more complex analysis than others. It couldn't have been unexpected for him to find something unknown, surprising, and difficult to understand at the time. He just happened to discover something that went against the church's position, and to a Catholic official, that means against God, so he was punished unduly. There is no defense against this. The church made a mistake, and the only redeeming factor is that they have officially apologized, although the fact that it took hundreds of years doesn't look good.","1322698932"

"investing","t5_2qhhq","Your dad's analysis is fine in spirit and his conclusions are right, but the analysis is flawed and wrong.

In order to do this right, you have to look at the index in (1) inflation-adjusted terms, (2) on a log scale to remove the exponential component, and (3) in terms of total return (dividends included).

Here's a graph that satisfies the first two:
http://www.multpl.com/s-p-500-price/

You'll see that the fluctuations actually haven't gotten worse compared to previous periods.

But it is true that if you're indexing, when you begin and when you end investing makes almost all the difference. (In fact, once you accumulate enough money so that your annual contributions are dwarfed by how much money you already have invested, adding new money doesn't meaningfully help to smooth returns any more, contrary to what a lot of people believe.)

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I'd say tickets to Phish (excluding the New Year's runs) are way cheaper than any music festival. You could probably see an entire Phish three night stand for the cost of one day at Coachella.

The difference is those heavily-marketed festivals feature 30+ bands that play for maybe 30-45 minutes (aside from the headliners that play maybe 2 hours max). The cost is in paying all of the bands to play at their show because they want to get as many people to the festival as possible by providing a nice palette of bands to choose from.

This opposed to a Phish concert where it's one band playing. They have a lot more control over the ticket price because they can choose how much goes into their pocket and how much goes to cover the cost of putting on the show (lighting, roadies, venue fees, etc.). I'd bet that Phish have the same take-home as one of the openers at a big music festival for playing probably 5x as long of a set. But I'm sure that Coachella requires a much larger venue than a Phish concert (unless any phans know of the average attendance at Superball).","1322698950"

I'll give you this: There are cases in which guys have been convicted by overzealous prosecutors of a number of sex crimes which they weren't guilty of, that I understand. A ""rational"" fear based upon that might be that a guy doesn't want to be left alone with the teenage girl next door, or that a teacher may not want to have ""alone time"" with a student, or that a guy might not want to work in a day care period. It's shitty that our society is like that, and I don't refute it nor do I think it's irrational to do things to protect yourself.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Addressing specifically 

&gt; no sex before marriage

I'd like to point out that, in a theoretical society were nobody is permitted to have sex with anyone besides one person, sexually-transmitted diseases would be non-existent as diseases that were transmitted sexually. Also, children would only be born into established families that were able to support them (assuming other customs regarding marriage preparations were followed). Additionally, the emotional aspects of sex would be easier to deal with, as would the dramas that occur around multiple partners. Currently, these precautionary measures are rendered 98% null because of condoms and free therapy alone, but anyone who doesn't want to risk the 2% (like myself), or is already dealing with major unrelated mental and emotional problems (also like myself) is well served by grabbing onto the religious code as an additional reason to keep it in the pants. Of course, for those who have accepted Christ, there is the whole ""Thus sayith the Lord"" thing.

About the homosexual thing, my best guess is that most feel as if it goes against what the Lord intended when ""he created them male and female"" (though, the Bible does say that nobody can know the Lord's intentions). It *does* say, however, that one cannot lie with another of their gender. A practical reason that I've heard is that, in the theoretical society as described before, lineage was a very important thing (as the savior of the world would be coming from the family line somewhere down the road), and the home served as a place to ensure that the continuation of the lineage was raised as best was possible. Even with today's technology two of the same gender can't really pass on the torch, so back then it was very much against the whole reason why the families in the theoretical society existed. Today, the rules have changed for the stricter so anyone joining the Christian order is expected to not even entertain thoughts related to such things. If one isn't able to think amorously of the opposite sex, they can choose to drive all sexual thoughts from their mind (which requires great discipline, meditation, and devotion, and is something that Christ challenges anyone to do if they are so able). 

About the story of Sodom, I think you're half-right. I don't think that God particularly cared that there were homosexuals there, but I don't suppose that he was in their favor. I think that he was more about stomping out all the other behaviors associated with the city, like the rape, violence, corruption, etc. There was homosexuality, and really all these behaviors, in other cities in the ancient world, but Sodom was *especially* bad (the crowds demanded that Lot's *guests* be sent out to be raped). As God sent a flood to wipe out the ancient humans for their *extremely bad* sin, so did he send the burning, sulfuric rain (NOT a flood, as he said he wouldn't do that again) to take care of this problem.

Also, one thing that I think that everyone forgets when they're talking about Christian moral guidelines and the like, is that the code as written in the Bible (* especially* the part about our thoughts being sacrosanct) is *only* for the Christians. We cannot judge a heathen, nor can we impose our code upon them. Paul, in one of this letters (I forget which one) very clearly states this. In my mind, because of what is said, it appears that ***Christianity is supposed to be very much more a benevolent monastic order then an authoritarian moral police force.*** If we all would follow this instruction (which is very clearly spelled out, and not subject to abstract interpretation), the majority of theistic debates wouldn't ever happen, and the remainder would be far friendlier. It's ramifications for Reddit would be that /r/atheism would either have far less material or would become far less anti-christian.

tl;dr- STDs and Kids, the lineage, Sodom was very very very *very* ***very*** bad, and (somewhat unrelated to the question) we're supposed to be monks not police.

"news","t5_2qh3l","yeah, im not sure what the legalities of a company ""labeling"" a person mentally unstable, or passing that knowledge to a future employer, are, so you bring up a good point. It sounded like the new company described him as a ""poor employee"", which doesn't necessarily mean ""mentally unstable"", and would be within the rights of the former employer to say, so long as it wasn't false, aka slander in legalese. 

from the article; 

&gt;Meyer resigned from BAE in May. He then tried obtaining a job at a &gt;former employer, San Diego-based Ausgar Technologies, but the &gt;lawsuit claims the opportunity fell through after McCreight &gt;characterized Meyer as a poor employee during a conversation with a &gt;manager who had to approve new hires.

the ""mentally unstable"" line seems to originate in the internal email here: 

&gt;""Bottom line, it was determined that ... you were not recommended to &gt;be placed back on the team due to being mentally unstable and no &gt;performing on OASYS tasks assigned,"" according to an email from an &gt;Ausgar manager included in the lawsuit.

it doesn't seem clear if this internal memo was given to the new employer. I would imagine medical info like that is legally protected, so if that was sent to the new employer, then yes, it seems like that would be some kind of violation of his right to medical privacy, and i guess sue-worthy

Also, the one thing that seems the most messed up here is the way the manager is described berating him, the ""pending star"" comments etc., are just low and unproductive, so if that's true, then yes, it would appear that manager was being a pretty huge jerk. ","1322698955"

RTD Christmas specials, let's see.  Christmas Invasion was really fun, okay, I quite liked that.  Nothing special as a story but a good fun romp and an introduction to the 10th doctor.

Donna Noble and the Spiders from Spidertown?  Well, it wasn't BAD per se.  It had Donna at her most irritating, but she was MEANT to be like that.  It was fun, but nothing special.

Kylie Minogue and the space titanic that saved christmas: eh.  fairly average, really.  Didn't do a huge amount for me.

The next doctor: in some ways, one of my favourites of the specials, what with the ""other"" doctor and all.  On the other hand, the giant victorian steampunk cyberking was decidedly off.

the end of time: had some brilliant moments and some very shoddy ones, and really isn't a christmas special at ALL except by sheer virtue of happening to fall on christmas and a cursory nod in the plot.

In comparison, we have a christmas carol last year, which was ALL about christmas, ridiculously fun, and had some absolutely brilliant acting in.

The jugolone can be broken down through composting, but it usually takes about 6 months, from what I've read, before the compost is considered to have low enough levels of juglone for the compost to be used in the garden.  It is also advised that black walnut leaves make up no more than 1/3 of the total volume of the compost pile.  As for the nuts that black walnuts produce: best to send those off to the city/county compost dump as they are especially rich in juglone and I have never heard anyone say they are good for future garden compost.","1322698958"

"Catacombs","t5_2t5r5","A word used in the *King James Version* (as well as in the Catholic Douay Version and most older translations) to translate the Hebrew sheʼohl′ and the Greek hai′des. In the King James Version the word “hell” is rendered from sheʼohl′ 31 times and from hai′des 10 times. This version is not consistent, however, since sheʼohl′ is also translated 31 times “grave” and 3 times “pit.” In the Douay Version sheʼohl′ is rendered “hell” 64 times, “pit” once, and “death” once.

In 1885, with the publication of the complete *English Revised Version*, the original word sheʼohl′ was in many places transliterated into the English text of the Hebrew Scriptures, though, in most occurrences, “grave” and “pit” were used, and “hell” is found some 14 times. This was a point on which the American committee disagreed with the British revisers, and so, when producing the *American Standard Version* (1901) they transliterated sheʼohl′ in all 65 of its appearances. Both versions transliterated hai′des in the Christian Greek Scriptures in all ten of its occurrences, though the Greek word Ge′en‧na (English, “Gehenna”) is rendered “hell” throughout, as is true of many other modern translations.

Concerning this use of “hell” to translate these original words from the Hebrew and Greek, *Vine’s Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words* (1981, Vol. 2, p. 187) says: “HADES . . . It corresponds to ‘Sheol’ in the O.T. [Old Testament]. In the A.V. of the O.T. [Old Testament] and N.T. [New Testament], it has been unhappily rendered ‘Hell.’”

*Collier’s Encyclopedia* (1986, Vol. 12, p. 28) says concerning “Hell”: “First it stands for the Hebrew Sheol of the Old Testament and the Greek Hades of the Septuagint and New Testament. Since Sheol in Old Testament times referred simply to the abode of the dead and suggested no moral distinctions, the word ‘hell,’ as understood today, is not a happy translation.”

It is, in fact, because of the way that the word “hell” is understood today that it is such an unsatisfactory translation of these original Bible words. *Webster’s Third New International Dictionary*, unabridged, under “Hell” says: “fr[om] . . . helan to conceal.” The word “hell” thus originally conveyed no thought of heat or torment but simply of a ‘covered over or concealed place.’ In the old English dialect the expression “helling potatoes” meant, not to roast them, but simply to place the potatoes in the ground or in a cellar.

The meaning given today to the word “hell” is that portrayed in *Dante’s Divine* Comedy and Milton’s *Paradise Lost*, which meaning is completely foreign to the original definition of the word. The idea of a “hell” of fiery torment, however, dates back long before Dante or Milton. The Grolier Universal Encyclopedia (1971, Vol. 9, p. 205) under “Hell” says: “Hindus and Buddhists regard hell as a place of spiritual cleansing and final restoration. Islamic tradition considers it as a place of everlasting punishment.” The idea of suffering after death is found among the pagan religious teachings of ancient peoples in Babylon and Egypt. Babylonian and Assyrian beliefs depicted the “nether world . . . as a place full of horrors, . . . presided over by gods and demons of great strength and fierceness.” Although ancient Egyptian religious texts do not teach that the burning of any individual victim would go on forever, they do portray the “Other World” as featuring “pits of fire” for “the damned.”—*The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria*, by Morris Jastrow, Jr., 1898, p. 581; *The Book of the Dead*, with introduction by E. Wallis Budge, 1960, pp. 135, 144, 149, 151, 153, 161, 200.

“Hellfire” has been a basic teaching in Christendom for many centuries. It is understandable why *The Encyclopedia Americana* (1956, Vol. XIV, p. 81) said: “Much confusion and misunderstanding has been caused through the early translators of the Bible persistently rendering the Hebrew Sheol and the Greek Hades and Gehenna by the word hell. The simple transliteration of these words by the translators of the revised editions of the Bible has not sufficed to appreciably clear up this confusion and misconception.” Nevertheless, such transliteration and consistent rendering does enable the Bible student to make an accurate comparison of the texts in which these original words appear and, with open mind, thereby to arrive at a correct understanding of their true significance.","1322698964"

I think in the latter case it's more of a wake up, don't remember much, assume you were coerced/forced into it, freak out and work yourself up, your friends agree with you, and then bam! an accusation is made.

However, obviously if a person has insurmountable issues like violence, abuse, mental illness, then maybe they are not capable of those things for their children, and adoption in that case may be an optimal solution.

When lives and futures are in the balance, the equation is always difficult to suss out.  It is surely one of the many conundrums that make up the human condition.

They say that if a person wants to eat, then they should have the money to pay for food. If a person wants health insurance, then that person should opt to pay for it themselves. The extreme right wing sees no role for any government/social safety nets at all, at least not for *individuals*. 

The same group sees charity work as a province for churches- hence, no conflict about running their own welfare system. Hey, all the better to exert control over those receiving aid. *You didn't think that can-o-beans came without any strings attached, did ya?* I wish that this simple picture were a strawman argument, but that really seems to be the stated position and ultimate goal of the right. :(

"montreal","t5_2qnmr","There are a lot of wailing about corruption in Québec.

Corruption has a long, distinguished history that predates confederation (John Molson, for example). Confederation itself is a big corrupt story. Initially, it was planned to have referendums to approve whether Québec would join confederation or not. Such referendums were held in New-Brunswick and Nova-Scotia and they failed to pass. Back then, only landowners could vote, and voting was not secret, but registered — you could know who voted for whom. As the scatholic church was to be granted a total control over education in Québec (so it could brainwash the people into being devout sheep that paid the tithe), it threatened anyone who would vote “no” with excommunication. Despite that, when it was clear that the referendum would fail, it was withdrawn and the question was submitted to the legislative assembly who voted for it at 50% plus 1. Sounds familiar? This is why the 50%+1 question raised so much anger during the 1995 sovereignty referendum.

For the record, Nova Scotia and New-Brunswick were eventually confederated, and for decades, they sent separatist members of parliament to the House of Commons. Betcha you never learned that in history class!!!

Corruption is nothing new; the Duplessis government of 60-70 years ago was notorious for that. 

Succeeding governments have always fell prey to occult control by the establishment. In the 1970’s, the federalist liberal government was mired so deep in scandals that the prime minister of the time, Robert Bourassa, was known as the most-hated prime minister of Québec ever. It paved the way to the landslide victory of the sovereignist Parti-Québécois of René-Lévesque.

This is here where the shit hit the fan big-time. For centuries, we have faced a federal government that was determined to eliminate the french from Canada, and it was well on it’s way of succeeding. Ethnic cleansing also has a long, distinguished history. From nearly 97% french people in 1760, the proportion was down to 50% at confederation (1867) to slightly more than 25% in 1975 — those figures are for the whole of Canada. This was achieved through immigration that was expected as a matter of course to become english.

So it was urgent to act, and as the previous law 22 (the very law that made french the official language of Québec, a law that was passed by the very federalist liberal government of Robert Bourassa) was not going to be sufficient to stem the tide (demographic projections would have had less than 50% french people by 2000) so the much more radical law 101 was passed, a law that has survived 30 years of constitutional challenges.

A very good side-effect of the law was the self-exodus of the more indomitable rhodesians, those people who have lived all their lives in Québec and never had stooped so low to learn that disgusting french language and who thought that the sole virtue of being english put them above everyone else. This was a good riddance as it ridded Québec of it’s most undesirable bigoted, ignorant and narrow-minded citizens.

Law 101 does not deny anyone of any human rights. Everyone has the freedom of speech in the language of his choice; everyone has the right to have good education. It’s just that companies, not being human, cannot claim to have any human rights, so they are prohibited from putting-up english signs.

Despite having been seriously gutted, it was nevertheless successful in stopping dead on it’s track the anglicization of immigrants; we are no longer threatened with extinction, but it far from means that we should relax our struggle, for french is still very much threatened in Québec, and particularly in Québec. Every single one of us has to put his hand to the struggle if we want to save our language and culture because it is on a relentless assault by a huge number of people who just do not care.

This is what I do, here and in real life. I refuse to speak english to immigrants, no matter how they squirm in unease (and it’s not I don’t like immigrants — I never, ever had a french girlfriend, ever, nor would I consider to do so; heck, I even put-up with one who would absolutely refuse to learn french even in the face of losing her job because of it; she had to move out, and she lost “the love of her life”. After 12 years apart, we have finally accepted that it’s over, and she has another boyfriend — a french guy, of course, because small-town english are simply racist. By my experience, immigrants are far less likely to be untrustworthy).

I cannot stand racism either; I half-grew up in the english ghetto of Notre-Dame-de-Grâce. 40 years ago there, it was pretty much speak white wall-to-wall there. Well, one day, I was walking with a neighbour. On the other side of the street were 3 black guys going the other way; back then, blacks in Notre-Dame-de-Grâce were a rare sight. My “friend” shouted “fuck you stupid niggers” or something polite like that. Then he started to run. I started to run, too, and when I caught-up with him, I grabbed his hood, stopping him on a dime. Just as I grabbed his arms and turned him around, the three blacks arrived, and gave him a nice manual conference (une mise au POING) on how it was not nice to do what he did.

The french here have been dubbed “[the white niggers of America](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Niggers_of_America)”. As it happens, we were treated just as bad as the blacks are in the US. In some aspects, it could even be argued we’re treated worse: the price difference between equivalent houses in Hull and Ottawa is far more than houses in white or black neighbourhood in the US. It’s not surprising that immigrants coming here wanted to become english; if one could choose his race, would any immigrant want to become a black when going to the US? This is what the english have been counting on to anglicize the immigrants, and it worked fine until we had law 101 passed.

But as you cannot change your race, you can change your language, and a lot of french people have become english, too. When you are told for 250 years that you are good for nothing, that you are shit, that you won’t ever amount to be anything because you’re french, some people are bound to believe it, and so outside of Québec, the rate of assimilation has been going up at an ever-increasing rate. For refusing to become english, we have endured a tremenduous amount of discrimination, punishment, grief and poverty. So there are a lot of french people who will blindly take the english’s side, but fortunately, there are less and less of those.

It is telling that in Ottawa, despite being a purportedly bilingual city, a lot of chain stores simply will not display bilingual signs where they have french signs a few blocks further north in Québec. Would they have french signs if they were not forced by law to have them?

I will stop here, I have been writing this for 3 hours and I surely can’t go on forever.

So, if you have non-stupid questions, just ask, it’s not that I don’t have anything to say…","1322698986"

Let's establish that being high, or being drunk impairs your ability to drive. While the majority of drunk driving fatalities might be *very* drunk [citation needed], they still happen at all levels of inebriation. You don't need to be knocked out high to be inebriated. And the majority of the people who would be smoking pot wouldn't be smoking until they're couch locked. It will certainly happen, but the 'abusers' will only be a fraction of the users. It's *possible*, but I don't know anyone who exclusively smokes like that. People *will* smoke and drive, and they will get into fatal accidents. And while it's just a guess, I'd imagine more people will smoke and drive than will drink and drive. Who do you know that downs a couple beers at two in the afternoon?","1322698986"

A refugium is a place where copepods and amphipods can live without being eaten by fishes. It often contains live rock and/or sand, and it can be a good place to grow macroalgae.

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; The only terribly-formatted brace code I've seen were Java submissions when I was a TA.

I haven't seen much either. I also don't get bitten by a lot of things people say is a problem for them:

* Gotos. I've never seen them used in such quantity in human-written code that they actually make the code unreadable. Sure, the writers of the Linux kernel use them, but their code is not unreadable.
* Expressions in bracy languages without braces. These would be something like ""if (1+1 == 2) x = 1; else x = 2;"". Never had a problem with those either.
* Assignment expressions. Legality of stuff like ""while ((x = strtok(...))) { ... }"" in C. Some people go so far as to write stuff like ""if (1 == x)"" because of it. My ""="" key is not glitchy and I look at the screen while I type. Maybe that's why I don't recall ever making this particular error.
* Plenty of other solutions looking for a problem, like Hungarian notation.

The problem with observations like these is that they're very much *n=1*. Unfortunately, I don't think there's a way around that except by gathering real data. In particular, relying on ""folk wisdom"" (read: current intellectual fashion) is quite unreliable. Plenty of programmers buy into fads and unthinkingly regurgitate stuff told to them by their CS professor (or anyone with a good rhetoric going, really). So you never know which parts of the accumulated folk wisdom are [onions](http://www.paulgraham.com/arcll1.html). For example, the very well-established [goto taboo](http://stackoverflow.com/a/2809622) seems to be one of the onions (or [bananas](http://i.snag.gy/kdu77.jpg)); the problem is long gone but the taboo remains. This does not inspire confidence in folk wisdom.","1322699003"

Game I have yet to remember the name of/find online. All I remember is that you were 2 guys, not humanoids. It was a fun animation style, similar to Humongous, but I don't think they made it because I didn't recognize it from their wiki page. In the game I remember, you were in a desert, definitely Egypt even if it was not recognized as such, solving some sort of mystery. There were blue scarabs (i THINK) pretty much the equivalent of coins) everywhere. The other big think I remember is that you had to solve a riddle given to you by the sphynx itself.

"Fantasy","t5_2qknd","Well, I'll be totally honest (and eventually everything I type here will end up in a review of MHI on my blog), MHI had a cool story, decent characters, but the writing sort of let me down a little bit. I mean, he sold the book originally to the gun-toting crowd that he'd met and embraced on some forums and his own blog, and that's pretty apparent when you see all the overly long description of the guns in the book. I've taken to calling it Gunsterbation, and there was a LOT of it in the first book, then it started to slowly decline to more managable terms, where he just looked like a writer that knew a lot about guns and wanted it to be accurate. The huge amount of lengthy gun description threw me out of the story, though, since I'm not a gun nut.

Also, I would have given a very important body part for one of his characters to use a contraction somewhere in that story. All of the dialogue had ""is not"" or ""was not"" rather than ""wasn't"" or ""isn't,"" which really threw me out of the story on a number of times. He's been getting better and better at correcting this with each novel, but MHI was riddled with 'em.

The Grimnoir Chronicles are pretty equal to Monster Hunter Alpha in terms of quality, but definitely above the first two Monster Hunter books. The second Grimnoir book is just slightly better than the first, so I'm going to say that it might be the best book he's written so far (haven't read Dead Six yet).

Judaism is a religion that I believe is very distinct from Christianity, mostly because it is ""monolatrous"".  We only have one god, but we acknowledge He might not be the only one out there, and he is just our God.

Judaism might be radical in some ways.  For example, you must kill anybody who lives in the Holy Land (i.e., Israel) and who will not convert.  However, Jews believe we can have our own interpretations of laws.  If you want to wear a kippah, that's alright.  If you believe in Heaven or Hell, that's your opinion.  Thankfully, there are many rules God goes by with Hell, and the *maximum* amount of time you can spend there is 11 months.  They also hint its not suffering, but educating you to become a more accepting person and such.
&gt;Please share specific examples of how you practice your birth religion today.
I pray daily and go to a Jewish school, and of course I observe holidays and shabbat.  So yeah, I have respect for atheists.  I know many Jewish atheists (a very interesting theology).  However I think sometimes you guys can be as radical as the crusaders.","1322699018"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Computer Gaming World attempted to turn themselves into the Sports Illustrated of gaming magazines about five years ago. They threw out review scores and wrote indepth articles on games they reviewed. Instead of previews and rumour mills, they did pieces on subjects like game development in the middle east. The rationale was that they couldn't really compete with the internet sites for reviews, previews or news so they tried to do what Sports Illustrated does with sports, write good articles on topics that the internet sites don't cover. All they got was letters of complaints about the lack of review scores. A couple years later, they changed their name to Games for Windows: The Official Magazine. Soon after, the magazine died. 

Gaming magazines are really in a catch 22. Nobody really wants boutique publications that delve beyond the 7-10 scale but the internet sites do the shallow bullshit better and faster. So what's the point of buying a gaming mag?

I felt different because I didn't want to wear dresses or play with dolls like all the other girls, and would rather wrestle with the boys in the dirt. As I grew up, I suppressed those feelings and tried to conform to my biological gender, which brought depression and disassociation from people because I was so uncomfortable.

It wasn't meant to be so much about hopelessness as it was about shifting priorities after you have a kid. I don't have any numbers on this, but I'd be willing to bet that there aren't many parents of small children in either movement, simply because there isn't room in your life to fight the whole world when you're fighting every day just to try and make your child's life a little bit better. And if you're not in the 1%, that means you don't have time for revolution. You have to go to work and spend as much time with your kids as you can. The world can go to Hell, as far as I'm concerned. Maybe that changes when your kids are older and more self-reliant, but for young parents stuck between the righteous rage of youth and the indignant fury of old age, just surviving each day so you can give your child a better tomorrow is enough.

Yes, in that there are some things that have just gone to shit, like being able to work with large groups of numbers in my head easily, which I used to be able to do.  Another thing is that it's harder to mentally ""scan"" an object, and create a 3d image in my head, then manipulate that image.  It's not impossible by a longshot, but it's much more difficult than it was pre-hrt.  So, whereas at one point I'd be able mentally pack a car boot with luggage, then do it, now I can map the edges, but the center eludes me most times.  But those could be just a fault of me not using those particular skills that often, rather than an effect of HRT.  

On the other hand, no.  I've not had any cognitive impairment or degradation.  On the contrary, I've found my analytical, cognitive, and logical thinking enhanced.  Whereas before, I might find myself committing to one train of thought instantly, I now not only take the time to weigh all options, but also I find myself thinking of new ways to do things.  I've noticed that in the month I've been off HRT pre-surgery (13 days to go!  YAY!), I'm shutting down a little, almost like my brain is being starved of oestrogen.  Of course, that could just be the placebo effect, but it's mimicking what I remember I felt like pre-HRT.  ","1322699027"

In CS 1.6, there was a command (cl_minmodels) that only showed one type of model for CT and T.


I also dislike the F2P system of League of Legends where you have to unlock game content through in-game currency or real life money. I hate how people defend the system with ""all game-changing content can be unlocked with the in-game currency therefore it is not pay to win."" While it is true that everything can be unlocked with IP, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to unlock.


Now, it's not so bad as a casual player. Because the game is ""free,"" the barrier-to-entry is really low. I have plenty of friends who play LoL and haven't spent any money.


It affects the competitive 5v5 players. Those players need every possible hero and rune combination possible for team composition.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Thanks a lot for the answer, I found this link on Reddit: http://sleepyti.me/ and it says here that on an average a person falls asleep in about 14 minutes, so do you believe that this would be the case if the Circadian pressure and the homeostatic pressure are perfect? Or is the 14 minute theory just a random figure? Also what is the connection of falling asleep with REM cycles. The reason I posted this question was because the other day I went to sleep early and dozed off pretty soon, about 2 hours later a friend of mine called my cell, hence waking me up, Although I shut the cell and tried sleeping off again, I couldn't, and ended up tossing and turning in my bed for the next one hour before finally giving up and getting up in the middle of the night, fully awake. So even though I was fast asleep a few minutes ago, by waking up for a minute or so, did I break some cycle of sorts? If so, then what about the times that we get up from sleep to drink water? How is it that we can fall back to sleep instantaneously after that?","1322699036"

Seriously, now, I think *practice* is the only answer. I only played Aniva briefly during her last free week, but you basically use walls to keep people away, or box them in, or trap them in your ult. The only way you can get good is through practice.

As to RP versus IP, I'm not sure. I've only bought a champ bundle with RP so far. In my personal (and unfounded) opinion, only 6300 champs on sale are worth buying with RP, but it all depends on your viewpoint. If you have a bunch of extra money, go for it. Assuming lots of money, RP is technically easier to get than IP.

Basically, if you want to spend RP on that, and can afford it, go for it. Otherwise, don't bother, you're better off getting a 6300 champ with RP, in terms of efficiency. Personal choice, really.","1322699039"

Macheda was useless but he's still only 19 so give him time. Diouf should be shipped out, Evans is only going to be defensive cover for us in the long run, the da Silvas are way too rash in tackles and reckless in possession, Park is way out of form and Berba either needs more game time or ship him out too. The plus side is most of these guys needed game time and they got that and it's 2 games less for us to worry about in the semis after a busy christmas period where we are going to be stretched anyway with all the injuries particularly in midfield.

The candle thing is called Schlieren photography. Works even better on a larger mirror:

http://www.ian.org/Schlieren/

When I test optics I close all windows and doors and turn off air conditioning / heating. The air needs to be perfectly tranquil.

Some people go to Toys-R-Us and get one of those collapsible fabric tunnels that toddlers crawl through and install it between the tester and the mirror, in order to reduce spurious air currents.

&gt; Probably heated the previous pitch for too long causing it to become too hard which produced the dog biscuit.

Or an ineffective cold pressing procedure. Or too vigorous polishing strokes. Or any number of different things.

Like I said, you should see my current lap. It's rock hard, yet it makes no streaks or bumps. But it's been pressed many many hours total by now, so it conforms very well and it's a very well ""seasoned"" lap, and I polish very gently anyway.

Pitch gets significantly harder if it's cooked too long and too hot, so that it's boiling visibly, bubbles rising through the whole volume for a while. If it makes no bubbles, it's probably okay.

Keep in mind - if you add turpentine and make it too soft, you run a much increased risk of TDE.","1322699041"

I can't speak for the OP, but I usually start with details like that as well.  For example, I might model detailed bits, then start work on the bodywork, then back to more detail work, etc.  It helps me to mix things up a bit and keep things ""fresh"" instead of constantly focusing on, and getting ""bored"" one on particular part of a project.

If you're asking why he doesn't model a basic engine first, then go in and add the details, I would guess it's because for models like this, it doesn't really pay to start basic and then add in details if you can just go in and start detailing right away.  If you know exactly what you're building, it can actually be more work to start basic and then have to go in and detail.

"RPI","t5_2rg3u","Anasha and CrackedCoco, you both make good points.  CrackedCoco, I agree that Dr. Jackson needs real support and new ideas but she has burned some serious bridges as Anasha has pointed out.  It is also all well and good to say that students can help fill the ""responsibiltiy gap"" that you mention - but the leadership plan and those helming it need to facilitate that.  As a student at RPI, such work would be tertiary to getting the education that you are paying for.   As an alum and someone who has donated to the school, I must say that there has been a lot of PR thrown my way - touting all that has been done.  I have received some unbelieveably fancy publications that sing the administration's praises - ""Renaissance at Rensselaer: A President, A Plan, A University Transformed"" comes to mind.  As an alum, I (personally) think this bit of self agrandizing was way over the top.  I am sure it came out of the fundraising juggernaut marketing budget but it does make me rethink donations when money is spent in such a way.

I also remember how Dr. Jackson dissolved the Faculty Senate and  survived a Fac/Staff no confidence vote a few years back.  I am guessing that in addition to the students, she still does not appear to have a substantial base of fac/staff from which to garner support.  There seemed to be a lot of complicated dynamics around those earlier events.

I think it is very reasonable for the Senate to raise these issues.  In business, very often, a person who starts a company is not the right person to guide it into the next stage of growth and development.  I find it plausible that Dr. Jackson may not be the right person for RPI's next stage - reasonable examination by the Trustees is certainly not an outrageous request and may very well be warranted at this stage of Dr. Jackson's career. 

Universities are in the business of protecting themselves and their image (admitedly, it is quite a different scenario but one need only look at what is going on at Penn State right now).  RPI's Trustees should bear that in mind and be proactive in examining the issues surrounding the Senate's request.","1322699051"

I think you should read more carefully, the ""quotes"" are referring to the common stereotype, i.e. Many people say, ""blah blah blah."",  not to what you said. Possible my writing skills are not very on these days.

you said:

&gt;I didn't say boys were more sexually oriented, just less discriminating and more quickly aroused than girls.

That is also incorrect. No where in your first post did you say anything about boys being either ""less discriminating"" or ""arroused more quickly.""
You may have lightly implied it with your STILL ***sexist*** comment about them, ""Stick('ing) it into anything."" But that is not what you said.

Here's your first post, just to make sure I didn't miss it:

&gt;It's not okay. Both are awful. Both are a terrible abuse of power and both male and female teachers should be fired and perhaps do time.
That being said, teenage boys will stick it into anything. Teenage girls are less likely to stick anything inside themselves, so it takes a lot of effort and intent for a male teacher to have sex with a teen girl, while a female teacher would just have to commit a 40-second moral slip-up to get into a teenage boy's pants.

I recognize there are good and bad stereotypes, don't get me wrong. Its just time that boys had some other than bad, I would appreciate it if more people were a little more thoughtful before throwing our boys under the bus... figuratively speaking.","1322699056"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","There's a few reasons for the increased REPORTS of injuries. First off, I think you're just hearing about them more often.. especially with twitter and other online news sources (like reddit). Additionally, the NFL has had an increased interest in diagnosing players correctly because of outside scrutiny. For instance, it's only recently a player will not return because of *symptoms* of a concussion and not just a full-blown concussion (and that's WITHOUT an independent neurologist on the sidelines, so players may be sent back in even when they're not supposed to). Concussion research in sports medicine is becoming bigger and bigger (I keep up with it since I'm in brain research myself) and you can bet an organization like the NFL want the best technology used for their multi-million dollar prize players and therefore are funding research. That being said, we don't know all there is to know about sports medicine. Diagnostic tools continue to become better and better all the while the NFL is becoming more cautious, so I'm sure you'll continue to receive a higher frequency of injury reports.

Sorry for the rant, but the short answer to your question is no. Number of injuries and injury severity is on par with the last two seasons. I have a source better than the one below to back up my claim, but I'm leaving work at the moment so this one will have to do for now. Interesting fact:  Last season (2010-2011) had a ton of reports from news outlets claiming that injuries were up by a large margin when in reality they were actually down.

Source: http://harvardsportsanalysis.wordpress.com/2011/11/15/nothing-has-changed-about-nfl-injuries/

edit: I suppose without a training camp you'd see more muscle injuries, however you definitely do see players that are not originally on the 53-roster that come in because of injuries to starters that get injured at a more frequent rate. However when this data was corrected for size and experience of the athletes it was not significant. I guess there haven't been too many lock-out seasons in the offseason to get enough data for this because I'm definitely not finding it, so take this with a grain of salt.","1322699066"

The rest of the story is about him adjusting to life as a giant tit, what this means for his existence, etc. There are a few scenes in which he and his girlfriend have sex. Like, she climbs on top of him and starts sucking on/massaging his one giant nipple, though that sort of thing is par for the course for Roth.

*Going off topic for a moment, feel free to stop reading*

* In *Operation Shylock*, he was assaulted by his doppelganger who had his prosthetic dick in his hand.

* In *Portnoy's Complaint*, he recounts the time that he as a child fucked a piece of liver that his family later ate for dinner. There's also something about getting a blowjob from some terrifying girl when he was 14, and he jizzes in her eye or his eye. I don't remember.

* *The Professor of Desire* is really just one long fuck-fest.

Honestly I don't see this as a major concern as it is such a small part of a major spending bill.  While it doesn't ""legalize"" horse slaughter, it does allow taxpayer funding of inspecting horse meat plants because the inspection is required to market the product...more or less.  With this those companies that want to produce horse meat can now lobby Washington to pay for the inspectors.

The article itself is making some huge assumptions.  While there is not real market for horse meat in this country there are other countries that do eat it and these would be the market.  My question is, is there really that big of a market that these countries need imported horse meat from a country relatively more expensive than other places?  I can't answer that but the article is assuming that this bill will pave the way for a multitude of horse meat processing plants to spring up.

Another assumption is that processing horses for meat is somehow more inhuman than say, beef.  It's all the same - horses won't be treated any different which is to say poorly.

Basically this chick has done the same thing to multiple (5?) others. She brings them close, teases them, and then when things are getting serious, she backs away. She has done this with one of my closest friends as well (the one she friend-zoned in the OP). Not only that but she is still hung up on her ex (same one who she mentioned went to see) confessing that she would drop anyone at anytime if he came back into her life. Also, the final straw, she has a FWB type deal going on with someone as well. 

This all scares me, but I still am not sure what to do about it. I think the best thing is just to let this fizzle out and make nothing more of it. Awaiting another eye opening post from Brutal_Truth.  ","1322699082"

One thing you're completely missing out on is the daily Alch transmute.  Which is anywhere from 150g profit to 4x that if you get a proc.  Not sure what you're doing with your carnelians, but you shouldn't be making the weapon and DEing them.  Way more profit in sending them to an Alch, transmuting(again chance at getting 5 for the price of 1) them, and sending them back to your JC to cut them.    
  
There's also the inscription market, but its very cutthroat and takes a long time to get all the glyphs(2+ months of daily research + 57 books of mastery to find).  However, since you can play both Horde and Ally you can play with pricing on both sides.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","I agree with you that portfolio/experience/etc is what qualifies one for a real job by today's standards, but we're talking about Mojang, a small company that hired friends and tries to keep a friendly and small atmosphere. And if you think Notch is the only one (if at all) making the decision here, you'd be wrong. Carl Manneh is the CEO, while Notch is the main (and original, as you know) developer of Minecraft. It's Carl's decision, but I'm sure others had influence. 

The actual qualifications I believe she has is the after-hire experience with MineCon. She was the main coordinator, organizer and planner of MineCon, with Vu Bui handling the setup and a lot of behind the scene stuff. I don't care if she had zero qualifications to work at Mojang, however; I do know that MineCon was extremely successful and fun, and Lydia was an extremely vital part of that success.

As a MineCon agent (volunteer), I interacted with Mojang a lot, and this included Lydia. As you know, people get grumpy when under stress, but not Lydia. She always brought a bright attitude into the room, and knew exactly how to handle situations. Yes, she made mistakes as any human would, but overall she was amazing at what she did.

&gt;You'll learn this some day.

I'm 18, and I'm guessing you're much older than me, so we obviously see things differently. I truly believe that employment should be based on performance. I know this isn't how most companies operate, because they want a piece of paper that says the potential hire knows what they're doing. If a company has the opportunity to defy this standard, and instead make the decision that they think a person is right for their company regardless of official qualifications, that's great! Lydia is very fortunate to have been hired by Mojang, and I'm jealous for many obvious reasons. That doesn't mean she's any less of a worthy Mojang director of fun.

&gt;As it stands, she obviously doesn't know anything about the game or community and got her job because Notch needed a pretty face to front Minecon

Her first Minecraft video was a year ago, and she uploaded fairly frequently, and by the looks of it interacted with other lots of other Minecraft players. I would call that knowing the game and community. It's probably true that she hasn't immersed herself too deep in the internet Minecraft community like r/Minecraft and Minecraft Forums (which would probably be partly because of the hate which is thrown her way). And yeah, I'm sure Mojang wants a pretty face, and a personality to boot!

&gt;Don't pretend otherwise and we're all peachy.

I must warn you; I believe levels of unpeachiness are rising.

Spartans were all about working as a team and moving forward as one cohesive unit in the Phalanx, an unbreakable wall that untrained armies couldn't get through. Their round shields were also meant to protect not themselves but their ally to their right, like an ultimate showing of teamwork. They would also carry their dead on their own shield which is the famous Spartan saying ""Come back with your shield, or on it."" Which was their way of saying die in battle, never surrender so from holding those belts you could have the perspective of come back with those belts or die trying.

 I think this belt is very symbolic and meaningful and if the tag team division was amped up the prestige would follow. 

A really good tag team feud is all it took to get people interested in it again after Edge and Christian went against the Hardy's in the first tag team ladder match.

Seriously.  If you're playing on normal, it's hard to screw it up.  Harder difficulty requires maybe a little more attention paid, but do what you like.  If you like swords, I'd probably put perks in the weapon skill and armor skill of your choice--whatever looks cool or you think you'll get use out of--and if you're having a hard time deciding, you can save them up for later.

My main character is sort of an assassin/scout and has all but the last sneak perk, 5/5 and the two weapon perks for one-handed, the left side (except slow time) perks for archery, a handful of light armor perks, and then a ton in enchanting, smithing, alchemy, and a couple destruction.  I intend to finish up with what I want in destruction and light armor and then nab a few in illusion (up to silent spell) and then maybe some alteration; not really totally sure.  

I'd point out, though, that at first spending your perks in your ""non-combat"" skills like smithing or enchanting will make things harder because you'll be leveling enemies without leveling your own combat abilities, but in the long run when you max out these skills the gear they make will crack the difficulty curve wide open, so don't go nuts until you're willing for the game to get easy.","1322699110"

Say, you can catch five at a time and abide by his will and paint three, because, fuck, hounds (the only animal ol' Charlie likes more than pigeons). When he comes down from all the booze and cocaine and various other chemicals, he's chilling out in the afternoon by feeding his lovelies and admiring them fucking rats with wings, until realising some are more yellow than the whole damned Chinese dynasty (he is racist like that). After you explain him what has happened last night, he laughs it off and tells you to bleach the painted ones. Could say The Machine has a reaction against yellow pigeons and, hey, who can blame him? Fuck chinks. Now, the problem is you can only catch five pigeons out of a thousand and you only want those three. It is possible, but needless to say, you're gonna miss a lot of parties.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I don't think you're missing anything other than that I agree completely with you.  Of course this amount can't provide a fully comfortable life, however, it should cover those things we don't allow people to go without now, ie, education, health care, social security, and food.  We have programs to provide all those things for those who can't afford it.  However, being specific programs, run by beaurocracies, they distort economies and introduce inefficiencies.  

By ensuring people get enough that they can handle a minimum of these needs via the free market - ie, ensuring they have some amount of *power* (ie, money) to make choices and thus drive competitors to provide decent services - we can drop all those government services.  People who don't want to work will have to sacrifice quite a bit to live on the stipend only, getting only high-deductible health care options, meager housing, simple or no educational services, and very modest food/entertainment items.  If they go and get pregnant and have kids, they've made their situation even worse, because kids don't get a stipend (it only kicks in once you've become a taxable adult).  There's no incentive to have kids.  In fact, after taking away all the tax credits kids give you, there's substantial disincentive.

Of course, this leaves open the possibility of stupid people having kids anyway and kids growing up in crappy circumstance.  However, being able to afford health care means being able to afford birth control.  And having money for education means not having to stay a dumbass.  Probably a generation has to go by for the culture to change enough to take full advantage of the living stipend way of life, but I would be satisfied knowing such people had every opportunity to get by without digging themselves a hole.

&gt; everyone starts life as an atheist

That's an interesting discussion topic in and of itself. I'm sure you're right. But I do find it interesting that every society around the world, no matter how isolated, possesses some form of theology. The concept of 'a god(s)' is not alien to any civilization.

So I have to wonder if 'theism' is therefore a developmental milestone? We all start out as atheists and acquire some abstract form of theism usually by a certain age. We're not necessarily going to buy into organized religion until our formal socialization begins. So, does that mean that atheist, having never acquired theism, are therefore developmentally delayed or retarded in some way? I don't think so (although it might be funny to joke around with the idea). I think what's more likely is that contemporary atheism has developed many of the hallmarks of theism.

I'm going to have to explore this idea further - that atheism is simply a new form of theism. That the ""God"" concept might not be the essential or defining feature of theism. There are some real world example of theism without deities (e.g. North Koream glorification of Kim Jong-Il; Stalinism, etc.). I need to think about this some more and identify what are the essential features of theism. I'll get back to you.","1322699118"

You've changed the whole sentence completely, sure the opinions *behind* them remain the same but they are not equivalents.  For something to be considered abuse it doesn't have to involve swearing or be targeted at a person, *both* of those sentences fall under any common definition of abuse.

Your argument seems to be that as long as you don't swear or direct your comment towards someone it's fine but if you do, you'll be punished.  

* i.e. You want to silence targeted opinions

&gt;Can I ask: Do you think racial slurs should be acceptable for use in public? i.e. Nigger, paki, wog etc.?

It depends what you mean by 'acceptable'  if you define it as:

&gt; able to be agreed on; suitable; adequate; satisfactory; pleasing; welcome.

Then no, it is *not* acceptable, but if you define 'acceptable' as:

&gt; able to be tolerated or allowed.

Then I do.  I believe most people are above such things and are fully capable of ostracising a person for vile behaviour.  In fact we saw a whole tram carriage of people united against her (even if most of them were silent) and upon the video being seen by thousands of people she has been nigh on unanimously condemned.  What I don't support is violent enforcement of this ostracising, whereas you do.

Richard Herring wasn't suggesting Ricky Gervais should be punished, he was expressing the opinion that it wasn't funny and he heavily implied that comedians who used such language shouldn't be supported.  In fact, if anything Herring is basically saying what I am here, nowhere does he imply violence be used  to silence the people using mong.

Half of the threads there are just stupid memes making fun of theists and their claims, and the other half are just stupid people trying to feel superior to theists by insulting them. They don't realize that by claiming that they have the ultimate answer to the universe ""I am completely sure there is not the slightest possibility of a deity or a creator but I have no evidence"" they are being just as dumb and arrogant as theist extremists.  
Glad I found this subreddit as well. ","1322699124"

But I do think this ref is a bit shady.  Do you think it's appropriate for a ref to go to a fan site of any school and post on a message board?  Have you ever done this?

All evidence suggests the ref in question has been posting on TexAgs for 6 years now.  Gathering all of his posts together paints a very pro-Texas viewpoint.  He discusses several things that I would believe only a ref would know, and I don't believe this is an elaborate 6 year troll hoax in the making.  The username registered is strikingly close to his real name, and appeared before anyone from A&amp;M would have any beef with him.  He looked like a friendly Big 12 ref that was just explaining how things go at the time, just like you are now.  Additionally the IP traces back to his hometown.   Add in the funny/odd youtube video and the pic of him in a UT sweatshirt it just seems like there's a conflict of interest there.  Not saying this biases his officiating one way or the other, but I am saying I don't believe this is appropriate for the fans of the conference to have to think about when they watch a game.

And let me just say, I don't believe refs are biased or try to throw games.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","One thing to consider in this is that although they may have had sex one weekend, she cultivated his interest in her since they met.  So there was emotional cheating going on here too.  So, your girlfriend had multiple points at which she could have prevented this from happening, starting with the fact that she felt there were problems in the relationship, all the way up to just telling the guy when he's there that she can't have sex with him.

So when two people try to fix a relationship where cheating occurred, you usually fix the issues affecting the relationship that contributed to her finding attention outside the relationship.  But if the main issue is that she got bored and wanted attention, and sex with a random guy was the means to her end, then I don't see how you can fix that.  It honestly sounds like she was just grasping at straws when listing the issues she has in your relationship, because they aren't even that big.  In fact, they're somewhat easy to solve *if you communicate*.  The fact that she decided to cheat on you to solve her issues before even attempting any sort of communication on her end doesn't bode well for the future of this relationship.","1322699129"

The way it was explained to me was that many are afraid of the being forgotten, and in someway their culture (even extremely bastardized) still lives on as a mascot. In my small world view most are ok with that. In addition to this they can support their own culture through these teams, as my Grand Father was a Redskins fan and loved games against the Cowboys.

If you think about it most team mascots are chosen to support and honor the people it is, I don't think Greeks get too upset about a team named Trojans, Irish don't mind the Fighting Irish. Do the Dutchman, Quakers, Celtics, Texans have a problem being team mascots? I doubt it.

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","This is basically true, though the repeated heavier hits from heavyweights are more damaging than the repeated light hits from lighter weight fighters.  

Another thing to consider is that boxing punches are far more damaging than typical street fight punches or MMA punches since they are delivered with good balance and proper leverage.  I remember reading an article that broke down the difference between various types of punches and boxing punches are quite devastating.

One more thing to keep in mind is that boxing self selects for people with the ability to withstand punches, ie a good chin.  The very nature of the amateur system and the way prospects are handled basically means that unless you are supremely gifted (like Roy Jones or to a lesser extent Prince Naseem Hamed) you aren't going to get very far unless you can withstand getting knocked around, and even if you are gifted if someone finds your chin you're going to have a problem (see RJJ and Naz again).

Because of that guys tend to take a LOT more punishment to the brain than they do in other fighting sports.  It's a bummer but in the end the sport is beautiful and the fighters know the risks going in.  I just wish there was more support for them after their careers end.","1322699133"

"darknetplan","t5_2rju2","&gt;Then I guess so long as you run an ethernet cable between you and your neighbor's house, it's totally cool if you two share pirated movies and naked pictures of children? SOPA can't possibly touch you then.

I'll ignore the sad straw man argument for a moment and address the question.

[SOPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) can't touch you in that case. Did you even read what that bill does? Ignoring the fact that it hasn't even been passed, it does *nothing* to target private networks. You might note that the 'O' in SOPA stands for '*online*'.

&gt;The bill would allow the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against ***websites*** accused of enabling or facilitating *copyright infringement*.

Nowhere in all of /r/darknetplan are people advocating IP theft of child porn. Save your 'think of the children' argument for another subreddit.

&gt; Depending on who requests the court orders, the actions could include barring online advertising networks and payment facilitators such as PayPal from doing business with the infringing website; 

Likely unconstitutional. Money = speech, remember? Not to mention that such a law would interfere with innocent parties to conduct legitimate business, all without due process.

&gt; barring search engines from linking to such sites and requiring Internet service providers to block access to such sites.

Government censorship much? Totally unconstitutional. Google has already take a stand and has refused to filter it's search results at the governments whims.

This project is about preserving the ability for people communicate using familiar computing tools when the regular commercial networks are unavailable. Should the darknet mesh be the only network available in an emergency, there will be no advertizing networks, there will be NO PayPal, and even if familiar search engines were available, they'd be completely ignorant of the resources contained within the darknet. Come back to reality and stop projecting ridiculous abuses on something that hasn't even been built yet.

&gt; The bill would make unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content a felony.

This may be the *ONE* piece that could conceivably apply, but first the infringement would have to be detected. In order for it to be detected, a warrant would have to be issued as the government is not legally allowed to monitor *private* networks without one. Kind of a catch 22, don't you think?

&gt; The laws DO apply. All of them. Every law that states what you can, and cannot, send over any communication line.

***WHICH LAWS!?!?*** So far you've pointed to a single **bill**, which isn't likely to pass anyway. I should point out that there are two laws that supersede *ALL* of the laws you're thinking of. In part they say:

&gt;*[Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)*

That is to say they can NOT prohibit you from saying, writing, or expressing yourself publicly provided you're not disturbing the peace or creating or promoting a dangerous or illegal situation. On a private network, they have even *less* authority.

&gt; *[The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution)

In order to *legally* monitor your **PRIVATE** network, they a) need reasonable cause to secure a warrant, and b) a warrant specifying what they are looking for, and the pace it is to be found.

&gt; The easiest, and most likely, way to force the law on you is to simply say that 'If you are serving a connection, you ARE an ISP,

To which I would say that I am running a private network. The term itself, 'ISP' clearly refers to the internet, which the darknet is NOT. The burden of proof is on them to prove otherwise.

&gt; and you're not only obligated to follow the laws of the internet, 

Again with the 'laws of the internet'. Which laws in which country are you referring to?

&gt; you're also obligated to enforce them, just like any other ISP'. 

I'm not in law enforcement and am under no such obligation. I conduct my affairs legally as do those I associate with. If I found someone distributing child porn on a network I ran, I'd turn them into law enforcement, not enforce the law my self (illegal).

&gt; Do you want to be held personally responsible for every piece of information that travels through your computer? 

ISPs aren't responsible for their users actions. Find me one single case where some asshat has comitted a crime or tort using a computer and the ISP has been held to account. You're completely full of shit here, and this entire argument serves no productive purpose regarding the darknet.

&gt; Especially when you KNOW there's going to be government people passing contraband just so you've got the evidence when they come take your servers?

That's [entrapment.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrapment) You really don't have the slightest clue how anything works, do you?

&gt; [I have a degree in computer science](http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan/comments/mtfij/legal_issues/c33pa15).

Judging by you lack of understanding in nearly everything discussed here, your 'degree' probably isn't going to help you much.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","He took it too far anyways. In real life, it would be more like if you tried to blink to get rid of it, but instead it got stuck under your skin. The bee immediately begins to writhe and struggle to escape your eyelid, but in it's panicked state it only succeeds in trapping itself further in.  As its hard exoskeleton scratches your eye, its arms and legs begin to rub off getting stuck deep under your eyelid; this all happens within mere seconds of it landing on your eyeball. 

And then it stings you.

The venom from the initial strike causes a sharp burning pain that no ordinary cut could produce, you fall to the ground *screaming*, clutching your eye with your hands. As you writhe in pain, for a brief moment you are in shock. Too nauseated and panicked to care about the pain, you tilt your head forward and pull up your eyelid and the bee's lifeless corpse falls to the ground, missing most of its limbs. The pain returns, engulfing your body and blocking out any other thought besides white hot pain, in this moment time seems to stop as all you know is pain.

Words are tools.  They are the tools we use to take what we think, deconstruct it, and then send it to another.  That person reconstructs it based on their knowledge of what the words mean.  This shared lexicon is how we can share concepts and understanding.  If you dismiss a shared lexicon then you are dismissing any effort whatsoever of having anyone understand what you're trying to communicate.

So, perhaps a better reply from you to my simple post to the dictionary would have been to reply with expanding on what that definition means, or instead sharing what you feel the philosophy really espouses.  But you did not do that.  You dismissed my post very negatively and dismissed my reply as well.

"neuro","t5_2qu9b","3rding ""do the neuroscience track"".  Do what you love; you'll never get rich doing science, but there aren't any jobs right now anyway, so you might as well have fun and learn a lot.

A neuroscience degree is probably a good way to prepare for med school, if you want to go to med school.  Check with your university's premed advisor to make sure your school's degree requirements overlap with the usual premed requirements.  Similarly, I have a friend from my neuroscience program who went back to college and got a second bachelor's, this time in nursing, and works in a neuro ICU.  (Probably not the most efficient road to have taken in terms of becoming a nurse, but that's what she did.)

Doing anything fun will probably require grad school, but doing fun stuff seems to require grad school anyhow.  (Although I have a few friends from my undergrad days who majored in neuroscience, didn't go to grad school, and are having a good time, it's because they're making careers out of other random talents/hobbies of theirs.  All the rest of us went to grad school or med school.)  Apart from getting a Ph.D. in neuroscience, some other grad-school options might be: getting a master's in education and becoming a science teacher, getting a master's in genetic counseling and doing that (if that interests you, TAKE ALL THE GENETICS COURSES YOU CAN), specializing in scientific/technical writing, getting a JD and doing patent law (I have a patent-lawyer friend who makes insane money, although the work does not strike me as being very interesting), going into bioethics...  If you go to a graduate program in neuroscience, you can pursue the traditional research-driven academic career, but there are some alternative pathways.  I have friends from my grad program who: left with a master's degree and are doing pharmaceutical research, left with a master's degree and work for a scholarly organization by helping edit their journal, got their Ph.D. but have focused on teaching undergraduates rather than running a lab, got their Ph.D. and are working in public service (doing Science For The Government, or working for a nonprofit with a sciencey mission), and I even know a few people with Ph.D.s in neuroscience who work as management consultants with one of the top international strategic consulting firms.","1322699147"

Sure, Iron Maiden and Priest are more traditional in the concept, but you have to understand that progression and change is going to be exercised by people who truly love the genre.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Simply being there for her is the best thing you can do. I was physically abused by my mom from the age of 3 to 12. From 13 to 17, it turned into verbal abuse. Aside from visiting my middle school counselor a few times, I dealt with the situation alone (I'm 25 now). I've managed to push those memories into the very back corners of my mind, but the flood gates recently exploded. 

For about two months, I was a total emotional wreck when I didn't have to keep it together for work. My boyfriend and I had just started dating when this happened, and despite being in the super early stages of our relationship, he was constantly there to make me a cup of my favorite tea and simply listen. I felt like I was just babbling in between my sobs, but he never interrupted, judged me, or looked at me as if I were totally crazy. We would sit together for up to three hours at a time while I just told my story (the child abuse lead to major weight issues - being clinically obese then doing a 180 into anorexia, confidence problems, etc). He patiently sat there listening and giving several hugs afterwards. We did this for two months until I got the entire story out. 

I'm eternally thankful that he was there and we're much closer because of it. Being there in every way you can -- be it over the phone, via text message, writing letters -- whenever you can is the most meaningful thing you can do for her. Having a solid support system, even it's only one person, is the best medicine.","1322699160"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Psychology isn't an exact science, and neuroscience shows that the brain has remarkable plasticity. Just look at Gabrielle Giffords' recovery from her traumatic brain injury. You can change the way you think, and by changing the way you think, you can change the way you feel. The brain likes to take established paths, so it will always do what it's always done UNLESS you make a conscious effort to change those paths. You have valid reasons to be depressed, but that doesn't mean you have to accept the state of *being* depressed. You have valid reasons for being angry, but that doesn't mean you have to embrace that anger. Maybe you feel that you have a responsibility to be angry, that letting go of that anger is somehow letting people off the hook. I assure you, it's not. For one thing, there's no hook. Those people are blissfully unaware of their crimes, or if they are aware of them, they're probably not lying awake at night torturing themselves because of their actions. They're just living their lives, doing their thing. So why should you hold onto the anger? It's only hurting *you*. When you can let go of your side of the rope in this tug of war, it may not bring you justice, it may not bring you peace, but it may bring you a measure of *calm*, and that can help you get into a mindspace to actually help you take action to solve the practical problems your facing, like employment and your education. Rage can be a good thing if it's gasoline in an engine of positive change in your life. If it isn't, you need to get rid of it. You need to change the way you approach the problem. And the things you're really upset about are the real problems you're facing, the things that happened in the past are just the easy target of your rage that you can't really express any other way. Just know that change is *always* possible, and that the mind is more powerful than anything else, it's really all we have when you come right down to it. ","1322699161"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Two things:

First, I agree, in terms of practicality, assuming she does not get an abortion, you need to decide, ready or not, do you want to be a father?  I encourage you to do so, but I admit I am a woman, and I could, literally, never be in your shoes: a parent at the whim and deceit of another person.  If nothing else, look at it this way: you're going to be liable, financially, so you may as well be more than a paycheck to the kid.

Now, if you do decide to pursue a more than financial fatherhood to this kid, here's the second: as others have said, lawyer up, and get a paternity test ASAP after the kid is born.  Unless you're in Germany, AFAIK, you do *not* need the mother's permission for this.  In the US, test kits are available in drug stores, or sites like [this one](http://www.gfilab.com/) have simply, easy to follow instructions to swab the inside of your mouth, inside of the baby's, send the swabs off, and pay about $80.

Hopefully your (potentially soon to be ex) gf will be less of a cunt about allowing you in your kid's life than she was about starting it, but don't count on it; that's why you need to lawyer up.  Good luck, man.","1322699162"

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I know it's hard to believe, but the lack of weight loss could very well be from your lack of starch consumption.  Starch is one of the most important foods for your body.  The reason why it is associate with weight gain is because people tend to over eat the starch items, and over eating does lead to weight gain.  When you don't eat enough starch, your body has to go to the protein for energy, and this an unnatural process of cellular function.  Your metabolism might be slower because of this, and that also results in weight gain.

Some parts of the U.S. has the death sentence. And it is indeed morally unacceptable. 

&gt; House arrest for rocking the boat to the level that he did seems tame to me compared to killing someone for a crime.

Crime A: A man breaks into a house and steals a families valuable possessions.
Crime B: A man breaks into a house and steals a families valuable possessions and kills the occupant.

Both example A and B are morally deficient actions. However Crime A is more ""tame"" then Crime B. Does that means that I can't criticize the man who committed Crime A because he limited himself and didn't commit Crime B?","1322699178"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;I agree that a lot of the ideas are silly, but it seems like we're isolating ourselves from Christians just as much as they condemn us

This is also an incredibly common complain. ""Christians won't listen if you don't become more polite"".

First of all, this is an atheism board. The posts aren't specifically being targeted to Christians or religious people, and it's not all for the purpose of converting or persuading. I wouldn't expect the tone to be the same as r/debatereligion or r/debateanatheist or r/science. There's a reason they are separate subreddits. There's no reason a board for atheists should change it's content to suit Christians, who have their own subreddit.

Second I don't buy the claim. Many people, including myself, were religious and figured out it was nonsense, as a result of hearing people like Dawkins and PZ Myers openly proclaim it to be nonsense. Giving undue deference to bad ideas isn't necessarily a good method of changing minds. And a suspicious number of people who make this 'helpful suggestion' are either religious, or encourage that religion be given equal and separate respect to science, both of which I oppose. I'm not saying this is true of you as I've no reason to think that, but it's true of many posters who've say as you do. Besides, as I said, there are people who go out there and demonstrate great politeness and deference to religious people as they seek to change minds. That's simply not the function and purpose of this board. We value frank and open discussion over other priorities.

&gt;Disagreeing out-loud and even satire are ok by me, but the latent hatred and spite of some of the posters puts me off.

Then call them out specifically. Some stupid atheist posters here do get publicly shamed. However lecturing the community in general is always a bad idea without specific examples in mind.","1322699179"

I recommend sitting down and trying as many trumpets as you can within that price range. Don't try a whole bunch of high stuff and tiring things on each trumpet, just play enough varied material to get a feel for the instrument itself. You should be able to find a pretty good pro-level horn used (and likely in good condition considering the type of person who is likely to own a pro horn) for a reasonable price. If price is that limiting I'm sure you can get an upper-level intermediate horn for a nice price, but since you're majoring in it I'd recommend a pro horn of some sort.
But yeah, figure out your price range and try all the trumpets you can within that range. Good luck!
Also, each trumpet is different to each person, so while reading reviews and such is good, actually trying it is the best idea.","1322699181"

The switch from resource-backed currencies to fiat-backed currencies, while a bad idea, did have the advantage of allowing us the opportunity to make this simplifying change.

If anything we should just be devaluing currencies by an order of magnitude, dropping all savings, debts, and prices along with it, and keeping the pennies.

Otherwise, I wouldn't say it was insignificant.  [All books](/b ""Ygritte was amazingly important to Jon as both a man and as a literary character.  We find in him a conflicted bastard motivated by duty and devotion, but who nevertheless finds that the love - and sex - of a woman really are enough to render the vows he has made fluid at best.  This is a woman who is officially his *enemy*, at that; a woman whom his people would be convinced is nothing but a savage.  His time with her leads to the complete overturning of his earlier ideas about the enemy against which the Wall is supposed to be protecting the North, and the fact that she dies - possibly by his own actions; we don't entirely know - adds a level of pathos to the thing that would be unattainable otherwise."")

Also, I sympathize with you, to a point, about events in ACoK.  Between the vividness of *A Game of Thrones* thanks to the TV series and the absurd, endless excellence of *A Storm of Swords*, I find that I can't really remember much of *anything* that happens in *A Clash of Kings*, other than [ACoK](/b ""The Battle of the Blackwater"").","1322699199"

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","I just [wrote an article](http://open.salon.com/blog/greg_sg/2011/11/24/at_war_with_bizarro_world) on this actually. 

Conservative and liberal are peculiar words because they frequently reference vectors on that chart, rather than established positions.

I'm glad you mentioned American conservatism, which is distinct. The vector is preservation or restoration of traditional values. In our case that would be enlightenment values, or ""classical liberalism"" -- on which the US was essentially founded, even if they only applied to a somewhat exclusive group of white males. I just had a huge neckbeard-fight with a couple of folks in r/anarchism over this.

According to Gregory Schneider US conservatism is:

- respect for tradition

- preservation of ""the rule of law""

- support of republicanism:

 - liberty and inalienable rights
 - rejects inherited political power
 -  people as a whole sovereign
 - activist government to promote the common good
 - expects citizens to be independent
 -  vilifies corruption.

- defense of ""Western civilization from the challenges of modernist culture and totalitarian governments.""

So, yeah, pretty much the opposite of what we call republican and conservative today.

Liberalism is also a sticky topic -- considering the mantra of so-called ""neoliberalism"" is objectivism, although in practice it's been [state capitalism for us and free market discipline for all the suckers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgFlJjnULh0). As a vector, liberalism is change, generally toward progressive values, like autonomy and collectivism, although that's largely been abandoned.

A Constitutional Republic, however, is supposed to limit what the government can and can't do. For instance, the 4th amendment is supposed to protect the citizenry from ""unreasonable search and seizure"". Disregarding the ambiguity of that, even if 60% of the people think that it's fine for a person to be searched anywhere at anytime for any reason, they should never be able to get that into law. In short, there is, supposedly anyways, at least some protection for the citizens in a Constitutional Republic.

Of course, it's still shitty. Even disregarding how it doesn't align well with libertarianism, we've seen how it devolves in the US with things like the Patriot Act, and obviously, there's no protection for things that aren't directly protected within the constitution. ","1322699212"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","It's actually completely the opposite, though.  In this case, the corporations didn't control the government.  The lawmakers modified and used a little-known law to strongarm banks into making the sub-prime loans in the interest of 'fairness.""  They wanted poor people and especially poor minorities to be able to ""live the dream"" of owning their own home, regardless of whether or not they could afford it.  When the banks pointed out that those were horrible investments and would cause them to go bankrupt, the government said ""Fine then, we'll guarantee them.  Close the loans and then sell them to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.""  So they did.  7 years later, all those ARM's got adjusted and the bottom fell out of the market when everybody started to default.  They closed loans to people who had no investments and no wealth.  They gave them houses with no closing costs, no down payment, and low interest, and when their payments changed after the initial period, those people had nothing vested into their homes and just walked away as if it had been an apartment, leaving the banks (and therefore the government) holding the bill.  This was compounded by the fact that the ease of getting a loan led to an artificial housing construction boom, filling the market with new houses that are now sitting vacant or being sold at pennies on the dollar, which has the added effect of leaving people trying to sell their non-new home in a shitty place because their home is worth far less than they owe on it now.

It's shit all around, and it all comes back to governmental social engineering causing a disruption of the free market.  No matter how many times it's tried, it always fails, and they always come back and try it again.  It's absurd.","1322699217"

I cut him off in mid-sentence and said ""Dude is that the best line you got ???"" turned to her and said ""Hi, if you weren't aware he is trying to pick you up .... badly"". At this point he got a little agitated and did the ""Do you mind I was talking to her"" to which I answered "" Don't worry buddy it isn't going anywhere, here let me show you how it's done"". I turned to her and said "" I have 8 inch's and want to fuck, how about we go back to my place and you get a real man inside you"". The look on his face was priceless ;0. She at this point turned to him and said ""Sorry his offer is better, sorry about your damn luck (yes she quoted James Storm from TNA)"" and we walked away. I called one of my friends later to ask what he had to say (as he didn't know me or that we were together) and apparently he had tryed the same thing and got a massive slap for his effort.

You wake up to the bed rising up almost off the floor. Curious as to the sensation, you open your eyes and look over and see the ass of a 350 pound fatty getting out of the bed. You freeze in panic as you try to remember the night before, but all you can recall is the first 11 shots of tequila.

She smiles and leans over the bed to give you a kiss, and you let her. Not out of desire to receive the kiss, but out of pure fear that if you were to try and escape, she might lose balance, and subsequently crush you to death.

She smiles the smile only a fat chick can, and says she is going to make some breakfast, she's in the mood for some bacon.

As soon as she leaves the room, you kick into high gear. You jump up, grab your pants, and survey the strange place you woke up. your heart sags as you realize it's an apartment. The layout of the place puts the kitchen in between you and the only door. Closing the bedroom door, you look out the window. Fifth floor! Your rightly fucked! It's well below freezing outside, it snowed, and the thought of trying to climb down the metal fire escape terrifies you.  You look around the foreign bedroom. There is a dresser, a mirror, a computer desk, the bed with a wrought iron headboard and four posts. There is a curling iron and a makeup kit. There are also 21 stuffed animals and a doll collection that indicates she wants to have many children. The calendar on the wall has marking to indicate her cycle, including circles on the dates when she is most likely to conceive. Last night was circled.

You hear a voice coming from the kitchen: ""do you want peanut butter with your bacon? Oh, my parents are coming over for dinner tonight, they are going to LOVE you!""

Seriously I went through my profile and added strategic dashes so that those hitting ctrl+f would be unsuccessful but that's not even working.  I would say one of every fifty recruiters that calls me has any idea of what I do or how I fit into the industry.  I get loads of calls for things I don't do, never did or would want to do.  

I this point I treat recruiters like 419 scammers and try to troll them for as long as possible.  Maybe it's bad but I hope the bad ones get canned so people who care can have the jobs.  

Here's my advice- know a lot about the industry you are recruiting for.  Especially as it relates to what people actually do.  As an example a Business Intelligence Report Developer will write SQL but isn't a DBA.  I would say almost no one gets that.  I'm a tech guy and know that pretty much that tech guys move around fairly often and are always looking.  If you have interesting stuff for them (and know who does what to present it to the right person) you'll be huge because that's rare.","1322699223"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Hardware address for a network interface controller (network card), you can usually find it written down somewhere on the box for many devices. Within a directly connected network, the IP address is not how the devices are actually communicating at a lower level. Devices use ARP (address resolution protocol) to ask what network device is using a certain IP address, it will then send the traffic on the line addressed to the hardware address it receives. This process is generally transparent to the user, but you can see the mappings by running arp -a in Windows or Mac, or just arp in Linux. EDIT: I forgot to mention, MAC = Media Access Control.

Kind of like a group of people at a raffle for some big prize. They call out a number, someone responds, then they jot down their actual name to distribute the prize.

There is also a basic assumption that other devices will ignore traffic that is destined for someone else's MAC address. Network sniffers work by forcing the network device to listen to traffic even if it's destined for someone else. This is especially easy on a wireless network where every device can actually ""hear"" the rest of the traffic.","1322699241"

""I come in peace,"" it said, adding after a long moment of further grinding, ""take me to your Lizard.""

Ford Prefect, of course, had an explanation for this, as he sat with Arthur and watched the nonstop frenetic news reports on television, none of which had anything to say other than to record that the thing had done this amount of damage which was valued at that amount of billions of pounds and had killed this totally other number of people, and then say it again, because the robot was doing nothing more than standing there, swaying very slightly, and emitting short incomprehensible error messages.

""It comes from a very ancient democracy, you see...""

""You mean, it comes from a world of lizards?""

""No,"" said Ford, who by this time was a little more rational and coherent than he had been, having finally had the coffee forced down him, ""nothing so simple. Nothing anything like to straightforward. On its world, the people are people. The leaders are lizards. The people hate the lizards and the lizards rule the people.""

""Odd,"" said Arthur, ""I thought you said it was a democracy.""

""I did,"" said ford. ""It is.""

""So,"" said Arthur, hoping he wasn't sounding ridiculously obtuse, ""why don't the people get rid of the lizards?""

""It honestly doesn't occur to them,"" said Ford. ""They've all got the vote, so they all pretty much assume that the government they've voted in more or less approximates to the government they want.""

""You mean they actually vote for the lizards?""

""Oh yes,"" said Ford with a shrug, ""of course.""

""But,"" said Arthur, going for the big one again, ""why?""

""Because if they didn't vote for a lizard,"" said Ford, ""the wrong lizard might get in. Got any gin?""

""What?""

""I said,"" said Ford, with an increasing air of urgency creeping into his voice, ""have you got any gin?""

""I'll look. Tell me about the lizards.""

Ford shrugged again.

""Some people say that the lizards are the best thing that ever happened to them,"" he said. ""They're completely wrong of course, completely and utterly wrong, but someone's got to say it.""","1322699243"

However depending on who it was that carried out the acts, for example if it was a punk teenager throwing rocks through Jewish windows Vs a legitimate anti-Semite trying to send a message, it could be taken differently. If this was a neo-nazi sending a message and trying to almost commemorate the original event (of which the anniversary was not too long ago) than I would think the comparison might be more appropriate but that's something we don't yet know.

"conspiratard","t5_2r2dd","Whoops.  Here's the content in case someone doesn't want to go to the site:

The Federal Security Service (FSB) is reporting today that the “secret letter” sent to Prime Minister Putin by Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda contains a warning that United States President Barack Obama has issued an executive-level “kill order” against US Congressman Ron Paul over fears this charismatic politician, who many believe could capture the Republican Presidential 2012 nomination, is about to expose to all Americans what can only be described as the largest mass theft in human history.

According to this report, Prime Minister Noda first became aware of this “kill order” after a private meeting with Obama at last weeks ASEAN Summit meeting in Indonesia when the American President expressed his “unconstrained joy” over the toppling of the Greek and Italian governments in bloodless coups by EU banksters who installed to run these countries unelected former Goldman Sachs executives.

Not known to many Americans is that the giant global investment firm Goldman Sachs put Obama into office by being its top donor and after winning the Presidency put so many of its former executives into the US government it is known as the “Wall Street Cabinet.”

The reason for Goldman Sachs, and other top American and European banksters, putting Obama into office, this report continues, was to loot the Americans taxpayers of an estimated $100 Trillion…nearly $30 Trillion of which went directly into the pockets of international banksters around the world and another $70 Trillion in lost home values, stock portfolios and pensions funds.

The main conduit of this massive theft was the US Federal Reserve System which during the 2008 Financial Crisis secretly doled out, without the American peoples knowledge, over $16 Trillion to European banks and companies and another nearly $8 Trillion in “secret loans” to the largest banks in the United States.

Causing Obama and his bankster allies to fear Ron Paul, this report continues, is the Congressman’s ability to hold US Congressional hearings on the $8 Trillion in secret loans to the largest banks in America without the public’s knowledge exposing this largest theft in human history and laying bare for all to see the total criminality of their entire elite political, financial and corporate class.

Though the US mainstream media has virtually ignored Ron Paul’s candidacy the American people themselves appear to have broken through this deliberate government ordered blackout of his Presidential run as evidenced by his rise in the polls in the first campaign States of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, which should he win them all would assure him the Republican nomination.

The fears Ron Paul is causing among Americas elite classes appear to be justified as he recently likened the US Federal Reserve System to “drug addiction” warning that the deception it has foisted upon the public will lead to the destruction of the United States.

Ron Paul further warned the American people this year that their nation was becoming a “police state,” called for the impeachment of Obama for ordering the assassination of an American citizen without charges or trial, and stated that Obama had violated the War Powers Act over his actions against Libya.

Ron Paul’s fears of a police state America being ruled by a dictatorial tyrant were confirmed yesterday when the US Senate, in a 61-37 vote gave, for the first time in history, the power to the US Military to hold citizens without charges or trial indefinitely by passing a bill that was written in secret and never openly debated.

So frightening is this new law that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in the days prior to its passing warned: “The Senate is going to vote on whether Congress will give this president—and every future president — the power to order the military to pick up and imprison without charge or trial civilians anywhere in the world. The power is so broad that even U.S. citizens could be swept up by the military and the military could be used far from any battlefield, even within the United States itself.”

Most ominous in this FSB report is its stating that the “assassination regime” ordered against Ron Paul by Obama may already be underway as one of the US foreclosure fraud whistleblowers subpoenaed by Ron Paul to testify before the US Congress named Tracey Lawrence was found “suicided” yesterday in Las Vegas.

The destruction of anyone found opposing the Obama regime and its bankster backers was, also, brought into sharp relief this week by the smearing by mental illness allegations of one of America’s top heroes US Marine Sergeant Dakota Meyer, who in September received the Congressional Medal of Honor from Obama (who called him one of the most “down-to-earth guys that you will ever meet”) for saving the lives of 36 of his comrades, but after he alerted the press that his employer defense contractor BAE Systems was selling high-tech sniper rifles to Pakistan that are being used to kill America Soldiers was labeled as a “drunk and mentally ill.”

So concerned has the Kremlin become about the growing American fascist police state it caused General Nikolai Makarov, Russia’s top military commander, to issue a warning to the West last week that the Motherland was fully prepared for a nuclear World War III and which prompted the Obama regime to state that it would immediately cease observing their arms treaty with Russia.

To if the American people will be able to rally around Ron Paul before he is assassinated by the Obama regime it is not in our knowing, other than to note that in a country where every public demonstration – however peaceful and orderly it might be – is ordered by their authorities to be treated as the equivalent of a prison riot, where the former police chief of Seattle blamed the militarization of local US police forces on Obama’s Homeland Security Department, and where the media is described as being nothing more than a “lapdog” for Obama and his bankster allies, the likelihood of these people escaping the worst horrors to come do, indeed, seem inescapable.","1322699256"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","i think its ludicrous to call doing something in the more efficient way ""lazy""

if i want to live in a liberal country i have to make my current country liberal? rather than just go to an existing liberal country and live there?

this argument is the equivalent of saying ""people who buy [any food item] are lazy, they should make their [any food item] from scratch.""
So judging by you attitude towards politics, you must make everything you eat from scratch. 


Though you probably don't, because you don't want to dedicate that amount of time to cooking, which is likely not something you particularly enjoy. --this is how a lot of people feel about politics. why waste all my time fighting for change when its already happened over there?

this is not a lazy thought, everyone has this thought everytime they buy something instead of make it. 

you said in one of your comments that you could either take a year to move to another country or a year to effect change locally. thats a nice sentiment but if i went from here to iceland thats a major change, but the amount of change i could personally create in a year is obviously incredibly smaller.(this is where the efficiency difference is most obvious)

If you had said that moving to a different country is less-than-patriotic or is a failure on the person to perform their civic duty, i wouldn't have said anything, but lazy is simply an invalid argument for this.","1322699271"

I haven't been asking people to use them for that long, so i still run into some issues.

&gt;Like does it offend you when someone who knows you are a man uses a feminine pronoun?

Only if they do it purposefully/maliciously, like my father does.

&gt;Do you correct people?

I do in different ways. For people that don't know me well, and call me she, I correct them as an assertion. For my friends that consciously try to use male pronouns, I correct them jokingly when they slip up, often putting an offended look on my face and saying ""What the fuck did you just call me?"" and then laugh when they start apologizing.

&gt;How do you feel about people using old nicknames for you

It doesn't really bother me. I went from Ashley to (ironically) Shawn, so when my friends call me Ash it doesn't offend me.

The only thing you can really do for your friend is acknowledge him as a person, not a set of genitals. Explain that when you mess up with your vocabulary, it's because you're used to calling him something else, not because you're trying to undermine his struggle.

And tell him there are people that know what he's going through, and are able/willing to talk to him and help. There are great resources out there for trans individuals, and sometimes where they come from is surprising.","1322699274"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","If they aren't itchy or painful, it's likely internal hemorrhoids that are prolapsing out your anus.  True external's should be painful.  Unfortunately, without a medical procedure - it's unlikely you'll get rid of the hemorrhoids completely.  How do you know you have hemorrhoids?  Is there blood in your stool?  Have you felt it?

Is it there all the time or only when you strain (i.e. pooping)?  I ask because, these prolapsed internal hemorrhoids are more likely to clot up which can be quite painful and may require medical attention.

You CAN minimize risks, though.  Key is regularizing your stool habits.  Add fiber (like metamucil) to your diet and drink plenty of water so that your are having soft stools at least around 1 a day.  Avoid constipation and straining!  Studies have shown this reduces the likelihood of bleeding and even reduces the size of the hemorrhoids.

I think it is likely you will have some bleeding with anal sex.  If your partner and you are okay with that... go for it, I guess, I dunno.  BUT USE A CONDOM.  You may be more susceptible to STDs (read: HIV) because of easier access to your blood stream.

"ladybonersgw","t5_2t4jw","Thanks mate, I agree with your thoughts on how this might end up a bit of a confused subreddit. I think the problem is you have some guys coming in from ladyboners and some coming in from gonewild which have entirely different motives.

The way I saw it was a place for guys posted on ladyboners to have a bit more fun and bask in the lady love.  

I don't like to generalise, but I know that the ladies judge on faces, smile, clothes and style much more than guys do. If the ladies want to see some dick, there's an option to click male only on gonewild (the [m]) at the top. I think they come here for something a bit different, and that's what we should be giving them.

So it's physical presence is enough to affect the way our brain operates.

And you better damn well hope your brain is still firing while you're under. So far as I've heard you don't come back from a total brain death.

2. Doesn't snap-to the top/bottom/right/left borders of the screen when dragged close to them.

3. Requires the user to click a box in another window to move the primary window. Why? Just do it like every other always-on-top borderless program and have the top bar appear when you mouse over the window, which you can click and drag just like a normal window.

4. Unless I'm missing something here, you can't resize the window (other than fullscreen), which is extremely strange to me.

5. Mousewheel doesn't control volume.

You have the length to play with 4-5 stranders, or even braid it up in a crown. You need strong fingers and shoulders, but you'll get them with time. 

I learned how here: http://www.dreamweaverbraiding.com/Braiding_Tips.htm

Hair can grow back quicker than you may think if you do decide to cut it off, so if you want to go that direction don't be too afraid. You look like you have a pretty oval face and nice eyes so you'd probably look pretty good with a shorter do. I did not, so I'll keep it long for now :x

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","First off, *get your surgery and get healthy* before working out.
Secondly, work out in machines which isolate the knee joint and eliminates force over the joint (seems you are already doing this).
Thirdly: Kettlebells. They're awesome for effectively working out your lower body, without jacking up your knees.
Just do [swings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_XjJjLc7NE) for starts, it's the foundation for the entire kettlebell routine, and when you have it down you are well on your way. Work on form, as always, in your case I'd start out with the 8kg bell first until you have the basics down. Then you can add more kettlebell exercises and weight!

"pokemon","t5_2qmeb","Possible Spoilers:

 I completely agree with you, I've always been attached to Pokémon, and as funny as that might seem, it just has a really nostalgic effect on me and I don't think it'll ever go away. I just recently came up with the idea of catching up on the anime as I used to watch it as a kid but due to the T.V. schedule I never was able to really follow the show. That was a few weeks ago, and I spent a lot of time catching up to the newest English dubbed episodes, which has been a really great experience. I enjoyed seeing Ash grow as a trainer(however small the growth was) gradually through each new region, and became more and more interested in the story. I always liked it when he would bring back some of his older Pokémon because it seemed like it brought the story together more, so when I got to the Black and White episodes it made me sad to see Ash reverted into a clueless trainer who as of yet-as far as I am in the series-has not mentioned really any past experiences beyond coming to Unova. However as I got a little more into the story, it started to make me feel a little better once Ash started to seem more like his normal self, although he still has these tendencies to forget whatever it is he's learned previously. I'm really hoping this isn't any type of permanent change, and only a way of reintroducing the series to new viewers, even though I have to acknowledge the fact that the show is more aimed for kids in a way(market-wise), I can't imagine they would get rid of years of story progress and depth just to start it all over again. I've been wanting to say some of that, and there's just so much to say on it that  it would take a while to elaborate on every aspect, but I think you gave a nice summary of each region and hopefully Black and White will continue to get better as the series progresses.","1322699315"

Question: Why was Ben Amos playing? I thought Fergie would of *at least* played Kuszczak with all the recent commotion going on with him not getting enough play time. Kuszczak isn't great, but still.

I thought this was a piss poor performance. Jesus fucking christ where was the passion!? Every fucking time United went on the attack everyone just stood there ball watching. No one made any runs, no one opened up the defence, no one showed that we are Manchester United. Pathetic.

After about 5 minutes of the ball going from wing to wing eventually it led to a 30 yard shot... off target.

None of the young lads showed that they have potential and perhaps it's a bit of a wake up call to Fergie to show that perhaps these guys aren't as good as he thought they were.

I don't understand why Park isn't played more often. His work rate is phenomenal and I think he is quite underrated. I would have Park play centre mid over Carrick, Anderson, Gibson any day.

But....to attempt to answer your question, you have to tackle this from a bio-psych perspective.  Remember that guys like a challenge and being told that you want 'just friends' or intentionally not appearing flirty is almost like inviting them to a challenge.  Men hitting on women tend to self-select, and by that I mean that if you appear too good for them, they'll often not even bother.  Men who feel (and often rightfully so) that they can't keep up will fall away, and those who feel confident enough will actually approach you.  If you can get only the best of the best to approach you, chances are you'll be dealing with guys who are confident enough to not need to be more than friends with you (because there's always another girl they can meet for that).  And maybe even you will be interested in being more than just friends with some of them.  To keep these kind of male friends around, you need to show them that you are more valuable as a friend than as a lover (for example, provide them with a girls opinion on their situation, help them find other girls, etc.)

I've seen many forums where people were civil and produced quite wonderful discussion. You can find examples of these types of forums are made up of fansites (more specifically literature fansites (like ASOIAF), where like-minded people can come together and muse about things they like and things they didn't/don't like. Furthermore, discussion about things 'no one' knows (predictions about the next book in the series, interpretation of a book, etc) will generally have more productive discussion because there isn't really a 'right' answer.

So in the end, environment, topic, and the group of people that get together to discuss them all affect how likely a flame war will occur. The anonymity of the internet also contributes to the problem. Take that away and make an environment where everyone has the same goal where everyone is an equal, and I feel like there won't be much flaming if at all.","1322699316"

A xor 0 = A
A xor 0 = /A

As you may have noticed, the Add/Sub signal is connected to the curry input of the adder. The purpose of this connection is to add 1 to the complemented value and compute it's 2-complement without any additional gate or circuit:

Let A(0..3) be the input that's going to be inverted and B(0..3) the other input of the adder. The output of the adder S(0..3) has the following expression:

S(0..3) = A(0..3) + B(0..3) +Cin

with Cin the curry input.

If SUB=0, we will have S(0..3)=A(0..3) + B(0..3). 

If SUB=1, the expression of S(0..3) is as follows:

S(0..3) = /A(0..3) + B(0..3) +1 = (/A(0..3) + 1) + B(0..3)  = B(0..3) - A(0..3)

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","I use both alcohol and canister stoves when I go backpacking. I use my alcohol stoves when I go on solo, 3-season trips and I just need to heat up two or three cups of water. Typically, I carry either a [SuperCat Stove](http://jwbasecamp.com/Articles/SuperCat/index.html) or a [Tea Light Stove](http://zenstoves.net/TeaLight.htm). I like them because they're simple, light, and cheap. Also, I agree that not having to deal with canisters on short trips is nice.

On longer trips or group trips, when we're doing more than just heating water or heating up larger amounts of water, I still prefer a canister stove. Also, during the winter months, I use an inverted canister stove like an [MSR WindPro](http://www.rei.com/product/695263/msr-windpro-stove).

I'm a big fan of alcohol stoves, but just like almost any piece of gear, there are trade-offs and certain conditions where it's better to use other types of stoves.","1322699319"

And i was thinking thag although ads help companies earn more revenue through the products they sell, they spend a shitload of money on them as well sometimes.  Five guys fast food chain, for example, has never had a budget for advertising and not only are they doing spectacularly, theyre the fastest growing chain in the country in terms of number of stores several years in a row.

To look as muscley as a random game character you would have to lift with high intensity almost every day, and even then it would take years (if it is as all physically possible, this depends on the character of course). Women are told that they can be badasses without looking like Schwarzenegger (sure they are not obese but they usually don't look overly exercised either).

The main problem I see regarding the attire is that it is simply unrealistic. I don't see the sexism, as they seem to make characters evenly beautified and evenly conform to standards.","1322699332"
"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","*So, Boba Fett was clearly on the Super Star Destroyer with Darth and the other Bounty Hunters - how sad must if be for him that not only is his dad is dead, but theres litterally THOUSANDS of clones of him walking around?*

I imagine he'd see them more as tainted clones of his father. Boba was completely unaltered, so would have been different from the rest of the clones, and also had the emotional and physical advantage of being raised and trained by Jango.

Furthermore, soon after the start of the empire, Stormtroopers were created from a wide variety of clone templates, to dilute the pool and reduce the chance of any uprising. Also, the Imperial Fleet started recruiting all kinds of humans.

*If all of the clones were clones of Jango Fett, why'd they keep calling that one, ""Cody""?*

Because ""Cody"" was that particular commander's designated name.

*How come gravity NEVER seems to be an issue on any planet, no matter its size, or distance from a sun or suns, or even in ships?*

This one's probably just ""Because sci-fi films, that's why"".

*So, Anikin falls into a pit of lava, and he spends the rest of his life in a life support suit. Is the cape really nessecary?*

Only if you want to be a badass, which Vader obviously does.

"oblivion","t5_2qs10","Each attribute (except for Luck) has 3 skills attached to it.

Strength: Blade, Blunt, Hand to Hand    
Endurance: Armorer, Block, Heavy Armor    
Speed: Athletics, Acrobatics, Light Armor    
Agility: Security, Sneak, Marksman    
Personality: Mercantile, Speechcraft, Illusion    
Intelligence: Alchemy, Conjuration, Mysticism    
Willpower: Alteration, Destruction, Restoration

If you want to get +5 for an attribute during your level up you should raise that attribute's skills by 10 points collectively before you are told to sleep and level up (e.g., for Strength, it might be Blade +3, Blunt +6 and HtH +1; therefore, 3+6+1=10).

For each level up you'll be able to increase 3 attributes, meaning you'll need to increase 30 skill levels. 10 for each attribute.

Of course to level up you need to increase your major skills by 10. Meaning that you should increase 10 major skills and 20 minor skills for efficient levelling.

For example:    
You want to increase your Strength, Endurance and Speed, and your major skills include Blunt, Block and Light Armor.

 |Strength | Endurance | Speed | Total 
:--|:--:|:--:|:--:|--:
**Major** | *Blunt* +7 | *Block* +3 | *Light Armor* +0| +10
 | Blade +2 | Armorer +1 | Heavy Armor +6 | 
 | Hand to Hand +1 | Heavy Armor +6 | Acrobatics +4 | 
**Total** | +10 | +10 | +10 |

All the minor skills should be done before you're done with the last of your major skill. You MUST choose your major skills carefully.

You don't have to sleep immediately. You can keep going and sleep later to level up twice, thrice and so on (you have to sleep twice, thrice and so on). Just keep track of your skill increases.

Additionally, you can always go over on your minor skill, but I should I remind you that the higher your minor skills are the harder it is to level it up later. So if you do go over don't go over too much.

Personally, I increase Endurance, Speed and Strength first.    
Endurance since the higher your endurance during level up the higher is your HP increase for that level up.    
Speed since you can't help but increase your Athletics and Acrobatics skill by walking and jumping/falling. So, might as well.    
Strength so you can carry more stuff. My character is fighting type.","1322699340"

Americans regularly repaired their own cars, fixed their radios, cobbled together solutions with what was available, mended, and 'made do.'

There is a very large difference between ""ideas"" and ""insulting for insulting's sake"". Insults will happen, and I don't mind when I see an insult here and there so long as there is an actual proactive reason for it. From what I've seen in the past year that I've been on this site, the insults that come from some of /r/atheism's members have no proactive reason other than to subconsciously/blatantly say ""I'm better than you"".
That has no place, regardless to who is saying/where it is being said.  Only immature fools need the self gratifying praise that comes from putting down others in that fashion.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe","Here's a breakdown of my monthly expenses:

I make 3,200 a month, get 2,400 after tax.

1175- rent. I live in a 1bedroom in Los Angeles.

100- savings account

150- phone and car insurance

160- groceries $40/week

500-700 loans

200- spending money so I can reward myself.

I live with my girlfriend, who is still attending University, and she helps pays the utilities which average around 200 a month. She also pays for entertainment and eating out so that helps a lot. 

I know 500-700 a month is very aggressive for loans, but I liked to be debt less in two years. It fluctuates depending on how often I go out every month (friends Bday, etc.). I try to always strive for the 500 minimum. I have about 10,000 left to pay off and being debt free is my main short term goal.

The thing that kills me is the rent. After my lease is up, I plan to find another place for about $200 less which would help accelerate how fast I pay down my student loans. It also determines how soon after that I can start saving up for the down payment on a house/condo.

My main tip is to have some wiggle money (100-200 a month) where you can reward yourself for sticking to your budget (AND STICK TO YOUR BUDGET). It makes it much easier that way.

The entire notion of an epiphenomenal tag for a truth just reeks of being nothing more than a way of changing the tone of the message from scientific to theological without altering the content of that truth.

Truth is fundamentally a comparison between how you expect the world to work, and how the world actually works. ""There are four sheep in that field"" is true if four sheep are in that field. I fail to see how ""all truth is God's truth"" can be true in any meaningful sense like the previous statement. We can't look in the field and count the sheep, so to speak.

edit: am I really posting things that are worthy of downvotes? I'm trying to make an honest discussion about whether or not ""all truth is God's truth"" actually says anything about anything. [Beliefs should pay rent in anticipated experiences](http://lesswrong.com/lw/i3/making_beliefs_pay_rent_in_anticipated_experiences/), and those that don't aren't worth having as someone who wants to find truth.

*I treated you very badly. I was in no position to be dating anyone at that point of my life, and you got a whole lot of crazy that you didn't deserve. I'm not trying to start anything with you again but I would like you to know how badly I feel about my behavior. It wasn't characteristic of who I am, and even though it's a poor excuse, I was working through some serious problems from my previous relationship. I would like you to know I'm sorry, and that I am a better person than I was with you.*

OP, recognize that apologies are made by apologists to let apologists feel better. Not the recipient. You want to say sorry because you feel bad, and will feel better afterward. So think seriously about how he is likely to receive this, before you go ahead. If you think it will resurrect a lot of bad emotions for him, I'd pass.

You used Harper's prorogue of government to prove the Queen's power, but nowhere in your example did the Queen exert or show power.

The PM went to the Governor General with the request, the GG is appointed by the PM, the GG then consulted the Queen's Privy Council, again the QPC is appointed by Canadians, not the Queen.  The GG and the QPC came to the legal conclusion that the PM was within his legal rights to prorogue the government and granted the request.

Actually, you're about an inch off the height of an apple.

Also, if we're going by average height of an apple, we could go by height of the apple tree. For a red delicious apple tree, it's minimum is 10 ft. (http://www.arborday.org/treeguide/TreeDetail.cfm?id=52) In the Over a Barrel episode, you see that Applejack takes up quite a bit of the tree in size relation. This would make her out to be well over 5 feet.

By prodding through Socratic dialogue, the reader is privy to the motivations and thoughts of the hero on a much deeper level. In Phaedo, for example, the conversation between Socrates, Simmias and Cebes feels almost as though the reader themselves were questioning Socrates, who relates to Simmias his thoughts on the separation of body and psukhe. This separation of body from psukhe allows the psukhe to exist in itself beyond death, and this immortalization is integral to the concept of the Greek hero as we have discussed throughout the course. The Socratic dialogue allows Plato to fully explain Socrates’ thinking through an engaging form that encourages mental participation of the reader, not just a narrator relating a story.","1322699390"

"cordcutters","t5_2sa6y","You must be new to this whole TV world. HBO is $12 a month with a cable subscription today. Do you really think HBO would separate their channels out and sell them for $5 a month or $1.99 or whatever you imagine? Really? Odds are their minimum number would be at least $10, but likely $12 to match their cable cost. I said that range because I imagine that is actually what they would charge. 

And it's not an insane. I wouldn't subscribe to much else and who said every channel would charge this? HBO would, their shows are expensive to produce. I pay for streaming Netflix, that is under $10, I use VUDU and Amazon VOD rarely, but those are pay as you use them, so no monthly fee. I like the Blue Jays but live in the US, so my MLB.tv is actually $100 per year, but considering cable TV can be near $100 per month, it is a huge savings. I then use a bunch of other free streaming options and really, all I want is to watch some HBO shows, so it would likely be the only other service I would use.

Let's review my costs with a theoretical, independent HBO GO.

Netflix - $7.99

HBO GO - $10.00

MLB.tv - $100 per year

Cost per month - About $20 with tax 

Cost per year - $340

FiOS TV Cheapest package annual cost at 64.99 per month - $779 With HBO added - $923

That's about the only thing that bothers me... not because he prefers HER over ME, but that it doesn't matter how happy my SO is with me, and how miserable he was with her... it's almost like him being with a Christian and miserable is better than being with an atheist, and happy.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Anyone who doesn't blame Ferguson for that defeat is naive. The manager is responsible for telling the players how to play. It was not individual errors that caused United to lose, though they made many. It was the game plan. Instead of getting the ball in for chances, they go up the wing and pass it back to midfield over and over looking for an unlikely impossible pass. Smalling was the only player who understood it's best to create chances over and over again quickly. Valencia realised it a few minutes from the end but it was too late. Why wait until the last minute to create chances? It's inarguably the wrong way to play. Any of these players is capable of playing quicker and creating more chances, Ferguson must have given them the game plan of waiting for a better chance. They could have created 3 or 4 chances for everyone one they ended up with. It's been common of United this season that the players are clueless about how time works. When there's 30 seconds left in the match last week and they need a winner, defenders take their time passing it around instead of creating another chance. It's infuriating as a spectator to know that the players are this stupid. United never used to play like this. They have no sense of urgency lately. Maybe the only other argument I can think of is that every player (aside from smalling) was too scared to be the one to give the ball away, so preferred hitting a safe pass around the midfield rather than getting it into the middle.","1322699400"

These are all perfectly straightforward questions.  I'm just trying to find out if your views on tangibility extend to imaginary friends as well as god.

Can you prove that prayer is more or less beneficial than extracting navel lint?  Navel lint is tangible.

If the benefits of prayer are intangible, what good is prayer?

Furthermore, if that is the case, what good is god?  How is god better than an imaginary friend?

Prayer is indeed as effective as sugar pills-- it's been proven so repeatedly.  It has never been proven to have efficacy above that of placebos.  Furthermore, if the person being prayed for is unaware of the prayer, it is proven to be 100% ineffective.  Therefore, by medical definition, it is just a placebo.

Extraction of navel lint actually produces tangible, verifiable results, in the form of lint.

How is what I am saying not being nice?

I mean please, I haven't even told you that your skin was going to be burned off for all eternity because I disagree with some trivial aspect of your lifestyle [maybe wearing mixed fabrics] or anything like that.

In picture 1 the skin on Mei Sawai's face has absoutely no texture and doesn't match the skin on her body from the other pictures in this set.

It looks much more natural, and is definitely more beautiful than the clearly fake photoshopped pictures in this set. Pic 3 appears to be a frame from a video. I'm pretty sure it has no photoshop at all, and you can see that even in this low quality picture her skin has much more texture than in the high res photos in this set.

The proposed bills never allowed for Warrentless wiretaps on internet connections! This is what I am upset about - Steve's website infers as much, when this is blatantly incorrect. 

Rather, I should clarify, the bills allowed for ""warrentless"" wiretapping, in cases where a production order (a different form of warrant) was present. A production order is granted by a judge in the same manner a warrant is. 

A production order can also only be used to view historical data. In order to look at real time surveillance, a warrant would be required.

Secondly the first graph is misleading, it should be a logarithmic scale to assess at a simple glance how well the chart fits the curve, and it should be logarithmic to see the ""spikes"" for the very reason that you are assuming exponential growth.

You will of course run into rounding errors if you try to use absolute coordinates for everything in your universe, but the correct solution is to store your objects in a hierarchy, and store the position of each object relative to its parent.

Store the position of your house relative to the Earth, and the position of the Earth relative to the Sun, and the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center, and so on. This way you still have plenty of precision to differentiate objects at any scale.","1322699406"

I'm glad you reached out to us. I'm so sorry things are going badly for you. We aren't in a place to help financially but will be more than happy to help in any other ways. First off, I don't think it costs anything to get a [replacement Social Security card](http://www.ssa.gov/ssnumber/). Secondly, depending on the state you're in, it may not cost much to get a replacement ID. If you tell me where you're located, I can help you research replacing an ID. Here are the other forms of identification www.uscis.gov/files/form/i-9.pdf that you could use to satisfy the requirements of the I-9.

I'm so sorry things are going so poorly for you. I wish we could help you out. If you'd like to PM me your Skype or g-mail handle, I'd be more than happy to listen or help you with further research.

Best of luck to you, dear. &lt;3 Chelle

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Not to mention the corruption and lobbying that occurs as well.

Hence why no one should be able to lobby. I support unions but I don't think they should be able to lobby. Just like corporation should not be able to lobby. Restricting lobbying for everyone is equal treatment so no one is able to get any favors. 

&gt;I just think that when every teacher is part of a union, you end up with the tenure system that favors seniority rather than performance, which decreases the overall effectiveness of the educational system.

I think Unions can be reformed to evaluate performance and in that regard I agree with you. If a teacher is being ineffective or not doing the job properly - we should get a new teacher. Teachers work for the public, we as taxpayers need to make sure that we are getting what we pay for. I don't want to pay taxes for a dysfunctional education system. 

&gt;This is one issue that the Occupy movement should absolutely focus on, as it could be a nice step in a better direction for our country. Right now, campaigns / electrions are just fundraising competitions.

Agreed, I also think OWS needs to move beyond occupying public space and start occupying election races. Basically do what the Tea Party did but be more moderate and independent. 

&gt;In an ideal world, this would happen

I'm very idealist :) Also, it's what our founding fathers believed and that when government no longer protects the rights and liberties of its citizens then those citizens were obligated to overthrow it. (no joke). 

&gt;Perhaps this could be fixed if our party / campaign finance systems were changed, however.

I think that would be a step in the right direction. 

&gt;If one industry is receiving large amounts of subsidies, another competing industry will definitely want a piece of the pie, and it uses lobbying to ask the government for its piece

Or we just eliminate lobbying all together. 

&gt;This is sort of why I'm in favor of smaller government, because it stops this source of the corruption at the source.

What kind of small government? I have no problem with small government as long as it equally protects property, civil rights and liberties, regulates corporations with smart regulations, does not hand out favors to special interest and provides social safety nets. Are you more interested in the small government we had under the Articles of Confederation? What would your ideal government have?

I, as an anarchist, can not condone this behavior. When I say ""union"", I mean collective bargaining, strikes, peaceful protests, things like that. As soon as violence or force comes into the picture, it is no longer an intellectually justifiable movement. I would hope even anarcho-communists would understand this.

This not only means studying, but also networking, taking advantage of job opportunities such as internships, taking advantage of research opportunities, etc.  All of that matters a LOT more.

That said, people from 'better' colleges do, on the whole, end up in more highly powered jobs.  This makes networking with such people a lot more valuable.  So if your aspirations are *extremely* high (especially in law, medicine, and business), you'll want to attend a top school.  Otherwise, a good school should suffice.

My reasoning for this question, based on my understanding, is that any given bond requires a certain amount of energy to break. And of course, proteins are a huge twisty mess of hydrogen bonds, shielded hydrophobic regions, covalent bonds, etc., each of which will have a binding energy dependent upon its type of bond and the surrounding conditions. So why does the rate come into account, and what effect does it have on denaturation?

I would say that her illness is really what's causing the sleep disruption. My daughter never sleeps well when achy with a stuffy nose. What I've learned to do in the case of stuffy noses is:

-Elevate the head when sleeping. I usually roll a blanket and stuff it under one end of her mattress.

-Run a cool mist humidifier during naps and at night. It helps keep snot from drying out and therefore makes it a little easier to breathe.

-Suction out all the snot before bed. Use a saline spray, 1-2 squirts in each nostril, then a blub to get it out. I like ""Little Noses"" spray. Hold one nostril shut as you suction out the other one, then switch. I also usually give one extra squirt each side after, just to keep things moist.

-If baby is obviously not feeling herself (lethargic, extra cranky, etc) give a dose of Tylenol about 20 minutes before bed. I am very cautious about how often I give my daughter medicine, but I do find it really helps her when she's just obviously completely miserable.

 * NZ journalism in recent years has tended to follow the tabloid form. It's very similar to pop-reporting in the US and UK tabloids. This just shows that they're even just ripping off questions from the US journos. Religion matters immensely in US politics so these sort of interviews may be valid there but definitely not here.

The game is definitely best experienced with a controller. The main reason for this is that the game's input for certain missions/mini-games was designed solely for a controller (dual analog sticks) and this doesn't translate well to a key/mouse which is more akin to a d-pad (WASD) and one analog device (mouse). Personally I felt that key/mouse was adequate for most of the game outside of a few missions and mini-games but a controller for those parts makes the game orders of magnitude more enjoyable.

Are they using a filter, if users say Planned Parenthood wasn't a result for DC and they are instead being sent out of the district to places? Again, I have no idea why, so no, I wouldn't go so far as to say Apple has a ""pro-life agenda"" (notice I didn't say that in my original comment, either).

But whatever the reason behind it, the results given are incorrect and misleading.

So, here's a stab at exact text (ahem):

**Rule 301: Procedures for Adding New Players**

To the most exclusive subreddit of /r/bgnomic, and to the fine redditors therin, I propose that the addition of players (as shall be defined by lawful means), may only be added to /r/bgnomic and to our game of bgnomic if these conditions are met:

* The prospective player must have a reddit username of their own.
* The prospective player must contact a member of /r/bgnomic via reddit.
* The user name of the prospective player must be made public to all other redditors and players in /r/bgnomic so they may inspect the prospective player's history and activity.
* If 36 hours pass after the prospective player's username is posted, without any objections by the current players of bgnomic in /r/bgnomic, the prospecitve player will be invited by a moderator to /r/bgnomic and the bgnomic game at his or her earliest convenience. Upon the prospective player's acceptance of the invitation, he or she becomes a player, with a score of zero, and all rights and restrictions due to players.
* Any objections by the current players raised about the prospective player voiced before his or her invitation must be submitted to /r/bgnomic as a link titled ""OBJECTION! [prospective player's username]"" with any reasons for the objection stated in the body of the link. Discussion may take place in the objection thread until a vote is called for by any players within the thread. A simple majority of players is all that is required for the vote of membership to pass. A failed membership vote will result in the prospective player not being admitted into /r/bgnomic or bgnomic. A passed membership vote will result in the prospective player being invited to /r/bgnomic and our bgnomic game. Upon the prospective player's acceptance of the invitation, he or she becomes a player, with a score of zero, and all rights and restrictions due to players.","1322699479"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Spend less time with the guy.

Never discuss your problems with a guy or otherwise let him think there is something to be fixed and he can be your savior.

NEVER badmouth your boyfriend or suggest anything is wrong with your relationship (if you have one).  

Understand that if you are friends with a guy for more than a few weeks and he doesn't ask you on a date, he is expecting more but doesn't know proper courtship rituals.  You will suffer because of this.

Don't text him more than 1 or 2 replies or have long phone calls with him.  Keep it short and business like.

Avoid being alone with him.

Women are neither confusing nor impossible to predict/understand.  Women are perfectly simple to understand to most mature adult men.  It's the immature guys who want a mommy figure and a lover all in one, and they don't care who it is, who then cling to any female who gives them attention that are the problem guys.  Avoid them at all costs.  Giving them attention leads them on and makes it worse.","1322699485"

Think of it this way - this is a really crude analogy, and I apologize to any transgender people out there in advance.  I'm trying, I swear.  Anyway, imagine you join a club.  There are two positions in the club: hunter and gatherer.  Everyone who joins the club gets assigned one of the two roles, based solely on their physical appearance.  You get assigned hunter.  You go with it for a long time, but as you go on, you really start feeling that you would be better off as a gatherer.  It would suit you better, it would feel better, and really, you identify a lot more with the people in the gatherer crowd than in the hunter crowd (or maybe you don't feel like you belong in either group - neither of them are for you).

"politics","t5_2cneq","You're assuming I am asking for a federal bailout of students.  Not what I said.  Not even something I've considered.

My points on fault have been to illustrate what I thought about your initial ""admit you made a mistake and move on"" comment.  You've said above that you are not blaming the students either.  I am confused about asking someone to both admit a mistake, but that this mistake was not his or her fault.  I am not sure what to do with that, and I mean no disrespect.

In short, I am a fan of a more socialized system of education.  I do not see a purpose to making education in effect only available to those who can afford it.  I also do not think that it is reasonable to demand that those who have taken the risks be without recourse, as we allow people who are upset with deals they've signed to turn around and say ""now wait a second"" to how it was administered.  I think the issue turns more on educational access than contract law, however; college to me has never seemed like a consumable kind of investment or a capital investment (though conceptually it is closer to capital than to anything else) directly.  It isn't like a house, and it isn't like a television.  If we treat it like a capital investment, then eventually it should theoretically increase in value (as houses TEND to over time - not house-flipping time, but actual time living there etc etc).

However, we charge money for it as though it were a house.  We have (or are supposed to have) regulation against predatory lending, although certainly the culture/tax policies do favor home ownership over renting (and that in itself may or may not be a problem).  A respectable mortgage company will work with you if you're having trouble paying to at least some degree.  There is not that degree of flexibility with student loans.  A mortgage company charges based on the riskiness of investment.  Not so with student loans, and in fact everyone has the same interest rates per type of loan.  Naturally, a loan company charges more to people who are a riskier investment because they fear getting their capital back.  Student loans are non-dischargeable even through a bankruptcy filing.  A mortgage company will outright say ""no"" if someone is too risky an investment.  Student loan companies do not do this; basically anybody can get a student loan for school.

What I am trying to get at this that this is not really a comparable situation to buying a home based on the way the money is managed by the lender.  It is, in many senses, more strict than a home loan to get an educational loan; you can get out from under that debt by paying it off or by dying.  This is one of few financial circumstances treated in such a way.  Another thing to consider is that the repayment period on a student loan is comparable to a mortgage, and currently at a higher lending rate than many mortgages.

I think you are asking too much of unsophisticated buyers.  This is not to say that we need to bail out every stupid kid with an underwater basket-weaving degree who went to [[pick your favorite expensive small college]].  As I said, I have not really thought about bailing out students.  I do not generally think a bailout is a particularly good idea; when a person or a business fails, he, she, they, or it will generally declare bankruptcy and try to figure out what to do from there (including selling the erasers off the pencils in the office).  A bailout to me says ""you didn't keep a close enough eye on that industry"" for whatever reason.  I do not think this is a good idea, generally, as it theoretically encourages junk dealing on the part of the industry; we can act badly and Uncle Sam will just help us out is obviously not an attitude we want to foster.  However, education is not like a mortgage for a home, the car industry, or investment banking gone Madoff.  Those are deals typically made by people in different circumstances: they have been given loans because they have some kind of security to offer in exchange.  Again, students are signing on the dotted line.

I am not sure what the resolution is for students who cannot pay.  As I said, I dislike the idea of a bailout primarily because it means we didn't do our job (writing laws/overseeing industry as needed) and that within that sector someone went hog wild.  This is not quite the same as that, however, and I think there is going to have to be something done.  Probably the easiest thing is consolidating and dropping interest rates for students, but that's kind of a separate issue.

I do not particularly think it is possible to solve a problem by only preventing it from happening again.  I agree that we need to educate younger people about what it means to take on that kind of debt, be it $3 or $300,000 (which is fast what you could pay if you did loans for undergrad and then went to grad school or professional school without any funding).  However, telling people ""don't do that"" does not negate the ""tsk tsk, you made a bad investment"" problem for those who are already in trouble; we'd like to prevent the problem and treat it.  It will be... an expensive, socially irresponsible problem to allow a lot of these people to sit under a mountain of debt for their entire working careers with no real hope of paying it all off, and in some cases this equating to these long term loans not even breaking even while still breaking the backs of those that owe.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","The discussion is a comparison between Tegra 3 and the Exynos 5250 because that is the question that was asked. You seemed to have no problem with the comparison in your previous post. It's a relevant comparison because we're still about a year away from Tegra 4 aka Wayne.

&gt;That's why the Apple A5 (based on the A9) is so much faster than the Exynos 4210 in the SGS2 (also based on the A9).

You're confused, the A5 is not so much faster than the 4210, they're very similar bar the higher clock speed for the 4210 meaning it does that much more. The difference is in the Mali-400 vs the PowerVR SGX543MP2. If you have any non-framerate (i.e. not GPU bound) benchmarks to show otherwise then link them, I think you're thinking of the Anandtech framerate benchmarks in which the iPhone 4S performs very impressively.

&gt;The only concrete numbers we have are the 7.2 GFLOPs for the Tegra, and that's only for graphics performance.

The other concrete number is the Mali-400 in the SGSII which is almost 50% faster than the Tegra 3's graphics. It is a safe bet that the next chip will be at least as fast as that.

&gt;24 nm process (smaller than the Exynos 5250)

28 nm. Just as a point of information, it doesn't change your point that this is smaller than the Exynos chip's process size.

I'm sure the Tegra 4 will be an impressive chip just as the Tegra 3 is right now, it'll have very similar single thread performance to the Exynos and about double the all thread performance. The original question was how does the chip this thread is about compare with the Tegra 3, not a fanboy contest (which is what this is beginning to feel like) between Nvidia and Samsung.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","I understand where you're coming from, deep inside your industries, but you're focusing too much on the product as an ends, instead of a means. What about acts like OK GO that can produce something totally novel (and free) with minimum expenditures on production and marketing alike, as a stepping stone to the place where they can headline real concerts and sell their albums in weapons-grade quantities? I'll totally agree that it's not the common route (even if it's been heading that way by degrees), and I'll definitely agree that marketing dollars are worth more than production dollars, but there is *definitely* a role for free music, and it doesn't have to be a sucker's game.

Also have to disagree with why people think they shouldn't have to pay for media. People pirate because they think every other expense in their lives are gross travesties of justice and that they're running on a credit of cosmic karma, so it all evens out. Or otherwise they're cheap and they just don't care, or they think the legitimate distribution channels are dinosaurs, or because they can get media pre-release, or because piracy has become a game with bragging rights...take your pick.

"Android","t5_2qlqh","Or vice versa. iOS5 has come a long way with things like notifications and iCloud.

Look, on an OS level, Android is just awesome. Its relative complexity, once mastered puts an incredible amount of control into the users hands. It feels like it was designed to make the OS the focus rather than the Apps, which is opposite to the approach Apple takes. So I'd say you're comparing the wrong thing. Apple even features its apps in it's commercials, that's how important Apps are to the core iOS experience.

In terms of usability, find a review somewhere that says iOS falls down, and we'll talk. This device is extremely popular and intuitive with everyone I've met from my 3 year old niece to my 72 year old grandpa. They just love it.

Design, ditto. The iPad 2 is incredibly beautiful, and while this is a subjective statement, it's pretty widely accepted. IMO the attention to design and construction grade trump 100% of its competitors. By a wide margin. Form factor, well that's subjective too. 

This is why I think of either device in terms of all-around experience rather than breaking it down into categories that may not be relevant.

I also like to look at the relative shortcomings of each platform, which gives a pretty good idea of its maturity and overall ability.

Disagree with me if you want to, and I'd have both tablets in a perfect world (Right now I have bought and returned both, as tablets aren't for me just yet). But were I to get one for free, I'd feel pretty foolish asking for the Android.","1322699505"

The year after I was a ""slave"" (so, the year after I graduated), the NAACP complained and then they tried to change the name to ""Senior Servitude Day."" That didn't fly, either, so they just had to cancel the whole running tradition forever.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a guy, some of the slickest guys I've ever seen have had close buzz cuts. Granted this [guy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fredrik_Ljungberg) has the facial structure of a demigod, but he's a good example. I picked him because not only does he have a very close buzz cut but his hairline is also receded, either due to MPB or just a weird natural hairline.

If it's noticeably balding on top, start buzzing it successively closer until it is no longer noticeably balding on top. Problem solved! Then never worry about it again in your life. My advice is to say ""screw you"" to the hair restoration industry. It's all largely ineffective and will just have two effects: (1) it'll cost you a lot of money; (2) it'll make you self-conscious about this for the rest of your life. Instead focus your efforts on the things that you will always have great control over: self-grooming; fashion; diet; and fitness.

Once you buzz your hair, a select few women might not like it. A select few will love it. The rest will just see it as a different hair cut. Don't worry about whether your forehead's big or not. Counter-intuitively, buzzing your hair actually de-emphasizes that feature. The perception of a big forehead is largely determined by a clear hairline, which you will lack with a close buzz. You'll do just fine.","1322699510"

ZERO evidence has been presented to suggest that it does exist. If someone makes a claim and provides zero evidence, there is no reason to consider the claim. Particularly when that person has motive or potential gain from people believing their claim.

In this case, we have thousands of people.. some with a lot of money and expertise that have gone out of their way to try to provide evidence to support the original claim. 100% of them have failed.

So not only is there ZERO evidence to support the claim. Everyone that has tried to manufacture/find evidence has failed. And again, we can identify motive for someone to just make up the claim. That isn't necessary to determine whether or not the claim is valid, but it adds to the validity of the conclusion that the original claim was made up. ","1322699517"

The dogs are making sure the owner really is dead. It could be these dogs are actually intelligent and can understand that without their heads, animals are dead. The reason could vary, but from the picture it looks like a very precise action on behalf of the dogs, which should rule out a lot of the motivations.
 
My parents' dogs immediately react to playing dead with much concern, so I could imagine dogs like them being very distressed for half an hour when their loved owner (dog food accessible) is playing dead for too long and the game needs to stop by any means necessary. Since they're not getting up only one option remains, so they proceed with it as delicately as they can. It is in a way child-like, crude and bereft of social conditioning, but utterly logical and effective. - A sort of burial rite.

I don't think I'm giving these dogs too much credit to their reasoning. After all, elephants paint trees and dolphins create and play with vortex bubbles. An orangutang in a zoo is understands that he is imprisoned without having done anything wrong, and of course canine loyalty is legendary. They have a lot of emotional intelligence, as required by the need to maintain the social order of a pack.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","They, like any other publisher isn't anti-PC gaming, they are pro-making money. If they don't feel they are getting a return on their investment, why should they continue making games for the PC platform? See, it doesn't matter if there's a 90% piracy rate if it still means that their game made back enough to pay it off. 

Something most people don't seem to realize is that developers and publishers know that their games will be pirated. The point of DRM isn't to stop that as it's impossible. The point is to SLOW DOWN the pirates. Even if it means slowing them down for just one day, all their anti-piracy efforts end up being worth it for them because there's a massive amount of sales that hang in that balance for that first day or week. 

That's why we've seen games that have come out with DRM and then a few months down the line have the DRM removed. Players who complained about the DRM get to feel like they took down ""the man"". Players who wouldn't buy the game because of DRM will then go out and buy the game.

Yor'sajh in particular, if you stray too far away from the boss you outrange your totems and despawn them, and depending on how quickly you move to the ooze and positioning things you can outrange your fire elemental easily and waste it. (I actually also had the problem with UH and not pulling my ghoul off the boss, I would outrange it going to melee the ooze until I knew to watch for it.)

I'm pretty sure certain AoE effects hit the elemental, and it's bad when it does; it naturally inherits the totem's ability to not be targeted by cleaves or targeted AoE effects, but I believe on Hagaara the lightning chains will *manually* target pets and can tear them right up real quick.

It is VERY rewarding if you have a network established already, but if you are starting from scratch, it is a challenge like no other.

Take some time to sit down tonight and ask yourself how you would connect with 200 people in the next six months or so (and genuinely connect with them) so that 10% of them will either list with you, or engage you as a buyer's agent.  The gaps that present themselves should lead you to some intelligent questions to ask her.

How do we find most of our customers?
What will be our broker/agent split?
Which resources do your provide, and what do I have to pay for?
What do you think my upfront costs will be?

Therefore, Google can be considered artificial intelligence by those who think of it as a librarian. Remember, ""computers"" used to be people who compute - the name was applied to the machines after the people.

"TrueReddit","t5_2qyt6","Thank you - that's a well-reasoned and calm response in what is an often incendiary debate.  

Would it be fair then to say that the crucial difference (between rape/racist jokes and, say, theft/murder jokes) is that it appears that there is (or has been) a significant subset of the population that has impulses towards particular bad behavior and a certain amount of ambiguity or ambivalence in society's perceived attitude towards tht behavior?

That is, murder and theft jokes are okay because most people aren't seriously tempted to murder and because no matter how many jokes we make no one believes that everyone secretly thinks murder or theft is okay, whereas racists and rape-prone men are (or feel they are) receiving mixed messages regarding the relevant behavior and joking (in the wrong way) can push them in the direction of feeling that society actually approves of their bad behavior (and this, of course, makes the behavior more likely).

That actually seems plausible.

It would also seem to imply that if it were clear and unambiguous that such behavior is wrong, the jokes would not be a serious problem (and I think it's arguable that we're on the path to that situation with regard to racism - not there yet, but much closer than 50 years ago).","1322699544"

All British workers have access to unions if they want to join them apart from the police and armed forces (although the police do have their own pseudo union which they are members of). 100% of all public sector workers are not members of trade unions either.

There have been two years of pay freezes for public sector workers. There are another two years of 1% a year rises planned. Inflation is currently over 5%. We worked out that by 2013 she will be £6,800 a year worse off due to pension changes, tax changes, pay freezes etc. That's £6,800 a year worse off for someone earning £25,000. That makes her 27% worse off, and you have the nerve to be sanctimonious about it.

Public sector workers do not have jobs for life. Did you know the British army is making people redundant who have just come back from Afghanistan? Yes, seriously.

Pretty sure the bosses of private companies are elected too if they have shareholders. I certainly vote in shareholder elections.

You could join a union but you're too much of a prick to have done so. Perhaps if you did join a union your workmates would too and then you could strike for better pensions. If your employer stops you THEY ARE BREAKING THE LAW.

Your statement makes no sense to me. Are you saying that sex (the act that ultimately was designed to result in procreation) outside of a relationship where your partner has made a lifetime commitment to help provide for you and the child is is no different from sex within a marriage?

All religious and moral arguments aside, having (premarital) sex with someone for fun might be... fun, but if she gets pregnant, either there's an abortion, a single parent, or a guy who suddenly makes a commitment beyond the ""fun"" that was planned.

Not to get all technical, but this is from a patellar tendon rupture. The big deal with a PT rupture is your kneecap moves, and the angle of the kneecap is responsible for your quad's functional strength. Mine are too high, but nobody is sure if we can get them much lower. This is because I have a rare disease that makes my  connective tissues really stretchy. With anybody else, they'd just jank your tendon down and you'd be good. With me, they're afraid that it either will stretch out (and I'd be unable to walk at all) or tear/rupture again.

""ilovesomuch"" and ""pleaseujustdie"" would both be perfectly valid output strings. With a fast enough computer, you could enumerate all possible messages with length n. Most of this would be garbled gibberish, with a few comprehensible sentences intermixed. The problem is, each string is an equally valid decryption without knowing the key.

Now if we were to double up each bit, we introduce some predictability into the equation. If ""Evil Eve"" knows that you doubled up your bits and tries to hack your message and gets those several equally valid translations of length n, she can then eliminate all those whose key does not fit the pattern. This increases eve's chance of finding your message by a factor of 2^(n/2). If your message is the only one (or one of very few) that fits that pattern, Eve's got your message.

If you're looking for something that has a similar, but more secure effect, you could always try using a custom alphabet larger than 26 characters that could incorporate double letters and such, but it's probably easier to just break up your message into 2 parts or make a longer key.","1322699573"

Not up for a big argument, but just wanted to throw that out there -- the link posted seems to argue that women are privileged, but cites statistics (such as fewer weekly working hours) that are not advantages women have asked for. As a woman, I want more responsibility and hours at work, not less. It's also interesting that breast cancer, which men get, is compared to prostate cancer, which women cannot get. A better direct comparison would be cervical or ovarian cancer, which men cannot get. Several of those statistics could also be reframed and presented to yield the opposite conclusion; for instance, all of those female custodial parents highlighted as ""privileged"" by this author could be listed as ""single parents,"" a negative, by another writer.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","As it stands right now, I am still ""Christian"" although kind of in the same boat you are. I'm asking a lot of questions that had never even crossed my mind before. The thing I realized very recently, is that the people who generally want to bring up religion will not listen to you no matter how logically you present your case. Example: My friend believes people can speak in tongues, and that it is the Holy Spirit speaking through them. I think they are weak minded people wanting desparately to be important enough to have an outward miracle worked through them. As such, I presented my case from the bible that says that people are discouraged from speaking in unintelligible tongues unless someone among them can interpret (1 Corinthians 14). She basically said she didn't want to argue anymore and ended it. 

tl;dr - don't waste your time. I'm learning Christians are kind of batshit crazy...","1322699583"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt; we could still use experimental methods to test the ""rules"" of the simulated world and discover how it works

Yes. But (assuming we knew it was a simulation) we'd then know that we're measuring the parameters of the simulation and not claiming that our measurements are accurate representations of the real world outside.

&gt; then it seems like there's very little point to discussing this - regardless of whether our perceptions come from an external physical world or a simulation, the end effect is the same.

Perhaps you can't prove that you're in a simulation. But can you prove that you're in reality? If not, how is that any different to theists claims of ""There's a man in the sky and he's real; but we can't prove it""? And similar to theism with its Bibles and book which theists claim as proof of their deities, we dismiss them because they can't prove that their books aren't just works of fiction. Well, if we can't prove that our world is real, then our empirical sciences may be based on a reality that is every bit as fictional as the theists. 

What this argument does is simply level the playing field between theist and atheist. It does not prove in any way what a deity exists. Nor does it disprove their existence. It simply highlights the weakness of the core assumptions on which mos atheist rest their theories.","1322699588"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Companies exist for one reason: profit.

This is precisely why the private sector allocates capital better than the public sector.  In a free society profit represents value provided.  When you purchase a product from a manufacturer both sides are benefiting from the transaction.  We, however, do not live in a free society.  Many companies and individuals utilize the government to engage in activities such as rent seeking, and regulatory capture.  These activities allow companies to make exorbitant profits while providing little value to society.  This is a problem.

&gt;Except that those people have to pay more tax to cover the tax cuts for the upper class 

I never said anything about taxing poor people more to cover tax cuts for the upper class.  I said tax cuts on the rich and the poor would both be beneficial to society.  I also need to add to that statement that any tax cut must be also come with equal spending cuts.  If taxes are cut with no cut in spending nothing is accomplished.

&gt;and due to the increased efficiency caused by replacing staff with machines(imported from China - the locals don't even get an increase in manufacturing jobs) and/or cheaper labour, they also have no job to earn the money with which to pay for the suits.

I really find it hard to believe that in the 21st century people still argue for protectionist policies.  In the 1700s 90% of people in America considered themselves to be farmers.  That's how much of the population it took to simply provide enough food to survive.  In the post 300 years efficiencies in farming have led to today's demographics where less than 1% of the population in America considers themselves to be farmers freeing the other 99% of the population to do other productive things with their time.  How can you honestly argue that an increase in efficiency is bad for society?

"worldnews","t5_2qh13"," 
Hillary Clinton has urged developing nations to be “smart shoppers” when accepting foreign aid from China and other new donors, as she became the first US secretary of state in more than 50 years to visit Burma on Wednesday.

In Rangoon, Mrs Clinton warned that powerful emerging economies may be more interested in exploiting natural resources than promoting real development.
 “Be wary of donors who are more interested in extracting your resources than in building your capacity,” she said. “Some funding might help fill short-term budget gaps, but we’ve seen time and again that these quick fixes won’t produce self-sustaining results.”

While Mrs Clinton did not single out any particular donor countries, China is the largest economic backer of Burma.

Mrs Clinton plans to “test the true intentions” of the Burmese leadership in a trip designed to accelerate the nascent reforms introduced by the country’s authoritarian government, as well as balance China’s growing influence in the isolated nation of 60m people.

Amid signs that the regime appears to be opening up after decades of repressive military rule, Mrs Clinton will push Burma’s government to release more political prisoners and end protracted ethnic conflicts as preconditions for any easing of western economic sanctions.

“As Asia becomes more important to the US, Burma becomes more important as well and the costs of keeping in place the failed policies of sanctions and diplomatic isolation increase,” said Thant Myint-U, a Burmese historian. “The hope is that the reforms under way will allow Washington to step up its engagement, gradually lift the economic embargoes in place, and help Burma move in the right direction.”

In March the Burmese military handed power to a quasi-civilian government led by president Thein Sein, a former general. Since then, the government has opened a dialogue with Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto opposition leader, released more than 200 political prisoners, eased media censorship and vowed to implement further political and economic reforms.

“I’m pleased that Hillary Clinton is coming as she will put more pressure on the government to make this country into a real democracy,” said Nyi Nyi Win, a 30-year-old activist for Ms Suu Kyi’s political party, The National League for Democracy, and a former political prisoner. “Things have got a bit better recently but we still have no genuine freedom of the press or human rights.”

After meeting Mr Thein Sein and other senior government officials on Thursday in Naypyidaw, Mrs Clinton will fly to Rangoon for talks with Ms Suu Kyi at the family residence where she was kept under house arrest by the military government for much of the past 21 years.

Speaking by video to a conference in Washington on Wednesday, Ms Suu Kyi said that she supported increased American engagement with the Burmese leadership and confirmed that she will run for parliament in upcoming elections.

According to a senior US official, Mrs Clinton will also raise the issue of Burmese collaboration with North Korea over missilie technology. The official said the administration saw little sign that Burma was making “a substantial effort” to develop a nuclear programme.

Further reform would be good news for the millions of Burmese who still live in poverty and western investors who have long been keen to get into Burma, one of Asia’s last untapped markets, with plentiful natural resources, a sizeable population, and a strategic location between India and China.

The State department said that because of insufficient security in the Burmese capital of Naypyidaw, the official aircraft Mrs Clinton is travelling in would fly on to Thailand where it will stay overnight on Wednesday, before returning to next day to take the US delegation to Rangoon.

You second point is key, because this is the real difference between us (as I said, I am an anarchist myself).  What you are lacking is a class analysis.  An understanding, as I said, that wealth is social power and that the rich use it to maintain relations of exploitation with and domination over the working class (which is itself always re-organizing itself to challenge the capitalist class).  

So, what parts of the state will go away first (or at all), do you think, in a system the rich control?  I think we know the answer because we are living in it.  Protections for everyone else but them.  The only way a anti-state capitalism makes sense is if it is revolutionary, but it would be a contradiction in terms to be such.","1322699610"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","I've posted this elsewhere:

We have this conversation every week, and every week I have to reiterate the same points:

Dalton is doing great. He would be ORoTY running away any other year, but. . .

He isn't doing anything close to the caliber of what Cam is doing, because he's not being asked to carry an entire offense singlehandedly, and doesn't have anywhere near the same number of total yards or total TDs.

    Cam Newton:    239/392, 61%, 3093 yds, 7.89 YPA, 12 TDs, 14 INTs, 81.1 Rating (54.5 QBR, 18th)
    Rushing:       86/464 yds, 5.4 YPC, 10 TDs, 2 FUMs
    Total Offense: 3557 yds, 22 total TDs, 16 total TOs.

    Andy Dalton:   218/363, 60%, 2509 yds, 6.91 YPA, 16 TDs, 12 INTs, 81.6 rating (47.0, 24th)
    Rushing:       23/81 yds, 3.5 YPC, 1 TD, 1 FUM
    Total Offense: 2590 yds, 17 total TDs, 13 total TOs.

    DIFFERENTIAL:  +967 total yds, +5 total TDs, +0.98 YPA, +1.9 YPC, -3 total TOs, -0.5 rating (+7.5 QBR)

And the respective impact of each player on their offensive efficiency (courtesy, Football Outsiders):

    2010 Bengals: 17th
    2011 Bengals: 12th (+5)

    2010 Panthers: 32nd
    2011 Panthers: 6th (+24, +6 vs. 2011 Bengals)

Why the difference in their W-L records?

    Bengals Defensive Efficiency:   15th
    Panthers Defensive Efficiency:  32nd (-17)
    Bengals Special Teams:          7th
    Panthers Special Teams:         30th (-23)

The Panthers also average much worse starting field position on their drives, meaning that in order to score Cam has to go further downfield than Dalton does.

    Bengals Average Drive Length:   26.81 yds
    Panthers Average Drive Length:  34.99 yds (+8.18 yds)

The Panthers have given up two game-winning punt returns for TDs, gave up a 4 point lead with 50 seconds to go, gave up 35 points in the second half and a 17 point lead, and was one goal-to-go TD and 2-pt conversion from being tied against the 0-11 Colts. The Panthers defense is putrid, but Cam's stats are not being padded by garbage time stats, as the Panthers have held leads in 10 of the 11 games they've played this year.

Again, I want to reiterate that I am an Andy Dalton fan from before the draft, and I completely believe that the Bengals have a fantastic franchise QB for their future, but he has not been anywhere close to the player that Cam Newton has been for the Panthers this year. Teams gameplan solely to stop Cam, and have already changed their entire defensive schemes against him.Knowing that he is already one of the leagues' best deep throwers, they constantly play their safeties deep and bring pressure repeatedly against our banged up offensive line, mostly against our rookie RT. They dedicate a linebacker to ""spy"" Cam in an effort to control his scrambles, and they try to play ball control offense to keep him on the sidelines. He is garnering this kind of attention and respect, as a rookie QB who was doubted and questioned in every fashion imaginable before the draft.

Finally. . .and there's no real other way to say this, but Cam has ""it."" Some people want to call it hype, some want to call it swagger, some want to call it charisma, and some want to call it arrogance. But he has that ""it"" factor that sells tickets, demands attention and makes people say ""OMFG, WOW!"" three or four times a game.

Don't believe me? Enjoy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4S5UHrlrz8

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Suggested Explanation: [Entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy) and [the heat death of the universe](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death).  

Pile of dirt and hole analogy. When the pile of dirt is beside the hole it is higher up and can fall down into the hole. This can be done by having something that transfers the dirt to the hole, say wind. This wind is an analogy for entropy. In time the wind will have moved all the dirt back into the hole and the dirt cannot move anywhere anymore, and that is an analogy of heat death.  

Dollar bill analogy. Your friend that you borrowed money from is missing a dollar. You have a dollar. Your friend wants his/her dollar back and you want to pay him back to stop your friend's nagging. The nagging is an analogy for entropy. When you have paid him/her back you are satisfied that you don't need to give away more money and your friend is satisfied that he/her got the money back. This is an analogy for heat death.  

The question now is, who dug up the dirt and why did you need to borrow that dollar?","1322699622"

All of the counties surrounding me have the same practice. So- EMT-B jobs are hard to come by and I'm slowly scratching my way towards paramedic so that I will actually be employable. There is a convalescence agency near me that hires some EMT-Bs, but they *mostly* employ EMT-Is (which is an increasingly difficult to obtain certification in my state). 

So in short, yes. Paramedics go on every call. There are a *lot* of paramedics around here. 

&gt;Either way, I think it is a pretty poor argument that it is okay to be incompetent because there will be other people around to pick up the slack.

Everyone has to start somewhere. 

What about BLS only systems? Shouldn't brand new EMTs there know everything on the first day, too? I think you're being unrealistic.

Furthermore, I think it's unrealistic that simply being an EMT for X-amount of years will make you a better paramedic. You might be better at the BLS skills, but it will probably just make you less proficient in *different ways*. Mostly in that you'll likely be extremely arrogant and think you're god's gift to EMS because you were a basic for a few years. And yes, I've seen this shit happen. Honestly, this attitude is epidemic among virtually *all* new paramedics, but especially the ones who have BLS experience. They're overly confident. 

&gt;Once you start working you will find that being a paramedic is very much like being an EMT, except people actually expect you to be competent at what you do. 

I could do without the condescension. ","1322699632"

i can win my lane, be ahead in cs and kills but all it takes is one person bot lane feeding for us to lose, or one teammate to not know how to play a role so he picks a deadweight champion.

the reason elo hell exists is because players aren't well rounded enough/don't know champions well enough to know how to lane against certain matchups or how to play something other than teemo. 

ELO hell exists, and it's very hard to get out of. I can perfectly well blame others when I out perform the other team and my teammates and still lose. I can blame others and I don't feel bad about it.","1322699633"

They're really quite clever at mimicking LSD (or at least whichever one I took was). It was over a year before I even considered the notion that what I had taken was a DOx. The length of the trip and the onset was the only thing that really tipped me off, but at the time, the friends I was with (who didn't know any better) brushed it off as ""the real good acid takes a few hours hit you"" or ""you musta gotten that stuff that creeps up on you.""

Most of them were pure guessing at best, and Maramros had one of the few comments explaining away a few of the myths.

If the issues with content in minecraft is coding, it's not because it's 3d. It's because of something notch said a long time ago. He said that he didn't want to add content just to add content, he wanted everything he added to work in a different way, be unique, or interact with the game world in some way we haven't yet seen.

This is a very bad move if you want a content filled game, and very good if you want a tech demo. Adding equivalent content in minecraft wouldn't take a disproportionately ammount of time, but it's simply not what notch wants.","1322699649"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I can perhaps see why. It's probably easier to think of them as states in the American sense, and all making up a larger nation state. Currently, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland both have some level of direct control over issues within their borders, fairly extensive controls as well in domestic policy terms. 

Historically, Wales has been a part of England (thus, the Prince of Wales) for many centuries. Scotland is an independent Kingdom in it's own right (a remant of this is that Prince Charles is known as the Prince of Wales in England and Wales, but the Duke of Rothesay [an area of Scotland] in Scotland). It was in fact a Scottish king, James (James the Sixth in Scotland, James the First in England), who was the first king of both Scotland and England &amp; Wales. NI is, basically, a fucking nightmare and has been for a long time.

For Scotland essentially, the next step is complete independence. There are legitimately strong arguments both for and against, it's really an instinctive and personal decision in the end. 

Wales is on much the same course as Scotland seemed to be. However, unlike Scotland it doesn't have much in the way of a route to economic self-dependence. There are fairly large reserves of oil in the North Sea in what would be Scottish waters, so there is a cash flow. Wales doesn't have the same. After the gutting of the industrial sector in eighties by the Thatcher Govt, a very significant number of people are employed by the public sector, to a point that would be unsustainable if there was actual independence from England (and English tax revenues...).

Northern Ireland, because of the sectarian and historical issues is unlikely to ever see actual independence - at least in the short and medium term. It'll be interesting to see how it develops, just as long as whatever happens, happens peacefully.

Some people, usually of the small-minded variety, question why England doesn't have some form of separate control over it's affairs. This is largely because of the demographics, England has most of the people and a lot of the money (in taxable terms anyway). Historically and culturally, the UK parliament has always been viewed as a development of the English parliament.

You'll find that there's little predicatable in how people will take certain descriptions of them. For every Welsh nationalist dreaming of independence, there are those that would prefer reverting back to complete Westminster control. I personally always describe myself as a Londoner, a European, a Brit and then English. There are of course various levels of offence that will people take. I really don't care if I'm confused for a Welsh person, a Scot or a fucking martian. There are others who have killed for less.

We might be small, but we have thousands of years of history to get pissed off about.

"howto","t5_2qh69","First of all, thanks for posting the article, there definitely is some good advice given.  The other things I have a problem with are the suggestion of trying to wow your interviewer with ideas on how to promote the business, sometimes this may be perceived as you being a person that will not want to work within the current organizational culture.  Basically to put it frankly that you will be a bull in a china shop, and come in and try to change everything.  Out of the box ideas are always good, but finding that line of what is appreciated and what is too much is very difficult.  

Also I disagree with the suggestion that you should only give examples of things that you need to improve that are completely irrelevant to the position.    By saying this, the author of the article demonstrates that he does not know why that question is asked.  The goal of this question is to find out if the candidate is capable of self-improvement.  What the interviewer is looking for is for someone to give an example of something that needed to be improved, and then that the candidate actually did improve it.  For example a common answer would be public speaking.  

Q: Tell me about an area you need to improve in?

A: I am not a strong public speaker, but I have recently joined a group that meets once a month and we take turns giving short speeches.

To spend the thousands to go to camps, to drive 8 hours on a Friday night to a game site for a Saturday game, to study deep into to the books to understand all the rules, to constantly have to workout to keep up with 20 year old athletes.

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","&gt;So.... in your eyes there's no such thing as a right to free assembly?

Sure there is. The problem is that you don't like being told that your idea of a protest is actually just urban camping and squatting to make a point. You think that you have to be anarchistic and disruptive to share a viewpoint. 

If so, then you have to understand that everyone is subject to the same laws and penalties. You're not being singled out because you can't have your way - no one can camp on public property or remain day after day. You can assemble, and the authorities can't tell you not to have rallies and meetings in your home, or other private property. They can tell you that you are not allowed to deny the public the right to exercise their rights. Camping and squatting on public property denies others the same access to that space that you claim. This is not a violation of the 1st Amendment, but an exercise of it.

If you were serious about you message, you'd get your permits, and protest each and every day for as long as it takes to affect change. This isn't an option for you because you have to tact, no sense of compassion, no means for garnering support - you're nothing but hollow, empty rage. You're mad that people will stop paying attention to you because they've heard all that they need to hear.

"DJs","t5_2rddy","I did a bit of this before I decided that I wanted to be a little more free-form with my sets than ableton live.  You can definitely rock a killer set with AL, but it is a bit trickier, and you will have to adjust the way you do things.

First of all, you will prob. want a controller.  The APC40 is amazing for this (duh.) if you don't want to drop that kind of cash, the korg nanoseries have gotten some really good reviews (I don't have a ton of experience with them) and the price is right.

Ableton is great and frusterating because of the modularity: you can customize the workflow you have so that you can really make the software work exactly how you want.  I have a customized setup that I always work from, it allows me to alter my sends (where the sound goes) crossfades and effects processing quickly.  You will obviously want to decide in what format you want to work with. there are tons of great youtube videos that will explain the basics. (DJVespers puts out a TON of great material that covers a broad range of stuff, I would watch all of his videos first, he's very clear and concise)

The way I arranged my tracks in ableton are 4 channels of audio to work with.  I would make sure that I would have ""blocks"" of songs that all worked together (tempo, feel, key etc) and color code the blocks so that I would know the general idea of what I was looking for quickly (red=bangers, blue=chilled out purple=funky etc).  Don't try to plan your set linerally, because when you put your set on rails like that, you can't improvise well, and you can't be spontaneous with your music.  You won't be able to react to your crowd at all.  That is not good DJing.

Also, make sure to keep an eye on your BPMs.  Both in song selection and during the set.  When you DJ with ableton, you only can affect the global tempo, so you are going to have to do some homework: every track you put into your set, you will have to alter the BPM using abletons feature called ""warp."" (plenty of youtube videos on it, watch them all!) this will get all of your tracks into the same tempo as your global BPM.  (also, make sure not to warp your tracks more than usually 10 BPM or so.(ex. a BPM of 120 should not be lower than 110, or higher than 130) Stretching your waveforms too much can leave audible artifacts, as well as take all the nuts out of the bass of the tracks. 

One BPM for the whole night can really start to get tiring, so you are going to want to change the global BPM from time to time, this is good, as you can use it as a tool to work the room.  When you are transitioning to a higher energy song, raising the BPM before the transition can really bring everyone up with you.  It's almost subliminal, but quite effective to use.  So keep everything dynamic!

That is all I can really emphasize on going from a strictly DJ program to ableton.  Did you have more specific questions?  Ableton is truly my home base when it comes to music playing/production, so I'd love to answer any other questions you have.  We are all in this together.

Good luck!","1322699689"

&gt;The egg of the chicken we know today came from a less evolved chicken.

Ah...no. Close, but not quite.

Chickens have reptilian ancestors, although the earliest ancestors to lay eggs probably would have been more like insects or fish. Birds may have ancestors in common with some dinosaurs, but probably not the T-Rex. We're talking smaller dinosaurs like the Archaeopteryx. And the ancestor of the chicken wasn't 'less evolved'. Things aren't evolving upwards in a specific direction. In fact the ancestor of modern chickens was probably smarter and tougher than the modern chicken, since we've modified them so much through breeding. There was a period between dinosaurs and the ice ages, in which many mammals and other animals were far bigger and stronger than they are today. The first chicken egg, would have come from whatever particular chicken we'd be willing to call ""not a chicken"", but it would look very like a chicken. That's because there's generally not clear speciation from one generation to the next, we can only step back and drop artificial demarcations afterwards.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Hmm, his last statement: ""the sexual orientation of my parents has had zero effect on the content of my character.""

He can't actually say that can he?  How would he know?  Listen, I'm starting to get annoyed by all this.  First off, I don't care at all what your sexual orientation is and I don't care if you want to get married.  But to say this has zero psychological effect on a child raised in a same sex environment is flawed.  Well, it may be true (although I doubt it) but you can't just make a statement like that with absolute certainty.

I can't quote off-hand papers on this, and I can't believe I'm about to quote a tv show, but there's an episode of sopranos where Tony is with the psychiatrist and they are talking about his daughter and how she's growing up and the Dr. says that he's the blueprint for the future men in her life.  

From what I understand, this is commonly accepted in psychology circles, and until that is refuted as being false, his last statement can't be made with any certainty.

It is commonly accepted among all sexual orientations (straight or gay) that we all are born this way  and your upbringing won't influence that one way or the other.  

And that is true, however outside influences do have an impact and not all of it is genetically ingrained.  An example?  A circumcised penis.  Most women think an uncircumcised penis looks funny, but how can this be when that is naturally how we are and they should instinctively be attracted to what is natural and outside influences be damned.  But obviously that is not the case.

A group of us were with our girlfriends and facial hair came up and the women were quizzed on what they prefer.  The majority like clean shaven but a few liked facial hair.  I asked the girls that liked facial hair and all of their fathers had a beard/moustache.  

I can't say it for a fact, (unlike how the video asserted) but I believe seeing how my dad was as a man, and seeing how my mom was as a woman did definitely have an influence on me and how I see relationships, and not simply because they are two loving people and their sex being irrelevant.

Do I believe two gay men or women can raise great children and have a loving caring environment?  Of course, it would be ignorant to say otherwise.  But I also believe it is ignorant to say it has zero impact on their offspring as sexual beings.  I'm not saying it definitely does, although I feel it does, but I believe it deserves more merit in actual studies and not just stated one way or the other.

Really try and think of this objectively, as if you're not a human and you are studying humans as a species and noting their behaviour.  No one mentions even things that are fairly obvious.  Ok I'm about to drift away from parenting but I'm going to make a point that's rarely mentioned.

More woman seem accepting of gay male friends vs straight males accepting gay males as friends.  Why is this?  And why would any straight male care if another man is gay?  If anything, logically he should be thinking right on!  less competition!  But for some reason, that is not the case.

And another thing never mentioned but there has to be a reason for this.  Another time with a bunch of us and our girlfriends porn came up and some of the girls were complaining why is there always a lesbian scene.  Every man there liked lesbian porn, myself included.  Again, I should be threatened by that and as a result turned off (as she's potentially out of the dating pool)  but yet, the majority of men are aroused by this.  Conversely, we asked the girls if they wanted to see two men go at it in porn.  None of them did.  I was curious and said do you feel indifferent to it or is it a turn off.  Most of them said and I quote, 'it's gross'  And a lot of these girls have gays friends who they care for dearly, but yet the sexual act that is supposedly a beautiful thing, is being described as gross when two men are involved.  Why is this?

Right now in adoption, normally a married couple will get preference in adoption over a single adult.  And this is not simply because two heads are better than one.  It is because it is a complete family unit of what we are as a species (normally anyway)  And by me just saying normally, I feel somebody who is homosexual is going to say how dare I, implying they are not normal.  I don't mean it that way.  I mean typically, honestly I'm not sure what word to use.  Again, imagine you're an alien and you're studying these curious humans and you don't care about the results one way or another.

And the above is all talking in a perfect world, it ignores social ridicule.  Yes, a social evolution is going on (and it's a good thing) that will minimize this ridicule, but there will be some child who will be made fun of that he has two dad's.  Like cruel things, 'you dad sucks your other dad's cock!'  I could only imagine the effect such statements would have.

Minorities have always endured some level of social ridicule or feelings of alienation.  Lots of minorities growing up in the 70's wanted to look like the white kids.  This may still exist, but it's been minimized by the multicultural environment we live in.  A big part of this is continuing immigration.  But with homosexuals, you are always going to be the minority, forever.  And really, you have to be for the sake of our species.  We will probably never have an accurate stat of how many people are gay, but I suspect it's probably a static figure.  Let's say it's 5 %, even 10 %.  But if we discovered it was growing with each generation we would have to investigate what environmental factors are causing this.  Some say good, the population is too large anyway, and maybe that what homosexuality is, a built-in population check.

Ok probably going for the record for longest post, I mean no offence to anyone.  Think like you're completely disconnected from the issue and do not care about the outcome one way or another.

"gout","t5_2syer","As a sometimes gout sufferer, I feel your pain.  Gout sucks ass.  I have tried tart cherry juice, apple cider vinegar, alfalfa tablets, ibuprofen, mass quantities of water, prednisone, colchicine and probenecid.  I wish I had some great 'miracle cure' to turn you on to, but I have yet to find any gout miracles.  Until my most recent attack (in August), I was typically able to get relief within 24h if I took prednisone (5-day course).  However, my August attack was relentless...  No response to ibuprofen and, after a few days of severe pain, I tried the prednisone but no luck.

After 2 brutal, painful, sleepless weeks, it did get better.  I know it sucks, but it will get better -- keep telling yourself that.  Since that point in time, I have weaned myself onto probenecid (500 mg 1x/day) and colchicine (twice/day).  While I still has slight twinges indicating the onset of an attack, I have not had a relapse.

The attack was so bad that I have been living a 'saintly' lifestyle since...  No alcohol at all, almost a vegetarian (a very small amount of meat or fish about once a week), no cheating.  Got to say that given how bad the attack was, it has not been hard to give up alcohol or meat/fish/chicken.  It has the added advantage of making going out really cheap!

I know you said you don't have health insurance - that sucks.  At the point you do find yourself at the doc/clinic/ER for *anything*, be sure to bend the ear of the doc on your gout issue and see if you can get a script/Rx for a short course (5-day) for prednisone to have on hand.  You don't have to fill the prescription right away --- and it's a really cheap drug, if/when you do fill the prescription.  Getting a script/Rx for probenecid or allipurinol is more involved, as you'll likely have the cost of a lab for the doc to get baseline data on your uric acid.   The drugs (probenecid and allipurinol) are not expensive, but they do require Rx.

Lastly, colchicine is OFF THE CHARTS expensive.  If you really want to get pissed off about the abuses of the US-medical system, read this article and watch the embedded video: http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/10/10/eveningnews/main20118283.shtml

I think that many of us here completely abstain from alcohol because we cannot stop at one- we are alcoholics. We get to that realization through trial and error, but ultimately we realize that we cannot have a relationship with alcohol that isn't abusive. I know this subreddit is also set up to help people cut down on their drinking. That is great, but I personally have had no experience in controlled drinking, so I am not sure if alcoholics like me can give you pointers. We do have a lot of advice on how to avoid drinking completely however. 

Do you think you are an alcoholic? There is a test on the sidebar that can help you determine that. What do you think causes you to binge? Where does this happen and in what settings? Try writing down the scenarios that you can remember where you drank too much. (hard to do, I know) If you can find what pushes you too far, like peer pressure, social anxiety, etc, it might be easier to prevent over drinking in the future.

Plus wagon for lots of cargo space, lots of features in the GT like cruise, electric everything, sunroof, often leather interior. You should be able to find one for $6000 or so, with low enough miles. 

These Legacys (3rd generation) are very well built, quality interiors, and rarely have significant problems. However, now that they are getting to 10+ years old, there is a chance the headgaskets may need replacing, so get it fully checked out by a mechanic especially if there are any signs that the previous owner didnt take good care of the car's maintenance

"Israel","t5_2qhvo","&gt;You said that the Palestinians where not unique, so to evaluate whether how accurate that is, I would have thought that identifying identical or similar groups would be very relevant.

Unless you can name another group in which refugee status is transferred from generation to generation, you're simply going on irrelevant tangents here. It's not that Palestinians in particular can't have their children classed as refugees, it's that ANYONE who is not a citizen of a country or did not reside there cannot be classed as a refugee.

You're trying to make it seem as though the Palestinians are being specifically chosen and isolated but that's not the case at all. They simply don't meet the definition. If you're asking for other groups who don't meet the UNHCR definition of what constitutes a refugee, you have nearly 7 billion people to choose from.

&gt;They aren't citizens though.

That has nothing to do with Israel or the UNHCR though. That's related to the specific countries. Also, I'm sure there are many Palestinians in Western countries like the U.S. and Canada who have acquired citizenship.

As far as those in Jordan, Syria, and Lebanon, that's actually a big issue. These countries often refuse to provide citizenship to Palestinians even after they've lived there for decades. That's an issue that the pro-Palestinian crowd should be very vocal about, as it's a genuine case of Palestinians being robbed of rights they should be receiving. This significant issue doesn't get the notice it deserves because the pro-Palestinian crowd focuses all its efforts on Gaza and the West Bank and ignores all other Palestinians in the region.","1322699717"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Ah, there's the thing - good characters are difficult to create, an awesome story with high-quality depth is also rather difficult. Having sexualised female characters is *not* a requirement, in fact it is a crutch and a hindrance *at times*, but it is nonetheless an element. It's a cliché of sorts, that sometimes fits the tale - what would a classical film noir-tale be without the femme fatale in a red dress, for instance?

The gist of it is, we're having two points of discussion at once: ""good vs bad"" character design, and ""sexualised vs non-sexualised"". Good design is, well, good; sexualised can be either good or bad, depending on the other point.

To discuss how much of the above was Devil's advocate, I am personally quite fond of a *well-executed* ""sexy character"", just as much as I am fond of a well-executed Byronic Hero one. I too get a bit bored with chainmail bikinis and bland personas, unless it's intentionally playing with the trope. At the end of the day, there's that reptile-brain part of me that actually likes that sort of thing, and as long as my primate-brain does not protest an excess (e.g. via it being just plain poorly-executed design), I'm quite okay with the whole jig.

My essence here is, people often do blanket statements about sexualisation, and tend to include the ""good"" executions thereof (see: the film Sucker Punch, for instance) with the ""bad"".

As for your last statement about (pseudo)majority vs all-round, a common argument is when a game, franchise or genre is trying to spread itself too thin, to appeal to a wider audience - it ends up alienating the original fans of the series, though it may catch the attention of previous non-fans.

'The industry as a whole is wide enough to include something for each and everyone, and I'm getting tired of people condemning games or genres for their ""exclusivity"" via means of e.g. their portrayal of women, when there are myriad examples of ones that don't do this.","1322699719"

I believe that nothing is more of a hindrance than The WWII Generation and their post-war construct of the ideal human existence. Particularly the politics, morals and cultural fear-mongering that was established within that time period is still affecting us today, and while things are moving rapidly in the world the mode of thinking clings to the past - and it's a past that didn't have many of the the social, economic or technological inventions and challenges that we have today.

I'm not saying that the ""ways"" of that time didn't have value at a certain time, or for a period of time afterwards, but I get the impression that this weighs us (as people in general) more than we care to admit.","1322699719"

As for the issue the liver enzymes, many things can cause an increase in them.  I do not have liver disease, but I am diabetic and that is causing elevated enzymes. 


Also, if you doctor isn't responding to your questions look at him/her and say that.  Doctors often don't realize that they spend far to less time with their patients answering their questions.

"canada","t5_2qh68","The paragraph infers that authorities would be able to monitor your internet traffic without warrant or cause.

This is false and quite misleading. 

In order to view your internet traffic, under the proposed bills authorities would require either 

A) A warrant

B) a production order 

A production order is a different form of warrant, it is issued by a judge similar to a Warrant. The parimary difference being a production order requires the ISP to produce information, whereas a warrant allows the authorities to search for the information they are looking for. I am sure you can appreciate why, when dealing with large amounts of data, it makes more sense to issue a production order rather then a warrant. 

So while it is technically correct to say that authorities could view your data without a warrant, they would in fact require a production order. 

Again all of this was spelled out in the proposed bills. However somewhere a long the line opinion articles and websites such as Steve's started to spin and distort the reality - once that starts happening, misinformation just starts growing like a snowball, with websites and opinion articles linking each other as ""sources"", while no one bothers to actually refer, link to, or even look at the proposed bills. 

edit: To expand further, production order's can only be issued to view historical data (IE, data in the ISP's hands). To view real-time data (aka surveillance) a warrant would be required. 

edit#2: I am not necessarily ""for"" or ""against"" this bill - what I am against are websites fear mongering and promoting misinformation. I believe in a certain ethical standard, and that when providing information to a large number of readers/viewers you should always start with the unedited facts and then go from there.

It was tenth grade and two Friends and I had been plotting to do it for a while, so I asked another fried who went to a different school and he got me an 8th for 55. I had no idea how much I was getting so I just went along with it. So the day approached and me and my two buddies went to one of their apartments. We constructed a water bottle bong, using a bottle, a pen and tin foil. So we packed the tiny bowl and tried lighting it. At first I though we were suppose to light the bowl underneath the bud but one of my friends corrected me. We kept trying to get hits for the next half an hour but it wasn't working. So eventually we learned what to actually do and I got a monster rip. I held it in for as long as possible before I coughed all over the place. My chest an throat was burning so i lied on the ground saying ""my chest is on fire"". Next one of my friends went and he got a huge rip ad did the same thing as me. My friend said something and I just started laughing, it wasn't even even funny but I kept laughing and I couldn't stop. So then it was my turn to pack the bowl and as I picked up the water bottle I blinked for a second and next thing I knew my friends were screaming at me to stop, cause I tilted the bottle and water was pouring out of the downstem. It felt like what I was seeing was 2 seconds behind what I was feeling. I tried to describe this feeling to my friends but they had no idea what I was saying. My legs were vibrating but it felt good and then later on I knocked over a whole box of chex mix cause I didn't see it. Me and one other felt it, one did not. Overall, great time","1322699745"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;I think you're interpreting Wittgenstein as a logical positivist, which isn't quite justified. Logical positivists in his day made the same mistake, and frequently invited him to their meetings. Supposedly, he showed up once and with his back towards the crowd he began reciting poetry. The early Wittgenstein may have delimited the field of meaningful utterances to the empirical world, to that 'which is the case'. But, the most important field, for him, was that was beyond the limitation. Such as poetry, religion and metaphysics. Wittgenstein by no means wanted to bury metaphysics.

No, I am not interpreting Wittgenstein as a logical positivist, and I do not see where you have that from as nothing I have said should be conducive to making you believe so. Wittgenstein was an ""anti-philosopher"", and this is pretty clearly agreed upon by those who follow him (and those who do not).

In both of his major works he concludes that philosophy has no rightful thing to do but to dissolve itself. He reinvented the term ""philosophy"" to mean loosening knots that the philosophy up until his time (and sadly, after) had tied in their misuse of language and distorted picture of language disconnected from its actual use.

Also, you shouldn't group poetry in with religion and metaphysics. Poetry is art, it has nothing to do with the other two and no Wittgensteinian would have 'problems' with it.","1322699745"

I would argue that because temperament is generally agreed to be a function of genetics, a person's susceptibility to be persuaded by an emotional argument is governed by genetics and is not learned. Not that education has nothing to do with it, but i would say that someones innate perception of the world has more to do with it. after all, we were all exposed to the same educational system. 

The reason i say it's willful stupidity is that you and I probably know some perfectly intelligent people, who are pro choice. When you lay out the argument that from a simple risk assessment standpoint, it's clearly more risky to be accidentally killing people than it is to accidentally be birthing them. therefore burden of proof must be on the prochoicers, they'll bring up the fact that ""well people are raped."" This is not necessarily ignorant, or regurgitated argument... it's simply illogical, and coming from people who I KNOW can think critically, it seems to me to be stupid.

&gt;given the right context, they may be willing to adopt more sound and ethical reasoning.

If Obama's speech segments about ""billy bob losing his job"" didn't, at a psychological level, work on the majority of people, he would not bother to put it in his speeches.

Here's a python script I threw together. You need python to run it(3.2 i think). The script is configurable to different heights and width by setting a and b at the beginning.

The default output is 250 x 400 = 100,000 tiles, so even at the somewhat ridiculous speed of 1 tile per second, you'll need 28 hours to finish. Tiles one and three are the ones you have two of, tiles 5-10 are any other of the six others.

code is here: see edit

Also feel free to comment as I am still very much a novice programmer.

It would be nice if someone could add a function at the end to give a total tile count for each tile as well. I'm not sure how to do that.

It feels good to know they're living a good life and not a judgmental bitter one like their neighbors. 

Gays are cool and they shouldn't be under such discrimination. People say we all have equal rights, well, we don't.

"timetravel","t5_2qhjv","I have a few concerns with this: 

1) You start by assuming that people have free will. That's not at all a given. Even if it's intuitive to some people, it's not agreed upon universally.

2) We can frequently predict each other's actions; I don't see why that's more of an (apparent) argument against free will when time traveling is involved. The certainty of the prediction when using time travel is greater than most of the time, but there are plenty of times, without time travel, when we can predict people's behaviour with 100% accuracy. 

3) I think the key in the can't-physically-kill-your-grandfather is not that you *can't*, it's that you *didn't*. In this model, you physically *could* kill your grandfather, but then you wouldn't exist in the first place, so it's more accurate to just say that you *didn't* kill your grandfather in the past, which means that you won't in your personal future (the past). What circumstance arises that prevents you from doing it? Not something contrived or a deus ex machina; just something that necessarily already happened.

Personally I a) don't think we have free will and b) don't think this model of time travel is accurate, so this doesn't really apply to my thinking anyway :p . I think if you think of time as a 4th dimension instead of something magical, it's intuitive to me that doing something in the past won't somehow travel forth and back through time to affect your time-traveling self. When you change your past, a new future is created off away in the 4th dimension, but you're already there in the past anyway, insulated from any changes to the future. Magical time waves are not gonna come back from your deleted future and smack you in the face. That's my theory :)

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","For my high school band's initiation, we like to ""kidnap"" the freshmen and new members (if they went to a different high school before ours, they were included in the kidnapping). The parents knew ahead of time; the band director explained what was going to happen as the band's leadership took the freshmen and new members out for ice-breaking activities.

The kidnap happens after the first week of band camp which is designated just for the frosh and new members. So, usually on that Saturday.

Well, it just so happens that Comic-Con ended about two or three weeks before this event and I had a pretty good ninja costume that I loved. I decided to wear this for the kidnapping instead of the older band uniforms that the rest of leadership wore.

We drove up to our freshmen's houses in one of the parent's mini vans, one of the hipsters in a tight fitting old guard outfit and another member in a ratty, torn up jacket and me, behind a mask. We rang on the doorbell and gathered to first person, a guy. He was only in boxers, so we exited his room and he got to get dressed before we whisked him away in our minivan.

We then proceeded to the girl's house. She lived on a square street (where the entrance and exit is onto the same street) and we pulled up to her door. As we entered, her father answered the door holding a camera. We walk to her room on the other side of the house and open her door. She freaks out silently, confused and in panic. She can only grab money, shoes and a small jacket, and we shove her into the minivan as well.

For the rest of the ride to IHOP, she thinks she's dreaming. All the way through breakfast, she thinks she's dreaming. But once we start driving home, she accepts what happened to be real and we just can't stop looking at each other, smiling and telling jokes.

On the first day of school, I ask her out.

thats right.. i thought so too, you are either going to tell me to ask them to be friendly (and get a response of ""stfu noob useless"" + tribunal ban) or tell me to ignore them..  or say that im being negative and that i'll surely find players that listen to my friendly advice or warnings.. but this just doesn't happen in this game most of the time.. at least anymore.

1 in 10 games are good. and by good i mean those that have some teamwork in them.. and no insulting/swearing/shouting at each other without reason.

this is exactly what happens to me in either normal or ranked games: http://www.own3d.tv/Grackis#/watch/309100 (not my video)

I haven't started the legion/stormcloaks questline either, mainly cause I have been waiting for a choice of screwing with both of them.

So your argument, in other words, is that I will be looking out for my own well-being if I act as god commanded me to. I just feel that as long as we're discussing the roots of morality, we should be clear as to what they are. 

My counterargument to what you've provided so far is this: I believe you cannot find an intelligent basis for morality that does not rest upon that of the protection of human well-being. Thus, well-being is the only rational basis to construct morality from.

Even the religious argument for objective ethics has been shown to be merely self-preservation for the sake of the next life. (It's funny how my argument is mirroring that of Sam Harris. It's almost like I have his book next to me or something :)","1322699769"

"programming","t5_2fwo","In Haskell98, one of the most clearly useful extensions is multiparameter type classes (which are part of Haskell2010.)

Another very useful one is BangPatterns - they can be replaced by usages of `seq`, but are otherwise also a syntactic convenience. I do not think these are part of Haskell2010, but I may be wrong.

Existential quantification is also rather useful many times. It is part of Haskell2010, but not H98.

There are various `deriving` extensions that can automatically derive a bunch of useful typeclasses like Data/Typeable, Monad, Functor, Foldable, and Traversable. There is also GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving as kamatsu said above. None of these are essential and can be replaced with hand written instances (although personally I think hand-written Typeable instances should probably be banned - typeable also isn't part of a standard, anyway.)

Type families/Functional dependencies are not part of any standard, but very useful, especially for nicely parametric interfaces and the like. Personally I think TFs are considerably easier to grok than FDs and much more functional in nature.

There are various record extensions that aren't essential, but making the use of records considerably simpler and more palatable: Named field puns and record wild cards, for example. They are not part of any standard, but they are not considerably complex either.

Undecidable instances are not part of any standard but are occasionally fairly useful. They can't readily be replicated, at least not to my knowledge. They will not cause the type checker to not-terminate however, as GHC has a recursion limit.

Most type class extensions aren't terribly complicated, but make type class instances/declarations much more flexible. These include flexible contexts, among other things - which isn't really that complicated, it's an extension that says in a constraint, you can have more than *just* type variables - you can actually mention a type in the context of a type class constraint (like `[]` for example, as opposed to a type variable like `a`.) 

Scoped type variables are quite useful. You can get by without them sometimes, but they do make certain things considerably nicer to express. They are not very complicated to reason about.

Constraint kinds will likely end up being very useful. They are not standard, and cannot easily be replicated, but their intent is not too complex: they merely allow you to abstract and quantify over the constraint language, the same way you can already abstract and quantify over types and type variables.

Polymorphic kinds will likely end up being useful. They are not standard, and cannot be easily replicated by any means (short of mass TH hackery or something I guess.)

Without a doubt, there are 2 extensions which come to mind off hand that are very useful sometimes, but also somewhat complex in nature, and not part of any standard:

 * Generalized algebraic data types (GADTs.) Many uses can be replaced with (H2010 standardized) empty data types and phantom type idioms, but their *real* use is for effectively representing equality witnesses between types. This use case cannot be replaced by phantom types, or anything of the sort. You need GADTs.
 * RankNTypes, which allow arbitrary rank polymorphism, i.e. a `forall` can occur in places other than the outermost scope of a type signature. It's the difference between saying `f :: forall a. (a -&gt; a) -&gt; Int` and sayiing `f :: (forall a. a -&gt; a) -&gt; Int` - note the quantification is *not* scoped over the *entire* signature, but instead only scoped over the first argument (which is a polymorphic function.)

The compiler will generally tell you when these extensions (among others) are needed. I very rarely find myself using extensions that are impossible to replace - most of them, like deriving mechanisms, record extensions, bang patterns, overloaded strings, and view patterns are largely a means of syntactic convenience. It's quite easy to avoid almost all of the 'un-replicatable' extensions, in my experience.","1322699771"

You can keep living in delusion and telling yourself this isn't the case, maybe in a perfect world it wouldn't be - but we don't live in a perfect world. In the real world (not the internet) sometimes you have to make the best of a bad situation.

Maybe parenthood isn't a joy, maybe there is no tangible return in raising a child (though in my opinion that is an incredibly selfish way to look at it). I have several friends that are fathers, a couple of who did not plan on being them. I don't know any of them who can say with 100% conviction that they regret being a part of their life.

It is my humble suggestion than since there is going to be another living, breathing human being (that he assisted in creating when he shot his unprotected load into his GF). That maybe, perhaps at some point, it should (sorry I know that since it makes an ambiguous moral implication that you hate that word) stop being about HIM and become about the child as well.

Or you know, you could always leave the kid in the hands of the psychopathic mother, which I guess would be what you think is best.

If I was in his situation and knocked up some psycho, it would be a cold day in hell before I left a child that is a part me in the clutches of someone demonic enough to do that to another person.

It's obvious neither of us is going to change the others mind. Different people handle situations in different ways. I'm confident that if I was ever put in a situation like this, that I would be able to handle it in a way that would allow me and the child to sleep well at night regardless of how fair or unfair it is to myself.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","This is very biased and not completely true. Sure it may cost 1.8 cents to make a penny, but that's assuming  that once you use it, the penny disappears. Since a penny can last a long time in circulation, its value gradually increases since they don't have to keep replacing the penny. So let's say a penny costs the 1.8 cents to make, but goes through circulation for about 20 years before it gets tossed in to a river and never seen again. That one single penny may have cost 1.8 cents, but may have been circulated hundreds of times, meaning it didn't have to be replaced and therefore eventually saved money. Also, calling people who use exact change inconsiderate jerks wasting other people's times makes you lose credibility, blowing such a small thing out of proportion. If someone is intending to use change, they more than likely have a collection of coins ready so that once they hear their cost, can quick pull out whatever coins necessary to complete their transaction. If you think about it, the amount of time it takes for someone to pull out exact change is probably even less than it would take to have the cashier pull out the bills and then count the change to give back to you.

"PHP","t5_2qh38","If you (like me) are concerned about marrying your company to a framework that will continue to be actively maintained indefinitely, I think there's really only one sensible choice in the PHP market, and that's Zend Framework.

I am not sure what you specifically use as criteria to determine what makes a framework 'micro', but ZF is very much a glue framework, meaning you can pick and choose from the dozens of components it includes and use only those you require/desire. It also allows you to inject your own (or third party) components into the mix and do anything you need. It's very actively maintained by a professional crew and is probably the best bet for PHP framework longevity.

There are other well established and well maintained frameworks out there, like Cake, etc, but having used that one at least, I'd sooner use Zend going forward. Also, I find getting forced into a lot of the conventions of all-in-one frameworks sometimes annoying. Cake's models are crap, that is all.","1322699782"

Because there is a 1.48:1 ARP:AD ratio this means that unless you exceed 1:1 AD ratios ARP is superior at 68 AD and above. Therefor the optimal setup is (68 - base AD)Bonus AD, then ARP. This means for level 1 fighting for most carries full flat AD should be best, but every time you level the setup will get worse. With abilities it's more complicated because ARP affects total damage, while AD only affects bonus damage. So Caitlyn's Q at rank 1 normalizes at 61 AD. So at 61 or more AD her Q benefits more from ARP than from AD.","1322699783"

Pros: You get to stay at home.  

Cons: You lose your boyfriend.

People who see their lover as the only positive when moving to a country WILL be miserable. There are no ""ifs"" or ""buts"" here. I've seen people in your situation before and it's not pretty.
  
My advice to you:  

A.) Break up with him    

B.) Try a long-distance relationship. Who knows? Maybe he doesn't end up liking life in Sweden/Norway. Grass is always greener... And if he decides to stay you can split ways then.  
  
If you feel strongly for this guy I would go with option B for sure. You're still young and have time to take a break to figure out what you both want. Best of luck!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Moving my other replies away from the use and definition of terms onto the philosophy of Anarchy itself.

The problem with an anarchist political philosophy is that it requires everyone to respect and support each other.  The best example given is in the hunter gatherer structure.  However, what most miss in those cultures I think is the regard of ""head man"" and ""elder"" guidance of the group.  Hunter Gatherer clans being quite small societies means that an even more overt built in mutual reliance exists.  There still is, however, a hierarchical structure that can, and has been, enforced by violence (bet it physical or the violence of exile/ostracism.  

This political philosophy is mutually exclusive with an atheistic point of view.

What do I support?  I'm more a *freedomist*.  That means that people own themselves.  They can do what they want with their bodies and their properties.  The State protects these freedoms and only intervenes when they are causing harm to another.  We don't have that today.

The reason why in that model the state is needed is that human nature still creates a percentage that will prey on others.  We can quite easily view what occurs in Africa when there is no central authority that will protect people.  Those are the best definition of anarchy -- no state, no government, no support, so groups create their own.  Warlords exert their authority and the innocent people suffer.

I don't know how the scoring systems work now, but back in 2001, that was about average. When I applied to various schools, only Yale asked me for my scores. They were aware of my situation however, so I doubt they were an issue. Columbia asked me to retake my SATs. I declined. I had a 2.8 GPA in HS and flunked out of two colleges prior to my military service. As for my community college success, I had a 4.0 and was President of the Honor's Club as well as the Honor's College convocation speaker, so I had that going for me. 

My biggest asset was my life story, not just my military service. The fact that I was a former struggling student who failed out of not one... but two colleges and turned my life around was pretty appealing. My military service and deployments to Iraq certainly helped, but my overall story of how I overcame my childish ways, grew into a responsible adult and succeeded is what tipped the scales.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Her, myself and a few other people were staying at a house that had a pond for a little get-together. We were all up late but there was no drinking or anything like that. The father hadnt been in picture since the girl was born. Kids were sleeping with the mother in a spare room at the house and I was asleep on one of the couches. She woke me up saying that the kids werent in bed with her and asked if I had seen them. Looked around and noticed one of the doors open (that I personally had locked and bolt latched before going to bed) so we went outside to see if they had randomly wandered outside. She and a couple of the other adults were checking around the garage and front yard (it was a huge property) and me and another were checking around back to see if they had gone near the apple trees or pond. We both saw them at roughly the same time floating in the water and dove in. They were already clammy and blueish. Somehow they had both just managed to get out of bed without waking their mom and unbolted the door to get outside. The cops ended up questioning her at first thinking it was suspicous circumstances but there was no signs of bruising or other foul play in the examination. In the few years prior to that nothing I had known about the mom would make me think she could ever do anything to hurt her own children but its the worse experience that has ever happened in my life and I cant help but have doubts about everything. I keep thinking I had to have messed something up during the CPR before the medics arrived. And I cant help but wonder if the mom did have something to do with it. The fact they fell in at the same time isnt weird to me as the two were inseperable, but sometimes its hard to wonder how they managed to get out of bed, downstairs, and get the locks undone.","1322699801"

"Boxing","t5_2qj0l","I think it's good to start light, especially if you're new so that you get comfortable moving and stuff.  You can go harder once you get more settled and it will probably just happen naturally as you get more familiar with your sparring partners.  You'll probably end up starting out kind of light end with the intensity increasing with each round.  

However, I would not recommend going to light, or slow, because that won't really help you because that's not how you'll be fighting.  Save that stuff for drills.  You should be going hard enough that you don't want to be getting hit, especially in the body.  Since you're new, you should be moving with people who can stay under control so that you can work on what you need to work on and if you accidentally let a punch go too hard, they are cool enough not to feel like they have to try to knock you out, thought they'll probably turn it up a bit.  

Also, any out-of-gym sparring should be 100% and really just treated like a fight unless otherwise specified. 

Definitely don't spazz out because boxing you want to be moving and throwing your punches correctly but also remember, you are training for fighting, so it's not all technique, you can't be perfectly technical all the time, sometimes you just have to brawl a little.  ","1322699806"

I should mention that I agree with you, that zabiha and shechita (the jewish version of the ritual slaughter, also involving exsanguination) is needlessly cruel. But the term halal isn't applicable.

For all of our local tertiary care hospitals, it's not unusual to have acute patients flown in from rural centers 1000+ miles away - that includes level one traumas.

That you seem to some degree feel a sense of satisfaction and amusement when you observe others making conjectures or voicing rumors about where it came from, and liken this behavior to the actions of children. Not that it doesn't make sense that you get a feeling of satisfaction from being in-the-know and are interested in and amused by hearing the rumors and conjectures that crop up about it. But it does become a bit uncomfortable to get the sense that what you're feeling is akin to watching children on ""Kids say the darnedest things"". That comparison, while funny and clever, brings to mind the image of you sitting there thinking that those who are not in the know are naive and adorable in their misconceptions, which is belittling.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Short answer: Not so fast!!! I'm a post doc here at Harvard (your friendly neighbor!) there's a couple of important distinctions to make. Have you ever been challenged by your lab or been given a lot of responsibility to challenge your intellect at work? Sometimes that can make all the difference in how you perceive and pursue your talents. 

I also love cooking, but I find that having an activity like that is better as a hobby because I'm similarly proficient at hard sciences like you must be. Although it doesn't feel like it, it's extremely early for you to be scrutinizing your life goals as imminent decisions. 

I have simply found that exploiting a hobby you love as a career can dilute the enjoyment. Explore your talents in science more before you make that decision. Explore other mentors that can challenge and give you freedom as a researcher; you may be surprised when you find success and enjoyment there and cooking becomes a true luxury that you spoil yourself with.","1322699819"

With most magma seas there are sections with quite a bit of 'airspace' above the magma.  So all you have to do is utilize some creative engineering.  Just channel down some water and create a multilayer obsidian floor.  You can then channel out a few stones here and there.

This is completely foolproof and highly efficient.

Avoid alcohol (as its a depressant).

But if you have to have alcohol, try ordering vodka and Redbull.  Watch how they make it though, because vodka can be cheaper than Redbull so bar tenders may go heaving on the vodka and only splash the energy in there.

My most reliable solution is 5 hour energy shots.  It puts me exactly where I need to be and it is pretty predictable as to when it wears off.  So if I time it right, I will be sleepy by the time I crawl into bed.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","And then money became the plaything of governments and the target of derivatives markets, and people learned that this store of human value or commodity value is designed to melt in their hands.  So money itself isn't even valued evenly by everybody and you only have to look up or down at different scales of money to see people and entities transacting with the same ""money"" in a completely different value system.  So money has already become a fiction.  Its a shared fiction and its what we use right now, but its deeply flawed.

We have trillions of dollars of actual value on the planet and quadrillions of derivatives based on that.  And yet we feel the need to pay the Sheriff to throw a 100 year old woman out on the street because of a few thousand dollars discrepancy.  This is how flawed and venal the current allocation of ""human value"" is.  Maybe it would more financial sense just to go in and shoot her.

There are many experiments in valuing and transacting services and objects in terms of points, credits, synthetic currencies that are fixed to commodities.  We will soon see advanced bartering systems.  There are systems to trade man hours with other people online.  Advanced cooperative systems.  

Why aren't indices of societal benefit or carbon usage used in business planning ?  The only thing they put into the machine is money.  The only thing a corporation does is chase the money.  It gnaws its own foot off (the workers) just to save some more money and then wonders why it seems to be stumbling.

Don't you ever watch Star Trek ? Wizard of Oz ?  They've moved past money.

People will not ever value everything the same, in fact they aren't supposed to. That's the whole basis of market economies : arbitrage and seizing a good opportunity and then selling it a profit.","1322699846"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A manga forum. Twice. No wait; make that 3. You'd think I'd learn. 

Met the current boyfriend in a rock-climbing class while still going out with bachelor #3 of the manga forum. The instructor paired us up so we had no choice but to chatter through the semester. It was an absolutely plutonic friendship. Then, a year or so later, a little after I had broken up with the manga boyfriend, I was up late at night browsing through Facebook for a lack of a better thing to do, when Mr. Rock-Climber messaged me asking me what the hell I was doing still being up. So we got to talking. I told him men suck and he asked if I'd wanna go grab food with him sometime. Mind you, naive me had no idea he meant that as a date-like occasion. I just though ""food."" 

So come Wednesday, or Tuesday, or whatever day the date was, and he drives to my place to pick me up. He takes me out to a revolving sushi bar, which by the way gentlemen of Reddit, is a *brilliant* place to take a lady friend. You won't regret it. We eat food, talk, and then he makes some very lame excuse as to why he should pay for my food. I am still clueless that this is how a typical date works. 

After this day, we make it a habit to hang out at least once a week. It helps that it's winter break, so we have time away from school. Along comes Christmas, and he tells me a friend of his is having a big Christmas dinner at his place, and that I should go with him. Turns out by ""big,"" the friend just meant it was going to be his family. So there we are, Guy Friend, his friend, the family, and I. You'd think it was awkward, but I didn't realize everyone besides us was related until after. 

So one innocent day I'm over at his place, two of us sitting on his bed, and we're doing a Dexter marathon. You know with all the blood and gore. As an episode comes to an end, he reaches over, tilts my chin up a little with a gentle hand gesture, and kisses me. Talk about romantic. This is the point where I start freaking out internally; what is this?! Friends don't do this. But he didn't ask me out. Would he even want to date me? AH!! You know, the typical girl over-thinking crap. 

Come January (by that I just mean like a week after the kiss incident), and Guy Friend asks if I'd want to tag along for a short vacation to Vegas with him and some friends. We've talked about this trip in passing a while back, and I didn't know he was actually serious. But I said yes, because, well Vegas. So the day of, he shows up at my door. Him and a single friend. Single guy friend, mind you. Turns out the rest of the gang dropped out. Well that's all still cool. We were going to get two rooms anyway, I could just take one room, and the two guys the other. Guy Friend had other sneaky plans, though. 

Turns out, both rooms just had one king-size bed, and the two guys were not okay with sharing one. So Guy Friend booked the one friend in one room, and the two of us in the other. Oh boy. 

We roam the streets and clubs during the afternoon. Then come night time, and it's time to go to bed. Now I start realizing what exactly is going on; we start fooling around, rolling around in bed, but being the bitch of a person I am, I don't put out. Well aslo it was that time of the month. That was actually the only reason. Cause well he's very cute. 

But still I don't exactly know what status that puts us in. So I finally man up and ask, ""what are we?"" To which he responds. ""Well, do you want to be my girlfriend?"" And I say yes. 

And ladies and gentlemen, that is the story of how my boyfriend went to Vegas and brought back a girlfriend. I still tease him to this day that that's now what you do in Vegas. 

Also we're going back for our one-year-anniversary in a month. 

Also he's a redditor too. But he said I could take the karma in exchange for a blowjob. ","1322699847"

Most of them already have to file detailed balance sheets in order to meet SEC and satisfy investors, so it ought to be easier to do it this way, rather than burden every single individual in the entire country with income tax laws, and crazy schemes such as taxing individuals and then giving them a tax rebate if their income falls below a certain level. You could take a portion of that corporate tax money and then issue a negative flat tax for all individuals, whereby everyone gets a fixed amount of money from the government, and get to keep all of any income they earn as well, and this scheme would replace welfare. It would be FAR less overhead, and far simpler for the average consumer. Everyone wins, the companies would get a win in terms of smaller government and fewer regulations, and the individual would have access to a larger welfare pay check due to less of it being siphoned off and wasted along the way.","1322699849"

"neuro","t5_2qu9b","Being ""screwed"" depends on what you want to do with your life.  If you just want to do research, you probably aren't screwed, you can make a pretty damn good living as a technician or working for a pharma company.  If you want to get out of research entirely and go be a technical writer, a patent examiner or patent agent, a teacher of high school level students, etc., you probably aren't screwed.

But if you want to be able to do *your own* research, present it, have control over what problems you're working on... you need the PhD.  If you want to teach undergraduates, you need the Ph.D.  If you want to work in public service, the Ph.D. would be a huge asset.

If it helps any, I spent 6 years getting my Ph.D. and had a rough time of it.  I had a rough time of it, but a lot of the people in my cohort didn't make it through the program.  Several of them I still see every day -- they work in other departments of the university as lab managers or people in charge of various of our core facilities.  I keep track of a lot of the others over Facebook -- they're all doing fine.  None of them have gone back to try to get the PhD again, and I don't think any of them want to -- they seem happy where they are.

So don't panic.  It sounds to me like this is a done deal, like you've already turned in all the forms and everyone knows your intentions and whatnot.  But if it isn't a done deal, I would make sure that you are 100% OK with leaving your degree.  I know that the last 3 years of my Ph.D. were undiluted agony.  My project sucked, my committee sort of sucked, I hated my life and thought about jumping off a bridge every day, and my marriage got ruined.  So yeah, I basically knowingly completely destroyed my life for a few years.  Maybe I drank the Kool-Aid or something, but I don't regret any of it.  I love being a post-doc, I love the stuff I'm working on (I have my own project and total control over it), and I can't think of any other career that I would find remotely tolerable (except for being an international sex symbol, and I'm not that hot).","1322699852"

You have to admit, the idea that our brains are not just biochemical computers, but also quantum computers, particularly if such a suggestion does not disagree with experiment, is pretty awesome. :)

I'm not willing to give up on the idea of consciousness and free will; sure, we see that it isn't necessarily borne out by what we know about the brain, but again, we still have a lot of questions about the brain.  And we *appear* to be able to think, and reason, and make decisions.  Claiming that consciousness is an illusion is uncompelling.

Marriage equality would mean that people who happened to be gay had the same rights as everyone else. Ie. It was called the same thing (marriage) and there wasn't a special distinction in law between marriage and gay marriage as currently exists. Civil union may give various legal rights, but there is still a distinction there in law saying certain grown adults can't get married.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","I don't know how your game went down. But usually not EVERY lane is warded REALLY correctly.
Usually players ward one bush and leave the other.

If top/bot lane's riverside bush is warded, come in from the tri bush above it and gank from behind him (if you're blue team) or move undetected into the brush and gank him from there (if you're purple team)

If they don't ward the bush but rather the wall of dragon/baron then come in the REALLY long way, which is the entrance to the wraiths.
Mid has 4 separate entrances which I will hardly doubt have 0 accessibility.

Even with wards, and if your laners are retarded, just tell them to get pushed. I usually ask my laner to intiate and wait a couple of seconds thus forcing the WHOLE fight and little chance of running away and I can gank successfully.

The leaching exp part isn't as hard as you would think, most of the time after a gank on mid/top the laner might go back. If so then push his wave into the tower.
By the time he'd be back the enemy tower would have reverse pushed the lane back into the centre.
Some Mid laners roam and gank after getting their level 6/11/13 advantage. Cover for their lane and get that exp. As little as you can find, it's not a problem because it's much more helpful than the jungle.","1322699865"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","The French New Wave was a Movement in the late 50's that basically birthed theories of auteurship in film. It is the driving force of a lot of film really (even tho you can completely disregard it as bull shit). There are many views and opinions of this theory as everyone is as right as the other. But genrally an auteur puts a signature in their work. If you do a little reading on auteur theory you will understand it more, it is completely convoluted and paradoxical, but it can also be seen as brilliant and engaging.

The Directors of film you are probably familiar with that are considered auteurs, Scorsese, Tarantino. As you can see a style with their work.


If you want to look at some of the first films that made are important in film studies, Breathless, The 400 Blows, A woman is a woman. these are in french so you will need subs. They are great, some of my favorite films. these are by Goddard and Truffaut. (they may be hard going to start with as you like me when i started grew up watching modern film that is very different) but this is where it began. 


A good way to go about giving things meaning in film is to think about,

Form + Content = Meaning

From, is the way you use the camera etc. And. Content is the Mise en Scene.

e.g. if you have a man in a field and the camera is pulled out to give a wide shot where he is very small in the middle, your conveying loneliness by combining the Form(camera position) Content (man in field)

I didn't want to insult your film as it was good, but it looked like you wanted to use to many things for cuts because they were new sort of thing.

So i guess I misspoke when I said allergy as an autoimmune because technically they are very different.

Just because you don't care for religion (seemingly) doesn't mean throwing every single one into a category of 'cult' makes any logical sense.

I think it's fair to tell him that you were hurt by the breakup and that you want greater assurances of his commitment before you go back to where you were before. If he doesn't get that, it will certainly suck - but you will have learned something VERY important.

(there use to be a time when long hair was popular, so people sick of it, chose to go short, but now everyone is short, so I think eventually people will get sick of it, and go long). Something like that, but it's a bit opposite for girls.

As for scientific reasoning... Well, since male baldness is a big problem for most guys, I think that explains why men find long hair more attractive on women. (as well as their incapability to take care of their own long hair, so they cut it short for ease).","1322699885"

&gt; The Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these religions. She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men.

This is a bullshit line that the Catholic Church feeds to the public.  Centuries of persecution of ""heretics"", institutionalized rape of children, and a list of atrocities that goes on for quite a while proves it -- published apologies mean nothing when the acts are unchanged.

In a nutshell, you normally pay the higher of the two tax rates (your current country's and the USA's). 

That is, if you're in a country with 40% tax rate and the USA's is 30%, then at the end of the day you end up paying 40%.

Likewise if you're in a country with a 20% tax rate and the USA's is 30%, you end up paying 30%.

Some situations are more complicated, but for most people this means you don't pay extra tax. Still, every US citizen who earns more than a token amount is required to file a tax return every year no matter where they live. This alone is a considerable cost; I'm paying an accountant $2000 to do a US tax return that says I owe the IRS next to nothing.","1322699898"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Nowhere does the Pope say that condoms cause AIDS. The reason he condemns condoms isn't fully because condoms are contraception and thus immoral. There's also the argument that abstinence really *is* the best defense against AIDS.

Condoms fail. They're effective, but they can fail. If they only fail to protect against AIDS .1% of the time, and you have a population of 1,000,000 who actively use condems, you still have 100,000 people who were infected despite using condoms. 

From my perspective as a science minded Catholic, abstinence really is the best way to prevent the transmission of AIDS. I don't personally believe pre-marital sex is wrong. But not having sex will do a shit ton more then just wearing a condom. 

If you want to argue about married couples where one partner has AIDS, that's when it can get fuzzy, I'll admit. The Church says no condoms, which is actually a lesser issue in regards to AIDS. If your spouse has AIDS and you don't swing, then bam, you've effectively stopped the disease with you. 

On the flip side, the only reason a condom would be useful to a married couple is to avoid having children. But even then, much like the failure rate for AIDS prevention, that doesn't always work. The Catholic church doesn't crusade in the US to destroy contraception, and it never will. Married couples are entitled to the use of condoms if they want, and the Church won't actively stop that.

There's no winning move for either side. While the none Catholic side has the benefit of a more liberal social view on sex, the Catholic side has the benefit of an effective combat to AIDS. Take your pick.","1322699899"

Yeah, and you've had the privilege to get out of it. When you're in that funk, you can't see the stuff that gives you confidence. 

&gt; If you encourage people to think of the world as 'them and us', that they are not one of the 'lucky few' and they are totally powerless to do anything to help themselves, then you are not helping them, you are only encouraging them in their (false) belief that the only option is just to 'end it'. And that is a very irresponsible way to behave.

Except I'm not. You're posting with a swagger, telling us all that people need to do is ""change their way of thinking"" and then they will have motivation and confidence. Reality isn't like that, telling someone with depression ""just get over it"" doesn't work.  I'm not offering excuses for this group of people or encouraging victimhood, but the fact of the matter is that a part of the ""trans community"" is stuck there and stagnates there.

I have a theory as to why you stopped reading at the analogy and didn't go beyond it.  My theory is that you **suspended rational judgement** before you got to it, and ignored it altogether.  You put up a stop sign and stopped reading and thinking about my comment, because you knew that I would demonstrate you wrong.  Thus, by suppressing your own thought process, you accomplish two goals in one:

1. You manage the anxiety that my proving you wrong generated in you.
2. You give off the appearance that you have satisfactorily addressed my refutation, without actually having done so.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Have you considered the Boss DD-20 or the Digitech Timebender? These are both very similar to the DL-4--both have loopers (20 sec for Digitech, 23 sec for Boss), presets, tap tempo, multiple delay tones/colors--and in many cases more flexible, depending on what you want to do. If you dig through some of my threads, you'll find some good info on those units, as I've recommended them to some others here before. One thing to keep in mind with both those units is that they have analog pass-through, so your dry tone is never altered on an A/D/A conversion--you can basically plug them in anywhere, in front of amps, in loops, in the middle of a bunch of other pedals, and it will be harmless to your tone, no worries. Both of these pedals are built better than the DL-4 and won't mess with your tone. 

Boss DD-7 is a good pedal, but not nearly as flexible as the others mentioned here, and has no adjustable modulation--the modulated delay on that sounds a little on the fast side for me. I wish Boss would have given some more control over that feature! At least on the MXR Carbon Copy, you can open up the pedal and adjust some trim pots for depth and rate on the modulation :)

The TC Flashback is an amazing sounding delay, but everything I've read about it so far suggests that the ""strum tempo"" feature on it is just not as accurate as tap tempo. If you use delay as more of an ambient effect, this won't matter much, but if you're a player that really likes to have a rhythmic delay going a lot, you should read the threads about it on the gear forums (TheGearPage has a ton of threads about the Flashback). 

As far as the Nova Repeater goes, that is also a great delay, but if you find yourself really getting into delay and want to explore everything it can do, you might want to consider the TC Nova Delay, which is like it's bigger brother and not that much more expensive. The Nova Delay has more control and more flexibility--for example, on the Nova Delay you can have an analog ping-pong delay, but on the Nova Repeater you are restricted to having either/or (it only does ping-pong in digital delay mode, just like the DL-4). If you plan on playing in stereo, the Nova Delay is definitely the way to go!

If you don't mind buying used gear, the Eventide Timefactor prices are coming down, so you might not have to spend much more for that than a new DL-4. The Timefactor is basically a rack-quality delay that fits inside of a pedal, and it's incredible! Has a 20-second looper, MIDI, two independent delay circuits (great for different rhythmic delay stuff like U2) and an INSANE level of flexibility which beats the pants of anything else mentioned here so far. It can actually double as a chorus, and the modulated delays on there are breathtaking--it's actually better than a lot of rack units! John Petrucci actually had a little Timefactor sitting in the middle of his big rack rig for one of his recent tours.

His/her abilities aren't weak by any means, but unlike say Oka or Sif, they aren't directly helpful in killing things.  And the curse mechanic makes for some interesting choices you don't otherwise have to make, like, ""Do I curse this amulet of conservation in place?  Gives me better magic skills, but what if I run into a neqoxec?""  Moreover, having detect monster constantly active makes for a different, more cautious style of play - because you can be more cautious.  Basically, playing Ash feels different from playing one of the ""standard"" gods, without being a ridiculous challenge.  It's harder, but not because you could almost be playing atheist (which 3-rune TSO or Zin basically is, at least until places like Crypt and Zot).","1322699922"

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","Further conjecture: Sen's father was Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa dynasty. He had three male children: two legitimately, one illegitimately. The eldest was his heir and became Shogun. The youngest went on a violent rampage and was stripped of his titles and office (like Gwyn's Firstborn, although the ages are reversed). The bastard was hidden away by Hidetada but was eventually granted lordship over another family, and went on to self-deify himself and was enshrined as a deity after his death. Also interesting is that during this period in Japanese history, there was a lot of persecution of Christians and religious violence, something that I think is a bit of an undertone with Dark Souls (New Londo being flooded because the Four Kings have turned from the Gwyn's lordship, and the surviving Hollows spend their days prostrate before the ruins).

Given the Western fantasy imagery present in Dark Souls, it's hard to tell what inspiration the developers might have taken from their own culture and history!

We should try and see if Namco are interested in running a Q&amp;A session with Miyazaki with community-suggested questions. And not just simple gameplay questions that we can answer amongst ourselves like ""what do Divine and Occult weapons do?"", that'd be squandering the opportunity. Maybe we could get some more hints about the pendant, ask a question about Sen or find out whether Oscar was originally intended to have a bigger role in the game.","1322699924"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","DA trigger is not even worth pulling. Just consider it a fourth (fifth?) safety. Considering the reputation for non-accuracy small pistols have, I was skeptical, but apparently everything in 9x18 is disturbingly accurate.

The DA doesn't bother me, since once the hammer is pulled down, the pull is absolutely amazing for every shot after that (And the slide locks back on the last round, so it stays that way through the second mag).

Just for fun (Zombie targets ;) ) I stood at about ten yards and pulled the trigger as fast as I could, not rapid fire but just frantic squeezing. Still grouping around 6-8 inches. :)

I heard horror stories about recoil and slide bite, but have no problems (I have large but slender hands. My ham-fisted friend experienced a little bite). The frame and barrel are *very* solid and the recoil seems to cause a fair bit of motion, but no discomfort of any kind.

Put their food and water near the washer and the litter box too so they can eat and poop when you're not around.

And then when somebody does emerge, act all natural and cool about it.  Alfie's your best bet for first success.  Alfie caught Daisy's fear, but can un-catch it.

It's like the urban legends about razor blades hidden in apples and then passed out at Halloween.  There might have been one example or a few examples at some point, maybe not, but then people repeat it over and over, and hear it from multiple sources, and assume it's a widespread thing.  In the Halloween case, it confirms their paranoia that evil strangers are out to hurt their children.  With the HIV thing, it serves to confirm bigotry.

"Watches","t5_2qls5","&gt;Automatic winding movements will add about 4-8 jewels to help most efficiently transfer the relatively small rotor forces into winding the mainspring. Another factor has to do with how the watch is constructed - especially for chronograph movements and perpetual calendars. Some chronograph movements used today (including the ETA 2894-2) are modular in construction - meaning that a plate containing the chronograph works is grafted onto a basic timekeeping movement. Since the original timekeeping movements were not always designed with this in mind, it becomes critical for the add-on module to add as little ""drag"" as possible - which may indicate use of jewels for their low friction properties.

And that's exactly what I'm asking.  A 17 jewel ETA movement won't have those 4-8 jewels.  A 25 jewel movement might have all of them.  What effect will those extra 8 jewels have?","1322699935"

But to catch a bounty, you had to scan every single enemy (just in case) in a first person mode which didn't allow you to fire (and to my memory, even move).

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Of course there are many examples of coercive monopolies under statist systems - mankind has never lived in a stateless society.  I also disagree with Greenspan's assertion that closed entry to a market can only be created government action - through subsidy, etc.  Market entry can be closed, or restricted so heavily that a de facto monopoly exists in most areas, by the use of predatory pricing and price gouging.  This combined with the control of resources and means of production establishes markets of scale that cannot be threatened by local competitors.  To claim that only government can create these conditions, whilst simultaneously claiming that Rockefeller's Standard Oil existed as large as it did because ""the market could only sustain one large company"" is sophistry.  Also, Rockefeller used bribery as a means to expand his company - so I hardly see why Greenspan would use that example anyways.

The defense of the monopoly and exploitation claim both rely on what is essentially a rhetorical trick - that because someone has consented to something that means there is no coercion involved. 

This is the fundamental split between the libertarian left and the libertarian right.  The concept that economic structures can be coercive is completely rejected by the right, using the defense that people can simply choose not to contract with these so called coercive organizations.  Of course the reality is that we don't know if monopoly can exist without government - because we haven't had society without government.","1322699943"

"darknetplan","t5_2rju2","&gt; Ahh, That makes sense. Not possible for rural area users like me to go ISPless. Though if the goal is to have another protocol and a new way to ID individual users. i guess it could work.
The whole point of meshnet now alludes me more than before... I would understand if it was to avoid SOAP. But there are many ways to get around SOAP already. To Eliminate ISPs won't happen. No way the net could stream vids over interconnected wifi.... It simply wont happen...
I thought this was a sorta cool idea...(Free net and all that) Now I figure this is just a joke by a bunch of morons who didn't bother to research the amplitude of ways to bypass filtering....

There are many ways around DNS filtering and even IP blocking, but the average user doesn't know how to use them. If these workarounds are built into Meshnet, users won't have to think about it.

It's possible that content could be identified by hash and stored locally so there's not that many hops between server and client. I'm thinking that there would have to be some incentive to route and host traffic, like a points system similar to BitCoin that can be traded on a secondary market. That way, I can open up my own little Meshnet ISP which has no idea what content I'm routing and hosting, just that bits are coming in and out and I'm getting points for making that happen. 

Ideally the economics would be such that this network could replace cellular networks, and that traffic would be VOIP instead. Certainly you have a cellular signal where you are. I know there's many other factors, but I'm just saying it's not unimaginable.

I think pretty much everyone has that fear at some point. Don't beat yourself up over it, but it's good that you recognize that it's not entirely rational. You're not going to be burned at the stake when you come out of the closet. People from all walks of life are out, and you can still be a movie-star/astronaught/congressperson/athlete as an out GLBT person. When you start getting all worried that someone might find out you're bi, just try to take a step back and think ""what if they do?""


If your manager is a regular at a gay bar, he probably won't have a problem with it. If he is very close to your brother, that means your brother will probably be ok with it too. Tell people when you feel you're ready, but that's at least a good sign.

She was used to drama, so she'd cause it if there wasn't anything going on. She grew up with abusive parents, had an abusive ex stalking her, and she was hooking up with one of my good friends even though she knew he had a girlfriend. I feel bad for her because she is usually the victim. She grew up with a lot of drama, so she's used to it. She started bringing it around my apartment though. Her crazy ex tried to friend me on facebook and I didn't want him coming around. I could handle it if he did come around, I'm bigger than him, but I just didn't want that around. We got drunk one night and made-out. It could have gone further, but I stopped once I realized what I was doing. Two weeks later she found out that she was pregnant with her ex's baby. I feel bad for her, but I don't talk to her anymore. She's the type of person you want to help out, but she just keeps on finding a way to have drama in her life. It's either a dumb decision or she just creates some drama out of nothing.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I know people who have gone through this and have seen the inevitable unhappiness that comes along with.  Ultimately, I think anyone considering it will be happier down the road by working on their self-image issues, rather than undergoing drastic, irreversible physical changes.  I have no problem with a woman acting or dressing like a man, but think in the long run they are doing themselves a great disservice by trying to physically alter their bodies to *emulate* that of a man.  Society will never accept them as a man and while I understand that this is close minded, I also realize that sometimes we have to be realistic about our goals.  I have a classmate who is going through the exact same thing right now and it's clear to everyone that what was once an attractive woman is now an extremely feminine looking woman doing her best to appear like a man.  It's overwhelmingly clear that she will never be anything but an androgynous, hybrid stuck between genders.  I completely respect her decision and her right to do it.  All I'm saying is that these people build up switching sexes as a solution to all/most of their problems and then are disappointed and trapped when they discover that it has only created more.  I'm just trying to give this young woman the honest, hard truth before it's too late because I know for a fact that most people she trusts are too concerned with her immediate well-being/feelings to subject her to the realities of her decision.  If she wants to act like a man that's perfectly fine, but I strongly believe that attempting to physically alter her gender is a one way ticket to permanent unhappiness.  By taking this path she is alienating herself from a significant portion of potential partners.  Another concern is that even if she looks the part in every possible way, she will inevitably suffer when she finds a potential partner who runs the other direction when they hear the truth.  Yea you could say she doesn't need someone like that, but let's be honest here--the majority of us would be at least somewhat upset upon discovering both the fact that our SO was actually our own gender on top of discovering that there was no possibility of ever bearing a child that was biologically (both) of our own. Why not just act however she wants to act and not worry about how the world perceives her gender.  It would be one thing if some amazing advance in science allowed her to actually become a man, but we all know that even the most successful genders re-assignment patients are lucky to fool someone that's nearly blind.  Sometimes the truth can be harsh, but that's what she needs to hear--not the overly idealistic lies she keeps having reenforced by people who care more about her feelings then her long-term well-being.  The fact that she gets so upset anytime someone questions her decision leads me to conclude that she has many of these same doubts I have described.  After all, once you hit the point of no return the only options are to either convince yourself that it was the right choice or spend the rest of your life unsatisfied.  She doesn't have to like it, and to be honest what this reality says about society upsets me too, but this is they way it is, so I hope she will at least consider this advice before writing it off and taking it to a point where when it inevitably doesn't work out she is doomed to a life of unhappiness.

He is not a great finisher, he is an awful passer, he is weak when marked and he has awful ball control. Berbatov is the opposite of Hernandez. He's slow and not great at positioning, but he's a great passer, amazing ball control, keeps the ball amazingly well when pressured and is not a great finisher. Hernandez is chosen simply because Berbatov does not fit well into United's current awful style of play. He'd fit in better with Arsenal. It's unfair to presume Hernandez would have made a difference in this match. Did Hernandez not play in the horrendous 4-0 home loss to west ham last year? Macheda is atrocious and Berbatov is having a bad season, but hernandez is not anything close to as good a footballer as van persie or higuain and it's right he is getting some valid criticisms.

Hernandez can score important goals, but he is not anywhere near as consistent as people make out. He has a high goals per shot ratio because he does nothing but hit tap ins.","1322699968"

I waited for his review and  I expected more.

Whole review seemed like he didn't know what to put there, it lacked substance and actual jokes...  first minute of the review is actually reminiscence of his previous FPS gameplays.. 

Then comes the weak joke about adventurers, followed by his confused idea that he had an option while escaping and not realizing that he escaped with an imperial guy....

Generally most jokes there were not funny, older episode seems much more fun and it was like he didn't really know what to talk about. 

Skyrim has some big flaws, yet he failed to mention a lot of them. I always liked his reviews since he point those flaws out in an entertaining way but here I feel like he failed. 

When he fucking applaud the horse, a big dump animal that you have to babysit or it gets itself killed 5 times a day, I knew that there is no redemption for him...

If he DO like the game immensely, then please, do ignore the flaws but get me also pumped and exited about it(portal, batman, just cause,..)  but all I felt was aura of indifference from his part, like he made review based on someones else description of the gameplay...","1322699971"

"3DS","t5_2ruhy","[""Nintendo would come down about three times a year and rip on most of the games,"" a Retro employee told Electronic Gaming Monthly in April 2001. In 2000, Miyamoto himself visited Retro, an event compared to the Emperor visiting the Death Star. But a closer parallel might be the 2003 film Lost in Translation, where Bill Murray plays an American actor vainly trying to get direction from a Japanese- speaking filmmaker. A former Retro employee recalls, ""[Miyamoto] would rant at us in Japanese for a minute and a half, and then the translator would just say, 'He's upset.'""](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/issues/issue_39/235-Metroid-Primed.2)

Edit to add my $0.02: Miyamoto is probably a good boss.  The thing is, he's in a position where he is trusted and he is always surrounded by talent.  His main job at this point is to provide ideas and inspiration, and to critique and decide on what stays versus what goes.  He might be a hard-ass but the thing is, you can still be a good boss AND a hard-ass, if you the decisions you make are good.  I know people who aren't in management who critique that ""Anyone can do a job where you just look at stuff and say ""yes"" or ""no"" as it comes up!"".  That's true, if you don't keep track of how many of your answers are actually good decisions.

Basically, I'll excuse a hard-ass like Miyamoto or Steve Jobs if they at least are making good design and business decisions.  And the fact that Miyamoto mentions a specific case where he feels his decision was WRONG in the original article highlights that he does keep track of his decisions.","1322699973"

I'm straight and I want to tell you a little bit about what my friends and I used to do in High School. All of my friends that I did this stuff with were all straight (besides one, who came out of the closest our senior year). We did everything you did and more. At our sleepovers we used to tea bag or mushroom slap whoever ended up falling asleep first. Everyone usually slept in their boxers, and it was not uncommon to find wake up next to someone with either your arm around them or their's around you. I've played chicken games where dick grabbing happened to not be the last thing people ended up backing off from. I've been slapped with an inside out condom several times... and yes that means I've had my friend's semen on me before. We also did other stuff that was around this caliber, too.


All my friends from high school are still straight as far as I know, besides the one that came out 4 years ago.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The very unfortunate aspect of it, from a standpoint of ethics and philosophy, is that it is often used to provide encouragement for a very false (but very widespread) belief - that if you are willing to sacrifice ethics, you can actually make better progress than you can while being ""limited"" by them.  History shows this to be false.  In every case where there are 'hard men' making 'hard decisions' behind the scenes, they only spread tragedy.  Usually the ""benefits"" they claim are things that exist DESPITE them, not because of them.  For instance, no secret police force has ever been shown to have improved the lives of the nations they claim to serve.  But we have ample evidence of them doing tremendous damage ""in the best interests of the people"".  

One of the fundamental tenets of democracy and egalitarian viewpoints is that these sort of nonconsentual situations are fundamentally more damaging than openness and consent of the governed.  Many people are convinced that if the general public gets to control the government it would just be a huge disaster, but we've already run this experiment.  Their fears are misplaced.  And their faith in being able to find 'special' people who are better at making important decisions than the public at large has been proven disastrous again and again.","1322699976"

Sterility has a pretty strict definition which means that absolutely no biological life can exist in it. A sterile substance can't support life.

This is not true of urine. I've seen wikipedia make incorrect claims before and this is just another instance of that.

This myth reminds me of the similar, yet less disgusting, myth that beer is sterile. As a brewer I can assure you it is not. It _is_ mildly antiseptic, but it's certainly not sterile.

Because a radish bulb is porous, the absorbtion of liquid into its surface is not entirely a function of its biological processes. This is why I say I wouldn't eat it if it has already bulbed. If it's still in it's root stage chances are, as long as you can keep the animals from continuing to urinate on the plant, it will be fine to eat.

If it's already bulbed it can absorb urine, not just the water from urine, but the urine itself, even it the plant's organic processes normally would filter undesirable chemicals from it when uptaking liquid.","1322699981"

Some marked-up notes [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/26837128/Untitled%20Cinematography%20Final%20Piece.2.pdf)  
    
In general:    
    
1. What makes this apocalyptic? If you hadn't told us that, there's nothing in the script to indicate it. Could be a homeless man wandering in the woods, attacking a woman in a shack.     
2. Try to avoid on-the-nose-dialogue. By which I mean, trying to give exposition in the view, not the dialogue. Preserve mysteries.     
3. What's your ""author's intent""? Am I supposed to feel bad for the man? The woman? Most disaster genre is a critique of society. I'm not seeing that here.     
4. In my markup, you'll see I deleted the first three scenes. There were boring with nothing but exposition. Are you hoping to set ""tone"" with those? If so, give it a twist, as it is, it reads like a standard lone-wolf-backpacks-through-wasteland. Zzzzzzzzz.....
5. Following the immortal questions of Aristotle, ""Why now?"" what's special about this day, that the man dies? Does it matter? How close is he to the edge. 
6. I love disaster flicks, but that's because they are like jigsaw puzzles. Throw me some toys to play with.","1322699992"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","If we assume we are powering a 100W lightbulb from 10m away and ignoring all contributions except resistance of the lightbulb/wire for the wire and intensity loss from Rayleigh scattering for the laser it comes out like this:

Wire (#14 AWG @ 120V Ω/m = .008286):

I_bulb = P_bulb/V = 100/120 = .833 amps to power lightbulb

R_bulb = V/I_bulb = 120/.833 = 144 Ω

R_wire = .008286*10=.08286 Ω

P_loss = (R_wire)*I_bulb^2 = .0575 W

% lost = 100*P_loss/(P_loss+P_bulb) = **.0575%**


For the laser lets assume similar beam to [this one](http://www.bewild.com/hiingrlapo.html) the intensity of the beam is 1.9 W/cm^2.  We'll also assume an all nitrogen environment for simplicity.  According to [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering) intensity loss per meter for the wavelength in nitrogen is about .001%

So over 10m we lose 100(.00001)^10 = .099% intensity resulting in 1.89981 W/cm^2
In order to power a 100W lightbulb at this intensity (assuming no conversion losses at the other end of the laser) we need a cross sectional area of 52.6 cm^2 (circle ~8cm in diameter) and experience a power loss of .099 W or .099%.

So at this scale the laser has about twice the loss of the wire. Even assuming no conversion losses at the other end of the laser.

If instead of 10m we plug in 1000m the power losses are
Wire:  5.4%
Laser: 99%!!

Since the intensity drop goes exponentially with distance while power loss in a wire is linear it gets terribly inefficient at large ranges.  This could be mitigated by using a longer wavelength (Intensity drop goes as ~λ^−4) but its still a fundamental obstacle.

Those were good times when money was easy to make and everything was free. it was like a gold rush! New freebie companies were popping up further escalating the frenzy. I think from 2006-2008 or 2009 i raked in $10,000 worth of items and cash. 
My haul was...


* 42"" dell plasma

* 42"" Panasonic plasma

* $700 amazon gift card

* PSP

* 5 or 6 ipods (range from shuffles to video ipods and of all size)

* cash or gift cards ranging from $250-$500

* 19"" LCD TV

* macbook pro

* probably more but i cant remember the rest..


Back in the days, people pay $25-$40 for you sign up! And each offer that you complete are either free or you simply pay for S&amp;H which is $5 so you still make over 500% from what u put in! All of this can be done in 10-20mins. But now times are tough and the payout is not as good anymore. 
Back in 2006 a 42""plasma retails at $2k+ requires only 12 offers you complete on your own( est about $5 per offer so $60)
But now i bet for that same 2k item its 24 offers PLUS 2 referrals ( both of which must complete the 24 offers to qualify YOU for the TV)

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows. For as a Christian I have also a duty to my own people.

-Adolf Hitler, in a speech in Munich, 12 April 1922

&gt;In the Bible we find the text, 'That which is neither hot nor cold will I spew out of my mouth.' This utterance of the great Nazarene has kept its profound validity until the present day.

-Adolf Hitler, speech in Munich, 10 April 1923

&gt;We are a people of different faiths, but we are one. Which faith conquers the other is not the question; rather, the question is whether Christianity stands or falls.... We tolerate no one in our ranks who attacks the ideas of Christianity... in fact our movement is Christian. We are filled with a desire for Catholics and Protestants to discover one another in the deep distress of our own people.

-Adolf Hitler, in a speech in Passau, 27 October 1928, Bundesarchiv Berlin-Zehlendorf, [cited from Richard Steigmann-Gall's The Holy Reich]

In just these three quotes you find that Hitler: identified himself as a Christian, read the Bible, considered Germany a Christian nation, and believed that it was his duty, as a Christian, to exterminate the Jewish population in and around Germany.

Also, the ""*faith and hope and love*"" from your first quote comes directly from I Corinthians 13:13.

I'm not trying to draw parallels between Christians or Christianity and Hitler, but I am saying that Hitler was a Christian.  To deny that is to deny his own words in his speeches and in Mein Kampf.  This whole no true Scotsman, ""Hitler wasn't *really* a Christian"" shit needs to stop.","1322700006"

My undergrad had its own FML site which started my junior year. I was a regular poster, venting my heartbreaks and gripes. I also was one of the more positive, optimistic commenters. Most people cracked racist, sexist jokes, but I'd often try to cheer people up. 

I ended up getting into a heartfelt conversation with a guy called GoYourOwnWay about potentially destructive romances. I'd just been treated very poorly by an ex, he was trying to start a bad romance with a girl who he knew was going to hurt him, and I was able to talk him out of it. We conversed for a week or so by laggy comment, and then lost contact. 

First week of Senior year, I was at my ballroom dance club, and my regular dance partner introduces me to his summer roommate, a new dancer. A week of chatting and some conversations by Facebook, and we both realize that we recognized each other's writing style and personal details. 

We went out until I left for graduate school, and he's still my best friend.

"socialism","t5_2qjii","&gt;And anyone else, socialist or not, who opposed their monopoly on power

Sure, but they still beat the reaction. Other socialists didn't. They died or compromised.

&gt;They reorganised the economy so that it was centrally run by Party officials, mind explaining how that's ""more democratic""?

Well it was centrally planned, mostly by party members, with some input from workers' councils. The economy was planned so that it benefited the majority of Soviet citizens in a way that capitalism did not. That's more democratic than what preceded it. Sure, it was far from perfect, but that isn't what I'm arguing. I'm arguing that it is absurd to reject actual historical socialist revolutionary history as a whole because it doesn't live up to your contemporary standards of how things should have been done.

&gt;So much for internationalism.

If you understood the reference I made and how it relates to Lenin's writings on the National Question you would understand how wrong that statement is.

&gt;Nothing to do with Socialism.

I guess the mode of production was beside the point? That's some fine materialism!

&gt;collectivization"" was a euphemism for appropriation of peasant lands by the Party, which caused a massive famine.

Are you not a socialist? Serious question (Edit: I don't mean this to sound like I'm questioning your radical bona fides, I'm just curious what your ideological background is). The State appropriated land from the old landowners and the wealthy peasants and ran it under collectivized conditions. This was done badly, and exacerbated famine conditions especially since Moscow moved produce out of the Ukraine. It wasn't a euphemism for anything, but it does seem like it was pretty incompetently managed. Does that invalidate the USSR's attempt to build socialism? Of course not.

There isn't really anything to disagree with on your list of bad shit that Stalinism did. The problem I think is that you ignore Stalinism's successes, many of which I already listed. How do we avoid something like Stalinism? It's as simple as not repeating their mistakes. One can engage in a Leninist organization while acknowledging it's history and working not to repeat mistakes. In fact this is what most Leninists do. 

Edit: Now that I'm a bit less rushed and off my phone, I want to add that I think that the cultural revolution is the best model for how the people and the party should interact.

If you have ever taken a survey for scientific research you are partaking in a scientific study of your opinion. As long as it is testable and falsifiable, it is science.

Your engine code should have two separate updates, one for updating game logic (collisions, movement, player input etc) and one for drawing. 

Game logic always has the higher priority between the two. It doesn't matter if you have 120 FPS if nothing on screen is moving. Game logic also doesn't concern itself with this rounding problem. Use floats for everything, don't worry about rounding. If the player coordinates are (19.45934, -5023.32219) so be it. You DO need to worry about the frame rate problem here though. 

The drawing logic should use the data from the game logic to draw. Not sure what you're using, but most graphics library will let you use float coordinates for vertices. The graphics card will take care of what exact pixel position to draw it at. All that xextra stuff is confusing and unnecessary. ","1322700017"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Don't lie in an interview.  Emphasize your good traits, downplay your bad traits, that's just part of being a good salesman.  But don't lie.

I've gone into interviews and been very vocal about not having any experience in their field.  Like, applying for a position as a Java developer with zero experience in Java.  Pretty much every answer I gave in my technical interview was prefaced with, ""Well I'm not familiar with how Java does it, but in C++...""  Still got an offer.

I've also put some horrible references on my applications, professors who probably didn't even recognize my name when they were called.  The interviewer even told me not to use that guy anymore since they've tried calling him before for other applicants from my school and he says the same things about everybody.  Still got an offer.

Experience and references, while important, won't get in your way as much as a lie can.  Be honest with your employer, even when it makes you look a little bad, and they'll trust you with the things you *are* good at. (But you do still have to be good at those things...)

And if you're as excited about the job as you sound, *make sure they know that!*  Enthusiasm and self-motivation can make up for a lack of experience, especially if you're young (and thus cheaper to hire than someone with experience).  If you go that route, make sure you have some good (and *truthful*) examples of your self-motivation.  I like listing some of my more interesting hobbies at the bottom of my resume for exactly that reason.  They're great icebreakers, they let you build rapport with your interviewer and give you an opportunity to brag about yourself without being so obvious about it.","1322700022"

The crux of the issue is that EVERYONE under a certain age has grown up playing games, literally everyone. There has been no sharp rise in the numbers of violent crimes committed, in fact, in the UK violent crime has been going down steadily for a number of years.

It is simply a case of people of a certain age looking back at their youth and thinking ""There weren't as many crimes in my day"" when actually that is complete bullshit, humanity has always had crime in a percentage that is consistent with the population and socio-economic situation of that population. The poorer people are, the more viable a life of crime becomes to earn a decent amount of money. That is not to say, of course, that all poor people are perps, just that the lure is heightened when life is harder to live on fewer means.

"politics","t5_2cneq","This is indeed an excellent response. I have one qualm, though -- Israel was in no way an underdog. Even though they formally declared Independence in 1948, they had been developing a government for a long time before that, already had a military strategy, and had the backing of several European countries. The Arab League was never a true threat, as most countries had only existed a couple years and were on the verge of collapse after being occupied and dominated for a couple decades (at the least). Distrust was high after being separate for so long, and many in the Arab League inadequately prepared for war out of fear that, when they won, an opposing nation would take control. There were several well-populated Palestinian cities left with farmer's weapons to fend off the Israeli invasion because neither side was willing to trust the other with weapon caches. In short, Palestine was a lost cause in the first war due to greed and ineffective military strategy.

As for economic development: the first 2 generations of Jews were essentially European citizens who were highly educated and displaced who had international backing. To expect them to do anything less than make a former ""desert"" bloom would be surprising. You are comparing their progress to that of a mostly pastoral nation. This isn't a fault... in fact, most Jews initially coming in thought everybody was winning, as they would employ Arabs and increase their standard of living.

"engineering","t5_2qhpi","This one isn't my professor for the course but one of the assistant professors while our main professor was out for the day. 

Quick background, I am a Computer Engineer with an emphasis in Computer Architecture. One of the courses I am taking this year is called CMOS design. Basically it is learning about the process of designing CMOS logic on silicon. 

During part of the course we learn about the manufacturing process of CPUs. For this class our AP was talking about the process for a recent chip that the he and the professor had designed and recently ordered. They had recently received the masks for for one of the layers for their CPU. Our wise professor thought it would be a brilliant idea to bring this new mask to class and show us it. In retrospect it was a good idea, but practically you should know better than to bring toys to class and not expect the worst.

The worst case is someone touching either the top or the bottom of the glass layers that protect the film. This glass is less than 1mm thick and can break very easily. You have to hold the mask on the the side. The AP started to pass the mask around, in the class of 30. I am on the far right, mask began on the far left. I received the mask and passed it to the person in front. I looked down to take notes and than looked up to see the person in front of me passing it forward. The person in the very front than proceeds to grab the mask on the top and bottom with one fist rather than on the sides. The mask shatters instantly. The guy than quickly proceeds to pass it to the next person in line, like nothing happened. 

The AP did not find out about the broken mask until the very end of the lecture. I did not want to stick around to find out what would happen to the student that broke it. I still do not know if he confronted the teacher and confessed. What I do know is that the guy did break a $2.4 million piece of equipment. 

tl;dr do not bring expensive engineering equipment to class and show it off. It will most likely break. ","1322700036"

Fitzpatrick goes up against Tennessee this week and their middle-of-the-road defense vs. QBs. He had a great week against a bad match-up last week so who knows how important the match-up is in the first place.

All of this said, I'd start Tebow because I have no faith whatsoever that Fitzpatrick's game last week wasn't a fluke. He's been bad more than he's been good and isn't really worth the chance when Tebow's track record says he's worth at least 15 points and has a terrific match-up.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","1. If you like music and nature, yes. Lots of water activities, trails, parks, and cool camping just outside of town. Any type of live music, any day of the week. The guy who said it has too many people is just grumpy. Yes, Austin was way better in the 1950's when only 150,000 people were here, but times they do change and Austin is still fucking bad ass compared to other cities of its size.

2. Summers are brutal, no lie. In August this year it seemed like it was 110+ every day. For me it's not so much during the day that hurts, but the nights don't drop below 75 and it's difficult to sleep sometimes because it's so hot/humid.

3. Travis Heights and Barton Hills are just to the south of downtown, within easy biking distance, and very near Zilker Park (which is awesome). Hyde Park is a nice neighborhood that has more reasonable prices, north of campus a bit. If you are going for cheapest cost, check out places on Riverside, although that's not an easy biking area nor the most secure. I think Hyde Park is probably the best balance for what you are looking for, but if you can find a decently priced room in the 78704 zip code that would be ideal, I'd imagine.

4. Barton Springs Saloon has $1 Lonestars on Mondays. If you make it down I will personally buy you one.","1322700050"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","I agree with everything you said, except your quoted bit. That's a colossal load of bullshit. That's the same thing as saying, ""You can't be racist towards white people because they're the privileged class in our society"". I understand where you're coming from when you say that, you're trying to distinguish between bigotry coming from the privileged class to the non-privileged class and vice versa, and there is certainly a distinction worth making there. But I disagree completely that racism is anything other than racism, and that sexism is anything other than sexism.

And before you start quoting things at me, this is all a matter of semantics. My opinion is not some off the cuff reaction to your post, it's actually the result of several conversations with a sociology professor and my 'sex and gender' professor about these things. While the impact of bigotry can certainly differ based on who's doing it to who, that doesn't mean you get to just redefine a word to mean what you want it to mean. If something is bigoted against one particular gender or sex, that's sexism. ","1322700050"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Yeah, Eisenhower proposed that interstates be built in response to Germany building the autobahn. He knew at the time that the autobahn was far superior in terms of engineering, but didn't want to seem like he was copying the Nazis. So instead of building long superhighways where people could travel at high speeds and possibly cut travel time in half, he chose the current interstate system.

Chances are if Eisenhower had ditched his pride the US would have a handful of autobahns that run similar lengths to I-5, I-95, I-40, etc. Once you reach the area you want to be in then you get off onto a highway network. This would be a huge benefit for people who could then choose to live outside of major cities then commute without having traffic be their top worry. Granted our traffic laws would have had to reflect Germany's as well.

The other thing is cost vs volume. The autobahn certainly cost more to maintain than a US interstate per mile, but it can handle a lot more cars for a lot longer which factor into externalities and thus drive up interstate costs far more than they're worth.","1322700054"

Aren't most theistic religions like that to some degree?

Anyways, we call ourselves the Chosen people but I'm not forcing down your throat that we are the Chosen People. Rather, you (and a lot of reddit) seem to enjoy making this point that we call ourselves this and thus we think we are better, which kinda demonizes Judaism as this ""WE ARE BETTER SO LISTEN TO US"". I don't think there's much special about me, personally, and I don't advocate everyone converting to Judaism (frankly, I don't follow most of the rules, myself because there are so many).

* Prayer - yes, in thanking and in asking.

* God/Creator - yes, active role is not impossible though personally it a passive-active type of role.

* Jesus Christ - Human being exploited by other humans in order to brainwash a whole bunch of other humans.

* Revealed Religion/Religious texts - Aside from some of them seeming to have a few coincidences with alien appearances(YES Ancient Aliens), I believe revealed religion to be completely fabricated by human hands for controlling purposes.

* The natural world is my personal proof of God and God's power/glory.

* Atheists - they vary from well educated/respectful to ignorant asshole who are possibly lashing out at their environment for having been indoctrinated into religion.

* Agnostics - those that stand between Atheists and Deists

* Not understanding Deists - all too common, to most people it's either black or white... Religious Theist or Atheistic (Having a discussion with an Atheist who claims that all Theists are religious at this very moment)

* Discussing Deism - quite interesting and I enjoy reading the posts of the people here. However, I find it to be a personal belief/philosophy, one that varies person to person as we are not bound by specifics. 

* After death - cannot know for certain... Either the same thing as what you experience during non-REM sleep(just pure blackness no dreams, no concept of existence, etc.) Or one of many possible after-lives(Spirit world, New Life, Different Life, Rejoining the Akashik Records, etc.).

* Immortal Soul - a subject of much debate but similar to the question of afterlife. We'd first have to discuss what we all believe a ""Soul"" *is* and then discuss what behavior a soul may have.

Please feel free to answer your own questions as well :)

On a side note: personally I love discussing religion/God/Life Philosophies with anyone who has a mind of their own and respect for other people's beliefs.

About traffic I suppose it could be argued that the cost of bringing road traffic into line with the rest of Europe will only grow as infrastructure is developed over the year (so save money by acting sooner if integration is expected eventually anyway). You could probably have done the change for less than a tenth of the latest round Quantitative Easing money that the BoE has 'printed' in the hope that buying assets from the financial industry will somehow trickle down into the economy.

There will also be costs every year associated with having a different standard from the rest of the EU, this BBC [article](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8239048.stm) makes a few points for and against. I don't really have a strong opinion about it and drive just fine on either side of the road myself.","1322700061"
"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","&gt; I'm not ready to come out

This is why that guy didn't want to date you.  No offense, but you predicate your whole fear of coming out on the idea that something horrible will happen.  Why would you say to a potential boyfriend, ""Hey, I'm about to go through a lot of fucked up drama.  Want to start dating?""

You sound like you're literally (figuratively) inches away from coming out and that you're just using this bad experience as a temporary justification for your fear of coming out when in reality, you had plenty of opportunity to tell this guy, ""If you want to date, I will come out,"" and you didn't do that.  You can't simultaneously have really wanted to come out with and also not have given this even the slightest real chance.

You wouldn't have written this long post if you weren't in the closet when you met this guy.  You won't write another one like this *ever again* if you handle your business and come out before trying to date someone else.

PS, 

&gt; getting to know another guy while talking to me

I'm not sure what relationship values are in your community, but where I'm from (Tennessee), it's more than normal to express interest in more than one person at a time when all you're doing is ""talking"" or ""dating"".  It sounds like you and he could barely have been further from being in some kind of committed, monogamous relationship, so why is it a problem that he was interested in someone else too while ""talking"" to you?  Your dating life will be much more fulfilling and happy if you don't equate ""talking"" (by which I mean thinking about maybe dating) with ""we're on track to get married.""

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Quiagar didn't give a simpler answer so that he wouldn't create a misperception, as you have.  Your description of ""files, folders, and work environments from a graphical perspective"" is what an **X Window Manager** or a *Desktop Environment* does.

X has three parts, only one of which you have described.  It is important to know of the 3 parts so that you know it was specifically designed from the very beginning to let you *run* a program on one computer while *displaying* it on an entirely different computer across a network or across the world.

Also, because of this difference, Windows lets you customize its appearance and behavior slightly, but X allows you to create drastically different behavior and appearance based on your choice of favorite window manager.  E.g., do you like multiple desktops or not? do you like a lot of crap around the edge of a window or not? What keys would you like to use to change between windows?  Should a window pop to the top when you mouse over it? or only when you click on it?

All the user appearance behaviors like that are up to you and are *totally unrelated* to how programs communicate with the server.  I.e., the guy who writes the program doesn't know or care what key you use to open and close the window.

There's no reason to argue with a cook when he's preparing me a good meal, there's reason to argue with a Christian who, idk, post dozens of pictures of dead babies all around my campus, or calls out that people are fat as they are walking by and going to hell because of it.

[...]
Some maintain that Christ did not go to the place of the damned, which is what is generally understood today by the word ""Hell"". For instance, Thomas Aquinas taught that Christ did not descend into the ""Hell of the lost""

But I have seen first hand how ineffective AVAST and AVG are also many stories of them false flagging key system files. To top it off they are very annoying with their update notifications and splash screens and a very noticeable hit on system resources. 

Back in the day they were better then nothing but now that MSE is here they serve no purpose. 

All that said in order for someone to be as safe as possible they need a script blocker of some sort like NoScript running on their browser and they need a little lesson about what type of sites need to be allowed and what sites do not need or should not be allowed. One could also sandbox the browser but that's taking it to a extreme. Steady State is one I use in office environments that is full proof but extreme measure.

"Meditation","t5_2qnc9","Are you sure you're practicing vipassana and not concentration meditation? I made the mistake of thinking concentration meditation (on my breath) was insight practice for years and also felt disconnected from my life. I thought that I was watching what is but realized I had been making my breath a permanent object. Then I tried to replace all the feelings in my life with the feelings of contentment I got from concentration. In the short run you can try metta meditation as this could get you out of the habit of not feeling but eventually you have to start doing insight practice to really get past this numbness. 

'Not feeling' is actually the feeling of suppression and those emotions of suffering are still there but just weak from being suppressed. When I realized what true vipassana was and that it differed from samatha, that is when I started to really take off in meditation. You must not just focus on one object of meditation but watch each sensation vibrate and flicker. This is its true nature (impermanence, suffering and non-self) and when you do this you truly become the observer that lets anything arise (including emotions). If you continue with just samatha you will only be continuing to bulldoze your emotions with concentration. ","1322700092"

"Buddhism","t5_2qhnf","If you are in the US, you will find that practice centers generally align into one of three main groups: 1) Theravedan, 2) Tibetan, and 3) Zen. In each of these there are multiple different lineages and ways of teaching or ""schools."" In Buddhism, you are not a ""believer"" or parishioner, but a ""student."" I recommend you read Stephen Batchelor Buddhism Without Beliefs, to get the overview version of the buddhist perspective on human suffering and what can be done about it (all religions are essentially trying to address this issue). Then find an introductory text that describes the historical and cultural development of buddhism. As for practice, here in the US, if you are relatively new, I suggest going to the website of the Insight Meditation Society. No mysticism. No devotional practices. Nothing that can be construed as ""worshiping"" anything-- just great teachings on practice and ""dharma talks"" on what the concepts mean. You'll find lots of audio on there of various teachings giving talks. Pretty much any of the books by affiliated teachers will offer some great introductions to different concepts. It's a great place to start. When you have a foundation it will make sense to start to try and understand how Tibetan buddhism developed and what its gifts are, and its various schools, and it will also make sense to take a gander at Zen, again with its many schools and approaches. And, be aware, that just like in Christianity, in buddhism the different schools tend to regard themselves righteously and others as ""not getting it."" Or at least, you will find people within every school who make such claims. Ignore all that. You will know you are in the right place to learn at this time in your life when what is being said to you rings true and when the practices arouse your curiosity rather than your scorn or judgement.

I was trying to be civil but when confronted by actual evidence in the form of actual proof from a court opinion you decided to resort to profanity and childishness. I was merely trying to explain the flaw in your reasoning. Its not that hard of a concept. If you steal a car bought for $20,000 that has been used and is now worth $5000 dollars you are liable for the $5000 value of the car that has been converted because of theft. Not $20k because the car has lost value when used by the owner due to depreciation. The cable is a luxury good so its has an upward sloping demand curve unlike most conventional items which means most of the value in the item is the fact that it is expensive once used this value drops dramatically. Its the same reason luxury cars depreciate faster because most of the value of being able to say ""Look I bought this expensive thing cause I'm awesome."" Likewise the luxury value of the cable depreciates almost immediately with use thus making it less valuable, I'm not saying by how much or that it would even make a difference in potential criminal charges just that your starting point is in correct.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","In Canada, the prohibition was challenged by couples wishing to get married in court, on the grounds that it violated the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (part of the constitution). The courts of a few provinces legalized it, and then the Supreme Court of Canada gave the government 2 years to change the laws for the whole country, or invoke the notwithstanding clause, which would have allowed them to keep it illegal. There was fierce opposition from the more conservative parts of the country, but the government pushed the new laws through.

I believe the Vatican said that any of the MP's who supported legalization would be condemned to Hell. The Prime Minister at the time, who is Catholic, gave the following speech just prior to the vote, I think.

A huge part of chemical engineering is dealing with the heat given off by large scale reactions.

lately I've been doing small scale reactions with PCL3 (which is hilariously toxic when it gets in the air and boils at 76C)  If this reaction were to ever get too hot bad bad things would happen.

""PCl3 is toxic, with a concentration of 600 ppm being lethal in just a few minutes.[8] PCl3 is classified as very toxic and corrosive under EU Directive 67/548/EEC, and the risk phrases R14, R26/28, R35 and R48/20 are obligatory.""

It's a large part of why Martha Stewart, Microsoft, and Pokemon have become such massive successes. Really, the only problem I see is its *misuse*.

No, the corporate phrase that bothers me is ""work ethic"". As if the way you approach your job is itself an ethical decision. Should you do something because you're getting paid for it? Should you do it to keep your job? No, you should do it to ""have a good work ethic"". Just what the hell does that even mean? Because as far as I can tell, it means ""do more work without getting any benefit from your employer whatsoever"". It's an insidious way for the corporate culture to encourage wage slaves to put in more effort than ""just enough to not get fired"" without adding any sort of incentive to do so.

It's so insidious that when I said something along these lines to a few of my family members offhand in a discussion, their jaws dropped and they treated me as if I had just said I condone murder or something. We live in a culture where an employer can cut hard-working jobs simply to bolster stock and inflate corporate pay. And you know... that's their right. It's their business, and if they want to run it in as self-serving a manner as possible, well, that's their prerogative. And it should be *your* prerogative too. They want to squeeze every penny out of their workers, then you just go right ahead and squeeze them back as best you can. If they don't care about your hard work, why should you?

A work ethic? What the hell is that? Corporate executives don't have a work ethic. They *certainly* don't have an employer's ethic. To them, it's not about ethics, it's about business. So fuck their work ethic. If it's not something that affects them, it shouldn't be something that affects you either.","1322700114"

"swtor","t5_2qxih","Welcome to the dark side!

I was a priest in WoW from closed alpha through Sunwell Plateau, and I tanked (Paladin, DK, Druid) in WotLK. I was the guy that knew his class inside in out, could recite a talent tree verbatim and read everything and anything about my class and the top players in the world. I'm coming at this from a PVE perspective since I don't PVP. I'm also a 'main tank' or a 'main healer'. I was never second fiddle (not that there's anything wrong with that) so I probably reek of egoism.

If you want to tank endgame content in PVE you need a solid resolve and a moderate ego. I'm not suggesting you become an egoist or just let power go to your head, but you have to accept a ton of responsibility and moreover be ready when 'shit hits the fan'.

I agree with someone's earlier sentiments in that if you want to start a 'new role', now is the time to do it- when the game is still fresh for everyone. That way when/if you screw something up it's entirely plausible that everyone's unfamiliar with the encounter. If you start later on, screw-ups will be much more obvious.

Main tanking (WELL) requires raid awareness unlike any other role. Bad DPS can be carried, it's true- and it happens all the time. Bad healers can be made up for by other healers usually, but it's incredibly obvious if someone else is picking up the slack. A bad main tank is the most obvious thing in the world and WILL bring down your entire raid. A tank that threat-caps his DPS, a tank that stands in the bad stuff, a tank that points the boss at the raid before the cone-AoE- all these things will (without fail) be the end of your raid. To do it right you have to know the boss's abilities- all of them, how they affect you, the raid, the healer, the other healer, the adds, the boss, the DPS standing just a bit too close, the DPS too far away, the guy that looks like he's afk, the off-tank... etc. If someone dies you need to be able to know why, who was responsible (DPS stands in fire- they're responsible. Healer is asleep- healer is responsible. DPS threat-capped and pulled aggro- you're both responsible.)

I loved tanking, I'm a very (charismatic) alpha personality though and it's not for everyone. You encounter asshole tanks that think they're the incarnation of god and forget that the healers make what we do possible- don't be that guy. As fun as being the guy responsible for the massive end-game boss is: healing is the most stressful job in any challenging content and you'd be good to remember that.

I got off point. TL;DR - tanking is fun, if you can handle the responsibility and if you're a good person. If not, you'll probably not make a great tank. :)

Best of luck!","1322700116"

It still leaves 65% of the country below the mean mark which is still shocking. A combined income of two people earning the mean wage in the UK would be more than 40K.

This is using equivalised income, which is necessary for comparison between households.

2. If god can create a stone that he cannot lift, then he is not omnipotent.        

3. If god cannot create a stone that he cannot lift, then he is not omnipotent.    

4. Therefore, by definition, god is not omnipotent.          

THE PARADOX OF OMNISCIENCE:           

1. If God does not know all events past and future then he is not omniscient.         

2. If God does know all events both past and future, then he cannot make any decision or choose a course of action because he already knows his future actions for all eternity. He is paralyzed by his own omniscience.        

3. If God can make a decision or choose a course of action that he did not know in advance, then he is not omniscient.

"lgbt","t5_2qhh7","gay marriage used to be done amongst the igbo people of Nigeria (One of the major ethnicities). Though I think it was specifically woman-woman marriages when one woman had been widowed (If I can find where I originally read this I'll post it). When Nigeria was colonized by the UK the british anti-buggery laws were applied (as with the rest of the colonies). After independence, Nigeria kept this law. 

Northern Nigeria (like 12 provinces) strengthened its anti-homosexuality laws when they were allowed to apply their interpretation of sharia (islamic law), so the death penalty applies there. All of nigeria banned gay marriage in 2006, and now they are doing it again.

The reason they are doubling up the gay marriage ban is to include punishments for people who may not be gay but are for gay rights. Under this new law, advocacy for gay rights is highly illegal, as is ""aiding illegal gay marriages"".

You have beautiful hair.  Not kinda nice, flat out beautiful.  You have great complexion.  I can show you places on the internet where men will worship the way you look.  
  
  
So, from what I gather you just have to start looking at yourself in a positive way.  Real life example, you go to a movie if you think it is going to suck you're going to have a bad time.  But if you go willing to have a good time, even if it is a horrible movie, you can entertain yourself, and have a good time.  
  
You have the ability to make yourself a good time.  Personally, I don't even concentrate on how I look.  I make sure I am presentable but I focus on how I influence other people.  That is what makes me happy.  That is what makes me attractive, imo.  And it enriches my life.

You can offer to help her with the work if there is something that she does not understand, but you are not going to do it for her because it's **wrong.**

She should totally understand when you tell her that it is wrong of you to do her homework for her. If she does not get that... you know there is a serious moral disconnect there. 

Here is the thing about college work, you *have* to keep on top of it, or you end up completely stressing about things and turning in shoddy work that you stay up all night to do at the last minute. Offer to help her organize things. If you need to get her a day planner and see that she enters deadlines from the syllabus, that is what you need to do. 

I simply cannot believe that she just found out about a 5 page paper. When I get an assignment, I have the research done the day after I get it and know exactly what I am going to do. I check the professor websites daily to make sure I am always caught up on my work because I do not like to pull all nighters. 

You could also point out to her that when you are in the military, she is on her own totally. There are going to be times when she cannot reach you for long periods of time and she will have to do it herself.

Agreed, junk. But compared to laptops on that list, the 8440ps are nothing spectacular.

&gt; I don't mean to say that we should be buying more Centrino, but that we shouldn't be buying anything branded i5 or i7.

We want laptops to still be useful after a few years, and that means that when they are brand new, yes, they will seem a little overpowered for the average student's use. There will also be some more CPU/GPU intensive applications deployed soon (e.g. ArcGIS, Mathematica, SPSS, etc.). If we bought $400 laptops, we would be replacing them after a year, tops. The Lenovo T400s are still going strong after almost three, the T61s something like five, and it's because they were quality hardware at the time they were purchased.

&gt;Well, he was the only puppy at the Michigan Humane Society-Detroit shelter when we got him at 9 weeks. As required, they neutered him before being allowed to be adopted, and quickly developed a cold (kennel cough) after coming home. We took him back to the Humane Society, as they ""guarantee"" the health of their adoptions of sorts and care is covered, and got a basic course of antibiotics. He didn't respond, got worse and worse, wouldn't eat/drink anything, and then went back to the clinic on New Year's eve day (This was after the Xmas holiday--maybe rescue the unwanted ""gifts""), and since they were closing early, they just filled his back up with fluids (e.g. camel), and basically said, ""good luck"" and we had to leave. Fun fact: this was the clinic/vet featured on the original Detroit ""Animal Rescue"" show on Animal Planet.
New Year's eve night, he (""Owen"") got worse and worse, started throwing up again, wheezing, and was in shit-shape, so we took him an emergency vet where the guy actually looked at his lungs, saw he pneumonic, and prescribed a different antibiotic/meds. They kept him overnight, he seemed okay and was a little better in the morning, and then I spent the next week squirting water in his mouth, shoving food down his throat, and giving him Keflex (stronger antibiotic). He made a full recovery. Suck it, Dr. Cici.","1322700145"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I think I disagree with all of your premises.  I think that is why you do not understand my point.

The Bible is not the only proof of God's existence.  The Bible is not dictated by God verbatim.  God does not send people to Hell for not believing in him.

The concept of Original Sin is a 2nd century construction based on a few of Paul's writings.  Therefore anything regarding the concept of original sin cannot be an example of the Bible's internal consistency.  Also, the term 'knowledge' here is more of a term of experience, than understanding.

This would be a good argument against a young earth creationist.  But to a Christian like me, who believes in evolution; the seven day creation story is remarkable consistent with chiastic parallelism common in Hebrew poetry styles.  I like Rob Bell's description [here](http://vimeo.com/11692920).  Just watch the first ten minutes.

I don't understand why something cannot be good before it does something bad.  We often consider babies good, regardless of what they become when they grow up.

"statistics","t5_2qhfi","Well, the idea is that it follows exponential decay, but I can't just measure the rate of decay at time t = 0 + dt. The reason being that I have to shut of production of x first by a drug, which a) doesn't have instantaneous effect and b) I don't move so fast as to be able to sample all of my samples in dt time and c) the way x is measured probably wouldn't detect a difference at t = 0 + dt vs. t = 0 anyway (the half-life is on the scale of hours). As such, I figured the best way would be to plot the exponential decay curve, fit it and then compare the fits. So I'm wondering what the best method for doing so is (a.k.a.: should I compare fitted parameters post-fit or compare the curves pre-fit, and which method to use in either case).","1322700166"

Bachmann is seemingly too religious.  I'm a Christian, but when you start saying that you think your Christian values are right for the government regardless of others, that's a bit too far.  Other than that she's good enough for me.

Yes lets look at Medicare. An unfunded liability of nearly $25 trillion over the lifetime of those now in the program. Oh and that [25T](http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-06-06-us-debt-chart-medicare-social-security_n.htm) is likely an underestimate, Medicare's actuaries say, because it counts on 165 cost-saving changes in the health care reform law. Many of these are unlikely to occur — such as cutting physician payments 30% by 2012

So Medicare is straight fucked

&gt;subsidized student loans

Yes look how well those have helped out. Massive increase in education costs due to gov back loans. That will be the next bubble to burst.

&gt;national security

Ok taxes here are appropriate, however we are spending a ridiculous amount and we should be spending on DEFENSE not bases all over the world.

&gt;police and fire services

Should be locally funded or volunteer

&gt;public schools

Should be paid for by parents

&gt;roads

Gas taxes pay for these or the local authority can do a bond if the community feels a new one is needed. Also private/toll roads would be good. 

&gt;consumer product testing

Should in no way be government funded. We don't need a government consumer reports or UL.

&gt;clean water

Should be privatized or locally provided

&gt;parks

eh could go either way. I would almost prefer a private party to be responsible.

&gt;unemployment insurance (the middle class lose their jobs, too)

I would rather have my cash then doled out via some bureaucracy that eats up most of the money. 6.2% should go back to me and I will save for a rainy day thanks.

&gt;the invasion of Iraq

We should fund wars like we did in WW2 and before with war bonds not deficit spending. That also makes a country much more likely to no go to war.

&gt;bailouts of the financial system

Unacceptable in my book and blatant corporatocracy. They should have failed.

&gt;includes the mortgage interest tax deduction

Should be eliminated

&gt;the 401(k) deduction

Should be eliminated

Taxes should be very very simple

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm normally the first person to object when Catholics wheel out the old ""but everybody was torturing and murdering people in those days"" argument, but why the hell are you trying to impose modern, *progressive* ideas about justice onto an incident from 400 years ago? We still have people in positions of power around the world *today* who lock people up, or even execute them, for the most absurdly trivial reasons, and we've come a looong way since Gallileo's day.

Of course it wouldn't be justified by your or my personal standards today, but you try explaining that to anyone on the planet back then and they'd think you were mad.

We're talking about a time when, for instance, there were only really two forms of medicine for any ailment: 1) leeches, and 2) chop it off. You were considered incredibly old if you reached 40. If you found yourself on the wrong side of someone in authority, justly or otherwise, you could expect to be burned at the stake if they were feeling lenient. 

No, house arrest for having an opinion was never objectively *OK* but it was exceptionally lenient for the times. Arguing for better treatment of criminals back then would have been a bit like telling people to go vegan and try to reduce their carbon footprint. Or switch to Linux.

Applying modern ideas about human rights and such to the Church's treatment of Gallileo is similarly anachronistic.","1322700172"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I am the author of the study...

The Montana DOT was the source of the data. We only looked at those roadways where there were no speed limits. The sample is small and the vehicle miles driven went up a little over the 5  years, but not signifcantly.

Bottom line, not a single fatality was attributed to no speed limits and 2 years after the study when there was speed limits the speeds were within one mile per hour at one site where we were able to collect data.

People drive at the speed they are comfortable regardless of the signs. The speeds and accident rates on the interstates didn't change, but two lane roads did. Difference lane courtesy and yielding.

In 2010, after record drops in fatalities nationwide Montana's rate today is still higher than when there were no limits - safest period.

The per 100k comparison doesn't apply, becaiuse roadway design and environment determines fatality rates. Per 100k in New York where few drive or even have license cannot be compared to a state where it may be 60 miles to store in the winter, and you can only get there driving.

Correlation? If speed kills how can the lowest fatality rates recorded in moden times occur when there were no daytime limits; low sample sizes or not.

Another myth seen here in the thread - distracted driving, texting and cellphone use as a major safety problem. http://www.bhspi.org/photos/BHPSI_NHTSA_fars1961-081b.gif 

The data doesn't support that conclusion either, it's a follow the power and money PR program that benefits the regulators and those who profit from these enterprises - citations and premium surcharges is the name of the game.

It's a kind of odd niche that MUC is in.

Bust size: Measure under (or over) the boob around the body. Like measuring the chest. In this case we will be a 34.

Cup size is basically measuring around the body, but including the boobs. Then you take that number, and subtract the bust size from it. (in this case 36). So a 36 - 34 (bust) = 2 = B cup.

Cup sizes are pretty much alphabetical. A (small) --&gt; G (being huge).

Just like batteries where AAA is smaller than AA. Same applies with AA, A sized bras. Howver once you get bigger, the more letters the larger it is. So B &lt; BB &lt; c &lt; d &lt; DD etc

There is variation according to brand, type, and how firm you want to wear it. Also, many women have ill fitting bras.

"linux","t5_2qh1a","I'm a linux/unix admin.  
I **love** my job, I really do.  

Being a linux admin means you get to harvest your personal creativity in your every day work, that's not something all IT jobs can offer.  

I don't know any programming languages but I should probably learn one, I am alright with bash scripts and I haven't had any need to progress this into full programming knowledge.  

My typical day:

* Starts off with making a coffee and then reading through email logs from the servers (we have quite a few), looking for high disk usage moments, security warnings, update notifications etc...  

* From there I move on to the job queue to see if there are any requests from the business such as, add DNS entries, expand storage on servers, update files on a web server etc.. etc.., there isn't usually that much.  

* I then make another coffee and spend a portion of the day researching improvements and technologies that could be seriously implemented that would improve the system, introducing automation etc...  

* I then make another coffee and do a bit of security auditing, running software such as Metasploit / Nessus to pentest servers and look for things that have been misconfiguration or need updating.  

* I then usually make another coffee before having a coffee or perhaps even a cup of matcha tea.  

My advice for starting out is to get your Linux+ or LPIC and that will get you a junior job as a linux sys-admin along with a good attitude and some personal time screwing around with distro's etc...  

After working as a sys-admin for 3 months or so I would go sit your RHCSA and plan to sit your RHCE the next year if you have the $$ (usually the workplace will pay for these anyway, also there should be a pay rise in it for you!).  

Even if you don't use Red Hat in your workplace it is still the best linux cert out there, primary because it's concerned with results - not bullshit multi-choice rubbish (which unfortunately LPIC is).  


Long-story short, **DO IT**. It's a wonderful, enjoyable, challenging job that will surround you with intelligent and hopefully humorous people, if you need any help ask away.  ","1322700181"

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","The problem with your analogy is that you assume that just because you *labeled* the activities, they are some how arbitrary. the problem is, the labels are the only thing arbitrary about it, not the activity itself.

The other problem with your analogy arises when you realize that, as a society, we have deemed most things to be gender-neutral nowadays because of political correctness. If a transgender m2f wanted to play with dolls, they can. But that's NOT what being transgender means. They do not simply want to be able to take part in activities, they identify as a specific gender in their head and it doesn't match their sex. This, besides being the reason gender cannot be explained by your analogy, also explains why transgender people don't simply cross dress. They hate their bodies because their biological sex does not match their mental gender. Gender is a mental construct, not a societal one. It exists as a form of identity regardless of society trying to decide the roles that fit it.

In essence: Sex = physical and biological - we are normally supposed to have a sex that matches our gender. There are deviations due to complications at birth, etc.

gender = mental and biological - our gender is simply the mental catalyst for our physical being. It is supposed to dictate our train of thought to be in line with this physical aspect. Once again, complications and medical conditions render this to sometimes not match with the physical.

gender roles = not biological - what a shit ton of people inaccurately group with gender. Gender *roles* are the only aspect of our identity that is a social construct. Sometimes these roles tend to match our gender, sometimes they don't. Either way, they are created to help us adapt to a world that is constantly changing. While gender dictates our primal ""roles"" gender roles dictate how we adapt our primal roles into modern day settings and often times, they become out dated before they disappear which is why there is always such hooplah about it, especially in the feminist and lgbt communities.","1322700199"

Also, games look like ass when displayed at anything other than their native resolution, early 3D games especially. Unless you've got your PS3 hooked up to some old CRT, the game is going to look like ass on either system. An emulator can upscale, which looks far better than just stretching the image.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","First off, you've got your terms wrong. 

&gt; Assault **Weapon**

Assault weapon is a **non-technical term** referring to any of a broad category of firearms with **certain features, including some semiautomatic rifles, some pistols, and some shotguns.** There are a variety of different statutory definitions of assault weapons in local, state, and federal laws in the United States that define them by a set of **characteristics they possess.**

&gt; Assault **Rifle**

An assault rifle is a selective fire (selectable between semi-auto and fully automatic) rifle (capable of being fired from the shoulder) that uses an intermediate cartridge and a detachable magazine. 

Next, to your questions:

&gt; Do you own any ""assault rifles"" based on the common definition?

I personally own no ""assault rifles"" because they're too damn expensive, however, I own two semi-automatic **only** AR-15s, and have ""in my posession"" just under 100 select fire M16s, a couple hundred select fire M4s, some SAWs, and some M240Bs. Oh, and a hand full of Ma Dueces. But I don't own those, I just possess them. 

&gt; Do you think the ability to own one is critical? 

More critical than the ability to own anything above the cheapest car a company makes. Is it critical to own a Charger when a Neon could get you to work and home? 

&gt; While I don't have a problem with people owning assault rifles, I honestly dont think I would care if they were banned (pending the definition of ""assault rifle""). 

It's easy to not care when things you don't do/care about are banned. 

See [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came%E2%80%A6)

&gt; ""First they came…"" is a famous statement attributed to pastor Martin Niemöller (1892–1984) about the inactivity of German intellectuals following the Nazi rise to power and the purging of their chosen targets, group after group.

You say you and your dad like shooting, but you wouldn't mind if they banned a certain type of firearm. You're going to mind once they ban semi-auto rifles, all handguns, then eventually all centerfire guns. You'll have a bolt action .22LR until that's all people are murdered with, and they ban firearms completely.

Ok, so, now you are browbeating me.  At the beginning, yes, I admit, I was being rash. However, I think I've plead my case reasonably.  

&gt; First, there are real and unreal women. Now, everyone has religion, and it agrees with your religion. The Golden Rule is not a religious teaching, by the way. There's also more than one Golden Rule.

I was using real figuratively.  As in ""common"".

Also, um, how does the golden rule of mathematics apply here?  Are you being obtuse just to be combative?

&gt; People are allowed to have opinions. Opinions are just that, and some of them are come by through feelings rather than logic. One person may have a natural preference for chocolate, another for strawberry. Neither of those is wrong. It may be in bad taste to voice them, but there isn't really any way to stop that and have an open forum at the same time.

No kidding.  Are you going to tell me about a thing called the 1st Amendment, too?  I'm arguing from an ethical stand point.  Just because a person has a *right* to do something, or *can* do something doesn't mean they should from an ethical standpoint.  For example, I have the right to fart right in your face.  I mean, rip a big, fat, loud, wet one right in your nose.  Should I though?  How would that make you feel?  You'd probably be offended (though, you might be turned on by it, too, which if you are, yikes).  I know that farting in people's faces is offensive because I myself take offense to it, as do most people.  Therefore, I do not do it.

The same goes for ridiculing someone because of how they look.  Do you see what I'm saying?  Sure, people are pointing out that they do not find her attractive.  Which is reasonable.  But others are saying:

&gt; Cows go MOO!

and

&gt; Shamu. You can see her perform at Seaworld daily

These are unacceptable because they are designed to hurt the girl.  I think the fact that they have been downvoted to oblivion kind of proves my point that most people find this behavior unethical.

&gt; It's idiot feminists like you that make me refuse to call myself one. You judge people for making judgments, then sit on some high horse thinking you're better for them for your superior opinions. Oh, someone disagrees with you? They're either ""immature, too literal, illiterate, uneducated, or closed minded"". They're also losers, according to you.

Um, yeah.  I have no patience for closed minded people who ridicule others and refuse to see the other side of the point.  That's my *opinion*.  If *you* perceive me to be high and mighty because of that, then I give you my thanks.

&gt; You seem to want a world free of negativity. Do you know what the result of that is? The result is the culture we're quickly moving toward. The place where everyone gets an award just for showing up. Where there are no winners or losers. Where nobody ever needs to try because they know the outcome and reward will be the same whether or not they do. The kind of culture where laziness is rewarded and trying or succeeding is either met with apathy or punished.

Hmmm, I don't think I want a world full of mediocrity or laziness.  I've seen what happens to a generation when everyone gets an award for playing soccer, win or loose.  But I see a world of difference between being hurtful to someone and being constructive.  I like constructive criticism.  Telling a girl who is healthy that she is ""too fat"" or that she is ""Shamu"" is being hurtful.

&gt; This is the kind of place where a smart kid who tries very hard gets put down for making the other kids feel bad. Where do you think that's going to lead us as a society? I guarantee you that the Nirvana you're hoping for is not a place you'd care to live in.

You know, you are right on this point.  I'd love to live in a world where people constantly berate each other.  That sounds like a dandy of a time.

Now, if you excuse me, reading your post made me want to take a massive dump.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Simple: you need FlexibleContexts whenever you want to mention something *that isn't a type variable* in a constraint. Consider:

    f :: (Foo a) =&gt; ...
    f = ...

The constraint only mentions the type variable `a` - this is a restriction in H98/H2010: constraints can only mention type variables, and not actual types.

FlexibleContexts allows you to mention things that *aren't* type variables in a constraint. So you can say this, now:

    g :: (Foo [a]) =&gt; ...
    g = ...

Or:

    h :: (Bar a ()) =&gt; ...
    h = ...

`[]` is not a type variable, it is a type constructor. `()` is also not a type variable - it is a type itself. So you need flexible contexts in order to mention them inside a constraint.","1322700233"

As far as just eating dogs or cats go, if they're raised as livestock, I would (and have) eat them. In some countries, raising large livestock (such as cattle) is economically and ecologically impossible, so smaller animals fill the need.

I don't agree with the abuse of any animal, but I know that slaughtering an animal is not abuse. Contrary to what a lot of the ""activists"" state on that Yahoo articles comments, as dumb as a politician can seem, he/she is still smarter than a horse/dog/cat.","1322700245"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I was on a High School bus, sitting in around the middle of the bus. The bus pulled up to the school and opened its doors up for everyone to get off.  I proceeded to get up and wait in line to exit the bus. About three sets from the front of the bus sat shy looking girl. She looked anxious to get out and I assumed she had missed her chance to exit when the bus first stopped because she had to put something away in her book bag. I proceeded to do the nice thing and wait for her to exit in front of me. A few years later, a mutual friend of ours introduces us. We had both forgot about this incident a few years back. In 11th grade, we started dating. At some point in our relationship, we remembered this story and realized that was the first moment we had met each other years ago. We are still happily dating to this day. 

Tl;dr I let a girl go in front of me. A few years later we started dating.
