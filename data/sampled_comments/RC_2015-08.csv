"LifeProTips","t5_2s5oq","This would not work with the company that I work for or several other large groups as far as I know. 

Most rents are set by a third party company that uses market value of the apartment along with historical data as a means to control the rental amounts. We are not able to change the amounts that are given to residents. However, there is a wide fluctuation in pricing based on lease duration. Longest lease is not always the best price. 

You're also going to have to worry about state and local law in regards to this. Haggling is a potentially major fair housing issue. This isn't to say that I haven't been told that it's allowed, but of the 100+ properties I've helped at only one property did it. 

Edit: To add context to the 100+ communities. I worked for a staffing agency that was specific to apartments. I moved from community to community as was needed. I changed hands so often and so frequently that there were weeks where I would be helping at 5-6 properties at a time. ","1438387201"

"240sx","t5_2sqch","I had the chance to ride them in my friend's S14 and they're pleasant on SOME roads--if you drive in a city with mostly shitty roads, you'll hate your purchase. The high spring rates were valved appropriately and if your car is on the ground with some room for some wheel/shock travel, you'll definitely will be getting the most from these.

The mindset that you want to come into when buying a set is that ""my car is going to be purposely low, not super functional, but I'll make the necessary things to make space and/or make these ride decently""

The reason why I say ""or"" is because not very many people go as far as to modify their suspension bits to accommodate for the really low ride height.

The wheel well factor is really more so for 13's than 14's but either way, making room is always necessary if your goal is to have wide wheels with negative offsets which is right up 326's style. Hard to tell with only your handy dandy butt dyno but these dampers do compress and expand. Give them room to do so and you'll have yourself a OTS-slammed-ready coilover set that will need supporting mods to mate them on a relatively functional purpose.","1438387201"

Engorged areas feel better when touched, caressed, and penetrated.

If this isn't an option for you, I suggest you seek out a woman in your church who has a marriage you want to emulate and ask her out for coffee. Be honest and tell her what is going on.

They do it against stop CPUs so that lag and other player inputs get in the way. It's not like a montage video of SIQ TREINAN MOAD COMBOZ is making the rounds or anything, they're literally just a demonstration so others can apply it to their gameplay. 90% of competitive smash is labbing and part of that includes fucking around in training mode for a few hours to get the feel of your character before applying what you learned to human opponents.

I believe in social healthcare, and part of what I mentioned was subsidized gym membership. I'm far from some right wing nut bar. I just believe if we're charging people more for motorcycle insurance because it's dangerous, shouldn't unfit people pay a bigger premium too, if they can reasonably become healthy? 

I'm not saying charge people for having diabetes. If a health condition is out of their control then that's cruel to punish them for it. I'm saying give them incentive not to get to that point. Give them tax breaks for hitting the gym, and lower their insurance premiums if they stay healthy. 

We reward safe driving with lower premiums where I'm from. Why aren't we rewarding healthy behavior?

Or tax shitty food more, maybe? There's no reason we couldn't add a 5% fast food tax. Give Incentive for companies to offer healthy foods, or reduce crappy foods from their menu, and use the tax money to fund health programs in schools.","1438387213"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

"news","t5_2qh3l","That seems a good plan, but that kind of transference of personal liability totally much everything up.

After thinking about this, you have to realize: you can't actually control people. And I mean that literally, you can't control their actions, unless perhaps they have a cybernetic radio control implant in their brain. All you can do is offer them incentives to act in certain ways.

So, still use lawsuits and liability to solve it, but instead of piercing through the organization to the individual, apply corrective pressure to the org. Lawsuits for $500m, for example. The idea is to make it impossibly expensive for these organizations to operate in the way that they do.

Put a budgetary burden on the Police Department that is so big that they simply will not be able to operate. This will cause the impossible proverb to happen: shit will roll up hill. The city will be forced to address the issue. Will they simply shutter the police department wholesale? Will the city itself have to unincorporate to pay out the billions it is on the line for? Will the city try to pass off a tax assessment for the payouts to the residents, so much so that they will simply leave, and the city won't exist anymore?

There are cases of rural police stations and forces being totally dissolved and shut down.

The notion of regulating the behavior of each individual officer is an impossible proposition.","1438387214"

So if instead i set my variable into to row =1 I would have to set up my for loop as for(row = 1; row &lt;= input; row ++) to get the same result.

Add TiDi on top of that and it's definitely not for everyone.

While EVE is good at being a social MMO where player interaction is a must. I bet a lot of people do not want to rely on other people, especially those first few months. Flying tackle is not for everyone.

As far as credit score goes, closing an account can only hurt you because it will increase your utilization (if you carry a balance on any of them, which you do) and decrease your number of open accounts (more accounts is better for score).  You can not benefit from increased AAoA (as explained above).

"ketogains","t5_2v5mu","I experimented with TKD for 6 months, trying different approaches for approx 2 months.

First was 20-30g dexteose pre workout. Mixed results as far as energy, BUT undeniably hit higher intensity in my programming despite not ""feeling it"".

Then did 20-30g dextrose post workout. Seemed to give me more stable energy levels in general - nice flat ""plateau"" of energy in and out of gym. Maintained intensity of TKD but felt better.

Finally did 20-30 g dex both pre and post workout (40-60g total workout days). Actually lead me to feeling energy peaks/valleys. I believe too much carbs for me and did not benefit my workouts more than my previous TKD variants.

Overall, found TKD post workout most useful for me. Speaking anecdotally I believe it simply replenished my glycogen more effectively for the NEXT workout and helped with post gym recovery.

I can only speak to my own experiences.
 
For clarity: this was training as a competing powerlifter, 5 days a week on a GZCL variant of high intensity, undulating volume, 4 week micro cycles.","1438387221"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","Oil is a significant factor, but there are also other things that compound the issue. This is what the Bank of Canada says about it in [its last report](http://www.bankofcanada.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mpr-summary-2015-07-15.pdf): 

&gt; Global growth faltered in early 2015, principally in the United States and China. Recent indicators suggest a rebound in the U.S. economy in the second half of this year, and growth is expected to be solid through the projection. In contrast, **China is slowing amid an ongoing process of rebalancing to a more sustainable growth path. This has pulled down prices of certain commodities that are important to Canada’s exports.** Financial conditions in major economies remain very accommodative and continue to provide much needed support to economic activity. Global growth is expected to strengthen over the second half of 2015, averaging about 3 per cent for the year, and accelerate to around 3 1/2 per cent in 2016 and 2017.

&gt; The Bank’s estimate of growth in Canada in 2015 has been marked down considerably from its April projection. **The downward revision reflects further downgrades of business investment plans in the energy sector, as well as weaker-than-expected exports of non-energy commodities and non-commodities**. Real GDP is now projected to have contracted modestly in the first half of the year, resulting in higher excess capacity and additional downward pressure on inflation. ","1438387223"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Hold up, I very much did read the entire article, and my aim was not to criticize an ""abuse of science"".  Sorry, I'm not that SJW.  The history of psychology being considered a pseudoscience by other sciences is a long one, and not actually my battle or my favorite accusation.  I deeply appreciate psychology and the difficult ground it occupies, and tried to make that clear with my bit about not expecting to have psychology explained in terms of chemistry.  My father in law is a PhD in psychology, and has practiced counseling for decades, and it's difficult ground.

My point is that we do need to be extremely careful in these matters, because people's lives are at risk.  We need to be wary and skeptical of our assumptions.  EG, look at the amount of PTSD and brain damage that happened because of WW2, that went largely misunderstood at the time, in large part because it was so common that people took it for granted that people coming back from war were the way they were.  We can see looking back that it had incalculably vast impact on our society, and we understand something of the root mechanisms now that was not understood at the time.  Now what of religion, and people's behavior within it?  I honestly think that people go slightly crazy when their lives conflict with basic instinctual behavior patterns that are a fundamental part of our species.  I suspect that religion sometimes supplies that conflict, especially when it comes to sexuality and denial of sexuality.  I suspect a lot of the more subtle disorders in the DSM are likewise connected to the society being unsuited to the primate that created it.  It's hard to say.

I think a useful explanatory approach to religion in psychology is to think about it in terms of people believing in and living out a fairy tale fantasy, reacting to their own imaginations, often in complex group delusions full of deeply acting social pressures to fit in.  I think that kind of framework could provide better insight than the approach taken in the article you linked, and that's why I'm particularly skeptical of accepting anything about ""spiritual condition"".  We might just as easily accept that someone's magical potency is low that day, and that's why they are down, and the only difference is that more people seem to believe the Jesus fairy tale as literally true than those that believe the Harry Potter books.","1438387225"

That's when the dark times started. War was waged between Hogwarts and Middle Earth over land and resources. Hogwarts, being the small group of wizards that it is, call upon its ally Wonderland for help. Wonderland helps to combat the Orcs for land. After that, Sir Topham Hatt of Sodor was assassinated by Ghirahim, who was trying to betray Hyrule because he is evil or something. The trains of Sodor declare war on Hyrule for the assassination of their beloved railway manager. The Hyruleans are confused because nobody of their ranks tried to attack any other foreign lands. Brutal combat begins against Hyrule and Sodor over the misunderstanding of the assassination. In the wake of the chaos, Terabithia builds a bridge to Sodor in order to reconquer some land that was taken in the Train/Ogre wars. Sodor catches the Terabithians before any additional damage could be done and more combat ensues. Overwhelmed by numbers, Sodor calls upon its ally, Wonderland, for assistance. As you may remember, Wonderland is a little busy with Hogwarts, so they agree to help Sodor if Sodor helps them against Middle Earth. Once this deal is closed, the catastrophic World War 27.31 begins. Most of the other nations, like Dinotopia and Lilliput, pick a side of the war. However, the small third-world nation of Where the Wild Things Are decided to remain neutral, knowing that their forces were no match for anybody else. Weeks, months, years go by. The war ends with the utter destruction of all of the lands, with only Where the Wild Things Are remaining. But, wouldn't you know it, the Mushroom Kingdom and Latveria emerge from the ashes to plunder what is left of the fallen nations. Being the kind souls that they are, Where the Wild Things Are decided to oppose the imperialist nations who come forward despite their weak armies, but that's a story for another day.","1438387226"

But I can say this: Your parents are wrong about saying you're not pretty. You don't have to wear dresses to look good, if they don't make you feel good. The best look on anyone is confidence, and wearing clothes you're not comfortable in is the surest way to hide away that confidence. If you feel like make-up isn't going to enhance your appearance and confidence, don't wear it. If you try it and it turns out you do enjoy make-up, then wear it for yourself, not to please your parents.

And when you're in college, if you have the freedom and money, buy clothes that make you feel beautiful. Whether that involves dresses or jeans or slacks or skirts or whatever, it should be up to *you.* (and in accordance with laws; don't go to class naked obviously) :P

As for ...

&gt;I want to lose weight and gain muscle

... this will be tricky, it's very hard to have it both at the same time. In order to build muscle you need to eat - you won't build much while on caloric deficit. That's why bodybuilders typically go through 2 phases: bulking (eating a caloric surplus; gaining muscle mass but also some fat) followed by cutting (caloric deficit; losing fat and a bit of muscle, but keeping most of the built muscle mass -&gt; final result being ripped muscular body).

My best advice to you: google ""HIIT"", that's the magic word you're looking for. And combine it with weight lifting. As for eating decide what's your priority. If you're really fat amp up the hiit part but don't expect big biceps. If you're just overweight and can live with that for the time being, keep eating and hit the gym hard, there will be time for cutting (in that case time your cutting phase for next spring so you get ripped as mofo by summer).","1438387229"

Well, sure--but I really don't see how ""regular conversation"" can sustain long-term friendship, in comparison to this system, where the friends are constantly encouraging each other to participate as often as possible (at least once every two days). I'm no good at lying, and also dislike it--I'd hate to be forced to say some empty phrase like ""What's up?"" literally dozens or hundreds of times over the course of a relationship with someone when I didn't actually care.

&gt; I mean shit, basically like this

But didn't I just ask a question? ""Well, then, how do *you* converse with *your* friends?"" And that was in itself precipitated by an observation on your part.

&gt; ""Friend Six"" is a girl, right? Try not to screw that one up, she's a keeper.

Romance isn't really in my plans, given the limited nature of these friendships (both parties will eventually run out of interesting questions to ask; at 700 \[about 350 each\], I feel we're already pushing the limit)--and she's already involved with someone else anyway.

If you start the stage with half HP you can only lose 29% of that half HP before losing medals.  Basically you have less HP you can lose before you start losing medals.

What /u/oscredwin is saying is that if the game sees you have low HP when you start a stage it locks in those values for the rest of the stage.

Even though it might seem to level rather slowly, it's really not too bad. I've turned vampire yesterday and am currently up to level 4 by questing (which involves killing). Saying that, I am VR4. Not sure if that makes a huge difference (I think it might, which makes it a bit more difficult to level quickly at level 10). 

As for your money problem, I simply quested, looted all the bodies, collected resources (better to deconstruct found gear and use resources to craft for i.e. daily crafting writs, but if you need the money - sell it) and never had any problems concering gold. You could also try out your luck by either gathering as many runes (the blue, red or yellow triangles in the world) as humanly possible and hope for a legendary (Kuta) rune or fish and then 'Use' the fish (right click) for a chance of finding a 'Perfect Roe' (worth around 15k-17k), which will get you your mount in no-time. Once again, this is more of gamble, it could either waste your time or turn out to be very lucrative.

a) The Arts and Humanity Research Council is one of the biggest sponsors of research in the UK - are all works which were done due to their sponsorship fake?

b) All this fellow is saying is that some (imho: most if not all) of us like to assume a outsider position when it comes to polticial, social or religious positions. The internet gave this myriads of nutjobs places to find common views and similary spirited people which serves as an encouraging factor to their views. 

In some cases (many actually) the argument is reduced to an dogmatic friend/enemy positioning combined with an rethoric which makes it impossible to reconcile. 

Take a look around reddit and you will find the opinions that e.g. ""the world goverment"" is controlled by feminists, templars, illuminati, jews, americans, aliens. Not all of this opinions are true but yet the have some common rethorics and stem from common fears. 
 
If we take on 9/11:
&gt;“For example take 9/11 conspiracy theorists. Why do they hold onto their conspiracy theory despite the fact that there seems to be overwhelming evidence that it wasn’t an American government conspiracy to bring down the towers?

What if the  answer is simply: Because the story fits the fears and opinions some many hold towards the government?  And while 9/11 conspiracy theories are far more widespread than other conspiracy theories you still fight an uphill battle against public opinion - except when you are in a group which believes in a similar opinion. That's why groups/toughs cluster and  a small group with an extreme believe is bound to hold dogmatic positions.. ","1438387241"

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","Summary of what is relevant for muscle building: 

'Supplementation with the branched chain amino acids, isoleucine and leucine, caused a reduction in serum levels of this growth factor, while the aromatic amino acids, phenylalanine and histidine, increased IGF-1 levels. Milk contains greater amounts of phenylalanine and lower quantities of isoleucine compared to meat products such as beef and chicken (Sosulski and Imafidon, 1990). The amino acid profile of milk may therefore be more conducive to supporting a rise in circulating IGF-1 levels.'

In other words, dairy protein increases IGF-1 levels but meat doesn't necessarily do so. Availability of IGF-1 promotes skeletal muscle cell proliferation and differentiation because IGF-1 signalling  essentially stops inhibition of the mechanistic target of ramapycin complex 1-neural pathway, which is the body's main regulator of tissue growth from nutrients. In other words, dairy protein might promote muscle tissue growth to a greater extent than meat protein does, relatively to cellular energy (ATP) input.

You see what you want to see. We know for a fact that he had a suspended license, that he knew he was supposed to have a license plate on the front of the vehicle, and that the car wasn't his. We can then look at his behavior knowing that information and conclude that he was being intentionally deceptive. Why? Because he had a suspended license and didn't want to go to jail. That's why he lied and that's why he fled.

&gt; well, in this case, I'm going say you are wrong.

You can say whatever you want, that doesn't mean what you say is correct. You see a cop who repeatedly asks a question that was ""obviously answered"" yet you pretend that Dubose didn't tell the officer _twice_ that he _did_ have his license on him.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","no worries!  I'm fine with questions as long as they're in good faith!

I'm good with kissing and some touchin', so my role would be fairly minor, but if it would make him (or the partner) feel better, I could show up and give my blessing, maybe get the ball rolling by kissing him/her/both of them, and then probably bow out as non-awkwardly as possible, perhaps with a fond boop on the nose of farewell.  Then I guess I'd read a book for a while until they finished (idk, whatever one does when being willingly sexiled?), maybe sneak in for some cuddles afterward.  Cuddles are my jam, and there is nothing better than a cuddle sandwich.

I wouldn't really get anything out of this sexually, but I really enjoy emotional/sensual intimacy, so I'd like getting some kisses, and really, I'd more just like to reinforce to my boyfriend that this is 100% okay and that I love him.  The biggest thing is me knowing he's being taken care of, and that everyone's happy.  That would make me feel really good.  But it's not strictly necessary.  As long as I'd gotten to meet/talk to everyone beforehand, I'd be fine with it.  

I hope this answers your question.  I tried to be direct without being super TMI about things, but feel free to ask me anything else :)

"WorldofTanks","t5_2s113","I've played most artillery lines somewhat, though not all the way to 10.

American Artillery is solid all the way through the line, and keeps getting better up to the M53/M55.  I haven't tried the T92, but I hear it's worse.  The main reason these are good is that they have good gun traverse and so need to rotate the hull rarely while still having fairly large guns.  This makes it a lot easier to track moving targets.

French SPGs are fairly mobile, especially compared to other nations SPGs. The lower tier ones have relatively flat trajectories (buildings/obstacles get in the way more, but lower shell travel time so easier to hit moving targets), not sure about higher tier as I haven't played them yet.  The higher tier ones have smaller guns than some of the other nations, but the tier 9 and 10 have full turrets, and the tier 10 has an autoloader which is interesting.

British SPGs are a bit strange at tier 5/6 with very high shell arc so you can shoot over obstacles, but limited range so they need to move a lot.  They shoot quickly, and the FV304 is quite a bit of fun.  Tier 7 to 10 are more conventional SPGs, with tier 10 having the very good gun arc as well, being able to hit people in a lot of places they think they are arty safe.

German SPGs are interesting.  The lower tier ones are fairly accurate and mobile (tier 5/6/7), with the Grille and GW Panther being often regarded as the best SPGs in their tier.  These low tier ones have decent gun traverse and accuracy.  The tier 8/9/10 move to being much slower, with extremely limited gun traverse meaning you have to rotate your hull a lot and get huge reticle bloom.  They do have huge guns though, and are pretty good for doing the arty missions to hit multiple targets in one shot.

Haven't played the russians at all myself, though I gather the S-51 is similar to the high tier german artillery, and the tier 10 russian is quite different with good accuracy (a lot of people use the AP shell on it).

If you're just starting playing artillery, I recommend you get the Battle Assistant mod if you don't have it already. It gives a much nicer view for targeting/making hard shots, though I find the normal overhead arty view is better for acquiring targets.","1438387247"

"OCADsupportgroup","t5_39d7q","I understand why you think this is a bad idea, and I am aware that faculty have it rough sometimes. I don't want this to be a place to rip on faculty and degrade them, this is a place to discuss real problems people are having, such as the things that go on in the registrar office, or counsellors, or sometimes faculty caused issues that some people are having. I don't want this place to become a hate group towards certain faculty, and I want to encourage people to not to name names, I will have to figure out moderation for that behaviour. I am serious about this group, and I want it to be a place people can turn to for advice on dealing with policy, access resources that the OCAD site often makes it hard to find, and be supportive of students dealing with unfortunate things that are not always their fault. I have often thought about joining student union to help with these things, but I unfortunately do not have the time required to devote to that.

As to actually doing something about our complaints, I want to help others who don't know about the policies to read or faculty to contact about situations to be able to have access to those through crowdsourced advice from others who've been through a similar situation. I understand that you feel the students are ""entitled"" and want to ""coddle each other in [their] first world problems"" but that is not the atmosphere I want to see here. I personally went through an experience where I was a guinea pig for a program and often thrown aside in decision making processes focused around ""listening to the students"" and have heard some very major issues from friends and colleagues. I am not talking about petty issues here, this is not going to be a ""circle-jerk"" about what's wrong with OCAD. 


One of my main issues is that people are often afraid to speak out about certain things that happened to them at OCAD because they don't want their name associated to this complaint. I've heard numerous times that people don't want to speak out about OCAD because if people view OCAD badly, they feel their degree will be devalued. My experience at OCAD was not entirely bad, but it was very exhausting and I wish I had the resources to discuss my issues in an open forum like this. 

So instead of sitting here complaining like I usually do, I've decided to do something about it, and create this space where I can help others, with the time that I can afford.

Thanks for your comment, I hope you stick around to help out :)","1438387247"

I spent the allotted time that the tournament gave me searching through the huge piles of leaves that were raked off of the fairway but had no luck. I just assumed someone else would find it and get a free disc out of it and I would never see it again. Anyway, flash forward almost 8 months to the day and I recieved a phone call about my disc, someone had found in on the same course that I lost it on, on the same hole buried under 3 inches of leaves. I'm still in shock that no one had found it before now and that anyone even bothered to call. I told the guy to keep it and enjoy it, after some persuasion on my end he finally agreed to keep and said he was going to give it to his son. This community always surprises me and I was glad that I finally got to pay it forward to a fellow Golfer. ","1438387251"

The end goal I'm trying to achieve is to have a prepared food stockpile that's sectioned off and closer to the dining hall than unprepared food.

He doesn't want anything to do with you at the moment.  That may not hold true for the next 18 years -- and he could possibly decide to seek custody, specifically to cause you distress.

And Chris Holdsworth, should he ever get past his concussion woes, is also an interesting (and young) addition to the division.

Bantamweight is kind of lacking at the moment, it's true. But all of these guys can help breath some new life into the division, and hopefully some of them may even give TJ a good run for his money (but probably not).","1438387256"

"AskScienceFiction","t5_2slu2","You've got it right on the second question. The prime material plane is our plane. Connected to that are the elemental, energy, and alignment planes, as well as the near planes like shadow, spectral, etc. All of these planes together make up a single world. The planes are usually considered power poles for their representative alignment, energy, etc, but planes lore is confusing.

The next level up is not well-explored in the D&amp;D canon, mostly because it isn't really relevant. There are a number of worlds with populations, and these worlds also have their own planes. Collectively, these worlds make up the Universe.

If you go up one more level, you have the multiverse. That is, multiple universes that share similar features but do not necessarily interact with each other. Each universe in the multiverse would have its own set of worlds which have their own planes. Most of the time, they will be near mirrors of each other, with minor differences.

It is important to note that Universes do not interact the same way the planes do. The other planes are all tied together pretty tightly through the Prime Material plane. Energy seems to pass almost freely between them, which is why mages and many creatures can open rifts and portals to move between them.

Universes, on the other hand, do not seem to interact directly at all. Or rather, if they do it isn't through the dimensions we understand as such. It would take an unprecedented amount of energy and effort to make that move, if a mage could even figure it out.

In D&amp;D terms, think of it like this: We're both DM'ing the same Forgotten Realms module. The worlds are nearly identical, but we each have different players, so there will be differences. We are a multiverse. However, a DM could incorporate this multiverse concept into their own game, and things would get crazy.","1438387256"

May I suggest that the moment you start talking about the borders and grievances then everything will lock down just it has for the last hundred years or so.

Palestine could be the same. The Palestinians I have done business with in my country are amazing, hard working, entrepreneurial, creative.

That study they did in Canada suggested that more kids finished school and got the medical care they needed, and single mothers quit their jobs to stay home with the kids, so that's positive. As for entrepreneurs; I can imagine it having some what of a positive impact for them... but I don't really care if it does or not. Whether something affects businesspeople is not really my concern.

&gt;Is there a way to ease the transformation?

I'll defer to Engels here...

&gt;Will the peaceful abolition of private property be possible?

&gt;It would be desirable if this could happen, and the communists would certainly be the last to oppose it. Communists know only too well that all conspiracies are not only useless, but even harmful. They know all too well that revolutions are not made intentionally and arbitrarily, but that, everywhere and always, they have been the necessary consequence of conditions which were wholly independent of the will and direction of individual parties and entire classes.

&gt;But they also see that the development of the proletariat in nearly all civilized countries has been violently suppressed, and that in this way the opponents of communism have been working toward a revolution with all their strength. If the oppressed proletariat is finally driven to revolution, then we communists will defend the interests of the proletarians with deeds as we now defend them with words.","1438387256"

He then told me to send him a trade offer and he gave me his trade offer link. When I clicked it something started downloading and it went quickly before I could stop it my screen turned black. I restarted my computer and everything seemed fine i deleted what downloading and it was done. Later i realized he had stole $80 worth of CS:GO items. I WAS PISSED! but I got over it. Then I stopped playing for a little while. Later I wanted to pay so I played 1 CS:GO competitive game then my friend wanted me to play with them and when we found a game and pressed accept and it said i was VAC banned but I was never hacking!
What I Think Happened I think that he was playing on my account with hacks to boost his friends cause I had randoms on my friends list but I didn't pay them any mind. what I Did I contacted steam support and asked if they could lift it and i gave them the whole story.

Came for Bernie.  Aim to stick around for the duration.  May get slightly side tracked when the election writ is called here in Canada this weekend but this is important to Canadians too.  I consider this to be a pivotal moment in history, there is a lot at stake.

Getting out the vote, particularly with young voters who don't or haven't voted will be key in both places.  Apathy is a big problem when people don't feel that what they do matters.  It matters.

The status quo has a vested interest in promoting apathy, particularly in places where high voter turnout might mean a growing base of support for a candidate like Bernie.","1438387259"

She sounds great. You sound pretty OK. The kissing was cheating but your relationship was at the breaking point and if it had not been that, it would have been something else because a person's heart can only take so much strain. 

The best move would be to completely acknowledge the fault for the event, tell your girlfriend that it was totally your fault and that you do not hold it against her at all and you hope she can forgive you for being a douche-bag, and then move on with a renewed relationship.

If you get over it while she still feels guilty, the event will still fester in your relationship like a piece of rotting meat under the couch. Own it. Call it yours. Free her from the guilt. Only then can you get the effects of the event out of your relationship.

Or dump the girl.

"RocketLeague","t5_30cz1","&gt;Hopefully, if one player pitches a forfeit, and his partner refuses, that initial player gets booted and recorded as a quit penalty... I worry that players would otherwise just grief their partners.

But that gives the other player the authority to kick someone from the game AND give them a quitting penalty. That's worse than griefing.

1. buy another router, and use it to VPN (you'd have to disable the NAT features in either your new router or your bell one).  I would put this as moderate difficulty, so unless you know some networking basics you may want to skip this.

2. Use a DNS-based solution.  I assume you're trying to get US netflix or other streaming services to work.  You don't have to use a VPN to achieve that, you can also use a paid DNS solution.  go to www.unblock-us.com.  they will give you a week free to try the service, and you can configure any device that can use a custom DNS (PS3 included).  device setup details can be found here:

"stobuilds","t5_2uv5z","I like [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/3cibul/videotutorial_eps_the_secret_to_dps_xpost_from/csw864d) as a conjecture for what might be going on beneath the hood.

The idea is there isn't a literal reserve bucket, but a virtual reserve bucket, represented by a function of PowTransRate and firing cycle time  - energy weapons drain WepPow (at the beginning of a weapons cycle), but during the duration of that weapons cycle, you have an opportunity to recover WepPow out of your virtual reserve bucket according to your PowTransRate (EPS). At sufficiently high PowTransRates, you can recover *all* (or close to all) the WepPow drained, keeping your WepPow as close to your max (125 in most circumstances; higher if you're running OSS or another MaxCap breaking console) as possible.

Since beams have the longest firing cycles among energy weapons, they play best with this mechanic (you have more time to recover the WepPow drain between firing cycles; the virtual reserve bucket gets bigger; however the hell this arcane magic works).

But this model doesn't really work either...as explained in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/sto/comments/3cibul/videotutorial_eps_the_secret_to_dps_xpost_from/csvyg6f).","1438387268"

Ok - So I called the local police station (non-emergency line) and informed them about the situation and told the operator I want to remain anonymous. She was completely fine with it. Questions asked during the call were about the duration of the car being in the complex? when did I notice the changes? Is there any city/state name on the decals? 

Two squad cars show up in less than 10 minutes and begin inspection, peeping inside, taking pictures and research on the owner. Shortly after that they knock on the owners door and discuss for few minutes. The owner goes to his apartment and brings out some papers and the cops leave after verifying the papers. I called the station back and found out the guy is actually a cop in another city. Outcome: good to know a cop lives in my building.

"classicalguitar","t5_2sij1","The way I've solved a lot of my left hand issues is just focusing on relaxing my hand and making it feel as easy as possible. My general issue is that I would press too hard (and sometimes still do, though to be honest actually a lot of the issues in Grand Overture  are my right hand - the fugue/allegro of the PFA give me more LH issues). It sounds silly but I played in front of a mirror a lot and I imagined how it would feel like if someone like John Williams or Barrueco was playing the passage, and how easy it would feel/look.

The only other things I can recommend to freshen things up is doing more score study. Once I find something cool in the music (whether or not it's a ""holy shit this chord is built with only fourths"" or ""wow there's really another subject hidden in this fugue I've never seen before"") I usually feel re-invigorated. Additionally, you can get a little burnt out sometimes, and instead of traditional practice score study can give you a break and give you more information to work with when you go back the next day.

I don't know if this helps, you may have done all of these things already, but I just feel that it's important that guitarists approach difficult passages by making them feel and look easy to play. I often see a lot of guitarists ""buckle down"" for a hard part and then fuck it up because they not only add a bunch of tension but are putting was in reality is probably a small excerpt on a pedestal. I am definitely guilty of doing it occasionally (usually, parts that are technically just fine, but I have it in my head that they're hard as fuck), and maybe this advice could help you as well.

I don't think there's much else you can do besides hope that a workshop subreddit sprouts up and becomes big, but for the time being this subreddit + the workshop itself is all you really have. it's nice that you only do it for items that you actually want feedback on rather than just spam submitting everything you've ever made onto here, and as long as it's not against the rules, then go for it, I'm sure I'm part of the minority in thinking that they're annoying, and people like you definitely deserve recognition for the hard work they put into all these skins.

It is pretty amazing how much traffic this subreddit gets. 2 of my videos have never been posted anywhere but on here and have gotten 80k/100k views so I can definitely see why it's tempting to post here.

I also think it's fair to say that not everyone posts their skins on here with the intent of getting feedback, and I'm sure plenty just do it to get more views on their item. you're most likely part of the minority in actually wanting feedback I believe.","1438387270"

The light patina of light rust coloration (in the parlance of our times) doesn't seem to have affected it much, and so far it's digested every factory, re-man, and handload round I have found, in both .357 and .38.

I'm mostly interested in a format which promotes a large variety of play style and decks. Reducing that variety is bad, even before things reach a 1-deck format. Legacy in 2011 had a lot of variety. It even had a tier-1 blue deck *without* Brainstorm (Merfolk). 2015 Legacy has about 5 different flavors of Delver. Conceptually, the strategic space has constricted.

Lil B began by saying that although he was a fan of Budden, he felt disrespected by comments Joe made on Twitter. The beef escalated when B released ""T-Shirts and Buddens"" and Tweeted, ""WHO WANTS TO BE MY NEXT VICTEM IN RAP NO 1 IN THE GAME CAN FUK WITH ME WESTCOAST, DOWNSOUTH ,EASTCOAST, MIDWEST BAY AREA IM GOD OF RAP.""

He later added another Tweet, ""ima fan but he was making fun of me on twitter like i cudnt rap lol.""

However, he seemed to have a change of heart later, when he decided to apologize, calling Budden a true legend.

As you can see, Budden didn’t really get a chance to respond. Though Joe said his diss was pretty decent.

The reasons he gave were that slowing down is recommended because it reduces the chance that the animal will smash through the windshield, but swerving is unsafe because you can end up losing control which is much more dangerous than hitting the animal (e.g. ending up in a ditch by rolling).

I've always wondered if this is the attitude everyone has when they drive through land with the risk of large animals - or if it's even good advice - but the guy who said it had a huge beard so I think he must be right.

He didn't say much about smaller animals, but I don't think there are many storks in the outback anyway.","1438387274"

The VS and NC ones have very little distinct noises, the VS one sounds just like a generator or SCU, the NC one sounds similar to that. The standard knife is good in a continuous attack, and by that I mean if the enemy is dead after your first swing, it's better. If you're using the OHK knives, they are much slower, and thus if you miss that first swipe, or for whatever reason that first swipe doesn't kill, then you're in a bad spot. ","1438387274"

Also I have a group of friend but they mainly play LoL and CS:GO so would like some dudes that will play some chill Minecraft with me. I don't like when people argue so I always will try my best to prevent it. I feel I'm a mature teenager and I would really just like to play factions like the good old days.

He would have been better served to position himself like this:


""I have a lot of respect for Trump, and I have a lot of respect for his supporters. I've been out there at the tea party rallies. Trump is the lightning rod right now and there is some real angst out there about how far our country is off track. People are desperate for someone who can reverse that and, most importantly, GET THE JOB DONE.

I think we've all seen that the establishment isn't going to get us there - in fact they seem to be on a neverending slip in the other direction.  But I don't think it's impossible.  I have a series of plans and proposals to reverse the course of the nation and return us to being the land of freedom and opportunity that we know we can be.
If Trump has a better idea than my Fair &amp; Flat Tax proposal to give a raise to every working American immediately, and drive dollars into our economy, I'd like to know what that is. If Trump has plans for fighting for unborn lives, let's hear them. 

But Trump's supporters are absolutely right - things need to change in this country. I'd like to ask them all to consider the concrete proposals that we're putting out there. We're all about defeating the Washington machine, and restoring faith in the American dream.""


The only way Rand is going to peel supporters away from Trump is to remind them that he's one of them, and the give them a call to action: ""consider my proposals"".  He's need to appeal to their sense of fair play.  Attacking Trump is suicide for Rand. He just makes himself look like part of the establishment that way. Rand wins nothing by insulting the voters and questioning their sincerity. That's for the other guys.

I'm disappointed.  I had thought Rand had this much already worked out.  Now I'm a little worried.","1438387284"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Actually? The first amendment. Court rulings have lifted restrictions on donations, so there's more total money available to fund the campaigns. 

I bet you could do a pretty cool graph comparing length of campaign with rulings lifting or relaxing limits on campaign contributions.

EDIT: I'm gonna regret starting this. But here's a start using only candidates who won the nod, and thus is likely flawed: 

* __1976__ SCOTUS lifts limits on campaign expenditures in __Buckley v. Valeo__
* Reagan announced on November 13, 1979, just under a year before generals.
* __1981__ SCOTUS allows RSCC to make expenditures on behalf of RNC, in __FEC v. DSCC__
* __1984__ SCOTUS lifts limits on independent PACs supporting publicly funded presidential candidates in __FEC v. NCPAC__.
* __1986__ SCOTUS allows non-profits to print pamphlets supporting candidates in __FEC v. MA Citizens for Life.__ 
* Dukakis announced April 29, 1987, just over 18 months before generals.
* Clinton announced October 3, 1991, 13 months before generals.
* Dole announced April 10, 1995, 19 months before generals.
* __1996__ SCOTUS allowed CO Republican Party to run ads opposing likely Democratic Candidate without limits because there was no coordination between the Party and Candidate in __CO Repub. Fed. Campaign Committee v. FEC I__
* W announced in June of 1999, about 17 months early.
* John Kerry announced on September 2, 2003, 14 months early.
* Barack Obama announced in February of 2007, 20 months before the generals.
* __2011 Citizens United__
* Mitt Romney announced his candidacy in early June, 2011.

"dragonage","t5_2r8lo","If you get passives that increase the duration of barrier, spirit blade is *plenty enough* to keep your barrier up, and a lot of people consider spamming spirit blade to be extremely effective. It's even more effective if you add fade cloak, since the cloak absorbs some damage for you and hits quite hard if you upgrade it.

If you are using spirit blade you will want the increased mana regen talent, reduced cooldowns equipment, and reduced cost on your equipment. The latter can be found primarily from rings, amulets, belts, and runes.

In essence, there are two ways to play a KE. At a distance, using it to charge up fire spells with Chaotic Focus, or in close combat using Spirit Blade. 

It is possible to switch between one or the other, but if you spam the hell out of spirit blade you won't have much mana left to cast your fire spells and if you use chaotic focus on your fire spells you won't have barrier up at all times (making close quarters more dangerous).

If you want to have a good jerking off to Kanye's metacritic score go ahead.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","And you've identified what SHOULD drive wage increases:  supply and demand.  If there aren't enough people who are willing to do nursing for the same wage as a burger flipper, the offered wage will go up, just like you said.  

If people willing to be nurses are the proverbial dime a dozen, it won't.  I suspect your scenario will be the more likely case.  In general, this will occur throughout the economy, making $15/hour eventually buy about what minimum wage buys now.  Except in the meantime, people will be pushed into higher tax brackets until the tax code is rewritten to reflect wage inflation.

The employment benefits that are expected now (medical insurance, retirement accounts, etc.) were introduced when supply and demand was artificially removed from wage pricing in WWII.  The government put caps on wages and companies began to offer non-wage compensation to recruit employees and retain the best ones.  

Trying to control market forces doesn't make them go away.  But the problems that arise as the market tries to correct for intervention and attempted control are often worse than the problems those interventions attempt to fix.  There are few problems so bad that government intervention can't make them worse.","1438387294"

He wanted to keep his name on this house in Michigan and not fully hand it over to my brother, although as far as I know, my brother has fully taken over the mortgage, which I don't believe to be true. 

I know he was hiding the fact that he moved down south from the assessor because she was the mother of a friend I went to school with and she asked one day how he was doing, and I told her that he was happy in his new house in South Carolina. I told my dad about this interaction and he got angry with me, telling me that she wasn't supposed to know that he was living down south. Obviously, I know something's up. I guess nothing ever came of it, but I probably wouldn't hear about that, anyway.

"Genealogy","t5_2qmdf","Watch out for what you think you know versus what you can prove. Our memories are faulty so some stories can get mixed up or just confused over time. Write it down then prove the parts of it. Or disprove parts. I've debunked many family stories but I've also proven a couple. One vague story about my mother's maternal aunt that, with her husband, ran a tea house (I found the place and I'm pretty sure it was more than a 'tea house', but I can't prove that.)

Accept skeletons and heroes right along with the farmers who didn't do anything special. They all made choices that led to you. Don't judge them, learn about them. Every decision they made was made based on what was 'normal' at the time. Well, you can judge criminals a little...

Just because you don't find a record doesn't mean the event didn't take place. It just means you didn't find the record, yet. The record might be lost (think most of the 1890 census) or never got recorded properly (think births &amp; deaths prior to about 1885).

Don't just collect names. Many people 'researching' online today are trying to collect the most number of people in their tree (quite a few claim to have 30,000 or more people researched; I still haven't broken 3,000 after almost 25 years). Don't try to prove a connection to royalty or Adam &amp; Eve; most Europeans are eventually related to some royalty because, well, in those days royalty couldn't stay out of bed. And as for Adam &amp; Eve; that's just not possible so don't try.

You will run into brick walls. Some lines just disappear. Don't get upset or frustrated. Back off and follow another line for a while. Sometimes that helps clear your head to look at the problem from a different angle. Sometimes it gives records a chance to be found or scanned. Sometimes it's just the end of the road for that line.

Help others as you go. Every genealogist / family historian has different experiences with different records. You may have solved a puzzle before someone else. I'm still learning new things all the time. And I help others whenever I can (like this post). At least, I hope I'm helping.

Think about each record and how *confident* you are with each piece of information on the record. My paternal grandmother's birth record, which I just found a few weeks ago, says she was born a day later than I thought. That record was written much closer to her actual birth than anything else I've found so I'm trust it a little better than any census.

There are three kinds of evidence: primary, secondary, and well rumor. A primary record, as I'm sure you know, is a document created at the time or very close to the time of the event. A deed or tax bill is a good example of that. A modern birth certificate or death certificate is too. Secondary evidence is a document created later, such as a delayed birth certificate. Everything else, including family stories / oral histories, are rumor until you find something else to corroborate it.

Then there's the ""preponderance of evidence"". If you can't find a definitive document that proves a fact, find lots of secondary evidence that supports it.

One last thing. An 'index' of a record or a transcription of a record is not the record. It's just a hint that the record exists. An index does not prove any fact by itself. Also, watch out for compiled 'records' such as the ""millennium file"". That's just plain dirty data. Use it, if you must, to find hints but never use it to prove a fact. The number of errors in that data is scary.

That's all I can come up with at the moment. I hope this is useful.","1438387298"

Im on long term maintenance because I simply can't stay off dope, but you can do a two week detox and come out of it relatively unscathed. Its important to remember suboxone extremely potent (I think 60x morphine potency) with an absurdly long half life. This means its very easy to end up with way more sub than you need in your body. Use only as much as you need to stay functional,  and then use an exponential decay formula along with liquid titration to wean off it very gradually. If you do it properly and stick to the schedule, you can detox off it with very minor symptoms.

I suggest you try this since you've been doing lope and kratom, which are far inferior detox drugs. People like to say suboxone withdrawal is god awful, but it truly isn't. Being a partial agonist, you never really get any of the more severe withdrawal symptoms. I previously kicked a 2mg/day habit,  which is a rly high dose to jump from, and I never felt anywhere near as bad as heroin withdrawal. ","1438387305"

"Madonna","t5_2qr9l","It seems obvious to me that Gaga was influenced in some ways by Madonna, but in and of itself that's not surprising. I mean, M has been out there blazing the trail that scores of female pop stars are following now, and to deny that fact or try to blur the impact by saying shit like, ""yeah well what about Bette Midler? HUH??"" (sorry, I had an ex who tried to pull that on me and it just made me want to smack him) is insulting and intentionally missing the forest for the trees. Nobody is saying that Madonna did the female singer career first, but almost every instance of one of these women having a successful career pre-80s had a mandatory requirement of a man, or a group of men, calling a lot of the shots (and taking a lot of the profits). That's what gets missed, that M took control of her own trajectory and career path, the way men have been doing for centuries, and it certainly ruffled a lot of feathers.

But it also served as a blueprint for the successive waves of female pop stars in the years since Madonna hit it big. It seems like most of them are aware of Madonna's influence in allowing them to call the shots on their own careers, and Gaga is no exception. I think Gaga borrowed more from Madonna than most of the others, especially in some of the music as well as in her image, but I also think Gaga managed to put her own spin on it enough that it's not really being a copycat. And that most of the 'OMG she's copying Madonna' originated not from fans of one or both singers, but rather by the last remnants of the gossipy tabloid pseudo-journalists who are trying to stir up another catfight to generate clicks to their stupid blogs.

The problem is that conservation of energy and conservation of momentum are inextricably linked; so if you violate the latter, you've also violated the former.

It's because of relativity (either Einstein's or Galilean will do); where energy is conserved in a reference frame and all reference frames. But you can show that if momentum is violated, that even if energy is conserved in one frame of reference; it isn't in all the others, for the same object.

Because if it's true, if we really are that much better without cheating or foul-play, what does it say about the competence and/or work ethic of the people who run the other 31 teams? 

Take all that bad faith and combine it with something that looks, if you come from a perspective of adverse inferences, extremely compromising in deflategate... and what do the Patriots, Belichick &amp; Tom do once they're finally caught? Do they finally show some restraint? Do they accept that the integrity of the league is bigger than themselves? That they're not special. No. They double down. They declare their innocence. They go to war. What to us, as Pats fans/reasonable humans, looks like the noble self-defense of people being witch-hunted, looks to them like the same old pattern of cheating coupled with the arrogant assumption that we can get away with it because some how we're above the rules all the other teams must abide by. 

Somewhere along the line, when Goodell realized that there was no easy way out of this b/c Tom wasn't going to accept any settlement that included missing games, I think he started to realize he could turn this to his advantage. Maybe he realized that the PR moves Kensil had orchestrated had put the rest of the league firmly against the Patriots. That a powerful (dangerously so?) owner could be isolated, could be made to call in all his favors, diminish himself in a personal vendetta to take down Goodell. Maybe Goodell is already lining up allegiances against Kraft in whatever power struggle or legal battle is yet to come. 

You've got to remember that Goodell basically started as an intern -- this is the only company he's ever worked for, and he's basically climbed the ranks by being a shrewd and manipulative bureaucrat. Anyway, I definitely think somewhere along the line, Goodell decided that diminishing Kraft's power as a potentially adverse owner would be a nice side effect of this whole shitshow. ","1438387307"

This is a discussion about the very widespread infatuation of an aspect of Western culture, which is in no small way related to the standing of Western culture on a global scale. Why is it that you consider the influence of African music in Western Rock to be credited to The Beatles? Why is it not credited to African music in general? And more to point is the fact that the influence of African music was very much felt in Western music decades before The Beatles were even asking to hold our hands. Traditional African hymns and songs were hugely influential to the early blues and jazz artists who would go on to set the stage for the music of The Beatles.

It is used to synchronize the behavior of components; each device connect to the clock is triggered to ""step"" by the clock voltage crossing a certain threshold, in a certain direction. You should probably go read some basics about digital circuits.

&gt;  **Police officers may not use deadly force merely to prevent escape in misdemeanor
cases.** The use of deadly force to prevent escape of felony suspects is constitutionally
unreasonable except where the escape presents an immediate risk of death or serious
physical harm to another.

&gt;Where the suspect poses no immediate threat of death or serious physical harm to
others, the harm resulting from failing to apprehend him does not justify the use of
deadly force to do so. If an officer uses unnecessary and/or excessive force, or acts
wantonly and maliciously, he could be found guilty of assault, even of culpable
homicide if he kills the person he is attempting to arrest.

&gt;[...] Self-Defense: A police officer is authorized to use that force reasonably necessary to
protect himself or others from death or serious physical harm at the hands of another. 

&gt; There must be an apprehension of **real or immediate danger** based on an overt
and/or constructive act by another

10 minutes cooldown for the first ability? Imo it should be 3, like timeclickers

I like how there's a more clearly defined spot that you know you're supposed to be in. The goal is to be far enough that you're always able to keep all your crusaders attacking. This is a more visceral approach than ""figure out which level gives you the most gold"" that means I need to watch how the game is going and less read and compare numbers. A definite improvement.

Beyond the basics of ""don't be a douchebag"" and ""leave her alone if she doesn't seem interested"" I was wondering how troll x pictures a successful cold approach going. Obviously this is going to be incredibly subjective, and judging from the comments in that thread some of you are open to the idea and others are strongly opposed to being approached in any context. I thought about asking but decided against it since I figured I would just get downvoted...I honestly thought it would've been more appropriate here, which I guess in retrospect doesn't really work...I assumed that a thread about not mass downvoting people's questions meant it'd be a good time to ask questions.

"RedPillWomen","t5_2xing","TRP has a lot of different types of guys. Some of them are the guys you WANT to be in a relationship with (they don't post very much - LTR is not a popular topic on TRP). But a lot of them aren't, as they simply prioritize plate spinning and engage in this sort of idiotic promiscuous behaviour. We teach that at TRP: if (s)he's doing it raw with you, (s)he's doing with with everybody else. Some guys are too stupid too learn.

Let me tell you a different side of the story. I have nothing against plate spinning. I do it because I'm a man with needs, and red pill women don't exactly have a neon sign above their head so I can approach and LTR one of them... I might stumble upon one by accident as I continue to meet new women, but there really isn't any other way, given your average woman nowadays.. I have to be ruthless in my pursuit to find what I'm looking for. Even then, she might just be putting on a show and be a reformed ho, so I have to vet tirelessly in the beginning.

The best thing you can do as a woman is learn how to avoid the promiscuous type, and put out the traits that will set you apart from the other fish and attract the kind of guy you want. We teach that here. It's not easy, as essentially you have to keep the guy interested *while withholding sex* (until commitment, which alone repels the guy you don't want anyway) and giving to him in other ways (cook, etc), and the entire time you know he's getting his sexual needs met elsewhere.

"politics","t5_2cneq","One other thing I'll throw out there, because the data is so striking. Bush's record on climate change is way better than Clinton's.

This is a graph of CO2 emissions per capita in the US since 1973. Under Clinton, emissions per capita continued to rise (and since population rose too, so did America's contribution to global warming). 

Under Dubya, per capita emissions actually collapsed. The most important factor was Bush's support for fracking. While fracking certainly has some adverse consequences, expanded natural gas use in the US actually did reduce per capita emissions substantially (the economic collapse helped too). 

And for all of your belief that there is a big difference on environmental policy, we simply can't be sure. On the most salient issue - the Keystone Pipeline - Hillary Clinton hasn't said a damn thing. And when it comes to the plan she just released, she has shied away from any attempt to price carbon.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**





Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

It's simple:

* That the future can be known means that the future already exists, otherwise there wouldn't be anything that could be known.

If there's free will, there's no future yet, so there's nothing that can be known. If the future can be known, it already is set in stone, and all choices except one are illusory.

All of that assumes the apprentice working on your car dosnt forget to put shit back on and tighten all the bolts. If you don't like the idea of that happening to your vehicle then don't bring it to any dealership or mechanic and do it yourself. All the same stuff will happen but at least its you doing it i guess.

There is a good message in this video too that hard work and preparation paid off but I would have liked it if the main character succeeded on all fronts. The overall message I took from it is that you have lots of wasted time in the day that can be used to accomplish goals in life but the part where he gets a bad grade shows that you can make time and also neglect your other responsibilities.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","Right, but that's a design choice made by a developer, not an inherent flaw with radial menus. There is no reason a radial menu can't work, all it would take would be to randomize the text locations. I like in ME games and in DA games where conversation progression are on the right side and investigation options are on the left. It gives players some control over how much exposition they get. Additionally, a game like Witcher 3 highlights all the options for you through icons and color. You know when you'll exit conversation, when you make a permanent decision, when an option is purely informational or color text. There's no reason that can't be a radial menu. The difference between that and ME is there is no binary good-evil path to take in Witcher, so the choices seem more organic. If ME didn't telegraph your decisions, nobody would complain about the way it's presented. Overall, dialogue trees don't need to be opaque lists, and a radial menu can be both a good visual representation and a quality of life feature for those using controllers.

He told me that he was 9 years old when he decided he wanted out. It was the whole ""these are the chosen people who you'll spend eternity with"", he was like ""There's no effing way I want to spend eternity with this pack of arseholes"". He had the same no christmas, no birthdays, no talking to a female that you werent going to marry immediately. His parents plan for him was to become a pioneer and dedicate his life to spreading the word and looking after his learning-disabled sister. He did not agree. 

Since we've been together I've tried really hard to give him all the things/events he missed. Killer birthday parties (he cried at his 'first' bday party when everybody sang him ""Happy Birthday"" because he'd been wondering since he was 5 what that felt like), traditional family christmases, even the easter bunny. He seems to really appreciate it. (I had typed a big thing about it all, but it was rambly so I deleted)

"rational","t5_2rdak","&gt; The Goa'uld are primarily using stolen technology, so the ease of humans using it might be a side effect of the fact that it's been filtered for ease of use? That doesn't seem like enough...

Some of the items are pretty simple. A staff weapon, for instance, only needs two controls: on and shoot. Every Jaffa warrior needs to know how to use one, in case you find a prisoner willing to talk. Failing that, every Jaffa warrior has a staff weapon, so you can use cameras to try to record how a Jaffa activates a staff weapon.

A ha'tak is a complex piece of equipment. Teal'c might be able to pilot one, but he would probably need one on hand in order to train someone else. No doubt he is missing some knowledge about how to use them, and no doubt he would accidentally omit some of his knowledge when teaching another. Still, it would probably be good enough for someone fluent in Goa'uld to work out the details in time -- with some moderately high probability of destroying the ha'tak and everyone inside.","1438387344"

1) Put gear selector in ""M""

2) Start driving

3) Shift to higher gear by either tapping the gear selector toward the (+) or with the (+) paddle when engine speed increases above 2.5-3k for day-to-day driving, higher for spirited driving.

That's really about it.  You can downshift to slow down using engine braking.  There's really nothing to learn, you're just controlling the shift points instead of letting the computer do it.  The transmission/engine computer will stop you from damaging the engine by downshifting while going too quickly or over-revving due to not shifting at the redline.

To be completely honest, aside from canyon runs, back roads, and stop-and-go traffic where engine braking is really helpful at times I've always found the manual mode to be pretty underwhelming with shifts being excessively slow and clunky.  I have not driven the newest MZ3 with the automatic, but that definitely goes for the 1st gen car; particularly the early models.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Doesn't surprise me at all.  Worked for a company that ran a bunch of propane filling stations.  The state testing for a dispensing license was a joke.  Literally an open book test.  The training class regularly involved the phrase ""This is a question on the test"" and we could bring our notes with us.

The results were a mixed bag.  Some stores did things properly and others didn't.  I had the uncommon opportunity of working at a number of them (transfers are pretty rare and I did it a lot).  The worst was a store that completely ignored most procedures and relied primarily on the OPD valve to stop filling.  For most tanks, this is simply an unsafe practice.  With some tanks, OPD valves are not required and this becomes dangerous.

I still remember a day when a large 270lbs tank was overfilled to the point that the relief valve opened.  The customer, an old lady, happened to know her shit and raged like hell.  The store manager got ripped into.

There are a lot of ""idiot"" proof safety devices in gas systems.  Unfortunately, I think this has lead to complacency and ignorance of proper safety procedures.  Most of these safety devices are spring loaded valves.  Failures are rare but possible.  Another concern is that many systems simply vent if there is too much pressure.  The system may save itself but now there is gas in the environment.  Propane is heavier than air and will pool in low spots.  ","1438387346"

&gt; The image you post must be related to board games. The game must be the focus of the picture. Examples of inappropriate content which will be removed include:

&gt; * Cat-in-box pics
&gt; * Infants ""playing"" a game
&gt; * Memes / image macros

&gt; Why don't we have these? Because they don't generally create discussion about the game. The pic of your cat or your infant may be cute, but are really about the animal or the child, not the game. The screen grab of Amazon miscategorizing a game may be funny, but it tends to generate a discussion about the miscategorization rather than the game. Memes and image macros might raise a smile, but again, don't generate conversation.

"KotakuInAction","t5_33726","I think the problem of our coverage in mainstream media is a startling lack of original research, and what little of it exists is terrible.

I think the majority of mainstream sites that cover us did so by simply quoting gaming or tech sites (each one of them being glorified blogs with a much lower standard of journalistic integrity than them) or by interviewing major anti-GG personalities. 

A rare case of original research happened with ~~TIME's~~ Newsweek's statistical analysis of \#Gamergate tweets. [They declared this supported their hypothesis of ""GG are misogynistic harassers"" despite their data coming nowhere close to supporting their interpretation.](https://medium.com/@cainejw/an-actual-statistical-analysis-of-gamergate-dfd809858f68)

Again, as I think the problem lies with research failure, I wonder sometimes: ""If (major news site) fucked up coverage of something so small like us so badly, how can I trust their account of the events going on in Congress or whatever?"" I should really shake off that attitude, though, because the fact that news sites got something wrong once is not evidence they got anything else wrong.

TL:DR The problem with mainstream media coverage is journalists not doing their own research. This has not made me less confident in mainstream media.","1438387349"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Maybe you weren't alive in the 1970s.  I was.  There was no large number of scientists claiming that we were entering a new ice age.  There was one magazine cover story and a couple of small articles that have all since been hyped endlessly by the right-wing global warming denialist movement.  The growing scientific consensus in the 1979s was that the planet was warming and that that was the result of human activity.  By the mid-eighties, this had pretty much become settled science. 

I myself was taught that global warming **was happening** when I took *Geography 201: Climatology* at my state university in the late 1980s.  My profs were not radical leftists, or hippies, or America-haters, or communists, or tree-hugging eco-nuts, nor were they corrupt conspirators looking to fabricate a crisis in order to get rich off of a bogus research gravy train.  They were a bunch of old-fart, white guys in their 60s and 70s, who'd mostly been raised and educated in the conservative midwest.  They didn't eat quiche and wear birkenstocks: they preferred buffet restaurants and clothes from J.C. Penney.  So **no**, this isn't a phony conspiracy pushed by a cabal of elitest liberal pointy-heads, it's just *science*, and it's pushed by real ordinary old-fashioned *scientists* - because all the *data* says this *science* is right.

The only conspiracy is the one funded by the oil and coal companies whose websites **you** link to and whose dishonest talking points **you** so eagerly parrot.","1438387349"

LittleBear unzips his pants and penetrates ThunderCrash's pussy.

ThunderCrash wakes up and says:

Hey! What are you doing!?

LittleBear: Shhh... go back to sleep...

ThunderCrash is scared, meanwhile Little continues.

ThunderCrash:Yesterday something weird happened...

VeniGamiz:What happened?

LittleBear then gets ThunderCrash from behind and puts him back into his bed!

ThunderCrash:WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!??!

Howland has an obviously vested interest in his ally and friend being named king or tPtwP, and there's no one left to corroborate anything he says. And if they can't convince everyone else, why does it matter what his lineage is?

And even if they can somehow convince the whole of westeros that he's part targ, why would they care? I'm sure there are dozens of targ bastards, or their decendants, running about. Probably more than a few with both northern and targ blood. Being related the the guy who was king 4 kings ago doesn't really mean anything.","1438387356"

It's because leftists will demonize any government who tries to defend the borders with any kind of violence, not just lethal violence.

It's entirely predictable. There was a book written 40 years ago called *Camp of the Saints* about a fictional influx of a million third world immigrants into France, and the author's take on how politicians would respond is *exactly* how they're responding these days. Rather than doing the logical thing and securing the borders from the beginning, they'll accuse anyone who opposes the influx as being heartless and/or racist, they'll double down on resources for the welfare state, fund advertising campaigns celebrating the value of this new diversity, and adopt laws criminalizing speaking negatively about the influx. Then as social and economic problems mount and the first million becomes another wave of two million, then three million, eventually they'll be forced to adopt reactionary policies, but it will be too late, and the existing welfare state model of Europe will be destroyed due to unsustainability.","1438387357"

First girl I had sex with had a yeast infection, and I was horrified. I didn't know about yeast infections yet, and I thought all pussy was going to smell like that. I fucked her anyway, because I wasn't going to let a bad smell steal a chance from me that might not come again any time soon. 

When my friends asked about it, knowing that I was a virgin prior, I just lied and went with the story about how fucking awesome it was. But really, I was worried about whether I wanted to even try sex again. 

Now I am a lot smarter and I actually feel bad for her, because she gave me all of the clues to know what was up. She told me repeatedly that she had been getting over a bad case of bronchitis and the doctor gave her strong antibiotics. She told me many times. Too bad for her I was too stupid to put two and two together. Now I know. Antibiotics give girls yeast infections.

I also picked Walcott over Ozil/Ramsey because he's playing as a forward and looked pretty good in the one preseason game I saw.

I also don't have room to get Aguero or Hazard in at the moment, but I have the potential to gain some money in my midfield.

I could also do something like [this](http://i.imgur.com/UBjnZfe.jpg) if dropping Giroud is worth it. He looked kind of rusty in that one preseason game I saw, but also didn't start. This team seems better for rotating between 3-5-2 and 3-4-3.","1438387358"

Makes sense commercially. It would be a big tentpole attraction. Big budget means higher risk but also higher potential reward. Attach some big names to it and that could be what Sony needs to bounce back.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","I started out using fruit flavors and then switched to more stronger flavors like maple pecan but found I didn't like the stronger flavors so I switched back to the fruit flavors. 

I started mixing fruit with vanilla custard and vanilla ice cream and have found a couple of pretty good flavors I like. I recently found that I really like Root Beer flavor so I started to work with that and used some vanilla ice cream and sweet cream with it but I have not found the perfect blend yet.

I tried the juice calculators but found them hard to work with. I use a pre-mixed nicotine base and I could not find a way to plug that into the calculators. So I just write down what I'm working with and add it to a spread sheet. That seems to work the best for me.

I purchase 1,000 ml of 70/30 VG/PG at 3mg nicotine for #19.59 and my flavors from the same company for $4.29 for 30ml of flavor. They offer TFA, LO, FW, and Capella flavors and they are all very good.

"CompetitiveHS","t5_31ns2","I would just like to chime in here as another mod. As I see it, Zhandaly was perfectly justified in asking for stats and perceiving your early answers as shifty/evasive. As moderators of the subreddit we try to keep the quality of posts high and ensure that people are not posting nonsense and trying to pass it off as ""legend"" decks. (It has happened in the past and we have caught it). Your case came off as suspicious with 4 or 5 different ""legend deck"" posts in the span of much less than a month. (With some of them featuring decidedly off meta choices like hogger) He also saw the even multiples of 5% in your matchup win rates to be suspicious and something else that is easily faked. Because of this /u/Zhandaly decided to investigate and ask for more concrete proof from you. 

I understand that it can feel like you're under attack when people are scrutinizing you and viewing you with suspicion. Please keep in mind that have no horses in the race of what stays or goes on the subreddit other than a desire to keep this a place for high level discussion and guides. We have one moderator who is associated with teamArchon and writes for them but he was not in any way involved in this decision. The rest of the mod team are not associated in any way with any other websites.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; First, I thought when you came here you might want to have an actual discussion.

I do, though I haven't found the start of this exchange particularly promising.

&gt; Instead it seems you have gone over my points and then said uh-uh quite a bit while pretending you don't understand what I am talking about.

I'm not pretending anything: your remarks on my comments are consistently very strange, you evidently are laboring under pervasive misunderstanding about what it is I am saying.

We can deal with that problem reasonably, try to resolve this misunderstanding so that you can understand what I'm saying, and then see what your objections to *that* are, if you still have any.  Or, you can play this game where your initial reaction, no matter how inaccurate it turns out to be, is all you'll ever admit to entertain--so that any corrections of it get dismissed as disingenuous--and I can leave you to it and find something better to do with my time.

&gt; Rather than responding to the message, you are choosing details to disagree with.

The only thing like disagreement in my comment was my disagreement with your misrepresenting my remark about how the term 'atheism' is sometimes used in a way which subsumes what is normally called 'agnosticism', and my disagreement with your misattributing to me the aim of telling people they're wrong to call themselves atheists.  But these aren't really disagreements so much as you simply misrepresenting me, and me trying to correct the record.

The rest of the post was just puzzlement at what seemed like a long list of non sequiturs from you.

As for responding to the ""details"" of your comment rather than to the ""message"" of it, I'm afraid I can't guess what this distinction might mean.

&gt; The only part that specifically related to you in the first post was the single sentence where I mentioned your name. 

Well, in the last comment, when I asked what your objection to me was, you answered ""First, everything I just said above already"", i.e. referring to the remarks of your original comment.  So you can understand why I responded to this claim that the remarks of your original comment were objections to me.  You seem to be saying now that they *weren't* objections to me, which does explain my not finding any objections there.  Anyway, I think that settles this point.

&gt; Didn't say you were responsible...

I asked you what your objections were to what I said, and you answered ""Second, your post is linked every time...[etc.]""  So you can understand why I responded to this claim that other people linking my post was an objection to something I've said.  You seem to be saying now that it *isn't*, which is consistent with my not finding it to be an objection.  So I'm glad that point is settled too.

&gt; ...and didn't ask you to come here to defend yourself. 

I don't have any interest in ""defend[ing] myself.""  I have an interest in people being reasonable, when I say things I give reasons for them, I stand behind them just so far as the reasons support them, and so I have an interest in engaging with reasonable criticisms to things I've said.

You--correct me if I'm wrong--are someone I've never spoken to before, posting in a community I don't post in, dedicated to a subject I find obnoxious, made a post referencing by name, with the /u/ code so that I would be notified about it, making snide remarks about me.  I give you the benefit of the doubt and assume that your snide remarks were just a clumsy way of expressing some reasonable critique you were interested in offering for discussion, and so I responded by inviting you to offer that.

If you were in fact interested in that, then here we are.  If not, then I guess we're done here.

&gt; I said that others should not blindly link to your post...

If people other than me are doing something you object to, I suggest you take it up with them.  It's not my concern.  What I had asked you for is what your objections *to things I'd said* were.  You seem to have agreed above that I'm not responsible for things other people do, so let's consider this point settled and drop it.

&gt; ...your post, which is based off something you quoted by SEOP, which is based on wrong information.

My comments reference two peer-reviewed academic resources (the *Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy* and *Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy*), a comment from the editorial staff of one of these resources addressing this specific issue, nine major dictionaries, perhaps the most important book on atheism from the so-called ""New Atheists"" (Dawkins' *God Delusion*), a comment by another of the ""New Atheists"" (Hitchens) on this specific issue, and an etymological dictionary.

If we're to accept that the content of these works is ""wrong"", you'll have to provide more support for this thesis than your mere say so.

&gt; That's you refuting those ideas...

No, it isn't.  (B) is just a definition, while (A), (C), and (D) are just consequences of a definition.  As such, there isn't anything here to refute--as I explain at length in the second of my comments.

&gt; ...those ideas that hardly anyone holds.

If indeed I were refuting them, it would be all the better for me the less people who hole them.

&gt; I am claiming to be an atheist...

Yes, but why are you telling *me* this?  I don't care what you're claiming to be.  Am I forgotten some extended conversation we've had in the past where I started caring about what you call yourself?  Unless I am, call yourself a tortoise for all I care.

But whatever you call yourself, if you're going to call me out by name, in a way so that I'll be notified that you're doing it, while making snide remarks about me--back them up with some reasoned argument.

&gt; ""This is like"" is what you said before that. You said they are like in comparison.

They are alike in the sense--stated in the comment you're quoting--that both of them are a case where two different notions are included under the reference of a single term.

This is rather different than them being ""the exact same thing"", which of course they are not, and never did I suggest otherwise.

&gt; Atheist is the same, as it includes agnostics as well.

Says you, but I supplied numerous references, including peer-reviewed academic sources, claiming the opposite.

Moreover, *agnostics* claim the opposite.  Indeed, the term was coined *explicitly* to distinguish it from atheism.  Here's Huxley, who coined the term, explaining his motivation for it: ""When I reached intellectual maturity and began to ask myself whether I was an atheist, a theist, or a pantheist; a materialist or an idealist; Christian or a freethinker; I found that the more I learned and reflected, the less ready was the answer; until, at last, I came to the conclusion that I had neither art nor part with any of these denominations, except the last."" (Huxley, [Agnosticism](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE5/Agn.html))  NB: he calls himself an agnostic because he identifies as having ""neither art nor part"" with *neither* theism *nor* atheism.  Indeed, in his earliest published statement on the matter, he claims from the agnostic's standpoint, atheism is *more* objectionable than theism (Huxley, [Agnosticism: A Symposium](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/UnColl/Rdetc/AgnAnn.html)).

Furthermore, he identifies (in *Agnosticism*) Kant's epistemology as the framework and basis for the position he is calling by this name.  Kant is likewise explicit about this position being antithetical to atheism.  Indeed, he goes so far as to state in the preface to his *Critique of Pure Reason* that one of its goals is to ""cut off, at the very root"" the basis for atheism (B xxxiv).  This aim is reiterated as the conclusion of his comments on theology (B 668+).

(NB: To the list of references I've given for my comments, add these three primary sources.)

This is particularly important, since this whole exchange began with you complaining how condescending it was to tell people what they're allowed to call themselves.  It turns out this complaint was misdirected: I've never maintained that someone calling themselves an atheist should not do so.  But, even worse, this complaint, ironically, deserves to be directed to *your* position.  For the principle that people should be allowed to determine what to call themselves is the very principle I'm defending, against the demand--here championed by you--that agnostics, in spite of vehemently rejecting this notion, have to be identified as atheists.

&gt; I don't know what your ""what?"" question is in reference to.

Well, your comment that I'd quoted before it.  I suppose you could read my ""What?"" as a ""What on earth are you talking about?""

&gt; Is this the complete extent of your SEOP evidence? 

You're asking me if the complete extent of my reference to the *SEP* is a reference to, in particular, the peer-reviewed article found there which explicitly addresses the issue at hand?  What else would I refer to in an encyclopedia other than the article which is about the topic we're discussing?

&gt; I say that I disagree with him, most specifically because he starts the entire argument with what I consider a false definition...

Yes, I understand that you consider the claims we can consistently find in peer-reviewed academic resources false.  That would be the whole point of referring someone like you to such resources.

Your implication seems to be that all my references to primary sources and peer-reviewed scholarship get trumped by you saying they're wrong.  But this is such a bizarre response, that I feel like it doesn't really need any rebuttal from other than to simply point it out.  I mean, I expect any reader I could sway with argument already sees the problem for you here.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","Yeah, I can really understand how you are thinking. I can also agree with a lot of the things you said! You seem to look at it in a healthy and quite proper way.   

I also think that it can be turned around a bit when it comes to sound and technology, depending on how you want to look at it. For example, some of Robert Bresson's films from the 50s have an amazing and meticulous detail when it comes to sound design, something I have never seen in any newer film. I just get so impressed over how he used sound, rather than caring about technical aspects like IMAX and what technology can offer today etc.   

His way of doing movies and his own uncompromising form really stands out, even decades after his prime. This is one of the reasons he's one of my favourite directors, not because his films are considered classics, but because they still feel fresh today, have a timeless and unique feeling to them, as well as offering depth and a lot of feelings, at least for me.    

Another thing that I find interesting is that many older movies just look so much better than many new ones. But that can also do much with taste of course. It's not always easy to judge movies anyways, but it's interesting to see how others do and think.    ","1438387365"

The lack of tracks behind the rover. The lack of blast crater underneath the lander but well defined footprints in the ground.

Canadian knows about Tom and the NDP the least, except the Rae days, or  Greg Selinger. As for the rest of left leaning voters are angry at tom for placing NDP into center even center right in their eyes. While Green party and the Liberal(less so) are at pretend to battering at the left on their newer platforms.  

  Until the last election, Canada have been govern by two parties, and only the Conservative and the Liberal are seem to have chance to win. it miracle has happen to NDP during 1988 where it poll ahead both party for a while and had the best third party result ever since election 1921. 
Yet still far behind the official opposition. It also take Green party 30 years of struggling to win it's first seat in HoC.  This show how hard for a third party to have a chance in this Climate. 
NDP has is a been fighting  guerrilla warfare ever since. And it predecessors dates back to labour, Progressive, United Farmers, CCF. The most progressive party has fallen many time yet found a way rise from the ashes and still fighting to this day. 

SO This is my prediction: if NDP does badly. pretty likely in my eyes. CPC will continue to surge and NDP runs out of steam. LPC/green gets ""free air time"" from the debates. While people forgets about NDP.  Justin with his appeal and Trudeau legacy will gain votes to overpass NDP or win the election alright. but NDP will fall back to it's pre Jack times.  This will disappoint Quebec so much that from the following election NDP might lost Quebec end up with third or even forth place. 

If green get breakthrough during these elections, NDP might even fall to to fifth place and ceases. However, I do hope the Progressive will reborn into a new party or join the green party to carry it's flag.

Flanking is very important as well, getting another unit into the flank of an already engaged unit can be devastating. I like to send around some skirmishers and shoot them in their butts. I generally have the cavalry hidden somewhere and use them to take out enemy ranged units and send them into combats that i'm already winning to free up those units to make more flanking charges. warhounds work well in the flank and enemy skirmishers but not well against unengaged melee units or at the front of melee units.

if you have archers shooting make sure you use heavy shot against high armoured units to do more damage and try get them shooting the flank/rear so they cant use their shields.","1438387371"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","But, my dear friend, what if one is forced to partake in a 'fistfight' due to the darstardly behaviour of a few men, towards an esteemed lady of rank, one such as myself, Lady Margaret Dorothy Alexander.

Before I embark upon my story, I would first like to clarify the proper definition of a fistfight. Now, one may commonly assume that it is a fight where the participants use only knuckles and brute force. I am afraid that I must argue with this definition. For is a Lady not permanently attached to her parasol? Do the fundamental laws of etiquette not state that, thou shall, in all circumstances, carry a parasol of large proportions to protect thy beauteous face from the gaze of lustful men? 

In this case, I beg you, dear gentlemen, to validate my use of the parasol in the following story. 

I was strolling along Cobbler's avenue last week in London, peering at the rhododendrons and the gossip columns, hoping to find a morsel of information regarding my acquaintences, where suddenly, a group of street urchins seized upon my handbag. 

Never, since my son Reginald declared his will to elope with a servant girl, was I so shocked. Thankfully, on that occasion, and this one, I was able to end the situation with my ingenuity. 

I am not a woman to violent temperament, by any means. But, my friends, today, I fought like Samson fought the lion. Using my parasol as a lance, and my fan as a shield, I charged at these ruffians, like the good Arthurian knights of days gone by. 
Indeed, they scurried like pigeons.

Was this not entirely necessary? Do you not agree, good gentlemen, that in this occasion, a fistfight was greatly justified?","1438387373"

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","One thing I didn't get from your post was pain-points, or problems. You listed some ideas you had, but not why you think there is an opportunity for them. Most great companies solve a problem that the founder faces or has faced so here's my advice:

1. Start thinking about [pain-points](http://pointsandfigures.com/2012/04/27/whats-a-pain-point/) that you encounter as a person living in your city or country. Literally carry a notebook with you and write down your daily annoyances, things you wish were easier, and conditions that negatively effect your life, as they come up. Make it broader, and think about this over a wider time scale. Talk to your friends, or other people to see what their pain points are. If something keeps coming up over and over again, it might be a good opportunity. 

2. Once you have a list of problems that need to be solved, see if you can think of solutions to any of them through a small business or startup. I'd do this with several of your ideas.

3. Ask people around you if they would use this service, or if they would need this service. They aren't always right, sometimes if you build it they will realize how great it is even if they couldn't really understand its importance ahead of time, but if you get a few people who can validate your idea and are in your market, it's a good indicator that you might be building a company with a good product-market fit. 

4. Once you have a few validated ideas, see how you can make them take advantage of the trends that you mentioned, and start asking the critical questions about how you would actually implement them. If one particularly grabs your interest, run with that. 

I think the bottom line is that unless other commenters are there, it's going to be hard for us to identify the best areas of potential growth for your nascent business. The comments from /u/timetoentrepreneur about looking at other similar markets and /u/tractionvc about getting something tangible into people's hands and then rapidly changing from feedback are also great pieces of advice.

( Worked for me. )

If women can use toys to masturbate, guys should be able to use aids to masturbate + keep the sensitivity + normal sensation there.

Oh.  

When you do the nasty you'll perform nicely.  :)

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; He thinks that no one should call themselves agnostic because we don't have to have 100% knowledge to believe something...

No, he doesn't.  Here's what he says about who should call themselves what:

""In the light of these considerations let us consider the appropriateness or otherwise of someone (call him ‘Philo’) describing himself as a theist, atheist or agnostic. I would suggest that if Philo estimates the various plausibilities to be such that on the evidence before him the probability of theism comes out near to one he should describe himself as a theist and if it comes out near zero he should call himself an atheist, and if it comes out somewhere in the middle he should call himself an agnostic.""

This is what is usually said about the matter.

&gt; He closes with ""these considerations are perhaps more a matter for sociologists than for philosophers"", admitting that he doesn't have the final say in it.

The expression ""these considerations"" is not a reference to everything he's said in the entire article, but rather to the idea that ""an atheist might describe herself as an agnostic [on] purely pragmatic [grounds]"", such as ""out of mere politeness or in some circumstances from fear of giving even more offence"", or if they ""treated the [theistic] doctrine as mere myth suitable for literal consumption by the local yokels in the interests of social stability"", or if they ""are equally repelled by the fanaticism associated with some forms of theism and by the boring obsessiveness of what Hilary Putnam has called ‘the village atheist’.""

In any case, the implication of the article is not that Smart personally has ""the final say"" on how these terms are used.  This is an article in a peer-review, generalist encyclopedia: the articles are meant to report on the basic points of academic consensus, rather than on idiosyncratic beliefs of the authors.

&gt; Is disbelief the same as an opposing belief, or the same as not having a belief?

&gt; Is an agnostic, by your understanding of the definition, a weak atheist?

&gt; Does atheism, by rule not example, propose a positive belief that no gods exist?

I don't particularly care how people define their terms, as long as they're clear and consistent about it.

The way 'atheist' is typically used, i.e. in popular or in academic writing, it refers to what Flew calls ""positive atheism"" (as I've documented with numerous sources).  The way 'agnostic' is typically used, it (but not it alone) refers to what Flew calls ""negative atheism"", which I assume is what you have in mind by the expression ""weak atheism"" (as I've documented with numerous sources).


&gt; Do words always mean the same thing as they did when they were first put into use; can definitions change over time?

Of course definitions change over time.","1438387375"

"weddingplanning","t5_2rv3t","You have every right to expect support and some extra efforts (within reason) from your bridal party, and from your responses I think you understand that. This is not the issue.

If you decide to not have a bridal party at all, it might soften the blow from demoting your only bridesmaid, especially since you're having such an intimate ceremony. But you will probably have to deal with hurt feelings. If it were me, I would be disappointed, but ultimately I'd understand and still want to support you for your wedding. It's a tough call, and you really need to weigh the possible outcomes either way. 

The wedding party was one of the most stressful parts of the planning. Despite the drama that came up throughout the process, I'm really glad I had the girls who stood with me. I've also been in weddings where one of the girls put her own interests over the bride's, which caused a lot of strain on their relationship. But after the wedding they mended their relationship, which I don't think would have been possible if the friend was demoted. I really wish you luck as you think this through. 

(Seriously, it's not ridiculous for you to want your bridesmaid to come and support you for dress shopping, especially since you don't have other close people to go with.)

THe minimum spec for a helmet IMHO is SNELL or ECE certified. DOT alone is not enough.


$100-$200 is about the going rate. Lots of great lids can be had in this price range. A few suggestions include [the HJC CL-16](http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/hjc-cl-17-helmet),  the [scorpion EX-410](http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/scorpion-exo-r410-airline-helmet), and [the bell vortex.](http://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/bell-vortex-rally-helmet)


If you search around for closeouts you can find even better deals. Like [this HJC Lorenzo Replica](http://www.sportbiketrackgear.com/hjc-fg-17-x-fuera-mc-1-helmet-closeout/) or [this bell star over at SportbikeTrackGear.](http://www.sportbiketrackgear.com/bell-star-solid-helmet-2013-model/) That's a $550 helmet for $200. I have [the carbon version of that helmet and love the shit out of it.](http://i.imgur.com/hbzdTt6.jpg)


If you're buying any helmet over $300 you can't really spend the money wrong. They are all good. The only issue is sizing and fit, which places like Revzilla will happily let you return the item if the fit is wrong(has pressure points on your head).

but even now that i have been clean for more than 2 weeks and i am clearheaded, i still do not approve of pills and drugs being stuck up people's asses. just like i do not approve of people injecting drugs. what the fuck more do you get by sticking it up your ass or vein that you couldn't get by snorting it or swallowing it? the other dude says that you absorb 25% when you snort it, and 30% when you swallow it. so i guess it's even more when you stick it up your ass or inject it. but fuck, for a few percent of increased absorption someone is going to stick a fucking pill up his ass? that's fucking intense as shit.. just take double the fucking amount of you want to get high, don't stick shit up your ass or inject it to get all of those nasty needle marks all over the arms. what does that get you? it's not even about judging people.. it's just simple logic if you know what this painkiller shit is about.. the tolerance plays with you.. me i took hydromorph contin 60-75mg per day for 6 years and i always stuck to the same dose. if i did a big line in the morning, i would do smaller ones later in the day. or vice versa. i had about 25000mg with me almost all the time. usually went up and down by about 5000mg on different days depending on how many i passed. so 20000-30000mg. that is enough to knock out ten fucking elephants. i could have done as many as i wanted.

but once you do this shit and you start to understand how it works, you get that you will not get any benefit from increasing the dose. if you take 150mg instead of 75mg, you will feel it for a week and then after that the 150mg will feel the same exact thing as the 75mg did a week ago, except now you pay twice as much and you are twice as addicted. you can do it once in a while when you want to feel something, but other than that there is just no point. it's the same shit with injecting shit. what would that have accomplished for me? yeah, it probably would have done something and i would have felt and remembered what getting high off this shit was like. but i guarantee you that i would have been way more addicted. and after injecting the shit for a week or two, it would have ended up the same. once again, it would have done the same exact shit that 75mg a day snorted did a few weeks before, which means to not feel shit and to just be stable and normal.  

but i guess some people are more naive and impressionable and believe that using drugs in fucked up ways like putting pills up their asses, injecting shit, and smoking fentanyl gel is cool. someone shows them, they are impressionable, and they fall into that trap. it feels good for a week, then they are right back at the same fucking point except now they are more addicted because they are injecting the shit or whatever. their ass is fucked from the pills, their lungs are fucked from smoking pills and fentanyl gel, their arms are all fucked because of the needles, etc. can't even go to the fucking beach in the summer or wear a damn t-shirt.. 

holy fuck, seriously.. you ask me if i know where i am.. i know exactly where i am. please tell me, what is the point of taking painkillers if you have no pain? why did you, me, and others do this shit? it's to fucking relax and to have fun. you are not having any fucking fun when you can't even go to the fucking beach in the summer or wear a damn t-shirt because you have needle marks all over your arms and shit.. fuck! i know that we are in a place where people are impressionable and repeat what other people do when they see some retard stick some shit up his ass because ""it is absorbed about 5% more"", lol.. but this shit is serious.. we are talking about fucking needle marks and shit.

this reminds me of a guy i knew.. came to see me every day for dilaudid. did like maybe 50-80 bucks worth, so say 6-10 8mgs a day. fucking guy had this crazy witch girlfriend that worked minimum wage and gave him ALL of her money to get high. minimum wage is what, 700 bucks paychecks after they tax your ass? so 350 bucks a week. fucking guy had at least 50 bucks GUARANTEED that his witch left him when she left for work. guy could have just used that fifty and buy six of them and that's it. that's 48mg dilaudid a day. it's not that bad for zero fucking work. but nope, the dude would get in his fucking car and go pick up scrap metal.. drive around all fucking day. he would do an injection in his car, then go play in a garbage bin to find a few pennies worth of metal. in say 6-8 hours, the dude would make like 20 bucks. he would do hits all day long in his car and then spend the day in the car driving to the junkyard and shit to bring his metal. fucking guy would even take out the copper from cables. and i know you can bring the cables themselves and just get a price like that by weight no matter what the cable was. but omg you get like 1 extra buck per pound if it's the pure copper wire and no cable! that is going to be a big total of 6 dollars instead of 4 dollars! holy fuck 2 dollars difference! that will allow me to have the 72 dollars needed to buy 9 of them instead of being stuck with 70 dollars that only gets me 8 of them and 6 dollars left over! woah so amazing!

so instead of fucking relaxing at home or doing something enjoyable with his 6 pills, the dude would spend all day wasting his shit doing hits in his car for like 8 hours just to get an extra 20 bucks. and if at least he spent the fucking 20 bucks on something normal like i don't know.. some nice food or whatever.. but nope, he would use the extra 20 dollars to get like 2-3 extra pills. which of course were fucking wasted since he was jumping in dumpsters all fucking day long.

it makes no sense.. it's not about judging people on how they take their drugs, it's just simple logic.. you can inject five of them at once and spend the day running around and not enjoying it for a fucking second.. but it just doesn't make any sense. some people spend their entire fucking life energy to do shit that is disgusting or extremely unpleasant just to get 10 pills instead of 9 pills, even though the 9 could require no effort at all and the last one can require them like 6 hours of doing random shit like looking for cans, picking up metal, begging for change, etc.

this is the type of shit that officially turns people into junkies instead of just taking their shit to relax and enjoy themselves..

I personally like linux more because the system has a certain simplicity behind it, compared to windows, where everything is hidden behind menus. This is especially interesting considering I like working with servers and menus are in the way for me.

Also, customizing my desktop and being able to switch most things out (except Xorg maybe) is very nice, and I have the possibility to build a more productive desktop than I've ever could on Windows.

Oh shit, you bought two? Have 10% off- thats 45 bucks a g.
Homie, did you wake up early and came in between 9-11 Sunday-Thursday? ----- Have an extra 5 bucks off every concentrate we have.

2) Flower is always phenomenal and if you choose you can go to a private room where they will weigh it out in front of you and you can look at as many jars as you want.

3) Great customer service, people always smiling!

4) Sometimes there can be a wait, but then I just go off the express line and the people up there are always helpful and I find the best of what I am looking for. I'm very specific on what I want to smoke and how I want to feel and they get it spot on

"Random_Acts_Of_Amazon","t5_2tx47","Right away I knew the answer to this...unfortunately.  I had a friend in elementary school and she was invited to my birthday.  We lived in Turkey at the time and she was coming back home from a ski trip or something and decided to buy my gift on her way back...so she brings this large gift bag that weighed a good 25-30 pounds it felt like.  I was like THIS IS THE BEST!  You know, the best presents are always the heaviest right?  Wrong.  She had stopped at some crazy ass shop in downtown Adana and bought me a HALF PAINTED, creepy-as-shit porcelain clown doll...on a swing.  I was being recorded as I opened the gifts and we rewatched and rewatched the footage, my parents dying of laughter at how my face went from 'knowing-this-is-going-to-be-AWESOME!' to 'pale-sick-disgusted' and then I said...""thank you, 'friend', he's really...cute"".  So that was the worst, especially because I had a sleepover after the party and everyone thought it'd be HILARIOUS to continuously hide the creepy clown all around the house that night.

One of our stats guys says ""JJ hits a better shooting percentage from 0-5 feet than Amare Stoudemire.""
I said ""you're kidding me right?""
He said ""no it's right here 65% to 62%.""
I'm thinking ""no that's impossible."" Amare is one of the great finishers in the history of this league especially with all of the tough four footers... So we watched JJ Hickson, and after about 20 minutes I realized... All he can do is dunk. He didn't try any from 2-5 feet.","1438387386"

If you talk to your ex and give the relationship a chance; laying ground rules and communicating effectively, you could have a lifetime of happiness at the risk of a little more heartache.

If you give this new guy a chance; you can have happiness now, but with complete uncertainty as to what the future holds.

My suggestion: Communicate with your ex and give it a chance. Address everything you have concerns about. Give it a trial. See where it goes. If the new guy has been understanding thus far, he will probably still be there should the trial fail.

If you take my suggestion, be honest with both of them. If you play both side of the field, you might end up with neither. Follow your heart, but remain in reality.","1438387387"

I understand the film industry is a closed scene, It really is everywhere. That's why I would love to chat with people who are interested or just plain amateurs that want to make something. I'm not seeking a job in the film industry, but doing some stuff as a hobby and helping out would be great. The film industry is the same everywhere. You have to know the right people, so, getting to know people can perhaps, later on, lead you to the right people.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","Quote from one of sources:

SURRENDER OPTION
As a final note, we wanted to address the issue of a Surrender option. For now, we do not believe the addition of a Surrender option is needed in Heroes of the Storm.

Heroes of the Storm matches are designed to be fast-paced, action packed, and played in under twenty minutes. In our experience, the community's feedback, and internal data has shown that there are ample opportunities to mount a comeback. We believe the game is never officially over until the core is destroyed. Adding a Surrender option could tempt players to bail out at the slightest setback, removing focus from the game and potentially introduce even more toxic behavior. As Heroes of the Storm matures, it could be something we’ll add in the future. But, for now, we love to see awesome games where teams mount a comeback and win.

-------------
What I want to see is a percent of games won by teams having 1+ level handicap. When it is obvious that my random group can not into elementary cooperation (how did it happen that they have same MMR as me?!), I wish to have an option to surrender without any negative effects like spending 6 minutes in purgatory queue. IMHO MMR system was flawed in random BG in WoW, because I understand the math behind this.","1438387387"

On the Pro Jr, I don't feel like I get enough tone with volume down on 2 in the rec room, and then if I engage a drive pedal, the volume kicks back up again and there's no where down from 2!

I felt incredibly stupid and something I always loved doing suddenly became so difficult. 

But you're right- we do get through it if we go easy on ourselves. Allowing myself to feel stupid only made it worse and put resistance on my path to allow it to heal itself. I feel pretty good now. I still have my moments, but I'm leaps and bounds farther than I was when this came about. I put books in my hands of authors I always respected, and that helped to turn the cogs differently and back to my normal self. Maybe you can do something similar- put yourself in situations you always felt comfortable in. I don't mean where your fears feel quieter, I mean where you- before the fears- felt comfortable.

Or Varus' lore where he comes to the League to hunt the the Noxian bastards that scorched his village. This lore has been so much better than the lore of newer champs like Jinx where she simply mindlessly destroys things or Zac who is a completely one dimensional ""super hero"". On top of that, we had cool events like the Ionian invasion which had a logical impact on Summoners Rift (adding Ionian boots of lucidity) since you could say the Institute did something in response to that event.

"russian","t5_2qlc6","&gt;Привет, и извините за любые плохо используемы**е** фраз**ы**, я до сих пор очень **нов(а?)** для этого, ха-ха

Hello, and you do not seem very new at this!
Excuse me for [accusative]. Кого? Что? As плохо используемые фразы are inanimate soulless abstract objects, their form in this case would be the same as in nominative.
Also, плохо используемые is not very correct words, because of differences between 'to use' and 'использовать'. It sounds like your sentences are correct and have big potential, but you do not use them fully. Compare with 'У меня есть несколько гектаров земли, и я плохо их использую, ничего не выращиваю'. It's better to use 'неправильные фразы' or 'неправильно построенные фразы' or 'неправильно употребляемые фразы' or just 'ошибки', depending on context of what you mean under 'bad use'.

Я до сих пор очень нов/нова для этого is unnatural way to formulate this in Russian. It will be better with turning 'это' in subject and you in object. 'Мне это до сих пор внове/в новинку'.

&gt;Я живу в городе между Лестер**ом и Гр**э**нтх**эм**ом**, Англия.

You can be between [instrumental] and [instrumental]. Note, while some location names are new for Russian language and must be translated with transcription or transliteration, there are some traditions about names of well-known places. England is one of them. While I did not know before about existing of Грэнтхэм, all such names are ended with -хэм in Russian and Google approved spelling it through э in both cases.

Also, [A lower level location], [A higher level location] is unnatural for Russian too. I can only remember some badly translated American movies, where somebody arrives to Чикаго, штат Иллинойс etc. It will be better as 'между Лестером и Грэнтхэмом в Англии', or even more better 'в Англии между Лестером и Грэнтхэмом'. В [prepositional].

&gt;Город находится в середине сельской местности

В середине sound if you took a ruler, found a middle of that местность and exactly in this middle the city is. Use 'посреди' instead, it is not so precise and determinate.

&gt;но есть много полезных связей **с** близлежащи**ми** город**ами**, таки**ми** как Питерборо или даже Лондон, **дорога в который** занимает около часа двадцати минут.

You do not need those 'and' separators in cases like that with hours and minutes, hundreds and tens etc.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","The bible actually says what to do in case of disagreement.

The old days, things were ""very far apart"". So it could take generations before the ""supreme court"" decided on an issue.

So say your local judge decided you had to act in a certain way, and you do, but 2 generations after that the supreme court decides differently. What happens?

Well, according to the Tora, if 2 generations have passed, you should continue to do what your local Rabi decided. Why? Because you can't have a whole area change their behavior to follow a certain rule and then just declare that rule invalid.

So that's why there are basically 2 ""types"" of Judaism: Ashkenaz (basically ""European"") and Sfarad (basically ""Arab""). These communities were very far from each other for a long time, so some decisions were made differently in both. 

A big example is - what are you allowed to eat during Passover. The Europeans, having more food variety, banned more types of food than the Arabs.

And to this day it remains. Those of ""Arab"" descent are allowed to eat kinds of food during passover that those of ""European"" descent are not. 

And that's OK. No one claims the other is ""wrong"". No one claims the other ""isn't a real Jew"". During passover, some food is allowed for some Jews and not allowed for others. And it's fine.

--------------

Differently, there are issues that the ""supreme court"" hasn't addressed at all. And then what? Then the local judges are the ones who count.

But the laws set forth by these local judges only apply to the people who ""follow them"". And that's fine. 

It's like different states (or counties, or cities even) in the US can have different laws - but you don't claim Mississippi people ""aren't Americans"" because they don't follow a NY law, right? You don't claim they are ""criminals"" or ""breaking the law"" for not following a law of a different state, right? They are still just as American, under the same judicial mechanism of the constitution, but in a different place.

You might claim Mississippi law makers are stupid, and make stupid laws (and you often do claim that). But that's different than calling the people following these laws ""criminals"".

Same here: different Jew ""sects"" follow different Rabis, and as such can follow slightly different interpretations of the laws.

It doesn't make them ""bad Jews"", or ""not Jews"". It makes them ""Jews from a different sect"". And that's fine. And you can change sects if you want, and that's fine too.

And you can claim that the Rabi of ""that other court"" is stupid and makes bad laws (and they say that a LOT), but it doesn't make the people who follow him ""bad Jews"". It might make them stupid (in the sense of ""Why would anyone stay in Alabama with this new law? I would have moved from there to a more sane state"" sense), but that's different than calling them ""infidels"" (or, in the US, ""traitors"")

The Ultra Orthodox are actually very fragmented like that, with a LOT different ""Rabis"" having different courts that follow them. It's a political mess really.","1438387392"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Linux itself only refers to the kernel. That's the thing handling your harware / the layer between (userspace) software and hardware to speak in layman terms. Based on that there are a number of distributions, which take care of the rest: they basically provide you with an usable system, consisting of preinstalled software, a way to obtain more (repositiories and package manager) and a way to install it (normally a GUI, but there are some ""minimalistic"" distros without it).

[DistroWatch has a great page comparing the most popular distros](http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=major&amp;language=EN)

I personally recommend you a *buntu flavour (a Ubuntu derivat or fork), because they have everything needed installed, are not too strict on free software, so you can obtain stuff like Steam, proprietary GPU drivers or Teamspeak easily. Also they are the most supported distros by companies like VALVe.

Basically your choice is based on the initial DE (Desktop Environment) the flavour provides: Ubuntu uses Unity (the default), Kubuntu KDE (relatively Windows-like and pretty full-fledged, but still has some bugs and crashes sometimes - they just did a major rewrite), Ubuntu GNOME (uses GNOME, which has a more ""experimental"" UX, pretty different to Windows) or Xubuntu (Uses XFCE: Ressource savy and minimalistic, but ugly defaults).

There is also Linux Mint, which is a ""real"" derivat of Ubuntu and uses Cinnamon, a DE similiar from the look-and-feel to Windows, but more ressourceful than KDE (though less full-fledged). Mint provides even greater defaults (Media codecs installed for example) and is also relatively frendly to customization and exploration.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","yes it is a thing

your best resource for information is probably going to be miners as they are by far the most concerned with minimising power consumption and therefore heat

a chip like the fx8350 might come with a stock voltage of 1.3v to almost 1.4v in some cases depending on binning. many people have found that their chip is stable at the stock clocks with only 1.2v. the voltage/power consumption relationship is somewhat exponential i believe so this will reduce power usage by more than the ~7.5% reduction that the numbers suggest

i think you already understand this but i'll say it anyway - the actual temperatures of your chips are largely irrelevant as they do not necessarily correlate to power consumption. a gpu using 100w with a reference cooler will run a lot hotter than an identical 100w chip in a custom loop but they are both outputting 100w of heat

edit: i should probably add that higher temperatures can increase leakage so the first chip in my example might use a little more than 100w, usually leave this out so as not to confuse the issue","1438387394"

It is: overpopulation is not related to territory exclusively; it's the ratio of people to living spaces: cities, infrastructures, jobs  and such.   Africa has too many people, cities that are too big and way too many births. Overpopulation is also a projection; at the current rate, there will be even more people in Africa, so birth control is absolutely key for the continent.","1438387394"

Being a JW makes you see all the flaws in other religions, then when you realize the JWs are just as flawed, that scratches the last one off the list.

I'd hazard a guess that most born-in exjws just go atheist/agnostic.  And this particular community clearly tends toward atheism.  That's kind of why I decided to hang out here instead of some other exjw community.  I feel most at home here.

I don't have anything against the concept of *spirituality* though.  In fact, I respect it more now that I'm out of the JWs.  When I was mentally in, the JWs sense of spirituality didn't really mean anything to me, and they mocked any other form of spirituality.  Now I can see and respect spirituality for what it is, a subjective, individually experienced sensation, very much like the perception of beauty.

Do you have a thermo*stat* for the UTH? If the substrate feels warm, what does the glass under the substrate feel like? 

Remember your surface skin temp is at least 90 degrees if not warmer. So if it feels warm to you, it may be too warm for your snake! Depending on what and where your thermometer is, I'd recommend getting something like an infrared or digital probe thermometer that will tell you exact temps where your snake sits. 

As for substrate, Aspen tends to be the most dry. Do you have humidity issues that require misting? You might consider a more most substrate like cocohusk, Ecoearth, or cypress. These hold moisture so much better than aspen and with less misting! 

On a related note, is the mesh screen on top of your tank open? If so, covering most of it with tin foil or plastic wrap will help seal in humidity. 

Finally, that's a bummer about only eating live. Some snakes are just stubborn like that. At least he's on rats and not mice! Hopefully if you get his feeding response up and more regular, you may be able to switch him over in the future. You may have try freshly killed a few times to transition from live to frozen -thawed.","1438387395"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; ...establishing whether any given assertion of fact is true [...] essentially consists of look and see. The essential quality of a factual assertion is that experience in case it is true will be different from experience in case it is false.

I think that the misconception here is that you think morals are an empiricist matter. On the contrary, morality is primarily viewed as a rationalist matter. I.e., you cannot say that morals can't be true just because you cannot put them under a microscope, in the same way that you cannot say that statements in abstract algebra can't be true just because you cannot put them under a microscope.

&gt; In case someone stubbornly refuses to recognize the truth of some true factual assertion, we can, in principle, summon objective other parties.

Couldn't I do the same thing with my claim that ""Killing people for sport is wrong""? ""Other parties"" would probably agree with me on this statement and probably further affirm that part of the reason they don't murder is because they believe it to be wrong. Moral disagreement is not as much of a problem as relativists seem to make it out.

&gt; ...other people can see it...

Once again, seems like you are trying to reduce morals to empiricism.

&gt; empirical/analytic way of thinking

Not sure what you mean by this.

&gt; Now comes the moral realist with his, to me, strange claim that there can be factual claims about the internal (or that moral value is somehow external, I am not quite sure which).

I could be wrong, but it seems like what you are getting at is that you simply think that irreducibly normative relations are ""strange claim[s]"".

To quote a bit from one of ReallyNicole's summaries:

&gt; * The fact that my donating blood will save lives counts in favour of my donating blood.
* The fact that I can save a drowning child at minimal cost to myself counts in favour of my saving that child.

&gt;Olson contends that these moral favouring relations are unlike other cases in which we take ourselves to have a reason. For instance:

&gt; * The fact that rules of chess restrict bishops to diagonal motions counts in favour of my only moving my bishops diagonally.
* The fact that I desire to eat tuna counts in favour of my eating tuna.

&gt;In these more mundane sorts of reasons Olson argues that the favouring relations are reducible to facts about chess, my preferences for food, and so on. Or, more broadly, they are reducible to facts about an agent's desires, her roles, or various institutional norms that she submits herself to. The sort of reduction Olson has in mind is simply that normative claims of the reducible sort may be held to be true or false depending only on agent's desires/institutional roles and whether or not the act in question satisfies these desires/institutional roles. Moral imperatives admit of no such reduction (according to the robust realist anyway)...

To you, because ""[m]oral imperatives admit of no such reduction,"" moral imperatives are metaphysically queer, or as you put it, ""strange.""

It's not clear, however, that this means that they do not exist/can not have a value of true. To make this more compelling I would invoke Cuneo's (2007) argument. I'm not going to explain it all here ([perhaps this is a good summary](https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/23575-the-normative-web-an-argument-for-moral-realism/)), but the gist is that when we hold epistemic facts to be true, we are invoking the same kind of intrinsically motivating and irreducibly normative claims that we do when we hold moral facts to be true. Basically, when we expect everyone to have the same kind of knowledge (e.g. we expect everyone to know 1 + 1 = 2 in the same sort of way), the motivation for this *and* the fact that it is normative, is irreducible. Surely, the reason you have justified knowledge that 1 + 1 = 2 is not because you desire for it to be true or because the societal structures you live within suggest that you know it.

Moral and epistemic facts, therefore, are in company with one another, so if we decide that anything that is intrinsically motivating is metaphysically queer, we have to deny both moral *and* epistemic facts, you cannot choose one to keep. Surely, you have demonstrated that you take some epistemic facts to be true.

EDIT: Also, if you are willing to accept a healthy dose of theism, there is always Divine Command Theory, which states that moral facts have an origin, viz. they emanate from a deity (e.g. Elohim). Personally, however, I don't buy it.","1438387398"

"beards","t5_2qn08","&gt; My original point: there is conflicting evidence that sex-reassignment surgery is best.

There is conflicting evidence on basically any scientific question you can think of.  Crackpots abound, as do mistakes and outliers.  McHugh is retired, did not work in an area of psychology relevant to trans issues, is an outspoken anti-LGBT activist, and holds views about trans people that are radically different from the consensus in the field.  We shouldn't pay him any more attention on this subject than we do to the time cube guy on physics.

&gt; You did criticize the method first, then made a point of mentioning the age. Norms of how studies should be done do change to get more accurate results, but that doesn't mean in and of it's self that some changes in accuracy will change the result entirely.

In any given field, individual studies from before a certain point (typically a few decades ago) are only of historical interest.  Either they get superseded, or they get synthesised with other research and turned into review articles and textbooks, or they are abandoned as misguided or fruitless.  If somebody is citing research from the 70s for reasons other than providing historical context, it looks a bit suspicious.

&gt; The DSM-V part, if true, is kinda blatantly insurance fraud.

The APA have been very open that part of the reason for including gender dysphoria in the DSM-V is to ensure that people can get treatment, because insurance companies tend to want a specific, official diagnosis.  From [their website](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx):

&gt; According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), people who experience intense, persistent gender incongruence can be given the diagnosis of ""gender dysphoria."" Some contend that the diagnosis inappropriately pathologizes gender noncongruence and should be eliminated. **Others argue that it is essential to retain the diagnosis to ensure access to care.**

I really don't see how you could argue that this is insurance fraud.

&gt; gender identity disorder/gender dysphoria

They actually have different definitions - it wasn't merely a name change.  Trans people are only considered to have gender dysphoria if their gender identity causes them intense distress.","1438387403"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Less than 4% of people who EVER use marijuana will get addicted (and many debate it is even that high or even possible at all) yet it is VERY plentiful here(Actually it has the lowest addiction potential yet HIGHEST use of all banned drugs)  so it seems ""addiction"" is not a deciding issue on why it is available or not, it is simply econ 101 of supply and demand. Gangs want drugs and guns so the answer can not be to ban them as we have plenty of evidence prohibition doesn't work here and NEVER has.

End the war on drugs, improve health care and fix the wealth gap and gun crime will drop. But that is not easy to do so politicians (mostly Democrats) scramble to get the quick points and ban something instead of fix it (see my edit as to why this hurts us and is doomed to accomplish nothing at all). And history shows that doesn't work, so why are so many in support of repeating a failed idea?

Edit: Just to add, banning instead of fixing is DOOMED to fail. It has ZERO chance of working with firearms. The internet now allows you to order guns from anywhere in the world and technology is advancing so fast we can now 3D print guns at home. VERY SOON anyone will be able to print a quality gun at home using the internet to get the plans and if we have not FIXED the problem by then, banning will have NO affect on criminals(Imagine if people could 3D print drugs, do you really think a ban would have ANY affect? Get ready because this will soon be the reality for guns).

The problems HAVE to get legitimately solved because technology is about to make bans completely useless. And every politician that wasted time banning instead of fixing will have accomplished nothing but waisting our tax dollars.","1438387404"

"raisedbynarcissists","t5_2we9n","I really appreciate your reply. My therapists have told me in the past that part of the reason I don't see this as harmful is how much I push it away or something? Like, telling the generalities of this, I would have a very flat affect. Usually if I am asked to go into detail I kind of freak out and get really upset, so I can understand that someone would not be able to read through this.

Hearing these comments from you guys makes me feel sure that my bf is right. We are both trying to get my daughter and I out of this situation and he is pushing for me to go NC after that, but isn't trying to force me. He is insisting that our daughter is NC with them and honestly he is her parent, not my parents, and I have never seen him be anything but caring and loving towards her so I'm not really going to argue with him on that. My mom does try to guilt trip me about it a lot though. The stuff with my mom is honestly much harder than with my dad. I know my dad is a total dick. I don't like him and try to avoid him all the time. But for a long time I thought my mom was there for me, like that she was my friend and would help me. But recently when I brought up to her why she never helped me when I was being hurt by other people, she told me that I didn't tell her, or I wasn’t specific enough. I guess I really should be mad at her, but for now I think I just need to work on seeing her as equally toxic as my dad, since thats kind of what I am hearing from my bf and seems to be what I am hearing from you guys too. 

Anyways, if my post upset you I'm sorry. I can probably understand even if you don't read this comment but I just kind of felt like I needed to say this stuff ""out loud."" The first thing you had mentioned in your comment about my dad and my birth really has confused and upset me recently... After I had my daughter, my mom was trying to talk me out of having any contact with my bf, because he honestly is mentally ill (although he knows this, and works hard to change it). She brought up some abusive relationship she had with a schizophrenic guy before she met my dad. Previously she had told me how he had hit and raped her, but after my daughter was born she told me that she had gotten pregnant when she was with him and decided that now was the time to tell me she had had an abortion and broken up with him. I didn't really know how to take that and it still really freaks me out.

My daughter wasn't really planned, but I have always wanted children, especially a daughter. My boyfriend and I were so excited when we found out and we never have even thought about not wanting her for a second. The only regret I have is the crappy situation she is in now. I can't imagine doing what either of my parents have (I don't say this to take some kind of stance on what my mom did, I believe women should have a choice but she has told me various things about the rape and the abortion and i think the former happened after the latter. its hard to tell i think that she lies a lot). Like i have said before, I think that my little girl has just forced me to realize a lot of this stuff, because I just couldn't imagine doing any of the things my parents have done to me to my sweet little girl.","1438387404"

I've always realized that there is someone who would be happy to be in my shoes, and who has so many more problems than I do. It's part of the reason that I usually don't tell people about how I feel, or what's happening in my life. I feel guilty complaining about my problems after all the things I've heard about other people having to deal with. And yeah, bragging isn't something I'm interested in. If I volunteered, I'd keep it to myself. I don't really see the appeal in doing things just to change how people think about you. I don't care all that much about what people think of me. I care a lot more about how I feel, or make others feel. I like helping people. I love seeing people smile or be happy when they're around me. Volunteering would probably really help me, but I've never really thought about it for some reason. I'm definitely going to look into it more. And I live in the United States.

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","With sandbox the setting is key. Lots of detail. Mount Olympus has just collapsed into Tartarus? OK. But where the hell are we?

The more specific the starting location the easier for players to sandbox. For your part you'll need shit loads of NPC character names and notes on locations. Be prepared to fly by your britches.

But I do feel you're mixing player relevance with sandbox (and agency). It's entirely possible to play the most stringently guided railroad game while still ensuring players feel like they are in full command of their characters.

Think of it as a ven diagram. Two circles, overlapping. On one circle, player domain (the character, character's stats, character's background, character's likes and dislikes, his personality, his thoughts, his ambitions, his secrets and so on), on the other circle GM domain (the setting, the story, the plot twists, the NPCs, the GM's secret plot hooks and some juicy battles which will be introduced at some point). Unlike every other ven diagram, the two circles NEVER OVERLAP.

In other words, there is no situation where you get to tell a player what happens to his character without the player having a say. And similarly, the player never gets to invent his surroundings. Not to say the player can't *influence* his surroundings, or that you can't *affect* the fate of the player character, just that the two domains are mutually exclusive.

Moreover, the two circles are encompassed within the whole that is a non-competitive mutual entertainment exercise. Everyone has fun, not just the GM. Everyone gets to tell their story, be that the story of the setting and the plot or the story of the character background and motivation. Never underestimate how important the character is to a player. The character is their driving motive for playing, not your story, or their ability to affect change within your story. 

Once a GM gets that, he becomes Uber GM in the eyes of his players.","1438387405"

It's the game where you hack the game to win the game. Honestly, describing it is hard and makes it sound not fun. Just go play it.

Okay, so, basically, it's an ASCII-art puzzle game. There's a bunch of puzzle elements sitting around, and you have to get to the ⌂ at the end of the level. And these puzzle elements are in your way. BUT you have access to a Python REPL that lets you directly run code against the game world. You use this to solve the puzzles.

When it comes to the game of life, western women are not that great at that.  And if you are beta, western women, women in general can be your worst nightmare.

"Frugal","t5_2qhbe"," Not even close. The legal definition of a cord is a 128 cubic feet of wood. Normally represented by a 4x4x8 stack of wood.

I think you're thinking of ""face cords"", which there is no legal definition for. Though many people seem to still call face cords, cords for whatever reason

A face cord, from what I've seen from guys that actually try to sell wood by the 'face cord', is 4 feet high and 8 feet long, but only one row wide, how long the person cuts their wood would determine how much wood is actually in their face cord

Where as a legal cord, not a face cord, would be a stack 4ft high, 8 feet long and 3 rows wide at 16"" lengths. Or 2 rows wide at 24"" length etc. Obviously its not an exact science. I just had a trailer with a large enough volume where once it was full, it was a cord at least. For non stacked cords, they estimate about 180cu ft of wood volume needed to make a cord, to make up for air space, again not an exact science.

I think some areas have resorted to making it law that firewood has to be sold by weight, because of all the dishonest people in the firewood trade that give people a bad name. I can't even tell you how many people were completely surprised by how much wood a real 'cord' actually is, when I would show up with what seemed to be their first *real* cord.

If we're lookking at just the row of black walnut that we see in front, thats probably about half a cord. Lets say its 12 feet long, 4ft high and 18"" long splits, that'd be 72 cu.ft of wood.","1438387410"

&gt;     git rm -rf *

&gt;Massive mistake - now all my files are gone. 

Seems like maybe you have found an obscure flaw in Git's ""Do no harm"" approach. If you hadn't staged the files, Git wouldn't have deleted them.  If you hadn't used the ""force"" option, `-f`, with `git rm`, Git wouldn't have deleted them.  And since you had added but not yet committed the files, in effect, the ""previous version"" you might recover from Git using `checkout` (or whatever) is presumably just a null file.  You have apparently managed to unintentionally dodge through a number of safety checks and get Git to delete files that (presumably) it should have refused to delete.

If the files really are gone (and I kinda think they might be&amp;mdash;sorry), you might want to consider filing a bug report.  Call it ""unexpected behavior"".","1438387410"

Cover the supports with as much scotch as you can, and if it covers tiny pieces of the amiibo that you DO need to color, its ok! Just try to really carefully color them when you are done. Also, this is just some advice, color the support. The pieces behind the support will still be unpainted and might look a bit strange. And also even more advice, if you are trying to make a gold repaint, use gold spray paint. Careful procedure will save you lots and lots of time!","1438387412"

Well, that's one version of the story. The guardsman seemingly gets exchanged for something different every time GW rereleases the story.

If you get a CLC with a radiator the size of the Corsair H60, then you'll need 1 120mm fan and 3 140mm fans for the best use of the case. If you get a CLC with a radiator the size of the H100i, then you'll need 3 120mm fans and 1 140mm fan for optimum use of the fan areas.

The case comes with 2 120mm fans only. They're decent, but not the best. Also, CLCs usually come with fans, so remember that when you're looking at parts.

The online leagues have ended, so you won't see too many T1 matches. You might see some T2/T3 online matches, qualifiers for the next online season. As for events, 

there's Acer Predator Masters going on with a lot of T2 EU teams like Dignitas, MouseSports, SK, (new lineup with some players from former CWolves) and eFrag (GPlay) 

and 

there's an NA qualifier for the major coming tomorrow (the ESL matches) There was a huge NA shuffle early May, a few changes since then. By watching the qualifier you should get a good gauge on the T1 NA teams. Also, Cloud9 can actually compete with EU teams so that's cool :)

You probably don't recognize a lot of teams because there are a bunch of local lans on CSGL right now. The balkan one I have absolutely no idea about, I've never heard of almost all of the teams, and Assembly is a Norwegian LAN so those teams won't appear again (for a long time) aside from the polish team eBettle which got into the major.

There's a LAN coming up, Gamescom with an interesting format, coming in a week or so but otherwise CSGL should be quiet until the major coming August 20th iirc.

I hope I was helpful, ask me any questions you have! :D And like the others said, follow the scene for a while before betting again. That might be hard to some extent though, as there aren't any big events until the major","1438387417"

Now, down to business.  You asked quite a few questions.
 
&gt;She is a great partner that I am attracted to and I love her,

This sounds like a great start.
 
The definition of asexuality, in simplest terms, is a lack of sexual attraction.  So, when you say you are attracted to your wife, what do you mean?
 
Yes or no.  Do you feel sexual attraction?  Have you ever?
 
&gt;I feel like it is selfish of me to never or rarely have sex with my wife, so I force myself to do it once a week or every couple of weeks(since she wants it every night). Is this standard?
 
There is no such thing as standard.  It sounds like you've found a compromise which, from your tone, seems to work for both of you.  Congratulations.
 
&gt;Do other men take testosterone vitamins ot similar supplements? Should I use something like viagra?
 
Are your testosterone levels low?  Do you have difficulty achieving or sustaining erections?
 
Those are not magical romance medicines...they treat specific deficiencies and problems.  Do you have any of those problems?  
 
&gt;I thought something was wrong with me medically. Im so relieved to see that there are other people who feel the same as me.
 
Well, yes, theoretically there could be something wrong with you.  Pseudo-asexuality is a side effect of some medications, etc.

Cons are :

LMG are sort of suited to just sit there and camp. M249 is the better one.

RPK just needs honest recoil. ALso, sway is bigger if you carry more weight im pretty sure even when 100% stamina. If it is the fact, then this could be changed as well. Otherwise LMG would be fair trade of + and - if perhaps not this/these reason/s.

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","My best friend from high school was incredibly religious.

To be fair, so was I. He was a year older than me, so when he went to a religious college during my senior year, I was happy for him. Then I went to a military college (not exactly the most liberal place) and the small cracks I'd always had but ignored in my faith started to show and grow. I saw his school for the insular hole that it was, but never breached the topic with him. Because my deconversion was slow, and I didn't want to be rude.

For a while, I thought we were just growing apart because of the distance. But... That really wasn't it. His faith deepened to uncomfortable levels while I became more if a deist. He dropped out of his college and leeched off our old church (one of those feel-good, guitar-band churches with a southern bent), which was rising in the area.

What really broke it was when I figured out evolution was a real thing. I'd never really read up on it before; I'd just accepted what my creationist friends and their families had told me. But when I started reading... It made sense.    
So I posted a picture of one of those horrifying creationist ""quizzes"" a school had given to elementary school children and said that it was horrifying how children were being subjected to this. I empathized with them, since I'd been told the same.

Boom, my Facebook exploded. My (former) best friend's older brother started insulting me, dropping grammatically-questionable Behe bombs about intelligent design and godless liberals and so on, with my former best friend as his hype man.     I spent a whole day digging through Google and responding as politely as possible that they were full of shit. It was about the point where they insinuated that my college education was part of my ""falling away"" and that hopefully I'd ""come back to the fold"" where I realized I had no reason to entertain them any more. If our history didn't matter to them, then it no longer mattered to me.

He still messages me every now and then, but since I don't go home much any more it's easy to avoid him and his family. Which, in retrospect, I should have done earlier. They had *huge* problems, partially stemming from their dad's fundamentalism. This is the man who told me that the Bible had no contradictions and was utterly perfect.

I'm not saying that religion is the core of their problems, but it definitely enabled them. It's part of why I'm so distrustful of religion now.

Here is a thread made 2 months ago, it shows what people think of the narrative of me3 up till today. Most of the views were pretty much the same as when the game first released. 

&gt; my friend had said that the EC ""made it better by far.""

I think we can both agree that your friend was wrong. Back when people first experienced the ending, some people deluded themselves into thinking Bioware made the ending bad on purpose and would release a paid dlc to complete the ending to fit the indoctrination theory. It's a fan theory that says when harbinger hits the beam at shepard, he's actually trying to indoctrinate shepard, and everything you see/hear when you go up the beam is in shepard's head. The arguement with illusive man and anderson is shepard's conciousness fighting between right and wrong, and the catalyst is also a part of the ""dream"". People were thinking that Bioware would release a dlc that followed this and would have shepard ""waking up"" on earth to continue the fight. It was just a huge circle, then the extended cut released, and people say that Bioware just messed up badly.

Like, the saying was, the orignal ending was ""shit"" and the extended cut is ""shit with sprinkles""","1438387424"

Version A, tier one pricing. Some items are available and all need to be unlocked.

Version B, tier two pricing. More items to pick from the options pool, all items come unlocked instead of having to be earned and different game mode.

Seriously though, this is a fantastic list that really covers all areas that most men should either really know or learn. Especially if you're spinning plates or secretly having some side action if you're in a LTR and want to avoid conflict and unnecessary drama. Women for the most part are pretty retarded and can't figure out how to take their car out of park half the time but they can become CIA agents when they want to. When a woman becomes emotional, there's no limit or line they will not cross in order to get what they want and they will exhaust any and every means to do so. That's what makes them so dangerous to begin with.

Every man I have ever talked too who was either cheating on his wife for years (never got caught) or spent majority of his life spinning plates (Alpha Dudes) always, always, would refer to basically everything on this list in some format or another. ","1438387425"

[**20**] But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge. [**21**] I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth. [**22**] Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son. [**23**] No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also. [**24**] Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father. [**25**] And this is the promise that he made to us—eternal life.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","Always complete a [Change of Address for Texas Vehicle Registration](http://www.txdmv.gov/forms) every time you move so 1) the appropriate county knows where to send your registration documents and 2) if you go through the toll booth anywhere in Texas they send the bill to the correct address.

Also, if it's for the 45 toll road, if you call them or go to the office to pay, ask for your account number.  From there you can log into their web site and provide an email address.  You will receive emailed bills from that toll company only from there on out thus saving the admin cost of mailing the statement.  183A does not do this (or didn't long ago) and also charges an insane amount if you miss your toll payment deadline whereas 45's missed payment fee is much less.  I refused to take 183A for many, many years because I was so angry over their practices of that plus not mailing initial statements (only late statements).

I vividly remember that CNET tried to do the same at the time. You know what they learned? No one wants to have to watch video.

The push even today by so many to make news, product demos, startup intros, etc. video only serves to remind me how poorly we learn from our own history.  

Producers and advertisers think video tells a better story and that it can be better monetized. What they fail to appreciate is thay the internet isn't passive entertainment! It's not TV. I want to search, skim, and copy content.  I consume the internet in public and can't always listen! If you make me watch even 30 seconds of video without a complete written version, I put a hex you for being a moron and believing that people want video on the Web. ","1438387432"

"SoccerBetting","t5_2r4wz","I did this last year and had costa, so got some money back and a fair amount of free bets across the season.  I'd just check the odds elsewhere before putting it on with paddy for the free £2 bet, as I dont think I won any money from them.  Plus the usual average for them to be top goalscorer is 20 goals, so £40 in free bets across the season I'd do a quick check and work out if with the better odds it's better waiting till the the end of the season for any return.

 2. What state are you in, California?
 3. They told you last week about a $25 increase, but when does that increase start?
 4. What kind of lease do you have?
 5. Why do you have to give them 60 days notice? Is that in your lease? Is it a local/state law? Is that what they told you?
 6. (assuming California):If you are on an annual lease, your rent is stable for the period of that lease. They can raise it when you renew(30 days notice for &lt;=10%, 60 days notice for &gt;10%). Technically if you're on a month-to-month lease they could raise it every month. Not saying it doesn't suck, but those are the terms. 

Can you switch to a month-to-month rental in the same place? Most of the longer leases(6-month/12-month) I've had, default to month-to-month after they end. Sometimes you might pay more for a month-to-month lease, but if you're looking to relocate or reduce your rent long term, that gives you the freedom to look around, without having to time it right when your lease ends. Now that your lease is coming up, ask if you can be month-to-month.

Stop worrying, start thinking. I love where I live, but I'm always keeping my eye on the rental market. It gives you a feel for what you can get, and when the best time of year to move is. In Southern California, that tends to be late fall to early winter. There seem to be less properties available, but significantly less potential renters hunting for places to live. This means less competition and lower prices. Also, I imagine most families don't want to move mid school year.

Try to save up some money for a security deposit. Moving is never cheap, but it's easier if you've squirreled away the money for initial expenses.

"RocketLeague","t5_30cz1","I just remembered why I started playing goalie in the first place which I think is an interesting enough thought to add to the conversation. I thought it'd be nice if I didn't always have to play both defence and attack at the same time since then I don't seem to be able to focus properly on either, and nobody seems to ever dedicate themselves to defence. So I decided to try and be the change I wanted to see in the world.  
Someone even thanked me for it, saying how nice it was to have a dedicated goalie, so I thought I was doing something pretty good too. 

Now I play attack with a ""defence"" switch, where rather than half-arsing defence and attack I will - when the situation calls for it - switch to ""defence"" mode and go full on goalie for as long as I feel necessary, then flip back to attack. I like it a lot more that way.","1438387435"

Okay, but as opposed to what? Inflating labor costs just reduces the demand for unskilled labor, making it more difficult for them to find jobs and more likely to lose what jobs they already had, and even those of them who maintain employment don't actually end up in a better position than they would have been in by receiving government aid directly. It sounds like you're prioritizing getting ""revenge"" against capitalists more highly than actually making life better for workers.

I also don't know how you figure that being dependent on government aid via inflated labor costs makes one any more ""self-sufficient"" than they would have been by receiving government aid directly. ""So long as your money comes from the hand of the capitalist, you are independent""? I don't think that's how that works.","1438387436"

"ParkRangers","t5_2v64q","It really sounds like you have a good thing going there. I have met people who have made the switch and it worked out well, but those stories are few and far in between. 

As you were saying, the big issues in the NPS include, lack of benefits, lower pay than most state agencies, and certainly a lack of stability. They can pretty much just let anyone go whenever it suits the needs of the park. However, I do love getting to travel around the country. I love the adventure. Too many of my friends are stuck in boring office jobs. They are nice and stable, good pay, benefits, etc. But they hate it. I always feel like I have the best deal around.

I wouldn't give up on the idea of the NPS. Here's something to consider. If you do reach that management level in the state parks, it makes you much more hire-able to a permanent or term position in the NPS. One of the head honchos at my park spent a career in the state parks and came over as a permanent NPS employee. He has managed to work at five or six different parks. Even many of the perm employees I work with tend to jump parks quite a bit. 

Another thing to consider is the NPS as a retirement job. I've met several semi-retired rangers in the NPS. They made a career in state parks, or something similar and then came to the NPS to do seasonal work when retired or close to it. They get all of the fun of traveling around and only needing to work six months out of the year.

For now it sounds like you have a good situation in the state parks. But the NPS will always be there. You've got options.","1438387438"

A case could be made that the bad writing quality reflects on a lack of enthusiasm for the student.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","It depends on how you are calculating the calories burned through exercise. MFP calculations tend to over-estimate calories burned, so a lot of us make it a practice to eat back about half of our exercise calories.

Sometimes I see someone saying they don't eat their exercise calories back. I don't recommend that - if you consistently eat at too much of a deficit, your body isn't shy about taking what it needs from muscle, including your heart. That's a dire situation, but I'm just putting it out there to emphasize that in order to lose weight safely, take your recommended calories per day and your exercise burn into account and eat enough to be sure you aren't depriving yourself of important nutrition.

Exercise is wonderful for so many reasons - and one of those reasons is that those extra calories burned allow me to relax and enjoy an occasional serving of Talenti Caramel Apple Pie gelato while still losing weight ;)","1438387446"

Keep in mind they have stated that they want to alleviate some of the pains of taming times. Kibble being the first part of it.

I mean we've already tamed a 116 and 120 rex with full kibble since 4.0 came out and I just did a 120 sabre in less than 30 min like 20 min to me posting this.
I actually think taming is fine as is with the new mechanics that they plan on introducing in the near future.

Also unsure about the season system. It could be fun, but it's also incredibly frustrating for those of us who have put in the hours to farm. I understand there is a power curve and new players have it a little rough... But I don't know if wiping every couple months is a solution. 

As for making wild dinos more dangerous I am all for that. Especially considering some of the stats for the dinos we have.


EDIT: Also 191 is out George, save us George-wan Kenobi you're our only saviour.

Instead the nightmare animatronics seem to be modifications of the withered animatronics from Five Nights 2. This is a major problem with MatPat's timeline that throws almost all of his conclusions about the situation into question.

It's also strange that this bite which was perpetrated by four punk kids would cause the animatronics, who are shown at this point to be the Springlock suits and what might be fixed installations, to have their movement restricted during daytime, when we have no evidence from this game that there were any roaming animatronics.

Further the advertisement, isn't ""Freddy Fazbear's Pizza"" it's ""Fredbear and Friends"" meaning it can't be concurrent with the second game which took place in 1987.

All of this combines to the conclusion that the information we get about the bite of 1987, doesn't apply in this situation, because it's not that situation.","1438387450"

"RealEstate","t5_2qipl","I'm not an expert but it seems very very very unlikely anyone would considering giving you a mortgage under those circumstances. I don't mean to bash your dreams, just trying to be realistic. 

For a $750k house, the standard is 20% down, which is $150k. You have $50k which is about 7%. With such a low down payment, your mortgage payment will be over $3k AND you have to pay property tax which will probably be close to another $1k so you're looking at minimum monthly payment of over $4k a month, which comes out to $48k a year. And that doesn't include any additional expenses such as insurance, any repairs/maintenance etc

You said you have a combined annual salary of $59k. That leaves you with $11k a year to live on.

I really cant imagine any bank willing to lend to you under those set of numbers.

I lived in the LA area for almost 20 years so i know the pricing there can be expensive. But I also know you find some modest homes in ok neighborhoods for much less then $750k - you should be able to find something, maybe a bit small, for $300k in some area. If you are dead set on getting a house, look for one outside of whatever area you are currently looking in and I would look at some that need some fixing up, assuming you don't mind getting a little dirty and putting some work into the house.

I totally understand not wanting to relocate - but socal is a pretty big area. You should at least consider moving a tiny bit further away into a neighborhood with lower priced houses/rent.

Just remember there's more then just the mortgage payment - you have to pay property taxes along with the general maintenance of the house - something breaks you have to pay for it not the landlord. Well, i guess technically the landlord does have to pay for it, except the landlord is you.

Good luck","1438387451"

I never said that, I said that its more trustworthy than a COMEDY show.

&gt;Yes. And the same goes for American ""news"" organizations... with the difference that their job isn't to make you laugh. Their job is to spread propaganda while pretending to be serious and objective.

They do try, within their own narrative.

&gt;Yes. Which makes him more trustworthy. You can trust him more because he isn't trying to hide anything.
To educated and intelligent people it is obvious that news shows are biased, too. They just don't say they are. Which is why they are less trustworthy.
Do you really not understand the meaning of the word trustworthy?

I can trust someone for information when he is overtly biased? Notice the leap in logic there?

&gt;This isn't about watching a comedy show for information. 

Yes actually it is, you should never be watching a comedy show for anything but laughing.

&gt;This is about finding American comedy shows more trustworthy than American ""news"" media. Which is a good thing, because you can't in any way whatsoever trust American news media.

I can't in anyway? Oh brother.

&gt;I can't believe people are actually watching American news shows for information in the real world... yet here you are.

Your implication here is that being secular and pro-life is somehow hypocritical or oxymoronic, which is quite ridiculous from a philosophical point of view.

You know what abortion was like in pre-modern societies? Do you know your history?

I'll tell you. It was a tool, along with infanticide, used by the patriarchs in families and societies to control reproduction and population. Women didn't choose to get abortions, they were forced upon them by their fathers, brothers, and husbands. For this reason, most early feminists were anti-abortion.

Pro-choice feminism would not emerge until the early 20th century, and it would not be until the mid-late 20th century that the feminist movement as a whole got in bed with the pro-choice movement. Some dissident feminist groups still oppose abortion to this very day.","1438387454"

Prostitutes in ancient Rome waited for their customers out of the rain under vaulted ceilings,[3] and the Latin word for vaults, fornix, became a euphemism for brothels, and the Latin verb fornicare referred to a man visiting a brothel.[4][5][6] The first recorded use in English is in the Cursor Mundi, c. 1300; the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) records a figurative use as well: ""The forsaking of God for idols"".[7]


Fornicated as an adjective is still used in botany, meaning ""arched"" or ""bending over"" (as in a leaf). John Milton plays on the double meaning of the word in The Reason of Church-Government Urged against Prelaty (1642): ""[She] gives up her body to a mercenary whordome under those fornicated [ar]ches which she cals Gods house.""[8]

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","That's the biggest factor, certainly, but there's another within families.  It's that if you change too much, they have trouble consolidating the version of you that's in their head and the one they see.  In other words, they're afraid they won't recognize you both physically and emotionally as the same person.  And to be fair, that's essentially true.  

Like seeing a glasses-wearing friend who got eye surgery.  It takes a while to see their new face as the friend you've always known.  But that's just a physical change.  This is a greater effect, because you really do change, both inside and out.  As far as parents go, it's an even greater challenge, because you're telling them that what they taught you isn't good enough.  Give them time and power through it.  They'll see you for who you are eventually.  The sisters compliment you because it's still a shock to them when they see you.  Your mom is just being a mom, trying to get what she knows you like and ignoring what you say.  Your dad is just mentioning what he's thinking.  They'll all get over it in time.

Bad: I got my test results back and I have Antiphospholipid Syndrome.  Because of other symptoms I have a consult with a rheumatologist for additional testing.  A few year ago I had several health problems including some abnormal autoimmune tests.  At the time my doctor essentially said there was a 1/3 chance that it would go away, a 1/3 chance it would end up as a lupus diagnosis, and a 1/3 chance it would be something else autoimmune - but that it could take years to figure out.

"sverigedemokraterna","t5_2tug9","Problemet är att din fråga är för bred för att besvaras i en enda kommentar, men eftersom du verkar genuint nyfiken kan jag ta upp mina huvudskäl:

**1)** Invandring: Dels tar Sverige in för många invandrare för att vi ska kunna upprätthålla vår egen kultur och klara av bostadssituationen. Dels sätter vi en för låg ribba för vilka som tillåts invandra vilket förvärrar läget på arbetsmarknaden och gör våra gator mindre trygga. Vi måste sänka invandringen till den nivå som våra grannländer har och kanske ännu lägre, och framförallt måste vi sätta vårt eget lands väl i fokus. Ska hjälp ges till andra länder ska det ske på plats i krisdrabbade områden.

**2)** Försvar: Sverige har ett försvar som själva uppger att de bara kan försvara särskilda platser under en eller två veckor ifall ett krig inträffar. För att säkra vårt land geopolitiskt och för att kunna upprätthålla vår alliansfrihet måste vi genomföra en kraftig upprustning av försvaret. 

**3)** Skolan: Den svenska skolan genomsyras av brist på respekt och auktoritet och det är i praktiken eleverna som styr klassrummen (ofta de mest fysiskt aggressiva eleverna). Andra partier vill fortsätta den utveckling vi hittills haft, det som kritiker kallar för flumskola. Vi måste återinföra den så kallade kunskapsskolan där lärarna styr klassrummen och där eleverna lär sig genom disciplin och faktabaserad kunskap.

**4)** Rättsväsende: Det svenska rättsväsendet präglas av mjukhet och passivitet; vårt samhälle klarar inte av att sätta ner foten mot människor som skadar samhället. Vi behöver förbättra polisens handlingsförmåga och skärpa straffen för grova våldsbrott.

**5)** EU: Allt mer makt flyttas från Sverige till EU och minskar det svenska folkets förmåga att bestämma sitt eget öde. Svenskarna ska vara stolta och lyckliga över att de röstade nej till euron och vi behöver gå vidare och ytterligare minska EU:s inflytande i Sverige och öka landets självbestämmande.

SD är det enda parti som håller med mig på dessa punkter och därför är jag sverigedemokrat.","1438387462"

Over time, finding this kind of stuff began effecting a significant change in me. It's tough to process, but when you do, it gives a powerful external validation. That you aren't the only person to know what that is like. That people recognize how much it sucks. That, even if you suspect it be an unconscious or unwitting behavior, that doesn't make it suck any less.  

The more I understand the mechanisms that were used to hurt me, the easier it becomes to pity the people still trapped in them, and the easier it is to let go of the hurt. It feels like I spent half my life hunched over, and finally realized I could stand up tall too, like everyone else does...

"community","t5_2qu49","1. Chevy Chase became increasingly frustrated with his lack of screen time. He felt that the writing for his character was suffering and that Pierce's lines had become unfunny and overly-racist. He also was tired of spending long hours on set and having to shoot in LA for weeks at a time when he lives in New York.

1. Donald Glover wanted to take some time off from acting to further his music career as Childish Gambino. Anybody correct me if I'm wrong, but he also wasn't sure when or if he wanted to return to the show, which is why Troy's send-off has no real sense of finality.

2. Having Chang become a student was originally a way to keep the amount of interaction he had with the group up after they had stopped taking Spanish class. Ken Jeong's busy schedule in 2010 meant that he ended up being unable to appear for very long in many episodes of Season 2. Truthfully, all of his major character arcs come across as the writers trying to keep his character fresh and relevant to the group. I don't think he's specifically meant to be hated, but it's very hard to keep a character like Chang compelling because you run the risk of making him either too crazy or too flat.

I'll leave someone else to answer some more. :P","1438387466"

"greygoo","t5_30x6r","I bought the game for $60 with very high hopes a while ago, when it first became available.

I ended up keeping a spreadsheet of issues I ran into.
Some of these things may have been fixed by now, but I just tried playing the game today with a friend and it still wasn't a fun experience.

* Maximum game size is 4. 2 v 2. Kind of piss poor right off the bat.
* Repair tool is too sticky. If i click and drag, it should cancel the repair tool and begin selection.
* Performance issues even on low. I have a great computer.
* Menus are slow and laggy.
* There's confusion on building with the 'auto build' function. Not clear enough.
* Nothing more annoying than having an army secure for an expo, build a refinery, move army to defend this spot. Realize you can't build extractor. You have to then cancel the extractor. Select one unit, move it, wait for it to arrive, and then reselect Refinery, and then place it.
* Cannot drag-move on mini-map while in repair mode.
* Can't change middle-mouse button to 'drag-move screen' instead. Who cares about rotating the 3d view? It's 2015, we're over that. 
* Graphics aren't very clear. The whole game isn't very clear.
* Music timing. Horrible, 1 unit attacks a wall and epic music starts, I kill it, and music stops. It seems to be the same song, too. I'm already sick of some of the music, and I've played for a few minutes...
* Units (at least for Beta) seem like they all look the same too.
* Factories should indicate what they're building with a nifty little icon.
* The game lacks charm. As lots of people have been saying, the units seem so generic.
* Constant voice notifications... ""unit ready, unit in production..."" all game.
* Generally feels sluggish.
* Some missions take too long... I spent 20 minutes chasing characterless blobs in Singleplayer.
* The name is terrible, but you know that already. With such a wacky name i expected more charm in this game.
* Beta's supply cap seems to be reached pretty easy, even with units purely used for defensive purposes. Guardians take up space for defense that other races get for 'free' with turrets.
* Cannot see if a unit is selected while it is in the brush.
* The game should show hotkeys on hover.
* The way the patrol queue works is kind of bad.
* Multiplayer games against Goo ends up taking forever to find just that last one. And considering how the Mother Goo can both multiply and hide anywhere on the map, this makes it frustrating.
* Artillery units (especially the ones on the Goo side) are extremely frustrating to play against. Really? A huge-range artillery splash damage unit that can hide in unreachable terrain? Horrible, horrible design decision.



Again, I really wanted to love this game. The things above may seem nit picky but in the end it comes down to the game being slow, uninteresting, and hard to look at. I still have high hopes for this company's next game.","1438387467"

It can be very, very worth it to have human players in your world, as the DPS they can bring to the fight negates the first two downsides.

With the computer-controlled phantoms, it varies. For the most part, the phantoms you find in the main game (not the DLC areas) will be able to contribute a lot of damage to the fight, and it's worth having them around. There are a few exceptions. In the DLC areas, the phantoms you can summon are universally awful - they do next to no damage, and only serve to make the boss fights more difficult.","1438387468"

At the same time, every once in awhile I have to tell her what is on my mind.  I worry so much I physically get sick.  My stomach gets turned up side down and I can't sleep.

I used to be a lot worse.  I'm guessing like what you are currently dealing with.  The only advice I can give, is don't try to hide guys from him.  That will just make him more paranoid.  I honestly don't know what else to tell you.  My wife talks about other guys that I don't get jealous at all about.  I don't know why.   Maybe talk about the guy/s every once in awhile and be sure to throw in there if that guy made you mad, or were acting stupid or something to show your bf that the guy can get on your nerves sometimes.  Idk if that's true or not, but basically not painting a 'this guy is a perfect friend' type of picture I think helps.  

I really feel for you...  I know it's not easy being with a jealous type like myself.  If you have any more specific questions, let me know and I'll try to let you know a little more about how my psyche works.

...one other thing I just thought of.  Your friends may also play a role in how he feels about trusting you.  If you're hanging out with party girls or 'loose' women, that's not exactly going to reflect well on you.  I had to tell my wife that I was not cool with one of her friends that had obvious issues with men.  Dating guys twice her age and cheating on her husband.  Those aren't people I want in our lives.

Heyman was a way to refer to noblemen. I'm not a great history buff, but that's what I understand.

Man is older than the word hey. Man comes from the word [Manu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manu_%28Hinduism%29). Hey comes from the word [Hei](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hey) which is variation of a latin and yiddish. Hei is the expression of excitement in Middle English.","1438387469"

Age: 50

Year Born: 2910

Gender: Male

Eye Colour: Brown

Hair Colour: Grey

Skills: Storytelling, Tailoring, Gardening

Home Area: West Farthing

Tom is an old, and well to do Hobbit. He is the best tailor in West Farthing, if not the Shire itself, in his own not so humble opinion. Tom's hobbit hole is a small, but well to do affair, with the usual well stocked kitchen, and although it might not be as fancy as that Mr Bilbo's hole, well, we can't all be dashing o'er hill and dale to go traipsing with elves and dwarves. Not to say Mr Bilbo is a trouble maker, no, he's a good man so he is, always had a kind word for dear old Tom.

Tom takes much pride in his gardening, and while he'll be the first to admit he ain't no Gaffer, his garden still earns a few looks every now and then, with its well pruned apple tree, and flowers set in their patterns. He also is a very skilled storyteller, and as soon as Tom takes up his usual stool in the Green Dragon, he'll have a small group gather as he begins relaying off one of his tales, of far off adventures, or some even closer to home. He always knows how to play his audience, and when Mr Bilbo gets overworked by it all, Tom will sometimes step in, and he might well be the cause of some of the wilder tales circling about Baggins.

Tom is single, never having settled down in his life, although he always makes sure to take a big basket of vegetables to his ma and pa.","1438387470"

Even though it's Friday and I want to stay up and play video games I can hear my bed calling me now. 

I figure it's just my body's way of getting me to shut down so that it can work on on repairing the damage I did to it. I'm actually just incredibly relieved that I can sleep again. The first two weeks were a living nightmare. Now that I can sleep I feel content and much more in control of cravings. It's the first time I've had restful, restorative sleep in a long time.

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","Where do I start?

1. Even if I wasn't sexually attracted to them, I was orbiting them without wanting to. I noticed that they use male attention -from any male- to pose against other women. ""I don't have to give this guy my pussy and he still talks to me. That'll show Jessica/Miriam/Alice! etc"".

2. They want someone's shoulder to cry on. 

3. Crabbuckit. They didn't want me to succeed. If I was getting better than them, being happier, etc., they had to pull me down. 

4. I realized they're not very interesting. They drink. That's it. They don't have inspirations. They don't have strong opinions about much except celebs and gossip.

5. Like point 1, I was just a utility. I remember meeting some female friends at a pub before hitting the club and wanting to go home after a few beers because I was bored. They didn't want me to leave. But not because they liked me for me- because ""who is going to watch out for us?"". Whoa. Didn't realize it was my job to make sure creeps don't hit on you ladies. How much are you guys paying me for this wonderful privilege? 

6. ""Drama"". I don't care what Jessica's grandma's hairdresser said about Miriam's friend's dog. I don't. 

Some of these things I even realized before TRP, but I had a lot of pent up anger because they didn't match up to be what I wished them to be. Believe me, I hated them. Now? I realize they're women. I don't get angry at a dog for barking every time a car drives by my house...But I can choose not to buy a dog and get a cat instead. I keep female contact to a minimum of small talk or if I need something from them.

Not to say guy friends are fantastic - there's no shortages of pussy ass beta bitches out there. Make sure you avoid them adequately. Good male friends are a necessity against madness.","1438387479"

We're hurting after years of bad economic policy that has caused a decade without growth.  The income taxes aren't there because the income isn't there.  

Some combination of tax hikes and spending cuts are necessary, for sure.  But without robust economic growth, we don't have a chance.  We cannot borrow or print the many trillions of dollars we're going to need in the next 20 years.  ","1438387479"

"NewOrleans","t5_2qhp5","Fun Arcade gradually declined along with video arcades in general. Pinball machines started getting switched out for video ones, new games stopped pouring in, and I'm guessing the post-Katrina population was too small to keep it going.

I *think* Game Club folded just prior to Katrina, or it may not have resumed operations following the storm. I just remember passing by in the following weeks and never seeing it open. It was a shame, too, because that place was stocked well.

Yeah, Laser Tag is the best available today. Still not a good arcade in the classic sense; but it's affordable, offers some decent variety, and is well maintained. Too bad so many new machines are glorified smartphone games. I wish ""laser bowling"" was cheaper, too.

It's been a while since I've swung by Dibbz, but I know the few arcade machines there were not functioning on my last couple of visits, so I stopped going. That place is mostly a LAN center anyway, so I don't think it counts.","1438387479"

Everything outside of the premise seemed poorly executed, though. The plot was fairly predictable, the characters were cliched, and the overall tone of the book have me the impression that the author was just trying to showcase his own skills in trivia and retro knowledge.

I normally help my friends get their 5-7 kills, when I do that I normally get a bulk of the kills, 12+ most games. You have too really lead, and sometimes use them as decoys. If I'm being chased by a shotgun blinker and I'm low I will pick someone up, while they are killed again I secure the kill. What they lack in skill they can make up as well in communication, and supporting you secure kills and overwhelm the team.

With others of /r/fireteams I tend to play more supportive, I love sniping so I can stay a bit back, watch orbs since I can res snipe pretty consistently. Tailoring your game play, and just being smart has helped me a huge amount.

I'm by no means great yet, but I go flawless most weeks, and my KD is now 1.12.","1438387485"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","True enough

Protips (the vast majority of my friends being women), at the risk of sounding like a giggolo:

- Women generally go for the emotional route, either sexually or with intimate (admittedly friendzone) friendships. They don't like to be objectified anymore than men do.
- Talk &amp; listen. Especially listen and empathize. That goes a long way (both ways, I might add).
- Don't be afraid to be vulnerable. Actually, many women find that quite attractive &amp; sexy. You really don't have to be ""tough"" to be manly *(edit: if you want quality rather than quantity)*.
- Likewise, don't get caught up with your (socially expected) tough guy mask.
- Feel free to speak your mind. Don't be afraid of showing emotion, or a socially less-accepted opinion (you'll have to defend it though).
- Respect women for who they are. They're not sex objects but real personalities. They're just like you and me, with the same insecurities and whatnot that I mentioned earlier.

You know what, regarding that friendzone thing - women are much more mature when it comes to friendly relationships. Men somehow always tend to see the women in their social circles as potential sex objects, whereas women see those men just for what they are: friends. I never understood that dynamic. Hence, I get along with women just fine, and I really get a lot of social energy from them (and hopefully they from me).","1438387489"

The archetypical example of the latter factor is lending your family member with whom you live $20; it is clearly not contemplated as a legally enforceable loan.

Of course it is still possible for the loan to be legally binding, and that would be more readily inferred when the dollar figures are this high, but it would be an issue.

It seems strange that you basically have to do all of these little tasks which could easily be done by anyone else, even before you are inquisitor.

I think I would have liked it if, instead of getting quests direct from needy people by charging up to them so they can tell you their life stories, people instead delivered requests for help at Inquisition camps, and the Inquisitor got to go down the list of brief descriptions, pick out what looked interesting, and follow up with the NPC later.  Sort of like the Chantry boards in DA:O, you don't randomly trip and fall into sidequests, your growing organization is receiving pleas for help and you, the leader, can deliberately select whichever you feel is worth your valuable time.  Also if the ways of handling quests were more realistic than the Inquisitor stomping out to run minor errands like a peon.  Like, assign some scouts to get the refugees food, and the Inquisitor's job is just to close the rifts and slay the bandits blocking the way to decent hunting grounds.

Scroll down to,

&gt;Doesn’t the most recent Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) allow Roger Goodell to be completely unfair, given his role of investigator, judge and appellate judge?

-

&gt;[...] The powers that the commissioner has are not new. These were in the previous CBAs. It appears as though after the CBA was finalized, Goodell has substantially increased punishments in ways that the NFLPA likely did not contemplate. The Bountygate mess is the first example of that in 2012.

&gt;That said, the NFLPA is not arguing that the CBA process is unfair but rather that the NFL failed to follow the CBA and NFL rules as they are written and understood under labor law.

&gt;Businesses and unions negotiate CBAs to have a common understanding of their business arrangements. Every single situation can’t be baked into a these agreements, so labor law fills in the blanks for when disputes happen. Labor law is a very specialized area of the law, and the labor law involving sports and the NFL is even more specialized.

&gt;To simplify, the NFLPA makes the general argument that both the fairness procedures in the CBA and NFL rules and just basic “industrial due process” weren’t followed. That is, the NFLPA didn’t have to build in a lot of detailed technical fairness procedures into the document because all union members receive these protections under CBAs. Industrial due process is that bare minimum standards of due process that are allowed all disciplined employees in arbital proceedings.

&gt;As a part of this, the NFLPA argues that the NFL failed to follow “the law of the shop.” That is, that the NFL failed to follow the custom and practice that they’ve used in the past. [...]

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","Sorry, I'm not sure if I understand your question correctly so correct me if I'm wrong. There is a definite difference between hope and belief. I absolutely do not believe there is a god and I live my life as though there is not. And yet, I have great hope that there is something more beyond this life (while not believing that there is).

I would not say that hoping for something is religion. Religions tend to believe things that have no basis. That is where we get into trouble because when people turn hope into actual belief in a false (or unprovable) reality then they live their lives as though it's real. That leads to more trouble.

I love this quote from Karen Armstrong:

&gt; When you are willing to ignore the need for a rational basis for belief, you can be lead literally to believe anything, and since the rational basis is rejected out of hand - there can be no situation in which it occurs to you that your belief is incorrect.

I refuse to actually believe something without a rational basis. It's not just about doing what makes you feel better. People pass their baseless beliefs on to their children. People argue and fight and war over baseless beliefs. They are actually harmful. Right now, I have family members and friends that hold legitimate anger and hostility toward me because I disagree with their baseless beliefs.

However, hope is not belief. Hope for whatever makes you happy!","1438387495"

"YasoHigh","t5_32tb8","*Asahara made note of the sudden change in intensity. It would help him understand Arago a bit more, surely. Asa backed up towards the alley, and glanced at the rough corner of the building beside him. First, he swings the bat at it with all of his might behind it, which splinters it into two large pieces, with about 25 different small pieces scattered around. Asa flips what was left of the handle around, so that the butt was between his index finger and thumb.*

*As he gets a brass knuckle to the jaw, receiving a cut from it's pointed edge, Asa jerks his hand to the right, smacking the nose of the tire iron-user, and busting it painfully. He recoils in agony and drops the iron, holding his gushing nose. In the same moment, Asa punches the man with brass knuckles right in the gut, causing him to gasp and fall back, having lost his wind. Pitifully, he smacks his head on the edge of the sidewalk as he falls back, and conks out. There were only two left, both unarmed*

""Come on!""

*Like idiots, they go for a simultaneous cross to Asa's head, however, they miss as Asa ducks down and springs forward to one of them, like a coiled snake, knocking him over. Asahara beats on his face until he's begging for mercy, just in time to be kicked in the side of the head. If Arago had seen, and wanted to help, Asa would signal for him to stay*

**""You piece of shit. I'm gonna kill you, and your buddy!""**

*From his pocket, the man procures a flip-knife, which in Asa's overconfidence, is plunged right into his abdomen, causing Asa to gasp from the sharp pain. That almost psychotic grin he had was now gone. Asa firmly grabs the wrist of the man, who places his hand over Asa's, keeping the knife in as long as he can. Asa looks down, and, snarling like a rabid dog with every strike, pounds on the man's elbow from below, his arm striking out like a beast that had tensed it's entire body up. There is a crack after the third hit. The man backs away, screaming in anguish. His forearm was hanging down at an angle that would only be possible if his elbow was broken. Screaming, he runs off.*

""Yeah, bi-hah... bitch...!"" 

*Asa pulls the knife out of his abdomen and tosses it to the side, falling to his knees, panting. The adrenaline was quickly wearing off. Blood was dripping from his wound, saturating the already crimson shirt. He was lucky the guy with a knife was an idiot, and was unable to hit anything major. Asa puts his palms flat on the ground, sweat dripping off of his nose*

"Anxiety","t5_2qmij","Have you ever had something that you couldn't get off your mind?  Something you ruminated on?  Many times people can remember one or two experiences where they were essentially ""obsessed"" with something... it's kind of like that but ALL the time.  

For me, I can rationalize the things... I will question the crazy scenarios coming to mind but despite that they're not PLAUSIBLE, they're still POSSIBLE.  It's that possibility that makes it impossible for me to just ignore it.  I try to practice mindfulness and work to acknowledge and address the thoughts when they happen, but it just isn't that simple.  If we could just take a deep breath and tell ourselves to stop, please believe that we would.  That's all we want - to feel normal.  Not to be overwhelmed with thoughts that make no sense.  I catch myself thinking about driving into oncoming traffic or walking out into traffic - I know I wouldn't do these things - but there's basically no ""filter"" on my brain.  It comes up with ALL scenarios.  It's a very thorough process.  It is possible to eventually learn to minimize the thoughts and manage them- but for us, there's nothing that makes the brain slow down. 

Another way I found to explain it is this... I hope not to get too personal here - but I suffer from ADHD in addition to anxiety/depression.  A good example of how my brain functions is this... sometimes, when my boyfriend and I are being ""intimate"".. if a song I don't like comes on, I have to change it.  There is no way that I can NOT hear the song.  The lyrics pull my attention, regardless of what is happening.  There's one particular song that comes on one of the Spotify playlists I have saved and whenever it comes on, it reminds me of a former coworker I disliked and it drags me completely out of the ""moment"".  I have to change the song in order to get back into focus.  I don't have a way to ignore things that are going on around me.  From what I understand, this isn't the way most people's brains function.  My boyfriend rarely even NOTICES there's music playing, let alone the specifics of a song.  I also will think of things like ""am I putting too much weight on on him?"" or ""is he getting tired?"" ""is he ready for me to be done?"" ""is he bored?"" ""am I making weird faces?"" ""did I lock the front door?"" ""did I email back that person who asked me about such and such..."" - I don't want to think these thoughts - but it's like being punched in the face, you may not want to flinch when it happens, but it's just an involuntary action that you can't control.  The thoughts are involuntary actions that require TONS of effort to control.  After years of practicing, I'm still not great at it... I can at least open up to people and find that there are others that feel the same way and that knowledge has helped me more than anything. ","1438387498"

"Futurology","t5_2t7no","I agree with you that people choose to work in sweatshops because it is better than their other options. If you would re-read my first comment, you'd see that all I'm saying is that capitalism itself depends upon cheap labor. When their is no longer a supply of cheap labor, the system will have to change. I'm not calling capitalists evil. They, like their laborers, are simply making the most out of the conditions in which they find themselves.

If you read Das Kapital, you would realize how absurd it is to call it a simplification of anything. Perhaps you feel it is a simplification because your only experience with Marxist theory is the simplified version of it so many westerners use to reinforce their own world-views.

Marxism is a set of theories as to how capitalism works. It is a lens through which to view our world. He did not have everything right; none of us does. It is not a religion. A religion is a system of beliefs founded on supposed universal truths, much in the way that you base your opinions on what you call ""objective truth.""

Yes I dream of a better world. This does not mean that I am not in touch with reality. I understand that capitalism does a lot of great things for a lot of people. But in the pursuit of profit, capitalists are complicit in the inhumane treatment of human beings. Capitalism propagates societies in which those who have little must commit their time to those who have much. It is a relationship between humans entirely devoid of morality; all that matters is profit. That's a problem.","1438387498"

"news","t5_2qh3l","The motive for shooting. 

Typically you shoot to stop a threat. His reason for shooting was that he was being dragged by the car, that out his life in danger and so he shot to stop from getting dragged off.

Video doesn't support that story.

If he had said suspect was clearly inebriated and I shot  to prevent him from driving off under the influence at ""run from police"" speeds to prevent reckless danger to society or whatever that might be a better story.

If he shot him for not providing a license that's a terrible reason.

You and I can only speculate as to why. Lots of people think he suspected him of reaching for a gun when he made the sudden decision to drive off. But the officer himself hasn't provided that explanation.

The only thing the officer has said seems to be...not what I see on the video. So that makes it hard to support him even if you wanted to.

I think the bottom line is disobeying an officer is a good way to get killed. Which may or may not be murder, but that's for the survivors to worry about.

Depression and other forms of mental disorder can increase in intensity when they go untreated; they can be physically damaging or fatal, and even if they're not, the marks can persist forever. The worst case scenario if you go in to get help -- not being a Cornellian (or not owning a gun) seems fine by comparison.

If you believe that the things you are thinking and doing will cause Gannett to flip out and send you to the ER, then you probably need to go. If you're wrong, then there's no reason *not* to go. If Cornell is dumping students who are safe but not neurotypical, maybe they suck and you'll be happier somewhere else.

She ignores people and if she does show interest a quick ah! From me nips it in the bud. 

She also stays close by me and returns well when I call.

However, she is *super* dog friendly. If there's another dog around I no longer exist. So, I want to train her to not be a total jerk dog and run up to other's dogs since we  recently moved and don't have access to our empty trail anymore. 

Right now we haven't had problems. She stays on leash because I don't want her to go run and meet dogs, but I'd like to be able to unleash her and not have to worry. 

Is there a way to do this? Or, alternatively how can I keep her on leash and still get her exercise for when dog parks aren't an option. ","1438387499"

None of these things can really happen in a usable manner within a game, especially body language and communication with people who live in different time zones.  Instead we have to accept a lesser mechanic and have the game communicate this to us.  Also we have to accept that a more complex system would not be realistic with the available development team.

For example, if the shield breaks down anything moving too fast, use weighted bomblets in war-scale engagements.  On hitting the shield, the weighted section is destroyed, allowing the parachutes or other airbraking mechanisms to slow things down enough in that window to put an explosive inside the shield.  With sufficiently advanced detection, you could improve their effectiveness, or use drones (not banned due to no AI).  If it's just deflected, then it's weak to existing conventional explosives, through heavy shelling causing broken ground--or turning tight infantry formations into pinball machines, with the soldiers as bumpers.","1438387500"

The only real consistency is that PSG will spend whatever it needs to in order to keep itself on top of the pile in its domestic league, and with endless pockets compared to the other clubs in Ligue 1, theres nothing at all remarkable about it (On top of the fact that PSG didnt even earn its wealth, how long was it since they won their league before the sugar daddy came along?).

Everyone knows the competition in the EPL is far greater than that of Ligue 1, thats what makes it so enjoyable (aside from the wealth of talent on show from the top to the bottom of the table). Nobody is guaranteed to beat anybody else in such a tight and competitive league. Throw up all the stats you want about its predictability, there is a reason its the most marketable league in the world. 

Your right, there is something to consistency, so you can bring up Ligue 1 teams performances in the CL when they consistently do better than premier league teams. if you think English teams are weakening, i think you will be in for a surprise this year. 

If i compare the squads i would pick Uniteds so very easily, and the track record of the past 2 years is that of a club in major transition (the biggest transition any big club has made in my lifetime)and so its a poor measure of the actual quality.

You have your standard roundhouse where you bring the knee around from the back. Like a common roundhouse. 

Then there's the new school way. You bring the knee up like a front kick but turn your hips in at the same time. So instead of it coming around your hip, it's instant. You would think its not as powerful but the quick movement in the hip is where the power is generated from. This is old news in taekwondo but still has yet to be picked up in MMA. (I know how tkd is viewed as I also think it's useless in general) but that one basic kick is all you need. And Olympic level tkd competitors can throw it hard.

So I trekked to three separate Best Buys looking for both those things. Couldn't find them.  
Just now went to bestbuy.com and did a search for Thermal Paste. Four items. Did a 'in store pickup' search for each. All of them show 5-7 days, meaning they have none in the stores.

If it is UNSEALED:

1. Soak it for about an hour in hot water and dish soap.
2. Scrub with a bottle brush.
3. Rinse well
4. Using foil or a stand, prop up the horn and fill it with warm water.
5. Put two denture tablets into the horn
6. Let it sit overnight.
7. Rinse and scrub again.
8. Fill with cheap vodka and let it soak for at least 24-48 hours. This step cures the horn. 
9. Empty, rinse, and let dry completely. 
10. Seal with [Salad Bowl Finish.](http://www.amazon.com/General-Finishes-SBPT-Salad-Finish/dp/B001DSXD52/ref=pd_sim_60_2?ie=UTF8&amp;refRID=0C9WNJ5A1VRYSH3BFF0Q) 


If it is sealed with beeswax:

1. Fill with lukewarm water.
2. Drop in 2 denture tablets
3. Leave overnight, then rinse the next morning.
4. ALWAYS RINSE YOUR HORN OUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER USING IT. (Yes, that is in all caps. It's important. Otherwise you will degrade the beeswax and unseal the horn)
5. Dry upside down so all moisture will drain out.  

If it is sealed with a finish:

1. Wash with warm water and a bottle brush.
2. Dry on a dish rack upside down.

Judging from the /r/SC age poll the other day, I'm one of the older readers on this thread at 45.  I was a hot headed teenager when Roddy Piper hit the WWF, and had never seen anything like him.  When he had Frank Williams (a jobber in the truest sense of the word) on Piper's Pit, and said out loud what everyone could observe but never talked about, that this guy was a loser who would never win a match, and then beat the crap out of him, I just about lost my mind (nobody said ""marked out"" back then).  The tag line for that segment, about changing the questions, was one of the quotes I put on my Senior Page for my yearbook when I graduated high school.  Then he followed it up by breaking a coconut over Superfly Snuka's head - you have to understand, they just didn't have heels like that in the WWF back then.  Go listen to one of the early Austin podcasts where he tells his life story about being orphaned at an early age and growing up on an Indian Reservation in Central Canada, then he escaped and lived on the streets for a few years as a teenager.  The guy was functionally illiterate his whole life, but went on to be such a tremendous influence on so many and do some of the smartest work in the business when it came to drawing heat. A true original, and it turns out he was a great family man behind it all.

Diet is very important. Most foods marketed to ferrets actually include ingredients that ferrets can't/don't digest because they're obligate carnivores. Makes them produce more oils in their skin and makes them smell gross. A high quality, grain free cat food is actually a better choice. 

Ferrets can be litter trained to a box like a cat. Not everyone knows this. Makes cage cleaning easier. I keep my ferret on linens. After a week, I strip the cage and wash the linens with some detergent and vinegar. Wham, bam no smells.

Over-washing your ferret strips their oils and makes them smell worse because they make more oils. As weird as it sounds.

A well cared for ferret on a good diet should only smell if you actively try to stick your nose on it and sniff it. It'll smell kinda like incense (sandalwood). ","1438387514"

But you don't just stop at 2 points - as the granularity of your data increases, so will the accuracy of determining a card's strength.  Obviously it's impossible to evaluate *every* situation that a card may face.

En ese documental ves a Arturo cabalgando en la moto, y una investigadora del CSIC diciendo que fue un pionero. No entiendo a qué te refieres con lo de que ""ha sido desmentido"". Quieres decir que no existe forma de obtener hidrógeno a partir de agua con innumerables métodos? Pues si te oye un científico se escojona porque llevan haciéndolo un porron de años, hay mil ly un métodos de generar hidrógeno. Quizá la peor es la de Varela, yo prefiero la de meyer (cruzó todo USA con un buggy que usaba de combustible: agua) (USA es algo así coo seis españas de ancho). Ya he dicho que murió envenenado y ya he contado como luego en USA crearon una ley donde cualquier invento que pueda desestabilizar el sistema es parado y te meten en prision si insistes, esto es lo que evita que cualquiera de estas cosas salga de youtube y empiece a llegarnos a nuestras casas. En Europa una empresa de la India trató de introducir el coche que funciona con aire comprimido, pero no lo logró. Europa es una Mafia y no quiere coches con aire comprimido (el aire comprimido lo generas usando solar, viento, o mareas, yo prefiero el de las mareas, por ejemplo un hotel flotante, sube la marea y luego cuando baja la marea comprime una burrada de aire con lo cual cada día genera miles y miles de bombonas de aire comprimido.

I never got as far as trying to run anything on a device but I assume there must be a way to insert platform specific code in the projects generated by UE4. I can't help you much on how to do that.

You can put that in your review notes and in your app description and I think Apple will allow it but you can't stop people from getting it on older devices. There's a lot of apps with big messages ""DOES NOT RUN ON iPHONE 4"" in their description but then they get negative reviews from people who don't read it. You can specify the lowest iOS version as 8.0 which will cut out the iPhone 4 but people with a 4s will still be able to download it.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","&gt; &gt; That's one of the reasons why we create government. We create police to enforce our rules.

&gt; Lets be realistic though, you and I didn't create anything and the laws being enforced aren't anything we consented to. 

You are making the error of thinking that you or I (or any collection of people we know personally) are society.  No.  We are a little piece of something much larger.  It doesn't matter that you or I disagree with our government's policies; they are still the policies that We The People created and (at least through Our silence) condone.

&gt; If I was to consent to a system of government, it would look a whole lot differently than what we have today.

Well, sure, but there aren't enough people who think the way you do in our society to enact your will.  That doesn't make society's decisions any less valid.

&gt; &gt; The government is ours. When you rail at the government, you are actually railing at your fellow citizens.

&gt; Let me ask you then, why are you creating stupid drug laws against your fellow citizens? Do you realize how much suffering you have caused with your laws? Please stop it, I'm asking you nicely to stop it.

I agree.  Let's hope that enough of our society comes to think the way that you and I do on this topic to make change happen soon.

&gt; the reality is that you don't control government, the rich do. Sure they give you the illusion that you participate, but you really don't. What sort of evidence would you accept for me to give to you that could prove to you that you are not in control like you think?

I personally control almost nothing.  But the rich only control government because society lets them.  If We The People wanted to, we could elect representatives who would make democratization their primary purpose, and change would happen rapidly.  It doesn't even require changes in the judiciary.  Congress could solve the problem of money in politics very quickly.  We The People just don't give a damn about that, as is clearly shown by our voting choices.  I hate it, but there it is.

&gt; &gt; For example, I wish my fellow citizens would get money out of politics, but they just don't care that much.

&gt; Or they do care, but they're just as powerless as you. How can we determine the difference between caring but powerless versus non-caring but powerful?

There's no evidence that they care enough to vote on it as a priority.  That is the key thing.  They might say that they care in polls, but not enough to matter.

None of this invalidates my primary point, which is: **Government == Us**

"FieldOfKarmicGlory","t5_2ws9l","Furon sighed and took another drink as his legs and arms dangled over the railings of the docks. For a week he sat here and stared, only sleeping from passing out. His watch was never over. The ONS Centurion, his home, his dream...his crew...the fires. The pain came flooding back as he gazed upon the shattered hull of the ship, pocked with holes, charred and sitting on solid metal. He took another drink, his reddened eyes still watching. Suddenly it all went black and he began to dream.

**7:50 pm, off the coast of Mozter Island**

''Captain, I don't think splitting off from the fleet is a wise idea'' Lt. River said. ''Relax, Riv, it'll be fine. We can deal with one ship, no problem'' Furon said, carelessly waving his arms as he leaned back in his chair. ''Whaateever you say, Captain...'' River said, crossing her arms. ''Captain! Enemy ship in sight, sir!'' sounded through the bridge, ''Excellent! Let's mine a bitch!'' Furon eagerly responded. *THUNK*. ''What the fuck was that?'' Furon thought. *THUNK THUNK THUNK*. Furon stood. *BOOM* He was thrown to the side, slamming into a series of monitors as a rain of glass fell upon him. Sirens went off across the ship, small arms fire echoed from the outside. 

Furon struggled to stand when the door burst open, *POP POP POP*, he saw his conn officer plummet to the floor, her red shirt even more red now. ''Hey!'' he heard the sound but it sounded so far away. He tried to focus but he just couldn't, suddenly, he was back. But he never left? Everything felt so strange. He shook as he found himself suddenly next to a bloody periwinkle, River stood over him. ''Captain! We've been boarded!'' the words didn't make any sense to him for a moment.

 River grabbed him by the shirt and dragged him to his feet, ''We need to act now!!'' she shouted. ''Right..right! rightrightright!''. Furon dusted himself off, failing to notice the copious amount of blood on his head, chest and arm. He flung the door open and saw the chaos, gunfire, screams of unprepared sailors, ''dear god'' he thought. He took to the stairs, running down as fast as he could but they appeared to stretch on forever until they vanished in the blink of an eye and he found himself suddenly at the bottom. He pulled his pistol and fired on the first person he saw. *CRACK CRACK* and the form dropped. From behind, another, but River managed to throw him overboard. He turned in time to see an orange ball of fire erupt from the enemy ship and time slowed. He saw the water spread as the air around the shell pushed it aside and he turned with the shell as it tapped the bridge and swept him off his feet. All in complete silence. The heat searing his clothes, the metal ripping his skin, the ship folding like ripped gift paper. 

The next thing he knew, all he saw were stars and the blackest form slowly swallowing them all. He sat up. Silence. He saw men and women on fire, shaking, rolling and falling into the sea. Black goo eeked closer to him and the fire followed it. He turned his head, even the water was on fire. That's when he became aware of the shrieking ring that penetrated his ears. Then the pain came. He screamed but all he heard was a softer silence. As if the wind has gently blown into his ear on a quiet sunny day at sea. He took to his feet and became aware of the large piece of metal lodged in between his leg and his kneecap. He reached down and pulled with all his might as tears welled in his eyes, the pain was unbearable. God damn it, why did it have to be me? He tore the metal from his flesh as the red-tinted tar flooded outwards and he fell to one knee and rolled over in pain. Looking up, the fire was practically upon him and he could see his crew screaming. Screaming for orders, oh god, what should they do? He saw the flashes of guns, the heat of the fire, the looming monster in between him and the moon. He pulled himself up. ''ABANDON SHIP!'' he tried to scream. ''ABAND-'' black. That was all he remembered. Blackness followed by the coldest chill he had ever felt. Colder than Vuoria.

He opened his eyes again. ''Fuck'' he slurred as he pulled himself back up and regarded his splintered vessel once again. He looked down at himself. Covered in scars, bandages and dried liquor in sweat soaked sweatpants and a t-shirt from a dinky gift shop in Tangerium that said ''I &lt;3 the desert!''. Why couldn't he react? Why didn't he say anything sooner? Why did he split off from the fleet? Why did he have to be such a godforsaken failure? These thoughts filled Furon's mind as he took another drink and smashed the bottle on the steel railing. Footsteps came from behind him. ''Sir'' the voice said, somewhat unsure of itself and full of sadness. Furon turned his head. It was the lieutenant. It was River. ''Whadyawant?'' he said, ''am...bbbusy'' he turned back to the ship. ''Sir, they've invaded Dutchman's Grounds...we have orders to-'', ''Fuck the orders'' he said, filled with spite and self hatred. ''Sir, we have t-'', ''God damn it, Lt. Reddsheer, I'm busy'' he said, trying to sober up. ''Captain, look, what happened on the Centurion was a tragedy, we lost a lot of good people but that is no reason to sit here like a baby and brood about it!'' River shouted, her voice firm and resolute. Furon remained quiet. ''We need to get our asses to DG, that's an order. You have been given command over a temporary vessel while the Centurion is repaired, the ONS Daybreaker. Report when you've cleaned yourself up''. She turned to go. ''Riv..'' Furon said, she halted. ''All those people..do you think it was my fault?''. Silence. He hated silence, why was it always silence, why couldn't there ever just be noise for once!? As he stared, footsteps. And they faded away as the lieutenant walked away from him. The question hung in the air until seemingly blown away like cigarette smoke by the wind. ''Was it my fault?''

It's a nice idea, and if mana manipulation was more prevalent it'd make a great card, but as it stands it's incredibly niche to the point where I'm not sure it'd see play; I don't think there's enough combo potential to spawn a new archetype. Plus, I'm not sure how much more mana manipulation I'd *want* to see in Hearthstone. It already annoys me when Druids get in two Wild Growths early and I'm facing a board much bigger than should be fair. I like how mana crystals are, for the most part, a level playing field.

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","That's fair, interestingly enough this kind of exact issue arose in the early church between the Eastern and Western Churches in the second century. The Eastern Churches celebrated Easter on the 14th of Nisan, to commemorate Christ's sacrifice. Whereas the Western Churches celebrated Easter on the following Sunday, to commemorate Christ's resurrection. This was a big thing in the second century and almost tore the Church apart but Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna (and disciple of John) went to see what was up and visited Pope Anicetus, the Second Bishop of Rome after Peter. And they discussed this very topic of divergence and when neither side would budge they ate communion together (which is a big deal), to show that even though they had differing customs, this wasn't an issue to schism over.

So, this is just the 21st century version of the ""[quatrodeciman controvery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartodecimanism)"". I respect your deference of the cross, and I hope you can respect our deference to the crucifix.","1438387532"

Best part: when they still refuse to pay the full amount of the thing they specifically sent documents saying they covered and you have exact proof they should pay the thing.

Thumb for left-click, index for cursor movement (and for operating scroll+middle button), and middle finger for right click. My two other fingers rest on the side.

Cruise, on the other hand, made many decks simply not viable. UR Delver became *the* delver deck to run because none could match the power. Decks running discard had no game because cruise let you refuel with almost no effort and the discarded cards fueled those very cruises. Shardless was crowded out because cruise just out card advantaged it. Elves was worse during UR Delver's reign due to all the splash damage.

It was bad for the format and the meta severely contracted. 

Dig didn't do that. It made some decks stronger, sure, but the meta is still diverse and healthy (even with miracles making up a larger proportion of the meta than prior).","1438387538"

Learn the starting positions, if you're further back to start relative to your teammates DEFEND, do not stay in goal the whole time though it will take a ton of offense from your team.  A good rule or thumb if you're hanging back on D is to just make sure the ball stays in the opposing team's half, if it's coming back towards your half just crush it towards their goal.  It's a hell of a lot harder to defend your own goal from balls flying around than it is to attack the ball on offense.  Be patient; a lot of players chase the ball all the time and are wayyy out of position when someone intercepts their target, don't be that guy.  Wait for the right moment to attack the ball and if you are on defense just crush it away from your goal.

They call it the cosmos, the thing that's there. 'All a random accident'.

Such a view diminishes existence and degrades others around us to be inconsequential everyday things.


But it's not. It's extraordinary and benevolent in using all of its abilities to provide a platform for us. And knowing this helps shape our interactions. I would never consider harming someone because it is a momentary transgression that must be born for the length of my existence. You are of God and should be treated as such.

the only design decision I disagree with is not having a gold reward for 2hg and not having an ingame chat. both of which don't ruin the game for me tbh. not having a goldsink is bad for their income once battle for zendikar drops because people will simply have all the money they need without having to invest but it doesn't influence me directly either.","1438387542"

"Winnipeg","t5_2qtno","One of the most common agent names I've seen for Village condos, although the majority are on Wellington, is Dallas Rosenblat at Sigmar MacKenzie but I have no idea how good or bad she is. Often the big name agents you deal with their junior agent team members or assistants.

A previous thread on here from a practicing realtor mentioned how agents ""new to the game"" might go the extra mile as that extra sale can make a huge difference to their bottom line, since there are monthly costs to belonging to a brokerage regardless of you making a single sale or not. At the same time, you want someone with some condo experience. You really should interview multiple agents and not fall for the one that ""buys"" the listing by throwing out the highest price but the one that can provide records of price and days on market of units in your building and ones nearby similar to it.

My only agent experience was Ken Maines at Maximum Realty who we used for a relative's estate house sale and couldn't be happier. I've recommended him to others who used him with similar results. I know I've seen condo listings by him on the mls.","1438387543"

"HunterXHunter","t5_2spu5","I agree that Hisoka seems to be better at thinking on his feet, while Pariston likes to plan things out, but I think they are equally unpredictable and deceptive. The only reason Ging knew what Pariston was doing during the Election Arc is because Ging knew that he and Pariston think alike. Also, the only reason Ging caught Pariston's attempt to get him to reveal his powers is because of Muhel's bad acting. So I think they are even in terms of unpredictability and deception.

Also, Hisoka doesn't think he's the best fighter in the world. He knew Netero would've whooped him hard but Hisoka likes to poke and prod people. Chrollo must be a beast, of course, but Hisoka is all about challenging strong people. If Hisoka ranked Illumi as a 95, then he believes he could beat him by a small margin (of 5 points on his scale). I think you would agree that both Zeno and Silva could whoop Illumi, right? And Zeno said Chrollo could whoop him if he was going all out. That puts Chrollo out of Hisoka's league for now. So I think it's safe to say Hisoka is merely looking for strong opponents to challenge, but he isn't THAT cocky to think he is the best. ","1438387545"

Humanity / Karma Systems don't punish PVP, they simply offer the ability to show others that you don't KOS.  So if I see another Hero like me, I know he's not going to shoot me because he'll lose his Hero status.

Sanity Systems punish PVP.  So if I'm out to protect a town from bandits, eventually I'll just go insane and kill myself.  Or I have to micromanage how many bandits I kill with how much meds I have and how many times I rested, too much micromanagement......lol

There's been a lot of interest in both systems.  If they add Humanity / Karma Servers AND Sanity Servers AND Roleplay Servers I'm all for it.  Each community should have a place to call home.  I just prefer Humanity / Karma over all the others.","1438387546"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","You can't get engaged to or marry someone who is straight up lying to you. Before you accuse her of lying though, double and triple check that no one else could have stolen the pills (did you have friends over? family?).

Sit her down and lay out the evidence. Show her the numbers you've written down and do the pill count with her. Ask her point blank if she's been stealing pills. Ask her if it isn't her stealing, who is? 

You need to take this seriously. Stealing pills is illegal not to mention a potential precursor for other big problems like addiction. Honestly, I would consider stealing + lying the beginning of the end of the relationship.","1438387552"
"cringepics","t5_2va9w","This is absolute shit. You know what, I had an abortion and I did use planned parenthood as an ""abortion service"". I had full health coverage as well as a family practitioner who I could have gone to. The thing is, when I knew I was pregnant I knew immediately that it was not the right time or situation to keep a child. I did not want to go to my regular doctor and feel pressured to keep the child. I wanted to keep the situation to myself and having a low profile location to visit was exactly what I needed in the situation. The staff were good. There was no pushing to get the abortion. In fact, they required a counseling session as well as an ultrasound prior to providing me with the pills. I had plenty of time and opportunity to change my mind. I was also offered counseling and support should I choose to keep the child. Don't shit on something you have no experience with yourself. ","1438387552"
"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I think this is a non sequitur in terms of the abortion debate. Abortion rights are predicated on the right to bodily autonomy, not on whether fetuses are human life.

The idea is that your right to your own body supersedes anyone else's right to it, fetus or not. So a woman can do anything she wants with her own body, regardless of whether she's got a fetus in there. That's why viability is an important turning point: it's when removing the fetus from your body no longer necessarily means killing it.

TLDR: a right to abortion is the right to remove a fetus from your body, not the right to kill it. It's just that removing it kills it until the point of viability.","1438387552"

For the Kuro buttons, I just don't like how they work out for me. They feel difference physically yet actuation is about the same. I don't feel the same responsiveness as I do from most Sanwas.

It seems relatively harmless, hyperbolic and not mean spirited. I hate Kim however. It's over the top, pointless and unnecessary as well as obviously mean spirited and what he says in that song seems to be how he truly feels.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Yeah, those are certainly the better parts.  The relationship between AJ, Min, and his parents was interesting, but it should have been the focus of the game rather than hidden away in some text.  There should've been conflict between his interests with Min and the Golden Path.  Instead you're forced to support the latter and choose between two fucking assholes like there's some great philosophical conundrum.  Like oh ho looks may be deceiving as if we ever had a chance to learn about the pros and cons of either.  Just constant scaling remarks from the idiot you didn't choose.

Additionally we know nothing about Ajay.  He has zero development.  He's just always a super soldier.  Far Cry 3 integrated the combat and leveling system with Jason's own character growth.  His growing strength and bloodlust was integral to the plot.  

So instead of a cool choice between the rebels and tyranny with Ajay growing and learning of his parents, we ultimately get to be an errand boy for either an idiot pedophile or a smug drug lord.  Such choice wow.  Except to kill them both.

There was no cohesive plot arc, just the interesting bits you mention.  But that back story hardly manifests itself in the game.  And it irked me because there was serious potential there.  

Another random thought, the castle lords just come out of nowhere.  You get like one mission to learn about them and then they're dead.  Like, what was the point?  Who cares?  And fuck those two stoners.  They were infuriating.

"TagPro","t5_2w7hh","Please note that while this is a great guide for CTF maps, not all of it applies for Neutral Flag. You almost never want to go backwards, even a little, on a neutral flag map, because chances are your teammates are ahead blocking for you, and if you get yourself returned it's a free cap for the other team. In neutral flag maps, your #1 goal should always be to move the flag forward, keep pushing it down the defense's throat. Be smart though - too much aggression on NF maps makes counter-caps extremely easy. Don't be afraid to leave one on defense in certain situations. On Cloud, if they're on your half of the field, I will almost always wait behind the gate so we're not totally fucked if an enemy gets on the gate and my teammates aren't in good position for a return or to fight for the gate.

"Tulpas","t5_2u69x","Hello. Before sharing my experiences, I'm going to offer my few cents on some of the matters you mentioned.

Regarding the concept of ""crazy""... mental illness, as a concept, is widely misused and abused. Many people use it to mean ""something another person does that I don't like"" or ""something that's different from me that I don't understand"". In truth, a mental illness is neither of these. To directly quote the DSM-5, the Bible of psychiatry itself:

&gt;A mental disorder is a syndrome characterized by **clinically significant** disturbance in an individual's cognition, emotion regulation, or behavior that reflects a dysfunction in the psychological, biological, or developmental processes underlying mental functioning. Mental disorders are usually associated with **significant distress in social, occupational, or other important activities.** An expectable or culturally approved response to a common stressor or loss, such as the death of a loved one, is not a mental disorder. **Socially deviant behavior (e.g., political, religious, or sexual) and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the deviance or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individual, as described above.**

In summary: a mental illness is characterized by the presence of significant distress, dysfunction, or danger. A behavior that is odd--or ""deviant"" from the norm, as the formal terminology would have it--that does not result in any of those three cannot be considered a mental illness, no matter what some layperson on the street might try to tell you. So, if you are concerned about tulpamancy being a mental illness, rest assured that is not the case. (Do note, however, that tulpamancy does require the breaking of certain mental barriers and a drastic reconfiguration of subjective reality, which may expose new vulnerabilities or exacerbate pre-existing ones.) And it would appear that, by choosing to enter tulpamancy despite your doubts, you're already not concerned about how the average Joe on the street would label you... which is something I tip my metaphorical hat to. Moving on.

&gt;A tulpa sounds like a type of manifestation of cognitive disassociation.

By my speculation? You're absolutely correct. My current model of tulpa formation is that a tulpa is, to partially quote /u/BloodyKitten, a set of processes you create and then dissociate from until they up and become autonomous. The flaw lies in saying tulpas are ""just"" dissociation--there is no ""just"" about either the human brain or the experience of consciousness, which are as much mysteries to us as the far reaches of the galaxy. By my reckoning, a tulpa can be a product of dissociation *and* also their own consciousness.

I have covered my current hypothesis on what tulpas are in two previous posts. If you'd like to read them, you can find them right here:

[Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/3djqmw/what_is_a_tulpa_to_you/ct5u9ov)

[Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tulpas/comments/3eqpsh/moronic_monday_72715/ctint2i)

From that, I will segue into...

&gt;But if it's a trick, it's a extremely useful one! Imagine having twice the support when making a ciritcal decision that another person can't help you make. A literal separate pair of eyes understanding situations in a slightly different manner that can offer guidance. A fiend that you can share the most complex and intimate thoughts that you have, but can't share with the world.

If you are hoping to truly double the brain's processing power, I am afraid that may not be the case. As I mentioned in my two hypothesis posts, awareness/consciousness is more an abstract result of a physical process than a process itself--thus, it is possible, with a little change in the way processes are conducted, to generate a second awareness without actually significantly increasing the activity of the brain itself. 

On top of that, the brain is more modular than most realize. Think of processes such as adding, typing, inverting matrices, as *tools* accessed by the consciousness rather than parts of a consciousness itself. After all, a consciousness is not less of a consciousness if it cannot do math. So even if you were to increase the number of consciousnesses in a head, the number of *tools* would remain constant, and activity would still be bottlenecked by this limited number of tools.

Now, each consciousness can still use each toolset differently, especially when experience is accrued. However, keep in mind that they are limited again by what is present within your head. What allows different people to have different viewpoints is difference in *experience*--those who come from different races, genders, socioeconomic classes, will all have different outlooks colored by their experiences growing up. As I said in a previous post, we are the products of our environment, and a tulpa, though they will be different, will not have accrued the degree of difference as another physical person would. So while there is no harm in asking for a second opinion from your tulpa, I would highly recommend asking for a third from other physical individuals as well, especially concerning sensitive matters.

In short, you will certainly be able to create a companion who you can tell your secrets to. However, it is highly unlikely you and your tulpa will be able to do two different calculus problems at the same time with the ease of two physically separate individuals.

Keep in mind that this is all my speculation. To conclude on a briefer note...

&gt;So naturally it must be using the only one brain cells available, the persons. So it could just be a simple mind trick.

I'm curious as to how you define a person. By my reckoning, by virtue of possessing consciousness, thought, and subjectivity, a tulpa would certainly qualify as a person. Now, granted, there are many definitions of ""person""--the fluidity of words is a topic for another time...--but some definitions are more relevant to certain questions than others.

And remember, there is no ""just"" about the brain. ;)

But for me, the all time best theme, guaranteed to make everyone react, was....

*BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!! MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEEYYY-EEYY!!""*

Second, have you gotten tested for ADD? I have it and am currently unmedicated and I forgot absolutely everything. It does affect me at work.

"entp","t5_2qoy3","   You can always go to the mall and practice having conversations. Focus on saying things that both sides can relate to. I, for example could talk someone's ears off with my league of ledgends stories, but I do not ulness they also play. When I start throwing in terms like DPS (damage per second), DOTs (damage over time, plural) and start mentioning characters they have never heard of, how can they enjoy the conversation. How can they follow the conversation?  They can't. Because at that point, you sharing words, not thoughts. And that is boring. It is like reading a text book about a subject you find dull. 

   Honestly,  your boyfriend sounds a bit controlling.  You gave up your friends for him. He does not like how you try to make new friends, at least when he is around. You describe him as an introvert. He needs more alone time than you. Likely he does not understand your need of others. My recommendation would be to try to make new friends without him around. Find your own style of hanging out with people, and your own people to hang out with. Hang out at your local library (although, you might have to practice cleaning up your language and topics first). The average intelligence of humans found there is higher than the average intelligence found in the ""wild.""

   And oh, you should share some of your art for us to see! (See what I did there, I ask about one of your personal interests. Did you enjoy that, I bet other people will too! But for real, I love to see what comes out of other people's imaginations, so please send pics)","1438387562"

My savings graces were the popsicles, because they were the only thing I could chew. Also, making protein shakes in my nutri-bullet with ice and milk. They were definitely more filling that way. And it's important to find a protein powder/drink that you really enjoy. I hates the premade shakes and found that the Syntrax Nectar brand was my favorite. I bought a bunch of different flavors so I didn't get sick of them. 

It's hard, it sucks. Just keep your eye on the prize. I'm having the easiest post-op experience, it honestly feels like a dream. If I didn't have this little bit of tenderness in my belly and these 5 incisions, I wouldn't know I had surgery. ","1438387563"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","The most glaring obvious one is the fact that I went through the medical issue doctors could not diagnose that mimic symptoms of a brain tumor and that was listed a symptom of people exposed to Project Medusa.


I have never been a conspiracy theorist person and I was floored when I found out Project Medusa was a very real thing. There does not seem to be a ton of information compared other theories (like 9/11 truthers or whatever) but from the Freedom of Information Act stating that it was a military thing.

I was at a bar when I met and started chatting up an individual who claimed to be in the military, I am blanking on what branch. Apparently he was POW. I asked him about Project Medusa in a nonchalant way. He responded he knew what it was and that it had to do with experiments of people who had abilities. He said he didn't know too much more. His girlfriend said that he left a few days later.

After this went down my electric to my house was cut for a year. The electric  company reported that I needed to fix a specific pipe in order for them to turn it on. Delay after delay after delay happened. (I ended up basically spending that year at a friends) When it was fixed and they finally agreed to turn it on literally right across the street is a aluminium colored box that is about as wide as my house. That might just be a coincidence.

I've lived in my house for 10 years and lived in the neighborhood (less than a few block radius) my entire life. Neighbors really don't talk to each other that much, but I got into a conversation about something pretty mundane with a neighbor about a block down the road and back. She asked me if I remembered when the SWAT team came out a few years back. I said no. She asked how I could I have forgotten that there were ton of police, uniformed people, and the swat team came out she said she thinks it was because of drugs. I asked where it occurred at she pointed towards my house. 

This is something that might make lose all credibility. Some folks in my family have really really strong intuition. Not psychic or any of that kind of shit, but just really in tune and something just get strong feelings of what's going to happen. It seems to be a somewhat genetic thing, but I thought for a bit that maybe they were looking for people who had a predisposition for that kind of stuff - mind control, reading minds, whatever. So, in an indirect way , because I don't bring this up at all, I start talking to her, come to find out she was actually institutionalized when she was in her mid20s because she was seeing things that weren't there and thought people were out to get her. She says she doesn't like to talk about it and the only people who knew about it were her father and my father. This led me to think that it was some sort of schizophrenic thing, but after some therapist visits I ruled that out. 

There was a serious scandal and allegations in a nearby location of where I live at that involved some allegations towards high level politicians and the use of MKUltra - Project Monarch.

Rules are made because they work most of the time to handle most situations. You can play without rules, but then you have to come up with an explanation for everything off the cuff. With someone who can sit down and dedicate years of experience and knowledge to solving problems on how to make an encounter efficient and fun, it saves the GM from having to make stuff up on the spot.

The thing is, there's always exceptions to the rules. Yes, a rule is typically the best option you have most of the time. You can break the rules, but it's ideal only to do so if you understand the rule **and** the mechanics of the rule fail to uphold the intent of the rule in a given situation.

Otherwise, it's largely what you said. =3","1438387566"

Unless you eat *lots* of sushi, you might consider something more general purpose.  I go for medium grain.

Things that I keep &amp; tend to buy in large quantities

* medium grain rice
* pinto beans
* dry pasta
* canned tomato products (and some canned pasta sauce for lazy days)
* garlic powder
* onion powder
* powdered chili peppers
* oregano
* bullion cubes
* diced garlic
* large bottles of lemon &amp; lime juice
* smoked pork necks/turkey wings (stored in freezer)
* frozen pepper/onion mix
* frozen shredded spinach
* frozen chicken breasts
* vegetable/corn oil
* olive oil

Technically perishable but I go through them in large quantities:
* big-ass bags of tortillas
* jugs of cheap salsa
* Sharp cheddar cheese

...and, as a treat, frozen pizza &amp; frozen buffalo wings.  Buffalo wings + rice is a pretty good lunch.

When you eat or blend fruits and vegetables, you usually do not strain out the fiber. The more blended they are, the more the fiber gets destroyed, but keeping it in and as whole as you can is better than straining it out or completely liquifying it. 

Finally, I'm not a fan of drinking your calories.  Drinking a ""smoothie"" is more mindless than mindful. ""Don't drink your calories"" is a tip that has helped me succeed at weight loss. 

Slowing down, taking several minutes to consume a meal to allow and notice the end of hunger-signalling is advice that I frequently offer -- and drinking down food runs counter to that.

We were talking about smoothies (not just vegetables) on my MFP News Feed today, I'll share what others had to say:

**funchords**
Smoothies pro? con?

**funchords** drinking a smoothie is more mindless than mindful. ""Don't drink your calories"" is a tip that has helped me succeed at weight loss. Slowing down, taking several minutes to consume a meal to allow and notice the end of hunger-signalling is advice that I frequently offer -- and drinking down a meal runs counter to that.

**funchords** on the other hand, I always admire those smoothie recipes that have spinach in them -- how can anybody put the hate on something that is full of spinach?

**rigby88** Yes if you honestly know and count what's in them, ie made at home. Some healthy sounding smoothie at a café can actually be huge calories if you're not aware / careful.

**chesves** I have a hard time eating breakfast, although I know it's important and I should eat it. This is when a smoothie fits for me .... I get a good boost of protein, and it helps with me not being as hungry at lunchtime.

**sapf** I use smoothies as post run recovery drinks because after a long run it is hard to get my body to eat solid food for a few hours. My smoothie is usually: 100g frozen strawberries, 100g raw baby spinach, and a scoop of vegan meal replacement powder. It is under 250 cals and has a fair amount of protein for post run recovery.

**saraklemowitz** i think smoothies can be really filling and nutrient-rich, but a lot of times they are deceptively high in calories. the thing i really have a problem with is juicing. i don't understand the point of taking all the calories/sugar from fruit/veg and abandoning pulp/fiber. i was actually at a housewares show and i asked a juicer salesman about it and he said you're supposed to save the pulp and use it in carrot cake/breads/other recipes...wtf

**yellow_llama** I make my own smoothies and they're great for when I don't want to eat breakfast or when I've had a late breakfast so don't fancy having lunch before my tea. I only ever make them myself and know what goes into them. I can make a very large berry smoothie with yoghurt, banana and baby spinach for roughly 250 calories

**fromthesticks** Smoothies are great, put only the things in you want and easy to control exactly what you want, I try to stay away from buying smoothies from Starbucks and others, I try to only make them in my blender at the house.

**ellielombardi** I like having my smoothies in the morning, but I do make them myself. I find that most mornings, I don't really feel like eating anything like eggs, oatmeal, etc, but I should eat so I don't get TOO hungry--ya know? Spinach in smoothies is awesome, because you honestly don't taste them. As for it being mindless, it can be in comparison to solid food, but it depends on your behaviour while you drink it. Are you focusing on your breakfast or something else?

**ellielombardi** You could also try a ""smoothie bowl"" if you want it to be less mindless. http://minimalistbaker.com/super-green-smoothie-bowl/ is an example, but I find if I'm using frozen fruit to make your smoothie, I tend to not use enough liquid and it basically becomes soft serve ice cream. You could do something similar if you wanted it to be more think as opposed to soupy.

**Multanis** If you make them yourself and know what you put into them they can be good i think. As i don't have a mixer at home to make them myself, i don't drink them. Bought one a long while ago, way before my weight loss, and didn't like them at all, so i never bothered again. A smoothie made of vegetables can be really good i think, but on the other hand fruit smoothies can be real calorie bombs. I watched a documentary on Netflix not long ago where a man was drinking only shakes made of vegetables for a few months which was kind of interesting. It wouldn't be anything i would consider for myself tho, as it is not a lifestyle change, unless you plan to drink that stuff for the rest of your life. But still something that could be tried out as a morning meal or something like that. The name of the documentary was ""Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead"", also has a 2nd part.

**Munchees** If you make them at home, I think they can be a great breakfast. I usually do 1 cup of 0% greek yogurt, spinach, 1/2 cup of frozen berries, and a scoop of protein powder, and some ice/water. Comes out around 300 calories has a serving of veggies and protein. But do what works for you. If you avoid drinking your calories, it may go against a system you have that works.

**hoopla101** I love smoothies, but only simple low calorie ones! I do 5oz frozen strawberry, 5oz frozen grapes, and as much kale or spinach I can shove in my tiny food processor. Usually about 70g. No extra sweetener or anything, and its a huge portion that comes out really thick, so I eat it with a spoon. Can easily replace my dinner, and if you've been having any digestion issues, the next day you're going to be good as new lol :)

**nekoface** I have a smoothie for breakfast. It kills my chocolate craving for the day and has more protein than I normally have for breakfast. I think of it as a meal rather than a drink.

**clairecwood** I absolutely love my smoothies for breakfast, but we make them at home and are very mindful of what goes into them. I use greek yogurt, spinach/kale, and fresh/frozen fruit. They're delicious and filling, and I rarely feel hungry until lunchtime afterwards! They usually fall somewhere between 200-300 calories for a 16oz tervis tumbler, which is a perfect breakfast for me. You probably couldn't pay me to start drinking the ones from stores though... too much unknown and too high in calories!

**calithulu** Neutral. They can be convenient but they just don't provide much satiety for me.

**Loluka88** Personally I don't like them. Even healthy ones can be like 400 or so calories and they don't seem to keep me full for long at all. I guess it would be worth it if you dumped protein powder or something to help with satiety.

**Loluka88** I should add that I never made them with spinach or kale. My smoothies were always yogurt and fresh/frozen fruit with some skim milk. So I might have just been making the wrong kind!

**israfelsaudience** I do less smoothies and more shakes. Meal replacement powder (I use Whole Foods' Plant Based Nutritional Shake), soy or cashew milk, and sometimes a little extra like cocoa powder, espresso powder, or powdered peanut butter. Plenty of protein, tons of vitamins, very little carbs or sugar, and it's very satisfying. I prefer to eat my fruits and veggies whole.

**CamielLawler** I've been using a protein shake powder in the mornings. It's the only way I get breakfast. I have always had a real hard time eating anything in the mornings and this way I'm getting some nutrients and I'm not starving and overeating by lunch time.

 I have very round, full breasts(they are pendulous but still full all over when left to their own devices) and these actually have enough space for me so I could see them being a problem for others with less full breasts. 
The balconette ones fit as well but they push my already high set breasts  to where I can use them as a pillow. Besides I don't where low cut/open necklines so it looks strange anyway.","1438387574"

Not everyone has the time to help you fix your misunderstandings, but constantly striving to seek truth will result in tremendous personal growth.

You can see the discussion [here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/3f2adr/new_essential_community_favourite_album_lists/ctktcgg).  At the end of the discussion, I proposed that /u/benergiser pick 25 Bay Area artists and albums and that I would do the same for Southern California and we could compare.  I suggested that he could pick 2pac as an artist through Sept. 1995 (Interscope) and I could pick 2pac from Oct. 1995-Sept. 1996 (Death Row).  Here's my Southern California list in alphabetical order (along with some honorable mentions).  Looking forward to seeing what you come up with, /u/benergiser:

My hosted tournament in other hand had ELO ranking and final bracket and it took 1 month to play, but with no rewards it got a little bit buried.

"canada","t5_2qh68","I think that voting for what you really want is very important.  Many times people try to vote against something with the first or second choice.  This has the effect of limiting the number of parties to two and that is not healthy because two parties will simply gravitate towards each other and you have coke and pepsi.

Second, I think voting for a non-establishment party is important.  It will take a non-establishment party to bow out of the TPP.  The Liberals and the Conservatives will both implement it.  Same with the security state.  

Third, the world has shifted right in the last decades.  This is based upon economic theories based in U Chicago that have been empirically demolished.  Business taxes are down yet wages are down too in real dollars.  We have sacrificed much at the alter of economic efficiency with little to show for it except more profitable companies and share buy-back schemes.  The situation is such that Marx is right: people really are isolated from the means of production.  They're serfs today.  If Marx is right, you know you have a problem.

Finally, people don't like unions and that is fine.  But there is a double standard: they say ""I would never work in a union"" but never say ""I would never work in a company"".  Companies and unions are just two sides of the same coin: there are both good and bad.  The empirical effect of the dissolving of the union movement is a drop in wages.  And this is critical to the wellbeing of all society.  It matters two hoots in the economy if a CEO can make an extra $M.  (They'll just put it away in Bermuda or some such off shore tax shelter.) It matters a lot if a thousand employees make $1k more (They'll spend it or perhaps save some in a local financial institution.) But we've lost that idea.

So I'm (guess what!) an NDP supporter.  I used to be a Conservative supporter but they blindly support all those outdated and radical economic ideas that empirically just don't hold water any more.

PS:
Elizabeth May has my respect too, however.  People will always bring up the wifi thing as a cheap shot but the science is changing:  Non-ionizing radiation *does* affect biological processes and so she's absolutely right to be cautious.  Just because 8011a/b/c/g/n is pervasive does not mean it is safe for elementary schools.  (I'm on an n connection now but you have to let science do it's thing.)","1438387577"

"woodworking","t5_2qlqp","Thank you! I'll try to keep it short

The material is a bit difficult to guess cost, since I grabbed what was lying around, but I'll give a rundown of what was used.

Materials used are birch veneer, solid walnut wood and cement (""finbetong"" in swedish, with 0-6 mm patricle/gravel size). 

The lamp shade part is 0.5-0.6 mm birch veneer, if you cant find it at a local woodshop, look through ebay for marquetry supplies.
The ""stem"" is two 60*30mm pieces of walnut, I split it in half to cut the groove for the cable, but if you have a long enough drill you could use a solid piece and just drill a hole down the middle with a drill press.

Through trial and error I found that to fit the veneer to the walnut you should cut a 45 degree 10 mm deep groove from the center line, to achieve a round shape of the veneer.

To cast the cement you need a square mold. I used 30 mm wide scrap fir to get the right height, and a plywood bottom to make sure the mold was leveled.

Then I just placed the ""stem"" part in the mold and poured the cement, making sure to keep it leveled to the height of the fir frame. (I used some steel rods for reinforcement, but there are better ways to get a rigid structure.)

When the cement was dried I could wire in the electrical and fit in the veneer.

If you have any further questions about the process just PM me and I 'll do my best to answer your questions.","1438387578"

I've been playing since beta and have never had a precursor drop, I have no Legendary, and Kudzu is the ONLY Legendary I've ever wanted. Longbow is my favorite weapon - I use it on my Shoutbow Warrior, I use it on my Ranger, and I plan on using it on my Dragonhunter. Besides being my all time favorite weapon, Kudzu has the best Legendary skin in the game (I absolutely adore the design as well as the lovely flower footfalls)! 

The thing is, with my full time job as well as taking care of my husband, I don't have enough time to grind out the type of gold needed to buy the Leaf of Kudzu. You giving me the Leaf of Kudzu would be AMAZING and make my dream of having Kudzu an actual obtainable goal! ","1438387578"

But I can talk about  me, a 30-something adult. I literally cannot get an adequate amount of productive work done when I'm not on my meds. My medication prescription got flubbed one time and I went without for 2+ weeks. It drove me crazy that I did the equivalent of 3 hours of work one week. I went to work with every intention of working, and looked up at 5pm realizing that all I'd done was read the newspaper (I never do that), did the puzzles in the paper (I never do that), browsed news sites (I do that, but not obsessively), and doodled (I never, ever do that). That repeated for 5 days. I tried herbal supplements, tried meditation, pomodoro, being coached... Still got nothing done. Next week, everything was the exact same except I had my meds. Worked for 40+ hours and wasn't distracted by the newspaper. 

I've tried at various times to deal with things without the meds. I need them. I have a real condition that coaching, diet, exercise, structure, herbal supplements, and therapy alone cannot adequately address. Call it ADHD or call it ""glortsnat"", I don't care. I've got it.","1438387578"

Even if you have Gb router and have a wired connection, your network can still affect the result. It boils down to if you router is busy doing something else and cannot serve your streaming needs. 

In practice, this means that your result may vary depending on the router and the software on it as some routers can support different software to be loaded in addition to the network traffic load.

&gt; I would guess, that decoding a 1080p stream while doing Halo is simply too much for the CPU.

If you are talking about the PC being streamed to, it does not matter. The PC only decodes the 1080p, and the Xbox One renders the game, and encodes the 1080p stream. Most PCs these days have hardware support to effortlessly decode video streams so even a cheap tablet with Windows 10 can stream to just fine.

&gt;Does the same happen, if you simply download a game/movie from the store?

That depends on the network, but the Xbox One should have no problems doing both as it has separated the resources for gaming,  and apps (in this case downloading and streaming).","1438387581"

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","My story will be about how I was introduced to the Glorious PC Master Race.

I had been gaming on some really crappy PS3 in the day. (It only had 80 GB of storage too! And it constantly overheated) I absolutely despised the next-gen consoles, too. Paid online, and personally I thought the PS4 looked a bit ugly, I really don't remember why. At that same time, I had an iMac. It was alright, but when it was really taxed, it ran everything absolutely horribly. Although I had several fond memories. Mainly playing Watch_Dogs at the lowest resolution in high settings (i was desperate, i could've played low at 1080p, but I really wanted to see the reflections). Also remember playing Skyrim and being confused as to why the framerate dropped under 20 with an ENB. Oh how I was naive.

Anyway, so I decided that this iMac really wasn't enough for me. I really wanted a so called ""gaming PC"". But they were REALLY expensive. I was looking on YouTube, and saw some videos about builds and was very interested. 

I told my cousins about it, and they offered me tons of spare parts, and I basically hit a goldmine. 16 GB quad channel, 2 TB HDD, EVGA NEX 650W, an MSI mobo (some cheap one, but I was still very grateful.) a HD 4870x2 and an FX 4170. I was overjoyed. So I ordered a Fractal Define R4 and a CoolerMaster 212 EVO (he lost the stock cooler).

I basically ascended, and while that was much better than iMac, I still kinda wanted to upgrade. I waited a few good months, seeing as the GTX 700 series had been out for a while, and the leaks of 800 (now 900) series had been announced. Then they were announced and the 900s were released. The GTX 970 was basically a godsend for me, affordable, powerful, and great power efficiency. So after I went through the struggle of getting them (they were going out of stock in mere seconds) I finally had one. I plugged the badboy in my rig, bid farewell to the HD 4870x2, and basically loved the thing.

I had the FX 4170 for a good while with the GTX 970. The bottleneck wasn't that bad for me, as I had come from an iMac so I was happy with anything. But soon, I decided I needed an upgrade. Witcher 3 was close to release and I really wanted to make sure I can play this game at its finest. So after looking up tons and tons of CPUs, I decided to go with the i5 4690. I needed a new motherboard, and since I had an Asus STRIX GTX 970, I thought I'd get an Asus motherboard. Went with the Maximus VI Hero, and man, was it easier to install than that old MSI motherboard. BIOS update took place at the push of single button, and everything worked perfectly. And now, that's the rig I have now. I absolutely love it. It's quiet, discrete, and runs everything I like. 

Well, that's about it for my story. As a closing note, glory to the PC Master Race, and praise GabeN!","1438387583"

&gt;In its response, the JPO said the F-35 used in the trial was one of the oldest in the fleet and had been designed for flight sciences **(aircraft handling) testing** and not **air-combat manoeuvring.**

What was that about it this test being about combat maneuvering?


&gt;Bullshit. Changing the software does not reduce the wing loading (and I assume you know what wing loading is, and how it affects flight performance). The F-35 has very high wing loading which causes very poor handling.

Quelaag does not guard the Bell to protect the Bed of Chaos. She guards the bell so she can collect Humanity to use in saving her sister, The Fair Lady. 

The Fair Lady's dialogue (heard with the Old Witch's Ring) implies Quelaag has been using Humanity to heal her sickness. As such, she guards the Bell so she can kill Undead and take their Humanity.

Also, Ceaseless Discharge was oozing lava since he was born, revealed in the Orange Charred's Ring's description. His sisters made the Ring to lessen his pain,  which explains why he get's angry after you take the clothes off one of his sister's corpses.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","I really appreciate how Fleming-esque this movie felt. After the silliness of the Roger Moore era (which in some instances was good and fun), Dalton's darker turn was a breath of fresh air in much the same way that Craig's run of films responded to the failures of the Brosnan movies. Dalton diligently prepared for the role, reading copies of the original novels on set to get a feel for the dark, damaged Bond of Fleming's books. In Licence to Kill, Dalton's research and acting really shone through, as we see him out, not for Queen and country, but revenge for Tracy, Felix, and Della. Dalton's Bond (like Craig's) is one the audience can identify with, which makes Dalton's films more meaningful than their predecessors. I also liked the scene where Bond [kills off Sanchez with the lighter/Leiter.

Choose your nether fort carefully. If you get one over a large lava lake it'll greatly reduce the spawning spaces you'll have to cover up.

Do not use netherbrick slabs. It looks great and all but my efforts were greatly hindered by having to farm netherrack in order to make the bricks. It's still hard for me to just through away stacks of netherrack. 

Flatten out the nether fort so that you can run around quickly and kill things quickly. Wither skeletons won't spawn in the blank spaces between pathways even if you put down a solid block so instead connect these area with a block that prevents mob spawns. Don't use any lights because wither skellies have the same spawn requirements for light as do regular skeletons. 

Set up beacons with at the minimum Strength II (this will allow you to kill anything that spawns in the fortress with a single hit from an unenchanted diamond sword). Regen, Speed, and Resistance are also nice affects to have but not as crucial as Strength II. You may have to google how to set up a beacon in the nether, it's been awhile since I set up mine.","1438387588"

Age: 18

Tier/Division: Gold 4 currently

Position: Mid

Main Champion: Annie.

Secondary Champions: Generally can play most meta picks at at least a standard level, For off meta champs, Lux and Talon come to mind..

Why do you want to join the team?

I honestly had no aspirations to join a ranked team before I just accidentally stumbled upon this subreddit, But it could be a way to improve and playing with a full team worth of communication would be a great experience.

What do you feel you bring to the team?

I tend to have a good game sense when it comes to objectives/rotating around the map, and occasionally I can hit a good spot and show up huge.
List off a known weakness you'd like to improve on: Being able to play well more consistently, I have a tendency to misjudge risk-reward occasionally and die too often when behind, if I don't focus on playing very safe.

Prior Team Experience: Practically none. Very limited experience on a completely casual rank 5 team with like, 2 bronze, 2 golds, and a diamond that I knew all IRL. 

Availability: I have a very flexible schedule, pretty much available whenever I am needed. The practices schedule should be easy to commit too as well.

Mic: Yes.","1438387589"

Even if John is rich and handsome that already opens some doors for him simply because he's rich and handsome.

I think the game of dating is mostly presentation and how you use your words.  If you're looking to get down for a relationship and more than being unemployed probably isn't considered attractive even if Mike is homely, you know?  Mike can spit mad game at any chick and since he's level 99 I assume he knows what to say to get a girl hooked but I'm not sure how long she'll stay.  Truth is, women are diverse.  Different women like different things so maybe women #1 will be attracted Mike for what he offers and women #2 will be attracted to John for what he offers.  Unfortunately, being handsome and rich(er) is much easier to present on first impressions based on how you look, how you dress, car you drive, etc.  I think it's kind of impractical to assign levels for dating levels anyways haha.. especially to compare a 1 to a 99!

"disability","t5_2qhe8","Keep in mind, this date on this article is 1997. Though I admit, the name Share a Smile Becky is pretty nauseating. There is probably a divide between those born disabled and those who become disabled later, in terms of how much their condition has been incorporated into their sense of self identity. I imagine a lot of people born disabled would be more likely to decline a cure for their condition. For them, being cured might be experienced the same way we experienced becoming disabled later in life; they would have to adapt to a profoundly different lifestyle, and it could lead to grief over what they've always known. So while I would love a cure (or even just really effective treatment) I could understand how someone else could balk at the idea. If were born a certain way and felt comfortable with it, and someone came along with a magic pill and said, ""Here, take this. It'll change you so you'll be more acceptable to the rest of us,"" I think it would ruffle my feathers too. To me, disability is about what I have, not what I am as a person.

When Low Info Democrats see it, even people with low double digit IQs like Leftists will be bowled over by Cruz's logic. 

The entire purpose of the modern media is to ensure that nobody sees intelligent, logical arguments.  Because if they did, the Democrat Party would simply cease to be. In a presidential debate, even the modern media would have no choice but to show the unfiltered, unedited responses of both candidates. 

This would be an absolute disaster for Hillary and a home run for Cruz. 

I'd half expect the major networks to have ""technical difficulties"" during Cruz's response to prevent the low info Democrats from being exposed to logic and reason.

"socialskills","t5_2r275","I know the feeling you're referring to and it happens to all of us I reckon, like that feeling you get when they sort of look at you in a funny way after you say or do something. I used to have a similar problem where I would continue cringing and thinking about awkward or embarrassing moments after but I constantly reassure myself that they 1) probably feel the same way about themselves and if not then 2) they never remember what you did (go search up spotlight effect if you want the scientific theory).

In response to your other comment, I think you will continue to fuck up to a small extent for a long while to come, despite telling yourself not to do the same thing next time. Best thing you can do is to remember that they hardly notice and dwelling on it will only make you more nervous and awkward. I still fuck up my handshakes by instinctively avoiding eye contact but I instantly force myself to forget the awkwardness and to continue as if it didn't happen. Same deal with when I say something weird or awkward and it has helped me improve my social skills immensely over the past year.

Remember, it's only awkward if you make it awkward! If you want some examples, try searching for videos where high profile celebrities and politicians have fucked up in front of an audience or camera and watch how they play it off. You'll see how most of the time, it's not awkward! I hope this advice can help you (and anyone else reading this) just as it has helped me.","1438387593"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","At risk of down votes: /r/fatlogic is a pretty good subreddit for cutting the crap and not allowing yourself to make excuses about your weight. Along that line [secret eaters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bYJrC3RTtgQ) is a great program for the same reasons that subreddit works.

Basically those two make it easy to stay on track with the idea of calories in vs calories out. I have a fitbit with a heart rate monitor and use the app to track all my food intake to make sure I'm eating at a rate to lose weight. I'll still eat a slice of pizza but it'll count as [600 calories](http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/14/garden/eating-well-fat-by-the-slice.html) which is fine, it just means I have to adjust for it. Also bought the fitbit scale to record my weight over time on the app.

The second part of the equation is nutrition (fitbit and fatlogic don't adress those directly), eating more fruits, less processed foods, I've also been experimenting with [soylent](https://www.soylent.com/) as a balanced way to get calories in. Ordering more salads, less greasy foods and etc... The good news is healthy foods tend to be more satiating so in a way I almost feel like I'm eating more than I used to.

And the last part is of course excersise, I try to always meet my fitbit step goals, on weekends and days where I work from home that means a visit to the gym just to get my steps in. I'll go on the treadmill and do about 3 miles at 6-7mph (not always at once, sometimes I take a break between miles).


**TL,DR;** I take it as a multiple strategy attack. Count Calories, Exercise more, Eat healthier. It allows me to be lazy on one thing on any given day while still making progress.","1438387594"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Digital cameras: I used to sell them, from the cheap point-and-shoots to the highest-end Canons, Leicas and Hasselblads. If you're looking to buy a camera, just know that pretty much every consumer-grade camera is essentially the same. You could buy a Canon or a Nikon or any other brand and they'd produce photos that would be damn near indistinguishable.

This only changes when you get into pro-level equipment, the kind that costs many thousands of dollars, which 98% of camera buyers are never going to do. Even the small minority that will grow interested in photography enough to try to take their hobby to the next level will only be able to afford to move up to mid-range equipment. That stuff you see people shooting at NFL and FIFA games is a whole other level. News agencies and magazines buy that shit. You won't.

So if you go buy a camera, get something that fits both your hand and your budget. Don't waste time and money on shit you'll never use.

Also: Don't get a dSLR if you hate carrying around a bag of gear when you go out! Cameras like that aren't made for convenience.","1438387594"

"hiphopheads","t5_2rh4c","Okay so, we know that the album is directed at the negro population living in America and the way they're treated and also the way they treat each other.
This track, like *These Walls* is aimed mainly at the selling of sex, but also, it's very similar to *Wesley's Theory* because it talks about money. 
""This Dick Ain't Free"" is a few things. Firstly, it may be a Tupac reference from *Niggaz Nature Reminx* where Tupac says: ""Picture me pay for pussy when the dick’s for free.""
Secondly the meaning behind it is rather simple, men have to pay a price to get pussy (wether it's prostitution or in general) while women can evidently get the dick for free. Which actually ties in to the intro of the lady going off at Kendrick. She talks about how he needs to be successful (and of course it's a very stereotypical success like being a rapper or an athlete) and buy her things. She cares more about the materialistic things Kendrick would have to offer. She also speaks about how if he won't give her these materialistic thing, she can find another man who will. Hence Kendrick saying, multiple times, ""This dick ain't free"". 
This track is actually genius, it does sound very weird to begin with, but a quick read of the lyrics and you can see that Kendrick cares about his people and also wants to bust stereotypes on poverty and sex.","1438387598"

Armed? NK would be destroyed if they posed any threat.

&gt; I might arm the humans of Tibet.

Even if everyone in Tibet was armed they would stand no chance of fighting China and you can't expect that arming them would do anything but instigate an instant and horrific end to Tibet.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","2010 VW Jetta S. My previous car got crashed into and totaled, so I was starting to look around for something new. I already had the Mustang at this point so I was thinking stupidly ""maybe I should just get something comfortable and reliable, I don't need another project or anything. Test drive was uneventful but I didn't really care, the luxuries (heated seats, decent sound system, cruise control, nice interior design, etc..) kinda blinded me to how goddamn boring it was. But again, I was fine with it. I thought I could suck it up and then go drive my crazy car on the weekend and it'd be fine. Within 2 days I was fucking done with it. INTENSE hatred for that pile of shit. 

Let's start with the drivetrain; It came with a 2.5L inline-5, that literally made NO horsepower and guzzled gas anyway. That shit made no sense to me. It made power from like 2600-3000 RPM. You literally had to leave it within a tiny range there to get it moving, otherwise it would just make a bunch of noise (awful sounding revs as well) and not go anywhere. I'm sure I don't have to explain how bad the 'manu-matic' gear selector garbage was, but it was one of the worst I've ever used. I just left it in D after trying it for a day. And then it would turn in 20 mpg flat no matter how much I babied it, so it wasn't even economical! 

Then, the handling... Obviously it cornered like dogshit but that's expected with a long wheelbase and FWD, I wasn't expecting it to be any good. It wasn't even fun though, and there was a HUGE problem with the way the steering worked. It has one of those variable ratios based on the speed you're going. So mid corner the steering angle would just CHANGE! It felt so fucking dangerous. Imagine a reducing radius turn, in a FWD car you'd want to trail-brake into it but with this one you just put more, and more, and MORE, AND FUCKING MORE steering lock into it and it's still just understeering because you're slowing down. So you either had to take turns at speed and desperately hope you can somehow figure out the steering angle through the numb, disconnected steering or you die. Or take turns like a grandma everywhere. Horrifying. 

Throttle response was by wire so there was a maddening delay before the engine moved, and then another delay before the garbage transmission just ate all your power anyway and you wouldn't go anywhere. Brake feel was non-existent.

But the thing that really pushed me over the edge was the fucking automatic electronic bullshit everywhere. As you accelerate, the radio would get louder. In the rain, the wipers would get faster. Everything (just like the steering) was based on the speed you were going, not the conditions or your preferences. You select one thing, and it would just immediately override your choice for whatever the fuck it just decided because you happen to be accelerating. I CAN ADJUST MY OWN FUCKING VOLUME IF I WANT THANKS. It would always go up too loud. It also wouldn't save your last volume when you turn the car off so you'd turn it on and it'd start BLARING.

Sold that piece of shit in under a year for a huge loss because I couldn't stand it anymore, and bought my Saab. Much happier.","1438387601"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I've never really seen it classified as a psychedelic, not by anyone who remotely knew what they were talking about anyway. But I don't see why safety/neurotoxicity is such an issue in terms of its definition; there's nothing in the concept ""psychedelic"" that specifies such conditions. For example, nBOMes are definitely psychedelics, but also far more dangerous than the traditional psychedelics you're taking to be prototypical.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In the thread: What's the most humiliating reason you've ever heard for a teenager to be expelled from school for?

A student at Central High School in Providence, Rhode Island, was suspended for smoking. The school had a no smoking policy.

But, he wasn't smoking. The principal was. He took a picture of her smoking and published it on his web log.

The ACLU got involved and the suspension was lifted but the principal only had to say she was sorry.

TL;DR Power hungry administrators will lie and cheat to keep their power.

If you are beating/spanking her, you could tell her how fucking hot she is when she gets spanked and how hot it makes you, you could tell her how strong she is for being spanked like this, etc.  This line of communication works even with really rough play like non-con stuff.  If you are into being really rough you could comment on how ""annoyingly resilient"" or ""what a strong spirit she has"", something to that effect.

This concept should work with all types of play.  The point is to not step out of character, but still raise her up as you play :)","1438387604"

"rutgers","t5_2risk","Excellent question. To my knowledge the quads don't have AC either. Someone correct me on that if I'm wrong. If you really get too hot, buy a fan. There's nothing special about the quads. Don't get me wrong, it's a great place to live. But the towers are better. As far as walking places goes, you'll be walking to more places than just your classes. You've got the library, dining hall, student center, bus stop (which, guaranteed will be more crowded if you try to get on at the quads stop than the LSC), and virtually every building is closer to the towers than the quads except for the gym. And meeting people on your floor is much easier in the towers mainly because there are more people per floor than the quads. Both the quads and the towers are predominantly freshmen anyway. I met my best friends in the towers. Lived there for two years. Maybe I just have kind of an emotional tie to them. Maybe I just liked waking up 5 minutes before my class in Lucy Stone Hall and still getting there on time. Or the proximity to the library after a late night cram-sesh (which I'd recommend against). Or getting on a bus quicker at the bus stop. Or getting to the dining hall in the nick of time before they closed dinner takeout. Whatever the case may be, I definitely have my biases. I think living in the towers would be your best bet as a freshman and would save you the hassle of trying to switch anyway. You're gonna be living wherever you live for a year. Might as well make it easy on yourself.

I've been on my own weight loss journey over the past year and have gone up and down the scales in the past. Maintenance is definitely difficult. But, on the bright side, you know you've done it before so you can do it again. 

I can't speak for you, but I know that when I was at my highest weight it was difficult to love myself. And if you're looking for intimacy/relationships with others, you need to love yourself first (cliche but true). Taking care of yourself can be a really great way to head in that direction. Even little things like bubble baths or painting your nails can be lovely.

If you're interested in losing weight, it is possible in university - I did it. I started using myfitnesspal religiously to document what I was eating. I also started to really love cooking because it's fun for me and I can track what exactly is going into my body. Also, since you're heading off to uni, beware of alcohol - it's way higher in calories than you'd expect.

"SSBPM","t5_2u3tn","As someone who really appreciates both sides of the argument (I mained Link for a long time, and now I main Bowser, and am starting to use Lucario), I understand why you think like you do.

From the perspective of the spammer (besides easy/very repetitive spam like basic Falco lasers/etc) it's a challenge. I love trying to predict people's approaches and place hitboxes there. It feels just as awesome to correctly predict people's approaches and stop them with projectiles as it does to predict their tech rolls, or land a counter/perfect shield/etc. It's honestly really similar.

I suggest you try to **enjoy the challenge that it is**.

No, it's not easy to try to run through a maze of projectiles, but it **can** be really fun if you treat it like a puzzle or an obstacle course instead of ""work"". You can certainly have fun learning to jump through the hoops, and out-smart your opponent. Try getting them to throw projectiles incorrectly because of your smart movement, or try fighting the projectiles themselves. (trying to cancel them with your attacks).

It teaches you patience, good movement, player habits, execution, etc. The fact that it's hard means the you definitely can learn from it and get better.

Personally, I can't keep up with super fast characters/players. I've never been able to play quickly or do long combos, and it's just frustrating to force myself to play that way. It's super easy for me to think to myself ""Why do they like playing like this? They're just pressing buttons in a way that makes it difficult for me to do anything about it."" It's the same thing to me. People just finding ways that they like to have fun.

People like chain grabbing with Ice Climbers too, and you pretty much can't do anything about it except not get grabbed. It becomes a 1-player game at that point. Basically Smash DDR (not hating on IC players lol) At least you're still playing the game when people are spamming.

"SFGiants","t5_2s5xr","A bit. I subscribe to r/notebooks, r/pens, and r/pencils, but haven't been very active since I finally settled on a few (about 6 months ago).

Pilot G-2's are easy to get and use in the office, but I carry a few Precise's and Uniball Signos at each line-weight (0.7 is my favorite, I really like the Signo 307). I've also got Microns, fineliners, and brush pens that I carry with me but barely use. I really like HAVING colors, I just don't have a USE for them.

I have one, but would never actually buy a Twist-Erase. I used Quicker Clickers for probably two decades before trying out the P200's about a year ago - I pull the clip off because I prefer narrower barrels now. The biggest thing I did was buy softer lead...I'll never use HB lead again, it's 2B or up. I also keep a Blackwing on me.

If they do, tell them that you don't feel the same way. Guys who have feelings for you and are your friends can't just throw those away immediately, even if they know there's not a chance, so give them time to move on.

Note: some people are flirty by nature (I do it unintentionally) and developing feelings for a friend is ok. Friends or not, objectifying is not. If a friend or stranger treats you as an object that's never ok, but let them move on if it's good-intentioned romantic interest.","1438387613"

"brasil","t5_2qh9i","Que eu saiba, o mais importante é achar um emprego que ajude você obter o visto de trabalho. Dai você voltaria à França (ou seu pais de origem) para ir no consulado brasileiro e pedir o visto de trabalho.

Conseguir emprego ""ilegal"" é fácil. Por exemplo, se o seu inglês é bom, não é dificil achar uma escola de linguas que dê trabalho para você. Mas tenha cuidado: um emprego que não vai te ajudar com o visto de trabalho é uma armadilha, já que também não vai te dar beneficios, plano de saude, etc.

Cada certo tempo, Brasil oferece anistia para estrangeiros. Normalmente são destinadas para os bolivianos e chineses em situação de semi-escravidão, mas tem muitos europeus, americanos, etc que aproveitam e se regularizam. As ultimas foram em 1998 e 2009, se não me engano. A proxima, eu imagino, deverá demorar mais alguns anos.

Outra ideia é casar, mas é muito apresado tentar conhecer alguém e casar em poucos meses. 

Se você é homem heterosexual, use camisinha. Muita mulher brasileira vai insistir em não querer usar camisinha. Pensão alimenticia é coisa cara.

Se o seu portugues é bom, poderia tentar entrar uma universidade, e depois tentar o visto de estudante.

E talvez a dica mais importante: muitos brasileiros pensam que todos os estrangeiros estão podres de dinheiro. Cuide seu bolso de ""amigos"" interesseiros.","1438387613"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","1) People don't like other people's Congressmen, which is natural since they represent different districts and/or states with different political sensibilities and interests. People tend to like their own member of Congress because she represents the interests of most of the electorate that actually decides whether or not she gets to keep her seat. 

2) Every member of Congress stands for election against other people. Everyone can think of a more ideal candidate than their current member of Congress but that doesn't necessarily mean that he exists. Most people aren't going to vote to throw out ""good"" because they aren't ""perfect,"" especially when the alternative is that ""bad"" will likely win. 

3) Incumbency and seniority is something that is important. A more seasoned legislator can often be a much more effective advocate for the interests of his district/state than a freshman. Also he made hold a key chairmanship on a major committee of interest to the state/district. Also people tend to stay with someone they know can do a decent job instead of risking it on someone new. Unless a member of Congress is really screwing up (from the perspective of his electorate) it is often hard to convince them that they need to vote him out and try someone new. ","1438387615"

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","&gt;If someone is truly unwilling to see spoilers, they would know not to look on a site specifically made for news and discussion of said topic. If they end up seeing a spoiler on a site that is most likely going to have one, it's not the fault of whomever posted the thread or news story.

I think you're confused as to /r/Gallifrey's aims here. We're for news and discussion about Doctor Who as a whole, **not** for news/discussion about Doctor Who spoilers. We're in the run up to Series 9, of course there's lots of news that gets marked as spoiler, but don't forget...both news and discussion can come in non-spoilery form. Should we expect people to get lost just because they don't wanna see spoilers while the people who do can't be arsed to spend a few extra seconds editing the titles?

&gt;  There is one in particular, not mentioning names (but they're a mod for every DW subreddit I've found, somehow), that over complicates everything and nitpicks everything.

I love you too. &lt;3

But seriously. The rules are pretty simple. In the vast majority of cases, it either conforms to the rules or doesn't. Sure, some may be considered a bit nitpickey, but that helps keep it simple. What do you expect me to do if I see a post that I don't believe conforms to the rules? Leave it so people don't think I'm anal about it?

Not removing a thread that breaks the rules only makes it worse in the long-run. People will get more confused as to what the rules actually are, people will start bending the rules even further, people will start giving us a bollocking for removing their post but not other people's.

I like to keep the words ""I'm here to moderate not to tolerate"" in my mind a lot.

&gt;Don't ruin it for us; don't come here if you know you don't want to see 3/4 of the content.

&gt;Most are very lenient, just are almost never the ones to approve.

I don't understand where you keep getting these completely unsourced ""facts"" from? (I feel another refuting script or two coming along....)

Look on the home page. Less than 1/5 is marked spoiler. That's not even close to 3/4. 

(Although I don't get why simply asking you to keep spoilers out of titles is ruining it for you.)

I don't know where you even got the idea about moderator activity since these can only be accessed by mods. Unless, of course, you've done a lot of stalking and putting some pieces together. (If you really wanna know...I've only removed 2 submissions in the past week for being spoiler).

There are many of us here who have had our lives turned upside-down by CFS. A few are in high school and a few more are college aged. All of us suffer from various degrees of disability, which varies from life-altering to bedbound.

It's hardest when you are young, and you have no support from the people you depend upon. It's a situation that can leave you isolated, scorned, and without access to the help which can make your situation better.

Chances are quite good that your situation can be made better. I'd like to know a little bit more about what you are up against.

"landscaping","t5_2qndi","I was in a very similar position to you when I purchased my home in late '12. My move-in inventory was as follows:

* Broken sprinkler system
* Decrepit swing set (splinters and spiders galore)
* Janky ""vegetable garden"" bordered by collapsing chain link and cemented green tree stakes
* Overgrown rock beds
* Wood-burning fire pit built directly on top of a tree stump
* Old cement pathway (like an old incinerator pathway) bisecting the back lawn into two halves 

&amp;nbsp;

Now, I didn't move states like you did, but I moved away from home and it was a BIG change ascetically. My father is an avid gardener and landscaper and has a beautiful backyard complete with two decks, two perimeter rock walls, and perennials everywhere. The entire reverse side of his back fence is his vegetable garden, so we always had edibles to boot. Needless to say, it was a shock to live in such a decrepit and depressing atmosphere, even though I do like my house and neighborhood. 

&amp;nbsp;

Flash forward to now: I've removed the stump, the fire pit, the concrete, the swingset, the sandbox, the cemented garden posts, the rock bed, and the chain link. It's gone. I fixed the sprinkler system, re-did the front yard, redefined the backyard sod area, planted three trees in the back, installed a new patio paver, and am about 50% of the way building my own Cedar pergola. I'm not gushing, because Lord knows I'll never be in Better Homes and Gardens. I'm just so pleased that I have the opportunity, not only to own a house, but to make it my own and invest in something that represents so much: sweating my ass off, compromising with my wife, feeling sore after a day's work, spending quality time with my father and father-in-law, and being outside and feeling the sunshine on my back.

&amp;nbsp;

There's no shame in hiring a designer to be the brains of your operation. There are so many variables to entertain: budgets, weather, personal interest, structures, individual specimen, time frame, etc. I hired a designer to draw the plan that became the basis for what I did. That being said, because I was the sweat and blood, and because my preferences and ideas matured in 8 months between the plan and the work, I had the opportunity to make my yard my own and make my own designs too. 

&amp;nbsp;

So...go for it! Hire a designer if you want, but I truly truly recommend that you take a stab at some of the projects yourself. The way I look at it: when it comes to dollars and cents, you can fuck up once and THEN do it right the second time, and that will still cost less than paying a pro to do it once. And your rewards are almost spiritual as much as they are material.

"heroesofthestorm","t5_2ym13","&gt; Imposing Presence is a great pick against AA heavy team comps, hugely improving your team fight and survivability. Recently I've been going Renewed Swing 60-70% of the time, Imposing Presence the other 40-30%.

I've yet to test it with other AA based heroes, but Valla seems to really counter Leoric that hard, that you should pick Imposing Presence **just for her**.

[Giant Killer + 10% movement speed from her trait + Q/E/Q escape &amp; self heal](https://www.heroesfire.com/hots/talent-calculator/valla#l2n4) just wrecks any plays that you want to make.

Maybe the Leoric that I faced was **really** bad, but I could easily handle him 1on1 [I was the only AA hero and by the ""AA heavy team comp"" logic he didn't pick imposing presence...]..
  
Have you faced off against that build and what was your experience?

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I absolutely agree that people get trapped into monogamy because they don't realise that it's not the best strategy for everyone - and then they feel like they've 'failed' in some way.  Monogamy is 100% biologically oriented towards raising offspring - hell, all of evolution is about raising viable offspring - which really throws one off when they are a I-don't-want-children-bisexual-female (hello!).  So if the whole social structure is about raising offspring, then why are gay or lesbian people [presumably] monogamous?  Or people who are infertile or don't want kids?  It's because we didn't evolve to accomodate our personal preferences - as a species we've evolved to make sure our babies survive.  If we opt out of that whole thing, then what's left?  Conversations on reddit about how the system doesn't work for us.  :)  

My original response to your post wasn't trying to defend monogamy as an institution (as I don't) but explain how it might've evolved.  And I definitely agree with you that monogamy, socially, doesn't seem to make people happy.  When they're all-eyes-for-each-other of course it isn't a problem to promise ""forever"" and ""only you""!  It's once that feeling passes and you're left with a mortgage and shared friends and kids and weight gain that we end up forcing ourselves to stay, when we arbitrarily made some promise 15-50 years before.  I agree that people should be monogamous if they want, but it isn't sustainable, and when people make the promise, they forget that.  My option is to just opt for something that is sustainable, tell my partner that at the very beginning, enjoy our one-on-one time, and then as we start to get bored of one another sexually, why give up the amazing connection we have otherwise just because each of us wants to get our rocks off with someone else?

"funny","t5_2qh33","Either I wasn't clear, or you are confused with what I meant. Let me clarify. I was not 'crying misandry', I actually supported the action. I gave an experience that was relevant to the conversation, and nothing else. 

Lets look at it though. Imagine you are on the board of a charity that supports human development and self-sufficiency. You have a budget of say... 100k. Obviously the goal of a charity like that is to reach as many people as possible and lift them out of poverty/ prepare them for independent living. I don't have any statistics memorized, but a significant portion of homelessness is made up of minorities, abused women, and single parent families. Most single parent families are headed by a single mother, so if you were to help that woman, you'd also be giving her children a chance to break the cycle of poverty and lift themselves out. Just like a company, you want to help the maximum amount of people for the lowest price. So, charities that center on abuse shelters, or families, or minorities are the best places to donate (after considering factors such as overhead, percent of success, ect). 

If statistics say (using random numbers here) 70% of people fall into the before-mentioned categories, why would you help out the 30%? Yes, they need help. Yes, you want to help 100%. But you only have so much money. That's how people fall through the cracks. So all those women's shelters are better funded than male shelters simply because there are more women in need. And most women's shelters do not allow men because they want to create the safest place possible for their people (many have never had a non-abusive male in their life). The reasons are all valid, but it does mean that some people (white, mentally stable, male) will have a harder time getting help.

"fantasyfootball","t5_2qlqq","As an Eagles fan, I have to greatly disagree with your assessment of Agholor.

&gt;Another young receiver with lots of hype that likely won't live up to it. While he has many of the same measurables of Jeremy Maclin, who excelled in Philly last year, he might not get many opportunities to show off said measurables this year.

He is going to be starting, unless Miles Austin somehow gets that spot or if for some reason, Jordan Mathews ends up starting (which would go against all reports that are coming out). 


&gt; Chip Kelly's offense is loaded, as Cooper, Matthews, and Huff may all be above him on the depth chart.

If you go over to the Eagles sub, many think Huff is going to be a breakout candidate. But I don't see it. He looked underwhelming last season, and was considered a reach for the third round. The Ducks connection was likely a big reason Chip even got him on the Eagles. Cooper might be starting though, because of his blocking ability. Mathews, as I already mentioned is more likely to remain a slot receiver, as Chip loves his size in that role. 

&gt;But he just isn't a smart draft pick as early in the draft as I've seen him go.

I think you are getting a bargain if you can get him in the 9th or 10th round. He is set to start right off the bat and be featured in that Maclin role. Rotoworld even considers him to be the 2nd best rookie WR, behind Amari Cooper. I would definitely take him over Charles Johnson. 

On a side not, Jordan Mathews is being over drafted IMO. He is most likely going to start the year off in the slot. I am seeing him going as early as the 5th round in 10 team drafts. 

And also for Zach Ertz,
&gt;Ertz has been hyped up as a breakout TE the past couple seasons, yet fallen short, and it's happening again this season.

He was hyped up last season only. He is going into his third year. There was really no fantasy hype around him his rookie season, and there should not have been for a rookie TE drafted in the 2nd round. 
I do agree though his fantasy upside is handcuffed by his lack of blocking. But I also expect him to have improved this season. I would pass on him at his current ADP. The third year TE that I would be targeting is Tyler Eifert late. In the mocks I've been doing, I seem to draft Jordan Cameron/Owen Daniels and Tyler Eifert/Walker. ","1438387630"

"StreetFighter","t5_2qnu5","Learn how to get in and apply offensive pressure. Sakura is best at a close range where she can do big damage. Anywhere else, Sakura suffers from a very bad fireball and average normals. She wants to get in or else her lack of a good fireball just makes her lose the ground game to anyone to characters like Ryu or Ken. Also, because none of her normals really stand out as a good normal to use in the ground game and the fact that her fireball can't be used to zone anyone out, she'll just lose the ground game to characters with better normals like Fei Long. 

With that said, because anywhere other than close range, she suffers, learn how to apply pressure once you do get in. Learn how to do counter-hit setups and to finish your combos. Use your tatsu to apply pressure, it's safe on block. Also, always end your combos with ex tatsu and do your sakura otoshi afterward (the 3 hit version of j. hp) but only do the 2nd hit. Not the 3rd. What this allows you to do is after the sakura otoshi, you can do a charged fireball and what that does is that it gives you so many options. After the fireball, you can jump and do a normal, you can do an overhead, you can do a counter-hit setup and it basically lets you apply offensive pressure for free. 

More importantly, is learning how to get in. Never use Sakura's shoryuken on wakeup. It's terrible and very slow, use ex version if you need to do a reversal. Anyway, as Sakura, you wanna inch forward little by little and pressure your opponent into the corner because that's where you can get your offensive momentum down. If the guy fireballs, you neutral jump and walk forward slightly. Because the guy has to recover after throwing the fireball, he can't do anything about your walking forward and this lets you close the distance and just walk forward until he either throws another fireball or you're in a close enough distance to apply that pressure. This basically leaves the opponent to either back off and gain space until he hits the corner or let you close the distance for free. 

Against opponents with good normals like Fei Long, you want to understand what their main tools of controlling space is. For Fei Long, his space control tool is using his rekkas and cr. mp or cr. hp. Understand this and try to predict when the opponent will use their tool to control space. Then, by predicting the tool try to instantly get in and out of the range of the tool. Bait it out so that you can either punish the recovery time of it or walk forward during the recovery time. That's how you usually get in.","1438387632"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","I've done it twice so here are some lessons learned.

* If there's anything on the site (i.e. trees) you don't want them to clear, go with them to the site and tag stuff. Ask that they inform you when clearing will start so you can be there to monitor the work/ensure they don't clear what you want to keep. Swing by/monitor the site ahead of that date in case they start earlier and forget to tell you.

* Line any well casing with schedule 40 PVC. Our well casing recently developed a hole because of rust and we lost prime. Because we had a PVC liner, we replaced the above ground items with PVC, reprimed, and were back in business.

* Ensure no construction trash under the sod. Don't trust them to do this. Find out when the sod will be installed and gather everything into the construction dumpster ahead of that date.

* Once the lot is cleared, visit every single day or as often as you can at the end of the day to inspect that day's work. Outline stakes for the slab placed? Chalk outlines for walls drawn? Measure everything against the plans. First house we built, the slab was one foot off font and back (larger thankfully). At the second, they outlined the kitchen wall too far out which would have made a too skinny hallway and they didn't pick up the trash but we did ahead of sod placement. I missed them not running electrical to the kitchen island, so they had to cut into the slab to fix it. 

The thing is to catch and fix stuff as it happens so the mistake isn't taken to the next level of construction. By inspecting every evening, you have a manageable amount of work to inspect and can email your builder the latest action items. Keep that list of actions up to date and see each one to closure. Mistakes happen so you're not trying to poke them in the eye with the actions, just make them aware of the issues (helping them help you). ","1438387634"

&gt; Is it possible to use versioned base-boxes w/o making it publicly available now?

Yeah. They've now documented the [metadata format](http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/format.html), so you just need a way to provide access credentials for your private stuff if you don't want it publically available.

"news","t5_2qh3l","Not true. Disneyland is private property which is owned and operated by a for profit corporate business with specific rules that apply to all park patrons. When you purchase an admission ticket, you have legally agreed to abide by those rules (Whether you realize it or not), including the ones covering the required fees and agreements related to events such as weddings that take place within the park property.

These individuals attempted to game the system by intentionally violating the park rules. They might have gotten away with it if they hadn't posted details of the ceremony on a public media website along with the admission that they planned the entire thing so as to avoid paying the standard fee to Disney. 

If they are foolish enough to try fight Disney in a court of law when they are eventually sent a bill, they are guaranteed to lose.

There are so many other variables that go into these stats, such as stafford taking over a 0-16 team vs. a QB who was allowed to develop and grow behind and legendary QB like rodgers did. If rodgers had inherited the 0-16 lions and started right away i do not believe he would have won a superbowl. As it was mentioned above, the only correct conclusion that can be made from this data is that stafford is still young.

Basically, what the article says isn't enough on its own to imply that pointers can point to registers but it was enough to strongly remind me both of that fact and of reaching that from the same direction some time before (possibly reading the same article).

I still don't understand what you're saying.

In C, a pointer *cannot* point to a register (unless the compiler does something outside the scope of the language standard). That's the whole point of the required diagnostic if you try to take the address of a `register`-qualified object.

Logically, an ordinary C variable whose definition doesn't include the `register` keyword has an address (i.e., you can construct a pointer to it). The compiler may optimize the code so that it's never stored in memory, and explicitly taking its address may inhibit that optimization, but that doesn't affect the semantics of the program.

A variable defined with `register` can also be stored either in a CPU register or in RAM (or nowhere if it's not used) -- but the language forbids taking its address (as nearly as C forbids anything).

The C language itself doesn't even acknowledge the existence of CPU registers (the spelling of the `register` keyword notwithstanding).","1438387643"

He doesn't stop it.  If you watch your friend get raped and do nothing to stop it but have all the power to, you're as much the cause as the offender. 

&gt;Earthquakes are evil?

You really don't read what I write, do you?  As I said before, inherently they are unpleasant things.  BUT, if there's a creator behind them, then they *are* evil, because they could just as readily have not existed. 

&gt;lmao, you're really scraping the bottom of the barrel now.

Nice straw man, I'm noticing you refer to him more and more without anything new to say. 

&gt;By the way, guess who brought those people into __this world__? Everytime you bring up ""people"", ""babies"", ""population"" or anything to do with humans, I'll bring up the n-word, i.e. natalism, and direct you to Vallicella's PoE for atheists.

I've bolded the words above that you fail to address.  As I said before, natalism, if it's a problem at all, is only a subset of the problems brought on by an evil/douchebag god (assuming one exists). 

&gt;What on earth does God's identity have to do with how he relates to a possible state of affairs?

Great question.  Why the hell does it matter that we know what ""good"" is?  Why can't things just have been ""good"" without knowing it?  They certainly could have been *worse*, and we don't much lament that they aren't. 

&gt;And what's with this strawman ying-ying nonsense you keep bringing up?

I'm sorry summarizing your arguments is being considered straw manning now.  Maybe you should refine them or address my question above about *why* it would matter that we know what evil/good even is.

&gt;""Humanity"", lmao. The natalist is so blinded by his hypocrisy it's almost saddening. 

Ah, ad hominem, I was wondering when you'd show up.  You sound crazier and crazier with each reply.  I'm starting to think this will reflect poorly on your credibility here. 

&gt;Your appeals to emotion and insistence that the human race is populated by inherently good, morally mature people is laughable.

A) The argument doesn't depend on inherently good people; only whether it's Good to torture some of them (by means of a shitty world). 

B) Not an appeal to emotion, not even sure which part of what I said has to do with emotion. 

C) You didn't answer my point at all, and instead went pure ad hominem.  -1 point to the non-responder. 

&gt;""Morons"". Here we go with natalism back again in full force.

I only consider you a moron if you fail to defend your claims (see above) and believe in something that has been demonstrably discredited without further retort.  It's up to you represent yourself.  

Nice ad hominem again too.  It's weird, do you think all people are natalists or something?  Nothing I've said has even implied once that I support natalism in any form.  Hell, I'm pro-choice.","1438387644"

* Don't be afraid to say no to drinking/drugs/etc, but college IS the best time to experiment with that IMO. Obviously don't do anything stupid or irresponsible, and there's no need to ever do anything more than drinking/weed/MAYBE shrooms or acid. If you do choose to do that, know your limits. If you've never drank before, take it slow and ease yourself into it, you'll find your limit eventually. 

* Go to class.

* Go to class.

* GO THE FUCK TO CLASS.

* Don't eat shit all the time, because now you don't have people to tell you that you can't. 

* Be responsible for yourself and your actions, because you don't have anyone to take the fall for you.

* Be social! One of the best parts of college is finding a group of friends that will seriously last for the rest of your life. Don't let that go to waste by sitting in your room alone. Every freshman is in the same position as you: they don't know a lot of people if anyone and want to make friends. All you have to do is interact nicely, it's really that simple. And if you weren't the most popular kid in high school? Fuck it. Reinvent yourself completely. Fake that confidence until you internalise it. If you were a social kid in high school?

"nyc","t5_2qhu2","But what happens when more and more jobs can be automated? Do we just let more and more people fall into poverty because we love jerking our ""you didn't work hard enough"" boners? What happens when office jobs begin to go? What happens when the majority of jobs left are the people maintaining these machines and we only need a fraction of the human workers we once needed? 

Sure, these minimum wage jobs shouldn't be career goals, but it goes much deeper than just not trying hard enough in school. There is a deep, [systematic problem in this country](http://www.npr.org/2012/01/16/145175694/legal-scholar-jim-crow-still-exists-in-america) in regards to keeping people of color from fully participating and engaging with society in a way that enables them to reach higher. Obviously it's not all African Americans, some can make it, just like other people of every color can just not give a shit and make terrible choices which leads to a terrible life. We underfund low income schools in all sorts of ethnic neighborhoods, and when you grow up without a sense of what it means to really be a part of the country you live in you lack the skills and mindset necessary to really go further than the life you were born into. 

This happens in poor white neighborhoods as well. Kids grow up with parents, who were probably raised the same way, who feed them McDonald's like it's a valid daily meal, and who work a shitty job just to keep their families from being homeless. Over time it becomes a [vicious cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycle_of_poverty) that, while not entirely inescapable, is incredibly efficient at keeping people at exactly the same social level that they were born at. 

Again, I'm not saying this is the root cause of every shitty employee, at every shitty fast-food joint, but people need to understand that not everyone who works a crap job is there because they had all the opportunities of a middle-class youth but squandered them due to some sort of blinding shortsightedness. We are a country that was founded on the principle of hard work, but we've evolved into a country where there are people everywhere who were dealt a [shitty hand](http://previews.123rf.com/images/gunter_nezhoda/gunter_nezhoda1009/gunter_nezhoda100900007/7720293-seven-deuce-worst-starting-hand-in-texas-hold-em-poker-Stock-Photo.jpg) from the get go, and the odds are incredibly slim that they will have the knowledge, resources, and focus to make it into our desperately sinking middle class.

I don't want to make anyone who's worked hard for what they have feel attacked, but I think that we all need to fess up to the fact that our beloved system of ""work hard, move up"" isn't working exactly like it should. It's a race issue, it's a class issue, and it's a fundamental power structure issue, but the more we pretend that every unfortunate career burger flipper simply didn't apply himself enough the more we fool ourselves into thinking that we still live in a country of equal opportunity the easier it is to look down from our two bedroom house at the homeless veteran outside and think ""God, why doesn't he just take some computer classes or something.""","1438387644"

The secret is to strain the broth with a cheese cloth to get that fine clear appearance.  Add your spices and peppercorns on the second round of cooking and strain when the taste is to your liking.  Lastly, everybody into the pool- noodles, extra thin sliced raw (optional) beef (it cooks in seconds in the hot broth), scallions, and some thinly sliced thai peppers.  Well then, now I'm hungry!","1438387647"

Oh, and it's the same ""solid V8 engine"" whether you get a decommissioned patrol car or not. The 4.6 Modular V8 is the only engine in these cars (Grand Marquis, Crown Victrola, and Town Car) since 1992 at least.  The only difference between a cop car and a civilian car is the ECU and the alternator; also the coolant hoses and some other little bits.  The ECU in the cop car does not look for the PATS security key.  I ran one in my car for awhile since mine only came with one key and I'll be damned if I'm gonna pay $150 for an ignition key.  I ditched it when I discovered that the police ECU also doesn't expect there to be an electronic traction control system, so it disregards it.  Cop cars usually, but not always, have a Trac-Loc rear (limited slip differential).  For now, I'm living with the single PATS key.","1438387649"

And these friendships are just so important, so don't sacrifice those to be someone you aren't. However, know that the magic community is hoooooostile to women in a lot of ways. A lot of the people who are part of that community are *not* people who have anything going on in their lives, and can make **anybody** uncomfortable. The unfortunate consequence of being part of that community is being associated with the loud and worst of what that community has to offer. Call those dumbfucks out for being assholes. Don't start fights, but have a hard line on the behavior you'll tolerate, and make sure misogyny is not one of those tolerated behaviors.

The trick is to not expect to meet a girlfriend anywhere, but make friends with as many people as possible who do what you enjoy. And the real question is, are you happy where you're at? If you are, then you're doing college right.

After posting my stories I met someone who introduced me to THOTH's Emerald's tablets, he told me I need to read this, its the story of us.  After reading the tablets I realized the rules I came up with to help me handle a life of pain 24/7 was the same advice THOTH speaks in the emerald tablets.  

Darkness/Suffering/Struggle are all tools to help your fire [soul] grow bright.  Once you struggle enough in this world you realize there are no more problems because you've dealt with worse.  Your fire is so bright after suffering so much that darkness can no longer affect you.   Now life is simply an amazing journey to search to the unknown.  Knowledge that is out there but is hidden.  

After a soul reaches great happiness all it wants to do is spread the word how to achieve such a life of wonder in a world filled with darkness.  Realize the struggle is there for you, not to punish you but to force you to learn about yourself [your strengths, your weaknesses] so you may grow strong.  In the end you realize this life is the most wonderful gift the gods could have given us.  

If anyone is interested in THOTHs words please check out his tablets:

Always doing the right thing is a great idea, but it means nothing if you don't actually have the foresight to see the big picture. Which Ned didn't, but Rhaegar did. 


It will be very hard to have an actual discussion if you disagree with the reality that right and wrong is a culturally influenced set of norms and taboos, not a universal ruleset. We as readers have our own cultural biases and personal morals, so we identify with or dislike certain characters. But many mistake their opinion with an observation. Beliefs are not facts. We can make arguments about who is doing the right or wrong thing but those are opinions and if we don't base them on certain simple criteria, then it's all arbitrary. We are discussing a fantasy series about humanity struggling to survive amidst themselves while the impending forces of cold and darkness threaten their very existence. The simple objective criteria for this series should be: Does this help or hurt humanity's chances to survive?


That was the question Rhaegar asked himself with every decision because he could see past his own nose. Ned only ever thought about ""doing the right thing"". Ned's endless insistence on being honorable and good didn't actually end up doing a lot of good. His obsession with honor blinded him to reality and endangered people around him.

The video doesn't back up ANY of this guy's statement. I'm not going to lie, I have been 100% pro cop throughout all the media blasting after all these bad situations that many cops have gone through, but after watching the Cincinnati cop shoot that guy in the face, I honestly became sick to my stomach and noticed how easy it is for a cop to be dishonest and very possibly could have gotten away with it if it weren't for a body cam!

I read this headline and thought, ""god damnit, here we go again! For the second time this week!? Another group of insanely corrupt cops!"" Then I actually watched the video and realized that it seems to be just more bait to get uneducated assholes to go against cops!

There's no doubt that there are good guys and bad guys when it comes to both your average Joe and cops, but IMHO the worst people of all, are the ass hats that report and/or comment on situations like these without actually checking the facts. I'm not saying I know all the facts, but before I form an opinion, I at least do a bit of research!

Everyone...just please do us all a favor and either STFU, or figure out what you're talking about before you actually speak...also, if you interact with a cop, JUST STFU AND DO WHAT THEY SAY!!!!! Don't resist, and if you've truly done nothing wrong, you'll be just fine. Seems to me that all too many people who get in trouble with the law forget the first thing said to them when they are actually arrested. You have the right to remain silent!!!

"kancolle","t5_2yjji","Three questions.

1. How will you negotiate potential waifu wars? There's one (free) ring and 24 admirals. 
2. On that note, should that account reach maximum ship slot capacity, what if an admiral decides to scrap a waifu of another admiral?
3. When you say each admiral will be in charge of a fleet of Kanmusu (6), do you mean 6 unique ships? If yes, that adds up to 144 ships which is beyond the 100 free capacity. 

Fascinating proposal and I've seen how crazily amusing twitch plays Pokémon is. It'll be even more interesting if this project can somehow be done in the same way, where people can pop in as and when they want to see what different admirals do. I'm just wondering if logistically this will work out for as they say, *""too many cooks spoil the broth""* or in this case, ""*too many admirals spoil the girls*"". In both ways.

"EliteDangerous","t5_2vi60","&gt; you can review and regret your actions in retrospect, regardless of how much you enjoyed them at the time.

Absolutely! We all can and do change our minds over time. Nothing wrong with that, as long as we're honest about it rather than pretending what we know or do now is how it was all along. When you start to ""retcon"" is where you run into issues.

&gt; ... and writing his own review is his prerogative.

Indeed, this was never in dispute. The facts and motivations behind some of the statements made in it, however, are highly questionable, and nothing is beyond criticism, that includes criticism. I'm amazed how often people in the internet expect to post criticism, and then are surprised when other people cast a critical eye on what they posted. There's nothing wrong with pointing out the problems with the review.

I think the comments about 1.3 and the forum mods are kind of telling. When someone posts a negative review of a game and mentions moderators, they're reviewing more than the game itself, and their motivations are a bit suspect. This kinda reeks of a ""revenge review"" or ""protest review"".

The recent patch and events in the forums have left a bad taste in this reviewer's mouth, so now they're flinging every little piece of muck they can. Sure, they can do that, but when some of the accusations don't seem to jibe with their apparent past opinions and behavior (e.g. hundreds of hours vs. no content and no fun after a ""short time""), don't expect people to not take note.

It just doesn’t work with our design goals of a meaningful death penalty, travel times, etc. The game’s battles, whether 1:1 or 200:200, need to matter.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; having an entirely separate consciousness

This is the key.  Most people with DID won't know about the other identities, at least at first.  Whereas people with gender identity issues are aware of it.  They might only ""feel"" like they are another gender, but the other gender doesn't ""take over"" (like in Fight Club, when Brad Pitt and.... uh... What's-his-face are talking in the hotel room).

With DID, the ""other"" personalities have completely different personalities.  They have different desires.  Different issues.  Different mannerisms.  They, for all intents and purposes, are a different person.

Even other dissociative disorders that have a hint of DID are like this, in that the other ""personalities"" sort of take over.

Also, I didn't use quotes as if I was questioning DID, I am definitely NOT doing that.  DID is a very real issue and other personalities is well documented.  Some people feel it's not real, and that's fine for them.  But people who have gone through it have a very different experience, so I don't want anyone to think I'm belittling that experience.

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","&gt; it is not fundamentally distinct from any other fiat currency.

The opposite of this is true.  

Bitcoin is fundamentally distinct from every other fiat currency.  

_Fiat money is currency which derives its value from government regulation or law_

Bitcoin is not fiat.  There is no government or law stating this MUST be exchanged for goods and services public or private.

Bitcoin's monetary quantity is set in stone and cannot be changed without consensus (better chance an asteroid hitting us and destroying all life on earth) therefor it can be considered a collectible digital token (digital gold).

Bitcoin can be considered a store of value.  If you read this article https://ideas.aeon.co/viewpoints/brett-scott-on-what-is-money (author: The Heretic's Guide to Global Finance: Hacking the Future of Money) he states that

&gt;Imagine a Coca Cola bottle with Coke in it. That bottle is a store of value. If I open it and drink the Coke, it will kickstart energy processes in my body and help me to carry on surviving. Now imagine a piece of paper next to the bottle that says ‘whoever holds this is entitled to claim this bottle of Coke’. That’s a claim on value. If a group of people come to believe in the validity of that claim, the note can be passed around as a means to metaphorically ‘transfer’ Coke value. That’s then a form of money.

&gt;The fundamental difference between the note and the Coke can be tested by a simple experiment. Burning them. Imagine I drop the Coke into a furnace and it evaporates away. Nobody can ever drink it now, and we have destroyed value. The note is simultaneously rendered meaningless. It’s just a piece of paper saying you can claim a non-existent thing.

&gt;Now imagine that instead of incinerating the Coke, I burn the note instead. The Coke remains, and no value is destroyed. All that has happened it that I’ve destroyed my claim to that value.  

From this definition of money, one can plug in Bitcoin's feature list and come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is a claim on value and not a store of value.  I disagree based on how bitcoin actually works.  A burned bitcoin private key renders the bitcoin value it references virtually destroyed.  If you don't understand why that is watch this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZloHVKk7DHk

In his analogy of a claim on a coke bottle and the actual coke, imagine if there was an invisible hand that automatically destroyed the actual coke bottle when a claim paper is burned.  That is Bitcoin.

edit:  I didnt explain why that is important.  It is because a good way to preserve wealth is to actually hold the collectibles in your hands and not depend on someone else holding it for you (think Great Depression, Cyprus, Greece, Venezuala, USA (2% inflation every year is healthy! (until you see the 5 year charts))).

Bitcoin is like an expensive painting, gold, an antique watch.  The value of these items go up in time.  They are rare and collectible. Owning a bitcoin is like owning a bar of actual gold, not a piece of paper that promises you your gold is somewhere. (The ironic part is, a private key is an actual claim on the value of a set number of inputs on the blockchain, so in technology terms, it is a claim on value; in monetary terms, it is a store of value)

Bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, instantly.

Bitcoin cannot be counterfeit.

So, in closing.

&gt; it is not fundamentally distinct from any other fiat currency.

The opposite of this is true.  

*Bitcoin is fundamentally distinct from every other fiat currency.*

"AsianMasculinity","t5_30c2m","/r/CCJ888 

See this extensive guide for a subreddit to mock Asian men.  This is careful work of someone who cares for linguistic detail.  Proper use of formatting and irreverent humor littered throughout the post.  It got me thinking about those who run these institutions that discriminate against Asians.

http://np.reddit.com/r/CCJ888/comments/3dsp92/guide_to_the_real_ccj%E4%BF%A1_a_resource_for_newfags_v01/

&gt; Scattered among the numerous English teachers are bankers, lawyers, doctors, familiar YouTube faces, and several Jews. Watch out for the Jews. 

The use of irreverent, sarcastic humor as a defense for Jews (along with subtle choosing of their most stereotypical professions), and parasitically aligning themselves with whites, is them.  When you become aware of race, you begin to learn the subtle differences.  Some of you are aware of HBD and the Dark Enlightenment, but I will refrain from posting those topics today.  To understand Western Imperialism properly, you must understand Jewish history and Jewish genetics.  They've written extensively on it, and they spend great efforts to catalog it.

You also become familiar with Jewish humor.  It's different than white humor.  Just like black humor, Redneck humor and so on all have unique flavors.  And when you see rampant Jewish irreverent humor, and displayed is verbal expertise in attempts to bash Asian men with a natural level of shamelessness that is rarely found among East Asians, become aware that it's going to be Jews most of the time.  Jews are referred to as ""opportunistically white"".  A Jewish man is Jewish, unless he is trouble or facing an attack he must subvert.  Then he becomes white, and [vice versa since there's no end to their hypocrisy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh8mUia75k8).  You will see this in the media all the time.  We are all taught about the horrors of white men and their role in slavery.  Are you guys aware that it was Jews?  Why is that never mentioned, and why aren't they bearing the costs of slavery?  So to become aware of your environment, you must learn to distinguish Jews from whites.  

Which academic institutions are under the most Jewish control?  [The answer is the one that discriminates the most severely against Asians.](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/eliteenrollment-large.jpg)  Which industry is best known for Jewish influence?  Hollywood is the most hateful institution to use propaganda against Asians.  It took me awhile to understand this, because I grew up in a society where any negative thoughts towards Jews, including those who are racists or even pedophiles, was systematically associated with antisemitism and the Holocaust.  Some of you've abandoned Uncle Channery and become aware of your own race.  Do not end your enlightenment at the immature stage of hating some generic white nobody who says racist things to you.  White people actually do not hold disproportionate power in the US.  Another group of non-whites do.  Learn about the race that has used their institutions to declare Asians as their enemy.  They have many times betrayed the white population of their wealth to protect themselves, including during the 2008 financial collapse.  If you allow them, they will do worse to you.

It's been explained to me before by the specialists that this is often the case, and trying to get the patient to cooperate for the first few years of treatment can be very difficult. 

The drugs half life does not necessarily reflect the time in which it has its effect. I do believe the last endocrinologist I was placed with said he adjusts a patients does and waits 3 months to see the effect of the new dose. 

I'm sure your concern about doctors ability to do maths is valid. But just be objective about it. Your condition is not 'mistreatment' or 'medical incompetence' etc... This is part of the management of what you have. ","1438387656"

I've had pour-overs that I thought were bad (not extracted right, or just a boring bean) that I still think of 'good coffee' because they were experimenting with a new bean or recipe or just somehow pushing the envelope - there was something to be appreciated in it.","1438387657"

Then ""twist-tie"" the resulting double-wire to lock in place on each end.

Finally, twist/clump the wire together to form a handlesque shape and tightly wrap some shit around it to make it fit a standard hand or prosthesis if you don't have a hand.  A hand towel would work, but you may not have any handy, because of the prosthesis.

Voila, a shitty, ugly handle, but a handle nonetheless.

The nice thing about running a baremetal FreeNAS box is that you don't need vt-d support or other virtualization hardware features, so you could go with a lower cost i3 or even Pentium CPU.

If you want something quiet and low power, look in to Avoton SoC boards (mobo and CPU come as a single unit), they're priced pretty well and are surprisingly powerful.

If you'd rather not self build, consider looking in to something like an HP Microserver. Gen8 is nice but a Gen7 would still do just fine, and they have 4 drive front loading HDD bays like the Synology.

Not that Synology are in any way a bad choice, but there are definitely cost effective alternatives out there. It comes down to what you want, and if you'd rather keep tinkering or initial setup to a minimum then there's a lot to be said for things like Synology or QNAP units, and all things considered they're priced pretty well if you choose the right one. But if you want bang for your buck and don't mind putting in a little work (FreeNAS really isn't as daunting as it may seem), I'd heavily suggest investigating self builds etc. more thoroughly.","1438387659"

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","Coptering was one of the easiest things to do in Warfame and in general. It only had two real issues.

1. Reliance on weapon used
2. Inertia trapping you in walls for a few seconds

Now however, there are a bunch of new issues brought with the new parkour system that limit usability:

1. You have to use all of your jumps in order to go as fast as possible. This puts a height restriction on you, which makes Parkour 2.0 nearly unusable in tight corridors and hallways unlike coptering.
2. It's more complex in terms of input (the fastest way I've found to go is sprint -&gt; jump -&gt; slide -&gt; jump -&gt; glide + spam melee which is more complex than sprint -&gt; jump -&gt; copter) while being more limiting
3. It requires a largely overstatted mod in order to improve your speed
4. Slower warframes mean that you will be left behind in larger missions because of the reliance on sprinting

Parkour 2.0 works fine in the few largely-vertical areas in the game. Anywhere else though and it's a downgrade.","1438387659"

I generally get so much attention from third-party recruiters that it's mostly noise. They're annoying, and a great source of stress, especially when the opportunities they throw me aren't my first choice.

I did end up accepting a job offer from a company that found me by my profile on Stack Overflow Careers. And one of my other really good offers found me by a technical blog post I had written. Both times were directly with the company, no recruiters involved.

It is also possible to modify the resolution to 1080p or even higher big editing the file and running the game in compatability mode for windows XP.

&gt; In 2007 the SAT was taken by 798,030 females but only 690,500 males, a gap of more than 100,000 people. Assuming that SAT takers represent the top portion of the performance distribution, this surplus of females taking the SAT means that the female group dips farther down into the performance distribution than does the male group. It is therefore not surprising that females, on average, score somewhat lower than males. The gender gap is likely in large part a sampling artifact.","1438387664"

Clips of everything would take forever, I agree.  If you're showing it, keep it a mystery until it's shown was all I was saying.  If you're looking for my advice on slimming down the next video, don't trim too much because it'll lose some of the charm.  My advice personally would be to do popular heroes who don't have complicated interactions with their skills.  It would be easier explaining how Phantom Assassin whole kit works than how just Shadow Demon's Disruption works for example.  

Then, the more episodes you do, the faster and easier the whole process becomes.  It'll be easier figuring out what you should show in a clip and what you can just show in a checkbox.  I'm sure your next episode wouldn't take you as long to make, after all you'll have some experience from making this one to help you out.

"vancouver","t5_2qhov","The spread is just the difference between bid and ask, and will vary between everywhere you look. Banks in Canada are part of a market oligopoly, and so by matching their competition, they are actually acting as a market buffer for the consumer end of things. They will typically post a ""spot price"" rate, which is actually a snapshot of a certain range and not necessarily accurate for the current forex market prices, it's like a nice average price. The spread for currency exchange will be slightly larger, like an extra couple pips (1 pip=$0.0001) on top of the current market spread. The spread is actually the fees everyone is paying, you pay the spread instead of having exchange fees tacked on to the transaction. It's a necessary evil in forex. If you're exchanging cash they will give you the spot price for that minute/hour/day, depending on how volatile it is (for CAD/USD it might be a moving average price, but as an example we saw the CAD/INR fall dramatically you might have noticed they locked in aggressive spread prices or even restrict trading altogether).



Besides this, regardless of intent if you are exchanging cash you won't find a ""favourable"" deal. You'll find everywhere is a similar average to the competitors, and currency booths typically won't offer a better rate than banks do, but you can always find exceptions to any rule. A brokerage account would be the best way to sidestep those spreads, and assuming you aren't gonna be needing that capital anytime soon, leaving the money in the account and waiting for the next rebound would offer even better returns than exchanging in cash and sitting and waiting.

As a result the state no longer has a ""republican form of government"" as guaranteed to all states under the Guarantee Clause (Article IV, section 4) of the US Constitution and the Colorado Statehood Act of 1876.  Furthermore, the Guarantee Clause is specifically required to be maintained in the Colorado State Constitution itself.

That's derived from the plaintiffs complaint, and IMO an excellent argument.  SCOTUS does not want to start mucking with reinterpreting the Guarantee clause.

The way you control taxation is by voting for your legislative representative, not by running an end-around with a ballot initiative.  That's similar to what happened when Colorado voters passed the discriminatory Amendment 2.","1438387667"

&gt; Additionally, one safari operator accused an American, by name, of killing a lion illegally and then smuggling its hide out through South Africa.  Given the rampant smuggling of other animal products across Zimbabwe's southern border (reftel), this is not unlikely.  As reported in reftel, American hunting dollars are vital to Zimbabwe's conservation efforts, but there are also serious risks that Americans could be implicated in smuggling and poaching operations. 
 
That was it. Somehow the ""journalists"" at RT have managed to spun a non-prescriptive, non-opinionated sentence of a US government memo describing claims of American poachers into this:

&gt; US government knew about and approved of its citizens going trophy hunting to South Africa

Final comment: RT is controlled &amp; owned by the Russian government. 100%. Completely. Its editorial direction is whatever serves the propaganda interests of the Kremlin. They've also been identified in several instances for using spam &amp; vote manipulation on reddit posts.

That's why Hitchcock was snubbed. The critics back in the 1940s, 50s, and 60s knew this and gave less than stellar review for his movies. And the industry hated him as well. Sure he did movies that kept studios afloat, but that doesn't mean he was accepted.

A Muslim man pointed this out on Tesco's twitter, saying he found the coincidence funny. Cue pages like Unilad, Lad Bible etc, and the Daily Mail/all manner of right-wing publications venting that ""Muslims even want us to get rid of bacon-flavoured Pringles now"", when of course no such incident had ever taken place.

"ADHD","t5_2qnwb","8 hours is a long time to study, don't get to hard on yourself :)

Have you considered shorter bursts for pomodoro? 25min then a 5 min break?

Can you switch between modules? I find long study stints are a touch easier if I'm swapping between topics (or tasks) often. Read for 25, write for 25, type up notes for 25, etc.

Text books are boooorrrrring. You need jelly babies. Place them across the page and you get to eat them as you read up to that jelly baby (replace jellybaby with delicious treat/cigarette/wine/etc).

Instead of 8 hour at once, what about 4 hours early morning followed by fun/Netflix/nap, then 4 hours later in the day?

People say don't study in your bedroom but if that works for you, screw em. 

Prepare your study session: it's worth taking 15min as you start to plan what your going to do. I plan 1/2 blocks with lots of different activities. If you get the hyperfocus, run with it! Just take a decent drink/food/bodily function break after.

It also has a long start up [edge has to run before he can slide] so if your out of range of his normals you hit jab and you'll hit edge out of both the slide or the overhead.

It's also not combo'able so if you watch it all the way until you block it then yes it's 0 on block but that's on you.

Dash cancelled judgement is safe.
It's invincible, 2-4 frame start up, can be combo'd into and when cancelled is + on block.

"linuxquestions","t5_2rbms","Found it.  My notes are actually only 6 lines, but I'll expand it out for you a bit:

1. Go to the TeamSpeak website [downloads page](http://www.teamspeak.com/?page=downloads) and download the appropriate package for your system.  For me, this was an x64 client.
2. Let's assume it downloads to the default ~/Downloads folder.  In a terminal, cd to this directory. Adjust accordingly if you've got a different downloads directory:
        
        cd ~/Downloads
3.  Issue the following command to give the file executable permissions:

        sudo chmod +x TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.16.run

4.  Execute the install script

        ./TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64-3.0.16.run (you can start typing Team and press [Tab] and it'll autocomplete the filename.

5.  Accept the license

6.  Navigate to the directory that Teamspeak extracts to.  In my tests, it just extracted into the Downloads folder with a folder name of TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64.

7.  cd to this folder

        cd ~/Downloads/TeamSpeak3-Client-linux_amd64

8.  Start the GUI

        ./ts3client_runscript.sh

Now you can easily bind a keyboard shortcut to start TeamSpeak, or issue the command through the terminal automatically on startup by editing your ~/.bashrc file.

This seems complicated because I had to add extra commands to explain the steps, but in actuality there's only 4 ""commands"" that are issued in the terminal, with 2 of those 4 commands being basic navigation (cd).

I hope this helps!","1438387672"

These are so named because one of them points north and the other points south, so they are actually a ""north-seeking"" and ""south-seeking"" pole.

If you took any magnet, such as a compass, to the north magnetic pole, the magnet should try to align such that the north-seeking pole will point straight down. Technically, this means that the pole in the northern hemisphere is actually magnetically ""south,"" because north poles of magnets are attracted to it.","1438387675"

also, How long will I need to wait for the cigar to dry before smoking it? I've seen people on YouTube leave their cigars for a week or 2 before smoking, I don't have a humidor as of yet, so I'm not even sure where I could store it in the meantime.

When this happens, you leave it blank until the other answers allow you to narrow it down. Sometimes you *think* there's only one answer, and then you realise it conflicts with another answer, so you erase as appropriate and search for a different pair of answers that are compatible.

We'd playfully fight over who would be who and get as far as we could before it was time to eat. Then we'd stumble back into the room, bellies full, and pick up the controllers until it was time for them to leave. It really was a tradition, just like when we would all play softball over Memorial Day cookout or make cookies for Christmas. Thanksgiving is one of my favorite holidays and playing Mario is so entwined with those memories that years later, when we were both grown and together for the holidays, we would talk about all those times we would play together and how we wished we still had the system. I really miss that. We're not so close anymore, both of us having different lives, but I always remember being kids and playing together :)

The problem is that all too often, some get extra greedy and collude with the politicians to gain a unfair advantage over competition. Much of this has been done under the name ""anti-trust"".

We could probably argue back and forth forever on the role of money in politics - remember, citizens united was in response to government trying to prevent the average citizen from organizing and buying ad time - so yes, from where I sit McCain/Feingold took the ""We the People"" out of the Bill of Rights, SCOTUS returned it with Citizens United.

In those dark, dangerous ages, *the 80's*, it was well known that diabetics had a much higher chance of being killed in a hospital. It's because there's a lot of different types of insulin. A short acting insulin needs to be taken with food, and a long acting insulin is given at night. Anyway, if you accidentally give a patient 60 units of Novolog at 9 pm, he gon' die. 

So the hospitals fired nurse after nurse before figuring out that perhaps packaging all the insulin in the same kind of bottle, with only 5 point font on the side differentiating between types, was a **systems problem.** 

It's easy to blame individual bishops, just like it was easy to blame individual nurses. But until the system is fixed, kids are just gonna keep getting hurt like a diabetic in a hospital circa 1982.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","My point is that there is a great deal more public outcry to bring this man to justice than there is to deal with many more serious issues. Most people are putting a lot more effort into protesting this man's actions than to combating the sex or drug trade, or other major issues. You say I'm trying to distract people from the issues, but I say it's petty bullshit like this that distracts people from the real problems in this world. 
He's a ""cold-blooded hunter"" because he paid money to go to Africa and hunt a dangerous animal? Maybe, but cold-blooded-ness takes on many more horrible forms, don't you think? There are others who do a lot more damage, aren't there? So why go after this guy, instead of those other ""cold-blooded"" people? I think there are a few answers to that question: 

1) Going after someone or something more important and more powerful would require a very special component: work. Basically, it's too hard. People would actually have to spend time and money to combat real atrocities, and why would they go to all that trouble when they can sit at home on their computer, or go to an afternoon protest and feel like they're doing just as much good? (Which, let's face it, they aren't) 

2) This pushes peoples' buttons. It's easy to rile people up about this sort of thing because they aren't desensitized to it. It's like when you watch a violent action movie without flinching, but when a dog dies on screen, that's the part that gets to you. This is what the media is doing with this lion. They call it by its name, and refer to it as one would a person. Please understand, I regret its loss too, but it is not a human being. They say it was innocent, and maybe that’s true, but no more so than many suffering people all over the planet.

3) People like to have the odds on their side. One man is seen as something people can succeed against; they can ""get"" him. But even though his crime may be relatively minor, and the impact of bringing him to justice insignificant, no one likes to fight the more important, more widespread battles, because then they won't get the instant gratification of seeing the fruits of their labor. It’s possible that even after devoting your time to solving a serious problem, that problem would still exist. You will have helped a great many people, but you may still not have won the war. People don't like that feeling, they don't like fighting battles they can't win, even when just fighting is enough to save people from a great deal of pain. So they stick to the battles they know they can win, and don't bother with the rest. Because tragically, a lot of people think it's about them, about sharing a page on Facebook so their friends can see what a great person they are. Unfortunately, most aren’t as concerned with alleviating suffering as they would have people think.

There is, in fact, a lot people can (but generally don't) do to combat some of the evil in the world. Compassion International, for instance, does some great work helping women who have been victimized by the sex trade. People could help them by donating, or by volunteering, but that would require effort and sacrifice. Problems are all around us. I guarantee your nearest large city contains someone in need of help, maybe they need a hot meal, maybe a place to sleep. Either way, I promise there is something you can do to help.
For example, this dentist, like me, is from Minnesota. Duluth is one of the largest hubs in the country for sex slavery. We know this, but I have never once seen a protest on the central hillside of Duluth to put a stop to it. Why? Well, I hope I'm wrong about this, but I believe it’s because people just learn to accept it. Yeah, we knit our brows and shake our heads sadly when the topic comes up, but deep down we feel it's just something that exists in this world. It's so widespread, how could we ever hope to stop it? So we huddle around our computer screens and lash out at easier targets: maybe a celebrity will make a racist comment, or a newscaster will say something insensitive, so we can spring into action, keyboards flashing, trying to be the loudest to cry for justice, when in reality, many of us wouldn’t lift a finger to help any real victims.
Forgive my heated words, my goal is not to offend anyone, but I find it profoundly upsetting the things people will ignore, and the hills they will die on. But I digress...
I most certainly did not imply that ""because supposedly few American are poachers that some justifies this American's actions."" I merely stated that there are others who do much worse, so basically, why don't we have bigger fish to fry? Also, is it somehow worse that he paid to kill one animal rather than getting paid to kill many? I think most likely not, but I’m not going to harp on it. Let’s let that statement speak for itself and move on.

There are two points you make with which I actually agree, and they are these: 
1) It is possible to devote attention to multiple important issues. Yes, it is, and my only question is, if so, why don't more people do so? They certainly don’t, but I think I addressed that fairly well above, so let's move on.
2) Yes, the world is imperfect, and yes, if everyone did their best, we could mitigate more than some of the harm in the world. To which I ask, why this guy? I'm not judge or jury, and neither are you, but is this really justice? To ruin the life of a man as payment for the life of an animal is madness. He does not deserve to be punished any more than he has been. I doubt if this man’s career will ever recover from this ruthless attack. Why do his actions warrant such scrutiny? People torture and kill other people every day and we gloss over it, but he did something distasteful to us, and he makes the news? At what point our priorities get so skewed?

My point to all this is that before we condemn this man’s motives or actions, we should examine our own. People are attacking this guy, but in the grand scope of things, how will it help? People are just being mean-spirited. Just because something seems disgusting to you that’s no reason to punish him for it. Let’s spend our energy doing some good, rather than seeking revenge simply because this particular case offends us personally.

"Patents","t5_2qiaa","First off, it makes things a lot easier when discussing patent law to use the term ""application"" or ""patent application"" when referring to an application and patent when referring to a patent. 

&gt;To submit for a patent (not provisional), can I just submit, or do I have to go through legal means to show that I've exhausted my search?

You are not required to submit any type of search when filing a patent application.  However, most jurisdictions around the world require you to disclose any prior art references that you are aware of.

&gt;If I file for a patent and the application gets rejected, can I just make changes and re-submit? If so, would it cost me an additional $1600?

Yes.  The changes are called amendments.  For the purpose of simplicity, every time you submit an application you get two rounds of examination, the first round with your original claims and a second round with amended claims.  However, you are free to resubmit, pretty much as many times as you like, and pay another large fee for two more rounds.

&gt;How long does it usually take to get a response on a provisional patent, or a patent itself?

Provisional application do not get examiner, they are merely placeholders.  Non-provisional applications in the US usually take between 1 and 3 years to receive a first office action.  

&gt;If I file a patent in the US, will it be protected internationally via the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT)? Or do I have to submit additional papers?

If you file an application in the US, you can file a PCT application and from the PCT submit related patent application in other countries.  If a patent is granted in the US it is not enforceable in any other country.

Max Theon was a Kabbalist and occultist  (hint at Tree of Life). 


Then you have Theon of Alexandria, known for his commentary on Euclidean geometry and original work relating to the astrolabe  (possible connection to Alpha Lupi, definitely something I should look into more). 


There is also Theon of Smyrna, whose works were strongly influenced by the Pythagorean  school of thought (!). Theon of Smyrna wrote *On Mathematics Useful for the Understanding of Plato* , which has a section called ""on the music of the cosmos"", which explains work of the time assigning specific pitches in the chromatic scale to each planet (could be connected to the tones of the oracles).


 Finally, there is Theon of Samos, a painter known for a painting of Orestes. (Orestes' father was Agamemnon, who wielded an aegis, not unlike Kabr himself or the player/guardian).

"RTLSDR","t5_2tr68","There are local and national pagers. It depends on what frequency you're listening to.

Local pagers, for example, may be used at a hospital. The transmitter would probably be on the hospital grounds. It is powerful enough so that the signal can penetrate to the deepest levels of the building. The signals can travel some considerable distance line of sight, especially if you're using a decent antenna (versus a tiny crappy one in a pager).

National pagers use a network of transmitters scattered around the country. They are usually extremely powerful. A given transmitter will cover a given area (typically whole cities or counties).

You will find both types in your locality, yes.

You'll be able to tell if you're picking up local or national, by looking at the messages.

These days, pagers in the UK are nearly all used for automated reporting of problems (such as rail related problems like signals not working, or servers/computers having issues), and medical stuff.

The only local pagers I know of in Hull are 459.325MHz and 161.0125MHz for 	Marks and Spencer's Voice Pager, and 454.200MHz for Hull Royal Infirmary.

Here is my list of national pagers:

There's a few nifty perks like trips for the interns to Queen's Park. The pay is low - you would get paid better anywhere else but if you're looking for the experience it does not matter. It can be a bit slow at times, after all it is the public sector and there is not as much of a ""rush"" that you would find in the private sector.

All in all it was a great experience and something that was quite valuable to my resume - but it just confirmed to me that a career in the public sector wasn't for me.

3d scanners are in a realm of maturity that needs... maturing for the consumer market at a reasonable price.

What a good open space 3d scanner needs is a very accurate gyro and accellerometer, two things Apple has been doing well for years.

You might want to look into 3d scanning techs like Lidar and others to see this is not a flash in the pan, and if they can just find the cash to develop it, there is nothing fanciful in their patent.

Once we get to FNAF2, though, the franchise definitely shows signs of having a more coherent storyline being developed.

What he described is a fairly mild form of railroading IMO. They did have some options at least (run, fight, submit). Still, it is bad form most of the time.

It sounded more like it was the player that decided his character should die than the GM. I don't think that player would be justified to be butt hurt about it.

&gt; On the other hand your players are reacting in an immature way. What's developing is a division of player vs GM.

The key to doing this is going to the websites for them. marcon.org, trotcon.org, ohayocon.org, matsuricon.org, origins.com, furlaxation.com, etc. there's plenty of conventions here in this city.

If you live in Dayton, you can also hit up the Cincinnati convention circuit since it's not too far away, I just don't know the name of any of them. I know they have their own ComicCon as well as a few others, but I'm not quite sure the names of them.","1438387699"

being the mindreader you were in the previous quote, it's surprising to me you suddenly swap sides of the fence with this quote:
""yet you pretend that Dubose didn't tell the officer twice that he did have his license on him""  here, all of a sudden, while I heard what the drive said, and could tell he didn't have a license (as he'd asked the cop to look him up on the computer) you suddenly believe the driver and ignore what I can clearly see--that he doesn't have a license on him.

If Jay Matthews wasn't constantly writing these articles on behalf of his friend, no one would know anything and Esquith's reputation wouldn't suffer the least bit of damage on a national scale. 

I'm not trying to say that districts should conduct investigations like this in secret, but I think it's important to take note of the fact that the district has done nothing to publicly tarnish Esquith's reputation. They have spread no rumors and gone to great lengths to prevent the public from prematurely jumping to conclusions. 

For everyone accusing the district of a witch hunt, I'm not sure what you'd prefer to see the district do differently. Someone obviously made a troubling allegation. I'd wager that Esquith's stature actually necessitated the scrutiny - imagine if the supposed allegation is true and word got out that the district didn't take the investigation seriously because the teacher in question was nationally recognized. 

If I were in Esquith's situation, I wouldn't want the district to tell anyone a damn thing until some conclusion had been reached. ","1438387699"

* Jack and Jill. Just... no. Adam pls. The Parent Trap, Nutty Professor, and other similar movies did the whole same-actor-different-people thing, and even then they weren't great. If you needed an excuse to put on make-up and put on women's clothes, just do it at home.

* Battleship. It took a lot of courage for someone to draft a script based on a board game, I'll give it that. But that entire process between script and movie should've stopped at a producer propelling the business end of a properly fitted steel toe boot into the groin of the maniac who drafted this idea into paper form in the first place. And the casting agent's groin too. Rhianna? And that sultry ""Boom"" during the trailer? The gods have forsaken us all.

* Jupiter Ascending. I had no idea what it was about, but that wasn't the issue. I think good trailers should reveal next to nothing about what's to come in the movie (see Interstellar, Inception, and then see Terminator: Genisys for how to do the trailers wrong, or any other movie that puts plot twists and the only good parts of the movie in it); I love sci-fi, but nothing about the trailer even tickled the slightest fancy of my inner nerddom.

"IronThronePowers","t5_361bq","""Perhaps,"" Viserys said. ""I cannot say. Sometimes I feel like I should."" 

The truth was, he wanted to find _her_. 

If it hadn't been for the fact that he had only one arm, he'd have supposed that she wasn't even real; a thing of his nightmares, nothing more. But he knew she was out there. The _Red Woman_. He could almost feel her walking the earth, and he saw her some nights. The ruby at her throat burned brightest in his dreams, brighter than his father's eyes and the flames that consumed the people he might call friends. Viserys wished the same thing he'd wished since he'd woken up in Maester Cressen's turret on his tenth birthday.

He would kill her. A sword, the hilt in his hand and the blade through her heart. He had been training for almost a year under Brynden Tully, and was much improved. He'd almost impressed even himself, but it wasn't enough.

And then in the dreams, he'd begun to fight. To kill. But never _her_. In his dreams, she was immortal, invulnerable. But in the world of the living and breathing... a woman that had no true strength. A woman that had to poison a child to get him to do as she wished. 

He would kill her.

None of this he expressed to Prince Lewyn. He simply glazed over, smiling slightly.

Beyonce can get away with drunk in love being written by 4-5 people because she sings perfectly in those kind of songs.

So if QM really is a ""two heads are better than one"" type of co-writer,it okay. If he's the one who gave Drake most of his hallmark flows and that if QM bounced, Drake's verse would be basic rhymes or out of flow. This would kill his career.","1438387703"

You can't pick up on sarcasm in a book, and without the context that /u/TheFifthTurtle provided (which is not available to an 18-year-old), it's the simple story of a heroic man who loses his family to the enemy and wants to defend his race from imminent destruction.

I suppose the movie, without context, is the same. But in /r/Movies, whose community has nothing but context for films, it is rightly viewed as a satire. It showcases ridiculous, WWII era propaganda, comical levels of gore perpetrated by aliens and not other humans, a rowdy sergeant with grit, a high school quarterback who dates the prom queen who turns down a cushy job in finance to join the MI, and even Neil Patrick Harris (DOOGY HOWSER playing an SS-esque doctor who can READ MINDS (""He's scared!

"Guildwars2","t5_2r9po","Give it to me because I am Veofratus, murder of hapless guardians.

One faithful day as I was running my daily quartz crystal farm path in Dry Top (one that involves going up towards the summit of Zephyr's Ascent, I discovered my horrible talent.


For my farming runs, I run a D/D zerker thief because of the unique stealth and agility expediting my runs - this means of course, I can two-shot most non-veteran PvE targets. A random guardian comrade was assisting me in clearing Dust Mites from the mountain top (partially farming them because they have a decent chance of farming charged lodestones). In our forty seconds of fighting side by side, we developed a camaraderie - even a brotherhood. Then, it happened.


The final dust mite to be slain. My guardian comrade leapt using Leap of Faith, and simultaneously I smited the dust mite with my one-shot combo. Mid-leap, my guardian friend lost his target - for I slew it before he could reach it, thus, he continued his leap...right off the cliff side, into his doom.


Since then, I have developed an insatiable bloodlust - a bloodlust to kill any dust mite on that fated ledge that a greatsword guardian may be targeting, for any semblance of a chance to hear the scream of another hapless victim. It consumes me everyday. Everyday, I lose more of my humanity. Soon, I shall ascend to the apex of my kind - soon I will not be a thief of petty ectoplasms or stunning maces, but a thief of waypoint costs.","1438387706"

That would flag the individual as a bad actor within our community. None of these things can really happen in a usable manner within a game, especially body language and communication with people who live in different time zones. Instead we have to accept a lesser mechanic and have the game communicate this to us. Also we have to accept that a more complex system would not be realistic with the available development team.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","The law has a pretty narrow definition of ""insane"" when it comes to an insanity defense. Basically, it only counts if you're mentally incapable of understanding your actions and their consequences. So while somebody like, say Anders Breivik, may have a list of mental issues a mile long, he doesn't get the benefit of an insanity defense (yeah, he's Norwegian and was tried under Norwegian law, not US law, but the point remains). Crazy though he may be, he was lucid enough to know exactly what he was doing. He knew that he was murdering people, even if he didn't think it was wrong. 

Now if somebody has a psychotic break and hallucinates that somebody is trying to kill him and he shoots them, he would have a strong chance at an insanity defense, because at the time he couldn't mentally understand that he was shooting an innocent person.","1438387711"

"40kLore","t5_2zdqr","I think it somewhat depends on the book your reading and the author that wrote it. Unfortunately It doesn't seem to be particularly consistent. 

Their height varies from around 7 to 8 foot, that's pretty consistent amongst most novels and other 40k books, most of the primarchs were much taller (apart from Alpharius). 

As for weight the Relic 'Space Marine' game puts them at around 300 kilos in armour but that would make their armour very lightweight (like 50kg lightweight which conflicts with other sources). The current 'worlds strongest man' competition winner is Brian Shaw at 6ft8in and 197kg. If we say a space marine is around that volume but taller we're looking at 210-250kg although it would definitely seem in the art that they are much bulkier than that.  I would imagine they would be of a slightly higher raw strength level without armour but with much more ability for stamina due to their enhancements. Then you add armour and the various servos and parts therein and you have a very very strong person indeed. Although I'm sure some others can provide more examples of them actually doing some stupidly impressive strength based things. 

They are superhuman but still very much in the realm of physical possibility, so they're not going to be lifting tanks over their heads and battling with them but at their weight they would easily outright snap the spine of a normal human with a strong tackle. When you factor in the weight of their armour... they're not exactly going to be beaten in fist fights by anything other than the stronger kinds of orks, (what they were initially designed to combat) orgryns, or other nasty xenos beasties.

Platinum 4

&gt;Who do you main?

Yorick and Shyvana

&gt;Why?

Yorick: Enemy can't counterplay at all. He has 1v2 and 1v3 potential. Everyone underestimates him. 6v5 teamfights.

Shyvana: Fast clear, strong sated devourer user because of W change.

&gt;How long did it take you to decide on that champ?

Both are simple and straightforward. I like these kinds of champions because I can focus on things other than aiming skillshots, like last-hitting, abusing CDs, item builds, etc.

&gt;How many games have you played on that champ?

Ranked isn't fun at all, so I haven't played it in a while. I've played Shyv since S3 and Yorick heavily in the last three months.","1438387715"

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","On your point about IT, I'll refer to Goku on that one. ""You de-materialize and travel as a mass of light. You'd be surprised how much ground you can cover going 186,000 miles per second."" So Instant Transmission, by its very nature, is traveling at the speed of light. 

&gt;And SPC is not roughly equal to SSJ2 Gohan. Gohan beat him with 50% of his strength. 

I pulled this from the wiki ""Also in his Super Perfect form, Cell seems to be comparable in strength to Super Saiyan 2 Teen Gohan""  Something else to note, Gohan may have been at roughly half strength, but the entire rest of the remaining Z fighters, to include a significantly improved Super Vegeta, were also throwing ki blasts at Cell. Had Vegeta not intervened, Cell would have won. You also have to understand Cell's personality a bit. Even at Imperfect he's arrogant and only grew more so each time he transformed. By the time he hit Super Perfect, he was even more arrogant than Frieza was in his final form. Cell was not taking Gohan seriously when he engaged in the Kamehameha fight.

&gt;And he can't exactly ""regen at any point"" as his regen is still ki based. If he runs out of ki, he can't regen. 

Are you basing this off of Piccolo's regen? If so then you can't really compare the two. For example, Piccolo stated multiple times over the course of both anime and Manga that he could not regenerate his head, whereas Cell demonstrates doing just that. Twice.

"battlezone","t5_2s8bv","Oh, I personally do care about VR quite a bit.
The first sentence wasn't sarcastic in that I love a good excuse for saving computations and making software run better on a broader range of machines by targeting an art-style that allows for a different ulterior argument for why it is more ""sparse"" than games that do so out of pure necessity.
I very much like this as a VR push. It is a smart choice. It works around a lot of the limitations of early VR (a tank game, so sitting instead of walking isn't a break, the graphic style working FOR it, old school appeal). I got a couple of classics in mind that would benefit from a similar treatment with similar pros.

Also an argument could be made that while VR being the smaller audience, the same could be said for highly complex shooter/rts hybrids.

Basically every one of those in the last 25 years was critically acclaimed, but didn't find a big audience. The ones that did well were those that were very light on the rts (like ""uprising"").
It sounds like a great combo, and I personally like them, but it seems that most players are more entrenched in their ways of playing, and find that the other part is just there to annoy them. (be it RTS or Shooter they prefer.)

They seem to me like the ""perfect"" MP game, since teaming up and splitting roles according to strengths and preferences seems like a thing that would work, but it rarely(never) turns out that way either.","1438387716"

A student at Central High School in Providence, Rhode Island, was suspended for smoking. The school had a no smoking policy.

But, he wasn't smoking. The principal was. He took a picture of her smoking and published it on his web log.

The ACLU got involved and the suspension was lifted but the principal only had to say she was sorry.

TL;DR Power hungry administrators will lie and cheat to keep their power.

"Velo","t5_2s4ji","A few things:

1. Power (and weight/aero) it what determines how fast you go, not HR.  This makes it easier to track your progress.  Over the course of my racing 'career' or whatever, my power/wt at LT went from ~3 to ~4 to ~5 watts per kilo.  LTHR did not change one way or the other.

2. HR will vary with weather, hydration, mood, nerves, caffienation, etc.  300W is 300W no matter how you feel that day.  I hear people all the time talk about how they ""couldn't get their heart rate up.""  Resting HR is a great way to test for sickness or overtraining, but on the bike, Power is going to be a lot more consistent.

3. HR isn't very useful for pacing shorter efforts.  Power is instantaneous.  HR has a ~1 min lag.

4. Speaking of pacing:  HR (or Power, depending on how you see it) will vary over the course of a given interval.  If you do a 20 min interval at a constant HR, you'll watch power drop over time.  If you do it with constant Power, you'll watch HR creep up.  I'm not saying one is better than the other (and honestly, I don't know if this happens to everyone, or just me), but it's worth considering.

5.  After riding with a PM for years and doing countless 3x10's and 2x20's, I got pretty good at pacing.  By now, I'm pretty good at knowing the difference between a 10-20-60min effort.  I don't think I would have gotten there without staring at a PM (during intervals) for years.

I don't know if there is actually a way to 'separate' the systems like I said currently, but something like assigning a certain set of blocks to be controlled by a specific control panel(s) only could be sweet.

Maybe have a function for the owner of the ship to be able to remotely unhack panels from any other panel in the system (""changing the encryption key"" or something), as a way to combat hostile hackers, and get them back out of the system. Of course you'd still have to actually find them and kill them in person though.

The resolution to your issue is that c^(2) is not a speed. c = 3\*10^(8) m/s, but when you square c you also square the units, so c^(2) = 9\*10^(16) m^(2)/s^(2). That's not a speed - I don't know what I'd call it. I actually don't even believe that quantity has unique or standard name, but I think that just goes to show that no one has really set a constraint on what that number can or cannot be.","1438387719"

My dad has one brother. Who is roughly the same age as him. They saved up a brought a Z80 computer which is really really old now but was pretty new then. They was boggled at the majesty of such a computer. Back then the negligible kilobytes of ram was seen as a blessing. So they thought. Hey, people like these things don't they? Lets open up a shop!

They saved up more money over a few years to rent out a little property. The were probably around 18 or something at this time. They went the scrapyards and salvaged huge CRT monitors and computer components. They learnt to build computers through hard slog and reading foreign and incompatible manuals they could find. Eventually they got them running with some really old OS that ran of f a floppy disk. 

Just as he predicted people went wow! when they could draw little things on the CRT monitor or write something so their business really kicked off! They eventually started to actually buy parts rather than find individual ones. 

They told me their reaction when 8mb's of ram was announced and how expensive it was back then. Also about how floppy disks basically dominated the market.

When I was born. At the age of 3-4 my dad would take me to the shop and I would just mess around with the various broken parts. Eventually I was allowed to take one home! It had no internet access, a huge block CRT monitor, ran at 640x480 resolution and was of course slow. But to me it was everything! My dad went on holiday and brought me back a disk called ""Top 50 blazing games"" which you can actually find on Amazon! This disk was amazing. it had all these little games and I must've spent over 30 hours on that one game. I used to stare at my dad's computer which had horrid dial up connection but we would wait for an image of a lion to slowly inch into the window.

If they're just reduced to their sex appeal to succeed in Hollywood, then yeah that's fucked, but if we're being honest, that's a standard they pretty much hold both sexes up to. Channing Tatum didn't get to where he got to based on his talent. It's just law of the land, you go to movies for the idealism and all, sexy people have the advantage on that front. Though yes, there are definitely more unattractive men succeeding in Hollywood than in comparison to unattractive women (am I allowed to say that?), but that really would be down to us the audience rather than Hollywood itself, they'll just go wherever the fuck the money goes.","1438387721"

These evaluations include both praise and criticism, for whatever virtues or flaws your speech happens to include, with specific directions and constructive advice. For the evaluations and brief unprepared speeches, to get detailed feedback you have to talk to people during the break or after the meeting - though we also vote for a best speech in the seperate prepared/unprepared/evaluation categories each meeting as well. Also, there are paper slips everyone is encouraged to fill out to give their opinions of each speech anonymously as well. Finally, you get some speech statistics at the end of the meeting for each speaker too (length of speech from the timer, use of 'ah' and 'um' etc from an 'Ah counter', and good/bad grammar use from the evening's grammarian)

The fact that I am being evaluated and criticised feels a lot less threatening when I am speaking, if I know that I am going to be greeted by applause even though I know intellectually it may be false applause, and the actual out-loud evaluation will be delayed until later on.

I am a firm believer in the Player's Choice Godfest. (PCGF) That is one of the very few times when your box has the potential to transform overnight. Many players save  their stones and just dump them all when the PCGF rolls around. Sadly, that is about five months away, most likely. However, a leader like DQXQ gives you the luxury of YOLO rolling here and there and being able to enjoy whatever it is you come across. 

All that said, I played Karin (another Chinese Elemental God) for a long time, and loved her. But I found her more difficult to play than Set, a leader very similar to DQXQ.

You will have to decide for yourself how big of a box you want, and whether keeping certain monsters around is right for you. He only real rule of thumb is don't get rid of REM exclusives because they are really tough to get back, and monsters get changed and buffed all the time. ","1438387723"

Pretty sure not much would change. The protoss would still try to aim for the perfect death ball, and the terran would still try to disrupt that. The thing is, it would be easier for the toss to defend now without taking losses, and there wouldn't suddenly be any more space for the terran to attack just because he doesn't need to macro at his base.

The game would need a complete redesign for this to be more exciting. You need more units that are actually strategic, that can control spaces or resources.

The website uses a totally retarded way to calculate what it deems as ""block propagation"" times. It sets t_zero = curTime when it sees a new block and then every other client checking in with the same block t_prop = curTime - t_zero. 

net-intel-api clients check in way slower (or are polled slower?) at stats.ethdev with new blocks than when they actually got the block from peers themselves.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Hey there, lending another voice to the other comments. I had a period of about half a year where I had vulvodynia, which sounds pretty similar to vaginimus, although perhaps less extreme. I was 21 at the time with a long-term boyfriend and I felt so betrayed and ashamed of my body when it happened. I couldn't do something that I loved and wanted to share with my SO. For a long time I didn't understand what was happening, and when I finally went to the doctor I kept wondering (and still do) why I had never heard of something like this before. It affects millions of women but is almost virtually taboo.

 My boyfriend and I basically didn't have sex for five months (there were other relationshippy things getting in the way as well) and he ended up cheating on me and I broke up with him.

I was able to heal and get much more comfortable with my body again by doing a combination of getting out of a bad relationship, taking certain doctor recommended vitamins, kegel exercises, and physical therapy. 

I still have some pain issues which my current SO knows about, and I am much more communicative to him about than I was to my last boyfriend. We take things slow and do a lot of foreplay, which I don't mind. ;)

Everyone has their own journey with their body, ESPECIALLY when you're a woman, and I hope you take the time to care for your physical and mental needs. Treat yo'self!","1438387728"

"ffxiv","t5_2rgs7","The thing is, DPS output is not a constant average stream. There's high output times and low output times.

Hax claim is that during those low output times where you have no direct damage oGCDs or ammo up, the 30% gain is less than the loss you suffer from not having autoattacks.

So the idea is to stancedance, so GB is up during high pot/GCD moments, and off during low pot/GCD moments. It's hard to do, and I also haven't been able to find real good info on the swap timings, but it definitely has the potential to increase the overall DPS output, and it likely also does so for BRD.

You can't really say that ""it's not worth it to toogle on/off"", since there's no payoff. It's simply a matter of stance dancing being harder than not stance dancing, but if you do it right, you gain DPS and mobility without losing anything.

Now the tricky part is that when you turn it on, it takes 15 secs before you can turn it off again. But my guess will be that the trick will be something with turning it on as gauss round gets ready, then fire gauss, keep barrel on for 20 secs and turn it off right after next gauss round.","1438387732"

And without NATO, you get a card come up on the screen that a lot more American troops are going to die in your planned operation. Going hard line just cost American lives (as it would in real life).

Hmm, that raises an interesting point. Would this help evaluate the candidates equally? Let's say Candidate A is successful in this case in getting Germany to support NATO's involvement. So Candidate A saves X American soldiers, which has to be an extremely fuzzy number.

That same simulation can't be used to evaluate Candidate B, who has to deal with a simulated military coup in a Tin Pot African Republic. The number of civilians saved could be larger in Candidate B's case, even while sacrificing significantly fewer soldiers than Candidate A's simulation. But the numbers don't tell the complete story, and since it's nowhere close to being a controlled sample I can't evaluate whether A is better than B or vice-versa....I don't know how anyone else could either.

And there still isn't a way to simulate the benefits of a long-term diplomat-type politician. Can't we have the simulations and then have a debate where they attack each other over their decisions. Instead of an either/or, let's have both. It'll make for better TV...

You get to hang out with other knife experts and see if they teach you something or just shoot the shit and talk knives. Many shops also offer repair, sharpening, cleaning, leather or kydex work. Again, all things you can get online but here you get to see it in person, talk about it in person, and have the best chance of getting what you're really looking for. If that isn't important to you, by all means shop online. I fully understand online shopping is a growing market and with most products I don't need to handle them first.

Even if you are ugly and out of shape, these practices can give you a chance.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Here's a thing, pathology is very very recent creation of science. The related topics to this free will, madness, normality and sexuality are very old and unresolved.

The classification of what is mentally ill and what is healthy is a big grey zone. If you are defining it as socially normal what else would we have to put in?

Is this a chase for the ""rational?""

How about atheists? In most communities in the world and history that is a sign of abnormality? Or maybe religious believers, those that believe in things that cannot be seen?

How about the pathologically selfish? Those on the psychopathic spectrum? Clearly abnormal and anti social. But how exactly to define that if they aren't breaking any laws. That gets complicated by those people being useful to society. Except if everyone was like that society wouldn't work.

Yeah its kind of tricky.

The soviet state made a very good habit of declaring political enemies of the state insane and locking them up. Are you sure you are not going in this direction?

"EngineeringStudents","t5_2sh0b","Maybe your company doesn't look at pedigree, but there are many who do and completely ignore anything outside that as far as NCG positions go. Many of these companies also say that they have trouble finding talent. I've seen it myself - I was fortunate enough to find a job but the place I got hired with said that they passed up candidates who I knew personally, and I could vouch for the fact that they were more intelligent and capable of the work than me, but were rejected for reasons like they didn't have the right cultural fit. That isn't right, and companies passing up people on these factors means that there really isn't the severe shortage that they claim there is.

If there are truly more jobs out there than engineers, there would simply not be such a large oversupply of new graduates unable to find work.

If this is the case, and they dont ask for the old tablets back (which... I think they will), there might be a possibility you could get the code from the old one, shut it down and reflash, use the code on the new one.

It would of course be a little bit scary, possibly leaving you with two unusable devices (new one locked waiting for code, old one bricked)....


I guess we'll have to wait and see, possibly its possible to deodex the code they ship or something.. I would assume smarter people than me are already looking at this :)

Majority of the Kurds clearly support PKK, which is clearly shown when HDP cant distance themselves from them. Kurds will achieve nothing if they dont come together and actually figure out what they want. PKK was their biggest leverage because they basically held the country hostage but its also their biggest roadblock because they keep giving government more excuses. There is nothing to be achieved by terrorizing the people you live with. If they had good intentions they would stand together behind HDP which would make them actually relevant.

I tried, gods know I did, so I feel I've earned the ability to say that I don't think I can be a part of it again.

But I don't rub it in, I don't scream it from the rooftops, I'm on no warpath. I get annoyed when the issues that drove me away come up but I bite my tongue now. I've never said anything that hasn't been said by feminists here on the subject of gender politics, I haven't lost any values I have as an undergrad a few years back.

But the fact that I won't use that label or maybe the fact that I used to but probably won't again just immediately merits a hateful pm or a downvote from some people.

Not every single organisation that receives funding from the EU is staffed by corrupt eurocrats who are interested solely in lining their own pockets. It's not nefarious for FotE to state that they think that staying in the EU would be better for tackling climate change than leaving it. It's not nefarious for them to not put a giant disclaimer on their statement of support detailing their affiliation because that information is easily available from them.

We war three times a week, which usually means fridays off (This is because we tend to start war at the same time, and after a few wars this start time becomes offset by all the war search time, up to a few hours). 

You need a password to join, and you can find it in the reddit clan system link on the sidebar of /r/clashofclans.

If you tried to define me as a squirrel, there would be no change in consequence, so your analogy is irrelevant.

I think that the confusion here is that you see a definition of marriage as something undefinable by the government: the union of two people to raise a child. Often, those two people will also merge their finances. That's where the government has to step in. They step in on financial grounds, not ethical ones. To step in, the government needs a definition for what constitutes the merging of finances. That is a definition of marriage the government has the authority to change. The finance-based definition and the child-based one have been conflated, so there are miles of legislation that need to be untwined before we can separate the two definitions.","1438387764"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Let me get this straight, just so I understand. 

Women are, as shown in other comments here *choosing* to name their children after themselves. 

They are *choosing* not to use the word 'junior' after the child's name. 

This free exercise in choice by women is somehow bad, simply because they aren't choosing the same thing men choose?

I mean, you understand that forcing them to choose the same thing as men is *actually* a patriarchy, right?

Like, you understand that saying ""choose whatever you want because you are free"" doesn't also come with a caveat that they aren't allowed to choose traditional gender/parenting roles and names?

By demanding that you need to see women do the same as men, you are, quite literally, suggesting that women shouldn't have a free choice. 

You are what is wrong with 3rd wave feminism. 

The movement has hit the point where it has started to deny the fact that women sometimes choose things that feminism doesn't want them to choose. 3rd wave feminism isn't fighting for true equality, it's fighting for 3rd wave feminism. 


Personally, I love equality. And for many reasons. But we aren't there yet, and ranting about how women ""can't name their child junior"" when there are girls and women forced into sexual slavery in some parts of this world, speaks fucking volumes about what you ACTUALLY are fighting for. 

Stand up for equality you wretched fuck, not some warped first world version of what feminism originally meant. ","1438387764"

"GodhoodWB","t5_38qfi","As far as I can tell.

I was transferring my install of Mass Effect off of my old computer onto an External Hard Drive. I thought you had to be logged into Origin to copy the files (you don't), so I logged in on that machine.

A few seconds later, I got a text message. I have most of my accounts setup to send me an text with a confirmation code whenever I log onto a new machine... and someone had just tried to log into Origin with my account.

I changed my password, but it wasn't until I had transferred Mass Effect onto my new computer that I remembered that some malware can copy itself onto drives that connect to it. I've been digging through recently added files and running scans just to make sure that nothing slipped in.

---

I suspect that the problem is that the other computer was using an old version of Origin, which probably had a security flaw that was exploited.

However, I treat any breach as being a total breach and am running scans.

So far, it looks like we'll be on time. I might be up late, and a bit drowsy when we play tomorrow. 

You mind keeping an eye out for me?

---

EDIT:

Okay, quick notice.

I think I'm okay... but my Origin account just gave me an indication that someone might have just tried to access it. I'm changing the password again, just in case.

---

Edit Again:

Okay, found the problem. I turn my computer's internet off when I leave the room, and I wasn't gone long enough last time for Origin to time out. As a result, I got a false-positive.

I am feeling sick though. I do this when I have computer security scares. There's a fair chance that I'm going to throw up a bit tonight, and it's going to be a bit of a restless night.

En A Coruña hubo otro inventor español que inventó el coche que se mueve con aire comprimido.

Este aire se puede generar con las mareas por ejemplo. Imagina un hotel para turistas o una zona recreativa o cualquier cosa en monton de plataformas en el mar unidas. Sube la marea y todo este peso se eleva sobre las columnas que cada plataforma lo ancla al suelo, o sea que se elevan sobre la columna. En el punto más alto de elevación se ancla y se espera a que baje la marea y luego se inicia la caida de todo ese peso que presionará un tanque de aire que irá comprimiendo el aire, o bien moverá un monton de motores para comprimir el aire. Este tremendo poder de las mareas no se está usando y puede dar toda la energía que necesitas.","1438387770"

"haskell","t5_2qh36","I'd say that checked exceptions are an exercise in futility, especially when it comes to pure code. Imagine this use case:

    at :: (Throws NegativeIndexException, Throws TooLargeIndexException) =&gt; [a] -&gt; Int -&gt; a

In most cases, the programmer will make sure that `at` only receives legal indices anyway, hence catching exceptions will not be necessary. The constraint, however, necessitates one of two solutions:

1. Write some probably non-sensical handler. In most cases, the function using `at` won't be able to do anything about the problem, nor will it be able to meaningfully report it to its caller.
2. Let it bubble up. Here, we have the opposite problem: the exception will be passed beyond whatever function had control over the index in the first place and go upward to God-knows-where. We thus end up with some main function that contains dozens of handlers that do nothing because they can do nothing.

In both cases, the alleged benefit of handling all corner cases is negated by the habit of writing empty handlers, which checked exceptions promote (see `catch (Exception e) { }` in Java). Then, one is better off making the handling of errors optional - then, at least one won't be lulled into a false sense of security.

A better solution would be to enforce that the originator of a value, or one of its sub-functions, be responsible for handling illegal values and even then, a warning would be preferable to an error. Checked exceptions are too weak to provide this, however.","1438387775"

In response to:

makes no sense. I was basically saying if you feel as though you are being excluded by 'Black Lives Matter' saying racist-implied remarks like:

&gt;Black people in the United States have never accomplished anything serious without Whites doing the lion's share of the work.

doesn't help your cause. 

And saying:

&gt;They are allowed to be as racist and discriminatory as they want, and that is fine.

which makes no sense either, must be because you feel a certain way about a race of people and want to justify your actions. Not sure. It's actually not healthy to be racist and discriminatory and it's truly not ok and in some instances against the law.

I like that Bernie is putting up such a vigorous campaign with such vigorous support. Even when/if he doesn't win, Hillary will certainly benefit from a tough primary season to make her sharper for the general election. But until we get to that point, there's nothing bad about having another candidate hold her feet to the fire.

The only Sanders fans who are ""delusional"" are the very few who are saying they will vote Republican if Clinton wins the nomination. You cannot credibly support a Democratic Socialist like Bernie and yet switch to the Republican when/if he loses the nomination.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","If you are asking about the United States, citizens can claim self-defense against officers.  The legal standard varies from state to state- are you interested in one in particular?

In some states there is an elevated standard if the assailant is an officer, requiring actual imminent danger rather than a reasonable fear or belief (the standard for self-defense). Here are a few examples I found in responding to a similar question:

*State v. Kraul*, 90 N.M. 314, 318 (N.M. Ct. App. 1977) (""The right of self-defense is not barred simply because the other person in the affray is a police officer."")

*State v. Hutchinson*, 959 P.2d 1061 (Wash. 1998) (self-defense instruction in case involving shooting of two police officers)

*Brown v. Commonwealth*, 497 S.E.2d 527, 530 (Vir. 1998) (""It has long been held in Virginia that where an officer attempts an unlawful arrest, the officer is an aggressor which gives the arrestee the right to use self-defense to resist so long as the force used is reasonable."")

*Boyd v. State*, 406 So. 2d 824 (Miss. 1981) (reversing conviction for assault on a police officer because the trial court failed to instruct the jury on self-defense)","1438387777"

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","&gt;You can see the link in 5.2 in OP. In that respect, for example even the law of identity requires SSC. Thus, if one universe is not the other, 5.2 applies.

That's really stupid, I'm not going to try to dignify this with a response. Again, this does nothing to demonstrate that causality (or even time itself) is meaningful in regards to universes, you're only saying that you personally find such an idea plausible. 

&gt;But one of the reasons is that if one attribute is different in one SSC than the other SSC, then there has to be a differentiating factor. Thus, none of these SSCs would not be SSC.

This only makes sense if you assume that only one SSC is possible, which is the very thing under discussion. Why can self-caused things not self-cause in different ways/locations? 

&gt;Can you substantiate your conclusion?

Relativity is a technical term with a specific meaning. It doesn't mean anything of what you said, open a first year physics textbook. Unity is a non-technical term. It cannot be used in a logical formalism without a logical definition, which you haven't provided. 

&gt;Correct. But some things are not demonstrated in collisions of particles. For example take the demonstrations in mathematics.

Huh? Math is conceptual. If the SCC is conceptual, then it doesn't exist except in that it can be represented in language and minds, which *are* 'collisions of particles.'  

&gt;If you read the properties of SSC, you will see that actually all collisions, sizes, dimensions are demonstrations of SSC.

That's a dumb circularity. You define the SSC as an original cause, then say that because there exist effects, the SSC must be real. But I reject that an original cause is a coherent idea, since the word 'cause' refers to the probabilistic nature of macroscopic objects. Just like causation fails in QM, unless you can observe causation as it applies to universes (and time itself), the map simply doesn't encompass the territory. ","1438387777"

"Dance","t5_2qhs0","Looks like I'm slightly late to the party. Here's what I think:

* Super Cr3w is ok, I liked the smooth solo in the beginning but otherwise they're more of the same. If they're going for stunts, they're competing with Quest on that front.

* IaMmE did great. I think unlike other known crews (Mos Wanted, anyone?) I get the feeling that they put more thought and effort into their performances. The triple stool kip ups were great. I think they'll appeal to both ""real"" dance fans and casual fans watching this show.

* Elektrolytes are ok. I liked them being the ""friendly underdogs"" who sent Mos Wanted home, but I don't see them winning this thing. Wasn't a fan of the song choice and their performance was alright I guess.

* I wanted Kinjaz to win, but unless they change something, I don't see it happening. I think they'll need more stunts to appeal to the general audience, because we see how far intricate choreo gets you - Kaba and SoReal both got far but didn't end up winning. I'm actually going to say Kinjaz are the biggest names outside of this show, as someone who watches YouTube vids and sees Kinjaz more often than any other crew on this show. Anyway, unless they appeal to the general audience, they'll end up like Mos Wanted - big names in the dance community who didn't change enough to win the show.

* Didn't watch season 4, never cared about We Are Heroes. They weren't bad this week, and I'll actually say they didn't deserve to be at the bottom, which would be Elektrolytes IMO. Regardless, I don't think they'll make it far.

* I agree that Quest didn't bring much new stuff to the table, but I actually think they may win the whole thing. I'm not sure if it's the production, but the crowd did seem to be the loudest for their performance. In the end, Quest is fun and flashy, even if there isn't much effort in their non-stunt choreography, and I think they're a favorite to win, especially if they come up with more crazy stuff like the sitting back flip and push flip.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate.

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations.

Some days are incredibly labor intensive and can have the potential for death or dismemberment from various things. Some days you're basically in a tractor the entire day just driving (which isn't half bad with GPS auto steering and a Bluetooth enabled radio installed ;) ).

Cologne 2014 was possibly one of the only times that C9 squad fared decent against EU on LAN. iBP eventually defeated the likes of ex-LDLC (Envy before -shox -smithz) a couple of times on LAN and did decent at events like FaceIT and ESWC","1438387788"

"videography","t5_2qwgz","- make sure you get a mixture of close-ups and wides (may sound obvious but still)

- before the shoot, write down a list of everything you'll need to capture. Works way better than trying to keep track in your head

- if you/the client both have time on the day, show them a few clips to give them an idea of what you're shooting, especially if you capture something you're particularly pleased with. Also ask them if there's anything else they'd like to get or if they have any ideas - psychologically this makes the client feel important and that they are contributing their own ideas

- movement - make sure some shots have some subtle movement, even the tiniest of moves to the left or right with your feet or hips can give a simple cinematic edge to a clip if done right (handheld or with a shoulder rig)

If Rogers sees a return on their investment this year (ie: better tv audience and attendance, jersey sales, playoff ticket sales etc), they will not hesitate to spend the money. I think it all depends on whether they perform, and if Price likes it here.

Recruiting for other schools is going to be hampered both by the fact that it's heavily saturated territory and that at best players are going to get two games anywhere close to home in their career. 

Their basketball program is nowhere near ready to compete in the Big XII.

Have you looked at the fantasy flight RPG rogue trader?  A key part of it is spaceship combat and it is a percentile based system, you can probably borrow a lot of ideas from that.

You're a cop hater who believes it's acceptable to lie to cops and speed away from them if you get your feelings hurt. You keep blaming the cop for stressing Dubose out but keep avoiding the fact that Dubose had a suspended license (which is a huge stress when you're being pulled over.)

So, your argument is this: Dubose got his feelings hurt by the cop and was thus justified in speeding away.

It is extremely comprehensive regarding these coils. To summarize it though, they look really well made. Thick damper rods, nice hardware, and quality anodizing. The main selling point for these are how low they go. They will literally set the subframe on the ground with 17's.  The reviewer says that the ride quality is not sacrificed for the low height. Smooth and comfortable according to him.

If Deathward did magical damage, 1.) it would be countered by BKB, and 2.) it would scale much better into the late game, and some combos would be ridiculously overpowered.

Riki is easy to counter - Zeus, Blyatcyka, and Sentries+Dust. He is a drain on supports, but he has to show himself at some point - a Riki with no farm is a useless Riki. Techies, on the other hand, never has to show himself, and can extend games irrationally long.

"DotA2","t5_2s580","He can dominate his lane because even though he is very squishy in the early game, spamming lightning just secures you farm and nuking the lane makes you able to rotate to jungle to take some camps while the creeps are coming. That's why winning a lane against him with a wrong hero is nigh impossible, as you will be down to no HP in no time. The Octarine is also a big factor in his power right now. You get to spam more lighning and more stuns, and it gives you lifesteal from your spells - which is very benefial considering that you are non stop dishing out the spell DMG. To counter him on lane (assuming it's mid) I would pick SF, TA or Huskar - SF can just stay back and raze, though that might be at times difficult, TA can shield herself from the lighning and harrass himquite a bit and Huskar doesn't really care about magic DMG a bit later on lane, and when he is vulnerable he can just harrass him out of the lane with spears. For other counters it would be BS (cuz you can stop him, and reduce his dmg output by preventing him from running into your team), AM (you know why), and pretty much everyone that comes online early to prevent him from getting big items and having your rax pushed by 20 min mark.

Day 6: Country Music. 

Well my parents listened to country music. They were right into line 
dancing. So I grew up listening to the likes of Johnny Cash. I Also loved 
the running bear song. But I have this particular fond memory of dancing in 
the living room at my dad's house in Rakia to the Song :
*Rose Garden by : Lyn Anderson* 
He had it on a LP an we would dance to it (waltz style). An I can still 
remember dad saying you'll need to know how to slow dance as you'll have to 
one day with a boy at dance or something like that. An me thinking at the 
time  no way... Kids huh..😊. This post really made me happy bringing back 
the good Ole days.


I didn't know much about Lyn till I read up on her when I chose this song. 
To me it was just a song I always heard but it sounds like she had some 
other big hits too.

They sound fantastic and are very comfortable.  They also look cool, are fully customizable and are probably some of the most durable headphones in the market.  They surprisingly have a fat but controlled bass without spilling too much into the low frequencies which would normally muddy up your sound.  They have prominent mids and great highs without being overly bright and tinny.  I would also suggest the Beyerdynamic DT770i or Custom i.  They are new iOS/Mobile specific Beyer headphones with lower impedance so they are louder with mobile devices.

if its a large vehicle, this is true, but if its my car, and I hit the brakes, it turns the nose of my car into a scoop and everything goes right into the windshield. More depends on the vehicle and animal size.   

&gt;but swerving is unsafe because you can end up losing control which is much more dangerous than hitting the animal

very true, and on top of that, if you end up in the ditch, but did not hit the animal, your insurance is less likely to cover you.  If you have the remains and pictures of what you hit, your insurance will list it under ""an act of god"" and cover you(if you have collision/comp coverage).  ","1438387804"

If you think on mega-apps that take million of dollars to build and are distributed to tens of millions of people, then yes. But if you are thinking on many utilities, then no, apps are currently the only model that at least somewhat works on Windows.

Most of the time people didn't like them because they had to work in the full screen, now there is no reasons why they won't become popular.

And saying this is like saying nobody uses computers. Apps have some function which is welcome for some people.

As GRRM has said few characters are inherently ""good"" or ""evil"" and this does a great job of balancing out the common perception of Littlefinger. This is why I always enjoyed the Varys vs. Petyr banter. So many of their goals and motives are so similar yet so different and I think that they both have good intentions. Varys has made it abundantly clear that he is a friend of the ""realm"" and the smallfolk. He tries to save what he can in the midst of chaos. Westeros is destroying itself and he wants to bring peace before it's too late. Littlefinger on the other hand believes the entire system is corrupt. Prior to TWOTFK, in Petyr's point of view, there was still injustice. Why should any man be regarded more or less than another simply based off of birth? Littlefinger wants to see the Seven Kingdoms implode, *I believe*, because he hopes that a newer, fairer system will rise from the ashes. 
With the current Westerosi feudal system, men like Petyr and Varys had to do unspeakable things to rise into a place of power where their opinions actually mattered. The difference between Petyr and Varys is that while one is content with the status quo, the other wants to see it shattered. This is why I will always be a Littlefinger fan.","1438387808"

"CanadaPolitics","t5_2s4gt","I agree fully. I think Mulcair and the NDP have mishandled the debate issue at every step. By agreeing to Harper's position on the debates, Mulcair effectively endorsed that stance and gave it legitimacy. Had he said no, he would have been able to paint the PM as being shady and controlling in trying to break from tradition. 

Harper has demonstrated that he is an amazing planner and strategist. Watching Mulcair play into Harper's plans leaves me with doubts about Mr. Mulcair. 

I won't vote CPC as I am not well aligned with their positions. I think Mr. Mulcair has not been handling the debate issue well at all and I am starting to think many of their positions are designed to grab votes rather than comply with their principles.  I think Mr. Trudeau is mis-managing his campaign which leaves me less than thrilled about him as PM. And, to be honest, Ms. May's position on WiFi makes me thinks she is a fucking nut.

Petyr was corrupted by the same cruel exploitative system that he sought to destroy. He's playing its game in a bid to tear it apart from the inside out. He may have started out as the man from OP's description and turned into the man you describe. The system hungers for souls and it sucks people in and gnashes them to bits and spits them out. Petyr Baelish is in the belly of the feudalistic beast, trying to rip out its heart but in his quest he has become the very vision of the violent lords he despises, treating people like collateral the same way all the others do.

"Gundam","t5_2sjr4","I would either start with Gundam 00 or the original series (the full series, not the compilation movies IMO. same for Zeta). 00 is really accessible, looks great, and has a pretty alright cast/plot. but I think you'll appreciate every other entry in the series a lot more if you watch at least Gundam 0079 and Zeta. the animation is dated but I think it still looks pretty good and the characters and stories are all pretty engaging. as for series not to watch, most people will tell you to steer clear of SEED Destiny and AGE. I... agree mostly. the original SEED is alright and maybe also a good starting point but Destiny is kind of polarizing.

apart from that, any of the UC OVAs are great, especially 0080. I think all of those except 0083 and Unicorn you should be able to watch without a lot of prior knowledge. F91 might also be a good spot to start but it can be a bit confusing if you're not accustomed to the back story of the major UC arcs.","1438387810"

Bottom line, and beyond your stupid analogy, Idol 3 vs Nexus 5 is actually a very good comparison. Idol has better battery life, screen, speakers. Plus Micro SD. Nexus has better CPU, maybe camera (not sure there) and udpdates.

"WildStar","t5_2sqwc","Daily login rewards are a simple incentive to get people looking at your game. On the player side there is little upfront commitment of time ""I will just long on for 10min to grab the reward"" (2hrs later and x$ later). From the business view, the more time you are looking at the game, playing the game the more likely you are to spend. The added benefits to a visible population go a long way as well. If people see people, they go ""hey I wonder what they are doing, It might be good and I might miss out if I don't look too"".

It should be no surprise that this will be included in a more AD based aggressive marketed game. Balanced right it is a win win, however it does have risks of burn out inducement too. If a player only logs on to grab quick reward due to (example: too good a reward) then the feed back loop gets broken the the player finding it easier to log in for 10min rather then 2hours to get a better reward.

All for simple incentive to log in. Against sugar coated 'good' rewards for simply logging in.","1438387814"

"Drugs","t5_2qh7l","I would like to think I came out OK, but defiantly recognized effects years down the road. Many of them I have over come now and do not typically attribute my abuse to problems I have today. For many years after I was depressed sporadically for no reason at all. I was moody and had drastic swings in my personality. I had difficulty concentrating a lot. Most of all I had regular occurrences of what I started calling ""glitches"" where I would be mid sentence explaining something I was very familiar with or trying to recall intimate details of something I knew I remembered, but suddenly would loose all train of thought and not be able to form my thoughts into words or even internally remember what I was even conceptualizing. Research at the time pointed toward dead spots in the brain due to MDMA abuse and I came to the conclusion that it was my brain hitting one of those inactive regions and having to reroute around it,  momentarily causing me to loose my grasp on my thoughts. I also had a lot of problems with experiencing joy. Things that normally would inspire others fell flat on me. I knew it was important and sometimes globally important but it just flew right over my emotional response capabilities. (9/11, death in the family, dramatic and life changing legal issues, murder of a friend...I was just responsive toward any of it)

My abuse went far beyond recreational use into the realm of fiction/gonzo journalism type shit. MDMA was the least of my concerns at the time though with what I know now I regret not taking it more seriously. If I had to estimate I took well over 2000 pills in a 5 year time frame. ","1438387814"

"asoiaf","t5_2r2o9","I'm convinced that the ice cells in the wall are a way of foreshadowing that the wall isn't even a wall, but a prison for dragons entombed in the ice. It's why Mel is so strong at the wall. 

I also think the Night's Watch has literally been defending the wrong side. They are supposed to keep humans from going north of it so the Others can't raise an army. 

And the wall itself represents the stalemate at the end of the long night. Others and dragons entombed together to make all the power of fire and all the power of ice cancel themselves out in perpetuity. If the Others stopped using their magic to keep the wall solid, the dragons would instantly vaporize them. If the dragons stop generating heat the wall would crush them. It's meant to keep ice and fire locked thereby keeping the realm safe for man.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","From Wikipedia... Notice the use of ""bad faith"" in the wording when referring to ""making profit"". 

&gt;Cybersquatting (also known as domain squatting), according to the United States federal law known as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, is registering, trafficking in, or using an Internet domain name with bad faith intent to profit from the goodwill of a trademark belonging to someone else. The cybersquatter then offers to sell the domain to the person or company who owns a trademark contained within the name at an inflated price.

In the US
&gt;Some countries have specific laws against cybersquatting beyond the normal rules of trademark law. The United States, for example, has the U.S. Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act (ACPA) of 1999. This expansion of the Lanham (Trademark) Act (15 U.S.C.) is intended to provide protection against cybersquatting for individuals as well as owners of distinctive trademarked names. 

International 
&gt;Since 1999, the United Nations copyright agency, World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), has provided an arbitration system wherein a trademark holder can attempt to claim a squatted site. 

Of course if you google you'll see large number of lawsuits where people bought domains to make profit but then they lost it for the corporate that sued them. ","1438387815"

""what they think the viewers will be interested in"" so before the viewer can do anything it's your turn to select the stories and yet it's all his fault. and it's a guessing game.. with numbers of the past telling you that crap is more successful? but when important things happen and noone cares then wasn't it you who failed to properly communicate the importance?

"technology","t5_2qh16","I dont think self driving cars are a good idea in the way reddit talks about them. I need to be given manual control back in my can instantly without question. I dont need some program dictating when I can drive my vehicle. If Im drunk, them Im drunk, I accept the consequences. 

Also,Yes computers have excellent reaction time and can monitor many variables at once. But reaction time is not everything. The problem lies in the unpredictability of driving. Even a computer will not be ready for it. And most of all, it wont be ready for the decision making that goes into driving. What is the primary directive of the self driving car? Is it to avoid accidents at all costs? Is it to obey traffic laws at all costs? Is it to ensure safety at all costs? Those things cannot happen simultaneously at all times. So the computer will have to prioritize.

So for example to avoid an accident you may have to break a traffic law right? But how far are we willing to let self driving cars go? Take this scenario: You driving along in your self driving car and someone runs into the street without looking. Regardless of reaction time, cars cannot stop on a dime. Its going to hit that person. So will it hit the brakes and hit that person at a slower speed or swerve out of the way? What if it swerve out of the way, hits a ditch and your car flips over an rolls down an embankment? So you probably want safety to be first. But for who? Does the car protect the driver, its owner, at all costs? Or will it sacrifice your safety for the 'greater good'?

Is the safety of me and my passengers always the top priority of this computer? Or will it sacrifice my safety to save a bus load of kids? But what if I dont want my (the driver's) safety to be top priority? My wife and kids are in the car. If the car has a split second to swerve to make the impact less severe, who will it be less severe for? Will it protect the driver at all costs?

Given the right set of circumstances, will this machine make the conscious decision to endanger the life of my passenger in order to save me?

The completely autonomous vehicle that reddit seems to think is coming down the pipeline is nothing more than a pipe dream at this point.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","&gt;Boredom is the default mood. Mere existence isn't enough to satisfy us, we constantly have to distract ourselves from boredom

Boredom is one attitude to take towards how we respond to a lack of stimulation. Another tack is ""curiosity"". Any time I feel bored, I know it's time to study something, read something, or do something productive.

&gt;Pleasure requires effort, suffering does not. I literally don't have to do anything to suffer from boredom and starvation

Why does something requiring effort make it bad?

&gt;Suffering is more powerful feeling than pleasure. Is there an opposite to a cluster headache?

Possibly. I haven't tried it, but I imagine certain controlled substances provide such an opposite.

&gt;The universe doesn't care about how we feel. No one is protecting us. If I'm falling onto spikes, universe is not gonna pull me away and protect me, no matter how hard I pray.

Barry Godber (1946–1970), a computer programmer, painted the album cover. Godber died in February 1970 of a heart attack, shortly after the album's release. It was his only album cover, and is now owned by Robert Fripp. Fripp had said about Godber:

    Peter brought this painting in and the band loved it. I recently recovered the original from [managing label E.G. Records's] offices because they kept it exposed to bright light, at the risk of ruining it, so I ended up removing it.

"Animesuggest","t5_2ssl0","A list of what you've seen would be quite useful, but...okay.

(2003) Full Metal Alchemist, it has ""shounen"" comedy involved but less, also a darker atmosphere, less meaningless, over-the-top fighting scenes and a less distinguishable black-and-white world. People usually recommend watching Brotherhood, well, I recommend watching this instead, as I find it better. 

[Mononoke](http://myanimelist.net/anime/2246/Mononoke) Is an...""episodic"" (3, 2, 2, 3 eps/story) anime, it is...dark, but mostly if you think about it, the art and execution is unique, there's quite a lot of dialogue also. Never fast paced, as far as I remember.

[Mushishi](http://myanimelist.net/anime/457/Mushishi) isn't necessarily dark, but atmospheric, episodic. Fits your bill, more or less -I don't remember fast pace here either, nor a complex plot.
You could give it a try nonetheless.

There is **Ghost in The Shell** (Edit: It's dark sometimes, plot is more complex, characters are mature, believable even, but mostly one dimensional, for reasons you'll notice yourself while watching it. Sometimes gory, but not unnecessarily, and you'll have a lot of dialogues also.) I'd suggest watching in this order:

[Ghost in The Shell](http://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Ghost_in_the_Shell) (movie, two versions exist, the newer is filled with CGI, IMO 1995 version's better, set in 2029.)

[Ghost in The Shell: Stand Alone Complex](http://myanimelist.net/anime/467/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex) (the series, set in 2030),

[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG](http://myanimelist.net/anime/801/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_2nd_GIG) (2nd season, telling another tale, set in 2032),

[Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence](http://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2:_Innocence) (sequel to the 1995 movie, set in 2032)

[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex - Solid State Society](http://myanimelist.net/anime/1566/Ghost_in_the_Shell:_Stand_Alone_Complex_-_Solid_State_Society) (set two years after the events of 2nd GIG: 2034),

and finally the [Ghost in the Shell: ARISE OVAs](http://myanimelist.net/anime.php?q=ghost+in+the+shell+arise+border&amp;type=0&amp;score=0&amp;status=0&amp;tag=&amp;p=0&amp;r=0&amp;sm=0&amp;sd=0&amp;sy=0&amp;em=0&amp;ed=0&amp;ey=0&amp;c[]=a&amp;c[]=b&amp;c[]=c&amp;gx=0) (set before the first movie, a prequel on Section 9).

[Rainbow](http://myanimelist.net/anime/6114/Rainbow:_Nisha_Rokubou_no_Shichinin) something dark for you. My No.1 mood buster.

[Steins;Gate](http://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins;Gate) has dialogues, lots of it. Isn't dark but intriguing (opinional), characters are a bit weird, plot is not really complex yet for the characters it's quite a headache.

[The Sky Crawlers](http://myanimelist.net/anime/3089/The_Sky_Crawlers), a movie, atmospheric but in my opinion, dark. Story isn't complex, and I do not wish to spoil it the slightest.

With all these suggestions I tried my best to avoid all what you hate while suggesting (in my opinion) good shows.","1438387823"

"windows","t5_2qh3k","A Reuters report earlier this week clearly stated that Microsoft planned to tackle software piracy, especially in China, with a “free upgrade to Windows 10.” But that is incorrect: Instead, Microsoft will continue to treat stolen Windows versions as it always has, and it is not giving amnesty to pirates.

The confusion is understandable, given the headline to the Reuters report: Microsoft tackles China piracy with free upgrade to Windows 10. But the article itself quotes Microsoft executive vice president Terry Myerson, who is leading the effort to develop Windows 10.

“We are upgrading all qualified PCs, genuine and non-genuine, to Windows 10,” Myerson told Reuters in a telephone interview. The plan, Reuters said, was to “re-engage” with the hundreds of millions of users of Windows in China, though there was no “elaboration.”

That may very well be because Microsoft’s stance on pirated Windows copies has not changed at all. And in the wake of numerous inaccurate reports—”free upgrades even for pirated copies” and even I mentioned it myself in Boldly, Microsoft Claims It Will Ship Windows 10 This Summer—Microsoft has decided to set the record straight.

“We have always been committed to ensuring that customers have the best Windows experience possible,” a Microsoft statement notes. “With Windows 10, although non-Genuine PCs may be able to upgrade to Windows 10, the upgrade will not change the genuine state of the license. Non-Genuine Windows is not published by Microsoft. It is not properly licensed, or supported by Microsoft or a trusted partner. If a device was considered non-genuine or mis-licensed prior to the upgrade, that device will continue to be considered non-genuine or mis-licensed after the upgrade.”

"MysteryDungeon","t5_2srkz","Smoochum's really good for Zero Isle South because it gets a room-hitter at lv. 11 and a confusion-move at lv. 8. With these kinds of dungeons, you're usually not fighting much after floor 20, and it's mostly about getting to the stairs as quickly as possible (at least, that's how it went for me). Smoochum's room-hitter (with a chance for freeze!) and confusion move help you get away from trouble. It also can evade moves like crazy with Forewarn, helping you get out of close scrapes.

Levelling rate is also a big factor in what makes challenge-dungeon explorers good. If they level slowly, they'll be struggling to get to level 5 by the 20th floor unless you sit there and hoard Apples and beat down every Pokemon you come across.

So, after looking at all of that info, you'd ask, ""What on earth would make me want to use Alakazam?"" Alakazam is a really good Pokemon for just speeding through Purity Forest (not so sure about Zero Isle). It has Teleport as a starting move, so you can get to around level 5 and then just warp away from any trouble. Curiously, its defenses also seem to be literally broken in Purity Forest; you'll be taking 1 HP of damage from enemies 25 levels above you. Alakazam's strategy relies on loads of Max Elixirs and a lot of luck, though.

I don't have much to say on Drifblim since I haven't tested it yet, but it starts off with 2 STAB moves and Minimize. Minimize seems to be the move you're going to be spamming the most, giving you loads of evasion so that you can just breeze past enemies. 

Really, though, there's a lot of Pokemon that could probably work decently in these challenge dungeons, although I haven't tested these yet. What you need is evasion, high defenses, decent starting moves, and fast levelling. And luck. And patience. Lots, lots, and lots of luck and patience.","1438387829"

That said, out of the recently released dungeons in NA, I think she'd only really have a hard time with Sphinx (due to the &gt;200k damage absorb).  Diagoldos halves dark, but your attack should be high enough to punch through anyway.  Sonia Gran is similar, but you get extra turns.  Aamir is pretty straightforward, and although he also has a high damage shield, it's coupled with a full heal anyway, plus it only lasts two turns, so it's relatively easy to stall out while you're getting back into your HP sweet spot.

The biggest reason she's becoming unpopular is that 4x isn't very strong anymore, and heart skyfalls can completely ruin your run, depending on your team and the dungeon.","1438387830"

"AskRedditAfterDark","t5_2vh2s","I think the whole movement was in a large part in response to the insanely (as in, unhealthy) skinny movement that was happening with models, actresses, etc. in the 90s and early 00s (not that it wasn't present before, but from my memory as a child, it seemed to be everywhere). Obviously there are still unrealistic standards and ideals all over our society when it comes to body image, but the whole ""love your curves"" mentality I feel has reversed at least some of the damage done to women who grew up in the time frame that I mentioned who DO have normal, healthy bodies that simply DON'T and often CAN'T uphold the standards that society expects them to be at. That doesn't mean that there aren't some unhealthily overweight people who use this relatively new movement of acceptance to justify their unhealthy habits and body type, but I'd say that the majority of the impact of this movement has been positive, particularly on the youth that are starting to grow up and mature now. 

That said, people should just worry about themselves and decide if they are satisfied with their bodies by the standards that they choose (as long as they are attainable in a healthy way) and not worry so much about how others perceive them. Hell, confidence in oneself and not giving a fuck about the opinions of others can be one hell of a way to make someone with a conventionally unattractive body into someone that many would consider attractive.","1438387834"

kRYSTAL used to cheat in the early times of CSS, there was alot of obvious footage against him and he admited cheating (I think he was 15 or 16, and I think everybody once tried a hack when he was young). He got 12 penalty points in ESL which means 2 years ban. Afterwards he started again playing and ended up being one of the top 5 players in CSS.

The best two teams where Alternate attax and Verygames (Verygames a bit better). kRYSTAL played years for Alternate attax including a lot of LANs and online Tournaments with cheat protections like Aequitas and ESL Wire. There is no way he is still cheating, he was very young when he cheated and if you actually follow his vlog a bit you will notice he is one of the most honest and humbles people on this fuckin planet. Do you really think Penta would still strugle to get far in a big major if he would be hacking.

If krystal should ever get caught cheating I will giveaway my whole inventory on reddit.

This whole video is nonsense, maybe he just wanted to aim at the border of the smoke so he moved his crosshair and while he did that there was a player right behind the smoke, he even missed the shot. I really dont get whats the point here, I did a lot more strange stuff and never got Overwatch (no I dont cheat).

kRYSTAL did cheat = yes
will he ever cheat again = never ever

It was after all the British version of the IMF but completely off the record and something that could never be tracked to them, but instead the PM didn't go along with it. So it was hypothetical on paper, he had fully developed the plan and laid all the ground work, it only needed the PM to agree. The only issue is why they would store the funds in a SCIF.  If the PM was to have direct control of the funds then it would make sense to be kept somewhere close, but I guess it does make to sense to store it somewhere that secure even with the added security because the guy who hid it was killed when Solomon Lane went active with the plan.

I'm not sure this is the best approach. You will be banning people for breaking something which isn't a rule anywhere except on this post.

If it was implemented directly in the game with a warning, confirmation dialog, or anything else which made it exceptionally clear the purpose of the mod call you would get less abuse and you wouldn't have to ban players who didn't know what they were doing.

Add to this that players will see the fact that you are doing a !mods call and stop what they are doing, and I really think your current approach adds quite a bit of moderation tasks for you with very little benefit.

The 13th Black Crusade begins in 795.999 M41 with some Nurgle space hulks crashing into worlds around the [Gate.](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/warhammer40k/images/3/32/Eye_of_Terror_Campaign_Map.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120920044300) [Map of the galaxy for scale](https://unequivocalhorizon.files.wordpress.com/2011/01/liberastartesstarmapver2.png). The hulk problems are largely dealt with, or given up by around 975.999 M41 Where the real invasion begins. This is the point where Creed takes over and realizes the threat for what it truly is. The astropaths burn themselves out sending the signal to all Imperial worlds and guardian fleets are mustered as quickly as they can. As of 995.999 M41 there are multiple fleets working tirelessly to keep Chaos from overrunning Cadia. 

There are a few fleets that are tasked with guarding the eye at all times, but there's one currently involved that isn't. Battlefleet Solar sent a detachment to help defend the gate. That's the one that I'm getting the speed from. 

That fleet went from the docks of Terra to guarding the space around the Cadian gate in less than a few weeks. A few days if you want to think they responded only once they heard the choirs of Cadia blasting out their message. 

Imperial ships are not that slow to cross the galaxy when they need to. Straight shot from one end of the galaxy to the other would take a few months at worst. ","1438387840"

Olympics are given to host cities for two reasons 1. sheer economic ability to host an Olympics (London, Sydney, etc.) and 2. a city/country showing signs of development, where an Olympics would benefit the region with added economic activity and the rest of the world as a showpiece of developing prosperity and regional diversity (Beijing, Rio, etc.).

&gt; Agree, although I actually enjoyed the show. The difference is I heard so much shit about the Deen adaptation that even though I liked Fate/zero it sufficiently lowered my expectations for the entire franchise. Went into UBW expecting a shit show about a dumb ass and his dumb ass tsundere gf and got an average show with very good animation. I do think that Emiya's character arc could be interesting if it makes him question what he's going to have to do to be a ""hero of justice"" and what being a hero means, but I'm anticipating about 5 minutes of contemplation mid fight while his enemy stands there watching him until he gets his power up and wins the fight.

[I'm so happy](/s ""that I was wrong. I think they dragged out the conflict between Shirou and Archer"") a bit more than they needed to, but the overall arc of the show was exactly what I had hoped for, and a  [good](/s ""de-, then reconstruction, of what it means to be a hero."")","1438387844"

&gt;You are being dishonest.

You are completely ignorant of the world and how it works, I am not being dishonest, you are unaware of the dangers of intellectual property and how its being used to compromise peoples privacy, rights and freedom.

One major problem  (of the many problems with ""IP"") comes when companies put backdoors into software products and are now shielded by intellectual property law.  AKA my privacy is violated by forced drm (always online software).  That are now compromised by purposeful bugs/defects so the NSA's of the world can see everything at a whim.

""Nicola Hahn writes:
The topic of key escrow encryption has once again taken center stage as former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff has spoken out against key escrow both at this year's Aspen Security Forum and in an op-ed published recently by the Washington Post. However, the debate over cryptographic back doors has a glaring blind spot. As the trove of leaks from Hacking Team highlights, most back doors are implemented using zero-day exploits. Keep in mind that the Snowden documents reveal cooperation across the tech industry, on behalf of the NSA, to make products that were ""exploitable."" Hence, there are people who suggest the whole discussion over key escrow includes an element of theater. Is it, among other things, a public relations gambit, in the wake of the PRISM scandal, intended to cast Silicon Valley companies as defenders of privacy?""

Harper's strength lies in that his government is painfully short on details beyond prepared hot-button points for this demographic and that neither he, nor his ministers, assume any responsibility for anything if they even bother to speak publicly.  It's a very tightly controlled, very choreographed approach to PR and both self-medicated housewives and tough-as-nails Manly Men love it because it basically does away with the annoyance of thinking. 
It's a great system, and it's apparently working.  

Reality TV is insanely popular for this same reason.  You don't have to suspend disbelief, you just have to ignore anything that breaks the illusion as long as someone tells you to.  There's a fine difference there, but there's a difference.

According to this statement, she did not even know it was Adnan's car Jay had on January 13th until February 26th, night before this interview.

&gt;He continued, noting that Garen's Silence would not be removed:

&gt;  i dont think theyll touch that part. they only removed the silence on champions where it was more or less inavoidable. you couldnt avoid kass from blinking in, and hitting you with it, then retreat before it runs out. same for leblanc. 

&gt;this created a lane pattern where theyd poke you down without giving you the ability to do anything against it. 

&gt;removing the one off talon is debatable, but a similar problem. you couldnt do much against him hovering with the cusor over you and hitting e from a distance. and then he could unleash his chain on you while youre disabled.
&gt;with garen, its as simple as to just not let him come close while his sword glows.

&gt;&gt;That's pretty accurate as to our thinking on silences (can be a good fit on champs where there are things you can do to avoid the silence, generally not appropriate on characters who have the tools to silence you with really high reliability). Garen's keeping his silence as a result, for while it's click to hit it's also a melee ability and he doesn't have a dash/jump/blink.""

"movies","t5_2qh3s","If Roxy was the one that offered anal sex, that would have been awful, for instance.

Here, he saves the day, he's the hero, the knight who saves the princess (this is an actual princess, which makes it more explicit they're kidding), like in a fairy tale.

In my opinion, it makes fun of how normal this in some movies and in 'classic' story telling, for the hero to get the girl. Here she wasn't anyone to him but this is part of why some can find it funny.

The way this is very straight to the point and uncalled for is what is funny.
I would agree that the way it comes out of nowhere doesn't fit in the movie where feminine characters are not really sexualized (except for Eggsy's mother and a tap on the behind that sam l jackson gives to his henchwoman, but to me their behaviour together seemed to show they might have been in a relationship).

To be honest, what took me aback from this scene was how I somehow expected our hero to end up with Roxy, even though they simply were friends, and nothing more, just because I'm so used to the way movies always end. I liked how it caught me off-guard.","1438387856"

Your lyricism is on point though! I think something that could help would be to try and experiment with that off flow pattern. Add some sixteenths, maybe rap some triplets. You don't have to elongate your words either, if you feel a syllable should be a sixteenth dont be afraid to do that. It may be hard to rap the first time but when you do get it, it's going to be another tool in your repetoire that'll open up your writing and your flow pattern 10 fold.

3) weed: cause who doesn't love Mary J

4) LSD: the only psychedelic that I actually find appealing. The low body load and brilliant headspace make it the perfect psychedelic, IMO. Also, candyflipping is my favorite drug combination.

It's an average Wednesday night, and my boyfriend is making dinner because I have an awful headache. We decided to have mashed potatoes as a side and a salad. Now when he makes mashed potatoes he likes the skins and I don't, I deal with it for him but really I'm already dreading dinner because of the skins. 

Fast forward to the mashing of the potatoes and I see him go to the fridge and grab the cheese. Okay, no big deal he will put it on his when he serves his plate. Nope. Decided to throw half a bag of cheese into the mashed potatoes without consulting me first. I feel the rage and sadness build up and fight the urge to cry. I get over it as much as I can. Once he gives me my plate I sit down and avoid the potatoes for a few bites. Finally muster up the courage to eat them........ Dammit...... They are DELICIOUS.

Take any ol' square synth, play a chord and make all the notes real short in the visual piano roll in your DAW (depending on BPM, could be 1/32, 1/64) and have them concatenate depending on the type of arpeggio you want. 

I can't explain this well without giving printscreens or anything, but a two bar three note arpeggio would look [something like this in FL](http://i.ytimg.com/vi/EjWZiNYuXPg/maxresdefault.jpg).

The anger at the government itself is real, and it exists for valid reasons, but the Tea Party was cajoled into existence by wealthy interests to oppose people actually realizing they have been sold up the river and have been losing purchasing power and income. [The average families income has dropped by $5000, while the super wealthy now take in more than they used to, while paying even less in taxes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) But they use divisive issues like this to confuse people. Who gives a crap what other people do, unless they are actively hurting you? Your gay neighbors aren't hurting America, but the super wealthy are, by no longer paying their fair share of taxes, like they used to, and that helped create and sustain the power of the American middle class.

Most people are not going to be able to pass on more than 10 million in equity to *each* of their kids (and that's currrently tax free), but the opposition by people who will never even reach that wealth to having the wealthy (the people who have a lot more than 10 million) pay a *fair* tax on their wealth is really mind-boggling.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","well, if you believe trans women are women and if lesbians are women who are interested in women, then we can conclude that trans women who are interested in women are lesbians, right? 

you seem to be operating under the idea that after a certain time of HRT, a person's brain becomes more feminized and therefore this person has a right to call themselves a woman, and therefore a lesbian. which is... odd! hormones aren't what defines gender completely... they are just things that help ease dysporia and better allign our bodies with our minds! there are plenty of trans women who don't even use hormones at all... (some can't afford it, some are scared, some just don't want them). and if they live their lives as women, indentify as women, and date other women, then i believe they have the lesbian lived experience!

edit: i'm thinking more about this, and i think your post is a great example of the obsession with hormones i see around here. kind of like how mainstream media talks about trans people in terms of pre-sex-change and post-sex-change, as if ""the surgery"" is this discrete marker that changes a person from man to woman, i feel like a lot of people here treat hormones as if it's the new ""the surgery"". as in, something absolutely necessary and instrumental to the trans experience. we even divide trans peeps between ""pre-hrt"" and ""after hrt"" as if everybody wants hormones! like trans people who aren't on hormones aren't really trans people. the idea, too, that after a while you are ""too old"" for hormones to have any effect and therefore it's not even worth it to transition is something reaaally harmful that i see a lot...

i'm not dismissing the importance of hormones or anything, that's a super important thing to me, just saying we should be more open about other ways to transition and be trans.","1438387867"

So you're complaining about not being able to beat vets despite being able to beat vets? Doing what you did was exactly what you need to do to be able to beat the people with more SP.

&gt; I just can't have the required skills because of the training system.

You can't get level 80 right away in WoW, either. There aren't very many games that give you end-game content right away, and those that do generally don't last long (as they get boring rather quickly).

I honestly don't get your complaint, though. You seem to be upset that you can't compete with multi-year vets, but yet you just stated that you're capable of competing with multi-year vets.

What is your actual issue?","1438387869"

"YAwriters","t5_2vtil","You can portray *anything* in YA so long as it's not gratuitous.  Sex? Violence? Drug use? Profanity? All fine so long as you have a reason for those things.  In my experience you can get away with writing anything as long as you can justify it.

There are actually two books (for me) that exemplify just how far a writer can really go.  They're both by Daniel Kraus.  *Rotters* and *Scowler*.  *Rotters* is about a young man who ends up grave robbing with his estranged father.  *Scowler* is far more difficult to describe, but it contains one of the most horrifying scenes I've ever read in YA.  A young man finds his mother (both of whom are abused by the father) sewn to her mattress.  I almost couldn't finish the book at that point, but the scene was necessary.  The scene wasn't gratuitous.  It served a purpose.

Both of those books are amazing, by the way, but serve as great examples of just how dark YA can go.

I'd also throw out *Bunker Diary* by Kevin Brooks.  I haven't read it yet, but from everything I've heard, it's really, really dark.

Agreed. I have checked out azure, rackspace, and AWS pricing and just can't justify the expense.

&gt; I spec'd out a Dell T320/R320 (Still debating on whether I want to go rack) for about $4,000 w/warranty and everything included. 

Hey, I was looking at the R320 as well. The R210 didn't quite seem to cut it for what I wanted.

&gt; The problem I am having is deciding on drives for the server.

I'm planning on either aftermarket SSDs, I think, for the same reason that Dell drives are super pricy.

I haven't used a Samsung Pro 850 specifically, but I'll definitely check them out. 

In general, I don't think the disk load on these is going to be all that high and so I'm not too worried about the SSD degradation issues that I would with a heavily churning database server.  That said, I don't really know much about it yet.

We don't have a ton of agents yet, so I want to be smart about planning for the future, but I also know that hardware in a year or two will be cheaper/better so I'm just trying to get something in place and then I can see what to do from there.

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","It may look like there is a ton of sidewalk but please don't park there ever again. You are lucky you only got a ticket. The building manager could have had you towed without warning... and that is really expensive.

Pro tips if you are looking for parking -

- Just down the street at 9th and Grant is a parking lot for the Denver Public Schools building. It is legal to park there on weekends and I believe evenings. 

- Much of Logan opens up for parking on the left hand side after a certain hour / weekends

- Always look at least block or two away from the 10 story condos around the place pictured. Always tricky because a ton of people live in those buildings and not all have parking spots.  

- Even at 12 at night, there is someone pulling their car out somewhere within a few blocks. It is a pretty active area. You can't give up looking after just a few minutes if you are relying on public spots to park. 

- Always more likely to find a space on a street with houses over a street with apartments

- Rent a space if you want the luxury of owning a car around capitol hill without having to be a master at parallel parking. I say luxury because that is what it is to own a car, you are never entitled to a space like the one you chose just because you own a car. There is always another option, even if seemingly inconvenient. ","1438387882"

Defensive player lays out in front of offensive player and O player what, trips over the other player?  Again barring dangerous play (not allowing enough time to react type of thing) the defender now has an occupied space and if that's in the way of where the offensive player is trying to go and the offensive player initiates the contact, no foul.

"pcmasterrace","t5_2sgp1","Saying it doesn't support anything I do isn't aggressive. I use my PC for gaming, and I currently only really play GTA, which Linux does not do. Saying Linux is ""fine for gaming"" is just delusional, and I'm sure even a lot of Linux users would agree with me on that. Has it made some progress? Absolutely. But it is nowhere near the level Windows is on, and therefore I, along with a vast majority of gamers, wouldn't even consider it an option for gaming seriously.

And when we are on the topic of me *switching* from *Windows* to *Linux* it should be pretty obvious that I already have experience on the Windows OS. Therefore, it is simply easier to learn Windows 10 which just came out than it would be to learn any form of Linux which is vastly different from what I used to. I really don't get what you are trying to argue here, I am most definitely more used to Windows and that should be obvious just from the fact we are on the topic of switching and not trying to learn the two with no prior experience.

Saying *my* reasons on the decision for *me* to not use Linux aren't valid is a pretty ignorant statement. Especially when you try to act as if Linux is valid for gaming, when it simply isn't. And if the community isn't ""hating"" on me every time they try to force Linux down my throat, they sure as hell are good at acting like they are. I see Windows users get shit constantly, when the vocal minority of Linux users don't understand that we simply don't care. We all know the reasons to switch, and if we wanted to we most certainly would have by now.","1438387886"

Plus all the evidence so far has pointed in drakes favor. And his assumption that Drake responded for damage control bothers me. I mean that could certainly be the case but from what I've seen the evidence points that Drake knew Meek had no real footing in his accusations. The reference tracks and bouncing ideas off other writers doesn't seem to be a big deal to anyone and drake knew that. So he could make a diss track and put the burden of proof and pressure on meek, knowing he had none. It made for an easy win and made him even more popular, it was a win-win, Discredits Meeks accusations and makes himself more popular and respected. It was a move calculated by drake very well. At least that's how I'm seeing it. Could be utterly and completely wrong.","1438387887"

THIS is really bugging him.  It's an issue separate from the cheating aspect.  She had a threesome. She had a sex life before him.  It's almost like....OP is mad at her for it.  I'm guessing OP wasn't very sexually experienced before he met his gf, and is letting that make him feel inadequate. THAT is not his gf's problem.  It's OP's.

If the Artist meets an appropriate powerful intelligent creature, it may decide to become the Artist's Patron. The creature must actively agree with the Artist's goals and freely desire an alliance (not merely be bluffed or controlled, etc.)

The patron must have at least two more natural creature HD AND two more total HD than the Artist. For example, presuming the Artist is of a standard 1-HD PC race, the Patron must be at least a 3-HD base creature, not just a fellow PC-race type with two more levels.

But if the Artist overtakes the total HD of the Patron by class level advancement, the creature can no longer be her Patron. But this is easy to avoid with Experience Point sharing.

The Artist and her Patron may share any XP either earns as a pool as they choose. If the creature has plenty of spare HD, they may prefer to channel all towards the Artist so that she advances as quickly as possible. Or they can split the XP evenly so that each gains an Alchemist level at the same time and their HD difference remains static.

Patron Creature is not so much a Class Feature as a prerequisite for later Discoveries. Unlike a familiar, the Artist can't just summon a patron, she has to go out and find it and negotiate with it.","1438387889"

"technology","t5_2qh16","Youre right, it cant. But can *we* predict what the computer will do? 

Yes computers have excellent reaction time and can monitor many variables at once. But reaction time is not everything. The problem lies in the unpredictability of driving. Even a computer will not be ready for it. And most of all, it wont be ready for the decision making that goes into driving. What is the primary directive of the self driving car? Is it to avoid accidents at all costs? Is it to obey traffic laws at all costs? Is it to ensure safety at all costs? Those things cannot happen simultaneously at all times. So the computer will have to prioritize.

So for example to avoid an accident you may have to break a traffic law right? But how far are we willing to let self driving cars go? Take this scenario: You driving along in your self driving car and someone runs into the street without looking. Regardless of reaction time, cars cannot stop on a dime. Its going to hit that person. So will it hit the brakes and hit that person at a slower speed or swerve out of the way? What if it swerve out of the way, hits a ditch and your car flips over an rolls down an embankment? So you probably want safety to be first. But for who? Does the car protect the driver, its owner, at all costs? Or will it sacrifice your safety for the 'greater good'?

Is the safety of me and my passengers always the top priority of this computer? Or will it sacrifice my safety to save a bus load of kids? But what if I dont want my (the driver's) safety to be top priority? My wife and kids are in the car. If the car has a split second to swerve to make the impact less severe, who will it be less severe for? Will it protect the driver at all costs?

Given the right set of circumstances, will this machine make the conscious decision to endanger the life of my passenger in order to save me?

The completely autonomous vehicle that reddit seems to think is coming down the pipeline is nothing more than a pipe dream at this point. People will reject this technology when the figure out the implications it has. Its like airplanes, they have the power to run completely on their own but will always require two humans just in case. The same goes for cars.

Will a self driving car do what is logical or what is right or will it do what I tell it to?","1438387893"

The archers were just out of earshot, and were exchanging creative insults back and fourth directed at the captain.

&gt;Hoisting only occurs on variables that are not declared with a keyword.

As far as I can tell this is wrong.  Here's a quote from MDN:

&gt;In JavaScript, functions and variables are hoisted. Hoisting is JavaScript's behavior of moving declarations to the top of a scope (the global scope or the current function scope).

[(source)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting)

And

&gt;Because variable declarations (and declarations in general) are processed before any code is executed, declaring a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's declared. This behavior is called ""hoisting"", as it appears that the variable declaration is moved to the top of the function or global code.

[(source)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting)

Note how NONE of this says anything about moving variables BETWEEN scopes, but only WITHIN scopes.  

That is to say, your claim that the variable `b` in the above code is moved into the global scope and `var`'d is something I've never heard before.  Instead, all variables are by default added to the global object *unless* the `var` keyword is used, then they're scoped within the function.  While what you say might be functionally equivalent, I don't believe it's how JS actually works under the hood.  If you've got anything saying otherwise though I'd love to hear it, I'm the first to admit I don't know everything about this.

Also, as far as you original quote about hoisting only occurring on variables not declared with a keyword, consider the following sample from the OP (comment is mine):

    var a = 'value';

    (function() {
      alert(a); 
      var a = 'value2'; //declared with a keyword, still hoisted above the alert.
    })();


tl;dr I still think this has to due with `var` and the global object (window) and not hoisting, but would love to be convinced otherwise if it means I learn something new.

If you just walk up and go ""Uh, hi."" and just stand there, you're demanding they give you some of their energy while you just sit there and soak it up, giving nothing back. They're going to wish you'd leave. 

If you walk up with intent and put energy into their conversation, they're much more likely to be glad you joined in. ""Hey guys, what's going on? Where can I get a drink around here eh? I'm RKO_OUTA_NOWHERE, what's yours?""

And then my boyfriend, who was a medical student at the time, basically charted for me.  Just constant updates about my vitals and other numbers, tests I was getting, meds, results, etc.  Completely unemotional, yet he knew it was exactly what both of us needed.

It was months before I could even read the stuff from my friends and relatives.  It would give me panic attacks.  But reading the charting from my bf was extremely calming, even when it was essentially, ""All of your numbers point to death within 3-6 hours.

A lot of kids nowadays are fixated on lifting weights and ""getting big"", and steroids are a means to that end. They'll do anything to look tough to their friends (aside from actually joining the wrestling team or practicing another martial art, that is).

As for amongst wrestlers... I can only think of two, maybe three examples. One came a generation before me, and he was the butt of a lot of jokes for his usage. The next was this kid who transferred in from New Jersey, who probably spent more time in the weight room than he actually did on the mats. It was never confirmed 100%, but everyone said that he was juicing, and I definitely believed it. Even though he couldn't shoot a double leg to save his life, the kid could squat a school bus. The last suspected one was this lanky runner who bulked up and put a good twenty pounds of muscle on over the course of a few months. Super nice, quiet kid though. I'd like to believe it was all natural.

So no, it's actually not that common. But then again, it may be different amongst the top tier schools with truly elite programs. There is probably far more pressure to use when it can mean the difference between a national title.","1438387903"

I get why people like Rin since she is very attractive and probably has a nice personality if you're into tsundere (which I am not, with few exceptions), but what draws people to Yuckyno, I'll never understand.

Anyway. This round, you basically get to decide who wins, (Gahara or Holo), so pick wisely. By wisely, I mean pick Gahara. ""But FlagonWagon-sama! You just said you don't like tsundere! Why'd you want me to vote for her?"" It's because she's not a tsundere, ya four-fingered dunce cap. She's what happens when you throw all the -dere archetypes in a food processor and set that bitch on frappè. She's a little mean, a little shy, a little loving, a little crazy, a lot clever, and a hell of a lot [insanely hot](http://38.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mc72ijRcF91rhfy09o1_500.gif). Hold your horses there, my little magpies. I ain't saying Holo isn't awesome too. If the salt gods were just, they'd both at least make the final four, but it's time to learn that the salt gods don't care about you and yours. If they did, would all the NGE girls be out before the finals? Would Illya? I thought not. So if you gotta pick one right now you might as well pick the one that makes your neurons jump as much as your hose. Vote Gahara.

Never seen NGNL, so I got no dog in that fight, but I'm rooting hard for ya, Megumi. You'll always be best in my heart, but I can't prepare a case for ya against an enemy I know nothing about.","1438387903"

I know when you're doing awful or just getting shut down it feels like you can't win, but especially with arena I've come back from ridiculous deficits when no one on the team gave the fuck up and everyone started coordinating. 

It's amazing how much of this game is mental fuckery. Even in conquest, one good deicide can turn the game completely around. Yes it's not often and yes it's more fun to win, but it's a competitive game, there is always a loser. But the first loser is the one to f6 when there is still a real game to be played. The most satisfying and enjoyable wins are the ones you fought hard for. And the most enjoyable wins are the ones that don't end in a surrender and the enemy team put up a fight even when it was stacked against them.

&gt; 3. Especially, he should not believe too readily that a person is 
possessed by an evil spirit; but he ought to ascertain the signs 
by which a person possessed can be distinguished from one who is 
suffering from some illness, especially one of a psychological 
nature.[1] Signs of possession may be the following: ability to 
speak with some facility in a strange tongue or to understand it 
when spoken by another; the faculty of divulging future and 
hidden events; display of powers which are beyond the subject's 
age and natural condition; and various other indications which, 
when taken together as a whole, build up the evidence.

From other documents I gather some of the following indications:

* Changed physical appearance (levitation, twisted face)
* Changed voice
* Objects moving around in the room

Aaaand lastly.. from personal experience:

* Changed physical appearance of the subject (fangs)
* Sudden bleeding from the subject's mounth
* Puffed up hair
* Scratching pain when praying or mentioning Jesus Christ

Matter of opinion.  Can you prove ""dodgy bookkeeping"" ?

They haven't paid what you believe is truly owed in corporation tax because factors brought their tax liability down.  You know that a portion of Starbucks' outlets run at a loss? Large corporations keep unprofitable stores running as 'loss leaders'.  These losses rightly should reduce tax due.  

Capital allowances, tax losses, writing off bad debts owed inward.  There are loads of factors that can bring a company's tax liability down.

So, I agree it doesn't matter whether the input is small or large.  (Although I suspect the majority of angry people are angry at the small input more than anything else).  But, I do not believe Starbucks have acted illegally or broken any rules or laws.  They have operated their business and at the the end of the year their profits have been small.

(Bear in mind, company profits brings in corporation tax.  If Directors of the company take a massive salary this will make profits appear to be small.  But, those massive salaries are subject to income tax on the persons.  Income tax is generally set higher than corporation tax (at least in the UK), thus it's swing and roundabouts at a 'contributing to the government tax coffers' level).

My point is this.  It doesn't matter what ""type"" of tax you label it as.  The tax revenue still reaches the inland revenue regardless.  It might have a different label, such as income tax or VAT, but it still gets there and it's still proportional to the sales of a corporation.

If a corporation pays very little corporation tax you normally find the shareholder and directors paid a large amount in income tax.  And vice versa.  Simplified example of course.

The general rationale behind the tax system is that single things are not taxed over and over again.

Logical fallicy:  Moving the goal post.

You explicitly stated that the quality of what can be purchased today versus in the 1950's colors the discussion, no weaseling out permitted.  Capitalism is definitely efficient, and does not care what the market used to think, but this is fundamentally incompatible with your previously stated beleifs.

&gt;It is only known organizing principle that maximizes economic freedom and prosperity

Absolute freedom is absolute tyranny.  Our founding fathers knew and recognized that, so did hamilton and many of the philosphers credited with the present incarnation of capitalism (which in ideology  is much older than 300 years).  

It is abundently clear from modern history that the captains pf industry can not be relied upon to carry out the mission of successful industrialists: To make the most profit possible from a decent product while maximizing employee compensation.  If they cannot be trusted to trickle their wealth downstream, it is reasonable for society to inact regulations to break up the blood clots of concentrated wealth, and prevent new ones from forming.

Rules like that often times exist because one or two individuals proved they can cause damage without them.  

&gt;All collectivist systems steal from some to the benefit of others.

People who use text without audio to communicate, whether on the Internet or their cell phones, frequently misinterpret the tone of others. To the extent that it is cliché to mention it.

Regardless, until you share with us an example from the text to support your claim, it appears to be a shitpost.

&gt; Given your hostile tone I'm not really convinced that I can have a honest discourse with you.

I am capable of being both hostile and honest.

Your first comment ended with this:

When you insult a community by suggesting its members to not be ""level headed"", is that not a slightly hostile thing to say?

Civil laws are structuring principles of man's life in society. As such, they play a very important and sometimes decisive role in influencing patterns of thought and behavior. They externally shape the life of society, but also profoundly modify everyone’s perception and evaluation of forms of behavior.

Legal recognition of same-sex “marriage” would necessarily obscure certain basic moral values, devalue traditional marriage, and weaken public morality.

Considering it was all penned during a time of political crisis, I have to believe they were concerned about both the individual and the community.

So last night I got a call off my Dad in England, shittest news I have ever had.....my 42 year old half brother dropped dead yesterday, no known cause at present.

I haven't shed a tear in years, the anti-depressants that I used for 4 years have broken that mechanism ( true ). Well now I know that the crying bit is well and truly working. 

Goodness my eyes are so puffed up right now. My brother leaves behind a 5 month expectant wife, two grown up children, and two Grandchildren, oh and my Dad and other family members that are older than 42, me included.

I am pretty devastated right now, this has never happened to me before. Loosing parents is one thing, and sadly to be expected, to lose my Brother that is 10 years younger than me is a totally different ball game, a game that has knocked me sideways severely.

Oh on a good point, I got my expensive binoculars back from the pub...........so I've got that going for me.

Do me a favour, go give someone that you truly love a hug, it's from me, but probably best not to tell them that *Bolax* sent it over the internet, it could confuse them too much.

Beyond that problem, figuring out the real value of insurance is also extremely complicated. For example you have to take into account how much it would hurt to pay for the whole thing yourself or not get the repairs/replacement. If the item is something you absolutely need and you can't afford to replace it, it may well be worth paying for insurance to avoid the risk. On the other hand, if it's something you can do without or pay for a replacement, it comes down to probability and money spent vs money possibly saved, or basically gambling.","1438387920"

""that"" is a relative clause marker, like in the previous sentence, which modifies ""door"". Essentially, because this is a head final framework, with subjects last, the entire sentence comes out backwards from the English.   
  
&gt; chair the knocked.over that door the knocked.over man the.  
  
We'll start with the clause [that knocked.over the chair]. We switch the subject and object and place the determiner after the noun to get [chair the knocked.over that].  
  
This whole phrase is the object of ""door"", which is its head. So we place that after the clause along with its determiner after that: [Chair the knocked.over that door the].  
  
This whole phrase is the object of the first ""knocked.over"". So we switch the subject and object around this verb to get: ""Chair the knocked.over that door the knocked.over man the.""  
  
As for the cases, ""man"" obviously gets nominative, since it's the subject. Since ""door"" is the object of the first ""knocked.over"" and ""chair"" the object of the second ""knocked.over, both would receive an accusative case marker. The dative case is most commonly used for indirect objects. These are usually the recipients of actions, such as ""Mary"" in the following two sentences:  
John gave the ball *to Mary*

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Each donation takes anywhere from 5-35 eggs depending. The eggs you are born with, millions, die everyday. Menopause happens when you have no more eggs. 

So you are born with millions of eggs, but because these eggs die, after ~15 years 30% of your eggs have already died. Menopause typically happens in your 50's, when you have 0% of your eggs.

It's just math. A number of eggs survive and exist at a given time in a womens ovary. If you remove some of the eggs in an ovary there are less eggs than before. If you have 500 eggs and remove 10, than you have 490. 

So donating can leave you with no eggs if you only have that small amount left, for whatever reason. So as I first said, because of that the person could choose to not donate to the family member because they would be left infertile. Doctors screen your viability, they can give you the green light, lots of healthy eggs to choose from with no worries of infertility, or they can have the opposite results. 

That's why doctors screen, it's not anything to argue about. Donation has the possibility to leave you infertile, but not without your prior knowledge and consent. ","1438387924"

"stevenuniverse","t5_2viyl","All sorts of things.

The cervical disks serve as a sort of shock pad or shock absorber in your spine. Rather than your vertebrae just smashing up against one another whenever you run, you've got these cartilaginous disks that suck up most of the movement and keep your spine from grinding down over time. There's a similar membrane around pretty well all of your joints. 

But sometimes the shock is too much for the pads to absorb, and they get damaged. It can come from sustained pressure (running twice a day for a year after not running for a bunch of years), or it can come from an injury. Sometimes they just grind down based on your posture and your genetics; some people don't have cervical disks as thick as other people, and they just sort of wear down faster than other folks'. 

Most of the time, this sort of damage is handled with physiotherapy or spinal injections. It's only if the condition stays bad that they consider replacement. ","1438387927"

He does. This fall he's teaching a (legendary) class with Simon Critchley on Mysticism.

I do know he teaches some undergrads; last semester he had a course on Nietzsche.

They also claim it's a psychedelic.

David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist, claimed in 2009 that MDMA is [""no more dangerous than horse riding""](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/4537874/Ecstasy-no-more-dangerous-than-horse-riding.html). Really? I'm not trying to underestimate the professional, but I think that a drug that couldn't be used safely on a daily basis is not less dangerous than horse riding.

The psychedelic matter really seems to be controversial, though, but the issue is that MDMA is usually classified as a very light drug, like LSD, Psilocybin and DMT.","1438387932"

A great handful of my friends with 8-16 year olds parrot some of the things you're going through. These people dote on and coddle their children. One mother can't afford to drive to her job some months, but she makes sure the kids get to go to 6 flags biweekly and are doted on. She gives up everything for them, and the oldest one is just the biggest fucking shit. When she complains about her daughter, I told her to start taking shit away. She wouldn't, of course, but you have to get tough on kids.

If you don't mind me asking, is she ever physically violent? Because if she is, it reminds me of those stories that go around about schizophrenic children that are unholy terrors and are extremely violent towards their siblings. I know absolutely NOTHING about the illness, but it just reminded me of those stories :\

"Bitcoin","t5_2s3qj","No it doesn't go against what Bitcoin stands for, because if you completely unbalance the incentive mechanisms of the network you destroy all that value. You make it useless, you make it less secure, you open up a shit ton of attack avenues that did not previously exist. The token is a unit of account ON THE NETWORK. It is not its own independent thing, simply defining in simplistic terms such as money is dumbing down what it really is, A PART OF THE NETWORK. 

Sidechains don't just fuck with your tokens, they fuck with mine, they fuck with everyone's. You are arrogant beyond belief if you feel entitled to alter the nature of the network in a way that affects everyone, not based on your market activity, whether you buy or sell, but by your action to fundamentally alter the nature of the network. You fuck with me doing that, not just yourself. And that is fucking arrogant and self righteous beyond belief. 

And again by the way, you COMPLETELY ignore and step around the fact that the network and token are inseparable and work in tandem, and make an ad hominem plea to people reading based on the instinctual reaction to money as it exists now rather than the intellectual definition and distinction between Bitcoin and current money. Not to mention the complete strawman of accusing me of trying to prevent people accessing and controlling their own tokens on the network, WHICH IS IN NO WAY WHAT IS DONE BY MAINTAINING THE CURRENT NETWORK STRUCTURE.

Aren't two out of the seven you know genuinely nice? How would they feel if you excluded them?

&gt; When have cis lesbians been this creepy?

Honestly I can't give you specific examples. But I also couldn't give you examples of creepy trans lesbians.

&gt; but it's not as commonplace as it is for those who are socialized as men

It's becoming more commonplace for trans people to be socialized as their gender as children. I'm assuming you've seen news stories and such about them. I know they're kids now, but surely this would change things in the future, yes? Forgive me as this is not entirely relevant to your qualms but I felt the need to point it out.

&gt; Is my safety less important than letting these trans women be ridiculous like this?

I never said that your safety doesn't matter. I didn't get the vibe that you were in danger. Uncomfortable, yes, but not danger. Forgive me on that.

I suppose I'm asking you to reevaluate your exclusion because this is the sort of thing that halts any sort of progress. This sentiment goes beyond trans people. But now I'm derailing.

Anyways, based on your situation, I'm not sure how to help you. I suppose you are just ranting as trying to push the trans gals out probably wouldn't go in your favor. Maybe you could assemble a new outing group with other girls who have felt similarly?","1438387938"

To the west of it, all the way down you'll get to the bush parks and all the way to the east you'll reach the Galleria area, it's a big ass mall about 4 stories high. Then you'll reach the Montrose area, where they have all the mom and pops shops and vintage stores. Then you have midtown where all the bars/clubs are at.

Once again, can someone kill you and donate your organs to advance medicine? You are worthless to the medical community but your organs are very important to science....

&gt; What do you mean consent? Something the size of a bean that did not have the structures to think or feel should be able to consent now?

If he did produce a copy, we would be having this same conversation about whether it was authentic or an elaborate fabrication.

His stated goal was to expose the secret mass gathering of information, that was what he did.

We have a choice to believe an individual who experienced great personal loss to expose a system he has stated he felt was wrong, sent emails expressing those concerns. In so doing we would also believe a group that has stood in front of congress under oath and lied about the self same topic:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/01/27/darrell-issa-james-clapper-lied-to-congress-about-nsa-and-should-be-fired/

Would continue to lie to attempt to discredit this individual and make themselves look less terrible.

Or, we can believe that a whistle-blower chose to bring up his concerns with the nation and risk Jail time to avoid sending an email to his supervisor on the topic. And although the NSA lies about a lot of very important things, they are telling the truth this time.

One of these scenarios just doesn't sound right to me.

We have no proof and I doubt if there were any proof it wouldn't have been scrubbed by now. I could be wrong and I doubt I will ever know for certain who is telling the truth here, but I feel pretty secure operating on the notion that the NSA is full of lies and this is just another one.","1438387947"

Regarding turret damage - there are two general scenarios:

1) You're behind a little / the enemy botlane doesn't have much range. Hit them. In the face. A lot. The turrets pack a punch during laning phase and you will scare the enemy off quickly by standing your ground. Work together with your support, try to cc them, as their wave dies / they draw aggro. This whole thing only works if you didn't get poked down before the wave hits the tower.

2) Big lead / long range / Tristana/Jinx/Alistar. In every case contesting your tower is sort of hard, as the enemy botlane is either quick at shredding the tower or can just stay safe during a dive. Just drop the tower then and freeze at your inner one. If the enemy bot keeps going, collaps on them with 3-4 people and claw back into the game like that. Remember to warn your teammates about you freezing, though. You won't do anything, while the enemy bot has to find other things to entertain themselves with. For example your midlane. ","1438387949"

As for the sound, the first thing I notice vs my Sophia Princess is:

A: A lack of treble/upper hardness at loud volumes

B: A far more holographic soundstage

As for weaknesses, I think the raytheons just might be slight less detailed in bass. But we'll see as the tubes/my brain burns in. It's also less tubey (read: harmonic distortion) and more dry sounding but you won't mistake this as a solid state. It's also alot less pretty FWIW, but I think its got its charm from a historical and utilitarian standpoint.

edit: Further impressions seems that the tubes offer a bit more detail and and bass while just as detailed as the rest of the sound, is slightly lower in quantity vs my Sophia.

Most foods in the grocery store happen to have these standards of rat excrement and insects. Even local farmer's market stuff isn't safe. 

Bottom line is that if you're living in modern society with mass-produced food and grocery stores you've probably eaten rat excrement and insects at some point in your life. It's not a big deal. 

Finally, I'm not trying to come off like a jerk or something by commenting on this. It's more that I'm trying to point out that both of these foods have their nasty flaws and we eat them anyway :P

"leaves","t5_2s9i3","I think on a lot of levels I knew for a while that bud was becoming an obstacle to the life I want to lead, but chose to ignore that and single out all other causes as the root of my problems - all while getting high constantly and justifying my own use of cannabis as a crutch.

For me, personally, I had two separate but related straws:

Firstly, I have an amazing partner, who's supportive, caring, understanding and actually doesn't object to smoking in itself, and I began lying to them about my consumption and choosing time with a J over time with them. I mean, honestly, what the fuck.

The second 'straw' happened during a night I was high AF in the middle of the night. I went to the bathroom, in just a pair of shorts, and for the first time in a while looked at myself in a mirror. And by that I mean honestly looked. I saw a torso which, whilst never overly muscular, was once in pretty good shape as the result of playing sports throughout my life now looking pale and malnourished. I saw an unshaven beard, puffy eyes with all the diluted blood vessels, food crusted into the corner of my mouth and filthy shorts that had bits of bud clinging to them. Started welling up on the spot, and before I knew it I was just rooted staring at myself in the mirror and literally bawling my eyes out *as a direct consequence of my relationship with something that had started out as an enjoyable pastime*.","1438387951"

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Rather than a need being a justification, it's more so that you must do it regardless - as it is something necessary - however, despite this, doing something morally reprehensible will not be excused - such as murdering another human. Whether or not mass farming an animal for consumption is morally reprehensible is up to the individual.

Basic need isn't probably the most accurate way to put it, essentially you do have a basic need for what meat provides - sure, there are other options but there is nothing inherently wrong with using meat as the source. There's something you need, meat provides it, so I suppose it IS a basic need, however meat is not the sole provider of it.

And finally, it's not so much Cecil and Chickens are ""meant"" for a purpose, and it's not unusual for other animals to be bred for a purpose - or humans to be conceived for a purpose. However, the purpose for which you bred them is not inherently justified simply because you bred them. Again, this is something for the individual decides. But, when it comes to eating chicken versus killing Cecil, is the repercussions are differing in severity. It's the difference between killing one in a thousand, and one in a million. In one case the population suffers a loss of .1% and in the other a loss of .0001%. Type of animal and use aside, the impact is already widely different.","1438387952"

Some of it will be limited by your natural ability, biy all can be learned to some degree.As far as religion goes, witchcraft is a way of life. Some religions, if not most, incorporate magic to some extent . Fun fact: This includes Christianity :p Whether or not you will pursue witchcraft as part of a religion will determine what sort of magic you will focus on as well as influence how you will go about learning magic.For example, Wicca is first and foremost a nature centered religion that worships male and female aspects of the Divine. Secondary to this, many, but not all, Wiccans practice energy work as part of a ritual to worship the Divine. Sometimes these Wiccans also branch into other areas of magic such as herbalism and astrology and numerous other sub-magics and they use their abilities outside of ritual work as well.Edit: Words are hard","1438387952"

After that, he was angry at everyone involved. He's always upset when Skyler tells people about what he considers his private matters (often a bit unreasonably, as things like this certainly affect her life as well as his). But this goes beyond that; he's angry at her for inadvertently playing a role in his humiliation, and anyway he can't very well yell at Elliot. 

None of which is to say he'd necessarily have been open to the idea  or that he would be grateful to Elliot or Skyler for it, even if Elliot had approached it more tactfully.

The mot important point I see that should be shared was your reluctance to ""discuss"" matters. Fucking brilliant. Communication is the standard BP advice, but this tactic fails miserably in the field

 We are human and our bluepill conditioning is to wonder why she felt the need to end this marriage. Same with the ""reconciliation""....bluepill man wants to know if we can save this etc.

Let your woman worry about the relationship. Its revolting to her when you do it, as she knows that's her job. Women are suspicious of a man needing her in the same way you would wonder why a bird keeps flying into his cage. Or a prisoner breaking into jail.

Also.... You rightfully don't seem upset. You were a fat beta and she wasn't happy. Can you blame her?  We can debate why we didn't learn to display masculine traits earlier but it's beyond silly to blame our women for not loving us for who we are.


It's how you make them feel boys. They want a rollercoaster of emotions and they need to chase you. Give them the room to do it. Plant doubts you are permanently there for her. Make sure if you did break up then you have an active full life to continue and women will line up to replace the ex. 

It's beyond comprehension but we all accept TRP truth that this is also the strategy to KEEP your woman.

But if you don't want a relationship, you should let them know (at a reasonable time, but not necessarily right away) what your intentions are.

"letsgofish","t5_2sclf","Yes, true talent level [is a thing] (http://www.fangraphs.com/library/understanding-projections-true-talent-level-and-variability/). 

Think about it this way: the odds of a fair coin landing on heads is 50/50. That's the ""true probability"" of that coin. Now, flip a coin 20 times. What was the result you got? Repeat the process 9 times. In each set of 20, how often was the result exactly 10/10? Maybe half the time? Sometimes random weird things happen, so the individual 20 throw samples don't match the actual odds, but over 200 coin throws, you're going yo be pretty close to the true probability (100/100). If you flipped 2,000 coins, it would be even closer to 1000/1000, even if one random sample might show a 0/10 split. 

With Baker, his track record (~2000 PA) suggests a level of production (.296	/350/.509	vs. LHP) that given enough PAs, he will perform at. Even if a small segment of that production looks bad, it's not indicative that he's gotten worse. Just that he hasn't happened to perform well in this slice of his career. 

The Marlins are keeping Rojas/Gillespie because they're performed well in limited time. That doesn't mean they're any better, that they're more likely to perform better going forward, just that they *happened* to perform better in the recent past. That's short sighted, just as trading Tulo for Hech would be short sighted of the Rockies on May 1, 2015. 

Who cares about ""talent""? 

###The Marlins should care about talent!! 

If they want to field a competitive team, you need talented players. Can you imagine a scenario where the Marlins gave **John Baker** a big contract because he performed well in September of 2011?

Had another, all my fault.  2am exodus of the bar.  Saw the most beautiful girl I had ever seen in my whole life.  I figured, screw it, worst that can happen is my nightly run on strikeouts would simply increase by 1.  So I made nice talk in the parking lot then asked here for her phone number.  SHE GAVE IT TO ME!  Later set up a dinner date.  Turns out beer goggle are a real thing.  She was as wide as she was tall.

Another online encounter, turned up a girl that was very unattractive, I tried to escape by using the ""creepy guy, potential rapist or murder"" act so she would be the one to bow out.

Tears falling like rain needs to go. We've heard it. It isn't new or clever and its impact is gone. Find another - fresh way to talk about how the tears come or better yet, find a more clever way to indicate crying without mentioning tears. One of my fave lines anywhere is the first line in Shotgun Blues that says what you are saying - but in a fresher way. ""Every night I go to sleep - the blues fall down like rain"" does the same job in a slicker way.

That is just one. Dreams died. Blind eye. Final fate (planning suicide?) etc. those are all oft repeated expressions robbed of any meaningful impact.

My other tip for you is to get more concrete. I'm having trouble getting a read on just what is going on. This is another novice trap.

I want to commend you on writing a whole song and more for putting it out there. I don't care much if you go back and rework this song - I do care that your next song is better. They always are.

Finally - I want to encourage you to read ""Writing Better Lyrics"" by Pat Pattison. It will help you a lot.","1438387966"

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","I'm huge fan of supreme commander and of starcraft 2 too. At high level in supcom the strategies are extremely complicated, because there is much more buildings to build than in sc2 so there is much more builds and they have to be vastly different for each map. Supcom has little micro and I agree there could be more, but supcom is more based on mass-micro, where you manage groups of 20 units attacking from one side, then 20 from another side and then 10 from behind. In starcraft 2, the pace of the game and apm requirement is so high that designing such deliberate flanks and attacks on multiple fronts are just extremely hard to pull off. 

Another very good thing about supcom is automatized unit production - you set up a queue of units. For starcraft players it seems really extreme, but think about it. What's so fun about having to press A 30 times to build 30 marines and 30 Z to build 60 zerglings? Why not spend this time on interacting with opponent in fighting over map control or harrassing? Isn't it more fun?
Apm spent on fighting against interface in my opinion is less interesting than fighting against an opponent.

At 190 pounds you should have been expending roughly 2500 calories to maintain your weight if you exercised at least a few times per week. Leaving you with only around 300 calories that you could eat without gaining weight.  Let just say you exercised every day that leaves you burning around 3000 calories a day meaning you would have 800 calories left to eat after all the pop.

The dictionary.

Because it wasn't intended.  It just happened.  It seems your definition of god is *more* than just the cosmos, which brings me back to the belief in dragons/free will problem.  There's as much evidence for an intention to our existence as there is for world-destroying dragons.

Which we are.

Dear police officers, when you see your fellow officers doing stuff like this and back up their stories, lie to get them out of trouble or even look the other way raising your hands and screaming ""NOT ALL COPS!"", you are part of the problem. In fact, you are the reason these things keep happening because you don't do what you're supposed to do, which is bring criminals to justice and keep the people safe. 

Where the **fuck** are the good cops when black people are murdered for traffic violations? Where the fuck are the good cops when the bad cops break the law to get what they want? Doesn't it make you mad? Doesn't it make you upset that your job is being ridiculed because of ""some bad apples""? Don't you want to help people? How the fuck do these cops keep getting away with essentially murder if they're the minority and most cops are good? Can someone fucking explain this to me please because i'm at my wit's end with this bullshit. 

You have become criminals with a badge. People do not respect you, they fear and hate you because of your constant abuse of power and your them vs us mentality. You put the lives of your bad apples above the lives of the people you are supposed to protect. You work *for* the people, not the other way around.

Basically, with hyper advanced space faring societies you sometimes get wreckage fields in space that need to be cleaned up. A 'Space Whale' was a massive autonomous salvage ship that would drift amongst these wreckage fields 'eating' garbage.

The fun stuff happened when the rudimentary AI that governed these whales would get confused and would start actively scanning for ships that had life signs on board and eat them instead of the lifeless garbage. These ships were called 'Space Sharks' and they were terrifying.

"russia","t5_2qh75","I perfectly understand how (and why) they use it. It's a cheap way to libel and smear an individual in many people's minds without technically breaking any rules. FOX News has been caught doing this over and over, along with the ""question mark statement"" smear technique - it's not libel if you put your smear in the form of a question! Examples:

""Is Obama's birth certificate faked?""
The content of the article doesn't matter. The headline already does its damage by legitimizing the question in the first place.

""Obama's birth certificate 'might be fake', the council hears"" 
You read the article and they are talking about some Bumfuck, Kentucky city council, hearing the ravings of a local militia leader.

The thing is, when people read headlines, they tend to catch only certain ""key words"" and miss things like quotation and punctuation. Plus, as I said, most people won't even read about something that doesn't directly concern them past the headline. It's what propaganda like this counts on.","1438387977"

The replica sails just as fast as the original, even with the horribly planned and executed modern standard they decided the 2012 refit had to meet (this is the issue actually not the whole ship itself but rather the standard it was made to meet). I spent some time with the crew last weekend whole out for a sail and as someone who built his own boats before (one 25' sailboat and one 15' rowboat) I had some questions. It can sail quite well even at low speeds (2 knots) and can tack into the wind at those low speeds and can attain the speeds the original did if not actually exceed them. However you will never see the replica ever race nor has it ever raced since the major backer of the original 1963 replica (the former captain and Oland family) ensure that this ship comes with the stipulation that it never be allowed to race in competitions in order to preserve the legacy of the original. 

This replica was always and remains always as a tribute to the original and serves its function, as I mentioned previously, as an ambassador for tourism for the country and province.  ","1438387978"

"AgainstGamerGate","t5_3441a","&gt; Sort of. I don't hand that power to my detractors. The media does.

And you could take that power *right* back by having a clearly defined manifesto, leaders, set long-term and short-term goals, establish a structure of hierarchy and responsibility. If Gamergate did this, then everyone else would *have* to meet them *on their terms*  But they refuse to, so the media, your detractors, myself and everyone else just gets to run wild because they have no ability to tell us otherwise.  Establish that ability for yourself, and you take that power away.  

&gt;   The Tea Party, OWS, GG, the MRM, even today's Feminism, are all moving away from the idea of central leadership, and toward a more group-oriented methodology. 

And how well has that gone for them?  The Tea Party has been hijacked by the loudest, craziest voices because they refused to corral themselves.  Occupy Wallstreet ate itself alive because it couldn't give a single answer about what colour the sky was. And Gamergate can't even answer the question ""Gamergate is about ____"" in the span of an allotted 15 minute speaking time without loosing its goddamned mind.  

Maanwhile, look at successful movements like the African American Civil Rights movement:  Leaders, goals, rules, organization, structure, long-term plans, condemnation of dissident and actions which went against their ideology.  Every single thing that Gamergate ardently refuses to consider.

I shouldn't have to point out to GG that modeling themselves after movements that failed explicitly to their organizational structure, is not an advisable move, yet here we are.  

For the record, I had the highest hopes in the world that OWS would make some change in this country.  They could have BEEN something.  But they opted to be a bunch of random hippies in drum circles with no leaders, no goals, no road-map, a list of grievances thirty miles long with nary a single thought put forward on how to address them.

And you know what happened?  Their opposition that was structured, organized, and methodical, swept them aside like yesterday's trash.  Imagine that...","1438387978"

Plus, you can actually resist or parry their puch if you are in contact for more than the instant it hits your face. Having your hands out a bit cuts down their angle, like a goalie coming forward to block a shot. 

Having your hands 6-12 inches from your face does give up actually covering that specific bit of your face, but if they're up and positioned between their body and your face it's worth the tradeoff to have a good chance to defend all of your head instead of just your chin. Also, you should be standing out of reach so one of you has to step to start throwing useful punches, which gives you a moment to react.","1438387983"
"ABraThatFits","t5_2s8kf","Universities are not a good estimate of the general population. Universities pretty much only have 18-22 year old undergrads, plus a smaller number of 23-26 year old grad students. Also, the vast majority of women who have the academic qualifications, the financial funding, and the motivation to go to university are from the upper class or upper middle class. At least in countries like the United States, the higher your social class the thinner you are. Part of it is cause lower income people often can't afford to buy all their groceries at Whole Foods. Part of it is that there is relatively more fat-shaming among the elite than among the lower class.

The independent lingerie store sorta near me is located in a zip code where there are tons of very young women and very affluent and educated women. Thus, they sell just as many 30 bands as they do 36 bands, and just as many 28 bands as they do 38 bands. I know of another independent lingerie store far away from me who publish their customer demographics, and at that store hardly anyone needs a 30 or 28 band. They are located in an area where most of the women are over 30 and less affluent.","1438387983"

I think Baccano's narrative is fairly ""unique"" and is certainly engaging if nothing else, so that's good. I don't remember the music being anything special besides the OP, but I remember enjoying the voice acting (yes I watched it subbed, sue me) a *lot.*

No secret that I prefer BB's first season of OreGairu to Feel's Zoku. Although Feel's *looks* better on the surface, I quite like the simplicity of BB's art style and I think ""more is less"" certainly applied to OreGairu. Not to mention there were a lot of comic facial expressions that could only be done with Brains Base's rougher animation. 

Aoharu x Machinegun is absolutely nothing special, but I think it's a pretty fun series. Another series with really good voice acting, I guess I really don't have too much else to say about it yet.

Anyways, we all remained close and are friends now and she's coming to my wedding.

She became very close with her college roommate and shortly after started dating a new guy for a couple years.

"Justrolledintotheshop","t5_2tteh","I can't provide you the file for proof because it contains personal info. Back in 2000 (well before my time), a person was flying in our flying club. He joined just a week before and flew up to either Wisconsin or Minnesota for some meeting. On the way back, there was weather and he chose to fly in it anyways, even though he wasn't instrument rated (thus, broke regulation by flying into weather). He hit a strong embedded thunderstorm (which was all over the ATC radar), which tore the wings off and killed him and his 3 passengers. Our insurance settled for the full policy payout. EDIT: I can provide the NTSB report: http://www.ntsb.gov/_layouts/ntsb.aviation/GeneratePDF.aspx?id=CHI99FA290&amp;rpt=fa

There's also [cleveland vs piper aircraft](http://airportnoiselaw.org/cases/piper-1.html). This case led to piper becoming bankrupt, the GA production shutdown in the 80's, and cessna stopped producing small aircraft until the passing of [GARA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Aviation_Revitalization_Act).

Liability is fucking RIDICULOUS in aviation. I'm involved in an upcoming lawsuit because I helped a couple friends look at an aircraft. I found numerous problems, but overall they were relatively minor. I couldn't do a full and complete inspection and told everyone that I need a couple days to even come close to doing a proper and thorough inspection, especially since I am not familiar with that aircraft. I told them from the beginning that I don't know that aircraft, but I'll see what I can find, and to make sure they hire someone competent to do the annual inspection. They hired the guy who had worked on the plane for the past 15 years. Turns out he wasn't competent at all. Numerous other issues were found which were estimated to be $70,000 in repairs, but the plane was purchased for $50,000. The lawyers are hired and the lawsuits are flying, but that mechanic is trying to implicate me, saying ""They had some friend of theirs come and look at the plane, and he said it was fine"".

"MGTOW","t5_2sjgc","Here goes.  My sister is this person.  When I say something innocent like ""Carrie Fisher is the only one from the original star wars that didn't have a career post-film"" she replies with ""yeah, its hard to be a woman in hollywood"".  WTF?!  My sister is a really smart girl, the problem is she doesn't have much in the way of intellectual curiosity, she doesn't want to know.  

How do you discuss what you think with someone like that?  There's an easy answer: you don't.  There are two kinds of people in this world: those who follow the crowd, and those who make up their mind on something approaching evidence (we all have biases, so nothing is completely evidenced-based, but there are people who will change their minds if you give them good data).  My sister, much as it pains me to say it, follows the crowd.  I've posted on this elsewhere on this forum.  

When I was in school, I spent twelve years (grade 1 through senior year of HS) in school with people who were far right wing conservatives.  The Kind of people who vote for Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.  All through those twelve years, despite people constantly trying to talk to me, I remained a hard liberal.  When I was 18, I voted straight ticket democrat.  I don't follow what other people say just because they say it (it would have made my social life at school easier).  I didn't start voting GOP until I was twenty years old and I was living in Berkeley.  The city is a hell-hole, and the furthest left city council in the US.  It was there when I first thought ""you know, Berkeley is a far left utopia, and the city is shit, maybe the left's answers aren't so good after all"".  That's when I first started asking questions.  

In that way, at least, I know the anger phase very well.  When I got to college, I realized that everything I'd been taught since I was in first grade, everything my friends and the people in my life had told me, was a lie, and that I needed to figure stuff out fast.  People think the lie is helping you, that its good for kids to believe in Santa Claus.  Its not, its better to give kids the tools to deal with reality, and disappointment, as fast as possible.  Parents don't give kids that anymore.  Parents sell girls on the Princess fairy-tale, and don't tell them what to do when they wake up in a hotel room at 3 AM, completely plastered, they'd had a drunk gang bang with ten dudes the night before (all of whom left as soon as they were done), she doesn't remember any of their names, and she didn't use any protection.  Some subset of girls in this world will go through that, or even worse, they aren't taught how to deal with it or how to avoid it.  Its just ""men are evil, and you're a special snowflake, m'kay?""  

My answer to your situation in particular would be two-fold:

A) when you realize there is no female love, only female respect, the entire world grows cold, and you grow angry.  It happened to me.  When I learned it, I wanted to huddle up into a ball and cry.  I didn't want to be alone forever.  Man doesn't want to be alone.  That's the entire illusion of the blue pill, and why so many don't want to give it up, they don't want to give up the illusion that they aren't alone.  They will fight you to the death to keep the illusion.  Its what gives women their power.  Even in the book of Genesis, one of the first things God realized, after he created man, was that man was unhappy alone, so he made woman.  Its ingrained into us to desire that which we can never have.  We will lie to ourselves, deceive others, beg and steal to make it not true.  

B) that's how I deal with my sister.  I understand she can't love me.  I don't expect her to, anymore than I expect an elephant to fly.  Once you get past the anger phase, its liberating.  You understand why craving female attention is pointless: it will never make them love you.  They all want something from you, the big ones are resources and validation.  Even horrifically ugly women get likes when they upload pictures to facebook.  Moderately attractive women get 400+ likes in record time on facebook.  

That's why girls send naked selfies, and then freak out when it gets out.  They do it for peer validation.  If you withhold validation from a girl, its like withholding crack from addict: the desire for validation only gets stronger the more you withhold it.  BP men have it all wrong, the way to get in a girls panties is not to compliment her or like her photos, its to withhold validation from her when she's desperately seeking it.  You do the math: everyone in the universe loves her, gives her ""special snowflake"" status.  One guy doesn't care what she thinks or feels.  Which man is the high value man?  

If you're in your early 20's and broke, my advice to you would be don't give in to despair.  You're not even close to your peak years yet.  You've got a decade of life left till you hit your sexual peak years and peak earning years.  The point of your 20's is to get through them.  Focus on your career, focus on building your value.  Hope this helps, let us know how you get on, as I'd like to hear how you do.","1438387994"

This is because larva inject combined with units that are cost-effective vs mech and protoss at 200/200 would make zerg unbeatable in the mid-game. So throughout SC2, zerg balance has always either been ""kill them before they get a deathball"" or ""use free units to kill the deathball"". Any time larva units have been cost-effective, like the original ravager or the 2 armor 1 supply roaches, they get promptly nerfed.

Now that we know how Parkour 2.0 works changes will be made accordingly I still feel like their should be speed and distance added to the new slide jump because it is so slow.

If so, I also recommend either a few portable dimmer packs (ETC sensor racks for instance) or a less mobile rack that you connect your raceways too. As for connectors, that's up to you really. If you have power up high where you're hanging these or drawing from the dimmer racks, then stick with whatever is on the light.

There's all sorts of comparison sites and bench mark sites to give you a better understanding of how each card will perform in the various situations you would want it to run in.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;The point of this argument, though, is not that we are ""wholly determined"" by these systems, therefore condemned to complicity, but rather that these processes, precisely as social - language as its carrier - are generalized, impersonal, and internalized

You should read into affect theory (the Politics of Affect by Brian Massumi comes to mind, but definitely don't start with this one if you've never read this topic before).

But yes, I agree that it shouldn't be taken as a personal attack and that this halts productive discourse. As well I argue that by belonging to this society we are never really *not* racist (or more specifically that giving white people more ways to pat themselves on the back for supposedly not participating in these systems is not helpful). For Massumi, the way to move forward is to practice resistance, and to imagine new ways of movement through these systems rather than resort to utopian ideas of simply leaving the system (which he argues lead to hopelessness).","1438388003"

In my experience this is a common thing with new game groups and especially all new gamers with an all new GM. They're finding their feet and that's normal. Remember that the player is invested in their character. If you spring a sudden trap that kills them, just 'because', it is the same as a player suddenly acquiring a weapon that instantly annihilates your entire carefully thought out and pre-planned campaign setting. 

As your group come to realise that you won't do this, and that character deaths will only occur if they mess up or rules determine the character dies in combat or as the result of spectacular roll failures, they'll stop pussy-footing and things will move along more smoothly and quickly.","1438388005"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","&gt;The Quran commands Muslims not to divide amongst themselves, and killing of people who even just claim to be Muslim, including new converts who probably comitted sin in their lives, is shown to be a great error in the Seerah.

 1. I rather doubt it does
 
 2. Even if it did, I'm sure every branch/sect of Islam thinks they aren't the ones who split, but the others did and they're the apostates/infidels. That's what the conflict is about after all.

 3. The Quran also says a great deal about what to do about apostates and unbelievers and gays and so on. Who is going to arbitrate that question? You? What made you an authority?

 4. As if I care what the Quran says, why should I care? Why should any non-Muslim care? Why are ANY of us non-Muslims obligated to give any kind of shit about what the Quran says? ...Surely the ones who should care and receive your notation about what the Quran says, are Muslims..

&gt;Which part of the Quran are ISIS following, by killing shia Muslims?

That conflict has been going on for 1,400 years (that's one THOUSAND and four HUNDRED years mate). Why are you asking me? There is a metric fuckton of information about why, how, where, when etc. It is a conflict ENTIRELY based in religion and every source says so. All it takes is a single google search.

I ask **again**: How many members of ISIS are Shiite and how many Sunni holy sites were blown up by ISIS?

&gt;I can quote you verses that they are disobeying by doing so. The fact still remains, a person's religion doesn't decide the innocence of a person, and ISIS don't make the rules for Islam.

Says you. When did you become the authority on these matters? They (ISIS) can quote verses/Surahs too and they do. What makes their citations and quotations worse than yours? What makes them less right? Who is going to arbitrate this question? You? What give you the authority? Or is it well known, highly regarded scholars who say these things? Oh well pardon me..same question to them then..What makes them the authority? What about the scholars who disagree with your scholars and agree with ISIS? What makes them an authority?

&gt;Killing a person just because you believe they aren;t a Muslim when they claim to be is a massive sin. 

Says you. No doubt you're going to quote part of the Quran at me to underline your point, but you're forgetting something, I'm not the one killing people in the name of Islam. Go and object to ISIS, because they disagree with you about this being a massive sin. They're the ones citing verses and so on, justifying their actions, not me..

&gt; The fact that I don't entertain the same resentments some Muslims have for differing sects doesn't mean I don't take the situation seriously. Rather, it's because I'm serious that...

Sorry to say, but it doesn't seem like you are. You seem like a nice and indeed accommodating person. But as long as you're playing ""No True Scotsman"" with me, instead of facing reality, I'm afraid it doesn't at all seem serious. It just seems like a soft whine to protect religious sensibilities and feelings. People are dying..dying mate..on the grounds of other people's religious conviction and you can sit there all day, saying to me they're not proper Muslims..it won't make any difference..ISIS will still cite the Quran and the Hadith and maim, torture and kill everyone they see fit, because their religion justifies it. The same is true for any Sunni and Shiite confrontation...

What do you think ISIS will say, pretending for a moment that you wouldn't be killed and you had a pedestal to address them collectively, if you tell them that they're not Islamic and that various Islamic surahs makes what they're doing, a massive sin? Honestly? ...It might not be *your* idea of Islam, but it is *their* idea of Islam. 

&gt;A lot of blood has been shed due to religion. I'm not ignorant to that, nor am I ignorant to the truth that Human Behaviour =/= Religous Doctrine. The Bible doesn't command predominant branches of Christianity to snuff out other Christians. 

Yes it does, are you kidding me? It's why the 100 years war happened, it's why schisms happen, it's why people fled to Holland during the early days due to religious oppression, it's why letters were sent to Jefferson to ask for help against religious oppression (The Congregationalists were oppressing the Baptists..go figure)..it's why there were witch hunts and the term ""pagan"" and the inquisition and on and on it goes...All of it, supported by Christianity and their wonderful Catholic figurehead ""the pope"" (actually there are several popes for multiple versions of Christianity, but never mind all that)..and you know what? It bothers me that I have to know all these things, in order to counter claims like yours..I don't want to know all these things, but every damn time I'm forced to go look up historical facts, read holy scripture and study all manner of religious detail because I actually care about getting stuff right...Which then further annoys me, because I then realize that I'm faced with people, making arguments like yours, who clearly didn't care and are just repeating religious apologetics..In short, I wasted my time.

&gt;People do that to eachother. And funnily enough, religions actually forbid it! 

This is the sort of thing I mean. That is quite clearly and obviously not true *at all* ..It would take me less than 5 minutes to pull up a mountain of citations and quotes etc. that explicitly calls for death, violence, torture, slavery and so on..and I've had to do this, for several years now, to the sound of various excuses (""out of context"", ""not literally"", ""you haven't understood it"", ""scholars disagree"", ""wrong translation"", ""contradictions"" (yeah contradiction is another big problem of holy scripture, as if to help me make my point) etc. etc), as if I care...It's what the texts *literally* say and encourage. Now you want to sit there and claim that this has nothing to do whatsoever with people then acting on these things, citing them as justification and claiming divine warrant and then doing *exactly* the things that the texts say...I'm sorry you're going to have to do a *lot* better than that.

Now do people do horrible things without religion? Of course..and I'm under no illusion that in a lot of cases, that it's *just* religion..no it usually comes packaged with politics as well, of course it does. But see how easily people find justification for their shitty politics when religion gets involved? I know I do..Religion has a way of making bad things a *lot* worse. So to say ""without religion people would still be doing bad things"", is just not good enough I'm afraid, it's a very *very* bad excuse and I think you insult your own intelligence for suggesting it.

I get what you're saying, but that isn't really what is being discussed.

I see the incarceration nation as the product of big government. We have so many laws on the books, and ""tough on crime"" plays so well in the sticks, that we end up creating a prison system that is unmanageably large. I dare say that 50% of the prison population probably doesn't need to be there. We send too many people in the first place, and sentences keep getting longer. 

*Less* government intrusion into people's lives, and *fewer* laws about things with no clear direct victim would do much to help the issue.

But yes, in prisons themselves, there needs to be more government intervention. You can't just take a bunch of violent, hopeless people and lock them up in a building and ignore them.

It's not so much about *more* government; it's about using government resources better. ","1438388011"

"crossfit","t5_2qqfd","TL;DR all the replies, apologies if any of this was said in another post!

Paleo is essentially focused around the food choices you make, and can be applied to any other ""diet plan"" you choose - macros, zone, carb cycling, etc.

I did zone paleo (as they discuss in L1) for several months last year, leaned out real quick, but in hindsight my performance absolutely suffered.  I ended up eating a lot of fat, probably because im lean already and they recommend increasing fat intake once you drop below a certain BF%.

Now I mostly count my macros, but still eat paleo ~80/20, in the same fashion as others, i.e. dense starches after workouts, vegetables/fruit the rest of the day.  Try to hit my protein and fat numbers everyday, and dont worry too much if i eat less carbs on days i dont work out, or more on days i do.  

In response to your last 2 points, i cant imagine it even being possible to meet your goals without cooking at home and bringing to work, and yes, food is almost entirely responsible for both performance and body composition.

So why was the defense seemingly improved? Maybe turnovers, maybe the fact that the run game was able to take TOP away from the other team. Philly now probably has the most loaded backfield in the league, which could help mask their weaknesses, in addition to two great acquisitions in Maxwell and Alonso.","1438388013"

Funny you should say that.  Because that's pretty much what DID is, except that ""five-year-old-you"" is a distinct personality.

Then 10 minutes later ""you"" come back, not knowing what happened, feeling like you just blacked out... sort of in a fog... 

What happens with people who have DID is the different ""parts"" of a person split.  The wiring in the brain no longer connects these ""parts"", so each part develops on its own.

"TheLastAirbender","t5_2rybx","Yes, but keep your expectations reasonable. Even though they are set in the same universes, the two shows have completely different methods of storytelling. In fact, I would say that each book of LOK feels more like an individual six hour long movie than seasons of a TV show. 

The main differences are that LOK has a more modern-ish setting. (Based around the 1930's), and has more mature themes. The villains are less black and white, and each one represents a different real-world government ideology at its worst. (Communism, Theocracy, Monarchy, Anarchy, and Fascism) LOK's main plots are much faster paced and to me more addicting, but this change does come at the expense of some character development.

However, the shows often pop up on Netflix's popular/trending lists, so it's also true that classic style ST is *still* mega-popular. People mention the shows (sometimes one of the old movies too) all the time too, despite every single one being old reruns with dated CGI. I doubt the Jimmy Jammy versions will have staying power for decades, since those movies have weaker plots/characters, IMO. Basically in 10 years I see more people watching 'Wrath of Kahn', TNG etc. relative to 'In to Darkness'.

I think his Star Wars movies will be better though, helps when the director actually likes the current project and isn't daydreaming about his next job. I bet that happened with those particular movies,","1438388021"

We've all heard about Datto, Replibit, Chartec, etc not holding up their end of the deal, not being able to mount restores, costing way too much, etc. That sucks. But this question is only being asked because it seems like all the BDR players suck. This question isn't being asked about the backup software itself, or any other parts of the stack. No one is asking ""Why do you use StorageCraft instead of rolling your own backup scripts and VM replication system?""

You could run this question the whole way up the stack and back down. Why do you use someone else's colo space if you can build your own? Why do you use someone else's email server if you can run your own? Why do you use someone else's RMM tool if you can roll your own? Why do you use someone else's OS if you can code your own? Why do you use someone else's PCs if you can build your own? If we're asking about BDRs, we can ask about every other piece of the stack.

At some point, in any business or even just life in general, you decide where to draw that line between what you'll do for yourself and what you'll pay someone else to do (outsource). I'm too busy to run my own email servers for 100+ mailboxes and I'm too busy to grow my own food. I need both of those things, though, so I've decided that to outsource those tasks.

As for Singapore, one you factor in the tax hiding it's still pretty low tax, sure. But that's basically because it's super easy to administer a state when it's the size of a large city.

"Morrowind","t5_2r9nv","Ok so I got two mods just now.

First one is Great House Dagoth, which is one of the two popular Sixth House mods I read up about, only this is the more lore friendly version.
http://mw.modhistory.com/download-33-8052

I also got a mod that adds dialogue and immersion to it called The Tribe Unmourned http://mw.modhistory.com/download-4-13139

Although I don't really like the idea of Tribe Unmourned because of this reason: ""- New Voices  
Added around five soundsets spread across ash ghouls, ascended sleepers and vampires.  ""

I REALLY hope this means that I'm not going to hear God-awful horrible voice acting with terrible mic quality.

I'm not sure exactly why I'm so opposed to the idea of voice acted mods. Most experiences I've had with them are just terrible. I guess that's also why I am kinda opposed to getting a mod as big as the Sixth House one too, I'm just scared of being underwhelmed. 


Oh well life's not without trying new things.

On a side note, I'm excited as Hell for this playthrough! I'll be playing with the Journal Mod again http://www.reddit.com/r/Morrowind/comments/32uzon/itt_things_you_do_to_have_fun_in_morrowindjournal/ only this time I'll use it from the beginning of the character.

I'm thinking I'll have a slightly egotistical Dark Elf mage(or another race. I dunno. Are Dark Elves good mages?) who is opposed to the Sixth House but slowly goes kinda mad and corrupted and joins them. He's kinda evil from the beginning. Then again, I kinda think the Sixth House isn't all entirely evil. They just want to purge the land of non-Dark Elves. What's wrong with a little race war? :3


Anyways I'll leave this thread up for a few hours before I start my playthrough, incase there is a better set of mods than the two I posted.","1438388027"

"Swingers","t5_2qyei","We started swinging at clubs but now virtually all of our swinging contacts now are at private parties which we either host or our friends do. Sometimes we take up several rooms at a resort as well, but most in someones home. They are like any party straight people have but, of course, there's the sex.

So this is the key point, these are friends, mostly people we know. I don't know of anyone who would open their home up to strangers, like just put out some open invite and not have any idea who might show up. Parties we attend (or host) are with people we know. 

Now, it is not unusual for invited friends to ask the host if they can bring a new couple into the party group. We trust that people we know will vet the new person and would not ask to include them if our friends were not ready to vouch for them. On rare occasion, the new couple doesn't jive with the group and doesn't get a second invitation, but mostly this has been a great way to introduce new couples to the party group.

So to your question, how do you get invited to parties? It all has to do with the number of friends you have made in swinging. Most of our friends know each other having met on SLS or other meetings. If you know some people you think might get along, and you are comfortable having them in your home, host your own party. 

As I say, the way you make these connections is similar to how you would for non-swinging events. ","1438388029"

Also, my partner and I are socially exclusive - we don't have relationships outside of ours, and we don't use condoms between us. We're sexually non-monogamous though. Seems like that's what she assumed you two had and you didn't steer her any different.

When? If you meant the world terraformer, Clark was the only one fast enough to get to the Indian ocean. The one in Metropolis was supposed to be destroyed by the military, which they did accomplish, but ultimately screwed up on. And if you mean the fight with Zod, well here is the thing, Clark has been doing this for, what, a few days? He doesn't have the experience to save everyone and move everyone out of the way, he doesn't have the strength to hold down a raging Zod (who also destroyed most of the buildings in the fight), and doesn't even have a special prison or some magical green rock at his disposal.  He was just basically forced into this thing whether he wanted it or not.

&gt; just like Zod.

And here's the salt maker of the film. The Zod scene. Again, there was nothing that could stop Zod. No prison, no kryptonite, no red sun radiation, nothing. Either he kills Zod, or the entire planet is in danger of getting destroyed by a raging Kryptonian who doesn't care for humans as we don't care for a pile of ants. ","1438388033"

&gt;It changes the correctness of your claim. 

They want a caliphate, they've said so. They justify their actions through the Quran and the Hadith, they've said so..they've cited Surah after Surah, claimed holy warrant for their actions. Now is there an element of politics? Of course there is..A caliphate *is* a political matter, but it's religious politics..They think, that if only they can attract enough people to the Dar Al Harb (the house of war), they can re-establish something like the Ottoman Empire and everything will be brilliant...All of this is based on religion. This is what drives them and so I don't see your point at all.

&gt;The situation of that area really has plumetted from a great height. The Islamic empire originated in that area of the world. The Muslims brought down super powers in their early days, and reached a golden era some centuries later with Islam at their heart.

Yes and the Roman Empire was rather magnificent too, which had Christianity at it's heart..but I can't begin to tell you how much I don't care. That it was maybe great back then, doesn't mean it is now, nor that it should even be attempted..in fact, it's quite clear to me that it shouldn't, because by today's standard, both were barbaric and I don't want that. 

&gt;The caliphate was going strong, but tumbled quite spectacularly - the remnants of which were turned against eachother by promises of power from the West..

Yeah, during the 100 years war, the Ottoman Empire sided with Germany..big mistake, oh well, mistakes happen. That isn't ""The west"", that's just one country which was part of the west - so what? How long ago was this? And why should anyone care? What on *earth* are we doing, trying to whine and revive grievances hundreds upon hundreds of years old? I mean using this mode of thinking I could bring up a huge number of grievances with other western countries relative to my own country, oh and eastern countries too, but I don't; you know why? Because this is 2015 and I have better things to do than sit around and feel sorry, that the world isn't as ideal for my country/people as it used to be. 

&gt; but plenty of athiests are sick with power too..

Of course, but that has nothing to do with atheism. Being an atheist just means you aren't religious..it doesn't necessarily make you a better person, especially not if you're already pretty shit. Atheism doesn't come with a book, or instructions, or anything you must subscribe to..All it means, is that you aren't buying what religious people are selling, that's it...after that you could very well be a sadist, or nihilist, or a fascist.

&gt; Just who has all this power exactly? Anyway If Muhammad (PBUH) wanted power, Islam would not exist.

But he did get power. That's *exactly* what he got ..I mean just look at what happened when the problem of succession came about. Look at what that has done alone up until this day. He wanted power, that's why he was a conquering warlord..So you got that backwards.

&gt;Though in correct Islamic conduct a person can't just force himself upon the world as an unwanted leader..

Lets make a deal, you help people like Maajid Nawaz make a reality out of an Islamic revolution and speak in tones like he does, and I'll be happy to see that kind of Islam flourish, in fact I'll help if I can. But ""staying home"" isn't the right thing to do ..If it's the Islamic thing to do, then Islam is wrong, simple as that.

&gt;You must have had a very limited experience with religious people then.

No I've had quite a lot of experience. Far more than I'd like to be honest, but hey, that's life. You deal with whatever comes your way. Now I'm a little disappointed to hear what sounds like a ""not all religious people"" argument..because if I had meant ""all"" religious people, I would have used the word ""all"" when saying ""Religious people seek power""..The sentence would have been ""All religious people seek power"", but it wasn't, so if you don't mind.

&gt;quite frankly if I didn't care about the afterlife then I'd be putting that effort and time to different use.

I wish you wouldn't care about the afterlife to be honest..I wish you could care about reality, as though this was your one and only experience of it. I wish you would treat life, as though it was a one-shot deal, where you had to make the most of it now...where every meeting and interaction is potential friendship, platonic love and companionship and learning and a chance to marvel at reality, explore it, together...and that's why I'm so annoyed with this subject, because it's disrupting my chances to do these things, it's wasting my time and yet I'm forced to deal with it (and I don't want to, believe me..I *really* don't) because it imposes itself on my life and the lives of others.

You want me to understand you and your point of view and I've put effort, unreasonable amounts of efforts, into doing that. Now will you afford me the same? Will you try to understand the sort of misery I suffer because of all this? Someone like me, who is unable to be religious. Will you?

I didn't do much besides rank them roughly in order of accessibility but if someone finds them helpful I'll be happy. He said he liked Doggystyle and Bizzare Ride 2 The Pharcyde so I grouped them wrt to those. Oh yeah sadly I've only heard about 2/3rd's of the albums on that list.


**Endtroducing**Doesn't fit into any of the categories but a brilliant album just listen to it.

**Doggystyle (G-Funk, Dre influence, Gangsta rap)**

Dr. Dre - 2001 (Best mixed Hip-Hop album ever)

2Pac - All Eyez On Me (Some people say it has too much filler but honestly I think it has 1 filler song, possible GOAT album, biggest contender against 2001 for best mixed album)

Dr.Dre - The Chronic (Made G-Funk a mainstream thing and possibly invented it (it's disputed))

The Game - The Documentary (Dre production)

The Dogg Pound - Dogg Food

DJ Quik - Rhythm-al-ism (Safe + Sound is just as good but all his albums are good)

Warren G - Regulate - G-Funk Era

2Pac - Me Against The World/The 7 Day Theory (It's hard to compare these 2 just listen)

N.W.A - Straight Outta Compton (You have to at least heard the title track!)

N.W.A (Minus Ice Cube) - Niggaz 4 Life (http://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.2951/title.efil4zaggin-n-w-a-s-4gotten-masterpiece Article written by big /r/hhh contributer Mikeaveli)

Suga Free - Street Gospel (From the Bay but DJ Quik production)

DJ Quik - Quik Is The Name (G-Funk sounding a year before Dre.)

Ice Cube - Amerikkka's Most Wanted/The Predator/Death Certificate (Hard to rate as well but probably in that order. Check out Lethal Injection too. If you like Public Enemy you'll like these)

Above The Law - Livin' Like Hustlers (Lot's of great beats and varied topics. 187um is the 3rd possible originator of G-Funk along with Quik and Dre. Black Mafia Life and Uncle Sams Curse are great too.)

Westside Connection - Bow Down

Strictly 4 My Niggaz (At least heat Keep Ya Head Up &amp; I Get Around)

Xzibit - Restless (I'd put At The Speed Of Life above it)

Ice-T - O.G Original Gangster

Snoop Dogg - No Limit Top Dogg

MC Eiht (The G ain't in him) - We Come Strapped (I've only given it one listen but didn't like it. Music to Driveby is much better and more accessible.)

**Bay Area/Mobb Music/Hyphy**

Mac Dre - Ronald Dregan: Dreganomics

E-40 - My Ghetto Report Card (Check the first 5 songs if you don't like them you probably won't like the rest, but most people do.)

E-40 - In A Major Way (Check out Tha Hall of Game next but he has lots of great albums)

The Luniz - Operation Stackola (I Got 5 On It is timeless)

Mac Mall - Illegal Business (Check out Untouchable too which has a [great album cover](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/bf/Mac_Mall_-_Untouchable.jpg))

Richie Rich - Seasoned Veteran (One of my favourites. Half Thang is good too)

Spice 1 - 187 He Wrote (Spice 1 the album is great too)

Andre Nickitina (Dre Dog) - I Hate You With A Passion (Another [animal related album cover](http://darkmp3.ru/imgs/8130929-460x460/i-hate-you-with-a-passion.jpg))

Sex Packets (Actually really accessible but the others are better)

**Bizzare Ride (Alternative Hip-Hop, boom bap)** These are all really easy to get into. Make sure to check out The Pharcyde's next album Labincalifornia too.

Deltron 3030 (Actually quite a unique album but /r/music loves it so I'd say it's very accessible)

Souls Of Mischief - '93 Till Infinity (Title track is brilliant)

Jurrasic 5 - Quality Control 

Casual - Fear Itself ([Biggie rapped](https://youtu.be/1njR8DgS3tg) over the ""I Didn't Mean Too"" beat)

The Coup - Genocide &amp; Juice (Steal This Double Album is brilliant too &amp; less explicitly political)

Hieroglyphics - 3rd Eye Vision (Del, Causal &amp; Souls Of Mischief in a group so your coming full circle)","1438388037"

On a side note, I was just at the Uniqlo flagship store in NYC when on vacation, and they have a whole hallway just lined with every sort of down jacket you can think of. If it were 15 degrees cooler outside at the time I probably would have bought one just because it was super cool.","1438388037"
"climatechange","t5_2rawx","The subject is still very much in debate. Anyone who tells you the science is settled is lying to you.

The consensus of 97% is posed as such; 97% of scientists believes humans have some impact on the climate.  This does not say how much or the warming, nor if it is bad or not.

In reality, the 97% is a consensus of 41 papers out of the 12,465 papers in the widely cited cook et al study. I highly recommend you read it for yourself(it's short).

http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/2/024024/article

From the data presented.



    Endorse AGW         32.6% (3896) 	 	

    No AGW position 	66.4% (7930) 

    Reject AGW 	        0.7% (78) 

    Uncertain on AGW 	0.3% (40)

As you can see, of the 12,000+ papers, only 32.6% mention AGW at all, and of those(when independently verified), only 41 endorse the IPCC ""consensus"". http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11191-013-9647-9

&gt;However, inspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic


A different study that explicitly asked how much of the warming was caused by humans, and the results are that 47% of scientists agree that humans are causing over 50% of the warming.

I could ask the question in reverse; why do you hoard 800 weapon parts exactly?



And, I just did some quick math for you.. There are 9 weapons types in Destiny (Hand Cannons, Pulse Rifles, Scout Rifles, Auto Rifles, sniper Rifles, Shotguns, Fusion Rifles, Rocket Launchers, Heavy Machine Guns). It ""cost"" 3 weapon parts for 1 reroll.

Lets say that you'd like to reroll one decent gun of each types. Your stockpile of 800 parts will let you reroll one of each 30 times.

But in reality, you wont really do that. No, because for 5 of these weapons types, they actually comes in 3 differents elements [void, solar, arc].

So, ni reality, if you really want one of each, you'll end up being able to try and reroll each 19 times.

Oh, and in reality, most of these weapons types have some perks that are great in PVP, but not in PvE.

So, if you'd also like one of each of these (elements arent important here, so 9 weapons type only), you'll ONLY be able to reroll each one 11 times.

and as anybody who's done it a lot can tell you, you wont get far with 11 rerolls.","1438388040"

"nutrition","t5_2qoox","I was all ready to put up my dukes and defend fruit but it looks like everyone here is a fan of common sense and scientific consensus. 

The truth is that every single health problem that is attributed to sugar intake, whether it is diabetes, obesity, CVD, cancer, etc has actually been show to be protected against by fruit of all kinds. Not just a little bit here and there as part of a ""well-rounded balanced diet"", but actually large amounts of fruit every day is very very good for you. 

An awesome video by Dr. Gregor http://nutritionfacts.org/video/if-fructose-is-bad-what-about-fruit/

One other thought, sometimes people compare the sugar in fruit as ""just as bad as refined"" but having some extra fiber, nutrients etc. Maybe sugar itself gets a bad rep since we've learned to refine it. Maybe the sugar that's in fruits and vegetables is actually a great source of energy and fuel and actually helps the nutrients be absorbed properly by raising insulin and allowing the nutrient uptake to occur readily.

Actually there was an amazing character on Holby City (yeah I know it's not sci-fi) called Chantelle. She was the classic pretty blonde and the show kind of made you want to hate her. But she turned out to be such a strong character, very good at her job, studied hard and the most loyal friend in the show. She ended up being my favourite character. She showed me that you can be a complete _girly girl_ and still kick ass. I've only seen a few good portrayals of that kind of character since. She didn't wear heels and make up because she was a girl, she wore them because she was Chantelle, and I think that's something a lot of media misses. It's also a lot more obvious if a show has a bunch of lady characters, because then you can say _they are doing this because they are that kind of character, to because they are the only woman_.","1438388042"
