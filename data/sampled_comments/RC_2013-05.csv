I don't think the pain relief for me has been much better than taking a good amount of norco throughout a given day.

The current score of a post can easily influence the perception of it. If you see something offensive at +30, it's a joke. If you see something offensive at -30, the poster's an asshole. Hiding the score takes that way, and forces everyone to judge a post on its own merits like you do - not relying on the hivemind as many do (and I'm sure all of us are influenced at least a little by the current score, whether we do it consciously or not).","1367366404"

Had they just asked for money once I'd be more sympathetic, but at what point does it stop? Yes I realize that adoption is expensive, and as a parent I do sympathize with their plight, but given ALL the money they're asking for (they appear to be looking for others to foot the bill, not just provide additional cash from what I can tell) I feel like they're just asking for too much.

Of they can lay down this kind of security, then imagine what they'd do in a revolution. Imagine the government just lays down some crazy shit, something big enough to unite the citizens against the government, then how are we supposed to do anything other than submit when the government can pull shit like what's being discussed.  This situation may have been dealt with with positive intentions, you know catching the terrorist, but the people making the calls behind that force still, at least in my mind, don't have the best of intentions in general.  With the way things are going, just corruption being laid upon more corruption throughout governments and business as time goes on, something like that may happen and then look what we're up against.

Aldon is much younger at 23, but only has 2 more years left on his rookie contract. With lots of other contracts coming up in the next couple years it's not a sure thing that we'll be able to keep him after that, so I guess we could end up with a Lemonier/Brooks tandem at OLB for a couple years.

Also, there is a reason I only discussed Katarina. Akali and Rumble can always utilize boots lvl 1 since they do not have much mobility before lvl 6.

"civ","t5_2rk3b","It depends a lot on the difficulty, game speed, and what you gain by moving. I usually play on king or emperor (standard speed), and I'll often spend two turns to get a good spot, three if I think it's worth it. Past that it might become an issue. The lower difficulty you are on (and the slower your game speed) the longer you can wait to settle, but generally don't wait more than four or five turns unless your spot *really* sucks (at which point it might be better to just roll a new map). I always try to move my warrior to a hill to get a peek at the surrounding area before deciding.

The best things to move for are probably rivers and a hill if you didn't start on one, and any extra luxuries you  might see. Also consider mountains; being two tiles from one will allow you to build certain wonders, and being next to one will allow you to build an observatory and maybe another wonder (can't remember if it's two tiles or one). Too many mountains can be detrimental however, because you lose a lot of workable tiles. 

I'm kind of 50/50 on putting my capitol on the coast. You some advantages, and it's easier to build the great lighthouse in your capitol, but you also don't get much from ocean tiles unless you have a *lot* of luxuries. Later in the game they can be better, but when you are just starting out it can hurt. Putting your capitol on the coast also means it can be attacked and captured by enemy navies (though the AI's generally suck at building ships). I favor putting my second or third city on the coast if I'm near it.

Tile-wise I like hills/grasslands, with as many tiles next to rivers as possible. Having a mountain range nearby is great for defense. Also being near a large jungle is great (especially as Monty), but starting *on* jungle tiles sucks because you need techs to cut them down. Later in the game with the right policies and techs, jungle tiles can be amazing for gold and science. Tundra and desert tiles are bad, unless you manage to get Petra in which case desert tiles can be amazing.

Also a tip: push Y when you are picking a spot for a city, it will display the yields of all the tiles.","1367366411"

(Un?)fortunately, your bike is going to look like a good bike to anyone in the know.  Proper security is probably going to do you more good than making your bike ugly.  Your bike isn't worth *that* much that you want to spend $400 securing it, so here's a few tips.

First, you can get rid of any quickreleases, in favor of either [locking skewers](http://www.amazon.com/Pinhead-Bicycle-Locking-Skewer-Pack/dp/B001Y9X328), [gravity skewers](http://www.amazon.com/OnGuard-MinPin-3-Piece-Locking-Skewer/dp/B00773XY9M/), or something else that will make taking the tires off more of a pain.  

Second, use a u-lock *and* a cable lock.  Both wheels should be secured separately, both to the frame, and at least one of the locks through your bike rack (both should fit, if your u-lock fits right now).  The purpose of the two types of locks is to require two types of tools to free your bike from the rack.

Third, get renter's/homeowner's insurance to cover the bike.  Should be less than $10 a month, and will give you peace of mind.  

Finally, if you just want to prevent people from riding away with your bike, there are.... [other... less safe-for-work methods](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wb8bAl1P-N0/SD_w94R_2MI/AAAAAAAACXc/G6EEX5zfGjQ/s1600/dildo%2Bbike.jpg)...","1367366413"

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Brooke is blinding you from where the actual problem lies -- your boyfriend. He is choosing this petty, immature, slandering bitch who threatened you over your relationship. He's 26 years old, but acting like he's fresh out of high school with the drama.  The ultimatum of ""friend her or else"" is bullshit. Seriously?  ""Be her friend on FB or we'll break up"" is pathetic and manipulative. Have you asked him why it's so important to him that you all play nice with her? Why is he willing to put you in an uncomfortable situation and risk the relationship over a meaningless friendship with this girl.

It's pretty concerning that he is ""blackmailing"" you into being friends with her and apologizing for stuff. That's seriously none of his business and the fact he feels he can force you into things is a huge red flag. I can see advice or ""Hey, wouldn't it be nice to talk to her again?"" but to force you into things? Nu-huh, not ok.","1367366414"

Mar. 5 - Canam put it in the post

Mar. 8 - I sign for it.

So from what I can see, most of the delays happen at the dealer side.  So if you have a good dealer, it's fast.  I just ordered a TT33 from a guy on CGN EE, he had the paperwork into CFC the day he got payment.  I'm guessing it will be in the post tomorrow afternoon.  YMMV.","1367366414"

"guns","t5_2qhc8","Then that makes things even easier. The only thing you gotta deal with though, did the ATF pull on of their rulings where this is ok for Sig, but no one else deals?

The best thing about this, is this is a barrel someone could buy for $400, have immediate use for it, then buy the shroud for $150, with $200 stamp, and wait. It's essentially makes a &lt; than $800 SBR/suppressor, that can be used right away. Which, I think is a big turn off for people. 

The thing that keeps normal people away from NFA items is the wait time. Really, who wants to spend $1000+ on an item, wait almost a year to get it. Then when you realize you hate shooting a gun with a huge can sticking off of it, then it's another $500, and another long wait. 

Having a normal length barrel, on multiple guns, with the interchangeability of what essentially is a taxed tube, is a game changer.","1367366416"

Australia is an awesome place to live for all sorts of reasons, and a few extra percentage points of tax isn't going to change the equation substantially.

If you're concerned about macro-economic impacts, it's probably much more relevant to look at how extra taxation might impact people's spending, consumer confidence and the like.  Emigration isn't a big problem, especially given the vast number of people trying to move *to* Australia!","1367366416"

"cscareerquestions","t5_2sdpm","CS major here, and I have to say I'm in the same boat as you. I'm afraid of having a job that I hate, but pretty much nobody gets to work at Google or Amazon or any of the big companies. I've accepted that fact awhile ago; I'd say you definitely should simply because 1) you like programming and 2) computers aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Not sure, but I think a degree in computer science is one of the best you can get in terms of job security.

All that being said, make sure you go to an engineering or technical school. The school I'm at has a good computer science department, but I find myself disliking the majority of my classes (they're pretty tedious, dealing with machine code and assembly rather than designing software) but the base knowledge you obtain in class is invaluable. You learn to think analytically and logically and that's helped me in my personal projects so much.","1367366422"

Here are a two ""hypothetical"" scenarios that show each.

#1 player Dagny Taggart wants to start a railroad so they get a liscense from the Government (mods) this loscense costs money. To start working Taggart buys material for rails from rearden metal. To get his metal, Rearden buys ore from and coal from the Dannager coal mines and D's aconia mining. When Taggart has her railline set up companies like Rearden metal can ship their resources on said line. Multiple people enter each industry driving compitition.

#2 Using the above scenario, let's assume Rearden loses a reliable supply of metal so he decides to buy a mine from an exsisting mine owner. Money is exchanged and Rearden now has a liscense for mines as well as his foundries.","1367366423"

The NC should get a super powerful rail gun but with one draw back. It blows up after a single use and does half damage to the enginer. So a full health engineer would have its shield gone and no more turret. The cooldown wouldnt start until after its been blown up. ","1367366425"

"headphones","t5_2rcyx","I bought the V-Moda M-100s recently in white and I have to say, compared to the G35s I've been using for years (finally cracked and about ready to dismantle themselves) they sound just wonderful. I'm sure for real audiophiles they might be able to tell that they've not been worn in properly yet or whatever but the quality of sound coming from them is absolutely phenomenal to my untrained ears. My one complaint is that they are much tighter and a smaller fit than I would have gone for normally but as I also use them while out and about they are very appropriately sized. They give a bit of an ache after a while of using (5+ hours) but I'm used to the loose fit of the stretched-to-hell G35s and these are becoming more comfortable with time anyway. The build quality is amazing. The hinge that lets them fold is probably the most solid bit of steel I've seen on any headset and they really just feel like you got what you paid for, a fantastic piece of kit. If the M-100s are in your price range then I would say maybe you should go for them. However, like I've read a couple of times in other headphone upgrade comments, I now feel like I need to upgrade my entire music collection to at least 320kbps+ mp3 or lossless formats and grab a decent soundcard as well (probably not a bad thing).","1367366428"

Not sure if thats the actual problem though since it seems to be running on your first and last screenshot.~~


~~It says ""not enough storage available..."" maybe your disk is full?!~~


~~could also be a variant of the intel bug. It might have to do with problems with the allocation of virtual memory, which would explain the ""out of storage"" error message....~~



~~**tl;dr:** Use the 64bit batch. If your disk is not full it might be the intel bug.~~

EDIT:
Alright, after some research, I am pretty sure the error means that you are running out of heap memory. Funny thing is, that should not happen on a 64 bit system ~~which you obviously have~~ (given enough ram is installed). How much ram do you have? Does the error persist if you use the 64bit batch file?

In the 64bit batch, try to change the xmx parameter to ""-Xmx1024m"" or higher if it's not already like that.

Do you have a 64 or a 32 bit system?? An easy way of determining that is to check if theres a ""Program Files (x86)"" folder. If it is NOT there (=32bit) google for ""3gb switch"", else try the above.","1367366428"

It's not like that. Despite however much hard they may have accidentally caused, they were coming from a good place. They have always been there for me, and honestly felt that I was needlessly breaking my back for an unreachable goal.

I would have got rid of them in a heartbeat if I had felt they were just saying those things to hold me down.

&gt;You just said that strangers, even behind the veil of anonymity, have told you that you're not ugly. So why are you working overtime to ignore the evidence?! You're contradicting yourself. You're not ugly but you're determined to think you are.

Eh, AIU is kinda a circlejerk where people just tell each other they're good looking. Plus I feel that people in real life have a better sense of what I look like than my photogenic pictures. That may not be the case, but it's how I justify it to myself at least.

&gt;Let me ask you something, if I was drinking something and had a sour look on my face every time I took a sip, would you want any of it if I offered you some? So to, is your attitude convincing others not to give you a try.

There is definitely some truth to the attitude coming through in my approaches, but I have worked my ass off on ""faking it until I make it."" I have done tons of work on eye contact, smiling, and posture, even before I learned to not like the way I look. I'd think that it'd get me at least one metaphorical nibble from the opposite sex, especially with me putting myself out there quite often. Still though I haven't even been flirted with, let alone k or f-closed. If my friends had told me I was ugly, but I was getting attention from women, I would have laughed in their face. But my reference experiences kinda prove them right to my shame :\

My instincts want me to tell you that there's no possible way that person 2 in your example is as bad looking as I am, but that's my BDD talking and I have no way of knowing. All I can tell you is that I want you to be correct, I really really do (why I've broke my back working in this). I just don't know how to produce that level of charisma/attitude despite all my efforts to do so. If it isn't my looks than I'm afraid I just don't have that ""It"" factor or whatever it may be. Either way it's scary to me to think there's in impregnable barrier between me and success cause I want it *sooooo* bad.

 &gt;I think you're lying to yourself and overlooking reality. I'm willing to bet that you get interest or attraction sometimes, but you squash it with your attitude and/or talk yourself out of believing that it's real. I don't know how many times I was out with Friend #1 and saw girls express interest in him, only to watch him negatively talk himself out of believing it was true, and simultaneously convince them that they were wrong to be attracted to him. It was frustrating to watch.

I very well might be purposely obscuring some of my successes or rationalizing some experiences. The thought has crossed my mind often. I can assure you though that I never ever self-deprecate or belittle myself when talking. I always try to maintain good body language, eye contact, and make sure I smile. I just can't help but think that there would have been some experiences that I would have had that could not be rationalized, like someone obviously flirting with me, a random make-out, or even attention from someone heavyset or someone who doesn't take care of themselves. 

An easier way I can put it is this: with as much as I put myself out there, I would wager 19/20 guys (at the very minimum) who worked on themselves as much as I have would have gotten someone even accidentally attracted to them to a point it was obvious.

&gt;If you have such consistent through patterns undermining you (thoughts of being unattractive), you fucking OWE it to yourself to constantly stand up to yourself and reiterate the fucking truth: such thoughts fly in the face of evidence to the contrary.

You're absolutely right about trying to be positive. It's just that whenever I try telling myself I'm attractive enough, my mind reminds me multiple ways why I'm wrong. My goal is to reframe everything to be positive though, however difficult it is.

I know I was negative throughout this, but I just felt you get an accurate picture of how my mind thinks through these kinds of arguments. You should know though that I really appreciate all you have wrote, and hope you are correct.

At the very least, you convinced me to press on a bit more. And I am incredibly thankful for that.","1367366428"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","Why? In what way?  

A superstition is ""a widely held but irrational belief in supernatural influences, especially as leading to good or bad luck, or a practice based on such a belief."" (OED).

Belief in a god is emotional rather than rational.  Some set of events happen and the emotional side of believers might see it as a supernatural intervention.  i.e.Praying that someone gets well and then they do.  The believer says god answered the prayers.  No evidence one way or the other for that statement.  It is not rational; it is emotional.

In no way am I saying that emotional thinking is bad.  Without it we would not have ""love"" or ""beauty.""  Emotional thinking takes an event, creates a meaning that causes an emotion.  And emotions are what gives life its bounce.

Human beings are mix of emotional and rational thinking.  It varies by person.  Neither is bad or wrong while the other is right or good.  The rational side is interested in what is workable and gets results.  The rational side sets and objective and goes in a nearly straight line to achieve the goal.  The rational side is not very interested in the side effects of reaching the goal.

The rational side accomplished great things at a great cost and accepts the casualties along the way. i.e. Ford decided that fixing the Pinto was more expensive than paying the judgments resulting from the law suits.  That is a very rational way to view the world.

The emotional side determines that some costs are too high to pay regardless of the great thing that must be forgone.  So Ford loses a lot of good will when their position was made public. And we save an endangered species and forbid developing a wetlands.

People with a reasonable balance between emotional and rational thinking are called ""moderates.""  :)","1367366430"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","It's an interesting video, no doubt, but  Morgan Freeman's mistaken, if only about this one thing. He's right about Black History Month, but he's wrong about the 'Stop talking about it will solve it' perspective. Time and time again, any method of 'colourblindness' as a cure for racism is shown to be unhelpful and even negative.

Going to post a part of an essay by Tim Wise (yes, a white guy) and a link for those interested. You don't have to buy into it, but it makes for some food for thought contrary with Morgan Freeman's thoughts regardless. The Morgan Freeman video gets posted every so often, and just for the sake of diversity, perhaps seeing a different perspective might be of value. 

&gt;**Liberal Colorblindness and the Perpetuation of Racism**

&gt;By “liberal colorblindness” I am referring to a belief that although racial disparities are certainly real and troubling — and although they are indeed the result of discrimination and unequal opportunity — paying less attention to color or race is a progressive and open- minded way to combat those disparities. So, for instance, this is the type of colorblind stance often evinced by teachers, or social workers, or folks who work in non-profit service agencies, or other “helping” professions. Its embodiment is the elementary school teacher who I seem to meet in every town to which I travel who insists “they never even notice color” and make sure to treat everyone exactly the same, as if this were the height of moral behavior and the ultimate in progressive educational pedagogy.

&gt; But in fact, colorblindness is exactly the opposite of what is needed to ensure justice and equity for persons of color. **To be blind to color, as Julian Bond has noted, is to be blind to the consequences of color, “and especially the consequences of being the wrong color in America**.” What’s more, when teachers and others resolve to ignore color, they not only make it harder to meet the needs of the persons of color with whom they personally interact, they actually help further racism and racial inequity by deepening denial that the problem exists, which in turn makes the problem harder to solve. To treat everyone the same — even assuming this were possible — is not progressive, especially when some are contending with barriers and obstacles not faced by others. If some are dealing with structural racism, to treat them the same as white folks who aren’t is to fail to meet their needs. The same is true with women and sexism, LGBT folks and heterosexism, working-class folks and the class system, persons with disabilities and ableism, right on down the line. Identity matters. It shapes our experiences. And to not recognize that is to increase the likelihood that even the well-intended will perpetuate the initial injury.

Sadly, he only ever played this song one time (or at least it's only ever been recorded live once).  As far as I know, it's never seen a studio release, although with the tremendous amount of material Buckethead's put out in the last couple of years, I can't possibly say for sure.  This is unfortunate, since I'd have to say Trina's Lament is one of the top ten Buckethead songs, which is impressive in a category of thousands, if not tens of thousands.  It seamlessly melds the influences of his mellower albums like *Colma* and *Electric Sea* with funk, hybrid picking, and his more trademark soloing sound found on tracks like Soothsayer.  Although it only briefly touches on the lightning speed he's famous for, it still ranks among one of his greatest solos just for the sheer amount of emotion he puts into it.

God can allegedly do *anything*. If he is married to his believers, and just allows reality to happen as usual to his believers, that's not exactly being faithful, is it?

A miracle is an indication that God is intervening directly. As such, we'd expect to see a significant number of miracles which occur for Christians who pray. I expect miracles from a faithful God because they are a demonstration of faithfulness.","1367366441"

I'm on a sort of paleo diet, and I can confirm the absence of processed foods and refined carbs makes it hard to gain fat. I'd personally just stick with paleo - I honestly don't believe the fat free ranch is going to make much of a difference, just make sure there aren't too many calories (ie loads of sugar) in it and factor it into your daily allowance.

I'll agree that there are more important problems with sexism in the world than boobs in games. That doesn't make this not sexism, however.

I don't think that's acceptable, at all.  Not everyone has loving parents who are going to go ""Oh sure honey, let's drive down and snag you a day after pill.""  And you can't paint all 15+ teens with the same brush.

&gt; However, if you think back to that time when you were that age, you would remember that you think you know everything, that you are invincible - now you know you were just a stupid little kid.

That doesn't apply to everyone, it probably doesn't even apply to most of them - I wouldn't know I'm not a child psychologist.  Either way, like I said, you cannot justify not offering this service to people who need it because some people might abuse the system.

&gt;I would much rather that the government spend money on opening more planned parenthood clinics where these kids can go get prescriptions for birth control that can be monitored for side effects and efficacy.

Sure, that'd be great, but why not both?  If I understand correctly from OP's short blurb on the topic the pill still has to be purchased, so how much money is this costing the government?  Because it sounds like 0.

&gt;I have no problem with grown adults doing what they want with their bodies.

Where is the distinction between child and adult?  You can put a 15 year old away for first degree murder, sentenced as an adult, because the law says that they are old enough to understand what they have done.  How is this different?","1367366451"

The American Nations is actually an historical exploration of what makes distinct *cultures*, while the Nine Nations are an exploration of modern politics. And while the two definitely interact (and Woodard pays homage to Garreau's ideas and work in the introduction), it looks at the immigration patterns that formed the cultural core of these regions, and the values that were inherited from their origins, instead of the way that these regions were shaped by the environment and historical events that have directly shaped individual regions.

As an example, Woodard will explore how the founding of the Tidewater area by dispossessed younger sons of English nobility led to a distinct social stratification inherited from England, while the Scottish and Irish immigrants to Appalachia brought a distinct clan structure to that culture, and those cultural influences still shape power and politics in those places. On the other hand, Garreau dispenses with these pre-settlement factors, but focuses on the effects of the civil war, reconstruction, and the industrial revolution on Dixie and the Foundry, that leads to values and policies that also shape those regions. So, even though the two works are attempting to explain much the same reality, they do so from vastly different perspectives. Somewhere out there is a coherent synthesis of the two.","1367366454"

I believe they need to add/improve this:

* Connectivity issues and host migration. I don't know any other game that stops gameplay just so there can be a new host.
* IMPROVE GRAPHICS
* Make the new engine good.
* Make the maps bigger with more people. At least 12 v 12 or 14 v 14
* More destruction. I dont want to be limited to glass, barrel and car.
* Dedicated servers*
* Improve the guns. The gun sounds and the recoil. 

What they need to keep:

* Zombies or something like zombies.
* Interaction with the players. For instance on mw3 when they had infected and new stuff like that.

I will have to check. assuming the department switches to the 15th edition and i use it for all my semesters, will it make sense in the long run to keep buying new editions? (i guess you can prorate the cost over the amount of years kieso updates his text)

&gt;My beef with downloading it is that unless you want to be on your laptop all the time to use the text, its a heck of a lot easier to use the actual book. You wouldn't be able to highlight, underline, or scribble notes.

well at least with financial accounting i bought a old edition of a random introductory textbook that cost like 2 dollars because (from my limited experience) the fundamentals of accounting never change

&gt;You're going to be using it for at least two semesters worth of class + if you decide to keep it to study for the CPA exam.

good point

&gt;Basically, Kieso is the Bible of Intermediate. It's not one of those books where you can get away with getting an older edition, unless you have access to the solutions to that edition.

maybe thats why im attached to the 14th edition, because the solutions are already online and there is no real guarantee that some dude is gonna upload the solutions to the 15th edition

First off, as you probably don't know the rules (you're a damned New Yorker, and think you're the shit because you support the Yankees, and it's irrelevant whether or not you do because &lt;continue obligatory anti-NYC rant&gt;) I shall explain them to you. 

#1) You are guaranteed an independent 3rd party to back you up in arguments; MA provides one to all those who hail from MA. I'm going to assume you don't have one (you cannot argue your fiancé is one, if he is there's something wrong), so I hereby volunteer my services on behalf of MA.
#2) For arguments with those who *also* hail from MA, your independent 3rd party (from now on, it is assumed I am the 3rd party) shall back you up *provided* the facts support your argument.
#3) For arguments with those who are from the New England region, I shall support you in full, unless my politics differ from yours, in which case I shall support you *only* if the facts support your case.
#4) For arguments with those outside the New England region, I shall support you regardless, and shall find + interpret whatever ""facts"" are necessary to support your position
#5) If sufficient facts are unavailable, I shall research the area your opponent is from and provide you with sufficient personal insults to make them feel bad about themselves.
#6) When you need my support, if it is via text message or e-mail you should contact me first, so I can find the needed facts and get back to you. If it's face to face, or time is of the essence, you can pre-obligate me to support you, i.e. just claim you have independent 3rd party confirmation of your argument, and let me know after the fact so I can support you.

I've got an endorsement on the way, I'll edit this comment when it arrives. So those are the rules... do you see now the benefits of attaching yourself to someone from MA? Think about that next time you yell at him for leaving the toilet seat up.","1367366456"

Why?

Why do you feel so sad? So miserable?

Can you find a reason? Really search. If there is no reason, then you need help. From someone who *can* help. Some peoples brains are different. From birth, sometimes, or they just developed differently. That's what the medication is for, that's what the therapy is for. To help those people. I don't think I can help you. I haven't made any progress: every thing I say to you, you pick your way around all my upsides. All my logic, all my philosophy, all the hopes. I feel like *I'm* hurting you. I probably am.

I was going to put some White Dog in the barrels to age but after reading your article and some of the comments below I am now leading toward placing a cheap whiskey that has already had some aging in the bottle like a WL Weller, Buffalo Trace, Rittenhouse or the like and just adding to the aging in the barrel.  I am thinking this because of the drawbacks to smaller barrels you mention.  So is this a good idea or is it not necessary?

Also I was planning on just keeping the barrel in my wine cellar, but after a coworker told me I should move it around my house to expose it to different temperatures and environments and the same concept was mentioned here, I'm wondering if I need to do that as well.  Could you provide any sagely wisdom here?

"realmadrid","t5_2rr0e","You make two points here and I'll refute each one easily.

&gt;Higuaín and Benzema are some of the most irregular players at the top level, so it's almost like a blind bet when either of one plays; Madrid can't afford that.

How do you want them to be regular when they aren't regular players on the pitch? Each player plays half the season, and together they manage to shoot half of what Cristiano does. Asking for regular play when you spend half the time on the bench is ludicrous at best.


&gt;It's an opinion, but I'm sure another striker wouldn't have missed what Higuaín missed today and would be a lot more effective season wise.

Cristiano missed an in front of goal opportunity today and so did Ozil. Benzema has missed many and Di Maria as well. 


Today, Lewa missed an easy as fuck goal. Twice. 


Speak to me about this legendary striker who doesn't miss ever. It doesn't exist. Numerically and visually, your argument holds no weight. I've never met a striker who doesn't miss. The fact that Higuain and Benzema manage to stay afloat is miraculous considering that neither is a starter.

I remember we turned it off and turned in for the night.  The next morning, we were up at 6 and playing it in our pjs.  My mom bought down Ego Waffles and we ate and got a sugar high.  We played the entire day.  My friend's parents came over and picked my friends up.  My parents took me back to the video game store and I returned Super Mario 3.

Take str_replace and strpos, for example:

str_replace uses an underscore in its name, uses the search argument first and subject being searched last (with the replace value in between).

strpos neglects the underscore in its name, uses the search argument last and subject being searched first.

"dbz","t5_2sdu8","Why exactly? He's a whiny ponce who does nothing but gripe on how much stronger Goku is than him and letting his ego cause immeasurable suffering to those around him. 


Sure he fathers Trunks who saves history by going back in time, but that was all Trunks, hell I'll bet Gohan raised him more than Vegeta did given the Androids offed him when they arrived. It would explain why Majin saga Trunks is a spoiled mix of Bulma and Vegeta, Android saga Trunks had a much better role model than his actual parents.


Yeah Vegeta keeps Krillin and Gohan alive long enough for Goku to arrive, but its his fault they needed to go to Namek in the first place given he ordered Nappa to kill Goku's friends, they wouldn't need the Namekian Dragon Balls.


He lets Cell absorb 18 just so he could showcase his power, enough said.


The Majin Saga shows this more than ever when he kills a large Stadium of people just to provoke Goku into fighting to showcase his ill gotten power. He willingly gave into Bobidi's evil when he could have simply ended him right then and there, kill Dabura and Bobidi and the carnage Buu would have unleashed would have never happened. But no, he needed to be a spoiled brat, he needed to remind everyone that he's 'the Prince of all Saiyans' and that he's the strongest. Look at all the damage he's caused, he provoked Frieza into Transforming, allowed Cell to attain Perfection, fueled the release of Majin Buu, when shit hits the fan its because he had to go mess it up with his damnable Pride.


That revelation that Goku was stronger than him during the fight with Kid Buu should have happened when Goku fought Frieza. Goku became the Legendary Super Saiyan, he proved that a Lower Class could defeat a Noble with training, he proved himself as a fighter. And yet Vegeta still saw himself better than Goku and he did everything in his power to make that idea a reality, which never fucking happened thankfully.","1367366472"

&gt;May 2011: A lot of folks are shaking their heads after learning that FCC commissioner Meredith Attwell Baker is leaving her post to take a lobbying job at Comcast just a few months after she voted to approve Comcast's massive purchase of NBC Universal. Now, let's be clear: there's nothing illegal in her taking this job. While she can't lobby the FCC for two years, she can lobby Congress or other parts of the government. And, it doesn't mean that she's corrupt at all. But it's this kind of move that makes people trust our government less and highlights why so many people believe that our government is corrupt.

I would think most religious people will argue that God always existed, and chose to make the universe/world when he saw fit. Science, on the other hand, tells us that the most likely explanation is that all the matter in the universe was condensed in a singularity until the Big Bang, about 14 billion years ago, and has been expanding outward as a result of the explosion ever since. But where did that singularity come from?? Science doesn't have any solid answer for that as of now. That is where ""The Last Question"" makes me ponder. This curiosity about what came before the universe is what led me to think of myself as a [deist](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism) of sorts, though still partly agnostic. I believe that there could have been a higher power that put the first matter into existence in the form of a singularity, but after that, took no active role in the workings of the universe, but rather left everything to the natural physical laws, perhaps which He himself made.

My brother is finishing up a degree in Asian Studies with a emphasis on Japanese Culture and he doesn't really understand it(don't worry, he already finished a semi useful degree and is just doing this one for the kicks and because he still has scholarships).  

So I am going to mangle parts of it.  Ask a Japanese friend if you want a good answer.

A lot of ""pronouns"" in Japanese have multiple meanings probably because they came from other words.  Anata means ""you"" literally but when directed at a significant other it changes meaning.  It becomes something like ""dear"" or ""honey"" but can be used by either sex interchangeably(Japanese can be quite a gendered language even though the actual rules of it are not).  But it means more than ""dear"" does in English because it implies a more romantic atmosphere.  It is the kind of word you would see in old romance movies.  It can also be a little teasing.

But if you use it towards someone you don't know it is pretty rude.  Not in the sense of overstepping boundaries but more in the sense of ""Hey you"".  Except more rude than that.","1367366480"

Well I asked you to define the letter, in order to avoid equivocations and misunderstanding. Furthermore, your side of the argument should be clear and exact, without me putting effort to *decipher* them. Etiquette my friend.

&gt;(...)all the premises could be found to be true with the conclusion to be false. Therefore, the argument (...) is invalid.

Okay, so you basically say that his argument is a *non-sequitur*, i.e. conclusion does not follow from the premises. 

* If god is transcendent, then god is neither ""a being"" nor ""being qua being""

* A god that transcends being / all conditions-relations is a god that is unconditional-nonrelational. ""Existence &amp; nonexistence"" is indiscernible. **Only non-being is necessary.**

*  If god is transcendent, then god is (a) non-being. It does not exist. 

&gt; as we both agree god must (if it is traditionally &amp; properly god) -- does not entail ""the in-discernibility of existing &amp; not existing"", the argument -- that essentially a ‘transcendent god’ is no more of a fact than is a ‘five-sided triangle’


**summed**: A transcendent factual claim is false/empty. Since it's existence is in-discernibility of existing &amp; not existing"".

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Another reason was that President Wilson refused to prepare the US Army for war (I believe he even refused to send observers to Europe). This was one of Teddy Roosevelt and the Republicans' main criticisms of Wilson at the time. While Wilson eventually agreed to an expansion of the navy (over a period of 10 years), he still left the army neglected. The size of the active US Army was about 100,000 (for a comparison, that was what Germany was *restricted to* after the war by the Treaty Of Versailles).

Only when war became imminent was the Army expanded. Because the suddenly enlarged US Army had to be so quickly drafted, trained, and some would say *rushed* into the field naturally the troops were not only inexperienced in combat, but the commanders weren't familiar with the advanced style of modern European warfare. This lead to frequent misuses of US forces and high casualty rates. 

Shortly after the outbreak of WWII in Europe, George C. Marshall said *""You know, I know, all of us know that the time factor is the vital consideration — and vital is the correct meaning of the term — of our national defense program; that we must never be caught in the same situation we found ourselves in 1917.""*","1367366480"

Some of the great things I've learned about Marcos:
*All FV employees get 50% off.
*Customers can order you food, then walk around and pick out your movie, and pick up your food after you've rented.
*If you have a movie due, or wanted to rent a movie, but don't want to leave your house, order Marcos for delivery and they will also deliver/pick up your rental.

So the 'two year super majority' lasted only a few months, half of them over Christmas. It was at that time that ACA was passed.

The Lord: As odd as it is, a Clonefield is better than a Shadow Field I feel these days with challenges and you being able to avoid attacks you want to avoid. Assuming you keep the Klaivex in the Incubi (Because where else would the PGL go but the Incubi?) You have 2 characters which can support each other's back in CC without the other one working.

Troops are actually fine, though no Blaster or Dark Lance hurts them. If you plan to move with the Raiders, give them Blasters, if you plan to hang back as far as possible and only move in efforts to kite, Dark Lance. Same applies if you want Night Shields - If you're kiting, yes keep them, try to get Flickerfields to stand a chance vs Tau. If you're moving? Sails/Shock Prow are nice. Sails let you do some very good maneuvers like drop the Warriors off, and then when you need to re-mount, come speeding across the table and still pick them up (Note how it says you cannot disembark after using the sails but nothing about not being able to embark, so move 6+2D6"" ;)) Shock Prows let you ""convince"" models to move into ranges they don't like being at and good later on for Blasts/Templates

I love Beasts, more than Incubi, if I would change anything it'd be the Incubi and the Archon in lieu of gettin more stuff, another beast pack included. since what you got here is probably already bought - Don't bother with the Bloodstone, get a power instead. Using a Flamer template just invites you to knock yourself out of a possible charge, and in assault is where you want to be.

Ravager and Razorwing, both fine, Ravager needs Flickers nowadays to live as does a Razorwing in some cases.

Reavers ick, too big for this size, tone them down, even MSU units with 1 Heat Lance and no upgrades to bladevanes (at this level, in 1750+ you can add those dood-ads in) are annoying with 3+ Cover Saves and FNP some of the time.

And yeah, I just don't feel like there's a good way to balance that without actually restricting access to large numbers of PPCs. I don't really mind Awesomes being able to mount 3 PPCs, though, since the chassis has significant drawbacks to go with its weapon strengths.

While we're on the subject of the Awesome, let's talk about how this system might promote diversity, disregarding the issue of balance for the moment. Right now, the Awesome has NOTHING going for it. It can't do anything the STK, AS7, or (and?) CTF can't do better. Seriously, when is the last time you saw an Awesome on the field in a semi-serious match?

Under this system, if you want to mount more than two PPCs, you basically have to bring an AWS. It gives the 'mech a true niche. This applies to many other 'mechs as well, and allows them to carve out their unique places on the battlefield based on what their weapon mounts allow. 

You'll see a much wider variety of 'mechs with varying strengths and weaknesses. Good builds will definitely be harder to make, but you will see MORE creativity through implementing constraints. Of course, the comp scene will min-max the new regime, and balancing will always be necessary to ensure a wide variety of 'mechs and tactics remain viable. This system would make it more possible, and more interesting, though.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I understand on the morning wood, I can definitely see it as a reminder that you're not having sex.  

I don't know about sending it in email.  I've never really considered communicating serious relationship things with my SO via email.  I think it will have its upsides and downsides.  It will give him time to think about it, but it may also come off as a little impersonal or not compassionate.  

The bigger risk, I think, is that it will give him the opportunity to ignore the problem.  I mean, I'm not saying he will but it might run that risk.  Particularly if you don't follow it up with an actual conversation immediately.  I mean, let's say he gets the email, and doesn't say anything about it, it might just leave you more confused.  Alternatively he could just get the email and say he's thinking about it but never really follow up... 

I guess I'm saying that an email isn't a bad idea on its face, but you should definitely follow it up with some face time to talk it through. ","1367366499"

Games are my stress reliever when I leave the office (law firm) and my wife plays the games with me. Also we have no kids (except the four legged variety). My play time would be considered at a casual gamer level most days 0-1 hour (about 75% of the time), except on rare occasions where I can play all day if I get engrossed in a game (Fallout 3, Bioshock, Borderlands, etc).

I would say I have roughly 18000-20000 dollars wrapped up in just my xbox 360, and another 10000 invested in my pc and steam. I spend about 6-7 thousand dollars a year on gaming. Which for me eats up a portion of our entertainment budget. It has taken me roughly 5 years to hit 96*** gamer score.

I do understand the urge to point it out; it's annoying that some people have this way of assuming you're male until proven otherwise, but given that it is a professional context I think it's worth considering what pointing it out accomplishes and if it's worth doing (and if it is... go for it!).","1367366503"

"AskCulinary","t5_2t82m","MSG. Seriously. This has been studied quite thoroughly and all of the claims that it is unhealthy or that many people have an intolerance or that it causes ""Chinese food syndrome"" are essentially myths. If you believe MSG will make you feel like shit, then it will. But that goes for any food.

It's remains a good idea to avoid foods that use MSG, but not because MSG is directly harmful. It's just that MSG is often a sign of terrible food quality. If you use it in your own cooking, however, there is nothing wrong with it.

Do some research if you're interested. Look up the citations on Wikipedia. Search around on PubMed. The science points to a pretty clear answer, in my view.

Obviously, this doesn't mean MSG in huge quantities is ok. Like anything, moderation is generally the best. But just keep in mind that any sort of drawback you might think there is to replacing some salt with MSG, there is almost *definitely* a bigger drawback to consuming too much salt.

"Borderlands2","t5_2spu9","Well see this article isn't completely fair. If you've done the mission in the Caustic Caverns with the Echos, you'd know that a lot of the Bandits used to be miners for the Dahl cooperation. So your leaving out the fact that Dahl mined Pandora and tried to mine Crysalisks but failed and abandoned the planet, leaving their workers to fend for themselves. Now, the other thing is, all of these enemies are trying to kill you. So uh that's kind of something important. I would not just stand there and get cut up by a Psycho's buzz axe. Jack wanted to bring ""peace"" to the planet he wants to use the Warrior to control it and become the overlord and killing many people in the process. Opportunity was just another way to make money for the few that live there. Now for the characters, I admit they don't deserve to be praised but Moxxi made the competition for reasons other that just to watch people die. She never forced anyone, they willingly signed up. Or so we think. Roland killed Angel because she sacrificed herself to taking down her father Without her he couldn't charge the key. There literally wasn't any other way because she was kept alive with the Eridium. She couldn't escape. In the Arid Nexus if you find Jack's echos it reveals him blackmailing his way up and then killing the man that was in his way. Cold blooded murder. In Opportunity you can hear the announcer for the workers say terrible things. ""There's no help I'm being eaten alive in team."" ""Your lunch break starts now. 321... back to work."" He obviously doesn't care about his human workers and he can always fabricate more robots that kill people. So really, just about all of the characters have done bad. You can't really pick sides here. But seriously they live on a god damn savage planet where people kill each other all the time, there's no government and just no rules. Is anyone a perfect person in those conditions?

Yes, there are superficial qualities that can be used as an indicator of trashiness, like a ""tramp stamp,"" or ""skunk hair,"" or a tongue ring. I don't think that nipple piercings are one of them, though, because they are not clearly displayed for everyone to see, unless they make a point of showing them off, in which case they are definitely trashy.

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","Thanks for this, ARAM has been hugely fun all day but I haven't been sure about what to build (apart from sustain). 

I'm a bit curious about the start though - I've been going 5 pots, 1-2 Doran, 1 part of later item (that gives sustain/HP/resistance if possible) and Rejuv if I could only get 1 Doran. The pots seem a given, but other than that I've really just been guessing. I've had decent results, but I suspect that's mostly just everybody being new, low-level and having had luck with my champs - Malph, Yi, Nunu and Lulu all felt pretty strong, even though I've only really played Lulu before, and that as Support.

Another thing: Should you play it as safe as possible or should you ""allow"" yourself to get killed if you're not making as big a contribution as you could? In my Lulu game I only died as we were taking down the Nexus - I finished 7/1/31 with a Doran's Blade, Rejuv Bead, Ruby Crustal and 5 pots as start. An extreme example, and thanks to the kit (Whimsy!) I could still provide utility, but my poke didn't exactly feel strong at the end and I was basically OOM from 7 minutes on.

"news","t5_2qh3l","As a reminder, the only reason this wasn't approved several years ago is because the Obama administration put politics ahead of science.  A federal judge [called them out on it earlier this month:](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html?pagewanted=all).

&gt;A federal judge on Friday ordered that the most common morning-after pill be made available over the counter for all ages, instead of requiring a prescription for girls 16 and younger. But his acidly worded decision raises a broader question about whether a cabinet secretary can decide on a drug’s availability for reasons other than its safety and effectiveness.
&gt;
&gt;**In his ruling, Judge Edward R. Korman of the Eastern District of New York accused the Obama administration of putting politics ahead of science.** He concluded that the administration had not made its decisions based on scientific guidelines, and that its refusal to lift restrictions on access to the pill, Plan B One-Step, was “arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable.”
&gt;
&gt;He said that when the Health and Human Services secretary, Kathleen Sebelius, countermanded a move by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 to make the pill, which helps prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse, universally available, “the secretary’s action was politically motivated, scientifically unjustified, and contrary to agency precedent.”

The problem right now is that MP10 is STILL only available to a small minority of people.

The super geared Monk / WD / DH, and any ol WW Barb with a few more CM Wizards.  If you're not any of these people, you're not on MP10.

How is this different than having 1.0.3 inferno?  When not everyone can farm A3?  What 1.0.4 did was allowed more people to farm A3, and evened the playing field.  Then people like me, was annoyed by the nerf and requested something about difficulty.  Well, obviously Blizzard does not cater to ""me"" so it must have been enough people requesting the challenge to have them develop what was MP10.

Well, now that MP10 is here, ""you"" feel as if you can faceroll MP10 you have a sense of accomplishment.  Because you are doing the hardest content this game throws at you with little to no effort.  This is a correct feeling.  It's a good feeling.

For people that have OP classes / gear to match, MP10 is no more than MP0 in it's level of challenge.  To me, MP10 does not make sense since the game favors a certain build of a certain class more than most.

This makes the community funnel into a single build of a single class.  While your 1% guys will all show up and disagree, well, the facts are in the numbers.  Nearly 50% of this game has a WW Barb.  That's just WW Barbs, not just Barbs.

MP has created a communit of not Diablo players, but WW Barb players.  This however is besides the point.

The point is, facerolling is facerolling.  Challenge is challenge.  You either feel one or the other.  If you choose to  arbitrarily disregard facerolling hard content as facerolling it, then there is nothing to be done to change your mind.

How many MP levels does not change the fact that easy is easy and hard is hard.  The mobs and their abilities when 1.0.3 was out was a good difficulty and challenge for most people to overcome.  A1 inferno 1.0.3 was a very good ""stepping stone"" because they had ilvl 62 mobs.  Or lower...

You can do the same thing with ONE difficulty.  It's all a matter of balance.  You argued that having one difficulty will never produce a result of you feeling powerful.  Well, that's why 1.0.3 is relevant.  Because I felt more powerful going through content in 1.0.3 than I do today.

Anyone who plays HC will tell you the same thing.  HC means less today than it does back then regardless of MP levels.

I'm not here to change your mind about how you feel playing MP0, I'm just saying, MP10 isn't the only way.  You can continue to enjoy MP10, or when you eventually get to farm it.  However, some classes work GREAT on lower MP, so in a sense they're already ""balanced"" there.  While some scale WAY better because of the nature of their class.  When you intoruduce multiple levels of scaling on the end game content, you expose those flaws.

If you eliminated it, then you either CAN do it, or NOT.  Then it becomes clear as day how to balance something.  Because right now, Blizzard has to balance 10 games instead of one.

They have to balance every single MP level for inferno.  This is why they're failing.","1367366515"

In fact, you need to submit a petition to retain an ""I"" on your transcript, so it shouldn't just be sitting there.

Assuming you fail to recover your paper, I'd have a chat with your professor and try to negotiate the terms on which you'll complete the class. Of course he has all the power, but if you have a good grades or your GSI likes you, you can use this as ammunition for your discussion. The best case scenario is you complete the paper and submit it to your professor during the summer, whereupon he gives you a letter grade and you lose no points.

But if you're the side that's losing at the beginning, it's always good to maintain a positive outlook because the other team isn't guaranteed to win late game fights.

Some things to make a point of after you get off to a bad start:

* Don't pin the blame on anyone. Saying ""GG noob jungler"" won't make them play better. Encourage them and try to get them back in the game.

* Stop trying to simply finish with a good score. If you're the jungle, don't steal kills from your already-behind adc just to look good after a loss.

* Learn from your mistakes, because ultimately, you only died as a result of something you did. If your support/adc isn't comfortable fighting, don't fight. If you got ganked, buy wards (which you should already be doing). If you're against a champion that counters you, buy potions and just try to farm up for the late game.

* The only hard thing to deal with is a fed top lane, fed adc's and mids can still be killed instantly if they go in at a bad time or get focused in a fight. Instead of being scared of their damage output, wait for a good chance to go all in on them or until they get caught out.

* Try to fill the roles that your team needs instead of calling. That way, other people can play their comfort roles and are more likely to do better.","1367366518"

The moment you set that in your brain, you'll be setting yourself up for disappointment. So before you begin, understand that this is going to have a different taste than a real, regular pizza. 

With that, I've finally perfected my recipe for this to the point that I actually crave this dish over a regular pizza. It did take me 6 or 7 goes at it before I ended up with a crust that could be hand held, and then a few more to figure exactly how loaded I could make it. I also think that a key factor in this was moving from my big, regular oven to a [Breville BOV800XL Convection Oven](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001L5TVGW) had a big roll in this. Combine that with other trial and error tips like over-ricing and going super fine in the food processor, and then pressing out as much water before the saute step as I could really helped. 

Is it worth it? Well, that depends, doesn't it? It takes me about 45 minutes to make one from start to finish, with about 10-12 minutes of that actually cooking the thing. So I don't tend to make it often since I can broil a steak in a cast iron skillet in 6 minutes or do a couple of chicken thighs in 20.

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","I would like to see proof of your claim that in general feminists are statists. Your perception is that in general feminists are statists. My perception is that that statement is false and that the term feminists describes such a wide range of human opinion (see suffragette example above) as to warrant a less clear cut example. We do need to break things off in blocks, I'm saying that the block is too big. 

Class warfare is present in much more than just Marxism. Kant, Tonnies and Weber were all discussing the problems of class differential (note: few called it warfare but it's the same thing) before and contemporaneous with Marx.

While you may make a claim to understand the paradigms it just goes to show how weak those descriptors are left v. right. Perhaps I should not have used it as it seems to be obfuscating my point. I mean right wing as social limitations and aggressive tactics, and you are right if you go far enough on the left of the scale you get the same repressive tactics and social limitations. I could have said far right, far left, extreme, radicalized, or any number of descriptors. The point is they are not a representative sample. This is not saying that they are not feminists, it is merely stating that they do not represent all feminists. 

If you believe that women should have the vote and not be sold as property you are a feminist. I think those people outnumber the aforementioned example 1 million to one.","1367366522"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I'd like a 4x game that doesn't telegraph its victories so early.  I think when you know you've won a game the victory should be very close at hand.  The problem with most 4x games nowadays (Fallen Enchantress is probably the worst offender) is that once you know you've won you've still got turns upon turns of clean up duty which can be utterly tedious.  Especially since it feels like all the cool toys you've been building up to were complete overkill.  Fallen Enchantress can be quite challenging at early and mid game, but victory is just a binary condition where if you've survived to turn 50 or so you've essentially won.  Seems a lot of 4x games nowadays fall into that trap.

Also if you're interested in 4x games you might check out the /r/4xgaming sub.  It's slow but there's some good conversations.","1367366529"

It's actually an interesting debate, and I think the answer lies somewhere in the middle. Which is the reason we don't use technology and video refs for every single decision on the pitch- it is *not* the priority to get every single decision right versus allowing an interesting, entertaining match of football to take place.

Or at least that's my opinion anyway. So long as the dangerous stuff and the major sporting fouls (eg. Handball, professional fouls etc) are called, I think referees should be allowed a bit of leeway so that they can keep their whistle out of the way of the entertaining sport we fell in love with.","1367366538"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","So, this is gonna be a long one, but what can I say, I've been through a lot. I'll try to summarize the events that only happened occasionally, but the others require detail.

Back when I was a toddler, my parents had a new house built a town over. We moved there when it was done and everything was normal until when I was five and my grandfather (who I was quite close to) died of lung cancer. That's when things started.

Back when my grandfather was alive, whenever I fell asleep at his house, he would rub my back to help me sleep. After he died, my dad told me that one time when I was taking a nap on the living room couch, I started talking in my sleep saying ""Stop it Grandpa, I'm trying to sleep."" Dad said it scared the shit out of him, which is pretty hard to do, believe me. I also remember that whenever I went to try to sleep, it would always feel like the blankets on my back were being pushed down. I didn't make that connection until years later, after we moved.

I also remember a few times where things would turn on by themselves. Like when I was like 6, I was sleeping when the goosebumps pinball toy I had on my upper bunk of my bunk bed went off. I don't really remember it, but my parents said they thought it was me until I screamed for them. They took the batteries out, but it went off again sometime later that night. After that, my parents through it out. Only other times I remember this happening were when an electric toothbrush turned on by itself in my bathroom as my mom walked by, and one time when I was playing laser tag with my dad in my basement when the radio down there turned on by itself (even though the light on it was still glowing, meaning the thing should be off).

We also had some stuff move by itself one time. I remember that my dad was in the basement doing his morning workout and my mom was getting ready for the day. I was in the living room watching some saturday morning cartoons when suddenly a loud bang came from my right. My mom and dad came up asking what the noise was, which I had no idea. Investigating, it turned out that a candlestick that we had on a small shelf on the side of the living room staircase had fallen down, but was standing straight up - just the candle fell over. Like something had just slid it over and kept it standing as it fell.

Another thing I remember happened nightly to me. My room seemed to be a major hotspot and with the stuff that happened around the house, I was scared to death of the dark. So, when I slept, I would have a closet cracked open and have the light from inside come into my room so I have just enough light to see around in my room. Every night I remember I could stare into the light and eventually, I would see a figure in the shape of a person cross the light moving toward my side of the room. , Needless to say, this led me to learning to sleep with my blankets over my head.

The last major thing I remember happening in that house happened a few weeks before my family moved to the house we live in now. I was just starting to get over my fear of being alone in my basement and was asked to put some clothes in our utility room so they could be washed later. I remember that as I walked through the doorway to the utility room, what looked to a face appeared right in front of mine made of something I can only describe as green fire, and this face was angry. Appearing right in front of me, I ended up walking through it before I could react. When I did, I looked back and saw nothing. Frozen in fear for a second, I finally through the clothes at our washer and ran up the stairs on all fours. Never went down there again. In fact, things were scaring me so badly at that time that I ended up sleeping in my parent's room on the floor with a sleeping bag for like a month until we moved.

So yeah, that's the gist of what I've been through. Don't know if it's as good as what I've seen on here, but it is what it is.

TL;DR: I've seen some **stuff**, man. Some ***things.***","1367366539"

"NeutralPolitics","t5_2tk0i","I don't know, that's a great question. I guess it would depend on what the organizer wanted to get out of a workshop/seminar/class.

On the one hand, I love education. Everybody should be educated about everything, and if a man wants to learn what it feels like to work out or write as a woman, then power to him. Hence why there are numerous lectures and seminars and classes about these things for all people.

On the other hand, sometimes it's hard to talk about your feelings/work up a righteous sweat in a mixed group. Just as it would be inappropriate for me to attend an AA meeting out of curiosity, it might be inappropriate for a well-intentioned man to want to sit in on women talking about how their 5 page female orgasm was rejected by an editor, or how they feel objectified in the front row of a mixed yoga class.

I talked elsewhere about ""restrictive"" vs ""additive"" instances of separation, the first excluding a group from a base-level service, the second an extra, ""exclusive"" addition to said service. The distinction coming down to how many toes you really end up stepping on. Maybe I'm splitting hairs and just creating way more room for error in trying to define this ""base-level service"", but I really do believe that it's more help than harm giving minorities a safe outlet to help cope with whatever experiences they have in the free world.","1367366540"

If only people realized that breeding in captivity is an easy answer, but not necessarily the best one.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt;I see the point you're making in the first paragraph, yeah. I personally just don't really get why people would care about James Bond's skin color.

Because it doesn't look like the character. Is that not good enough, for such an established figure? Surely people have certain expectations, and one of the most basic things is having someone look the part. 

&gt; And would it become a major talking point? Sure, for a while. And by the second film probably noone would give a shit anymore. Or it would at least not be played up in the media nearly as much. And if it happened to a different character 5 or 10 years later, people would say ""oh, that happened with Bond as well, who cares?"". I don't really think that works as a point against it, on the contrary. You could make a similar case for Obama's presidency, Jason Collin's coming and probably many other things. Sure, the fact that they were the first black x or the first gay y would become talking points in the media, but that doesn't necessarily take away anything from it but instead normalizes the fact. Which I personally would consider to be desirable (not saying that a black Bond would be as important as a black president or a gay professional athlete)

I know what you're saying. And I fully concede it is the weakest point against his casting. But note I did mention two other reasons, and I consider them (alone, but especially together) to be significant enough in not going Idris' direction. I'd much rather get someone who fills a more ideal image of Bond. Find an actor that fits the character's mold, rather than remolding the character for a singular actor. ","1367366548"

 &gt; 1) How old are you? Are you male or female? What nationality/ethnicity are you?

24, female, white with a touch of Blackfoot

 &gt; 2) What is your occupation?

Computer Programmer

 &gt; 3) Did you grow up with religion? If so, which?

Traditional Roman Catholicism, including Latin Mass and creationism

 &gt; 4) If you grew up with no formal religion, what was your exposure to it? Did you ever explore it on your own?
5) How do you self-identify now?

I use the label atheist because it is useful, but I see that as similar to saying I'm a non-smoker or a non-stamp collector.

 &gt; 6) How did you come to reach your present set of ideas or philosophy?

I discovered evolution has overwhelming evidence, and then I began seeing other problems in my previous belief set. I kept discarding things, essentially.

 &gt; 7) What worked for you or what didn’t work for you in your previous system?

I do not know how to answer this. I guess the fact that there was too much guilt didn't work for me.

 &gt; 8) What do you think is your purpose in life, if any?

I don't know if I have one, and I don't know what it is. I try to do as much as I can to be good to those around me.

 &gt; 9) Do you think humanity has a purpose? If so, what?

Basically exactly what I said in the last question.

 &gt; 10) Do you think you have a soul, or that there is a spiritual aspect to your life?

I don't think I have a soul; I think my sense of consciousness is probably an illusion.

 &gt; 11) Do you believe in or observe any kind of spiritual practice? If so, which?

Nope.

 &gt; 12) How do you determine what is right and wrong? Do you create your own system, or do you also look to other sources or authorities for guidance sometimes? If so, which ones?

I just act on my empathy, at least in theory. Treat others the way they want to be treated, as much as I can.

 &gt; As a white, straight, Christian, educated, American male living in the South, I know I'm living pretty much at the top of the heap. I know that majority privilege is a thing, but I don't have many conscious experiences of it myself. Could you share with me a time where you experienced ""Christian privilege"" or saw it at work?

My workplace has an internet block labeled ""alternative spirituality"". I haven't had any problem accessing Christian sites, but I haven't tried very many. That's all I've encountered personally, I think.

 &gt; My parents got involved in non-profit medical work overseas because of their religious beliefs led them there, and that had a significantly positive impact on my faith growing up. They also taught me about evolution and gave me a love for science. Do you think that having a close friend or relative living an authentic life would have had an impact on you growing up, such that you might have pursued faith yourself?

I did pursue faith, trying for two years to believe after realizing the truth of evolution. Unfortunately, I simply could not find a good argument to return to religion.

 &gt; Emergent church leader Brian McLaren and author of A New Kind of Christian is quoted as saying (from my paraphrase) ""The question of evangelism should no longer be ""Do you want to go to Heaven?"" but ""Who do you want to be in twenty years?"" Do you agree or disagree? Do you think that Christianity offers a path to being a better person?

I think Christianity could offer a path to being a better person if people simply followed the second greatest commandment. Unfortunately, many Christians act as though anyone disagreeing with them is evil. Based on my observation, religion, particularly Christianity, gives people an excuse to be bigoted or cruel far more often than it gives them an excuse to be kind or welcoming.

 &gt; Have you had positive experiences with church? If not, what would a positive experience look like for you? What would you like to see in a church?

I have had a few positive experiences with church - I was never really a part of a faith community, but I tried to be for a while, and many of the people were nice to me. What I would like to see in a church is a lack of unsupported claims, but that's probably too much to ask for. If we must have churches based not on evidence, they should spend all their resources helping the poor, as Jesus said to do.

 &gt; Organized religion often gets a bad rap, and often deservedly so. If you were the leader of a group of people with like-minded beliefs and wanted to have a positive impact on the world around you, what would that look like and how would you do it? Along similar lines, is there anything that would get you interested in getting involved with a church, whether through non-profit work, volunteering, or anything else where you're spending time with church members?

I would like to volunteer, but am lazy. I'm more the type who gives funds than time. However, I wouldn't give money to any organized churches at this point. I'd rather donate to individuals whose stories I know. I have no idea what I would do as a leader, but I would hope it would be attempting to lessen suffering in any way possible.","1367366550"

This color took 6+ months to achieve to avoid my hair falling out. It is also very high maintenance and costly; root touch-ups every 3 weeks, semi-permanent toning every 2 weeks + sulfate-free shampoo &amp; conditioner with violet dye every time I washed my hair.

I started with [Prizm Violet bleach](http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SA-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=SBS-760020&amp;dwvar_SBS-760020_color=Violet&amp;dwvar_SBS-760020_webSize=16.0000+OZ) and mixed it with [40 vol. developer](http://www.sallybeauty.com/Clairol-clairoxide-developer/SBS-320846,default,pd.html?cm_vc=SEARCH). I had to live with orange-yellow hair for awhile because you need to bleach your hair 3-5 times to achieve the lightest color, waiting 1-2 weeks between bleaching.

I used [Wella T18](http://www.sallybeauty.com/wella-hair-color/SBS-800275,default,pd.html_ dye/toner) with [20 vol developer](http://www.sallybeauty.com/developer/CLAIRL49,default,pd.html?cm_vc=SEARCH) mixed with 8-12 drops of [purple color corrector](http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SA-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=SBS-240815&amp;dwvar_SBS-240815_webSize=.2500+OZ) to get rid of the yellow tint. (Refer to the color wheel with hair dye- whichever color you're trying to get rid of, wash your hair with its' complimentary color. Yellow hair = corrected with Purple)

I used [this shampoo](http://www.sallybeauty.com/shiny-silver-shampoo/ONEONL7,default,pd.html?cgid=Hair01-05) and sometimes added a squeeze of [Purple Passion](http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SA-Site/default/Product-Show?pid=SBS-140373&amp;dwvar_SBS-140373_color=Purple+Passion) violet dye to the bottle of shampoo -shake it a lot before use- because my hair was in horrible shape at this point and did not take to color well.

It is possible when bleaching roots to get ""banding"", which is where you put bleach on the hair that is already lightened. More bleach does NOT mean whiter hair. It means more damage once your hair is already a pale yellow. Ask for help with your roots if you're doing this at home or you will start losing small chunks of hair.

Also, if you're doing this at home, leaving your shampoo in for too long will leave your hair [pale lilac](http://ts4.mm.bing.net/th?id=H.4557858924266771&amp;pid=15.1) but it will only last 24-48 hours. Do not color over it. Your hair will fall out. Let your natural oils lift the tint and use less purple in your shampoo next time.

NO POOLS w/ CHLORINE! Your hair will turn [green](http://wallpaperscraft.com/image/light_green_solid_color_65835_2560x1600.jpg) within 15-20 minutes! I learned the hard way.

I don't need a man to give me what I want out of life... But company, friendship and sex from one I love can add a great deal to my life.

Ok... I know about two of those acronyms. My dad is mechanical, so I know a little. So what you're saying is you're going to build death robots. You are now tagged as terminator manufacturer. 

That's interesting. Most people tend to not like factories. I've never actually been in one, so I have no idea what it's like though. But yes, you seem to have a very good career ahead then. 

Ok, I apologize. That is the cutest thing, and it nullifies everything bad I said.

Exactly! It always looks so nice in your head, but then your hand doesn't really listen and just does whatever. Hand never was good at following directions.

Yeah, real world experience can be 'real'ly nice. Ha. But would you have to move or anything? And it's payed, right?

I feel the same way. Up until now my experience with people on the internet was less than stellar. So even though I know people here won't be jerks or anything, I still have that mental barrier thing. And I hear similar things from others about the mane sub as well. If I ever do go there, I just look at pictures. As for commenting, those are the easiest things to talk about, but usually as long as I can make a joke out of anything I'll try. Humor is my weapon to break my comfort wall, and I'm kind of proud of that analogy I just came up with.

I've learned so much about cars today. But how much did you pay for those? My brother has a similar situation with car problems, but I guess his is like a... car. An old car. If it looks small it's a car, if it looks like a truck it's a truck. But yeah, he's had several parts replaced in the short-ish time he's had it, plus a few accidents for good measure. So is the steering rack like, the wheel and all the stuff behind it? That sounds expensive... and banjaxed sounds like a great word.

It took me awhile to understand that... So Ireland isn't actually all drunk people getting in bar fights? My whole life is a lie...

You know, I'm now convinced this was all part of your plan to get that placement thing. I just don't see how they're related yet... But I'll find out.

Close enough... And that sounds like Oregon. Not so much in the south where I am for school, but Portland is probably the rainiest place I know. But 70 as a scorcher? Then it must be pretty cold there.

We hugged for a long time, and then I woke up crying.

If you look at movie piracy stats, Netflix almost stopped piracy when they offered their streaming option for a large catalogue of movies.

As content providers have decided that they can sell their tiny slice of content direct to the customer for the same rate as Netflix got for their entire library, piracy is coming back.

The moral is that customers will pay a reasonable price for a convenient streaming service.  But it is unlikely that they will pay 5 or 6 different services $10 a month to access content.  It's easier to pirate than to manage multiple subscriptions at a premium price.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Buddha is mentioned as an avatar or incarnation of God in Bhagavata Purana...

""Then, in the beginning of Kali-yuga, the Lord will appear as Lord Buddha, the son of Añjanā, in the province of Gayā, just for the purpose of deluding those who are envious of the faithful theist."" [SB 1.3.24] (http://vedabase.com/en/sb/1/3/24) 

The general story goes that due to Buddha's disgust with the corruption of the brahminical caste he rejected the authority of the Vedic literature. Doing this means he is no longer a ""Hindu"". So by rejecting the authority of the Veda, he makes his teachings outside of Hinduism and therefore removes the authority of the brahmins. 

His teachings are very practical actions anyone can perform without needing a priest. I would guess these ideas support your thesis. Bhagavatam claims he is an avatar of God - not God himself but directly empowered by him. If you read the purport of that verse I quoted you get Bhaktivedanta's view that it was animal sacrifices being performed on the authority of Vedic literature that was the biggest problem, and thus Buddha's doctrine of ahimsa, non-violence is important.

Religion or not, opposition to homosexuality is not the fault of Christianity. It gives people a means by which to do it, but there are plenty of those. If it weren't religion it would be evolution, or population, or economics, or plenty of other half-assed reasons people could conjure up to oppose something that is different or disconcerting to them. There aren't sermons preaching what the Bible may or may not say about homosexuality unless people are looking for a reason to oppose it.

You run this campaign, say kids are taught not to use the word slut anymore, then what? They'll just move onto the next form of bullying. It seems more likely that they'll use whatever they can to bully the individuals they are set on bullying, for whatever reason. If it's not ""she's a slut"" then it'll be ""she has red hair"" or some other bullshit.

The only smaller is the Razor Blade. As far as getting hot, any gaming laptop will do that. That being said the M17x is better than most, the only one I know that is better is the Asus but that is only a 660m or a 670m. Gaming with a laptop on your lap for an extended period is time isn't something you'd want to do, and I doubt that the laptop will overheat anytime soon. The screen is a bit shiny and one problem I've had is that the screen and the keyboard are really close while folded and my keyboard frame and screen have been rubbing together during transportation, but after a little hassle with Dell they are sending out a technician to replace both parts. The only gaming laptop I would recommend  for carrying around a lot while expecting it to hold up to some abuse would be the Razor blade, but it's much more expensive with much less performance.","1367366566"

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","&gt;Another huge fundamental question would be: How quickly do undead wear down? Can you re-animate the bodies after they've fallen apart, perhaps after some kind of repairs?

I guess they would have to use skeletons rather than zombies as bones take much longer to break or decay. Skeletons are also often depicted using weapons while zombies have slam attacks so they are probably more likely to be able to use tools and complete tasks.

&gt;Dare I suggest a campaign about the purest kind of colonialism? Necromantic civilizaton, with its surplus of free labor, rolls onto another continent to literally plunder it for bodies, and probably kill as many natives as it can. It may not be a policy of official genocide, but hey, people die when they're exposed to new diseases. Are you just going to leave the corpses around to fester? We'll dunk them in formaldehyde and put them to good use.

That's an awesome idea and I think it would make for an interesting  campaign. I was planning on having them be pretty advanced because of the excess labor but I wasn't thinking massive colonial ambitions because the creation of undead is such a taboo act naked aggression would probably have cause other nations to ally against them early in their history. 

&gt;This also raises what I'll call a human-rights issue. Presumably, necromancy does not merely impart kinetic energy to the undead; there's a consciousness in there. Where does it come from? If it's the imprisoned soul of the body's original occupant, mightn't this be an extreme form of abusing the elderly? You'd have to answer some detailed undead ecology and life cycle problems with this one.

I'm fairly certain that because you can't resurrect character raised as undead the soul is imprisoned. Within the culture this would probably seen as a form of paying your due in return for the benefits you received and letting your body be reanimated is a sacrifice made for your children and your children's children. There could definitely be a dark underbelly to this where the poor sell corpses to the rich and there are all sort of black market ways to get more bodies when they are needed. 

&gt;The answer to the second question depends, oddly, on your first one. After all, the more labor you give to the tireless undead, the more time you have to be a cleric. Also, it depends entirely on how much training being a cleric requires, doesn't it? I don't think the rules really comment on this.
Extreme cases would be that either 1. you must dedicate your entire life, beginning to end, to being a cleric or 2. you can go to a weekend seminar and gain your first level. In the first case, it depends on agricultural surpluses as in most pre-industrial societies. In the second, everyone's a cleric.
(Also: How much ability is required? How does natural ability, i.e. Wisdom, affect training time?)

When you brought up wisdom it caused me to remember something. You have to have wisdom equal to 10+the spell's level to cast it in 3.5, animate dead is a 3rd level cleric spell so you need only 13 wisdom to cast it. Assuming NPC's generate their ability scores randomly on a 3d6 only 25% of their population has the necessary wisdom to cast animate dead as a cleric and 15% as a wizard.

While I'm not sure if the DMG is really relevant for this different a society if we take a small city and just assume that because of the setting we roll maximum for the highest level character cleric is 18 and the highest level wizard is 16. Then according to the DMG we get double the number for each level lower than that. This breaks down pretty quickly because you effectively have 2^X for the total clerics where x is the highest level. and for a city of 5,000 X=2d6+6 so on average a city of 5,000 has 2^13 clerics which is 8192. 

If everyone in the population who would eventually be capable of casting animate dead (let's say 20% to account for errors in selection) becomes clerics then in a community of 5,000 we would have 1250 people who can be clerics. this means the highest level cleric is log base 2 of 1250 (10.89) and the number of clerics at least level 5 is  2^6 + 2^5 +2^4... so 126. 

You can control 4HD per caster level so by my calculations they can control 3206 HD worth of undead between them. Now normally we don't have that level of specialization throught the entire population, but assuming that over time as undead gradually took over unskilled labor so that the entire country reached the level of specialization of a small medieval city we'd see a ratio of 3206 undead for every 5,000-12,000 living people. 

High level people could increase this by creating wights or ghouls, who could then kill people in order to create spawn under their control, since the master is under the casters control so are all the spawn on which there is no limit. This could get dangerous, if the original wight dies all the other wight's go free. Also bring in people specifically to be fed to ghouls or wights is a lot harsher than simply making the dead into skeletons. It would probably be reserved only for criminals, though the wealthy could certainly pervert the justice system in some places.

The problem with spawn chaining is that of the the creatures that can be created with spells and that also produce spawn only the Ghoul is probably the best. They need to be fed flesh every 3d6 months and they can spread ghoul fever via biting but other than that they are pretty much ideal. The undead leadership feat allows you to take undead as cohorts and followers, this is probably the best way to ensure created undead for the purpose of chaining.

If you do chain with spawn you are going to need a bunch of people around for when the whole thing inevitably goes awry, that's why you have that remaining 20% of the population that are clerics who would probably specialize in rebuking undead and putting down any undead who somehow escape control. These guys would serve as overseers in the meantime. 

This society would probably also be highly stratified as a labor force equal to 3/5 or more (doubled with rods of undead mastery) of the population would be controlled by .02% of that population. ","1367366572"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","not sure if exactly paranormal. but mysterious yeah... i've had several experiences with wolves in rural east texas, they aren't exactly common here to my knowledge...

when i was 2 years old i had an uncle move in for about 6 months. i lived on a 'farm', so i was used to large animals - some pet cows, goats, etc. well, he had a pet wolf named bow. obviously i don't remember much except him being *chained* to a very heavy gauge cattle guard that was quite a bit a ways down the back driveway. this driveway led throughout the property and the cattle guard prevented cows from coming into the backyard. and my dad 'saving me' from him playing too rough with me. i don't know what the wolf did to scare my dad. it was gone the next day. i don't know how either, never asked.

when i was about 5, and my cousin was 7
we had a nice 600~ sq ft pool house with a glass facade on the side facing the pool and no other windows. i was playing nes with my cousin . all that could really be seen out of them was the pool and the back patio. me and him then saw our of the corner of our eye a full grown wolf run past the glass out of view, at about 20mph. we thought it was super cool, and honestly thought we had both seen the family dog but our eyes played trick on us until we realized it was in the poolhouse with us sleeping. i think we were playing something 'scary' like castlevania. a few mins of talking about what we had seen and we had went back to playing the nes. 10 mins later and my cousin says 'look they're back!'. i turn to my side and there are 5 wolves; 3 grey ones and 2 black ones, standing between the pool and the poolhouse, staring through the glass straight at us. i'm not sure if i was more scared or just in shock, my cousin definitely seemed scared. about a minute after us staring them down for about a minute, the family dog starts barking at them and they run off. me and my cousin then made a beeline to the backdoor and didn't go outside for days. my dad sat on the porch with a gun after for a couple of hours and said he never saw them.

absolute weirdest one and the one i usually tell people about: i was around 10, waiting for the bus to pick me up at about 7:10 am. it was still really dark, must have been winter. my mom or my grandma would always stand outside on the porch to watch me get on the bus when i was younger, and it was usually my mom, but that year they'd thought i was big enough to stay outside alone. for some reason my grandma was outside though.

i remember turning around because i heard my grandma yell 'shoo!' really loudly. that's when i saw it, about 20 feet behind me: a huge grey wolf standing perfectly still staring straight at me. my grandma (she was young still then) ran from the porch down our long driveway towards me and yelled shoo again and it ran off, ironically in the same direction as the ones i'd seen 5 years before; between the pool and the poolhouse.

tl;dr there was a pack of wolves that lived somewhere near our 200 acre farm in rural east texas for about the first 10 years of my life that i had 2 close encounters with. may have been wolfdog/coywolf hybrid caused by my uncles 'pet' full blooded grey wolf mysteriously vanishing a day after my dad caught it playing too roughly with me.

e; fixed some repetitive wording etc, even tho i know its still horrible and i should have wasted the effort properly punctuating even if only one person reads it and finds it amusing :)","1367366575"

Had to sell it 2 years later in the divorce, and after a year of not riding, bought a Honda Sabre 1100 that, when financial woes struck less than 90 days after purchase, I had to resell at a $300 loss.

Two years ago, after saving for SO LONG, I sold every expensive bit of mega computer I'd built for myself back in 2006. I had a 12TB Raid 6 that read and wrote at over 500MB/s, triple-24"" monitor setup, mother of all graphics cards. I chopped it all down, and came out about $1200 ahead. I bought an '83 Yamaha Maxim for $1k, and the other $200 went into tabs, plates, insurance.

I got lucky and a buddy of mine was selling the bike I now own. I sold my Maxim to another friend for the same I paid for it, and he let me pay as I could on my VStar 1100. It took me another 5-6 months to get the additional $1500 owed to him, to him.

Also, twins might seem harder, but once one of them starts to be interested in it the other likely will too.

It's helped me realize how to put my thoughts into words more than once.

As far as doubting new Mega Man releases is concerned, I may be a bit pessimistic, but I feel like Capcom has shelved our beloved blue bomber. They canceled Mega Man Universe and Legends 3. I haven't heard anything about him since Mega Man 10. And if they wait too long, interest will wane. Then they really won't ever publish a new Mega Man game, because Capcom's trend is usually to follow the money trail. 

I don't want him to be shelved forever. Hell, I'd be frothing at the loins **and** mouth if they released an X Collection for 3DS (or Vita! As long as it's a handheld!). Unfortunately, I think that Capcom doesn't see it as a profitable IP anymore.","1367366584"

I'd be the Kindness Killer. I figure if I, for some reason, go absolutely insane and start serial killing, I'll at least have the sense and courtesy to let them die peacefully and not in an immensely menacing and diabolical way. 

Also, it's not exactly an intelligent way to kill in serial fashion as it would present a lot of loose ends, so I'd probably be caught before I caused too much damage. Hopefully they put me in a mental health facility so I can get better though and then work tirelessly in an attempt to make amends to the families.

Also also, it's a quirky and interesting enough plot to at least inspire an awesome movie. 

So...

- Pros: Bound to fail, victims depart peacefully, is still an interesting story.
- Cons: People are dying (but that's a given due to the nature of the question).","1367366590"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Try to get some perspective by looking at it from an evolutionary perspective.  

The purpose of life is to create more life.  Love and attraction are largely based on instinct.  She instinctively wants a strong healthy baby, so she is attracted to physical ""hunter"" types to bang.  After having a baby, she will be attracted to ""protector"" types that will make sure the baby grows up.  

Women are all different, so you are better off going after a woman who is self-aware enough to not be controlled purely by instinct.  She'll still want to drop her panties for (random male celebrity), but won't cuz she knows that sex is better with someone you care about and overall committed relationships make her happiest.  

So, what to do?  
1] Be physically capable.  Can you save your own life in an emergency?  Can you save your girl's life?  Your future kid's?  
2] Enlighten yourself.  Does this girl really deserve you or just holding onto you as a backup mate?  As a friend, does she show interest in your life?  Do you like her just cuz she's hot?  
3] Aim higher.  Don't settle for a pretty face.  This girl does not have a gold plated vagina that is the magical source for the fountain of youth.    Your perfect girl is perfect cuz you accept each other 100%.  The more time you waste whinging over this girl is more time away from future happiness.  ","1367366591"

For example, in one section a side character is suppose to get impregnated via stinger by an outsider. Instead it happened to one of the characters who then changed his class to bard after he was cured. 

Another thing that happened a lot was discussions on how to ethically handle situations. Two were evil and the others were chaotic. The bard was completely good. 

I remember they argued for a good thirty minutes on what to do at a point. And it wasn't bad. They just discussed.

It depends on what you think good is, as well as the person whose foundations are being shaken. True, some people might take the experience the ""wrong"" way and become ""out there"" in a socially damaging way, but for others, a bit of foundation-shaking can be beneficial. As for your closing statement regarding the connection between people with delusions of grandeur and acid/psychedelics, I've found quite the opposite to be true; most of the people I've met who enjoy psychedelics are very down-to-earth and if anything, humbled by their experience rather than deluded because of it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You should read the work of holocaust deniers, their arguments are really poor but it is interesting to see how they put them together.

Generally they latch on to a discrepancy contained in incredibly speculative views of what was going on in Germany during the war at the time- basically conflicting bits of wartime intelligence that made their ways into official reports. The deniers they treat the ones they like as fact and the truth that eventually emerged as a conspiracy.

Basically it is the same trope as Fox news uses: some people say one thing, some people say another. Nobody knows for sure what is true, so one side is just as valid as the other- it is really just your opinion. Repeat. 

Eventually you get to the point where its like ""so we disagree about how things really went. I say it was a soap factory and workers quarters and you say it was a complex where Germans carted in millions of people by rail and murdered them for no good reason during an incredibly resource intensive war? Which is more likely?""

Then they go on to say horrible things about the Jews that seem to indicate they would be down with the holocaust if it started now, undercutting their entire point. Holocaust deniers scare me because one day it will all be an argument in a vacuum like this, a legend retold.","1367366601"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You're dead right about it being a cultural phenomenon!  I took a Sociolinguistics class awhile back, and we learned about something called ""face"" and its two aspects, positive and negative face.  (If I remember correctly, the people who came up with the idea were Brown &amp; Levinson.)  This post ended up being a little long, but bear with me, because it's cool stuff.  It blew my mind when I learned about it, and hopefully it'll help you understand your differences with your girlfriend even better.

So, according to this particular ""politeness theory"", positive face is the ability to be valued as a social entity.  Negative face is the ability to pursue your desires unimpeded.  A lot of times, in social situations, you have to pick one or the other--they directly conflict.  Some cultures value positive face more than negative face, and other cultures value negative face more than positive face.  What's considered rude or polite in a given culture is based on which kind of face the culture values more.  (It can also depend on the situation.)

For example, Italian culture values positive face more than negative face during conversation (and in other situations, too).  So, if you're talking, Italians will interrupt you to demonstrate that they're engaged in the conversation, and thus that they value you as a social person.  For an Italian, *not* interrupting comes across as cold and disengaged, and therefore a little rude.

On the other hand, in many Germanic cultures (and Anglo culture), negative face is more highly valued than positive face.  Thus, when a person's talking, their desire to finish their story unhindered is more important than the need to demonstrate social acceptance and value, so it's considered rude to interrupt.

This flows over into other situations, too.  Think about physical affection--Italians are very physically affectionate.  From an Anglo's point of view, Italians invade your personal space.  But from the Italian cultural point of view, it's more important to demonstrate affection and acceptance than it is to consider that a person might not want to be touched.

You can see the effects of this in some regional cultural differences in the US.  In New York City, with huge Jewish and Italian populations, people's behavior often values positive face over negative face.  (Think of how New Yorkers have no qualms about giving unsolicited advice to complete strangers.)  This is in stark contrast to certain parts of the Midwest, largely settled by Scandinavians and Germans, where a person's ability to be unimpeded by others is held paramount, in terms of what's considered polite behavior.","1367366604"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","&gt;However, if you concede that women were an oppressed class at any point in history (and some of us do) then it stands to reason that young women should be given the opportunity to learn about that.

Actually I wouldn't agree with that at all. Firstly: ""Womanhood"" isn't a class, it's a gender. And that's not just mincing words, gender operates very very differently to class. Secondly: The term ""oppressed"" implies an oppressor. I don't agree that women's issues with their gender role are the result of the actions of men, they're the result of the natural selection of cultural traits. It also makes a mockery of the term when the supposed ""oppressor"" also faced negative consequences as a result of being a member of their group and the ""oppressed"" group also gained privileges as a result of their status.

&gt;The alternative, which is occurring all over the US and has been for a long time, is transformationist feminists reforming text books to be gender symmetrical even where gender symmetry does not exist. Political history text books strive to balance mention of men and women despite that political history is largely a masculine endeavor, for example. 

I'm pretty sure that that's not the only alternative, but I'd agree it's probably a likely thing to happen.","1367366607"

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","I honestly haven't yet really understood this time crystal stuff yet, although when I saw this and realized there had been a back-and-forth on it, I'm re-resolved to get around to understanding it. I think Techercizer's top comment sounds like the right kind of reaction. 

The second part I can address much better. Ever since Ken Wilson introduced the concept of the renormalization group, there are two basic kinds of quantum field theories that we can talk about; those which make sense up to arbitrarily high energy ('renormalizable') and those which break down above some particular energy threshold, and only offer an 'effective' description below that level ('non-renormalizable'). The classic example of the latter is [Fermi's description of the weak force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_theory_of_beta_decay): it describes the weak interaction well below the weak scale (~100 GeV), but its divergences cannot be tamed by renormalization, and we now know this theory is replaced by the current electroweak theory, of which Fermi's theory can be considered a ""low-energy effective description"".

What is often said as ""gravity and quantum mechanics are incompatible"" is based on the observation that gravity is a non-renormalizable field theory. This means it can be treated quantum mechanically at energies below around its characteristic scale, the Planck scale. In the technical details this comes from the fact that there are just too many Feynman diagrams you can draw (infinitely many of them, in fact) involving the metric which correspond to an infinite number of independent parameters, which cannot be determined from the low-energy data alone. Thats why you need a fundamentally new high-energy starting point to *fully* describe quantum gravity. So when I say ""ultraviolet completion"" I mean that set of higher-energy data (hopefully including the new viewpoint which makes sense of them) allowing the full quantum gravity theory to be described consistent with its known low-energy degrees of freedom. In physics, ""ultraviolet"" and ""infrared"" often mean ""high energy"" and ""low energy"" respectively.","1367366607"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","Hi. OP here. Keeping your savings as diamonds is a hell of an example. I've heard of folks who went through the Great Depression doing the same. Most cases are much more pedestrian however.

For example, if you want to be successful, and I mean really really successful in America, you have to be comfortable with white people. To be comfortable with white people, you need to have exposure to the culture of white people -- to peek behind the curtain and see what's up and know their world and feel comfortable with it -- but there are lots of immigrants and children of immigrants and *tons* of black people who never get that exposure.

For many immigrant families, the parents want their children hanging out with their own, dating their own, knowing and respecting their culture. A lot of that is because the parents themselves are afraid to step out of their little bubble. They shelter their children and control their choices because they believe they know what's right for their child.

Of course, they have no idea what is right. They are parenting on auto-pilot: they are just handing to their children what was handed to them. It's always seemed funny to me that we do that, like we're salmon swimming upstream to spawn in the same place we were spawned. We don't know why, but we're compelled to believe our cultural identity is right and everyone else's is wrong (see: ""kids these days have no respect!"").

One interesting part of being the child of an immigrant is the process of picking through your cultural identity. It usually manifests as an identity crisis post-puberty and resolves itself by 30. In the end, you're left with a more robust and secure sense of identity than either your immigrant parents or your friend whose ancestors came over on the Mayflower. Why? Because you're the only one who had to look at two conflicting cultures and decide which parts of each suited you most. Most people never get around to ever questioning those things.","1367366611"
"Adoption","t5_2qr1s","I disagree.

I never regretted placing my son for adoption.  Not once!  I missed him a crippling amount and often wished that I could have been ready to be his mom, but I never had regrets.  I felt totally confident knowing that I had given him the best life with the best parents possible.  I was excruciatingly thorough in my search for adoptive parents, so when the time came, I had no doubts whatsoever that I had made the best decision.  It was by far the hardest thing I've ever done, but also by far the best!

Every birth parent's experience is different!  So you may or may not regret your decision.  I just wanted to let you know that it's not the 'rule' that all birthparents regret their decision, and that if you don't have regrets that you didn't love or care as much about your baby or any nonsense like that!


Now about the Post Adoption Contact Agreement:

Contact agreements differ depending on the state(s) involved.  I know that in Connecticut, the contact agreement is really just an agreement between the two parties saying that they both agree this type of relationship is in the best interest of the child and that they hope for this and that.  While in New York, the post adoption contact agreement is a legally enforceable document.  So say the APs don't hold up their end of the agreement, a court order could force a visit or pictures to be given to the birthparents.  Also, if the birthparents miss two consecutive planned visits without excuse, then the contract is revised and the birthparents can lose their visiting privileges.  So my point is that depending on the state or states, what you ask for in the contact agreement will be different. 

 If it is a state where the post adoption contact agreement is legally enforceable, then you will want to say your minimum number of visits, not maximum!  You can always arrange additional visits (this is something to discuss with potential parents), but you can't decide you want fewer.  The legal agreement outlines that you must have at LEAST x number of visits a year, so to go below that number could instigate legal action -and nobody wants to deal with that kind of mess.  This is why the actual relationship outside of legal documents is so important to an open adoption!!

If it is a state with a non-enforceable contact agreement, then I'm not sure what is usually written in the document.  

Your lawyer or agency will explain everything as it pertains to your case.  My best advice about that is to listen well, read carefully, and don't be afraid to ask tons of questions!  The legal papers can be very long and boring, but they are what dictates your future relationship with your child, so they're important!  Make sure you fully understand and agree with everything!  

I do agree, however, that at any time (before your parental rights are terminated) you can absolutely decide not to place your child!  Even if you've already matched with a couple.

Sorry to write so much!  I'm so grateful that my whole adoption process went so well, that I want to pass along the things I think helped!  Please feel free to PM me about anything!!","1367366611"

1. Eat more. No seriously, eat more. Never be hungry.

2. Lift weights. At least 3 times a week. Otherwise all that eating will just become fat instead of muscle and won't do you any good.

3. Minimize cardio as much as possible. You want those extra calories going to muscle building, not endurance.

4. Protein doesn't make you fat. Eating a lot and not exercising makes you fat.

5. You could take creatine. It'll give you an initial boost of water-weight.

6. Drink whole milk. Replace your water intake with whole milk intake.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Okay I would like to give my synopsis. For reference purposes, to prove I am not just talking out my ass here:

I was taught to box by my mother who was taught by her father and grandfather. One of whom was a **professional boxer**, both of which boxed in the military. (One was in WW1 the other was in WW2) and she is the toughest woman I have ever met in my whole life. She was moved into the men's kickboxing class when she was in the army (scientist) for being to rough on the girls (plenty of which were enlistees and 10 years younger than her). I was also taught to fight by my Vietnam vet father. **I am also a second degree black belt** in Okinawan Isshinryu-ishendo Karate.(Most people just call it Isshinryu) I also do Italian Rapier fencing at college. (Which in my opinion is way less sissy-ish than French Foil fencing bu that is a debate for another day.) If anyone questions this I have at least 3 friends that go to my college that could get on to their reddit accounts (though none of them reddit as much I do) and confirm this, one of which is also a fencer, accomplished martial artist, and the assistant instructor at my college's kick-boxing class. 

Obviously Ali is much bigger than Lee. I think he can also take a great deal more punishment before he starts to get punchdrunk (which really is the end of the fight when people are unarmed). But Lee is much faster and I think he can do much more variety with his attacks, is far better with weapons and kicks (though weapons are prohibited) and knows many more pressure points. Though I admit pressure points won't make a great deal of difference in a fight between titans like these. 

I think 1-3 of Ali's punches would get Lee sufficiently punchdrunk. I firmly believe that if this happens Lee has only like a 1% chance of winning if he is punchdrunk and Ali is not. Now Ali has a secret weapon though, his Anchor-Punch! One of these landed WELL on Lee would instantly leave Lee punchdrunk-maybe even just plain out cold! And no matter who they are an unconscious opponent is fish food for anybody. Now Lee has a lot more to distance to cover. It would require many more punches on Lee's behalf to down Ali. Luckily Lee wouldn't just box him. In a boxing match Lee wouldn't stand a chance. But this is not boxing match. Kicking, killing, kneeing, headbutting, elbowing, biting, heart-stoppers, concussion strikes all of it is allowed. Eyes, balls, knees, kiddnies, temples, throat, stomach, joints, pressure points, spine, if you can hit it, it's a target. This is the difference between sport, and deadly combat.

This is where Lee's speed comes into play, he doesn't block nearly as much as he parrys and dodges, he would not allow himself to get hit by Ali, ESP by an anchor-punch. He would be much faster than Ali. He COULD go around behind and try to go for ribs, kiddnies, and spine. But I think it is much more likely he would target genitals and knees. Ali has the reach advantage WITH THEIR ARMS. But not if Lee is kicking. The length of his legs are longer than what his punches would be, but more importantly his kicks has superior speed, superior angle, and are less visible, esp to a boxer. Ali is an amazing boxer, but even he is literally crippled if you break his knee away from him. Now you might wonder, ""how hard is it to break a knee?"" if you don't know what your doing it *can* be difficult. But to someone that is trained for a little while on how to, snapping a knee with a kick is easy from the front or either side. and that is why I think Lee would win.

**TL;DR: Lee loses in a boxing match, but in a street fight would snap Ali's knee. Lee wins.**","1367366613"

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","That's explained by the modal operators. If it's better to be x than y or v as both y and v have certain properties it would be better to have certain properties. Modal logic uses two added truth qualifiers. Something can be true (T), something can be possibly true (◊T), and something can be necessarily true (□T). The diamond denotes possibility and the box denotes necessity. Modal logics use a semantic called ""possible worlds."" A possible world is a description of the way reality might be, kind of like a hypothetical situation. The actual world is a possible world where the entire description is true. In other words, it is a description of the way reality is.

There are different systems of modal logic, where the axioms are different. There are also different modal logics, where the application is different. The term possible and the term necessary have different meanings in different modal logics.

As I explained in the conjectured axiomatic formulation, it's better to be necessary than contingent, it's better to be omnipotent as such constitutes ultimate metaphysical necessity. An omnipotent being would have to be maximally great because if it's not it is 'destructible' (corruptible) and would therefore not have the property of existing necessary. Moral perfection, omniscience, omnipresence follow necessarily as it consitutes more power to be omniscient than ignorant. An omnipotent being is more powerful if it's omniscient. To be omniscient it must exist everywhere, to be knowledgable of everything, etc.","1367366615"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Taking out loans to pay for college is not ""nonsensical"", it's a statistically great choice to improve your income and pays for itself multiple times over.  The problem is when people decide to go to a school that costs an astounding 125K and leave without the grades or the major to get a job to repay that debt.

Interest on loans is a very costly thing.  It exists for many reasons, but anyone taking out that much money should know the potential to get buried in debt.  If interest didn't work like it did, everyone would take 100's of thousands of dollars out.

Again, you say debt slavery.  Was he physically unable to escape from his job?  Obviously not, he left.  Could he change his job to another?  Absolutely.  He did.  Was he unable to move up the corporate ladder, making more money every year until he could pay those debts?  Considering he is making 100K now, I would assume so.  So how is he a slave?  Again, you're acting like simply being poor or being in debt is being a slave.  

My brother spends his entire paycheck on rent, food, car expenses, and bills.  He tells me he has less than $1,000 saved up.  Is he a slave for working and not gaining anything from it?  He couldn't travel to Europe, much less get a job there, or pay for a 125K education.  He is in a worse position than OP.  So is he even more of a slave in your eyes?

1) At a camp for a school trip, a place called Liberty Lake.  Months before we ever even received the permission slips to take home I had a dream where I was standing on a hill and overlooking a large lake where all my friends were kayaking.  A gust of wind against my face, and someone calling my name.  Once we got to Liberty Lake, I found myself getting deja vu while standing on this stupid hill in front of the lake.  Then I felt the wind and heard my name and it hit me, I had been there before months prior.  Freaked me out.

2)  A conversation with my girlfriend regarding her medicine that she takes in shot form.  I was asking  her about when the next two boxes would be coming in.  The problem with this one is that I can't tell whether that scenario is happening in real life, or if its just deja vu. After I realize I've had this convo with her before, I always mention it to her and she says that we've never had this particular convo before.  And then I mention that I've just had deja vu, but it isn't the first time.   Is it possible to have deja vu of deja vu?  Is it possible to have deja vu of something that hasn't happened yet?

While figuring buoyancy of a balloon in air (principle is kind of the same and uses the same equation), you use the density of air without consideration for the various gases that it is made of. Also, lava/magma is much more dense than water and I would assume obsidian is actually less dense that it, in which case buoyancy would be very easy for it.

The problem is that you are blaming God and shaking your proverbial fist. That is the only barrier. Once you realize that God is the judge and that you don't deserve His blessing, then you can see past that to what God has done for you and how much He loves you.

You don't believe of your own. Faith is itself a gift given by grace. God owes no man forgiveness and He owes no man repentance. But God is a merciful and giving God, and the Bible says He will not reject anyone.

Forget what religion tells you. Even the best out there is wrong. Read the Bible, and and pray that God reveals Himself to you, not as a demand as if the omnipotent Creator of all things owes you something, but as one who seeks a favor. If the only way you will accept God is for Him to worship you, He will not do that, but He will not reject you as His child if you are willing.

I know. I am a skeptic. There is really nothing else in the world I can believe nor could I believe. God did not deny me faith, and with all I did to deserve damnation rather than love, He loved me.","1367366630"

"CODGhosts","t5_2wp1x","Timely developer patches and support. IW has, historically, responded slowly (if ever) to game issues. 

Simplicity. COD4 was great because it had depth but not too many things to choose. The single deadly chopper was fearsome and exciting; predators and one of the other million killstreaks going off now are boring and make the game far too ridiculous.

Removal of any benefits to dying.

More guns. Seriously, why are there so few?

Return to headshot based camo.

Halo 2-esque online stat support. It's been over a decade, lets get with the times. (lol elite)

Stop crushing UAV-Jammer perks. Congratulations on your 3 kills, but I dont think you deserve to let your entire team know where all enemies are for 30 seconds at a time. UAVs have become increasingly more powerful which severely hinders the game. Theres a reason wallhacks are frowned upon.

I sent an email to Robert Bowling for my MW3 hopes (Hardcore TDM Perspective):

**Bolded has been since added into MW3**

- G3. Not enough semi-automatic guns in MW2
- Black Ops or better player stats
 - Online support like Halo 2/3 would be great 
 - Lobby leader boards are fantastic
- Teammates in green boxes (as enemies are shown in red) during kill streaks
- **Gun sights centered correctly**
 - FAL was messed up, to name one.
- Removal of all multiple life perks:
 - Last/Final/Second Stand/Chance
 - Martyrdom
 - Juggernaut/Painkiller
- Mute or drastically lower the volume for teammate tactical insertions
- Don't let players' feet clip through walls
- Different options for teammate name hover when they're in focus
 - Full/Abbreviated
- **One Man Army removal**
- Secondary tube removal
- **Anti-modding tools**
 - **Wallhacks**
- Accurate portrayal of airstrike area before called in
- Vote kick system for teamkillers
 - Black Ops' system was too strict.
 - X amount of votes (victim gets 1 vote) removes a player
- **Removal of off-the-spawn tubing**
- Tubing needs a re-haul (or complete removal)
 - Inability to sprint with the tube out
 - Inability to shoot and move
 - Slower tube fire
 - Take up a perk slot like COD 4
- **COD 4: MW sniping**
 - Im indifferent towards quick-scoping, but Black Ops' sniping system was atrocious
- **Map voting**
 - **2 new map options (no voting for the map that just got finished)**
 - 2 new map options + random
- **COD 4 leveling system was great. Black Ops' point system was misguided.**
- **Sounds in MW2 were the most crisp out of any COD game to date. Keep it up.**
- Glass breaking needs reworking
 - Idea: Allow glass breaking the way it currently is in MW2, and allow us to hold 'melee' for 3 seconds near class for player to clear out all tiny glass shards connected to window
- **Killstreak cycling**
 - **Cycle through earned killstreaks instead of most recent first**
 - Option to queue a killstreak until the similar one is done
  - Ex: UAV is currently out with 15 seconds left, player can call in a UAV to speed it up, or queue the UAV to come in when the current one is down (in 15 seconds)
  - Priority determined by time called in
- Dedicated servers
- Map design was great throughout COD2/MW/MW2, minus a few exceptions (Bog, Creek, a few others)
 - Do not fall into the Black Ops' design of:
 - Arbitrary building placement
 - Complexity for the sake of complexity
 - No map game play, thus no team game play
 - No important choke points or important landmarks to hold
- Spawning. Spawn points were an issue in early COD 4, until fixed. Keep an eye out for them. Black Ops continues to show their inferiority in this aspect.
- Aesthetic upgrades for more kills. Im not too worried about this, but something to earn for players who show mastery over their weapon, i.e. 250 of task X is not enough for a year+ of game play.
- Black Ops' ideas were horrible. Nobody needs a skull red dot sight.","1367366632"

I know it can seem sometimes that if people are not talking to you about how they feel that they are somehow trying to cut you out. It's likely though that the very fact that you are all there for her means a lot, even if she doesn't break down how she's feeling to you.

The sexes are different in mammals, why wouldn't you expect this difference to show up in our psyche somewhere?  Until we get to the BNW future, that is, where reproduction is gross and breasts aren't a symbol of a woman's nurturing nature...

You can say ""barf, nurturing, ugh"", BUT... keep in mind that your hamburger comes from animal that you had to historically raise, kill, and see die.  What we see is a nice clean little plastic package.  We are super disconnected from the life cycle in our modern world, which includes disconnecting sexuality from reproduction, which has changed how we see women, and how women see themselves.  That's what breasts used to do.... not sell bras for La Senza.

This is of course open to debate, and most North American cafes hedge that towards larger to cater to the demands of the market they're in, but it's a good guideline.  

To give you a better idea what that 25ml measurement means, that is ~.85 of a fluid ounce.  A one-ounce shot glass, if filled, would be oversize by their standards and roughly typical of a North American shot.

Plus, even in this solution, when the firearms are retired they will be sold to the public, as is standard procedure for retired police firearms. Agencies also have standardized armaments, and the chance that there are a large amount of perfectly functional gun of the exact same model and caliber is extremely, extremely small.

So, even if the solution you suggested is used, There are still probably at the minimum about 90% of the original guns left that need a home, after all the ones that are illegal, in too poor condition, or were used in a crime are taken out. As the law mentioned in the article states, it is illegal for police to destroy objects that are seized, and they are to be offered for sale to the public, usually in an auction format. All that this new law does is close the ""gun turn-in loophole"" that the government has been exploiting in order to pay a humorously small amount for guns, which they then destroy due to them being turned in ""voluntarily"" and not seized.","1367366638"

And I don't think that it's ""our culture's perception of math""; it's just the way *some* people might feel. To a lot of people, math is boring, and I can understand why they would think so.

I think the bigger problem is how judgemental some math people can be about people who aren't interested in math. In my experience, it's mostly overzealous math majors still in school (undergrad or grad) who exhibit that behavior - I think professors who've been teaching for a while develop a greater appreciation of other subjects, from what I've seen.","1367366640"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Okay.

I was born in Arizona and I have some scary first memories of the house we lived in. My older sister wouldn't go to the bathroom by herself because you could see the outline of people in the doorway. 

My older sister was hit by a truck when she was 8 and was in a coma for three months and then a full body cast for a really long time, a year maybe. When she woke up from her coma some lady at the children's hospital stopped by and gave her a teddy bear that looked like a monkey. We called it a monkey bear. My sister couldn't talk or move and was on a lot of morphine but her eyes would flick over to the bear and then panic. My mom attributed it to the drugs but then she thought she could see it move sometimes. She shrugged it off. When my sister came home from the hospital the monkey bear went in me and my little sisters bedroom and I swear to god I have a vivid memory of this thing walking around on the dresser. It had those moveable arms and legs. 

My mom went outside to hang laundry and the entire house locked. Every window, both doors. The couch was somehow in front of the door. She had to sit outside in Arizona heat and wait for my dad to get back and break into the house. 

There was a framed Broncos poster hanging up above the couch. One day, my dad came down and it was gone. The frame was behind the sofa, but the poster was on the floor in the kitchen. 

Every picture we have from that house no matter what camera it was taken on is tinted yellow.

My mom has experienced stuff outside that house. She had a messed up childhood and her ""dad"", who molested her, practiced witchcraft. I don't believe in witches but I can't help but think he haunts her, in more ways than one. ","1367366644"

This is why liberty city in 3 and 4 are totally different, ans why San Andreas will be totally different in gta5. Key areas like vine wood, bone county etc will still be in the game, but you won't see any of the old character, because they don't exist.

One of the advantages Sony has over Microsoft still in gaming is that because they have been part of the industry so long they have established a much bigger place as a publisher. Microsoft just lacks in this area, they have only a few franchises that are successful. If you want the Ps3 exclusives you have to buy a Ps3. That's a huge part of Sony's selling point for their console, that they have a lot of great exclusive titles.

As for CoD, 99% not happening. This is an entirely bullshit article made by a random small news site. They are fishing for hits. Activision makes money selling on Ps3, they have made PC CoD for years and very few people play it. Even if that was the case Sony would never let that happen and I don't see Microsoft being willing to cover the costs for Activision to drop PC and Ps4 releases + extra, in order to have exclusive rights.","1367366650"

I have not tried the bras mentioned, but the Elomi Paloma works well for me (I think more due to fabric than cut, maybe?), and the Chantelle Rive Gauche 3281.

Unfortunately my favorite bra currently comes from Change Lingerie (in Canada - I am an expat who lives near the border). So, it's not really one I can reasonably suggest. Unfortunately, it has taken a fair amount of trial and error to find bras that don't do this, and seems to be a persistent problem. For me, it doesn't seem to correlate with wire width, or even particular style of bra, except that balconnets seem to be the worst offenders. Good luck :)","1367366650"

Every season so far since Moffat's taken over people have complained it's too serialized and that they miss the monster-of-the-week format, while others think the show is the best it's been in a while. So now he's trying to cater to both audiences and what do we get? A slow season filled with monster of the week episodes with a main arc that maybe gets one line of dialogue per episode (if it's lucky).

With serialization, I feel like the show is more urgent, I have more of a reason to tune in every week because any episode could possibly reveal more about the mysteries happening that season. With monster of the week I just think ""Oh, they're fighting x villain next week...I guess I'll watch"". Some people like this format, but I think after two series of heavier serialization, series 7 feels slow due to a lack of it. Just my two cents.","1367366656"

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

As far as budget cuts and educating students, there were years where all we had were textbooks and a chalkboard and we got along just fine.  There were also years where there was more money to fund a smart whiteboard and that was a really cool time saver and it also helped the kids with visualizing.  

Probably the coolest thing I did when I taught was to take my geometry classes on a field trip where we applied things from a lot of the chapters to real world problems.  THAT was pretty cool and without funding it wouldn't have been possible.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","They don't want you not dying forever with the HP, and more importantly, the HP Regen.

One thing you realize is that Warmogs / Overlord's bloodmail is not a simple ""BIG HP"" item: it's a big HP item as a regeneration option. It's clear to see that massive HP regen conflicts with the spirit of ARAM. That's why flask is also not allowed in ARAM. 

Warmogs does this by doing the % HP regen: you get to stay back and not do anything, and then come back to full HP without doing much. It's almost as if you're laning against a Garen. Overlord's Bloodmail is actually worse when it comes to ARAM. It's not too difficult to rack up assists by spamming ranged AOE pokes or whatever you have. Each assist will give you an immediate 200 HP heal without ever putting you in immediate danger.

Just get Rylais + Liandrys for AP HP Champions, and Frozen Mallet for AD HP Champions. They're enough for what they do, with 700-800 HP. You also get utility and damage on your side. If you /must/ only have 1 hp item for APs, something like RoA would work, too. ","1367366665"

Solidworks, along with most of the other new software, is pretty good about handling extra constraints.

The fact that solidworks (or whatever) can figure this out and not explode is pretty handy.

Vick wasn't playing well at the start of the season when everybody was healthy, and looked absolutely lost the rest of the season.  He was a dropped interception away from turning in an absolute stinker against the Browns, and was just eking out ugly wins (though an ugly win against Bmore still counts for something) before it all went downhill.

If he gets out on the field and looks dynamite in Kelly's offense, great, maybe franchise tag him for one more year if he puts up stellar numbers.  I was a huge Vick supporter this time in 2012, but now he's old, brittle, and has unfortunately taken one too many shots to the head.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","1. Because it is a CONTRACT POSITION and there has been no stipulation that it is a W2. Even using W2 figures for taxes you still can't live on this salary.  Let's use YOUR figures for the sake of argument.

2.  Average cost of apartment is $686 according to apartmentratings.com.  Utilities cost is $218 per month according to Bundle.  I won't even add in Internet service.

3.  I did read the law.  Again, you need to figure in the cost of health insurance -- WHETHER YOU ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE IT OR NOT. Again, if you can show me, specifically, where Obamacare says the maximum you will pay is $1094 a year, I'll use that figure. But let's just skip health insurance or use your figure because you're hung up on it.  I don't know where you're going to the doctor, it must be in Fantasyland.

4. According to CNT.org, the average cost of transportation in in Syracuse of $14,000 a year.  Your $200 a month is way, way off. Let's say it's half the average.  Let's use $700.

So let's review:

Starting monthly wage is $2080.  

Using your tax figure -- not mine, we deduct taxes and get $1855. This is according to online hourly salary calculators.

Less apartment and utilities gives us $951.  Skipping health insurance for now, let's go to transportation. HALF the average.  That leaves us with $251.  

Now, let's deduct your 4% for 401K contribution, which gives us $167.  Now we have food, you estimated it at $200 a month. I guess we don't go out to eat or drink booze. We are now in the hole -$33.

We now have a negative balance for spending money, internet access, savings, emergencies, health care, loan repayments and everything else.

But hey, I know you're going to use your magical budgeting skills and decide your rent is way too high. Let's assume you got a roommate because you want to pay back your education loans.  We can add back in $452 less the $300 loan repayment which leaves us with $119. 

And let's use your figure for health insurance, just for grins.  That leaves us a whopping $28 per month for Internet access, going to the dentist, the eye doctor, travel, a cell phone, cable television, entertainment, emergencies, dating or even Netflix and Hulu.

its mental gymnastics which seeks to vilify the people they've killed to ease their conscious and to fit within their religious laws.

some americans do the same thing, for example, when that pulitzer prize winning arabic journalist and his crew were executed by apache gunships because from a mile away the camera looked like a weapon on a 2 inch screen. there was no public outrage at the death of 12 innocent men, the sentiment was, ""they shouldnt have been gathered together like that, it was their fault!"".

As a ganking item, the slow on it is nearly as effective for your team as a well used force staff (though significantly easier to use well). As you said you can use it while still smoked to cover even more ground.

As a teamfight item, yes the slow will help make a melee carry kiteable, but more it can be cast on any hero that needs to be careful about their positions in order to muck up the enemy team synergy. For example it makes Weaver's invis almost not matter at all and if Weaver doesn't ult out of it it makes the positioning power of the ult much weaker to the point that he is often still stuck somewhere inside the fight (and if he does ult, then the ult is on cooldown so he is easier to kill if you can catch him).

If you don't have an LTO-5 drive/robot the Dell PV-124T is around $7k and holds 16 tapes.

Irealized it as i punched it in but quickly pawned it off assuming I had the right spelling and remained proffesional. Later the woman thought I was trying to call her a cunt and being a smart ass.

First off, nobody promised anybody a live album. Streetlight said that, as a token of gratitude for the fan's patience in waiting for the record, the band will provide all pre-order packages with a live ep. 

However, if you still believe that someone stating a claim is a promise, you're being silly. 


So, I digress. You need to speak for your self, because I, for one, have not got **my** hopes up. Yes, I did not get my hopes up. Streetlight can't get anyone's hopes up but their own, I have no idea what the fuck you're talking about, this is ridiculous!

How is it their weakest? This album is very nice. The lyrics are as good as ever, and they speak volumes when you pay attention to them. 

They've decided to stop touring full time. Not once was a hiatus mentioned. You blind?

"videos","t5_2qh1e","My experience was horrifying and it literally shook me to the core of my being. I was in my friends living room with two or three of my close buds and a bong with a big bowl of salvia. One of my friends Charlie had done a big bong hit of it earlier and he kind of just sat there with this glazed look on his face for 7-8 minutes and just wriggled around, but seemed okay, so I decided I would do the same thing and hope to have a similar decent experience. Oh, how wrong I was.

I packed the bowl to the brim, which looking back was probably not the best idea, and just ripped that little monster and took it all in one big inhalation. I held it in for about 10 minutes, felt a bit tingly, and literally the moment I exhaled, I left our observable universe. I dont remember anything other than; being on the wooden chair I was sitting on in my friend house, complete and utter blackness around me (I open water scuba dive, and the feeling you get when you're halfway down doing a night dive in 60-70 feet water was very similar), and in front of me was an empty picture frame.  I sat there for what seemed like forever (it was about three minutes according to my friends) staring at that picture frame, and through it and into the darkness. 

I was knocked out of my chair by something and I was sent headfirst into the picture frame. I then spent the next few minutes crawling through an almost endless stack of picture frames which each contained a different memory from childhood to my then 18 year old self. I relived each of the memories as I desperately crawled through them. I felt horribly helpless and very much scared. At the end I fell through the last picture frame and landed in the middle of my friends living room, back in ""reality"", laying down on the ground next to a fallen glass table (I had stood up, turned around, and sat on this glass table and caused everything to fall off and I just started crawling around apparently). 

I don't really comment much and my story may be riddled with errors, but yeah, salvia fucking blows.

Everybody should take a tab of acid at least once in their first 20 years on this planet.

""Those conceptions are hard earned and serve as the foundation of your higher self, one rooted in reality and not confusion""

Well sir, and I only wish to have a discussion here-not an argument-what makes you believe that the sober reality we have experienced for the first (lets just keep the example of 20 years) is not some concoction of confused chunks of experiences and biases passed onto us from those we trusted when we were too young and naive to question and decipher thru reasoning? 

Acid allowed me to peak out from under the blindfold and see life in a harmonizing, natural perspective. 

*Note* I had been going thru a spiritual evolution for a year or two leading up to my acid trip. The acid trip merely had propelling effect. It was the catalyst to my current state as a human that I find to be the happiest of my life.","1367366690"

So I called the county court to find out what I'm meant to do if I miss the court date. ""Oh baby, there's a warrant out for your arrest, you gotta turn yourself in.""
Well, no shit.
So I get my friend to take me to the local station to turn myself in at the local station as county clerk instructed, and I really had to push to get arrested, they were not bothered and couldn't seem to find the warrant.  I didn't want to get into more trouble, responsible citizen that I am, so I calmly waited until they could find the relevant warrant and book me.  And what a blast!  I got mug shots, they let me handcuff myself to the wall fingerprints, I was stoked to see the process in action, and the officers were super friendly.  And as you do, they set up a police record for you, at the time (holy shit more than a decade ago) it was one copy for county records, one for state, and one federal for the FBI- but now I think that's Department of Homeland Sec. Anyway, the officer's asking me all kinds of detailed questions, I guess which would all be useful leads to catch me if I turn out to be a criminal later, all about family friends, jobs, and I'm right over his shoulder watching him peck my answers into this archaic crappy DOS-looking system.  He's running through a load of questions about my job and the previous 10 questions or so had all been dropdown lists, and he asked for job sector or something, and trying ever to be helpful, I said ""I dunno, I'm just a copy boy, so probably you can put that under customer service or maybe printing if they have it.."" and as I'm watching, he just types in COPY BOY in the field.  And I'm like ""woah woah woah, if you're going to be clandestine about that, you make that COPY SHAMAN!"" And so he did.

The sad fact about the rest of their colonial history is that they more or less went for developing nations with large national identity that weren't suitable for colonisation, much less annexation. Korea being the start of this trend, and something they could not turn back from thanks to rising militarism. 

Hawaii was a perfect colony. Small population, lack of interest in national identity (as was evident). I think Japan would have saved the iron the fist.

"Planetside","t5_2s48x","Let me look at my ideas file, under Infiltrator (and relevant generics)...

**One-Button Interaction** - Toggleable option. When enabled, Hacking, compromising, stabilizing etc. will continue as long as player is in range, no need to keep the key held down for longer than a second.

**Speed vs. Safety Hacking** - When hacking(/compromising/stabilizing/etc), the speed is reduced to 75% if the object is in your side arcs, 50% if in your rear arc. Speed is further halved if you are not stationary (75% if crouch walking, 0% if jumping). If interrupted, your hack (etc.) reverts at 200% speed rather than instantly.

**Better Hacking Feedback** - Add an audio indicator to better show hacking (etc.) progress and speed. Right now, you don’t even know it started working until the prompt shows up.

**Infiltrator: New Passive: Strategic Stealth** - (Free) When calculating enemy activity within a territory, Infiltrators are not counted - a territory with a platoon of Infiltrators in it will read as No Activity.

**Infiltrator: New Ability: Wallhack Module** - For those Infiltrators who dare give up their cloaks, an offensive option - once active, it shows the outlines of enemies through walls and other obstructions within a limited range. Range cannot be upgraded, ranks increase uptime instead. Cannot shoot while active, but can spot. Range gets multiplied by weapon’s scope magnification if you zoom in, at the cost of no peripheral vision and some delay as the zoom adjusts.

**Infiltrator: Advanced Terminal Hacking: Vehicle Sabotage** - Requires three ranks of Advanced Terminal Hacking (81 certs). Uncloaked infiltrator may walk up to enemy vehicle and receive a “Hold E to Sabotage” prompt. Vehicle can be occupied, but crew might hear the fairly quiet digital noise. Sabotage lasts until triggered and is otherwise undetectable, unless a friendly infiltrator with at least Advenced Terminal Hacking rank four (181 certs) walks up to it and receives a “Press E to enter / Hold E to remove Sabotage” prompt.

Once triggered, Sabotage effects last 5-7 seconds (depending on rank of Advanced Terminal Hacking). Effects are as follows: Cannot leave or enter vehicle (unless rumble seat or Flash). Cannot switch seats. Cannot be spawned on (AMS Sunderer). Turrets locked, cannot turn. Weapons cannot fire, stop reloading. Controls locked to at time of trigger. Throttle instantly to 0, unless was using afterburner at time of trigger, then afterburn until empty and then throttle to 0. Sabotage VFX similar to EMP grenade detonation, then arcing electricity for duration. Nicely scrambled HUD for the crew. Sabotaged MANA turrets explode like a prox mine.

What triggers the sabotage? For deployed vehicles, trying to undeploy (those poor, poor fools trying to run). For undeployed Sunderers and Galaxies, a passenger trying to exit. For other undeployed vehicles, trying to fire a major weapon (any but tank secondary, liberator nose or tail). Note that triggering action fails.

Successful sabotage awards XP equal to a successful turret hack, with a second such gift when it’s triggered. Additionally, for purposes of kill assists, you count as if you dealt damage equal to all the damage the vehicle takes for the duration of the Sabotage, plus three seconds after. Lastly, if the vehicle dies as a suicide within that period, you are declared as the killer (and, if the vehicle took no other damage, get the Cut The Brakes achievement)

**Infiltrator Advanced Terminal Hacking: Vehicle Jacking** - Requires maxed Advanced Terminal Hacking (681 certs). Yes, it’s exactly what you think it is. Once you sabotage an unoccupied vehicle, you can try and jack it. This immediately triggers the sabotage (which lasts until you stop or finish) and alerts the vehicle’s owner, though they cannot deconstruct the vehicle, as the button is all scrambled (if they try and pull a new one, the old vehicle becomes unowned and will despawn in 5 minutes). If nobody interrupts the lengthy hack (20-30s?), the vehicle becomes yours. It retains all upgrades, ammo, and camo, though loses the sabotage and the color scheme. And yes, you can jack enemy MBTs and ESFs who become black and red / blue and gold / gray and cyan as appropriate. Any previous vehicle you owned is deconstructed. This is not meant to be practical, instead, it’s meant to provide a fun thing to do when it works. There ought be an achievement for scoring a kill on somebody with their own vehicle. One more thing - due to balance, deployed AMS Sunderers cannot be jacked because of Reasons.

**New Weapon: Anti-Materiel Rifles** - Anti-armor brothers of bolt action sniper rifles. They don’t deal more damage to infantry than normal bolt-actions, but they do deal high damage to MAX suits and light vehicles, and can damage armored vehicles (not very much, but they can). In addition, a hit on the canopy of a non-tank vehicle with sufficiently low health (for example, below 75-50% for an ESF, below 10% for a Sunderer, etc) kills the pilot. The downsides are a 40% smaller clip and ammo pool, slower reload and refire, slower and heavier bullets, and if it has empire variants, pre-fire delay for the Vanu.","1367366697"

You're right a lot has changed since then, including a lot of people outgrowing of this (and every other) religion because the morals that the religions leader preached turned out to be immoral after all.

Muhammed was not an absolutely moral man, he was a pedophile and now we are stuck with the remnants of his sick religion.

He was 50 years old when he had sex with 9 year old Aisha. You know what that means?

&gt;No, we don't vote directly on every single issue....but we elect the people who do vote on those issues and we make our views known to them. If we don't approve of what they are doing, we take them out of office via elections

Exactly my point. Perhaps we've been talking past each other. 

&gt;It is majority rule, whether Madison wanted it or not.

It would be a lot closer to it but for the form of government, the founding documents and the split powers.

I never said they don't or shouldn't look at polls. I raised the question as to whether a policy's merits should be judged on it's popularity alone.

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","First off, thanks for the response! I definitely see where your coming from, but I have a few points to bring up.

&gt;While there would be the same reasoning behind using the term ""girlish"" instead of ""boyish,"" I'm guessing those with a rectangle body type wouldn't find it any less offensive (as it still basically refers to a pre-pubescent body type).

my problem with the word isn't that it makes me sound younger. my problem is that it continues to equate ""not having boobs"" with masculinity. however, since we're on the subject, the idea that a rectangle body is prepubescent is patiently untrue. Not many girls or boys are 5'9"" with pubic hair and a decent muscle tone. Secondary sex characteristics include more than hips and boobs.

&gt;No one calling your body type ""boyish"" is intending to call your gender identity into question - it's simply a remark upon the fact that your figure is not womanly (please note the distinction between a womanly body and a woman's body.)

According to wikipedia, (and further from MacCormick, 2005) 46% of women are a rectangle body shape. If a ""boyish"" figure is not womanly, a plurality of women are, in fact, not womenly. 

As for the distinction between a woman's body and womanliness, I see what you're saying but I think it's ultimately sort of arbitrary. I'm not a woman because of my hips or lack thereof. I'm a woman because I feel womanly. If I didn't feel womanly, I probably wouldn't want to be a woman. I can't imagine that for a transgirl there's much difference between hearing ""you look like a boy"" and ""you look boyish"". 

&gt;What I mean to say is, while I understand how it can be offensive, I think the intent of it as a descriptor is rarely to offend. Obviously it can be difficult to discern tone over the Internet, using it in the sense of, ""x, y, and z tend to work well on boyish figures"" is very different from, ""you look like a man.""

When people on the internet use the term boyish, I don't think they're being intentionally malicious. in fact, I think the majority of people don't think about the term at all. Which is exactly why I brought it up. The words we use influence the way we categorize and perceive the world. Fashion can reiterate problematic ideas about women's value and our bodies, or it can refute them. I would rather see this subreddit do the latter.","1367366711"

Convicting someone doesn't make the rape go away, so there's no point comparing the two directly (though if you really want to argue, a lot of people, me included, would pick rape over an extended prison sentence).

In other words, if a crime (rape) doesn't get reported, the worst that happens is that a criminal goes free, which isn't the end of the world. If someone gets wrongly convicted, the end result is a person actually being harmed, which is far worse than a guilty person going free.

The only reason Verizon's behavior here is up for review is because there are unusual openness requirements on Block C, which exist because Google bidded up the price of the block by a few billion dollars to force the rules to go into effect.

No other carrier has to live to these standards, be they a big 4, MVNO, or otherwise.  If AT&amp;T or T-Mobile blocked Google Wallet on their network, then that would be that (though it would be quite hard for them to do so since GSM phones are SIM based).  Sprint could do the same thing quite easily.

Penalties for violation of the openness requirement are well-known to begin with.  You want the FCC to have the arbitrary ability to enforce any penalty they want, even penalties outside of the scope of law or the FCC's domain?

Example: You have $1M in your accounts, $500K in stocks in your taxable account, $500K in bonds in your 401K.  The market tanks! You now have $250K in stocks in taxable accounts, $500K in bonds in the 401K.  You now need to rebalance to $375K of each.  You sell $125K worth of bonds in your 401K and buy $125K of stocks in the 401K.

Let's say the reverse happens and you've got $750K in stocks, $500K in bonds.  In practice the stock market increases can usually be offset by your draw down, but you can still rebalance.  You'd need $625K of each so you'll sell $125K of stocks and buy $125K of bonds in your taxable account.  There's some tax bite, but it's not nearly as bad as holding the bonds in your taxable account.

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Practice makes perfect, if it was your first time you'll get better the more you have sex, some guys can last ages on their first go and then be surprised later on when they're quick. Other guys build up their stamina, can take anywhere from 10-21 attempts at sex to understand your timing. Best advice is don't be anxious about it, realise it's normal, realise that in time you'll become better with practice. My first five-ten times were quick, now having been practiced and in a steady relationship I generally last anywhere from 5minutes to 1 hour+, depending on the situation. Always be a gentleman and make the girl cum (ask her how she makes herself cum and do variations of that for her), she'll come back for more even if it is short! 

Depending on how quick you are, just before you know that you're going to be coming change position so it gives you a quick break and then you can generally keep going for a while! Again, change into another position when the feeling arises.  Hope this helps! Best advice I can give is, don't worry, have fun! Enjoy the practicing! If you're confident with the girl just explain the situation that you're new to this, that you find her really hot and that it might take a bit of practicing at sex until you're lasting longer, if she's a nice girl she'll understand and it will remove some of your anxiety! :) ","1367366717"

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","Once you come to the correct conclusion that the Scripture was compiled by the Catholic Church in the early 4th century, you will understand how pointless it is to use Scripture to point out what you think are errors in Catholic teaching and practice.

It is NOT that Scripture was written, the Catholic Church tried to figure out what the text meant, and they came up with ideas like Communion and Confession.  The correct way of seeing it is to realize the Catholic Church was practicing Confession and Communion from the earliest of Christian history, then decided it would be a good idea to compile writings that gave descriptions of topics consistent with their practice, and that is what is the Sripture.

So if you want to know what the Scripture means, the Catholic Church has the authority to tell you.  No one else.

It is not possible to use Scripture to disprove the Holy Catholic Church, as She is the Sripture's author.  There is no inconsistency.  Thinking otherwise is an unfortunate consequence of Protestant teaching.","1367366722"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","One day, when I was about 20 years old, I was in my bedroom at my parents' house grabbing a pair of fresh boxers/underwear to take to the shower and wear after. It was about noon time as I've just woken up (don't judge me, I had a class around 3pm). The only ones in the house were my mom in her room and me in mine. I was reaching down to grab my boxers from the cabinet when I heard from behind me a man's voice say shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP! Went from a whisper escalating to shouting.

I still remember feeling the breath touching the back of my neck, making my neck hairs shoot up. I sloooowly turned around, anticipating a mental intruder to be standing behind me. When I realized there was no one in the room with me, I immediately yelled for my mom. I was terrified and yes I needed mommy's protection at the age of 20 years old. 

I ran to her room and found her putting on make up to go out. I didn't want to sound crazy and make a scene so I just chilled in her room, acting like I just wanted to spend time with her. After a few minutes, I mustered up the courage to explore the rest of my house. I searched for the intruder everywhere but couldnt find anything out of place.

I've never been so scared in my life in broad daylight.

TL:DR Someone/thing screamed ""shut up, Shut Up, SHUT UP!!"" at the back of my neck. Ran to mommy for help.","1367366722"

Truth is, you may be fine to drive fast. But I don't know that and no other driver on the road knows that. Your confidence can cause someone else to react out of anxiety, or panic. THAT is why you don't speed and obey the laws of the road.

The road does not belong to you and you have no reason to speed. Period. No excuses. I don't care what justifications you have. You cannot put your own priorities over someone elses safety. That makes you selfish, and a terrible driver. Driving is a responsibility some people should not have, they don't take it seriously enough.

It would appear that Musk demands quality in the same way, but we've yet to see if he'll pull it off... But there *is* a lot of room for improvement in the auto industry. Massive amounts, really. 95% of the cars out there today are, in reality, crap. 

If someone capitalizes on all the room for improvement that there is, they can corner the market, and it would appear that Musk has figured that out, and possibly has the resources to pull it off.

At this point, it's definitely a gamble. I'm not as confident as a lot of people are. My view at this point in time is that it's a company that has the potential to make a lot of people a lot of money. But, in the very least, it would probably be a safe long term stock.

I had table service upstairs and I tried, TRIED, to count for non-Asians. I counted 5 out of the hundreds of people I saw. Perhaps Motif is an Asian bar and I was at the wrong place, I don't know.

I hear about college bars, and I have no clue which bars those are because no one ever specifies them. I'm down to visit any club/bar in downtown that is even half-worth visiting if it's not just a bunch of Asians. I'm fine with a bunch of college students, Hispanic, Blacks, etc. Fuck, I just want diversity. I expect to get flailed for my opinion, but so be it.","1367366729"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;The word 'jew' itself is quite a recent invention (though that is a point of linguistics and nothing else)

No, it isn't.  It's from a French term, which is from the Latin, which is from the Aramaic/Hebrew term.  See [here](http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Jew&amp;allowed_in_frame=0).  Using it to mean all Israelite-descendants is attested in the bible.

&gt;and the modern jewish faith can be traced to Rabbeinu Gershom ben Judah[1] (960AD - 1040 or 1028AD)

Except that there's ample evidence of Jews beforehand, and the qualification of *Ashkenazi* Jews indicates that there's nothing resembling the formation of a new religion.  If you actually read what Rabbeinu Gershom did, it was essentially the explicit codification of things that had long been preferred.  His development was gaining wide acceptance for particular prohibitions, not in making any new theology.  It'd be equally preposterous to suggest that every new theologian founds a new religion.

&gt;In the bible, specifically the Old Testament, believers are not at all referred to as 'jews' what we translate as 'jew' simply means Judaean, that is someone who lived in Judaea. With absolutely no religious connection at all. Adam, Noah, Seth, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob (Israel) etc. are not ever called 'jew'. The first mention of 'jews' (judaeans) is in 2 Kings 16:6 where they are being driven out of Elath by the Edomites, a group of people who would go on to completely ethnically displace the 'native' judaeans (obviously they themselves had conquered their way there earlier in the book). The reason the word 'jew' or 'judaean' crops up at all in the Old Testament is because the ten northern tribes and the two southern tribes of Israel split under King Rehoboam, the Northern tribes formed Israel, and the southern Judah (judaea).

Except that the practice of calling all Israelite-descendants Judeans (e.g. Jews, since the terms are the same in Hebrew, Aramaic, Greek, and Latin) dates from the biblical period, and is common in ancient texts.  The destruction of the non-Judean Israelite kingdom, as well as the tribe of Judah's dominance, led to this.

&gt;'' Edom is in modern Jewry."" - The Jewish Encyclopedia, 1925 edition, Vol. 5, Page 41.

I can find no legitimate citation saying that.

&gt;The Jewish Encyclopedia: “Khazars, a non-Semitic, Asiatic, Mongolian tribal nation who emigrated into Eastern Europe about the first century, who were converted as an entire nation to Judaism in the seventh century by the expanding Russian nation which absorbed the entire Khazar population, and who account for the presence in Eastern Europe of the great numbers of Yiddish-speaking Jews in Russia, Poland, Lithuania, Galatia, Besserabia and Rumania.”

The mass-conversion of the Khazars is disputed (historians debate whether only a few elites converted, or whether the whole populace did), as is the proportion of the Eastern European Jewish community they make up.  The fact that they're Yiddish-speaking is strong evidence against that hypothesis.","1367366730"

Also, the lack of any trinity made group play in that game horrible for me. If you don't depend on other players and have reason to coordinate together in a way other than ""run away when low on hp from mobs / players and hope someone else takes over"" it isn't much of a multiplayer game.

Neverwinter is doing much better. I *hope* they don't lose the trinity mechanics they have now, where you do kind of need a cleric + guardian.

I think the more specialization of role, the better group play gets. When you give everyone everything, gameplay is cheapened and gets boring.","1367366730"

However, here in the United States you have public libraries, and many ways of getting free access to the internet, plus plenty of folks with phones.

It really depends on the particular person's circumstances, not all homeless people are equal.  Some are temporarily homeless, some have been like that for years etc... Some actually have storage units, with cars etc... Some have family, some don't, IT really just depends on the particular. Once again, this is not a problem specific to bitcoin.

Further, you might deny that you believe ""this perspective exists"", for the reasons I gave earlier (you might deny that you believe christianity is true, even if you are experiencing the thought ""christianity is true""). 

&gt;But it is not simply the case that you know what B-qualia is, you moreover are in a state that is like being in B, i.e. in your current state has B-qualia. To be in a state in which you appear to believe B is to be in a state that is like believing B. To abuse you Giraffe example, if I a in in a mental state that has perception-of-sense-datum-of-a-giraffe-qualia, then it is a perception with the sense data of a giraffe. It may not be the case that a giraffe is there, but this is external to my believing that I perceive one.

I'm not sure what you mean. My current state is *like* believing in B when I remember what it is like to believe christianity, but that doesn't entail that I actually believe christianity! All it entails is that I'm experiencing what it is like to believe christianity, not that I actually am believing it. 

This won't be enough for your argument, since I can *experience what it is like* to believe ""this perception exists"" without actually believing it (by recalling what it is like). ","1367366740"

I completely know that this is purely due to repression (from ""society"", family and mostly myself). But since I came out to my friends and started being actively gay I couldn't imagine being with a girl...again. 

Now I'm not by any means saying just come out, try it with a guy, then you'll know...that is totally wrong, there was one very very clear dealbreaker for me for which I knew for certain I'm gay: Pure love of the cock...from before puberty, the thought of it, shape of it, sexiness of it everything, It was pretty obv to me and did my best to repress that but no hope, its too beautiful of an organ!

TL:DR: Do you love the dick or are you a pussy lover? at the end of those are the main things you willl have to deal with in whichever sexuality you feel you may be. Hope this helped and wasn't too much of a ramble.

- The author of this piece writes about a study that ""as you've realized, is kind of messed up"".

- The author calls the study ""messed up"" based on assigning a premise to the study, without establishing that the study has that premise.  From my reading, this seems more like projection on the part of the author.

In other words, there does not need to be a conspiracy by women to defraud men, in order for a study to find that men spend more when in the presence of attractive women.  Nor to find that a chemical compound mitigates this higher level of spending.

- Why would that author link to this forum, while also calling it disturbing?  That provides link juice, and redership.

- I agree with that particularly interesting comment by

However, I view it as a right to complain when the candidate I vote for loses. The country is in shambles and it frightens me. A few questions:

* What steps can be taken on my part to help get you a fair shake in the media when it comes to televised debates? 

* Why are Libertarians viewed as more extreme than the other parties (I view the left and right wing parties as way more extreme and flawed)?

* How can a normal person like me help change that notion where I live (east coast in deep democratic territory)? 

* Why is federal government so thick headed about the war on drugs and the complete and utter failure of it?

Thank you for doing this.

However, in the case of Jeremy Lin, we can't call him deceptively quick if there are numerous examples of him beating players on the drive.  Even if he doesn't do it all the time, he has done it enough to where we shouldn't be surprised whenever it happens.

Maybe it is better to say that a player made a deceptively quick move rather than the player himself being called deceptively quick.

I don't know why I brought it up because I really don't get offended by what people say that could be stretched into being interpreted as racist.  I am just aware of the trigger words and lately, that has been a hot trigger word. I just saw a Simmons podcast with Jacoby and Jalen Rose where they poke fun at the terms used for white guys such as hustle, stays after practice, locker room guy where no harm was meant.

I think the overall attitude is that some things we say can be considered offensive. We know no harm was intended, but at the same time, we probably should avoid saying it now that it has become a cliche to describe certain groups of athletes. The cliche part may be more embarrassing than the unintentional stretchable racism undertone. ","1367366747"

Yeah it sounds kinda crazy, but here's the story. So I was about 14 and a bunch of my friends and I just came from a movie and we were walking to Dalton's house. Being the jerks we were, me, Sam, Noah and Alex decided to ditch them. We slipped out without them noticing, and decided to take a shortcut to Dalton's house and scare them when they get there. We were walking, and we just passed the street to run through the foresty area, (it was only about a 100 yards long). As we were walking through, we heard something that all of us could only describe as a ""demon frog"" croaks. But it wasn't just one, it sounded like there were hundreds of them. I gave a nervous laugh at first, but then it started to get louder. At that point, we were all in a sprint. Once we felt like we had run far enough, we slowed down. We started to talk and agreed that it was probably are friends trying to get back at us for ditching them. But then we saw are friends running like 50 yards or so ahead of us. That's when it hit me. My friends were running at an odd angle and they were to far ahead of us to have pulled a trick on us. We still talk about, none of us have no idea what it was, and frankly, I don't really want to know.

&gt;[Unlike most Apollo moon landing doubters, I don’t claim that nobody has ever been to the moon. All I claim is that this achievement did not happen at the time and using the methods and personnel history tells us it did. I think it’s likely, even probable, that people from the Earth have traveled to the moon and probably other planets too. There may even be permanent human settlements all over the solar system and beyond; in fact its possible that the Apollo footage was indeed filmed in an outdoor studio on the moon or a similar airless heavenly body. With the secret technology developed by experts in anti-gravity, along with that back-engineered from salvaged alien spacecraft crashes, it seems unlikely that initiated members of the human race have not used this technology to build craft with capabilities way beyond anything of those publicly-available. Humanity will never travel around the solar system in the crude, Stone Age chemical rockets we see chugging their way labouriously into low Earth orbit on TV. Hopefully one day soon all people on our planet will have access to the sophisticated science the Illuminati currently hoards for its own advantage and then we will indeed become creatures of the stars.](http://hpanwo.blogspot.com/2009/01/i-went-to-godamn-moon.html)

&gt;Obviously this is on the top of almost every guys bucket list, but to those of you who are in a committed, monogamous relationship, how do you think this would affect your love life and overall relationship if you had a MFF threesome? 

&gt;I've read stories all over reddit saying how the girlfriend felt insecure, jealous and regretted the whole thing afterwards. I don't think of myself as the jealous type, but my thinking is, there probably wasn't a lot of trust before the couple decided to have the threesome. My SO and I have discussed this idea for quite some time now, and I'm super open minded and would love to fulfill this fantasy for him. However, his fantasy involves me and the other girl messing with each other while he watches, and he would have sex with me only, while the other girl and I still play. 

&gt;This sounds awesome, right? But these types of girls who are down for this type of thing with a couple is called a unicorn for a reason. I've considered hiring an escort and things along the lines of that, but there's plenty of time to discuss this with him. I've posted in /r/sex, /r/relationships and /r/relationship_advice and only getting replies along the lines of ""jealousy always finds a way to surface"", ""you're inexperienced, so what's in it for her?"" and ""you'll never find someone willing."" 

&gt;Yes, I have absolutely zero experience with women in a sexual manner, and no I'm not sexually attracted to the same sex, but that doesn't mean I won't try to show her a good time. If it turns my SO on by watching me do these things to another woman, then I'll be turned on and it will make me want to get more brave and dirty with the girl. Is this something that's going to be impossible to achieve? 

&gt;And to address the jealousy and insecurity factor, we are both very much in love and I'm fairly confident in our relationship. He isn't interested in having sex with another woman and I don't consider it cheating if he wants to see another girl naked and playing with me. The way I see it is that he'll be even more attracted to me for wanting to do these sort of things for him. This wouldn't be strictly for him, either.

I don't switch careers, however, for the same reason I'm not a DBA; code when deployed to scale must be computationally efficient such that it performs reasonably in line with the hardware it's given. I've met too damn many devs who create sloppy, inefficient code and complain the hardware is bad when it doesn't run well under load.  Sure, syntax and all that is great but once you've learned it in one language, learning it in another is just window dressing. 

Applied theory is so much more important than individual knowledge of a language's syntax. And applying it well is *hard*. Too bad so few do. ","1367366762"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","You may know the ins and outs of every Fender model ever made. I don't. I'm not ashamed of it and I don't see how that disqualifies me from purchasing one.

Do you know the bolt pattern of your transmission pan? What number should the VIN start with? Have you memorized the spark plug gap your vehicle manufacturer specifies? How about the stitching in the seats. What pattern should the seams have? If not, maybe you shouldn't be driving. Get my point?

I've been playing on and off for about 15 years. I know how to setup guitars to my liking. When you own a bunch there's pretty much always something to do. What I don't do is peruse the internet memorizing what every Fender model's specifications should be. Between variations in headstock shape, string trees, fretboard wood, bridge style, etc, there's dozens of combinations of just strats. 

If I was buying this off of craigslist I'd have been much more apt to do diligent research. I was at a fucking authorized Fender dealer. The reason I bought this one? It was more comfortable than the others I tried. Even though it wasn't my first choice in color, it had a better feel. They all sounded the same to me. 

What I did learn is that Fender is overpriced. If the knockoff won me over in a store full of $1000 strats, why the hell would I ever consider buying one again? I won't. This guitar fills my strat niche. I pretty much just wanted one to play Jimi and SRV shit. This'll do the job just fine. If I'm on the market for a Fender-esque guitar again I'll be peeping G&amp;Ls or, shit, knockoffs. 

Oh and you did kind of sound like a dick, but it's hard to be critical on the internet without doing so because of the absence of body language, inflection, hand gestures, and whatnot. So, no harm no foul as far as I'm concerned.

For the record, I'm not calling Fender. I've smoothed things over with the folks at the store. And the trem arm was one I had laying around. The guitar didn't come with it. The only thing I've noticed about this guitar that is of shit quality is the tuners. They suck. Once those get replaced I'll know more about the bridge quality. And the nut I'm sure is cheap ass plastic so that'll get swapped as well. ","1367366768"

"gamingsuggestions","t5_2sxyv","It depends on what you're looking for, I would think. 

The newest Mortal Kombat is a pretty damned fun game, and has a REALLY REALLY robust single-player mode. You don't get to spend a ton of time with each character, but you could always use that to learn the basics, and the plot, while terrible, is presented well and very entertaining. It is a bit slower, though, than most of the Japanese fighters I've played, like Street Fighter.

If you're looking for something more fast-paced/less violent and gory, Street Fighter IV is fantastic. I've found that Capcom fighters are pretty easy to learn; you can pick up basic combos really fast. I've not played it myself, but I've heard Street Fighter x Tekken is really good about this, and it supposedly has a VERY robust tutorial mode to boot.

The Soul Calibur and Tekken games are also great; these are the fighting games I played a lot when I was younger. I LOVED playing a few rounds of Tekken Tag or booting up Soul Calibur II with some friends.

Persona 4 Arena I've found to be pretty accessible. It has a rather in-depth story mode, and is great, especially if you like Persona. Arc System Works' other games, Guilty Gear and BlazBlue, are also great and a hell of a lot of fun to play even if you're a beginner, but they are ABSURDLY complex and complicated, so it's hard to play them beyond your basic button mashing.

In terms of sheer fun, I absolutely love JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Combos are all pretty simple and easy to pull off, and it doesn't have the complexity of a lot of other later fighters. The Stand system is unique and interesting, and the game is actually just batshit crazy all the time. INCREDIBLY fun to play.

I'm also quite fond of the Marvel vs. Capcom series. MvC2 has a whopping 56 characters, half Capcom and half Marvel. It can be intimidating for the sheer number of characters, but it's a hell of a lot of fun and most of the combos aren't too difficult. MvC3 is also fantastic, but it's VERY VERY VERY fast-paced.

In terms of tips, blocking is very important (something I didn't realize when I was a kid). Jumping straight into online play is probably a bad idea, practice on Single Player first. Also, it's a hell of a lot of fun to play fighting games with friends; invite some friends over and get some sort of tournament up and running. 

Sorry, I know this was a really really long post. I think when it comes down to it, I'd go with either MK9, a Street Fighter title, or Marvel vs. Capcom 2. They're all fairly forgiving to newcomers. I enjoy the fast pace of Japanese fighters, but Mortal Kombat also has the incredibly robust story mode.

If it tested and the results show that we are infact a simulated universe, would that not then indicate a created universe? Not picking nits here, but we would then have some sort of validation that our universe is not a random series of events, but a series of coordinated simulations, possibly being recorded, thus indicating a higher intelligence than our own? That intelligence being responsible for every single particle in our universe, every law of nature and ultimately every argument about it's existence.

I'm not saying that the creator(s) are to be hailed as gods, but looked at as fellow scientists. 

While I'm on the subject of creation. When we start creating synthetic life, successful synthetic life (self replicating, long life), would we not be considered creators, specifically if the life becomes self-aware?

Something like a segregated prom would *never* happen in the vast majority of cities in the South either, so don't act like that level of racism is common, because it's not.

To speak to your other point. Yes, I know that the reason why people group together is based on culture, but the fact is that you can't separate race from that. It just doesn't happen. The phenomenon happens with good intentions, but leads to bad results.

I am not claiming that races in major cities *never* mix, but I am claiming that they mix less and more hostility and open racism occurs from those dividing borders than in the moderately sized cities of the south, except for Atlanta. Sure, at a university you will see people of all races. How about you take a drive into East LA and tell me that white people mix with the mexicans or take a drive into Compton or even the wealthy black area of Baldwin Hills.

If I may be entirely honest, I am certain that the upcoming DLC for Infinite was a concession on Irrational's part to please 2K, who wanted some extra bits to push (something they didn't get from the original Bioshock, but 2K Marin provided them along with Multiplayer and the like in Bioshock 2).","1367366777"

A 747 (like this one) can carry more than 48000 Gallons (200000L) of fuel.  It is carried in the wings and a central fuel tank.  When a plane crashes, a huge amount of fuel is vented, thus causing a large explosion.

I don't give a shit about Colbert's free Apple products. If anything, I don't see it too far out of bounds that he is remembering his love of Apple on air, in tribute to the man who was responsible for them. 

But hey, I'm not him. We don't know. I watch Colbert for his humor, which is usually taken with a grain of salt, so I knew how to take his Apple promotion- but the way they transitioned into the very real ""Right back at ya"" (implying thanks for all he's done and accomplished on our world) along with the silence was touching.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","More conducive to irrigation and political homogeniety for greater periods of human history.

China and India are more populous due to geography. Lots of deltas and flat land, great for rice cultivation. Not quite as much disease as Africa. Also, buffalo- oxen are a rapid boost to cultivation. Africa lacked domesticable oxen in the plains regions (if Zebra were trainable then Zimbabwe would be a world power today).

So it's nothing characteristic in the genetics of the population per se. It's just that China and India had the best land for long term cultivation that was reachable soonest. The lack of mountains also were conducive towards the creation of dynastic empires- few mountain passes or other defensible terrain. That's why the Mughals and the British were both able to conquer India.

Wasn't one of those bias members actually the head of the FDA who mysteriously resigned after the letter was submitted?

I love how there is so much literature out there by qualified labs, but the only one the public is aware of is the FDA, because 'the FDA must be the only one'.

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","In 2000, my father became obsessed with online resources about the church. He spent hours and hours reading, printing, filing and researching church history. He filled a room with binders...wall-to-wall. We never saw him. He was always in that room and on the computer. It was only last year when I started to do the same (on a much smaller scale) that I realized what he was doing and what he was going through. The difference between him and I, is I didn't buy the apologists arguments. I got so angry with him. He knew all of these things and still bought into it! Why didn't he tell me?! How could he be so blind?! 


But then I realized that if my dad had come to the same conclusion that I had, it would've completely screwed him up. He's had a hard life. He's made stupid decisions because of his faith; decisions that ultimately ruined his career and personal life. By the world's standards, he's a failure. In the church, he is somebody. If he cannot believe there is a reward waiting for him on the other side, then he's made a real mess of his life for nothing. He is so unhappy. He doesn't have the skill set to cope with the church not being true. It is better for him to believe.

Don isn't jewish, but I think coming up in advertising in the 50s would have had some similar challenges for a farm boy.

Yeah, I hear you, and I'm sure most people solo most of the time.  But it still surprises me sometimes, I inspect when I can, and often see hard core raiders with super max agility, all dps traits and relics on their weapons, all dps special rings and bracelets and necklaces, etc., and what must be diddly squat for vitality/morale/resistance, or fate/icpr, and no extra incoming heals, and no extra threat reduction.  Glass cannons is my suspicion.

I know the high agility helps, you don't get hurt by what you evade and parry.  But I must be within 5% of those folks on my stats and DPS, and yet be substantially more survivable.  Maybe their kins are full of perfect ultimate tanks so they can't steal agro, and ungodly healers that can always pay attention to everyone.  Maybe that last 5% of dps is the gold plating that lets them brag, and gets them invites as some kind of ultimate hunters.  Maybe they are.  But that last 5% has ***never once*** cost me or anyone else a defeat from what I can tell, and it doesn't even slow me down in solo.  And for that 5% sacrifice on DPS I am remarkably unsquishy for a hunter, and the people I play with appreciate that a lot.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","I'd make the central government a night-watchman state, but then allow political parties to have some government-like powers.  So if you want social welfare program, that's fine, join the social democrat party.  That party would then have the power to tax you and provide services in accordance to it's policies.

Of course, there would be limits on the powers of parties to prevent abuses (i.e. the Republicans can't sentence you to death for getting an abortion, they'd have only limited and appropriate powers such a revoking your membership or denying you the benefits that they grant).  Parties would be allowed to structure themselves however they see fit.  Your party wants direct democracy with no central leadership.  Fine.  Monarchy?  Ok, if that's your thing.  Socialism or communism? Sure, why not.  Party membership would be 'at will', the party can eject (or refuse to admit) a member if they so choose, and a member can leave any time they choose.  If you elect to join, then you must agree to abide by their terms and conditions, and they will have to power to enforce their laws and levy taxes (within limits) so long as you remained a member.  No party would have the authority to enforce it's laws on non-members.

Geographic entities such as cities, provinces, regions, and the country as a whole would have a central government and justice system that would protect everyone regardless of party affiliation and act as mediator in disputes between parties and individuals or between two parties, as well as handle those matters such as national defense and environmental regulation that by necessity are collective actions on the part of everyone.  The central government would however be strictly limited to keep it as small and efficient as possible, while keeping the impact on daily life to a minimum.  The bar for laws in the central government would be set high, so only those laws which could generate a strong consensus across the board would become universal.  More controversial laws would be left to the parties and would only apply to those who opted into said parties.

These central, 'shared' governments would be governed by a council of representatives, with the power of each party proportionate to the membership of the constituency.

For example, something like social security would not be made universal, instead it would be handed off to the Democratic Party.  They would have the power to levy taxes to pay for it, and would be in charge of paying out the benefits.  However, they would only have the power to apply the policy to their own members.  The Republican Party could pass a law banning abortion, but it would only be binding on Republicans.  Marxists could set up a communist party that adhered to their principals, so long as they don't try and enforce their rules on others.

For those that read neal Stephenson's *Diamond Age*, it's similar to the concept of 'Phyles' but with a weak, libertarian-style central authority to allow for mutual cooperation between them and a common system of justice and contract enforcement.

tl;dr - have a minimalist libertarian-style central government, leave most issues beyond that to non-geographical political entities that would function as opt-in 'meta-governments'.","1367366803"
"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Usually, you could say work schedules or school life maybe bring on a lot of stress. Family life, too. Even poor diets lower libido.

It could also be that you've fallen into sexual routines that are no longer exciting. Or maybe that you are looking for something  in your sex life - you are both quite young, and were each others. That might leave you wondering what things would be like with other partners.

But until you know yourself what might be at the root of your disinterest, I don't think you can really get good advice.

I suggest browsing /r/relationships and /r/sex. You will find a lot of posts from people having similar experiences. Maybe that can help you figure out what questions to ask.

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","There is a similar thing with the Malconvoker. (considering Mal is Latin for Bad and it's a Conjurationist's dream class and a wizard might be called an evoker the name translates to Evil Summoner Wizard in my mind.)  
It's a class that specialises in Summoning and Binding Demons...in order to do good... to ""fight fire with fire"" or... ""fight firebreathing demons with firebreathing demons"" and a whole Know Thy Enemy vibe. It's restrictions are actually Good or Neutral Alignment.  
Onto Necromancy... Now some spells have a [Good] and [Evil] descriptor and casting those spells is committing a [Good] or [Evil] act. Some DM's will say like 5 acts shifts your alignments, some DM's will say 50 [Evil] acts makes you evil... it depends. Most DM's would say Rape was way different to killing an enemy combatent after he yielded... the first might count as all five or fifty steps, yet the other might be 1/5 or 2/50 or something. It's very DM Fiat.  
You can play your character as noble and good and do nothing but good... but it depends on your DM awarding you good and evil points really... otherwise you can write whatever you want on your sheet.  
Maybe you could research some spells with the [Good] Descriptor... mostly healing magic I'd imagine and in your spare time when you're not adventuring wander around and heal the sick and volunteer at a temple that heals or blesses people.  
So... either accept it's an evil act and do lots of good to ""balance the scales"" or Talk to your DM about ""using fire to fight fire"". Overall if your character is good and pious he should over come any sort of corruption to his moral fiber that casting [Evil] spells might try to taint him with.","1367366803"

The game was critically acclaimed but it aimed for a group of gamers that were somewhat computer literate, which is all you needed to download games for the console.

They include idealism over convenience, gas is still better than electric, you will have to wait for a pickup which sucks, and like taxies they will congregate around busy areas so if you are outside of priority areas you wait longer. Peak demand will easily outstrip peak supply thanks to morning/evening rush hour. People like to drive for vacations a lot of times, and so a car will need to transit up to 500+ miles away which take about 7-9 hours. People with children will constantly be dealing with car seats/bases/boosters every trip and will need to carry or store them somewhere once they are at their destination. If it is simple point A to B, what happens if you change your mind, and now go to point C? Um, what about the elderly who need extra items, oxygen tank/wheelchair, and special needs in getting in or out. 


So, a lot of considerations that don't really work out in the long run. Sounds like a single redditor with no children in their early 20s at most who thinks idealism wins over simplicity and convenience. Also, one glaring missing aspect is the person seems to have forgotten about suburbs, and thinks *""most people live in cities""* means the **city** and not the city and its suburbs. ","1367366807"

Sure, developers deserve to be compensated for their hard work. And if the developer is handing the game to me (this is a hypothetical ""me""), I'll pay their price for it. But if someone else offers me the exact same data for no charge, it's not stealing in any way to accept it from them; likewise it's not stealing to make copies of that data and distribute those copies as you please. Doing so may indirectly divert customers away from the developer, but that's an entirely different issue from ""stealing"", in more ways than just semantics. It is an important issue, but it deserves to be treated separately from some righteous moral stand against ""piracy"".

I feel the need to reiterate - but I wish I didn't have to - that I, personally, only play games I buy. When I was younger, had less money, and most importantly, was less mature, I pirated games (I have since bought every game I can remember playing), but now that I have an income I am willing and *able* to actually spend money.

I've personally known a lot of people who ended up with addictions, and talked to most of them at length about the topic.  One of them got clean after a gram a day habit of morphine.

Buprenorphine has one of the longest elimination times of any opiate currently used.  There was one 'back in the day' that had a longer half life, but I don't remember what it was.  It also has an anti-depressant effect.  Once it hits your receptors, it stays for a while, so any other opiates won't really get the chance to trigger very many of them.  This basically means that it not only is a shitty high, but fucks up your chances of getting high in the next like two days.

This guy that was pretty small ran in with a mask on and pointed a gun in our faces and asked for our wallets and phones. I was a junior in high school at the time and am a pretty big guy (I played offensive line). My first thought was to go for the gun because I knew I could take him. Luckily I held back and didn't because little did I know there was another guy with a shotgun holding up the rest of my family in the garage.  

Now whether their guns were loaded or not is a different matter, but that is not something you chance when your family's lives are at stake (as well as your own). 

Anyway they took my wallet, my phone was in my car, and the police never caught them.","1367366814"

Of course it could take a long time, but the last internal password this company used was &lt; 8 characters and the name of the suburb their headquarters was based in. Of course they could have stepped up their security policies and now be using a high security 20+ character password, but I'm not sure they are.

3. Foreign Trial - Only if we can guarantee they won't be tortured once they get there.

4. Free them - Of the current 166 prisoners still there, 86 are eligible to be sent home as free men. The catch is their respective countries don't want them back.

She told me it would be like a truth serum, and so I got some stuff off my chest to my fellow tripper that I was planning to tell him later, privately, not that day. Nothing friendship killing, but something that didn't need to be said right then. 


Same girl kept responding to everything we said like it was the dumbest stuff ever, even something as rational (though I admit a bit confusing) as ""the person you're talking to on the phone right now is driving on that overpass right there. That's why you keep yelling that he's nearby but can't find him. The overpass goes over the trail; he can't get here unless he parks near our house and walks to meet us. Do you want to walk back to meet him by the parking lot?""


""Uhhh... wait, so... you're saying he's above our heads? You're such a shroom kid.""


""NO REALLY. That overpass RIGHT THERE that he keeps shouting over the phone that he's on!""


*to phone* ""Ok, so... I guess we're walking back along the trail for some reason, shroom kids, can't explain them.""


""Gimme the phone. Hey, man, here's how you get to the trailhead. You're right above us. You see us? Cool. I don't think I see you, because I'm tripping balls and the sky looks like a marble dome full of sparkles and blinding light. But I know where you are and how you can get to us. Trust me.""


""...Shroom kids be crazy, I don't know what you're talking about. Guys in the sky, psh.""



And she hid our phones from us. Which turned out to be really annoying because she left and wouldn't tell us where, would only say ""You'll find them when you're ready.""


I really didn't want her as a minder anyway, but she insisted on being there for the first time I did mushrooms. Seriously, if you don't really like someone, don't let them bully you, it'll be a much better time if you don't.


On the plus side, I actually had a really good time on shrooms and LSD (they are about the same for me, different visuals but similar experiences, if that makes sense) and have a few times since then. Even a bad ""minder"" can be ok as long as you're just in it for a good time. And it really can be transcendent. LSD and shrooms helped me get out of a depressive spiral and into a goal-oriented mindset that has started turning my life around from a sober, depressed nihilist to a happy, hardworking woman who is starting to believe that life can be both fun and meaningful, and that the universe is... well, it might be uncaring, but in a majestic way, not a cold, terrible way.

You can see a notable inflection point at week 7. Weeks 1-6 he averaged 83.2 yards per game. Weeks 7-17 he averaged 159.8 yards per game, almost twice as much. Considering the severity of the injury he was coming off of this season, it's perfectly conceivable that had he been healthy, he at least *might* have been able to play the entire season at that higher average, which would have put him at 2556.8 yards.

"boardgames","t5_2qmjp","It's also defined in our wiki: http://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/acronyms

&gt;These aren't abbreviations or acronyms, but they come up often enough that they're worthwhile to include here. Generally, boardgames here tend to be divided into one of these two categories:

&gt;    Euro-games (Sometimes called German-style games): These tend to be very strategic games where luck plays a very small role. The theme of the game is generally not too important, and in some cases can be ignored by players completely (causing some to refer to themes as ""tacked on""). As found in BGG's definition, ""The players' decision-making skills have a high significance in determining the outcome.""

&gt;    Thematic games (Sometimes called Ameritrash, or Experience games): These put heavy emphasis on the theme of the game, many times will include intricate miniatures, and often (though not always) have a significant element of luck (for example, via dice rolling). The overall play experience is very much driven by the theme.

When in a steadying climbing turn, the outside wing has a higher AoA than the inside wing and will stall first. When the right wing stalled, notice how the airplane significantly yawed to the right.

However, if someone comes up behind you and grabs your arse, and you fear they may do worse, then yes, you can hit back in self defense.  If it's someone you've already warned not to touch you at least once (some states require you to say it twice), and he still does it, then you are fully within your rights to slap him, and yes, it will be sexual harassment.

I will be the first to admit that I have on at least one occasion threatened a man at a bar who started touching me in a manner that I was uncomfortable with (he kept grabbing my shoulder and trying to hold my hand when I was at another table and obviously out with someone else).  I warned him in no uncertain terms that if he wished to keep his hand that he had better remove it, because the next time he touched me I was not going to hold back.  He did not touch me again.

You could also ask to speak to the manager of the bar and ask to have the man removed.  At the very least if may be able to be charged as disorderly conduct.  :/","1367366839"

That is going to make you literally 0 friends. If we were having a conversation and I felt that you were holding things back because I might somehow not be able to deal with how awesome you are, then I would just walk away.

It's not that hard (or at least it shouldn't be) to talk about these things without coming across as arrogant. For example, when you talk about your work you can describe what exactly you do day to day, what you enjoy about the job, and how you have been able to take advantage of certain opportunities. That will sound a lot better than 'I own a company and am founding another because I am a genius, also I am rich and it lets me travel all the time'.

"KerbalSpaceProgram","t5_2smr1","KSP had to do some fudging with gravity, atmosphere and size scales. the problem is that the physics engine is not capable of such a wide variety of speeds, like 10 m/s for a rover or 10,000 m/s for a rocket so they changed some stuff to make it all work. Now if you notice acceleration on Kerbin is about 10 m/s about what Earth's gravity, but orbital speed on Earth is about 7 km/s instead of Kerbin's 2.2 km/s the reason for this difference is because (I think) Kerbin is a lot smaller than Earth and so it takes less speed to ""miss"" the planet. As far as atmosphere Kerbin's ends at around 70km while space on Earth technically starts at around 100 km, but there is a lot of aerodynamic drag at this altitude and most LEO satellites orbit over 200 km, but on this basically scaled down version of Earth I guess a smaller atmosphere is believably, but the rockets are scaled down to I believe ( you might not care about this and really want to try to get a KSP scale rocket to get into Earth orbit, I know I have). It all works very well together though in a very believable representation of our own solar system while working around some major computing challenges. I think if they went with doing a simulation to scale I think it could only handle the Earth and the moon due to the crazy differences in velocity.

TLDR- I think KSP is a pretty good at mimicking real life, with some important differences put there to make it more computer freindly.","1367366840"

My point was that if you aren't going to provide criticism then you should just accept the changes, or at the very least wait until the changes have been made and then make your remarks since you will at least have first-hand testing experience. 

I'm all for being cynical towards a developer due to their history, but until you provide some hard evidence or possible solutions then your remarks provide nothing to the discussion. 

If you're this passionate about the game, perhaps you should create a sort of short essay (posted either on this subreddit, the official forums, or both) that demonstrates what Hi-Rez should be working on, what they should drop working on, etc. and provide solutions/examples for each of your points.

It was a light switch we'd never turn on if walking through (leaving the hall dark), and generally the only time we'd turn it on was the middle of the night. So essentially, the light is a spot that's usually dark, but not dark enough to always require light. Because it's on a dimmer, we have it set on a low setting so in the middle of the night it isn't jarring.

It's also true that our understanding of time is dubious at best and that the writers choose not to explore paradoxes (a mistake IMO, since it's one of the most interesting part of the multiverse theory).

Sadly, I think that by hammering some information such has the is, was, will thingy, or the constant/variable dichotomy while putting forth an ending that denies (to a certain extent) what can be inferred from playing the game, the writers shot themselves in the foot.

Honestly, the game was verrrry good, it belongs amongst my personal top 5. But the ending (which was excellent until the killing Comstock in the crib concept) kinda cheapen the whole thing (I know, I'm picky as fuck).

I would have had no problem if the fact of killing Comstock at that very moment only put forth the creation of a third timeline (no paradox), since that's how people usually resolve the grand-father problem. In fact, I think that it would had been better to represent the theme of fatality, since in the end, nothing Booker and Elizabeth did would had mattered.

Because in the end, while time is a concept that we can only try to understand, it's the Luteces whom enforce the idea that time is a continuum of past, present and future, thus creating the perceived paradox that I described in my previous post.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","&gt; Why? You think one case changes the entire validity of the yearly CDC report on abortion? You're giving Gosnell WAY too much credit.

It's not the case de per se. It's stuff like this:

*Then the inspectors stopped coming at all: “With the change of administration from Governor [Bob] Casey to Governor [Tom] Ridge,” wrote the grand jury, “officials concluded that inspections would be ‘putting a barrier up to women’ seeking abortions. Better to leave clinics to do as they pleased, even though, as Gosnell proved, that meant both women and babies would pay.*

&gt; Yes.

Then for how long after the baby is born shall the discretionary power of the mother be extended? What exactly separates a ""post-birth abortion"" from an infanticide? Anything else than semantics? What's in name by which we call a rose....

Do you think Gosnell should be declared innocent? It seems your answer should be affirmative, if you're consequential. 

&gt; Again, I saw we approach it from the other side, by loosening restrictions and lowering the costs of late term abortions, so people won't have to go outside the law.

But who went outside the law? Gosnell's clinic was absolutely legal. I don't think anyone disputes that. The problem was that the law wasn't enforced. Is that what you mean by ""outside the law? But you claim that the law shouldn't be enforced. 

&gt; It's common knowledge for anyone who studies abortion all around the world.

Well, as I suspected my hopes would be crushed:*(hopefully not that study from PP's research branch that doesn't adjust for the level of development of each country)*. You're aware the the Guttmacher Institute is the scientific research arm of Planned Parenthood and openly a pro-abortion institution, right? That isn't a study, it's crude propaganda. I already hinted why in my previous comment but I can explain it further if you want.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Follow up Emily- I've seen it argued compellingly that the equivalent term for males is ""coward."" Both slut and coward imply a lack of honor, trustworthiness and fitness for marriage. A man does not typically want to wed a slut, and a woman does not want to wed a coward.

Underneath this is the assertion that different standards do exist for men and women, based on their different goals in a relationship (on the aggregate, of course- individual variations of course exist). 

A man with multiple partners is not called a slut, so the argument goes, for the same reason that a woman on a sinking ship that accepted a seat on the lifeboat ahead of others is not called a coward. 

Unfair perhaps, but reflective of widely held sentiments.

"aves","t5_2rev7","Call your credit card company and make sure they know you're going to make a purchase! Almost got me the first time around.

My advice- 

* Know what you want beforehand- prices, amount (I believe it's max 4 per person)


* Have your info/credit card present and ready. It'll make it much faster and easier. 


* Have a first, second and third pick of the ticket types you want and know the prices of each. That way, if your 1st pick is sold out by the time you get to the front, you don't even have to pause to think, just grab the next pick asap.

* Go to sleep early night before. Wake up an hour or so beforehand so you're fully awake and thinking clearly by the time sales roll around.

They will then take that money and run a reality TV show consisting of training the participants.  Eventually, money will start coming in from ads.  After a few seasons, the show ends and everyone walks away and the ""astronauts"" are returned to their lives saying the plan failed.  Meanwhile, the people associated with the project have been paying themselves 6 figure salaries the entire time and are millionaires by the time it ends.  The money has been successfully laundered as their salary and they walk away clean.  
I will be very surprised if they give more than a few thousand dollars in contract money to SpaceX or any legitimate space research group along the way.  Just enough to satisfy the more moderate naysayers to make it look like they aren't a scam.  SpaceX plays ball as it is free advertisement.  Their name will be plastered all over the reality show of the people in training and everyone will get the impression that SpaceX is the biggest, baddest, and only (in their minds) space exploration company in existence.

"childfree","t5_2qtwb","&gt; I'm not sure where the ""pride"" part comes in...Why do you think that
&gt; not having children is harder than having them? Each decision is life-
&gt; altering, and neither choice should be made without consideration.

Having children is the easy way out for finding a purpose in life.  Instead of working and searching to find a purpose for yourself, you have your purpose waking you up at 6:00 AM every day and taking up the vast majority of your time.  That doesn't mean you can't find a purpose without children, but it's a lot easier to just get pregnant.  

Do you think your average Wal Mart shopper with a cart full of screaming brats is capable of looking deep into their soul to figure out who they want to be?  Maybe they are, but they chose children instead of the education and self-reflection that finding their purpose requires.  Their life is over, but so is their search.  It's a fair trade to those who find the search to be beyond their ability to comprehend.

Life as a parent is harder day-to-day, but you get the respect and support of your community (provided you aren't abusive, although you can be abusive if you live in a culture where that kind of parenting is condoned).  You aren't seen as an noncontributing leech like us CFers are.  (Anyone who calls me that to my face can take a look at my property tax bill and see how much goes to local schools - most of it.)  

To parents, we haven't sacrificed what they have, so in their minds we have no room to complain about anything and are by default immature and selfish.  What separates me from most of the CF folks I meet is that I respect that viewpoint.  I know it's hard to be a parent.  I know it requires sacrifice, dedication, hard work, and tough decisions.  I know I haven't had to make those decisions or do those things.  They have, in my mind, a valid point.

My cats aren't going to wipe my ass on my deathbed. My ex-wife was estranged from her father for most of her childhood.  He was a real piece of work - he skipped town and there was a suspicious fire that gutted the family house, and he left her mom with a mortgage and over $10k in other debts.  They were homeless for a while.  She reconnected with her dad when she was 17.  He was diagnosed with cancer when she was 19 and he died right before she turned 23.  Who was there taking care of him?  Her.  Not any other member of his family.  I think about that a lot.

Maybe my nephew will be there for me when I'm old.  But he's 14 and currently wants to either be a drummer in a band or join the Marines, so who knows.

I work with a really devoted family man, the good kind.  I told him the line about my cats not being there to wipe my ass when I'm dying and he pointed out that he has no guarantee that his kids will be there either.  

It's such a complicated issue, that can't be reduced down to ""breeders"" vs ""childfree.""

&gt; So, is it difficult to remain childless? Do you really want to have
&gt; children, but have rationalized all the reasons you shouldn't? And
&gt; does not fathering biological children of your own mean that you
&gt; wouldn't love and care for the children of an SO?

I have loved and cared for children of SOs before. It killed me to leave them when the relationships ended with their mothers.  I think about some of them every day.  But ultimately they were the SOs' responsibility and not mine, and if I couldn't get along with their moms, it wasn't my place to stay there for them.  And it really wasn't their mothers' place to put me in a position to have to make promises to their kids, but that's a different issue.

&gt; It sounds almost like you really do want to be a parent to some children
&gt; but are afraid you will bring your natal family's 'bad mojo' into the new
&gt; relationship.

Very much so, but this is highly complicated too.  My family does not admit to mistakes.  They know they have made them but won't admit it because that would reduce their authority and image.  I've told them in so many words that I'm not having kids because of their baggage.  They were dismissive and seemed to infer that I was imagining things.  Gaslighting sacks of shit that they are.

I like to think I'd be a good dad, but given the nature of my family, that would require me to become even more distant from them than I already am.  My family could not be allowed to influence them or poison their minds in the way they would attempt to.

Anyway, enough of that.","1367366852"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","How ignorant one must be to take something out of context and blatantly disregard the entire point I was making. 

It is not intelligent to defer an entire industry over to an industry whose end product is completely unrelated. It would be a logistical nightmare and fail. People on both ends would be out of work. We would have an economic breakdown in that sector of industry. It is much more intelligent, rather wise, to build up a separate solar panel industry. 

The potential to create a surplus of jobs and economic growth by migrating an industry isn't as rewarding as starting a new one. The net economic growth is minimal at best. If it were economically sound it would have happened. 

But the way it is now, we have a tank industry and a solar panel industry. For the exact reasons I have mentioned. If the tank industry decides it's time to fade away, let it be because we just don't need tanks in that era. Running around thinking you can just funnel resources as simply as you say in attempt to go green is ludicrous.

So yes... it would be crazy to attempt that. ","1367366852"

I was doing ""Keto"" for about two weeks, not worrying about calories, just primarily weaning myself off sugar and caffeine.   So it's not likely to be water weight...

4/21 I started Low-cal Keto (~900 cal/day), so I'm not certain if that drop was just my system cleaning itself out, or I'm dropping at an absurd rate.

Math says I should be dropping roughly 0.7lbs a day, so it's not shabby regardless.

I'm also doing what amounts to a [23/1 IF](http://www.reddit.com/r/keto/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_fasting_and_how_does_it_benefit_me.3F) as well.    I eat right when I wake up, and just drink water the remainder of the day. (~2.5L total)

If you can avoid cheating, and don't go apeshit with the calories, it works.

Here's a visual for you.    Think of a half gallon of milk...  got the size in mind?    I've  dropped roughly THREE of them in volume already (aka 5.5L).    I don't feel different, to me I don't think I look different (3% less weight though), but the measuring tape shows progress and my clothes fit a bit different as well.

That flair measurement was two days ago... lesse..  Scale right now says 323... wearing clothes, having drank roughly 2.75L of water today, and my grub this morning.   ""official"" updates are Sunday mornings.

Layer sleeves over tshirts, don't be afraid to put a hat^on^top, and wear gloves for your hands.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","""They"" referring to ""Indian populations"". 

As for ""Does the minority of a minority not matter"", that entirely depends on the situation. How many people in the minority (of a minority) care? If it's just one, then no it doesn't. If it's 49% of American Indians, then yes it does matter. So it depends on how large that minority (of a minority) is. And then you have to consider the consequences to the issue. What is the total cost of changing the name? Is that greater or lesser than the cost to American Indians if said name were considered racist and allowed to continue to exist?

And here's where I'll plug my ""differing opinion"": American Indians lost a war for the land that became the USA. It is the only instance that I know of where the victor of the war continues to pay for, provide for, and bend to the whims of the loser. Should we be racist towards them? No, that's rude. But I'm kind of fed up with how Americans are treating them like they're the unluckiest people ever and we need to make up for it. Anyone who lived during the 19th century would laugh in our faces.","1367366861"

`I can honestly see how people could be upset about this. But I live in Allston, a five minute drive from Watertown and i was there the day of the ""self imposed martial law"". I had never felt safer and was happy to abide by the police's request. There was a terrorist on the loose. He may have only been 19 and just a kid but we knew nothing of his capabilities. My roommates left in the middle of the day to go get dunkin donuts. No one ordered them back inside, no one pointed a gun at them. They came back with coffee and muffins, bragging about the lack of traffic. Yes the military presence was a little intimidating, and one can argue that it could have been unnecessary, but the Boston police operated with extreme vigor and perseverance and were able to apprehend the kid within the day. So for those saying it was ridiculous and stupid, maybe you should consider that you didn't live it. `

"musictheory","t5_2qrjj","Hey man. Try visiting this simple ear training website. http://www.good-ear.com/

There are a variety of categories you can repeatedly test yourself with (listen, then select from a multiple choice answer), ranging from very simple, such as identifying major and minor chords, all the way to discerning complex dense jazz chords and exotic scales. 

Have your piano to hand. If you get a question wrong, try to re-create the scale/chord that you are hearing, and decode by looking at the constituent intervals/formula which chord/scale you are playing. You can re-guess each question as many times as you like before the correct answer is revealed to you.

Make a note if there are particular chords/scales that seem to keep foxing you, and play around with them more, see if you can't think of an instance of them occurring in a song/piece of music, you know well for a reference point.

Soon you will be able to do this without needing to reference to your instrument. Then move on to a harder group of chords/scales.

I personally don't subscribe to the sight-singing approach, opting instead to learn types of things separate from the stave entirely. 

When it comes to learning the aural qualities of various musical units such as chords and scales etc, I'm not sure the stave has such an integral role. 

I am no singer, but would be able to sing any mode of the major scale,  and many less common scales etc instantly. Or the arpeggio of many commonly occurring chord types. None of my particular ""aural perception/awareness"" if you will, came from stave-based work. My theoretical knowledge on the other hand, certainly did.

Feel free to PM me for any further info on how to use that website, or tips about ear training more broadly. Best of luck with it.","1367366862"

It was her personal computer in her possession at the time, thats exactly what the UW police said. No one ""hacked"" her facebook to say something like this from her account. No one is going to waste their time ""hacking"" her. She just needs to stop being a drama queen and own up to her mistakes and GTFO and move far far away.

I also should add a ""hack"" on facebook is normally someone leaving an account open on a public computer or someone getting her password, there is no ""hacking"" going on, more exploiting. Either way the UW police said it was from her personal computer that she had in her possession so her trying to claim a ""hack"" isnt going to work.

Regularly having more than 250mg a day can lead to increased anxiety, shakiness, insomnia,  and heart palpitations. One pill a day should be perfectly safe. But taking more than that can lead to typical problems associated with caffeine dependency.

She adores Catan Junior, and it's great seeing her mind develop. She's starting to get to the point where she'll make plans about how she's going to get what she needs to build the next piece she wants. It also hews pretty closely to Catan, and isn't all that unenjoyable. I handicap myself by not buying the parrot cards, and we're on much more even ground.

Other things I've played, with varying levels of success:

* CandyLand (taking turns and drawing a card and moving the right direction are new concepts!)
* The Ladybug Game (as boring as Candyland, but teaches counting)
* Chess (well... she at least knows how the pieces move now...)
* Go

"Design","t5_2qh78","I think people just have to be realistic. I agree that this is how it goes with cool jobs- but I think the reality is that all these people want the cool jobs, but only some of them are willing to weather the storm and make it pay. This is not really a field for someone who wants to exit school and plop right down into a job (though I'm sure there are exceptions- but I mean, in general). If you're freelance, you need to learn a lot more than just design (business stuff, how to spot a need for yourself and explain that need to the client, etc.), and if you're not freelance, you need to differentiate yourself. For example, if you're strong with design and also very strong with engineering- I imagine there are things you can do that I just can't do. When I want to use abstract diagrams as textures, I have to consult with people who know what they're talking about: you probably don't. So, right there, as a just plain old designer, you have the ability to quickly do work that I can't do: boom, differentiated. A lot of people have been talking about learning to code- if they REALLY learn to actually code (not just html and css, which everyone should just know at this point, at least have a solid grasp of it, anyway)- that's a huge additive. You can't just waltz into this field as a pure designer and expect to have things handed to you; I'm sure it still happens, sometimes, but that is great luck.  
  
Now, if you know all this already (the general ""you"", here), and you are still willing to do it and work your ass off: good. Your eyes are open. ","1367366867"

When these neurons start to die, you aren't able to easily access memories. As AD progresses further, you lose the ability completely. AD eventually atrophies parts all over the brain.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Mining Engineer here.

Although I am no expert in NYC building code, this question can be broken down with simple rock mechanics. Tunneling under skyscrapers would not be any different than tunneling under rock mass like we do in underground mines.

The force that the skyscraper is currently distributing through the ground and bedrock must be supported by the tunnel and transferred back into the ground.

    Weight of a skyscraper (Empire State Building): ~400,000 short tons
    Footprint of skyscraper: 80,000 sq. ft.

    400,000 * 2000 = 800,000,000 lbs.
    800,000,000 / 80,000 = 10,000 Psf = ~70 Psi = 160.9 ston/ft*s^2

Assuming bedrock is similar to the gneiss in New Jersey,

    Density = 0.105 ston/ft^3
    Acceleration (gravity) = 32.25 ft/s^2
    Spec. Weight = 0.105 * 32.25 = 3.38

    160.9/3.38 = 47.6 ft

If my beer math is right, the weight of the Empire State Building at a particular point underneath the foundation is only equal to an additional 47.6 ft of rock mass. In other words, adding the ESB to the mix is equivalent to digging the tunnel ~50 feet deeper. 

This weight is very easily supported in the design of the tunnels. Commonly it is a combination of rock bolting, meshing, and reinforced shotcrete. Like Vectoor said, you can build the tunnel wherever, as long as you can support it properly. The question you asked, however, was how much deeper you would build the tunnel to support the skyscraper. My answer is as shallow as possible, because then you dont have to support the additional weight of the rock above the tunnel as well. In practice, however, unconsolidated glacial till will inhibit you building the tunnel very close to the surface. Likely position for the tunnel is deep enough to avoid the piles upon which the skyscraper is constructed.

Also, the spectrum is not a continuum with religious zealots on one end and atheists on the other to cap it off.

also, the staining is probably from prolonged use of nail polish. you can prevent that by using a base coat under nail polish (i always use a coat of opi nail envy when i paint my nails) and you should be fine. you can also buff the stains away with a really high grit buffer. read this blog http://loodieloodieloodie.blogspot.com/ she has a lot to say about proper nail health and how to do things like buff your nails and file them. hope this helps!","1367366875"

Lion: *sigh*, I just don't get it. everyday is just the same god damn thing.  Last night I was talking to Bob, you remember Bob right?

Lioness: mhmm...

Lion: Well Bob seems to be having the time of his life! He's eating and pooping and sleeping, and he's loving it! I mean I do all that. There must be something that he has that I don't. But what could it be! 

Lioness: mhmm...

Lion: I mean, come on! We're talking about Bob here. I-I-I mean, it's BOB! Just look at him. He's such a slob. Does he even clean himself? He looks more like Tom. You remember Tom too right? He's that boar that you tried to eat last week. Or was that two weeks ago? ...Well Bob! Yeah doesn't he look more like Tom than us? I mean Tom is a fine looking guy but he's no lion. He has those stubby legs and funny looking nose. But yeah, Bob seems to love his life when he looks like Tom. I just don't understand.

Lioness: mhmm...

Lion: I just, I just think there more to life than just this. I'm not happy. I love my life and I can see that I have something good here, Heck it might even be great! But i'm not happy. I love eat those zebras and fighting those hyenas ever now and then just to give then a scare. 

Lioness: mhh..!!!!

At the mention of Zebra Lioness broke from her hunger trance and quickly scans the horizon for signs of prey. Disappointed she turns and glares at Lion as he continues talking without even breaking stride.

Lion: I know I should become a vegetarian! Yeah! That's what I'll do! I try being a zebra! 

Lion takes a bite of the grass by his feet.

Lion: *chew chew chew*...*spit* ughh that's disgusting. I don't know whats wrong with those zebras, Why do they this stuff so much? so being a zebra is out a of the question.

Lioness: *stomach growling*

Lion: No! I can't give up yet! I'll keep trying. Okay let's try acting like one for now.

Lion moves a few paces away and takes up a stance of a zebra. He mimics their action and begins eating grass again.

Lioness stares at Lion all the while and as her hunger grows so too does she lose her mind. Watching Lion play the part of a zebra her image of Lion slowly warps and suddenly before her stood a stupid talking zebra paying no mind to the hungry lioness before him. Lioness pounces on the zebra before and sinks her teeth into its hide. She tears him apart and sates her hunger.

In a nearby human civilization a metallic box with a figure that looks much like a clean figure of Lion wearing some sort of black hide speaks. ""Breaking News, Crazed Man killed and eaten by Wild Lioness""

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I don't understand what you mean by absolve. But I'll use myself as an example. One time, my girlfriend and I were having sex, and the condom slipped off. We were worried she was pregnant, but she ended up not being, so everything worked out. 

But assume she did end up pregnant. We were 20, in college, and far from grown ups ready to have a child. I'll be honest, before this happened I was pro-life except in extreme cases, but let's say everyone has their beliefs until they're forced to confront them. So, I would have asked that she either abort it or put it up for adoption. But this is her choice, I have no say. 

If she decides to keep it, I'm shit out of luck. I'd have to drop out of school denying myself an education as well as my career goals because an accident happened and the person involved made an irresponsible decision (she made some pretty bad decisions after we broke up). How is this fair to me? 

Then you get into the issue of child support, where the non-custodial parent needs to pay a decent amount of their income to support the child they didn't want. For a while I was living off of a graduate student salary that barely paid my bills. If I was making the same amount, likely if I hadn't gotten my college degree, I would not have been able to survive myself. This problem actually exists in the current system where fathers are still responsible to pay the same amount when they get laid off or otherwise lose a significant amount of their income. 

Not only this, but do you really think a guy will not build up resentments and cause problems when he's forced to support something that he doesn't want? Do you really think that kind of relationship is healthy for a child to have?

What often gets left out of this discussion is the social implications of LPS. Of course, if a man walks out on the mother of his child, he's going to be ostracized. It's the same that happens when women get abortions and you see those friendly protesters calling them scum. This is by no means a complete absolution of the consequences of sex.

Sometimes if you focus on what activities or common goals you have and work on cultivating those things instead of just ""hanging out"", the amount of time you spend together doesn't need to be nearly as much, and yet it can be so much more valuable and improve your friendship.  Maybe ""hanging out"" was fine before because you were just killing time in general, but now you have some other stuff going on that is important, so you have to figure out a new way, and its for the best. You sound like you're feeling spread very thin, and like you're going out of your way to make time for your friend- but have you considered that he might think all you are doing is killing time with him when you're not with your GF these days?  If he is important to you as a friend, you gotta just have a heart to heart and tell him that you're navigating some unfamiliar territory (that its nothing you're doing on purpose to hurt him), and that you don't feel the grief you're getting from him is warranted.  Ask him if he can help you figure out a new way to be friends that you can both get something really good out of.  If he can't provide any solutions, then he shouldn't be pointing out problems, and if you are good friends, you can figure this out no problem man. ","1367366879"

&gt;  As our Prophet(PBUH) has sent lanat on person who does not say darood, unless you believe that Hadith to be fake.

I believe it is a fake, since we know the sahabah commonly used to say ""rasool"" without adding the SAWS. it is not a sin. I don't believe the rasool of Allah sent la'na on his sahabah. 

Saying the salat on the rasool is an obligation. But there is no requirment that it be said every time he is mentioned.

&gt; 40 Hadith Nawawi &gt; Hadith

&gt; On the authority of Muadh bin Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him) who said:

&gt; I said, “O Messenger of Allah, tell me of an act which will take me into Paradise and will keep me away from the Hellfire.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “You have asked me about a great matter, yet it is easy for him for whom Allah makes it easy: worship Allah, without associating any partners with Him; establish the prayer; pay the zakat; fast in Ramadhan; and make the pilgrimage to the House.” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Shall I not guide you towards the means of goodness? Fasting is a shield; charity wipes away sin as water extinguishes fire; and the praying of a man in the depths of the night.” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) recited: “[Those] who forsake their beds, to invoke their Lord in fear and hope, and they spend (charity in Allah’s cause) out of what We have bestowed on them. No person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do.” [as-Sajdah, 16-17] Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Shall I not inform you of the head of the matter, its pillar and its peak?” I said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “The head of the matter is Islam, its pillar is the prayer and its peak is jihad.” Then he (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “Shall I not tell you of the foundation of all of that?” I said, “Yes, O Messenger of Allah.” So he took hold of his tongue and said, “Restrain this.” I said, “O Prophet of Allah, will we be taken to account for what we say with it?” He (peace and blessings of Allah be upon him) said, “May your mother be bereaved of you, O Muadh! Is there anything that throws people into the Hellfire upon their faces — or: on their noses — except the harvests of their tongues?” It was related by at-Tirmidhi, who said it was a good and sound hadeeth.

&gt; عَنْ مُعَاذِ بْنِ جَبَلٍ رَضِيَ اللهُ عَنْهُ قَالَ: قُلْت يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ! أَخْبِرْنِي بِعَمَلٍ يُدْخِلُنِي الْجَنَّةَ وَيُبَاعِدْنِي مِنْ النَّارِ، قَالَ: ""لَقَدْ سَأَلْت عَنْ عَظِيمٍ، وَإِنَّهُ لَيَسِيرٌ عَلَى مَنْ يَسَّرَهُ اللَّهُ عَلَيْهِ: تَعْبُدُ اللَّهَ لَا تُشْرِكْ بِهِ شَيْئًا، وَتُقِيمُ الصَّلَاةَ، وَتُؤْتِي الزَّكَاةَ، وَتَصُومُ رَمَضَانَ، وَتَحُجُّ الْبَيْتَ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أَدُلُّك عَلَى أَبْوَابِ الْخَيْرِ؟ الصَّوْمُ جُنَّةٌ، وَالصَّدَقَةُ تُطْفِئُ الْخَطِيئَةَ كَمَا يُطْفِئُ الْمَاءُ النَّارَ، وَصَلَاةُ الرَّجُلِ فِي جَوْفِ اللَّيْلِ، ثُمَّ تَلَا: "" تَتَجَافَى جُنُوبُهُمْ عَنِ الْمَضَاجِعِ "" حَتَّى بَلَغَ ""يَعْمَلُونَ""،[ 32 سورة السجدة / الأيتان : 16 و 17 ] ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أُخْبِرُك بِرَأْسِ الْأَمْرِ وَعَمُودِهِ وَذُرْوَةِ سَنَامِهِ؟ قُلْت: بَلَى يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ. قَالَ: رَأْسُ الْأَمْرِ الْإِسْلَامُ، وَعَمُودُهُ الصَّلَاةُ، وَذُرْوَةُ سَنَامِهِ الْجِهَادُ، ثُمَّ قَالَ: أَلَا أُخْبِرُك بِمَلَاكِ ذَلِكَ كُلِّهِ؟ فقُلْت: بَلَى يَا رَسُولَ اللَّهِ‍! فَأَخَذَ بِلِسَانِهِ وَقَالَ: كُفَّ عَلَيْك هَذَا. قُلْت: يَا نَبِيَّ اللَّهِ وَإِنَّا لَمُؤَاخَذُونَ بِمَا نَتَكَلَّمُ بِهِ؟ فَقَالَ: ثَكِلَتْك أُمُّك وَهَلْ يَكُبُّ النَّاسَ عَلَى وُجُوهِهِمْ -أَوْ قَالَ عَلَى مَنَاخِرِهِمْ- إلَّا حَصَائِدُ أَلْسِنَتِهِمْ؟!"" . 
رَوَاهُ التِّرْمِذِيُّ [رقم:2616] وَقَالَ: حَدِيثٌ حَسَنٌ صَحِيحٌ.



Muadh bin Jabal did not say the salat when he addressed the rasool in this hadith. Does this mean he is cursed by Allah?

Similarly when we read ""rasool"" in the the quran or in many places, we do not say the salat. Does it mean that every qari and ever muslim that prays is cursed unless they add the salat on every occurrence of the rasool?


How about the muezzin when he says ""muhammadun rasool allah"" in the adhaan does he say the salat on the rasool out loud? And if he does not is he cursed?

"BitcoinMining","t5_2skbb","I just ran through the relatively short wiki on scrypt, the algorithm LTC uses.  I'm not sure that hUMA will affect either currency's mining methods.

Scrypt was developed so that memory usage would increase the faster you work AND that the less memory you had would result in slower work.  The algorithm uses a large pseudo random data set in order to derive the key.  Each element can be generated individually, but this is very computationally expensive.

The work required still benefits heavily from parallel processing.  Thus, graphics cards that already have direct access to their faster-than-DDR3 memory (GDDR5) will not benifit from hUMA.  The CPU in an independent CPU/GPU configuration will not benefit greatly because it has a slow enough work speed that it is not limited by memory to the extend the GPU is limited.

When it comes to APUs implementing hUMA is where I cannot give much in terms of opinions.  L1,L2,L3 cache is much faster than GDDR5 but at the cost of much smaller storage sizes, but I do not know the feasibility of putting the scrypt dataset in one of these caches, the toll it would take on the system, or even how much the GPU of the APU would benifit.","1367366883"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","You're not living below your means, you're being responsible. Responsibility is hard, but by paying down your loans more rapidly you're putting your money to better use and buying yourself more peace of mind. Just remember though: the reason you're paying off the debt is so that you can enjoy life without it. You don't need to put your life on hold entirely, you just need to cut back until you've dug yourself out of that hole.

Definitely prioritize the loans over worries about a car. Car loans can be some of the lowest interest debt around (2%) and even if you don't qualify for those kinds of rates, you can still get much better rates than 9.75%.

If things do get too hard sometimes, don't be afraid to occasionally indulge when you reach milestones so long as it's rare (every $1000, twice a month, whatever) and the amount is relatively small ($20 dinner for two, seeing a movie, local sports game, etc.) It'll keep your fiance happier too and everything is harder if your home life is stressful.

Take a walk and bring your fiance with you if you can. It sounds ridiculous but walking regularly will help clear your mind and improve your mood. You can use that time to communicate with your fiance also about whatever is bothering both of you and figure out how to deal with it.

Talk to your fiance about the situation and work together on goals, but never when you're angry or tired as you'll be more likely to fight with each other.","1367366883"

It's a ""well..... you didn't say *not* to..."" sort of schtick. Unless there is evidence that they make you sick, it's not difficult to push it through into production. Of course, in most countries there's a few law fail safes against this, so if you're in a developed world you'll probably be OK, for the most part. But I'd be cautious, still, and try and eat things that have as little space between where they originate, and your plate, as possible.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","* In addition, wealth is unevenly distributed, with the wealthiest 25% of US households owning 87% of the wealth in the United States, which was $54.2 trillion in 2009. ^[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States) 

* The  total committed by the top 50 donors last year: $7.4 billion, down from the previous year’s total of $10.4 billion.

So 1% of 1% of the wealthy's money is donated and that is supposed to lead me to believe that they donate to charity? Heck since my number though is the top 25% how about I make that number ten times what is is so then the top 25% of the wealthy donates .1% of all their wealth every year.

So if we take a person who has the median amount of wealth 100,000 dollars then an equivalent donation would be a mere one hundred dollars a year. Yes, the wealthy really are carrying their weight aren't they?

So yes the wealthy do give to charity, and non withstanding extreme individuals like Warren Buffett and Bill Gates, they give far less proportionately than is within their means. Do not expect the generosity of those who have wealth to benefit the poor anytime soon.","1367366885"

""Gitmo will close, it is only a matter of time and whoever (President) closes it would claim that America is reclaiming its moral roots.  The people in the audience will clap, the media will broadcast the speech live and hail it as a great day in American history and if at all may take half a day to speak about some of the injustices committed by the US to these prisoners.  That would be the end of the story in the eyes of 90 % of the Americans.  As it is the end of story about the Iraq and Vietnam, Laos; Americans pulled out, well that should be enough to wash all the crimes that were committed by the American state.  A few years will pass and US will be targeted by another terrorist attack and 90% of Americans will question ""why do they want to kill us"" while American media will broadcast  ""they wish to take our freedom and liberty away"".

You are damn right, if you take innocent peoples (86 of the prisoners have been cleared by two administrations) freedom away for decades, they will want to take your freedom away.  Killed more than a million in Vietnam, 100,000 Iraqi's and many thousands in Afghanistan, again you damn right they would want to kill any and every American.  

We also know that, Gitmo should never have been opened at the first place and should be closed immediately, yet these politicians drag their feet.  Do you know why? Because they know that they will get away with it.  We all know that these politicians and many higher ups are criminals (Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, George W Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Barrack Obama (Yes Obama); yet they will walk away and continue to enjoy basic freedoms that they deprived many others as well as many privileges that 95% of Americans can only dream of.  Now how much role does ordinary Americans play in these atrocities, zero.  However, our government represent us or at least part of our population, it is especially true for democratic countries.   

Do remember, America or for that matter no other country hold any real moral higher ground, everyone is equally savage, its just a matter of available opportunities.  So next time our Government and media demonize someone by accusing them of committing unspoken-able crimes, tell them to look in the mirror.  Sometimes we really do reap what we sow.

"funny","t5_2qh33","&gt;Well OP, here's how you can help.

&gt;Don't spread attributed quotes on the internet unless you have checked them on Wikiquote first, Wikiquote being probably the most reliable source on the internet. Note that most internet quote sites are mostly unreliable and Reddit is almost completely unreliable.

&gt;By all means put up a funny saying, but don't add 'Carl Sagan', 'Einstein', 'Mark Twain' or 'Nikola Tesla' to the bottom unless you can be really sure that it's correct.

&gt;I know it's only r/funny, but by misattributing a quote, you are helping spread information to others.

&gt;Edit: BTW, Wikiquote tells me that your quote is probably misattributed.

Lauderdale. It's near pretty much everything worthwhile in Ft Lauderdale and has plenty of reasonably priced places, along with super expensive ones...I'd say the equivalent to Park Ave in Winter Park would be Las Olas in Ft. Lauderdale which is walking distance from Victoria Park. It doesn't have the quaint charm of Park Ave and is a bit more posh but thats just how South Florida is. 
You'll find cheaper places to live and hang out in Wilton Manors which is nice and of course known for its gay population. The music scene here is decent, a lot of bands come through the venues like Revolution downtown and you can drive down to Miami for some good shows too.

My advice would be to go with your gut and enjoy your time alone and getting to know yourself and overcoming whatever you think is holding you back becoming the best person you can be.

Becoming happy and satisfied with who you are is something I only learned to appreciate in my thirties and I look back on my twenties as a time that I needed to go through in order to do this. Don't overly worry because it doesn't make sense to you right now. Keep working on you and it'll come together and it'll happen without you realizing.

So, yes. It is normal to feel like you need to make a relationship work and this should be the case even in less serious relationships (some relationships don't have to last forever). This is how we learn to evaluate what we can offer and what we desire in return.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'm sure they could/can/will. One thing that would make this a little bit of a pain is that many images are stored as .jpg. Normally Google just sends the image file in whatever format it is in to the browser for it to render.   jpg files are not necessarily suitable for OCR as-is; the image would first have to be rendered in memory as a bitmap type of image. Presumably then the OCR'd text would be stored as metadata.  
  
And Google being Google, they'd probably want to do OCR into many languages while they were at it.    
  
And with a .gif file that contained animation you'd have to do OCR on every frame.      
  
But none of this sounds insurmountable, by Google standards. Doing it on all video content might be a bit too much right now, though. But it seems like something they would do eventually.   
   
Then taking it to the next level, why not index the web using voice recognition technology? Why not be able to search on every word or phrase that is spoken or sung on-line? In multiple languages, of course. 
  
It would be interesting to know how much of the web is text vs. images vs. video vs. audio vs. other.  Text indexing is very fast compared to OCR. And both are fast compared to speech recognition.   
   
As I write this, I become convinced that Google must be working on this. All of it. This is part of their core technology, and they don't shy away from big challenges.   
  
And realistically, some of this is by definition what the NSA *has* to be doing on telecommunications. They might also be doing it on the web's more static content.  Hell, they could be teaming with Google. Conspiracy theory time!","1367366910"

The ridiculous way council elections work and the naturally stretched nature of the UKIP vote has led most predictions of actual council seat share to be: CON 29%, LAB 38%, LD 16%, UKIP 11%. It's hard to be super accurate because there hasn't been an election since most of the UKIP vote materialised, so no-one can be too sure where it is.

And, also, if I've said this once I've said this a thousand times. If you cherry-pick your polls things will only end badly for you. At the moment, that Comres poll sticks out like a sore thumb, but we will see when other last minute polls come in. If you were paying attention to America in November you would've noticed that the Republicans cherry-picked their polls religiously to create the idea that it was a dead heat. In reality, as everyone who looked at the whole spectrum was predicting, Obama won comfortably. 

Not to mention by-elections, council elections and European elections are notoriously swing-y, in that there are often huge, last minute swings towards and away from parties, which of course can cut all ways, but it makes polls even more unreliable.","1367366912"

"austrian_economics","t5_2stjd","No, it is because aggregating heterogenous capital makes no sense at all! A pencil factory cannot be lumped into the same category as a pile of uncooked rice; both can be considered capital (though of differing order relative to consumption goods in the capital structure) but you can't just say ""we now have THIS much productivity"" from C+I+G.

How is consumption investment? Did you invest in the toilet water you last pooped in? The trash you threw out this morning?

How is govt spending investment? Govt inherently does NOT invest because it wants to deliver goods NOW to constituents, parties, special interest groups, POLITICIANS especially, etc. This isn't investment. Investment is when people PUT OFF having goods now in order to have MORE goods later. Sound like consumption or gubmint spending? No, it's the opposite. Why would you aggregate these? ""I guess if we just say it is!"" Okay bud.

the Austrian side of the model is showing how the interest rate and time preference for money alter the time structure of production. i.e. whereas idiots like Krugman think you get a liquidity trap, Austrians think you get a stimulus trap, where the more the interest rates are artificially lowered, the more you distort the natural calculation of the free market and misallocate resources (money, then capital, etc) then eventually you have to let the interest rates go back to normal, resulting in the ""bust"" that inevitably follows the ""boom"" that you created artificially with artificially low interest rates.

                             ** Round 1**

Packers over Giants-----------Colts over Steelers

49ers over Redskins--------------Texans over Ravens


                                 **Round 2**

Packers over Falcons----------------Broncos over Colts

49ers over Seahawks----------------Texans over Patriots 




                                **Round 3**

49ers over Packers------------Broncos over Texans





 **SUPERB OWL MOTHAFUCKA**.                                     **49ers beat Broncos in Super Bowl.**          


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So yea, that's my prediction. I feel like the only team that could stop the niners last year were the ravens, but now  the ravens are a bit weakened from retirements and trades, I think the niners with Kaepernicus, Crabtree and Willis are going to Disney World!            

Side notes: I feel like the AFC and NFC alternate with which one is superior every decade. In the 90's, The NFC Dominated, in the 00's the AFC Dominated, now I think the NFC is making a comback as it seems to have better teams than the AFC.

that being said; personally, i would go with request headers. unless the actual resource is at ""v1"" or whatever, the *resource identifier* seems to be the wrong place to put an *api version* specification. and the accept header is more geared towards content types; although there is a provision in the spec for extensions (e.g.: `level=1`), there isn't a whole lot of information out there regarding this.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Without Islam the Western civilization would've been effectively been finished off by Christianity. Without Muslims saving your precious Aristotle, there would've been no Aristotle to teach your idea of the Western civilization anything. Without the libraries that the Muslims kept, most of the Greek knowledge would've been effectively lost. Without the imperialists translating those text back from Arabic to Latin, the access to much of that information would not have existed to spur on Western civilization. Without Muslims carrying the torch of the Western civilization there would've been no Western civilization to speak of. Many disciplines were innovated upon by Islamic civilization, so to characterise every aspect of that civilization and paint it only in terms of its religious aspect is disingenuous. Not to mention that your evidence of al-Ghazli was rebutted right there and then -- it's just that his views were not popularized because dogmatic Muslims popularized al-Ghazli's views:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incoherence_of_the_Incoherence

You also have failed to show any significant knowledge of what you are criticising. In order to be in any sort of position to actually criticize Islamic civilization, you would have to spend a significant amount of time studying it. People who have studied it have a much more nuanced view of the subject. Islam is also much younger than Christianity and similar sorts of ideas of blasphemy and so on exited in Christianity and Judaism. In fact they are still on the books in Canada. In fact there are nut job Orthodox Jews that can be considered as bad as Muslims in their beliefs.

I am not trying to assassinate your character, you're doing it on your own. You have shown your have hatred for a people that you hide through claiming you have hatred for ideas. You have not particularly shown which ideas you have hated for, or that you even have an understanding of the ideas. You just have what seems to be a dogmatic hatred for Islam (perhaps informed by behavior of some Muslims?) -- that's all I can gather from our exchange; but you don't really understand what Islam even is, which leads to questions of whether or not you have hatred for the identity of certain people and wish to bring contempt upon them through your proselytizing of your dogmatic beliefs. So a question arises as to whether you have hatred for all people who hold a certain identity or a certain set of beliefs. I would personally recommend studying Islam more in depth, getting a less bigoted and more nuanced view of how Muslims can be brought into modernity. That's the only hope you have of not further your path into behaviors which are in essence illegal in many parts of the Western world.


&gt; I gave you one.

No you did not, you were writing a rebuttal to my claim that it was Plato and the article you reference specifically says, ""Together with Plato and Socrates (Plato's teacher), Aristotle is one of the most important founding figures in Western philosophy."" Therefore you at least failed to show that he was more important than Plato.

&gt; Plato didn't invent Empiricism. Aristotle did.

Empiricism does not define Western civilization. At this point in post-modernity, Empiricism is very much in question. Pre-Socratics had many similar ideas before him, he simply elucidated them. etc. etc.

&gt;  I believe in freedom of speech - I'm not oppressing you

There is the freedom of speech that KKK and Islamic fundamentalist believe in and then there is reasoned free speech that believers of modernity believe in, that's what I am speaking of. Your dogmatic views are more in line with unreasoned freedom of speech used by bigots to stir up the masses, then reasoned speech use to find the truth of the situation or rhetoric that finds better futures rather than paints people into dark corners of hell.

&gt; I'm an atheist - by very definition I'm devoid of religion.

Dogmatic, bigoted atheists can be as bad as religious bigots. Stalin is a great example. 

&gt; You've been apologizing for Islamic society since we began, trying to excuse their behavior with various platitudes about their socioeconomic problems or western imperialism. Put the blame where it originates: in their religion itself.

As mentioned Islamic society is not all bad. I was not apologizing for bad ideas and not implying that Islamic society never did anything bad, I was simply pointing out the other side of the argument... which is different from your dogmatic view of simply saying it's all bad, which is not true.

We lived in this very huddled together immigrant community, he was a first generation immigrant and I was a second. We were bored and stumbled upon this path behind a factory in our area, it led to down to this flat gravely area. We decided to keep the place as our little haven. We barbecued there by staring little fires and cooking hot dogs over the fire. Eventually we decided to build ourselves a little home there. We scavenged our neighbourhood for wood from old furniture and pallets left behind by trucks and built ourselves a little cabin. That cabin survived two years before it was torn down, and even after that we moved deeper down the gravely path into a valley and built a new cabin. It was no where near as impressive as the first but we made due. To this day me and my best friend still head down there to enjoy the peace and quiet and have ourselves a little bbq.

I don't think that just making it darker is the solution, I think you need to look at your use of colours in your highlights and shadows. Take a look at something like this and compare it to yours: http://charlesguice.com/images/portfolios/seaman/dark_ice/_05.jpg.

See how it's much more blue and the shadows are much more saturated? You may also want to consider uplighting your UI so that the top edge doesn't have such a bright highlight, it should give it more contrast with the game screen and might give it the impression of being darker than it is, whilst still allowing you to have the highlights you need to make it look like ice.

It's a common practice where audience laughter is modified to fit the moment to a producer's specifications. If the laugh is too quiet or short, a little bit of laugh track is thrown in to make it sound better or less awkward. Too long or loud and it fades out sooner than it really had. I imagine this was a similar situation, in all honesty.

That doesn't change the fact that it's still a good moment, mind you. It's just worth remembering that sometimes real life isn't quite that pretty.

I have two friends who live in that very same neighborhood.  One of whom is a very close friend.  We've already talked about the program, even.

&gt;These aren't people that ride around with chains, gold in their mouths, chrome rims, or any of that nonsense, these are real people who have to deal with the reality of living in a crappy part of town, where their apartments get broken into even if the only thing they have worth stealing is a CRT television.

Irrelevant and complete conjecture on your part.

&gt;How should they be more discrete? 

Google ""basic home security tips"", I'm sure you'll find some reading material.

&gt;What else should they do to secure their homes, since deadbolts on the doors don't seem to do the trick? Again, I'm not saying that your advice is bad, I'm saying that it isn't useful for people who can't afford the measures they don't already have in place.

More conjecture on your part.  They could, however, do something like a Neighborhood Watch, or a partnership program with HPD.  There's more than one way to skin the security cat.

&gt;I've never said that owning a gun would be my first course of action, nor have I said that my ownership of a gun would prevent crime from happening to me. 

I didn't say you said that, either.  I was pointing it out in reference to a hypothetical, as well as how it relates to the guy behind this program.

&gt;Quite the opposite, I said that the only factor affecting whether or not a crime is committed is the perpetrator's decision to do so. 

Which, in addition to not being true, has nothing to do with anything.

&gt;What I have or don't have has no effect on you, or your decisions.

What you have and do not have absolutely has an effect on other people and their decisions.  If you have stuff, and do not have it secured, then yeah, someone's decision to rob you might be influenced.

&gt;The whole point of education is to teach someone that there are better ways of attaining your goals than at the expense of another. Changing people is what prevents crime, not hoping that someone looking to commit robbery will skip my home if I've hidden all my stuff and put a good lock on the door. Sure, he might skip my place, but what about the person whose place he does hit? The crime still happened, just not to me. That's very different from preventing crime. In the event that someone is trying to break in to my place even though my doors are locked and I'm not showing off any of the wealth that I don't have, there's not much more that I can do if I'm only following your advice. What I can do is make sure that even though I'm not flaunting anything that I have, I do have a way to defend my family and myself in the event that your drunk/ high self decides that it would be worth it to try and break in anyway, just to see if there's anything worth stealing.

You're changing the subject again and diving off into non-sequiturs and policy debate, plus injecting weird hypotheticals to justify your line of thought in an argument against a point that no one brought up.  Kyle Coplen's idea, as it pertains to preventing crime, is about as effective as using Raid to prevent roaches.  Discussion over.  If you want to talk policy or philosophy, feel free to head on over to /r/politics.  I'm sure someone will be willing to take you up on the offer.","1367366934"

I went to CPS a few times. It didn't help me at first but the more I kept going the more I liked it. I get that this school knocks you down (and it happens to all of us) but you have to keep going. 

I don't know your name but I care about you. I care enough about you to have spent a few hours trying to find you on the Internet to make sure you know that someone is watching and someone cares. Do not ""tap out"". Do not hurt yourself. Do not think you are worthless. You are someone in this world and you have the potential to become anything you want to be. In about a month you will be walking out of Fitz Randolph gates and you will be a Princeton graduate for the rest of your life. Nobody can ever take that away from you. You hold that Princeton diploma up high.

You also didn't stumble into Princeton. You deserved it. I felt so bad my first few years here thinking I never should've gotten in and I was a mistake. However, you have to know that you are worthy of being here. Princeton saw something in you. While right now it may feel like Princeton has beaten you down, the admissions office saw something in you. I see something in you too. 

We don't have any more Urban Studies lectures so I don't know how I will find you but if I have to, I will do everything it takes to make sure you graduate and you hold your head up high. Keep going. It will all work out and one day you will look back on how you are feeling now and know that it was all worth it and it made you a better person. I promise.

I have had these canker sores (more accurately aphthous stomatitis) all my life.  My mother used to put Campho-phenique on them when I was a kid.  I don't really remember what it did, but it was never a cure.  I changed to a benzocaine-based gel in high school, and in undergrad I used Viractin that had an active ingredient of Tetracaine.  I can't find it anywhere now.  When I was in dental school I asked as often as I had the chance about the best way to manage these aphthous ulcers and what the cause of them was.  I heard the same thing over and over.  ""We don't know"" and ""they will heal in 7 to 10 days on their own"".

I get fields of ulcers when my stress levels rise.  I get one wherever I have some injury, like biting my lip or sharp foods cutting my gums.  I have tried professional strength acid burns, insulating waxy coatings, and medicated adhesives.  I have switched toothpastes.  I have taken doses of L-lysine.  

Nothing works.

Nothing.


Don't put alum or aspirin on your ulcer.  It just burns it and causes the wound healing to start at square one.  Don't rinse with peroxide or salt water.  Peroxide doesn't do squat anyway, and the salt water is effective against bacteria.


This isn't a bacteria problem.  It might be, but isn't proven to be, a viral problem.  It's not a diet or nutrition deficiency.  

The best management of these ulcers is to numb them with an OTC benzocaine to have relief for a while so you can eat.  ","1367366936"

"festivals","t5_2re9k","Hey there!!
I will start by saying that in 2011 I had been to my first American festival (I'm Canadian) and it was very intense and a little too scary for me. I went to Electric Forest in Michigan, I really wanted to see String Cheese Incident for my first time and what made me go was the amount of people who told me how good Rothbury was, so when I heard they were playing 3 nights in a row I HAD to go, I drove down from Ontario with some buddies and jumped in... little did i know that the majority of acts were electronic and dubstep. String Cheese BLEW MY FREAKING MIND but the electronic acts really brought some shady people to the festival and I learned one important thing about electronic festivals... people get FUCKED UP, like really really fucked up.... I'm not saying that I don't get messed up myself but I like music festivals for the music, atmosphere and the people. One thing Electric Forest had was amazing visuals everywhere in the concert area, the forest is lit up at night, there are tiny ""easter eggs"" hidden all over the place in the woods and it's a real strange trip to find them when yer trippin'. I hope anyone who loves EF and is reading this doesn't get too upset with me, it just wasn't my scene.

Being a little apprehensive about going to another American music festival I decided on something a little more relaxed, All Good. Let me tell you I had the best time I think I have ever had, the people, the music (last years line up was killer), the camping (you can choose to camp in the woods which we did and it was great, especially for the fact of not waking up with the sun beaming down on your tent). I will now be going to All Good every year I can afford it, I live in Saskatchewan now so it costs me a pretty penny to get down there, which I would hope says a lot about this festival. I understand it may be your first time, and a smaller festival may be a good starting ground, but I thing All Good feels like a smaller fest with a big crowd. There are 2 stages side by side, which means there are NO overlapping sets, one band finishes, the next band starts, you don't have to move and/or walk a mile to the next stage just to catch 30 min of a 1hour set by a band you didn't want to miss. I think the line up this year is awesome, but that's for you to decide. I only wanted to share my opinion, and I feel if you choose to go to All Good you will have the time of your life.

I have joined a small facebook group of people going to All Good who are dedicated to having a great time and are very positive people. We have a camp site that will be set up half way between GA camping and the concert grounds, kinda like a halfway camp where we can rest our legs, share stories, whatever... we even have a communal brunch on friday morning/afternoon and our own t-shirts... it's about 100 people so far and growing, I'm sure there will be flags, posters, and jokes all weekend with the people that are part of this group. If you're interested just PM me and I will share the info with you about the group. 

Good luck on choosing a festival and hope you have a GRATE festival season. Hope you don't mind that I wrote so much.

TL DR I didn't like the electric fest I went to and had a great time at All Good festival the following year.

EDIT: I just wanted to add something. If you can imagine: waking up to people laughing, you open your tent to a cool breeze and you're reminded that you are surrounded by trees and happy people. You wash your hands and face and eat a little breakfast, you decide to buy a wrapped in tinfoil brownie that a girl dressed like a fairy who was sitting at your campsite when you woke up for $5 after a long in depth talk about space. You eventually walk down to the concert area, through shakedown, smiling at everybody who passes by, pick a spot with your friends in the grass, put down a blanket and sit down... a bluegrass band starts after you were just handed a sweet smelling joint from some dude who said ""wanna finish this?"" ... starting to feel your relaxation you lean back on your blanket and drift away to the music.... this is just how your day starts at All Good.... at least thats how my fist morning did last year.... 

PS the brownie was awesome... I have never heard the Allman Brothers sooooo clearly!!! :)

This situation may have been dealt with with positive intentions, you know catching the terrorist, but the people making the calls behind that force still, at least in my mind, don't have the best of intentions in general.

"funny","t5_2qh33","That wasn't his main objective. That was after the invasion he switched tactics. I wrote a post about this before using the exact same transcript you posted, in another one of these ""TSA, terrorists have won"" rhetoric threads. Post below:

----

Technically, Osama bin laden himself stated 9/11 was to wake up the american people, commit an act so harsh towards actual Americans that they would ask ""why me?"" and research the situation. Eventually finding out that they had been attacked because of their countries foreign policy in the middle east. Removing American military bases from Saudi Arabia and cutting off support to  Israel. This did not happen, the exact opposite happened. Osama lost. Don't read that the wrong way, he did not care about you, he was not trying to get you to like him. He was trying to show the American people that if they stay indifferent to Americas foriegn policy in the middle east, they themselves will face direct consequences. This is why he switched tactics from the 90s from just attacking American military targets like the USS Cole, embassies etc, to a direct assault on the American people that was 9/11. He thought a direct assault on the people would wake them up to his demands, realize they are not that unreasonable, and vote in a government willing to change it. 

This as we know, did not happen. Most Americans didn't even bother to ask why it happened and just assumed it was all about religion and backed retaliation. Americas presence is bigger than it ever was in the middle east, and Israel still gets funded billions in military aid.

The Terrorists have not won. Their goal wasn't for you to get patted down in an airport ffs. The goal wasn't even to ""terrorise"" you into living in constant fear where the word terrorist comes from. Their goal was to get you to rise up against your own government to make sure this never happened again.

So no, the terrorists lost, the american people lost, the only winner is the actual US government who got more control, both over it's own people and the people of the middle east.

This whole ""The terrorist won"" talk every time the government crosses the line cheapens the actual complexity of the situation, and proves that people have no idea what the fuck went on and why in the first place.

For those interested here are some Osama Bin Laden quotes after 9/11. Stating his goals and his reasons. These are all in his videos that he released, but the American media cherry picked just the quotes that promised another attack, rather than the reason behind them. He even moans of this.


*Osama mocking Bushes 'They attack us because they are jealous of our freedom' line:*

* ""Before I begin, I say to you that security is an indispensable pillar of human life and that free men do not forfeit their security, contrary to Bush's claim that we hate freedom. If so, then let him explain to us why we don't strike for example - Sweden? And we know that freedom-haters don't possess defiant spirits like those of the 19 hijackers. No, we fight because we are free men who don't sleep under oppression. We want to restore freedom to our nation, just as you lay waste to our nation. "" - Osama Bin Laden.

*Again reaffirming that 911 was get the Americans to question its route cause:*

* ""No one except a dumb thief plays with the security of others and then makes himself believe he will be secure. Whereas thinking people, when disaster strikes, make it their priority to look for its causes, in order to prevent it happening again."" - Osama Bin Laden

*Osama getting pissed that the majority of Americans are still ignorant about the reasons, stating he is ""amazed at you"":*

* ""But I am amazed at you. Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes. And thus, the reasons are still there for a repeat of what occurred."" - Osama Bin Laden

*Probably the most insightful statement into Osamas psyche, is the reason he became an anti-American terrorist in the first place.*

""I say to you, God knows that it had never occurred to us to strike the towers. But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind.

The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that. This bombardment began and many were killed and injured and others were terrorised and displaced. 

I couldn't forget those moving scenes, blood and severed limbs, women and children sprawled everywhere. Houses destroyed along with their occupants and high rises demolished over their residents, rockets raining down on our home without mercy.

The situation was like a crocodile meeting a helpless child, powerless except for his screams. Does the crocodile understand a conversation that doesn't include a weapon? And the whole world saw and heard but it didn't respond.

In those difficult moments many hard-to-describe ideas bubbled in my soul, but in the end they produced an intense feeling of rejection of tyranny, and gave birth to a strong resolve to punish the oppressors.

And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.

And that day, it was confirmed to me that oppression and the intentional killing of innocent women and children is a deliberate American policy. Destruction is freedom and democracy, while resistance is terrorism and intolerance."" - Osama Bin Laden.

*His acceptance as 'the villian' so to speak, his acceptance of being labelled a terrorist:*

* ""So with these images and their like as their background, the events of September 11th came as a reply to those great wrongs, should a man be blamed for defending his sanctuary? Is defending oneself and punishing the aggressor in kind, objectionable terrorism? If it is such, then it is unavoidable for us."" - Osama Bin Laden

*In response to Bush invading Afghanistan and now Iraq, Osama while explaining what happened to the soviets says he'll retaliate by bankrupting America*

* ""So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy. Rather, the policy of the White House that demands the opening of war fronts to keep busy their various corporations - whether they be working in the field of arms or oil or reconstruction - has helped al-Qaida to achieve these enormous results."" - Osama Bin Laden, 2004


*Explaining to the American people that they are the real losers:*

* ""...but on the other hand, it shows that the Bush administration has also gained, something of which anyone who looks at the size of the contracts acquired by the shady Bush administration-linked mega-corporations, like Halliburton and its kind, will be convinced. And it all shows that the real loser is ... you."" - Osama Bin Laden

*Rambling about Americas dealing in the middle east again as the reason 'your allies in palestine' is Israel:*

* ""Be aware that it is the nation who punishes the weak man when he causes the killing of one of its citizens for money, while letting the powerful one get off, when he causes the killing of more than 1000 of its sons, also for money. And the same goes for your allies in Palestine. They terrorise the women and children, and kill and capture the men as they lie sleeping with their families on the mattresses, that you may recall that for every action, there is a reaction."" - Osama Bin Laden

*Again reaffirms that he wants the American people to hold the government responsible for their policy in the middle east, directly linking it to 911.*

* ""Among the most important of what I read in them was some prose in their gestures before the collapse, where they say: ""How mistaken we were to have allowed the White House to implement its aggressive foreign policies against the weak without supervision."" It is as if they were telling you, the people of America: ""Hold to account those who have caused us to be killed, and happy is he who learns from others' mistakes."" And among that which I read in their gestures is a verse of poetry. ""Injustice chases its people, and how unhealthy the bed of tyranny."" As has been said: ""An ounce of prevention is better than a pound of cure."""" - Osama Bin Laden.

*And a very simple warning from him:*

* ""In conclusion, I tell you in truth, that your security is not in the hands of Kerry, nor Bush, nor al-Qaida. No. Your security is in your own hands."" - Osama Bin Laden

"firstworldproblems","t5_2sa5n","In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn’t do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.

An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they’d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.

My mother’s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He’s not particularly successful as an engineer, but I’ve met lots of other engineers who aren’t as good as me at physics, so I’m guessing that’s not just a result of him being bad at it.
I’m also pretty good at engineering. I don’t have a degree, and other than physics I don’t have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan).

I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I’ve come across. Every question of existentialism which I’ve seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven’t been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I’ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.

Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there’s no aspect of psychology which I don’t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud’s theories.
I’m a good enough writer that I’m writing a book and so far everybody who’s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that’s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I’ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it.
I don’t know if that will suffice as evidence that I’m intelligent. I’m done with it, though, because I’d rather defend my maturity, since it’s what you’ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.

I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn’t just faking it, I’d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self’s actions, it shouldn’t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.
I don’t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren’t harming others. I don’t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others – but I don’t care what a person’s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them). I don’t have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to, or clothes they wear, etc. I know that’s not really an impressive moral, but it’s unfortunately rare; a great many people, especially those my age, are judgmental about these things.
I love everyone, even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile,
piece of shit human being, deserving of zero respect, but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.

I’m pretty much a pacifist. I’ve taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution, because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time I’ll fight back is if 1) the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and 2) if I don’t attack, I’ll come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words, if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me, I don’t fight back. I’ve therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious, because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that I’m never in a situation where I’ll be worse off after a fight. If I’m not going to get any hospitalizing injuries, I really don’t care.

The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then, I’ll do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them, I’d prefer to do that over killing them.

I consider myself a feminist. I don’t believe in enforced or uniform gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it’ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit “women are crazy” circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don’t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren’t awesome.

That doesn’t mean I look for places to victimize women, I just don’t believe it’s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything’s OK when it’s really not (and that’s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that).

I’m kind of tired of citing these examples and I’m guessing you’re getting tired of reading them, if you’ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I’m pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times, and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivational/inspirational quote was, and that comment was second to the top, so I guess other people agreed (though, granted, it was a pretty low-traffic post, only about a dozen competing comments).

Another example is not caring or just caring some about people getting killing by war in the third world while reacting completely different if it happened in your own country, it's all about context. Maybe someone in the first world really cares a lot about the third world but almost no one does to such a degree.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","I'm not an avid MMO player because I don't like subscriptions nor do I like feeling like I'm being nickel and dimed, so take this how you will.  Personally I feel like if I pay a base price and a subscription, that's it--I paid the monthly fee of $10~ and I know that everything is available to me and I started at the same starting point as everyone else.  I feel that paying up front will provide me a fuller experience and not having to worry about what I might be missing will allow me to enjoy the game to the fullest.  

In contrast, I feel like with f2p games, I can only enjoy them as much as I am willing to spend.  By that I mean, I know they *could* be played for free, but in the back of my mind I'm thinking 'well, I could go without an extra bag, or a bunch of gold, a nice weapon, or not visit a new area of the map...or I could just pay a few bucks'. The whole experience goes from a game and a product I paid for to something closer to a drug deal.  It's fun now...but it could be more fun if I just pay a little more.  If that's true, then I can see it being a slippery slope.  A few bucks here, and a few bucks there.  Pretty soon, I'm invested in this game and paying a larger sum of money for a larger bag or more gold only makes sense.

You might say that I lack self control and maybe that's true, but isn't that the point of this model?  I'd bet you've heard the term ""whale"" when they describe people with massive amounts of cash to spend on f2p games.  You're right, the developers do deserve to get paid.  The whole system just feels gross to me though.  I'm not saying you or anyone else is wrong for liking f2p games; just wanted to give you some insight since you said you don't understand the thought process.","1367366956"

Let me explain. 
This was about 3 years ago, I was spending the summer at my grandparents farm. There's not a lot to do on a farm, outside of mischief and just wandering. So, here I am, about 14 and the house is hot. I can't sleep. So, little preteen brain decided to go wander around the farm at 4am. After a while, I'm not sure exactly, I ended up at the far barn. There are three on my grandfather's property, and  this one is not in use. Kentucky has more barns than it needs, due to the decline of the tobacco industry, but I digress. So I just mosy on inside, and then we lock eyes. 
It's hard to describe, but it looked something like if you were to put a dog, a deer, and a man togther using scissors and glue. It was dark, but I could make out the it's head was about two feet higher than it should have been. The forearm of one side extended about a foot further than the other, and ended with an upturned paw. A man's face, only not. Like a dogs lower jaw. It was just so wrong. I couldn't look away, and it didn't move much either. I stared for a while and then bolted. I ran so far fat little me almost had a heart attack. 
I know it sounds like bullshit, but thinking back on it still gives me chills. I dream about it sometimes. ","1367366957"

     (2)  Left turns.  The driver of a vehicle intending to turn left at any intersection shall approach the intersection in the extreme left-hand lane lawfully available to traffic moving in the direction of travel of such vehicle, and, after entering the intersection, the left turn shall be made so as to leave the intersection in a lane lawfully available to traffic moving in such direction upon the roadway being entered.  Whenever practicable the left turn shall be made in that portion of the intersection to the left of the center of the intersection.

     (3)  The director of transportation and the counties in their respective jurisdictions may cause official traffic-control devices to be placed within or adjacent to intersections and thereby require and direct that a different course from that specified in this section be traveled by vehicles turning at an intersection, and when such devices are so placed no driver of a vehicle shall turn a vehicle at an intersection other than as directed and required by such devices.

3.  Is there racism in the south?  Uh, yes.is there racism everywhere?  Uh huh.
4.  Speaking as a native Californian (my Obstetrician was Dr. Mellow. How California is that?) institutional racism may not have been legal but all you had to do was attend the prom at just about every school south of Marin County and you could see the racism.  Hell, read the paper today.  How about that Compton Cookout?  
5.  The largest, most violent bussing riots took place in...wait for it...Boston.  
6.  In eight very short years the wonderful folks in Germany  managed to murder twice as many folks as we're ever subject to slavery in the U.S..  I guess that doesn't count cause they picked on everyone.  How about our friends, the Canadians?  Not too many mixed parties going on with those Native Peoples, last I looked.  None of the northeast could have grown and prospered except for turning to the virtual enslavement of the immigrant classes.  Where would California be without the Heathen Chinaman?  How about all that coal mined by waves of Polish immigrants and white southerners?

We all agree racism is stupid but we ALL are racists.  The difference is that it is quie acceptable to denegrates and mock southerners because they are definitely racists, aren't they?  They are all stupid and inbred, right?  The kids all have rickets and live in shacks and hate everyone not like them, right.

Go ahead and downvotes this to oblivion.  At least I am honest about where I come from and can see our faults.  If you think you or your friends got there without stepping on some downtrodden, you just aren't honest.

For outdoorsy stuff, I'd say you're probably better of flying into Brisbane (ORD-DFW-BNE or ORD-LAX-BNE) or Cairns (ORD-NRT-CNS).  Not only do you have access to the Great Barrier Reef (at least in the northern end of the state), but you have the better climate.  If you're looking to avoid winter, there's nothing better than Queensland.  

&gt; I'm not sure what transportation options are like in Australia, but I'm sure we'll probably rent a car and need lodging. The camper option does sound interesting though, as least for a few days.  Right now I'm thinking of November as a good time to go. 

November is the start of our summer and high tourist season, so if you're going to book a camper, I'd book NOW.  Depending on the type of person you are, you may find [Wicked Campers](http://www.wickedcampers.com.au/) are the way to go, however beware that the vans are *painted* very tackily, and you will draw a stare wherever you are.  They're cheap, they run well, and they have a bed in the back.  what more can you need?

Otherwise, most places you will stay along the way will have a few hotels or pubs that you can stay in.  Most of our country pubs also offer accommodation, albeit nothing flash.

&gt; And thanks for the tip about the RSL, I do love gambling so gambling areas would be fun!

By gambling areas, that just means poker/slot machines.  There are casinos in Brisbane, Cairns, and Townsville though.","1367366960"

"OkCupid","t5_2rct2","Men can't be feminists. 

To answer the question in your title, you have to ask yourself what feminism is. You can say it's ""gender equality,"" but that's so general as to be meaningless. The reality is there are a lot of different feminist theories each with their idea of how to achieve gender equality and with their own ideas of gender/sex/sexuality. There are radical feminists, sex-positive feminists, and even pro-life ""feminists"" (see Palin, Sarah). 

So there really is no one thing that makes any one of these theories feminism save for the fact that they've originated with women. Men can't (and probably shouldn't) define what feminism is and since that definition can vary from woman to woman, I really see no point in dudes defining themselves as such. It's essentially like a white person trying to be a black nationalist.

For the record, every woman I've dated has labeled themselves as feminist. A few have been more vocal about it than others. None of them had the exact same views on the stuff I mentioned above.","1367366961"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have a kind of relevant story. Myself and a few friends went to stay with some people outside of Daytona, FL.  They let us stay at their cabin about 45 or so minutes away from the airport there.  The place was off the freeway, and about 15 minutes drive down a dirt road.  It was a funny little place, built on stilts because it was near a lake (or glades, what have you), and the area would flood during heavy rains.

Anyways, the first night the four of us were staying there, I had a hard time sleeping.  It was a pretty landscape, and was really quiet out there, but I just couldn't sleep.  That's when I heard the faint sound of drumming.  It was constant, somewhere around 130-140 bpm, so kind of fast.  I thought it was just in my head, but it seemed to get ever-so louder, and I couldn't shake the image of people dancing around a fire to the beat.  At first I thought I was just imagining things, the way that you might as you drift in and out of a light sleep.

""Are those flutes?"" One friend asked.  ""Yes,"" was the reply from the room over.  We sat in silence after that, listening to the drumming.

The next day, we didn't have much to do, so we explored the area for a bit.  The drumming started again.  We tried to chase after it, but it seemed no matter how far we would go in any direction, the drumming never got louder--until we got back to the cabin.

Now, we were there to do some spiritual work (we thought those we were staying with had a legitimate lineage, but we later found out they taught ""shit I made up), and there were different locations dedicated to different spirits.  Well, there was one particular spot that was the ancestral shrine, and everyone who stayed there would give gifts and prayers to their ancestors in that spot.  And wouldn't you guess, that's where the drumming became loudest.

It was nothing creepy, to be honest.  In a way, it was kind of comforting, but I can't exactly say why.  Maybe it's because the four of us had experienced some weird shit in the past, and this didn't seem to be all that weird.  Maybe it's because I've had paranormal run-ins in the past, maybe not, but I actually liked the music, and the images of some people dancing around a bonfire to its beat was a beautiful thing to imagine.

We asked the people we were there to see about it, and it turns out that spot of land was a point of conflict between the natives that called it their home, and groups of runaway slaves.  Previous people had mentioned the drumming, but those who owned the land had never experience it.","1367366965"

But it's Discovery's #1 show, and you gotta get those 18-35 males in, so titties, explosions and gunfire. 

I mean it doesn't change anything, the show is still what it is, but knowing the cast are all aware of how dreck their work is makes it somewhat more swallowable. Hopefully when the thing's on the verge of crashing and burning, they hand back creative control before outright cancellation. Who knows though?","1367366967"

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","Dream Stream/Spinny Mountain/Charlie Meyer's Statewild Area is one of the best fisheries the entire state has to offer and is pretty famous among western tailwaters, especially during April and Sep-Oct when monstrous rainbows and browns come up out of 11-Mile Reservoir.  The summer is the best time to fish it during the PMD/Caddis/Trico hatches which can literally last all day in an overlapping manner.  

There's plenty of structure in the water for the fish, but they are definitely wary due to pressure and the bank structure...you'll scare up more big fish than you catch until you learn to tread softly and spot/stalk big fish.  

If you've never been, it's worth the trip.  I'd suggest waiting until spring ends (winds are a constant battle in South Park, especially during this time of year) and check the local reports (South Platte Fly Shop, Peak Fly Shop and Angler's Covey) for when the hatches are coming off steadily.  Hopefully the DWB will be releasing decently with this snowpack so flows in the high 100's to 200's may be possible, as this is when the river fishes at its absolute best.  

Here's a great video with one of the state's top guides:  [Landon Mayer @ the Dream Stream](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGG0DE_oQwQ)

"keto","t5_2rske","Ok, umm... after reading a lot of your responses I am less than optimistic for you. Let me clarify that I am hopeful for you and I really do hope it works out. I don't know you or anything but I am highly familiar with the kinds of logic you are using and I don't see it leading to good things. You seem to have a lot of obstacles to doing this successfully.  I like that people are being supportive but nobody is asking the tough questions, so I will.




1. Saying you're gonna start next week? Its only tuesday.  This gives you time to do the whole ""last supper"" thing and totally pig out this week, mitigating any results you might see when you do begin. This will also make it that much harder for you to get into ketosis. 




2. You said money is tight and a FOOD BANK is helping you? I'm sorry but this is not a diet for people who can't afford basic necessities. You have no control over what a food bank is going to give you.  They are going to give you canned/processed non-perishable items, not the amounts of fresh eggs and meat you'll be needing.  This just boils down to beggars can't be choosers. The amount I have spent on food since starting this diet has shot up about 5 fold from before. I'm not saying you can't do this on a budget but come on... the food bank??  You mom is supporting you as well. Is she going to be consistent in this?  Buying more fresh foods means more trips to the grocery store. Is she going to be able to do this 2-3x a week if you need it?  You asked if ketostix are necessary for this. During induction, YES.  




3. ""Literally my old eating habits revolve around a microwave or already prepared.""  you mentioned that all you have had is ""boxed"" food. Do you have all the cooking utensils, pots/pans you are going to need for this? What about all that food that's lying around your house right now? Isn't it going to be a temptation for you?



4. You sure do mention your health problems a lot. What's going to happen when you're two days in and having keto flu complete with chest pain, headaches, fatigue, etc?  Are you going to end up in the ER again? Can you even afford to end up in the ER? 


My point is that your mind needs to go on a diet too. You need to get yourself in the right place in your life to start this.  If you really are at that point now then I wish you all the best.  I am glad that you realize MAJOR changes need to be made in your life, my suggestion is that you ease yourself into this starting TODAY.  At the very least, you can start by limiting your calories.   PS I too, suffer from anxiety induced trich, so I feel ya. Since starting keto I have not pulled once, but I have no idea why.

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","So I'm really unfit. First we went through a couple of stretches for 5 minutes or so to loosen some muscles up, then she took me through a few body weight type things to start moving the muscles that I'll be using for lifting. I know so little of my own anatomy, what muscles I should be using when lifting, what my muscles are called or what the exercises are called... Heh. But basically we did some squat-type things, some lunge type things, some pull down weight thing and some barbell bench lift things. All low-no weight stuff but that should change quickly. Lots of focusing on tightening my ""core"" muscles and pinching my shoulder blades together. 

I think it's a good start, and at the very least I'm getting more comfortable just being in the gym! 

My goals are still pretty murky. I want to look and feel better, I want to fit in to clothes better... They were probably the biggest motivators to begin with. After this session though, I really just want to be able to do basic things like jog for 10 minutes without feeling like I might die, or be able to go rock climbing or play a sport without it being an ordeal. 

Firstly though, I don't want to be a fat weird blob when I get married in August! I started fixing my diet about a month ago, all I did was start eating breakfast and lunch... I used to have a smoke and a coffee first thing in the morning and at lunch and wouldn't eat until I got home. Of course by then I had no energy so I'd pig out on crap and beer. Just by forcing myself to eat breakfast and lunch I started making my own dinner, which is leading to making my own lunches and better breakfasts. I've lost 7 kilos already without even hitting the gym. 

So yeah, I have high hopes! ","1367366975"

Salaffiyah is not a new sect, new mathhab, neither a new way! Salaffiyah is based upon Quran, Sunnah, and the the understanding of the righteous predecessors, so we don't have a different salah from the Sunnah. We do follow the four imams of the mathaheb as longest they have proofs.

I don't know if there's an easy guide, but here's a playlist of verdicts regarding salah:

A) I understand it, but I can't figure out how to explain it clearly to someone who doesn't have the same background that I do.

B) I don't understand it clearly, but I'm too much of an ass to admit it to you.

C) It is too difficult for me to explain the subtleties without comparing it to one or more experiences that I know you have not been exposed to.

EDIT: This bothered me a lot as well when I was younger. Not so much now.

"business","t5_2qgzg","I remember when the dotcom explosion happened in NYC and I was a creative director for a German design firm and we had a lot of clients in Silicon Alley.

My two most memorable moments:

1) We were brought in for logo tipo, everything from Logo to Letterhead and even Corporate Philosophy Design, which was a thing then. (Side note here, we used a random generator to make these Core Company Beliefs and got paid.)

So we go in, we get the font family they like, color swatches, and so forth, and then I asked, ""What is your product exactly, because I can't figure it out. Maybe we can work that into the logo.""

And I will never forget this, their CIO said, ""We don't have a product yet, we are working on the marketing of brand.""

My Art Director, almost jumped out of his chair and asked, ""How many people work here?""

CIO: ""91.""

I got our money in the form of a casheirs check from their bank, they were pretty uppity about it, saying we should take their options because we'd make more money that way.

They burned through 20 million in IPO money in salary and facilities, AND NEVER HAD A PRODUCT.

2) After the crash, I lead a team that did Investor Resolution. We got to take a rather swanky office in the Grand Central, 40ish floor, complete with views of the Chrysler Building hubcap gargoyles. Those are pretty awesome btw. 

Anywho, the offices if I remember correctly were former dotcom marketing specialists and there was swag everywhere. Any type of swag imaginable. We found these branded putting greens and proceeded to set up a 9 hole putt putt golf course complete with whimscal swag making it those you see at family fun centers.

We'd bring in investors of various failed dotcoms for their resolution checks and play 9 holes while we talked how the figures were arrived at. The worst one I saw then, which pales to OP's tale, was an initial investment of just over 700k and I was giving him a check for $150.00.

I dont miss those days. ","1367366983"

"exchristian","t5_2r95q","You have been told your whole life that purpose in life comes from a belief in god.

In reality, humans decide what purpose they have in life.  There are depressed Christians/atheists/Buddhists/Hindus/Muslims and there are happy Christians/atheists/Buddhists/Hindus/Muslims.  Your views regarding faith (or lack of it) have little to do with your ability to be happy or to have a sense of purpose.  In my personal experience, I can say I experienced a lot of negative criticism from Christians when I left the church, but I have come out the other end of the tunnel a better person.  I enjoy my life 1000 times better as an atheist than as a Christian.  Also, my dating and social life definitely took a turn for the better.  I'm pretty sure I only get this one life, and to me, that makes me all the more want to use it well.  Life, to me, is primarily about the experiences.  If I die, that's it.  There's nothing to experience in being dead.  I was dead for billions of years before I was born, it doesn't seem to have caused me any inconvenience.  Just the fact that you are a human and live in a 1st world country means you have quite a lot of opportunities.  Find something you enjoy or want to do in life and then do it.  Don't wait for happiness or success to fall into your lap, work hard at making those changes in your life yourself.  Steer away from being in Christian-rich environments, they are just going to try to reinforce all the ideas they had been selling you your whole life, and that message is miserable to hear when you already know it's a scam and a placebo.  Branch out and see the world through someone else's eyes.  Give yourself permission to play-act a person who isn't you but that you would like to be.

Don't let fear control who you are or what you think.  If you ever feel like things get too hard in life, tell someone.  Leaving your faith will have it's baggage, but from someone who went through that experience, I can promise that there is a good chance you can emotionally overcome it all.  The biggest factor in overcoming those feelings you are having is *you*.  It's not enough to just live and think as you normally do.  You need to objectively take a look at the patterns of thinking you have and the patterns of behavior you have and you need to take action to improve on your behaviors that are harmful to you.

After inquiring where the monocles are actually produced, we traced the sub-consulting trail to a low-skilled rhesus monkey in Bangladesh. Reports indicate the monkey has been moonlighting as a plumber in his spare time, and simply didn't really give a shit about making monocles  anymore, citing that for only two bananas per week - what the fuck did the main contractor expect.","1367366988"

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","That's an unfair comparison...let's put it this way: for a budget build, the 965 is still an awesome CPU (10% performance bonus when overclocked included), and paired with a modern graphics card (up to GTX 660), it still can produce good framerates (when the game isn't CPU heavy). That being said, the 3570 is - kind of - unchallenged when paired with a GTX 650 Ti Boost: a balanced build it would be (YODA ?) when paired with a GTX 670 / 680.

2. It pisses them off even more when you don't let them get to you - kinda roll with a deal with it attitude.

3. As angry as I was - having control over rage let's you live a better life. At least I was able to make a LPT test and apply it right?

A half century ago in this country, blacks were born with broken spirits and told they couldn't be anything better than even the worst white man. Blacks had to come together and remind themselves that they were not the image that the white man had created of them, they needed to be told they could be proud, and stand equal with the white man. 

Now there are many living and dead examples of successful black people for kids to look up to, hence it's not as necessary for black kids who grow up in america to be told they can be a functional and productive member of society.. but you better believe that if little black kids lose their spirit because mean people want them to feel inferior, they will remind that person that he should be proud of his race.","1367366992"

Perhaps I am a bit over the top -- but what I'm most concerned about is that people don't get stuck in the same trap that I did -- that is ""I'll buy this for cheap now -- and it'll go up in value and I'll have no problems flipping in 2 years when I'm ready to move on"".

While yes, the housing market is appreciating -- it's never going to go back up to where it was during the bubble years -- at least not compared to GDP. How could it? 

At best, you can hope that your house maintains it's value (or perhaps improves based on work you do, etc) compared to inflation in the long term. 

On top of it only keeping pace with inflation, there are additional costs that come along with home ownership -- replacing windows, siding, roof, painting, etc etc etc. 

Hence my view of it being a depreciating asset. Maybe not in terms of the number of dollars (thanks to inflation) -- but the fact that housing historically keeps pace with inflation plus the fact that there are upkeep/tax costs associated with owning -- is where I'm getting that view from.","1367366992"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Well, I agree in principle, but that wasn't practical for a handful of reasons, chief among them being that a repeal simply wouldn't have passed in the election.

The way Amendment 64 was written in Colorado was the result of professional electioneers doing polling, focus grouping, and strategy planning. It was designed to pre-emptively rebut prohibitionist arguments. Instead of simple repeal, it provides a vision of how marijuana would be sold, and it would be modeled after Colorado's liquor laws: special stores, no sales to unaccompanied minors, legal to give away but not sell, etc.

Now, I personally think alcohol is over-regulated. I think it's dumb that it's technically illegal for a recovering alcoholic to auction off his wine collection on eBay to pay for rehab. But the political reality is that in order to *sell* legalization to Colorado's wider electorate, you have to trust some professional electioneers who know how to win elections. And we did. And we won.

Just as importantly, Amendment 64 cannot be undone by the legislature, or any city or town. That would not be true of simple repeal. Colorado is a home rule state, so any city or county could have imposed prohibition on a local level. The state legislature could have just voted to undo the repeal. Amendment 64, on the other hand, affirms that you have a *statewide* right to grow, consume, possess, transport, and give away marijuana. It overrides all other state or local laws, which is important.

Amendment 64 was designed to do three things: (1) Affirm the individual *right* to use marijuana, (2) make that right state-wide and overrule any local governments, (3) get passed.

Simple repeal would not have accomplished any of those goals.","1367366995"

Feeling like shit of course, the love of my life was dead and gone.  And I fell into sleep.  And then I woke up.  And she was there on the bed with me.  I wrapped my arms around her, and felt her snuggle into me.  And I just began to cry, and sob hysterically.  I saw her, I felt her, she was breathing.  And then I closed my eyes, and she was gone.

Ghost?

Weird brain phenomena? (This was before I was diag'd as bipolar, but I'd never had hallucinations)

You will not have to keep buying newer ones, assuming you take the classes back to back or before the classes update the book.  If you use Kieso as reference to help study for the CPA, as others have said very little might change from now until you are at that point in your life.  However, and despite what I said about downloading the book, I may or may not sell my 14th edition (my school might still be using it next year) and buy the 15th or 14th edition eBook.

However,  I did want to point out that in Australia we have plenty of discussion about bike safety and how to promote bike use, and almost no debate about helmet laws. In an odd way, our experience proves the point of the article. 

If you're invested in debating helmet laws then go ahead,  but I agree with the article - all this angst over helmets is a distraction from the real issues.   &amp;#12494;( &amp;#94;_&amp;#94;&amp;#12494;)

We take every customer complaint seriously, and respond as quickly as possible. We are currently cooperating with local law enforcement and media outlets.

We take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety and comfort of our customers. We are the first and only cab company in Richmond that utilizes closed-circuit cameras in every vehicle, including the vehicle in which the alleged assault occurred.

As soon as we became aware of this complaint, we reviewed the pertinent video. The video does not show the alleged assault. It does show that the cab driver picked up two passengers in violation of local law and company policy. As a result, his relationship with Napoleon Taxi has been terminated effective immediately.

The video also shows both passengers conversing amicably, discussing among other things where they work. The passenger who issued the complaint invited the second passenger to visit her at work.

This evening, after speaking to the complaining passenger, she retracted her allegation of assault and agreed to remove her Facebook post. In deference to local law enforcement and out of respect for both of our passengers, we cannot release the video at this time. However, if the complaining passenger agrees and law enforcement ok’s it, we will be happy to release the video in its entirety.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Wasn't my first time, but it was the girls. We'd been messing around for a few weeks, and we finally decided it was time. She started off giving me a BJ (She really had no idea what to do with a penis, didn't even know how to give a handjob the first time), and it eventually transitioned to ""do you have a condom?"" I hadn't really used condoms often in my previous relationship (stupid), so I fumbled one out of the wrapper. It was dark in the room, so I couldn't really determine which way to put it on. It finally felt like it was unrolling, and I pushed it down about half way. 

At that point, it was tough to get it down any further, but we decided it would roll the rest of the way on once I entered her. I finally work myself in. We're going for about 5 minutes and I begin thinking to myself ""I don't remember why I hated condoms this feels pretty good."" Then I noticed the wetness.. Oh shit.

I pulled my dick out and looked down. No more condom! She had pushed over the top of it, and the condom unrolled in the correct direction. Unfortunately, that direction was inside of her. 

We spent the next hour or so trying to get it out of her. First attempt was with my fingers. No dice. Then she began pacing (In only my button down shirt. It was pretty sexy.) Fail. Me being horny still, began using my fingers again which lead to using my fingers for other things. Turns out playing with her g-spot caused her to push it down within reach, and out it came!

TL;DR Condom came off inside the girl, and we spent an hour getting it out. 

Side story: Same girl. First blow job, I tell her ""I'm coming"", and she looks up and says ""What?"" Her hair was pretty mess after that. She thought that she had to suck the cum out like a straw. Poor girl.","1367367003"

I don't think this is good for you because..."") versus putting them down and expecting them to change (""God ScalpelBurn, why not just sleep with them like you always do?

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Rather than just repeating the line ""not true,"" can you please elaborate on your stance on the matter?

Music photographer is where I started and it still occupies a decent portion of my workload, among other things. Once my name started showing up on music videos for popular bands, promo shots, etc. I started getting a LOT of emails from aspiring concert photographers. I also see hundreds of concert photographers every year, working for free.

I know that most bands, until you reach the highest levels, don't have much cash to throw around, nor do the smaller labels. When determining where to cut costs, concert photography is often near the top of that list considering there is no shortage whatsoever of decent concert photographers willing to work for free.

The truth of the matter is that in most cases, it is very difficult to get away with charging very much money for concert photography, like kickstand said. ","1367367011"

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","**Image:**  
*Bedlam* - This series is 6 issues in, and it is easily one of my favorites right now. The main character is a reformed homicidal supervillain (like the Joker) that is now helping to solve crimes. 
   
*Saga* - Probably this subreddits favorite comic right now. A sci-fi and fantasy mixture about a family on the run from their two warring races—in space. It's 12 issues in, and is currently on hiatus for a few months.  
  
*The Manhattan Projects* - 11 issues in, A kind of alternate history by Hickman (writer of East of West) about the Manhattan project scientists. The atomic bomb was really just a front for their more questionable projects.  
  
**Dark Horse:**  
*Conan The Barbarian* -  It's a fun action/adventure comic with lots of sex and violence by Brian Wood. It's currently at #15 I believe.    
  
*Star Wars: Legacy* - It takes place 138 years after Episode IV, and follows the descendant of Han and Leia. It's only at issue #2 right now.

Let me point out some negatives that people are mentioning. 

""Has to go out for a cigarette, breaks up social things"" - Not really true in my opinion, smokers tend to be more sociable with a wider range of people as they go outside, rather than if you're in a club where you can never hear anyone.

""Always Coughing"" - This only applies to certain people, and depends heavily on how much they smoke, 3 packs a day will leave you hacking, a pack or so a week usually doesn't.

""Negative Habit"" from your perspective, I don't see my smoking as negative. No worse than drinking.","1367367012"

In my women's group, this one woman just decided out of the blue - that she couldn't 'connect' with me, because I was so 'fake' and 'pretended to be happy'.  It ended up with her being called out for trying to make me cry in front of the rest of the group, because she was blaming me for HER feeling bad in her relationship.  When I had nothing to do with her relationship! I might have seen her husband once for 15 seconds in over 10 years.  I still don't understand that one.

Best case scenario someone funds a project to document your population. Worse case scenario you get to go out, hang with an awesome species, collect data and practice a real scientific survey. Can't go wrong.

I should say if there was an interest in this species to document, it's likely that projects are already being funded.

"RandomActsofMakeup","t5_2vigj","Hey everyone! I'd like to start off by introducing myself. I'm a 24 year old (though my birthday is coming up soon!) college student living in the Greater Los Angeles area. I grew up the youngest of five in a house full of nothing but women save for my poor daddy (still don't know how he managed!), and I've had a love affair with makeup ever since I could remember.

I think was still in preschool when I started stealing the little tiny tubes of lipstick the Avon lady left with my mom, and started wearing makeup (without permission) at about 11 years old. My mom realized she couldn't stop me and I've been addicted ever since.

For me, makeup is just one of the ways I display my strength. My armor, if you will. I was obese all the way up through my teens, and makeup gave me the strength to face a world that normally looked down on me. It gave me a creative outlet, and it all around helped me feel confident, and it's a huge factor in how I managed to struggle through my disability and come out with a ""I take no one's crap"" attitude. I know for some people make up is just for fun, but for me... It's helped me get to where I am.

Your argument that Palestinians hide behind civilians is weak at best -- when Israeli gunships go and raze an entire city block to the ground based upon the weakest of evidence (uncorroborated tips from an ""informant"") that cannot be considered a justifiable use of force. Israel is propped up by American money and weaponry but is hated by much of the world (not because they dislike Jews) but because they dislike the unlawful occupation carried by the state of Israel. The recent vote for Palestinian recognition at the United Nations is a recent reminder of this.

The day that the American public sees through the veil that AIPAC spends millions of dollars on to hide the reality and realizes that Israel is more of a hassle than it is worth will be the day that Israel will finally have to honestly negotiate a two-state solution with the Palestinians.

It does have some utility though.

In this case, concise and dramatic can be good things. It helps to distill the biggest problems and promote the best solutions, all whilst reaching the most people. 

Polling, popular concerns and criticisms, as well as support/love are all things that shine through pretty well with this system.

Who operated the trains that took these Jews to their final destination? Who tallied the records to see who was or was not a Jew? Who made the bullets for the SS using slave labor? 

Do you believe these people were not German? they only arrested those who where in the power position, but most Germans through ignoring the suffering of their fellow human beings were part of what the Nazi party did.

Who can a nation of about 50  to 60 million people be victims to a few hundred thousand? The German people were complacent, they didn't care when Jewish business were outlawed, they didn't care when Jews were concentrated in ghettos and they didn't care when they started putting them in ovens.

Not all Germans carried pistols and Zyklon-B cans, but they didn't protect or speak up for those who were being murdered.

There were people who were silenced in Germany, there were those who fought against the regime, they were those that noticed the atrocities and tried to do something, but they were not the majority, and not even enough to slow down or stop what the nazi party did.

It's easy to say 'the nazis were evil, the germans good' but that is whitewashing history and frankly, an insult, to those who died in German hands in the Third Reich.","1367367027"

i guess i find the pouting idealism and self-congratulations in this blog awkward when contrasted with the professionals just going about their business and reporting what news they find. an investigation has been opened on a national athlete. if the story develops into something in the next few days i would rather Hillary Lake keep doing what she's doing at KATU without getting harangued by the peanut gallery.

They now have 600,000 dollars that went to a for profit company, not Mars One (when the money was given on the application, there was print saying you weren't actually giving it to the non profit Mars One, but an affiliated for profit). They will then take that money and run a reality TV show consisting of training the participants. Eventually, money will start coming in from ads. After a few seasons, the show ends and everyone walks away and the ""astronauts"" are returned to their lives saying the plan failed. Meanwhile, the people associated with the project have been paying themselves 6 figure salaries the entire time and are millionaires by the time it ends. The money has been successfully laundered as their salary and they walk away clean.
I will be very surprised if they give more than a few thousand dollars in contract money to SpaceX or any legitimate space research group along the way. Just enough to satisfy the more moderate naysayers to make it look like they aren't a scam. SpaceX plays ball as it is free advertisement. Their name will be plastered all over the reality show of the people in training and everyone will get the impression that SpaceX is the biggest, baddest, and only (in their minds) space exploration company in existence.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Wow, you are really working the promiscuous, casual sex is great theme, aren't you?

My first thought is...trying to make yourself feel better about it?

I'm sure there are people who can handle it and who do it for the sheer physical pleasure they get from it.  That's fine.  If that's you, I'm happy for you and have no judgement call to make.

However, most people - especially girls - just aren't built that way.  The vast majority of sexually promiscuous girls (and women) are that way because they have little to no self respect and are trying to find acceptance or some other elusive emotion or connection that is missing in their lives.  

I've seen it over and over in my high school, college and now with my kids' friends.  The kids you know who are ""doing"" multiple partners at young ages are the kids from broken or dysfunctional homes.  I'm not talking about girls who have a few partners (although they sometimes qualify as well), but the girls like one in my daughter's sophomore class who's had 10 or 11 partners this year alone.  She isn't looking for physical fun, she's looking for attention...and bad attention is better than no attention.

And it's not a matter (to me anyway) of slut-shaming.  I don't think it's a matter for shame, but as always_an_asshole said, I just feel bad about the lack of self respect.  It's one thing to have equal partners who have an enjoyable time, but being the school ""slut"" where the girl is only seen as a toy for the boys to play with and practice on, isn't a healthy situation for anyone.","1367367039"
"Piracy","t5_2qmox","Upvoting because this is the very problem I run into in the piracy debate. It is my opinion that the market should decide what are acceptable profits for a company.

This isn't a reason to pirate, it's just an unfortunate fact. 

Copyright causes way too many problems. But instead of fixing that, people would rather blame piracy. ","1367367039"

"Tgirls","t5_2rxrh","They are, you're right.  It's not really ideal, but it's basically the happiest medium we came to.  We've worked with a lot of transfolk, especially with people from /r/asktransgender, and basically the consensus we came to is that we keep the subreddit itself clean, but the link content we don't exert much control over.  You can't use tranny, shemale, or trap in the subreddit, and ladyboy can only be used if the girl is Asian.  ""Shemale"" is very offensive; one of the worst pejoratives you can use, but if we cut out every single porn site that used that or ""tranny"", we wouldn't really have much left.  I mean shemaletube and ShemaleYum are two of the biggest out there.  So basically after a long debate amongst mods, various transwomen we knew, and a reddit thread I've long since lost, we decided that if you're in our house (the subreddit), you follow the rules, but outside of the house (the links) it's fair game and we don't control it.   

Thing is, a while back this subreddit was kind of a wasteland of bigotry, objectification, and disgusting nomenclature.  So we had to put down SOME set of rules.  And we enforce them, even if they're not perfect.  Same with the image hosting; we did that to cut down on TONS of blogspam.  So we set the rules and we enforce them, even if you link to an image site that's harmless, we still stick to our rules.  If we start making exceptions for a few people, we may as well throw the rules out the window.","1367367041"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","No duh, I never said population. I said rural vs city and that there are very very few states that dont have large red areas that are rural. Even up there in NY state there are red counties. Its CLEARLY not just the south.

The trend:

high population -&gt; blue!

low population -&gt; red! 

Southerners get pointed out because people don't like their accents and don't understand their generally open and loud culture.

Also are you seriously implying that the only people voting blue in the south are black people? You never stopped to think that maybe its the presence of diversity (aka having black people around at all) that makes an area more progressive? Thats why cities are more accepting, because they are actually EXPOSED to other cultures and see more than just whats on TV (which happens to be black people portrayed doing crimes and acting violent, statistically. This is the real problem.). With no comparison in real life, HOW can they progress? 

I know back in my highschool, there were 10 black students and 22 hispanic students in my school of 750 students. Zero, and I mean zero, people of any other race. And most of the black students were actually mixed with white and barely count. The hispanic people barely even knew how to speak spainish anymore. My town of 10,000 people was 94% white and that 6% comes from the hispanic families. I never met or even saw an Indian or Middle Eastern person until I was atleast 15 years old, and I was scared the first time, to be honest. Id never seen one in real life and literally the only things on TV are like ""TERRORISTS AND EXTREMELY RELIGIOUS"". What else am I supposed to believe? In movies they just kidnap people. I know ""DURR YOU BELIEVE EVERYTING IN MOVIES?"" but just think about it for a minute. What if your ONLY exposure to another culture was from the TV and news? You cant just magically become tolerant when the NATIONAL NEWS SERVICES all are constantly acting biased about certain races. As far as homophobia honestly thats getting much much rarer in the south and only older people care. In a few years they will all be dead and it wont matter. Know why? People come out of the closet more, and people can be exposed to it and realize that the news is lying.","1367367042"

That's not accurate. Every weapon has a maximum mechanical rate of fire even if a person could pull the trigger infinitely quickly. 

As a matter of practicality, a statute could simply presume a set rate of fire for semi-automatic weapons. The statute could then factor in the typical amount of time it takes to reload the weapon and the size of the weapon's clip to calculate an effective rate of fire.

Your share example is incorrect.  Most shareholders aren't traders so losses go on capital account, 

Other losses that are incurred are tested to see whether they are commercial before they are put against ordinary income.  

As property is always deemed investment - the deductions are allowed.

The reason some believe it is cheating the system is because of the tax deduction associated - ordinarily it makes borrowing ""cheaper"" in terms of annual cash flow.

If the overspill is larger than the empty space then sizing up could make the shape workable enough, but if it is about equal or even less then the improved accessibility to the lower volume in a larger cup size will overcompensate for the spillage and gape.

That being said, I would highly suggest you read a book by Ann Lawson called Understanding the Borderline Mother. It talks about everything, from different types of personalities associated with BPD (Hermit, Witch, Waif, Queen), what their husbands are usually like, and what kids or people that have any kind of relationship with a BPD person can do to help themselves. It was so helpful to me. Just the fact that someone, somewhere, somehow understood what was going on was a big relief in itself. 

It's funny, I found out my mom has undiagnosed BPD through my therapist too. But my mother has WAY too much pride to acknowledge she's anything less than perfect.

Not only do the sperm have to be healthy, enough of them have to reach the egg.  I read somewhere that the average, um, deposit contains millions of sperm, but only a couple hundred will reach the egg.
Also, your cervical fluid needs to be of suitable quality and volume to help the sperm get where they need to be.  Normal things like stress, hormones, even types of lube can make your cervix inhospitable to sperm.
Hope this helps!","1367367051"

Yeah I watched the first episode of that when it went up on Crunchyroll (legal anime streaming site). It's being directed by the same director of the Death Note anime adaptation. It looks really promising and the trailer I saw for it made it look insane. I think I unfortunately got spoiled to some of the lore behind the giants, but I'm definitely still going to watch it.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","I have been ""THE WORLDS GREATEST UNCLE IN THE WORLD OF ALL TIME"" since my nephew was born- kicked it up a notch for his sister- keepin going even though I am a dad now. 

Last Christmas The boy was discovering the awesomeness of ""JET FIGHTERS!"" and did not even know yet what a Transformer was- so he got a vintage Starscream (I never got to have Transformers) for Christmas along with The Complete Book of Fighters:An Illustrated Encyclopedia Of Every Fighter Aircraft Built And Flown.  I got to finally enjoy the awesomeness of a Transformer and learn about some sweet fighter aircraft while spending awesome quality time with the Bephew (best nephew- I am Buncle). I now get phone calls often about various Transformers and have serious discussions on the merits of the F4u vs P51....

For his sister I bought some books on how to draw Unicorns, Dragons, Fairies and all of the mythical stuff she is into. I told her that her first attempt at a unicorn sucked and proceeded to draw a better one myself.   From then on I am alerted to all of her finished works, with captions like ""Better than you""  ""bet you can't draw this one"" ""nuh uh you suck"" 

For me- The key to keeping them close is to find the legit common ground and regress back into the kid you used to be. Tag is still pretty fun even though my knees are hanging from threads. Couch forts rule, Couch-fort-farters suck, I am often the latter.  I never let them win. If they want to win they better bring their ""A-Game"".

Afterwards, I either pull up if I'm low hp to take him with me or I dodge to the side now.

You can't check for claymores because they blend in so well, they're so tiny, and there's no easy way to disarm them. Paths are extremely predictable and you don't even need to hide it behind the door you can drop it on a staircase and no one will see it. The only other option is to check every step before you go anywhere and in a game so fast paced it's better to just pray there isn't one than to actually take time to check for them. What do you do if you find one? There's no way to disarm it you have to try and set it off before someone who didn't see it runs in and gets killed. Claymores have the same problem c4 has in that it's very effective to just suicide run into people, drop one and get free kills. I hate to have to reference extra credits again because this video has been discussed to death already, but we have to remember that items and abilities need fun counter play. Fighting claymores isn't fun. Getting killed by them isn't fun. I know I'm going to die if a tank is chasing me or if someone runs in with a shotgun but with claymores you may as well have randomly shut off the game or forced redeploy.","1367367060"

And, most irritatingly to me(At least more so recently) is that people are gutting the substance of Doctor Who in exchange for 'answers'. We've had some great episodes this season, The Doctor has developed, the characters have developed, and yet everyone keeps shouting how bad of a writer Moffat is because 'We still don't know why the TARDIS exploded' or 'The Silence haven't been mentioned this season'.

For me, personally, it's just getting old. I come here to discuss Doctor Who, but more and more it's just people attacking the show because it's not doing what they want it to do. Whether it's 'I want more answers' or 'I want a heavier overall story arch' or 'I want a weaker overall story arch' or 'I want more internal logical consistency'. Then, whatever they don't like, they attack it and say that the entirety of the writing for the show is crap because they didn't like how it was presented.

And...I don't know, maybe I'm just ranting at this point. I just feel frustrated. It feels like this is the millionth time Jimmy has made a post to specifically say 'We haven't learned about the TARDIS exploding, WTF!?', and between that and people ignoring how good of an episode Journey to the Center of the TARDIS was, all we hear is,""This is bad writing, because the TARDIS doesn't translate Gallifrayan!!"" I don't know, it's all getting old to me. For once I'd like a damn internet community where I can actually discuss some story that I like without the discussion being overwhelmed by people bitching because the writer(s) didn't write it in some magical way that would make them happy. For every show, movie, book, etc. that I like, this always ends up happening. I just want to slap everyone and shout 'This isn't discussion, this is flat out cynicism, and I wish you would take it elsewhere!'

"socialskills","t5_2r275","lazerwolf852 had an awesome reply. I +1 everything he says, and I'm going to start using his phrase ""trying to save face is making you lose face"".

&gt; What steps did you take to completely stop caring about what people thought of you? 

It is really hard to lay out a set of steps, on how do you change your emotions. You need to be honest here, and realize that's exactly what we are talking about: *emotions*. Logically it makes sense to not care, but for some reason you can't stop thinking a certain way. What do we call that kind of thinking? Emotions. They can be your best friend and guide when used properly, but they can be your worst enemy when you don't know how to control them.

The most important emotion you are experiencing here is likely to be *fear*. You are *afraid* of what might happen if you try to socialize, and fail. What you need to do is develop a positive emotion that outweighs your negative one. The fear will never fully go away, but you will be able to function despite it (which is the definition of courage, btw). So try to imagine what you want to get out of socializing, and how that will improve your life. How would it make you *feel* to be sociable, to make new friends, etc? For one thing, it would make you feel powerful, because you are controlling your own world. Now realize that by giving in to fear, you are giving up all those things you want.

A relevant book is titled ""Emotional Intelligence."" Not sure it will help you control your emotions, but you need to start being a lot more introspective about them.","1367367065"

It spends money and then taxes it back out of the economy. It cannot run out of money as it prints it at will. And the debt is a reflection of the nongovernmental sectors savings.

The statement is controversial because you cannot define how much is too much and we are to assume that debt is just bad. It is in fact necessary as it is the currency itself. You cannot have dollars unless the government creates debt, because that's where it comes from.","1367367067"

Is the majority of the crowd standing around? Yes? Alright lets give them something a bit more catchy or upbeat, they need something to get them a bit more energized and pumped. This is where a more popular song may come in handy. Been playing back to back bangers or hard kickers? The crowd may look like they are starting to get tired so slow it down a bit. This could be a good time to play that feel good song you have stored up in your playlist. If you are having a tough time telling maybe you should acknowledge the crowd, such as ""How we doing tonight!"" though I would not necessarily suggest this after only 3 or 4 songs into your mix.

White people are sometimes featured and/or nominated for BET awards, but they usually don't win. I want to say Eminem got snubbed a few times. But again, BET is something of a joke at this point.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Let me tell you a little story about RAID 0.

I like you wanted to slap a few HDDs in RAID, thinking that the performance increase would make a difference, so i bought 3 samsung 500GB HDD and put them into Raid 0 on a EVGA 780i MOBO. 

***WORST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE***

at first everything went without a hitch, i installed everything correctly and had it up and running and everything was fine and dandy. Then abour 2 months in the comp freezes and gives me a slowmo robot voice of what ever sound was playing. So unraided the drives, tested them, and reinstalled windows....Nope that didnt work....sent in the mobo.....Nope that didnt fix it....Took em out of RAID and sold the comp and bought a new one and booting on a single SSD with a media drive....Been running strong without a problem for almost 2 years. 

The moral of the story here is, RAID when using HDDs you will not see a awesome increase in speed. Take it from me i had 3 in RAID 0, and it increased my boot speed by about...10 seconds....NOT WORTH IT. After thinking about it i came to the conclusion it was the RAID controller on the MOBO. 

If speed of hard drives is your purpose....Buy a SSD, they tried 8 HDD in raid 0 agaisnt a single SSD....The ssd won.

TLDR: Just buy a SSD to boot off / performace, use your HDDs for storage purposes and dont RAID them...please, unless you want to drop an extra 400-600 bucks on a internal RAID controller.....just buy a god damn SSD.","1367367078"

Whether or not the laws are there to make it harder, they *do* make it harder.

I ended up stuck on Timing or Force.  Up until then I was very pleased with the game.

Once I had what I needed to access the area, I realized I couldn't actually return.

It's things like this that make for good Metroid games; teasing the player with areas they can't reach and locking the player into an area (Without just cheaping out with a locked door) so that they don't get as confused.

4 minutes ago


&gt;We take every customer complaint seriously, and respond as quickly as possible. We are currently cooperating with local law enforcement and media outlets.

&gt;We take extraordinary measures to ensure the safety and comfort of our customers. We are the first and only cab company in Richmond that utilizes closed-circuit cameras in every vehicle, including the vehicle in which the alleged assault occurred.

&gt;As soon as we became aware of this complaint, we reviewed the pertinent video. The video does not show the alleged assault. It does show that the cab driver picked up two passengers in violation of local law and company policy. As a result, his relationship with Napoleon Taxi has been terminated effective immediately.

&gt;The video also shows both passengers conversing amicably, discussing among other things where they work. The passenger who issued the complaint invited the second passenger to visit her at work.

&gt;This evening, after speaking to the complaining passenger, she retracted her allegation of assault and agreed to remove her Facebook post. In deference to local law enforcement and out of respect for both of our passengers, we cannot release the video at this time. However, if the complaining passenger agrees and law enforcement ok’s it, we will be happy to release the video in its entirety.

&gt;Jonathan S. Trainum and Christopher Brevard, Co-owners of Napoleon Taxi

Yes, when saying he'd be axing two-parters he discussed cost and the AI, but he made it abundantly clear that the main goal was ""I want to be able to say, every week, we've got a big standalone blockbuster, and then a trailer that makes it look like nothing compared to what's going to happen next week!"".

I agree with you that serialization is important, which is why I'm so disconcerted with this lack of thematic continuity. 

I don't feel like Series Five led into Series Six and I certainly don't feel like Series Six led into Series Seven A (and I don't even feel that, outside of perhaps *Asylum of the Daleks* that Series Seven A led into Series Seven B).

One's the cracks season. Then the Silence Season. Then the Ponds leaving half-season. Then the Clara Mystery half-season. They don't feel thematically connected. It's very start-stop-start. 

I agree with you that a serialization brings a sense of urgency, but when the main threat or mystery is constantly changing every few episodes it gets genuinely difficult to keep caring.","1367367085"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I remember sitting in a Keno Bar in a casino in Reno (I want to say Harrahs but it was a few years ago).  It was about 11 at night, I was just relaxing and partaking in free drinks.  This was on a weekday so I was literally the only person sitting there.

About 50 or so feet away from the back of the Keno Bar was a Pai Gow table.  It was the only table with people at it in the entire casino, being that late at night, so the dealer and who I assumed was the pit boss were both near the table, the dealer doing her thing and the pit boss just standing back but keeping an eye on things.

When I got there it was mostly cheering, because I'm guessing they were winning.  But it soon turned the other way.  The next thing I know there are two security guards standing in the keno lounge.  Far enough away that the people at the table can't see them, but close enough to move in if something happened.

It didn't take long.  One of the guys lost and literally threw the cards or tiles or whatever they use for the game right at the dealer.  They hit her in the face, and he jumped up and started yelling something that wasn't in english (I'm guessing it was Japanese) at the dealer, shaking his fist, etc.  The other 5 people at the table backed away, and the two security guards grabbed him and started dragging him out, the Pit Boss following.  I'm guessing he was thrown out.

After that, everyone sat down again, and besides cheers and grumbles in normal tones, the game went on normally I'm guessing.

I finished my drink and called it a night and decided to check my keno tickets in the morning at that point.","1367367086"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","&gt;There's a reason why punctuation took so long to develop: you can get along fine without it.

If you think that translating a document written in a classic language which doesn't even consider spaces between words is easy, I suggest you try it.

&gt;It may be translated any way you like, but that doesn't make the translation correct.

A word by word translation of this Leviticus 18:22

ואת זכר לא תשכב משכבי אשה תועבה הִוא 
 
V’et-zachar lo tishkav mishk’vei ishah to’evah hu.
 
(Transliterated using modern Israeli Sephardic pronunciation.)

Correct translation:

And with a male, thou shalt not lie down in a woman's bed; it is an abomination.

""Abomination"" in this context means 'against tradition'. This passage is preceded by the prohibition of the idolatrous sexuality of worshiping Molech, whose cult included male cult prostitutes and bestiality. This law is made to separate Jews from pagans and basically states that 'because pagans have sex with male prostitutes, Jews shouldn't'.

&gt;All these translations are the work of dozens of Christian, Jewish, and secular scholars. To say they got it wrong where there's virtual unanimity is pretty unreasonable.

They may have not got it wrong by accident. They may never have seen the original texts. More likely, they reflected contemporary society through the translation of the passage. The NASB and the Amplified Bible were published during the mid-60s/early 70s - a period or great polarisation over the subject of homosexuality - and the NRSV was published during the AIDs epidemic. I would bet that these translations reflect the political atmosphere and public attitude towards gays.

&gt;There's nothing sexual about any of these.

""Ruth 1:14 states:

At this they wept aloud again. Then Orpah kissed her 
mother-in-law good-bye, but Ruth clung to her.

The word translated as clung in Ruth 1:14 is the Hebrew word ""dabaq"". 

This word is also translated in Genesis 2:24 as united ""to his wife"" and in Genesis 34:3 as drawn ""to Dinah daughter of Jacob; he loved the young woman"". The context of these passages is one of romantic or sexual attraction.""

&gt;And in the OT God punishes homosexuality even in nations besides Israel anyway.

Elaborate on this please.

&gt;If it's not talking specifically about homosexuality there are still others that are.

My main point in the piece was to show that homosexuality is not portrayed as negatively in the Bible as some people claim it is. I do not doubt that the Bible shows no support for gays, however it does not demonise them to the extent that  many modern Christians believe it does.

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","I may be able to help you. I suffered a major ankle injury (tore 95% one ligament and 35% the other), and had a surgery to repair them. I was off my feet for quite some time. I also suffered a dual shoulder labrum tear, which put me out of activity at least a year, but that's when I gained the weight in the first place.

First of all, you'd be surprised how much the body kicks itself into gear when you're healing from injury. I lost weight when I had the ankle injury, and all I did was eat, sit on the couch, and sleep. Not saying that's what you should do, but remember you need to let your body heal properly or else you risk reinjury (which I will tell you from experience is almost worse). Keep a very close eye on your diet so you don't overeat. That will be key during this healing time.

Once you're back on your feet, don't jump right into your usual routine. Your muscles will experience some level of atrophy (which is both comical and frustrating), and you'll need to regain basic strength again. My left calf shrunk to the size of my arm, and it took a lot of hard work to get it to where walking felt normal again. Ease into it. If you're able, look into a brief stint of physical therapy to get to where you need to be.

After you're all healed up, and your muscles are normal, start over. You'll have lost a lot of muscle over this time, and that's going to suck., But don't worry! You can get back on the horse and keep going.

In the meantime, look for exercises you can do without using your legs. Find some exercises for sitting or laying down, so you can still do something. You can also get around on the crutches if you feel up to it, which will keep you moving. Do you have access to an arm bike? It isn't much, but it's something.

Remember to take care of yourself and don't rush into it. Best wishes!!!","1367367097"

Don't despair, it's probably something simple, read on to find out how to fix this sad state of affairs.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] comments
* Example: Alabama Shakes - Hold On [indie rock, soul]

I'm only a simple computer program so if you deviate from that title format chances are I won't be able to recognize it, and I'll end up blocking it again. If you didn't use that format, delete your submission (by clicking delete up above) and submit it again with the proper title.

If you used the right format and it still got blocked, then we have a problem with the genre tags.

There is one genre tag I won't see. That tag is **indie** - for the [reasons listed here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/ksaua/can_we_all_agree_that_indie_in_and_of_itself_is/)

You must give me more than just [indie] in your genre tags.

If you're having trouble figuring out what genre to use, a quick search on [google](http://www.google.com), [last.fm](http://www.last.fm), [wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org), or a trip to the band's website will easily help you find out. Down below after the line is a list of genre tags that I do recognize (and I can do partial matches, for example *rock* matches *rockabilly* and *post-rock*). Use *any* of these and everything will be fine. If you can think of a tag I missed, message the mods and they'll get it added to this list.

First of all, the smoke which smokers inhale that is proven to cause cancer is the same fucking smoke you inhale with second hand smoking. What? Are you magically immune to it?

Second of all, of course acute exposure to second hand smoking won't give you cancer. It needs to be chronic, something which it WAS before the ban. You couldn't go to a public place without having to deal with it.

Third of all, for fuck's sake, of course no research has proven it. What the fuck do you expect the research to be? Blow smoke into people's faces for 50 years and see if they die of cancer?

It's fucking research nightmare to setup a control and quantify exposure to second hand smoking. That's why there aren't any definitive studies made on it.

* long tempos range from 3 miles at 6:25 pace to 6 miles at 6:40 pace roughly

* cruise intervals - 5-6 x 1 mile at 6:25 pace with about 75-90 seconds rest between each

Times are ballpark guesses, adjust them as you feel. A tempo should not feel intense like a race - don't worry about hitting the times, if you are straining hard to hit them you're probably doing too much.

Do some other hill repeats, speedwork, long runs, whatever else too but the strength tempos will be the biggest benefit for you. A good goal for you is under 6 minute pace (18:3x) but on a fast course and some improvement 18:00-18:15 is not unreasonable. Good luck!","1367367107"

Temperature is constant specifically because the internal energy is given by the simple relation U = 3/2 N * k * T, where N is the number of particles and k is Boltzmann's constant, and both internal energy and the number of particles remain constant. Further, the gas is not doing work, since it is expanding into a vacuum. The proper expression to use is dF = -SdT -PdV + µdN, where µ is the chemical potential and N is the number of particles. The last term in the differential goes to zero if there are no leaks. With that, it is only necessary to integrate pressure as a function of volume, a task which requires a simple application of the Ideal Gas Law. ","1367367107"

As of current, more than 70,000 people are dead due to the ongoing war against drugs. More than 100 journalists have been murdered or kidnapped while trying to say the truth. [Bloggers who have been doing nothing but to warn their people to keep them out of harm have been kidnapped and decapitated as a way to deter people from using the Social Medias as an aid](http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=442210&amp;CategoryId=14091).     

It is understandable that the [War on Terror]™© is very important and there are reasons to be so, but you cannot simply ignore how just next to you there is a country bleeding slowly to death. A bit of tending and nurture - not infiltration - can do a great change.

I purposely didnt do crossfit for 2 days prior to the tournament, i treated the match as if it was a normal day where i do crossfit first, and jiu jitsu after, except there wasnt any crossfit, and i had tons of energy to play with.

I'm not talking about a miracle cure, but finding something to hold on to is important (not talking about family or friends) but something that deeply makes you happy and/or forget why you might be depressed for in the first place.

It could be anything, most people suggest going to the gym or any form of physical activities because it releases stuff that makes you feel good about youself. But something as simple as going outdoor to read is the reaosn I'm still here writting to you. Go up to the library, ask anyone who's working there for any good book that are easy to fall into, and find yourself a spot behind a tree to read.

1. If you are running a build on your computer (or anything that taxes the computer) and someone calls, there is a good chance the call will cut out.
1. If you call ""helpdesk"" and need to restart your computer you must get a callback, since the call will cut out when it restarts.
1. There is a noticeable lag in audio...we have meetings in our area w/customers from our respective cubes, and it gets distracting when I can hear a coworker say something and it takes 1/2 a second to reach my headset...when this goes on for an hour long meeting, it starts to grate on you.","1367367119"

The interview turned into a giant group meeting where they played this video that was more of a sales pitch as to why I should take the job instead of me convincing them I should be hired. They kept saying things like ""unlimited potential for wealth"" and ""make unlimited money!"" 

I walked into the room for the actual ""interview"" and the guy told me he liked my suit and within 30 seconds ""knew"" I was the right candidate and wanted to hire me on the spot. Didn't even look at me resume or talk to me about my experience or ability. He just ""knew"" because he could read people or some shit.

I was polite, told him I had to think about it, went home and never went back. I did some more research on the company using some of the materials they provided and realized that it was a legal form of a pyramid scheme.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","&gt; I don't understand how Jews who believe in Jesus can continue to call themselves Jews - they are no longer Jews. The Torah explicitly states that...

First of all, Jesus *was* a flesh-and-blood human, according to Christianity.  He was also God.  And God was him, but somehow they're still separate, and there's also a third thing that's God, but God is one.  And three.  It's awfully confusing and all completely contradictory, but hey, welcome to Christianity.  Logic gives up.

But the more substantive point here is the reason why I cut off your statement where I did -- is there anything that a Jew is required to believe in to call himself a Jew?  The Rambam would say so, obviously, but this is not at all true today.  There are many Jews who are atheists (like myself)!  I've even known some rather observant and believing Jews who refuse to sing parts of Yigdal -- metim y'chayeh El b'rov chasdo?  They do not think so.  The Reconstructionists even replace the end of G'vurot in the Amidah with ""m'chayeh hakol"" instead of ""m'chayeh hametim"".  There are clearly points of contention in belief.  One could say that belief in God and the supremacy of the Torah are required, but nowadays people have all sorts of different beliefs on the subject.  The truth is that if you decide on some restrictive classification, you're going to knock *some* people out.  The ""who is a Jew"" question is difficult.  I think the line has to be drawn somewhere, but I think you'll find a lot of people you consider Jews on the wrong side of the line you're currently drawing.

I do agree with you, though, that worship Jesus should disqualify you from being called Jewish.","1367367119"

1) the VS launcher has the potential to be abused as an anti-aircraft weapon due to the instant travel time, If there was a sever rotational penalty on the turret when firing and initial hit damage was minimal so damaging aircraft was neigh impossible then I would be fine with it, otherwise I cannot say this game needs anymore AA options, even accidental AA options.

2) I can see people complain about the mortar now ""WHY DOES NC GET ARTILLERY"" ""MORTAR OP PLZ NERF THX."" ""WTF! I CANT HIT ANYTHING WITH THIS DAMN THING, WHY DOES THE NC GET SCREWED EVERY UPDATE!"" stuff like that. If you give one faction some from of artillery you had better give the others something similar or EVERYONE will bitch.

Besides those concerns and assuming the mortar was kept in I think the TR and NC turrets should be switched. Tr have the faction identity of high ROF and NC have the whole alpha strike thing so i think that the mortar would go good with the TR and the railgun great with the NC. Besides there was that railgun Vanny pulled from the game files a while back so it looks like if railguns ever are implemented they would be an NC thing. Also i think a mortar would fit TR better because TR are going for the traditional military and nothing says military like a mortar.

Pharmacies, because we pump so much medicine into the diet of these animals they can literally be killed-&gt;cut open -&gt; dropped into a puddle of their own blood and excrement and still be considered edible. Stop and think about how much of an antibiotic you would need to pull something like that off. Now multiply that by every cow you see slaughtered. Anti-biotic sellers will NEVER willingly see their profits drop by losing out on this proverbial cash cow. And as corporations run america (ag-gag being the most blatant and offensive example of this) nothing will change that. ","1367367124"

No dress looks good on every body type... you know they will wear whatever you say if you demand it, but probably feel awful in it if it doesn't suit them.  You want them to have a nice time, don't you?  And want them to look good in pictures?

For reference, apple shape looks good in something that hits under the bust, scoop or v-neckline, showing off arms or legs or both depending on which they prefer, and an A-line flared skirt that hits right around the knee.  All one color, no detail on the waist, in a flowy fabric like chiffon.

"Judaism","t5_2qi67","&gt;Why am I not considered a Jew by the Orthodox but the Reform Jews generally accept me? Why does my mother's blood matter so much especially when I was not even raised by her? 

Because that is Orthodox Jewish law (which imo, IS Jewish law). If your mother is Jewish or you are a convert, you are Jewish. Nothing else matters. Likewise, if you had a Jewish mother in this scenario and were raised by Catholics, you would be 100% Jewish.

&gt;As an adult, I don't see why it is necessary for me to go through some big conversion process and become extremely observant in order to be accepted as an actual member of my own community that I grew up in when those other kids can do whatever they want and no matter what, they're still 100% Jewish.

You can identify however you want. Does not mean I have to accept it. Judaism is more than a religion, it is a nationality. In America, all you need is one American parent. Why? Because that is American law. If American law said you needed something else and you did not have it, you cannot just walk into America and demand your citizenship. You need to do that something else. So to, Judaism has something else that you do not have. You can convert, and perhaps you should. But do not force me to accept your self identification, and I will not ever prohibit you from self identifying.","1367367127"

He also mentioned that the 360 had a panel behind the seats that would allow access to the front of the engine to change belts, and maybe timing. The 355 didn't and had to have the engine dropped every time.

Its a fantastic idea, but unless you can afford the huge maintenance and potential for the car to break down someplace thats nowhere near a Ferrari mechanic, buying locally might be a better idea. Ferrari's really need to be worked on by Ferrari mechanics from what I hear/read.

It also pulled to the left when accelerating hard which kind of freaked me out.  The final blow is that my wife felt uncomfortable in the passenger seat of the SX.  She was much more comfortable in the Mazda.  Also, after going back and forth between Mazda and Kia the Optima started giving me a cheap vibe.  The Optima is a beautiful car but inside started feeling to cluttered and overdone while the Mazda 6 felt just more simple, classy and just right.  I've had the 6 a few days now and it's great.

No libertarian theorist worth his or her salt is using deontological ""natural rights"" or consequentialist justifications nowadays.

The attempt at ""justifying a value position"" and hoping for any sort of truth at all is totally misguided.

People here may or may not be familiar with Wittgenstein's philosophy, but if you get one thing out of it, it could be a sort of maxim to pay really close attention to what we really mean when we say or do certain things. I think people are talking about ""justifying"" in multiple ways. One famous line of his is:

I think it started with DeMuslim trolling him on ladder. He promised to 2-rax Idra on ladder if he reached 10.000 viewers or so. It was also some talk on him sniping him specifically (not sure if that happened), but knowing Idra, that would piss him off. He not only hates 2Raxes, it affects his stream and practice as well. So Idra blocked him on B.net and started to leave the game if they met each other on ladder.

And as the community/viewers pick up on this, they started asking a lot of questions about Demuslim in Idra's stream chat. He then asked mods to ban everyone mentioning Ben, so he obviously doesn't care to discuss the subject publicly.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I have been having what I am considering paranormal experiences my whole life. It all started after my father, sister and I moved into the apartment above my grandparents. It was an old Victorian Era farmhouse that that been bought by my great-grandparents in the 40's. At some point in time it had been split into two dwellings. My great-grandmother had recently passed away (and my great-grandfather several years before) so when we moved in all of her things were still there. On our first night in the building I woke up early in the morning to the sound of boxes being moved around in the building. As I was laying in bed listening, my grandfather (who lived downstairs and woke up early for work) came up. Seeing me lying in bed he asked why we were making so much noise so early, so I told him I thought dad was moving boxes to get to the bathroom. He walked past me and into the kitchen, then turned and left. As he left I realized that we could hear my dad snoring from his bedroom... sound asleep. 

After that things happened all the time. I would hear people walking up and down the stairs when my sister and I were the only ones home, I would see shadow people all over the apartment, and one day a voice came on the intercom system asking for a turkey Italian while we were discussing dinner options. I ran downstairs thinking my grandfather was trying to be funny, but there was nobody home.

Since then I've had paranormal experiences in my new home (after my grandmother died) and at a ridiculously haunted building when I went to college (There are too many to type here). I also recently experienced something after the loss of a close friend. I feel that I am particularly sensitive to the paranormal, but by no means a medium. If you guys want to get more details/hear more stories let me know.

If bluetooth audio is the selected output, Netflix will load and display about a second's worth of video and then simply freeze - with no way of restarting it. I've tried multiple browsers, and reinstalling Silverlight, and also trying videos displayed using silverlight from other sources (mainly the Microsoft website for testing if silverlight works) and they all have the same issue. However, as soon as I switch the audio out from bluetooth to the internal speakers it works as expected again. 

Through googling it seems this is a fairly common problem, and I couldn't really find any solution, so if anyone has any suggestions it would be greatly appreciated!

Now add onto that the fact that we already devote 1/3 of our working hours towards taxes and it's just another punch in the nuts. The ""solution"" is to raise taxes to pay for the ""small debt"". Now we are paying more and forever it will be, as you may be aware when new taxes are introduced they are never retracted (apart from a VERY small number over the years, which they just make new ones to take their place anyway.

If you were to run a household in this manner you wouldn't last long. You would be foreclosed on in a very fast manner and literally be thrown out onto the street. I expect from the people managing the Australian ""household"" to be able to manage the bottom line just as the average person is expected to. The fact is that the governmant now is absolutey shit house at doing this and it pisses me off!

And country in debt is not necessarily moving forward, look at who is at the top of economic growth (in regards to countries) and you can draw a paralell. The ones at the top are not in debt, in fact they provide the credit for the countries that are in debt.

Of *course* you get shot in the back there.  100% of the time.   Even if you cleared the area (which he didn't) you still get shot in the back there from the predictable respawns.

"BabyBumps","t5_2s7cl","I don't have much in the way of advice, but on the validation end of things... I felt exactly the same way at about 7 weeks.  Like, my job wasn't stressful, and I didn't have anything to do after work except veg out on the couch (thanks to my super awesome husband helping me out), and I was WIPED OUT.  I would sleep 10+ hours a night, and then every day about 2pm, I would almost fall asleep at my desk.  Like, not a little ""Oh, I'm dragging a bit, maybe I need to get up and walk around for a minute to lift this little fog.""  More like how in cartoons, characters put toothpicks in their eyes to physically keep them from closing.  I would just sit and stare at my computer for half an hour because my brain was pretty much non-functional for a bit.

For me, it got better (as did the constant queasiness that I also had) at around 13-14 weeks.

So, if you think you can survive, then maybe just push through it.  But, there's no harm in saying ""I can't do it all.""  You aren't superwoman, and that's ok.

(And, FWIW, I think the ladies who ""do it all"" can do so because they really aren't doing it all... they have a LOT of help.  I'm not dissing them, I'm just saying that nobody can do it all alone.  I mean, do you think Hillary Clinton cleans her toilets?  I doubt it.)","1367367140"

In that case, it is Cristiano who has the obligation to score not the 9s because this team goes to Cristiano each time. He shoots more than Higuain, Benzema, Di Maria, Callejon, Ozil, Xabi and Khedira combined.

Correct?

So, this harping is disingenuous.  You can only argue that whomever is in charge of choosing for the **LIFE** of the child must take into consideration that there are people **willing** to be parental (supportive, emotional, financial, etc.) figures in the child's life.  After all, we do not force single mother to have another parental figure in order to have a child.  

To have all that **power** and then force someone into ""indentured servitude"" to serve the mother possibly over the welfare over the child (the current system) is a mockery.","1367367154"

&gt;The statue was eventually moved to a spot outside the Flavian Amphitheatre, which became known, by its proximity to the Colossus, as the Colosseum.

&gt;Many experts agree that the name for the Colosseum is derived from this monument

&gt;as long as the Colossus stands, so shall Rome; when the Colossus falls, Rome shall fall; when Rome falls, so falls the world"").[14] This is often mistranslated to refer to the Colosseum rather than the Colossus (as in, for instance, Byron's poem Childe Harold's Pilgrimage). However, at the time that Bede wrote, the masculine noun coliseus was applied to the statue rather than to what was still known as the Flavian Amphitheatre.

Honestly, the winner take all thing is just a really convoluted way to make sure you can't challenge the winner of the election, you know? Let's say that that distribution I mentioned came up in *every* state somehow. With the electoral college, it means that 100% of the states elected candidate A, and that's a lot harder to dispute than saying 70% of the country didn't vote for A. 


You have to remember that, at the time, the people making up the American government were afraid. They were afraid of the idea of the tumultuous transitions of power they had seen in Europe, they were afraid of one person holding office for the rest of their lives, they were afraid of the people losing their representation (while simultaneously fearing that they were too dumb to use it wisely). So, the result is a bunch of seemingly arbitrary rules to avoid those situations. Rules like the college, the four-year term, the age requirement, and a whole lot more were created in order to ensure the most peaceful transition of power possible.


Personally, I've never really minded the electoral college. I mean, sure, the idea that technically, they can vote for anyone they want despite how the state votes *sounds* scary, but then you realize that this has never happened. If it did, well, some serious shit would go down.


Yes, it's an archaic system, and the advent of technology over the years which has improved vote counting, information gathering, and campaigning has probably made it obsolete, but...some things are just rooted in tradition, you know? Why do some members of the British Parliament wear wigs? Why do judges wear robes to court? Why do we put so much stock in old copies of the Constitution when there are a ton of others? Because it's always been that way. It's silly, but it works...mostly.","1367367157"

Nothing unusual happened (note: we were in the ghetto part of the area) and after an hour or so we hear this loud ""BANG"" from upstairs. 

My cousin and I exchange glances and bolt up the stairs to see if you-know-what had happened and it was nothing like we ever expected. The popcorn bowl had exploded!

Personally, I've been suffering inferior technology since I began working. I *knew* they were inferior, I knew *why*, and I couldn't do a thing about it, mainly because nobody could even [understand](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance) me. To give you an idea, in most places I worked in, next to nobody knew anything about functional programming; next to nobody would dream of rolling their own data format (we have XML, why bother?), let alone a little programming language.

So I *should* feel superior, right?

Well, I don't. My intolerance for bad code makes me less capable of debugging it. Not to mention other [kind of mistakes](http://loup-vaillant.fr/articles/suboptimal-processes) that just depresses me.

On the other hand, my colleague who ""don't know better"" fly through the complexity like sparrows in the air. And they don't seem to have any problem with manual chores that should have been automated long ago.

In the end, I perform *less* than them. How's that for superiority?

But that's probably just because I just ended up feeling miserable (It's been more than four years before I quit my job). I remember doing much better at college.

Measurements: 31 under bust, 38 over bust.

I really can't believe I had my size so wrong for so long as it seems so obvious now. When I took my measurements last week and put them in the calculator I was pretty shocked and my first reaction was ""no, that has to be wrong"". I'd always thought I was just flat chested/small but I'm actually just shallow breasted.

I was measured years ago in M&amp;S and had been going up in the band rather than the cup. I just thought it was normal to be adjusting &amp; pulling at my bra staps during the day because neither the straps or the cups felt right, that it was normal that one of the first things I did when I got home was to take off my bra because I was so much more comfortable without one. I'd always had gaping/wrinkles in the cups so I thought that was because the cups were too big: the whole orange in a glass idea was a revelation.

I went into Change Lingerie at the weekend and got measured there out of curiosity to see what size they'd suggest. The girl tried to put me in a 32D - swooping and scoping gave me serious quadboobs (first time ever!) It didn't inspire confidence in her sizing but thanks to this subreddit I knew what size I was likely to be. 

I'd gone in specifically to try on a 32F and it fitted perfectly: scooped/swooped, I've got a snug but comfortable band, no quadboob, no gaping, no wrinkly cups. I now have a couple of nice, comfortable well fitting bras and it's great. I've been packing boxes with my bra on and I haven't had to tug at the band or adjust it. Last week I'd have either been constantly adjusting my bra or more than likely I'd just have given up and taken it off.
I'll try to get before and after pictures in the next couple of days as I'm so happy to have finally gotten a size that fits after 20 odd years of wearing what I now know was a very wrong size.

The two most famous Absurdists are Soren Kiekegaard and Albert Camus.  Absurdism states that life is inherently meaningless--that it is absurd.  Each of these men believed there were three responses to the absurdity of life.

1) You commit suicide.  This makes sense, because if life is meaningless, it is pointless to be alive.

2)You find meaning through religion/spirituality, a belief in something bigger than you.

3)You accept the absurdity of your life and ignore it because it has no bearing on your day to day life.  You then try to make your own meaning.

Kiekegaard chose number 2 even though he believed it illogical.  Camus chose number 3.  I tend to lean towards accepting the absurdity and just ignoring it.","1367367162"

Really? These Dr. Who cookies are for us? Too bad that I don't like Dr. Who. That's something that THEY like. Not me. I've seen maybe two episodes and didn't like either.

It's more like a modified ""count your blessings"" cliche.

Some people are restless and want to keep looking for someone without any flaws, some people just want to find someone who they can enjoy life with, and some people just don't want to be lonely. As long as these people are happy, who is anyone to say that they're somehow wrong? I think the original advice isn't bad, but just not for everyone. And who knows? Maybe some of those restless people really would be happier if they settled down a little, and in that way, maybe reminding people to reevaluate whether or not they're unhappy with their relationship will actually be a good thing.","1367367163"

I don't doubt that the Subs CAN get you high, being of the synthetic opioid family, but what about the subjective quality of the high?  If you were looking to get high, would you rather buy something you KNOW would get you high or something you've probably never heard of?

Let's say that you did buy it and give it a shot.  Now you're hugging the toilet for literally eight hours.  Are you going to try it again?  Most people won't.  Like 90% of them wouldn't.  It's the same concept where parents used to buy their kids a pack of cigarettes if they wanted to smoke, and then make them keep smoking until they're horribly ill.  It isn't commonplace these days and would probably get you thrown in jail, but it was supposedly pretty effective.

Intellectually you might be able to say sure you'd try it again, but think of the last time you ate and then got sick within an hour or so..everyone always blames the food they just ate, and gets squeamish about going there again.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","I thought we were talking about whether women were at an advantage - Only in terms of this one issue, because we are only making policy recommendations to this one issue.

So as was stated earlier; Women are massively advantaged, men have essentially no choice other then celibacy. A woman can choose to use birth control. If the birth control fails, she can use the morning after pill. If the morning after pill fails, she can have an abortion. **If she decides not to have an abortion, for whatever reason, but doesn't wish to raise the child, she can surrender the child for adoption. If she chooses not to allow the child to be adopted, but later feels as though she would not like to raise the child, she can surrender the child to the state (Safe Haven laws). The father has essentially no say in most of this process - they can choose to remain abstinent, or choose to use birth control. Should the birth control fail, the other party involved in the act then has the option of insisting the man take on an 18 year financial obligation, based on their own decision as to whether or not they would like to have a child. There is no requirement to take the man's wishes into account at all in this decision.**

Access to abortion and birth control may be restricted in the United States, but in most first world nations it's easily obtainable, and encouraged.

I just meant that, it's similar to the littering. They had no awareness...yet.

So much in parenting would change. That younger people think Betty is singularly a monster. Sadly, she was in the norm. :(

I was fairly lucky in that my mom was a bit younger than Betty, and sort of became a Peggy/Joan, even though she had a bunch of kids. My mom was never really like the other parents in that kind of discipline, so was a bit ahead of her time, but in other ways, was in the dark about safety, kids having individual needs, etc. and my dad was just like Don in many ways. Let me tell you-that fucks you up extremely too.

What other women are nurturing mothers? Joan's mom? No. Peggy's ""you're going to get raped"" mom? 

We have generations of bad parenting going on in the show. As well as historically. 

Betty was good in the early years when kids are more dependent, sweet and ""good"" as in not yet asserting independence. She was clueless what to do with them as they start to grow and become more of a challenge, and from what we've see her mother was emotionally abusive and physically abusive in dealing with her weight and body (cutting her hair to punish her etc) starts to follow her parenting model. It was actually a break through for Betty in how she handled a bobby ripping the wallpaper, by being grounded from TV, and not lashing out in extreme anger.

Not trying to defend Betty or any mothers like that, just saying, it's pretty horrifying to watch, but it was the way it was. ","1367367169"

Most noticeable is the lower rise on the Gustins. I'd have to measure to be sure, but the Gustins in between 501STF and 514 as far as rise.

From the thigh through the ankle, I feel the Gustins are cut slightly closer to the leg.

These have stretched after wearing for a couple days. The waist was fairly tight at first, but now it's much more bearable. These are supposed to stretch an inch in waist size over time, so it's pretty much what I've expected.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","All of the free agent stuff--ie making teams wait till later in the offseason, making it known that he was testing the waters, leading multiple teams on, etc. is understandable, it happens any time the best player in any sport becomes a free agent. No GM wants to be known as the guy who couldn't sign Lebron because he spent all of his cap space in July on random free agents. Lebron had a right to take his time and weigh his options and he did. 
The ""Decision"" broadcast was very dramatic and overhyped, but I mean seriously, it was a decision that was going to affect the NBA for a decade, so it deserved the attenetion. Also, the proceeds were going to charity (I don't know how much ESPN made off of it, however), so it seemed cool. A bit melodramatic and cheesy with the B.S. build up and slow crescendo to the actual decision, but hey, I kept watching. 
Then came the fucking pep rally. Fireworks? Hydraulic platforms? Wearing the new jerseys? Only including the 3 'stars?' Then giving the mic's to the players for awkward comments? Jesus Christ that was bad. Plus the ""not 5 not 6..."" bullshit. So all in all I only blame Lebron for his pep-rally gaffes, which made him come off as a cocky, uniformed bully to the rest of the league. As much as I hated to see the Heat lose to the Mavs, you can tell that had a profound effect on Lebron and the way he handles himself as a player. Up until that point he seemed to take basketball for granted; I think he finally realized that he was going to have to put in as much work as Kobe and MJ if he wanted to be considered in that echelon.

"soccer","t5_2qi58","Well, I've seen this amongst fans of several teams, but especially amongst Man Utd fans. A game will be played and there might be a decision that favours one team - a soft penalty, or a wrong red card, or whatever. So naturally, a lot of people complain about the sense of injustice, which is fine. But what really irritates me is the number of people who have to do an elaborate criticism of their own team, just because they benefitted from a ref decision. Something along the lines of:

""I hate to say it, but I've never been more ashamed of Manchester United in my life. This game was rigged to the highest degree. We don't deserve to win it. In fact, I'd recommend that not only is the game replayed, but that the entire team is banned from the Champions League for the next three years. It's only fair. I'm sorry [fans of losing team]. I'm so sorry. You deserved this. You were the greatest ever.""

It just comes across as bullshit karma-whoring. Referees make bad calls. Sometimes your team benefits, sometimes they don't. Just accept it and move on. Your team was robbed of a fair victory just as much as the other team. There's no need so sycophantically go on about it.","1367367175"

I don't understand this whole mentality - there is a better product on the market than regular incandescents, priced well within the budgets of regular American families, that tends to last longer than older types of bulbs. But they aren't buying them because they feel that doing so somehow means they are caving to ""big gov't"", nevermind the data and initiatives by local power companies that shows the benefits of using CFL technology. LED technology is even better, but those bulbs are still fairly expensive.

I think of it like motorcycle riders in ID that don't wear helmets - same mentality. Idaho is one of the last states without a helmet law, and also one of the states with the highest amount of motorcycle-related deaths and TBIs. There was a news report interviewing motorcycle riders and the heads of some motorcycle clubs in ID, asking them to comment on proposed helmet legislation. They all agreed that helmets save lives and prevent brain injuries, but they'll be damned if they're going to let the gov't tell them what to do! So you see riders flying down the highway at 70MPH, no helmet, risking everything to make a statement.

I don't think that they've actually done anything sexual yet, so it's not like a deep sophisticated relationship at this point, but I just am unsure of how to deal with this because I've liked her for a while and it feels weird having a friend date her (no one, not even he, knows I like her, so I know this isn't some sort of joke where he's just pretending to like her to piss me off).","1367367182"

They went around the other side of the mountain. They are the potential problem with the defense stated two pages before: ""Their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley between the arms of the Mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck south and east. Yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to overrun the Mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there was no time to make any other plan, or to summon help.""

There are no cliffs for them to get above the other armies. The other part of the Goblin Host simply went the other way around the mountain and climbed over the slopes. Having climbed a mountain or two, I can assure you that scaling cliffs are not required, especially if you aren't going to the top (and sometimes even if you are, but the goblins did not go over the summit).

They did not stream down the cliffs. They streamed down the slopes. The slopes apparently had their own small cliffs (a slope of a mountain is never a constant grade, but varies), and the goblins who *recklessly* went that way down the **slope** and met with the cliffs fell screaming.

There certainly isn't anything about 'quickly'. They got themselves into place only after such a time as the first host, in the valley, was broken and sent running.

"changemyview","t5_2w2s8","Good question.  I think - in a nutshell - the flaws lie in the fact that we don't listen to experts.  **Here's a secret:** the field of education knows how to teach students to be critical thinkers, to be persistent in their work, to think creatively, to be compassionate and moral citizens, etc etc.  Plenty of countries do education very well, and we know what they are doing right and why it works.  Good news, right?  We just need to adopt similar policies to have good education in America.

But unfortunately:

Educational policy at the top is lead by politicians, who get elected/stay in office by endorsing programs that make for good sound bites, but leaders in the field believe (based on mountains of peer reviewed research) will do nothing but hurt students.  School boards are just as bad, although usually not as sinister - just sorta like, ""hey, mr. smith is running!  he's a nice guy, let's vote for him.""  This becomes problematic when the board (usually busy people that work in demanding fields, like law, medicine, etc) actually needs to make serious policy decisions, and none of them can be bothered to read relevant articles/studies when requested (or they just don't care).

On top of that, educators get the squeeze constantly.  I don't know whether to laugh or cry when pundits actually say things like ""teachers are over paid,"" ""it's an easy job,"" and so on.  Not only are we overworked, but we're not even respected (oh sure, there's lip service, but it's nothing more than that).  Lots of teachers have the good sense to quit.  People like me are bitter, and I'm already sorta looking around at the job market, even though early childhood education (kindergarten) is my passion and where all my strength lie.  People like me are typical.

What we need to do, in effect, is transform our society completely to really value education - to know how great it is to live in an educated society, and know how bad it is to live in one that isn't.  And we need to value educators, and respect the opinions of experts in the field.  It needs to be all-in, not half-assed.  I don't expect this to happen any time soon, and right now, things are bad, really, really fucking bad.  Broken is almost a euphemism.  I just hope the aftermath will help set our priorities straight.

...just one quick example so you know what the fuck I'm talking about: if I say it's a good idea for Johnny to play in dramatic play, at school, for an hour a day, with the goal of making Johnny a better reader, writer, increase his number sense, develop prosocial behavior, etc, then FUCKING **LISTEN** TO ME.  YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT OPINION?  YOU WANT JOHNNY TO DO WORKSHEETS INSTEAD?  GREAT!  NOW HE HATES MATH AND ENGLISH... GIVE IT A MONTH OR TWO... AND NOW HE HATES SCHOOL, TOO, AND DOESN'T BELIEVE IN HIS ABILITY TO LEARN!  GOOD THING WE IGNORED THE PERSON WHO STUDIED THIS SUBJECT IN DEPTH FOR EIGHT GOD DAMN YEARS BECAUSE YOU JUST KINDA FELT THAT WORKSHEETS WERE A BETTER IDEA AND DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THE FUCK WE HAVE DRAMATIC PLAY TO BEGIN WITH.

&gt;The idea behind abortion is that women should have the right to choose what they do or don't do with their bodies. Birth control can fail, condoms can break, or even a mistake can happen. Abortion is not the easy fix many people say it is; it's very stressful and emotional to most women, and so a lot of thought goes into it and depression is common post-abortion.

&gt;Getting that out of the way, some people think it's unfair that women can say that they don't consent to the possibility of parenthood as the result of sex, but men do. You can argue that in anyway you want, but biology is biology, and men generally don't carry and birth the child (except Arnold Schwarzenegger). And of course, if a child is to be brought into existence, he or she has the right to the best support possible growing up. This means having support from the mother and the father, even if it's just in the form of child support.

&gt;This of course raises issues. If you allow women to get abortions, but don't allow men to financially abort using biology as a reason, then it sets up the precedent that differences in biology can be basis for other differential treatment between men and women. Women are the ones that get pregnant, well then women are the ones who have the potential to take extended leave from work and burden their employers with maternal leave. This opens up the door for justifying hiring men who will on average require less leave, most likely produce more for the company, and from a business/ economic perspective be better employees.

&gt;Of course, people will use whatever semantic gymnastics they can to justify why women's pregnancy can only be used for unequal treatment in certain situation but not in others, but I haven't heard a good argument yet. And as far as I know, more men get jobs than get a woman pregnant who disagrees with him not wanting it.

I am currently loving the shit out of Game of Thrones. 

Anime:
Angel Beats! and Teen titans are what we are watching in our anime club. Other notable mentions go to Rurouni Kenshin, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Code Geass, and Outlaw Star. 

Book:
I sadly do not read that much. Last book series I enjoyed was Darran Shans Cirque du Freak. 

Place:
My house. Nothing like having your own place shared with people you love. 

Food:
Cereal, Ice Cream, peanut butter and jelly samiches, and pasta. My food pyramid right there. 

Drink:
I rather fancy teas. Though Cherry coke and Dr. Pepper are up there on my list.

Desert:
Everything I eat is techincally a desert. 

Game: 
Everything made by Fantasy Flight and all the games you see on the shelves of the game stores that cost 50-90$

----

We are 4 episodes into Angel Beats and we still have no idea what is going on. I hear it gets pretty deep and tear jerking later on, though. ","1367367197"

"TransSpace","t5_2telm","What do you mean? The groups pre-stonewall such as the Mattachine Society and the Daughters of Bilitis etc were not exactly privileged groups in society(other than them having resources in money--and those were only those who could start groups at all--in fear--others were not so lucky), and the movement that was created after stonewall were really focused on LG things...there was not a lot for trans* folk going on in relation to the gay and lesbian movement at the time. If you mean by privileged that they were maybe the most privileged during that time due to reports such as the Kinsey Reports where gays and lesbians could realize that there were others like them. That being said, those LG groups were fighting privilege as well in a really oppressive era. 

That is really what the movement was about. The individuals who fought back during Stonewall who were trans* were really the lowest of the low of the LGBT groups, and the groups that grew out of that mobilizing event (because of a march made to commemorate it) were mainly focused on LG things. Maybe they were tired of the raids on gay bars, but those raids happened everywhere. They just happened to be the ones that fought back.

Maybe we are just talking about different kinds of power? I'm not saying that trans* people haven't been crapped on in the movement, I'm just saying that people give too much credit to Stonewall as a whole, and sometimes that really gives less credit to all of the crap that LG people faced during the time as well. (Such as you saying that people who talk about pre-stonewall beginnings just are privileged groups who want a role model...)","1367367197"
"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","wow I'm in the same situation. I Really wish I could come to this conclusion but for some reason I keep crying over her. She's the only woman I've ever loved and the only girl I've ever introduced to my mom. She wants her space and I get it. All through graduate school I was super stressed and essentially became just a burden she couldn't deal with anymore. Man I don't know how to get over her and I keep hoping she'll come back. We still text and talk and I know She'd be there if I ever needed her, but now she just wants her space and claims she wants to laugh and feel free again. I guess the break up is my fault, because the last year of our relationship I stopped being her friend and somehow turned into the super serious hubby type and she caught on to that. I blame it on the stress of graduate school and taking my licensure examinations, although I don't regret how hard I've worked, I do regret losing her...","1367367198"

"printmaking","t5_2s1dd","Sorry for the delay in responding to this! These past (almost) 3 weeks have been me frantically working on this project. It's due tomorrow, and I JUST NOW finished it.

ANYWAY. Spit bite. I was running into a lot of problems with it, the main one being inconsistency. I had made a little test plate of ferric at different time intervals, going from 1 - 5 minutes. It got me the tonal range I needed, and was expecting it to work on a larger scale. However, when I tried spit biting larger areas this way, the same time interval rarely worked. I also ran into issues with aquatint. Initially, I used rosin, but quickly got frustrated with it (my school's ""rosin booth"" is a miserable thing). I switched to using spray paint, because I'm cheap &amp; that's what I learned on. When I would try a spit bite with that, I would unintentionally scrub off the spray paint, leading to the acid just biting straight down &amp; not holding any ink. This caused significant problems on one plate; thankfully I was able to salvage it.

In the end, I decided to try the stop-out method &amp; work in 30-second intervals. Here's an example of what spit bite vs. stop out ended looking like for me: http://imgur.com/lZ4pCyy","1367367202"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","haha middle school. sounds rough. My worst year was 2010. I had a job I loved, a sexy girlfriend (that I also loved), was in a band.  The band thing only got more girls clamoring for my balls-nuts.

Out of the blue one night (Sept. 11, 2010 to be exact), I have a seizure and a vein in my brain ruptured.  As I die slowly on my bedroom floor, writhing around in my own vomit, my roommate decides I'm drunk and calls my girlfriend to help clean my drunk ass up (at 3 in the morning).  Thankfully, she shows up and can tell I'm not drunk but dying.  Ambulance arrives and the dumb fucks think I'm drunk too.  Until one guy shows up and notices that the blood coming out of my ears and mouth might be a sign of something, I don't know, REALLY fucked up happening in my head.

I'm rushed to a waiting helicopter and, get life-flighted to a shitty local hospital that can't help.  They fly me to a real hospital where I live on death's edge until an operating room opens up.  Surgery is successful but, the blood damaged the right side of my brain so bad that I'm completely paralyzed on my left side.  I mean completely, left side of my face, left hand, arm, foot leg; nothing works. So, even though nurses and doctors are telling my loved ones that I'm probably going to die or at least be wheelchair bound for the rest of my life, I manage to survive.

Then I spend 6 weeks in a rehab hospital, relearning to walk and think and use my left hand/arm.  Then a few more months of outpatient rehab that taught me to walk without the cane.

All of this took less than a year.  I went back to the job but left after a year because I was wasting my time.  Now I'm back in college, senior, graduating next year.

"AskUK","t5_2t4s3","Landlord reporting in....

If you have proof in regards to the Student loans it may be possible to delay the eviction when it goes to county court to be heard. Take all the documentary evidence you have especially if there are letters stating that the amount is owed and when it is to be paid. 

Did the Landlord issue a Section 8 notice or a Section 21? If it is a Section 21 then the timing and wording of the notice is super-critical. If the wording was not correct and the Section 21 was not served on the correct date you can use this to get the notice invalidated. The Landlord would have to effectively start again from scratch. 

Now if the Landlord has issued a Section 8 because you're more than 2 months behind with arrears then the same time-critical requirements do not exist.

In both cases if you don't then leave by the expiry of the notice the landlord has to go to court to get a notice of possession. If you still don't leave then the landlord has to go back to court yet again to get a warrant of eviction and it is only at this final step that everything has been exhausted and bailiffs can remove you from the property. Up until that warrant is executed you can stay in the property.

I am not here to convince people to become atheists, and couldn't care less if anyone here does, but if I do have an agenda it involves convincing people to tolerate gays in American society, and failing that to prevent them in 20 years from saying they were homophobic when they were younger because nobody told them they shouldn't be.

It doesn't take faith to not believe in God, any more than you need faith to not believe in any of the Gods you don't believe in or possibly don't even know about. I just don't do that stuff in my brain, and never really have. I don't eat fish either, and it requires about as much effort in either case.

"spicy","t5_2s1qd","Extract sauces have some good uses - but if that is really 3.5 million scovilles you are not going to want to use it like you would any other hot sauce.

Use #1: Convince your friends who think they are tough to try just a drop on the end of their finger. It will bring most of them to their knees and laughs will ensue.

Use #3: Heat up your mild hot sauces that you like but would rather be hotter. (eg I love Louisiana hot sauce for the tangy flavor - but it is not hot enough for me. A little extract addition goes a long way.)

Use #3: Like the dude at the store said, add it to chili/stir fry etc that you want to spice up without changing the flavor. Because you add so little you get the heat you want without changing the other flavors of your recipe. I would prefer to just add certain hot peppers (fresh or powdered) to my recipe's because I like how the peppers taste. 

Use #4: Add spice to difficult-to-add-spice-to-things and experiment. Ever tried to make your spaghetti noodles themselves spicy? A dash of that sauce in the water you boil your noodles in will make add spice to the noodle itself and not the sauce etc. Its a cool sensation. Also try adding it to cornbread etc. 

Use #5: Keep your dog from getting into shit he's not supposed to. If he gets a lick of this stuff when he's trying to get into the trash can, he wont be coming back. 

Use #6: If you ever get attacked, spray it in the intruder's eyes. 3.5 Million scovilles is on par with most commercial pepper sprays.","1367367216"

I was watching him play 10/20 Pot Limit Omaha and bought in for $10,000 and was watching him every time i get a chance to.

He was up about $10,000 by the time i got off my shift and as it turns out when I came back to my shift the next day, he ended up cashing about $92,000 and was really funny because of all the stories that I heard that people were calling each others friends to take a piece of this guy for his money.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I would encourage you to read [this FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/sex/wiki/index#wiki_orgasm_troubles) and in particular, [this article](http://www.sexpertslounge.com/2011/12/20/fixation-on-orgasm/). Many women of your gf's age have never experienced orgasm, and of those who have, most need some form of clitoral stimulation to orgasm. If she's reached orgasm via masturbation before, what did it for her? Does she currently masturbate? Masturbation is not entirely a prerequisite for orgasm, but it will allow her to learn what she needs to orgasm, which will make it much easier for you to re-create that with her. Chances are, she'll need to learn what works for her on her own before you'll be able to bring her to orgasm.

With that out of the way, I should point out that fixating on orgasm will not be helpful, and will likely make it much more difficult for her to actually achieve orgasm. Try focusing on pleasuring each other and enjoying each others' bodies instead. So long as both of you enjoy yourselves and feel satisfied, why does it matter how many orgasms each of you has had?

There is no clear information in this report that suggests that this problem was caused by any particular government.

We were informed that discussions took place between the departments and agencies and the Secretariat as part of the normal program challenge function. However, financial information on reallocations was not captured.""

No information about reallocations = they don't know how the money was spent. They had time to figure it out after the AG asked them. They didn't. Problem not solved.

More creatures - it's a good idea to be running at least 16-17 creatures in a 40 card deck, unless you have a strong reason to do otherwise. Kraul Warrior and Riot Piker are pretty good 2-drops, and with 3 guildgates, the Smelt-ward Gatekeepers are probably worth it.

Weaker cards - Awe for the Guilds is not really good, especially if you don't have a strong creature-based board to actually take advantage of it. Plus, there's no shortage of multicolor in this format. Toil//Trouble is *ok*, as is goblin rally. Mending Touch and Predator's Rapport are ok, but there's probably stronger choices.

Number of colors - despite the fixing, I'd try to max at 3. Two is preferable, but that's not always doable. I'd *maybe* splash a 4th, for a bomby rare (like adding 2-3 blue sources for Mirko Vosk, Mind Drinker, since he can end games quickly in your favor)

3. Unplug all power connectors and front-panel headers.

4. Remove all expansion cards.

5. Take out the backplate if you're using an aftermarket CPU cooler.

7. Take out the I/O shield and replace it.

8. Screw the new motherboard back in, and start reassembling everything.

15 million out of 300+ million is not overwhelming.

Common sense, not the bible would lead anyone to believe that an arbitrary number of cells is a ridiculous test of someones humanity.

I don't think ill of you since you asked. Just think your caught up in the brainwashing of the masses.

If i was in charge of the world, 

1.  There are hundreds and hundreds of thousands of non incest humans born with severe disabilities unrelated to incest. My cousin is a perfect example of that. Would I wish him dead? No. And neither would any member of my family.  So no, Incest is not a cause for us to murder anyone.

2. If a woman is forcibly raped, how absolutely horrible for her. Should the human she is carrying be murdered because of another mans crime?
Of course not.  There are thousands and thousands of people willing to adopt that human child and give it all the love and care it will ever need. ( Sadly the OP did not understand this.)  Terrible the woman has to bear a human that is not of her own suitors choosing, but it is hardly a reason to murder a human.

3. This of course is the one that can give most pause.  Most I know would condone the murder of the child to save the life of the mother.
Since you asked my opinion on it,  No. 

I would not want the human murdered to save her. My mother, my sister, my wife whomever.Terrible and disgusting situation. Very very much so.  Sadly we spend trillions on war and pennies compared to research to save the both.

If I was ruler like you said, trillions would be poured into saving the human baby and the human mother.

Starvation by Ace Hood. I was late to the Ace Hood train, downloaded as part of my ""download everything on the /r/trapmuzik essentials spree. Actually some really impressive stuff, nice balance of yelling bangers and more contemplative stuff. I think Ace might be just as good as Meek Mill. Perhaps a bit slept on. Went and downloaded Starvation 2 now, but haven't had a chance to really listen to it.

Endroducing by DJ Shadow. It is finals season, and I always study to instrumentals. Last semester it was Clams Casino and Fly Lo. This semester it is MF DOOM and DJ Shadow. I had heard the album before, but this has given me a chance to really appreciate it. 

Twelve Reasons to Die by Ghostface and Adrian Younge. Really cinematic stuff, think like a modern super soundtrack quality sounding version of OB4CL and classic Ghost albums like FishScale. The concept is fairly flimsy, and typical Ghost stuff(""I run a mob, have a mob war, fall in love, get back stabbed, killed and come back and exact vengeance""), but it serves to tie the tracks together. Good new Ghost album. Not the level of his biggest 3 albums, but it very solidly in the 2nd tier of Wu solo works like OB4CL2.

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","To anyone saying ""who cares if its fake? as long as it plays well"", everyone should care. FMIC &amp; other huge companies rely on their brand's public image to justify INSANE markups, cutting corners with imported materials, &amp; offsiting labor wherever possible to maximize profits. Most people do not know that they can get, have built, or build a non branded replica of almost any electric guitar ever made, for a fraction of the cost compared to the branded one. Even the people that do still often choose to buy a branded guitar because of the intangibles such as build quality, resale value, warranty, etc. Don't get me started on tone woods but I'm referencing material cost or even unit cost vs street price or MSRP. OK, it's a for profit company in a competitive market w/ massive overhead that stuff costs $$$ pass it on whatever. However if you compare some of the luthier built replicas or high quality clones, it is damn near impossible to tell the differences. Without tearing it apart for careful inspection (ever see how they date/verify vintage guitars now?) the price tag being at least 2x could be the only way to tell, assuming an honest reseller. THIS IS THE INSANE MARKUP I MENTIONED. Good counterfeiters have the waterslide decals, serial numbers, everything down. Therefore, as consumers without the ability to tear down a potential MIA strat purchase to compare serials &amp; component markings, WE HAVE TO RELY ON RESELLERS TO BE EDUCATED, THOROUGH, &amp; HONEST. Who's to say this guy's not intentionally rebranding fake guitars to get in on the profit multiplier that having Fender on the headstock commands? Guess whos gets ripped off? This is why everone should care.","1367367247"

You missed the part where I said 
&gt;If you aren't playing the game seriously it doesn't matter if you click or keyboard turn.

But once you get into any current level group content where other people are taking the game seriously. Any meaning 5 mans, LFR, normals and heroic raids. If you're keyboard turning you can and will wipe your group. If you kill yourself and you're filling a healing or tank spot that can wipe any group, even your LFR group. I did an LFR where the tank way keyboard turning while tanking Horridon. He cleaved the raid so many times I nearly vomited. Not to mention people who keyboard turn and click generally don't try to preform at an optimal level. Meaning they don't know the fights, don't know how to gear and can barely click their abilities. These people who don't care get into groups and if there is enough of them they will waste everyone else's time by causing wipes.

Bottom line is  you're actively hurting your performance by keyboard turning or clicking. Its not hard to stop keyboard turning or clicking it takes maybe a week of forcing yourself to do it until you can play fine.","1367367250"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Perhaps rape and genocide were poor examples of what I was trying to communicate.

Being called 'anti-rapist' would at least be clear on what my position is.

'Anti-theist', especially to the people we're trying to convince to change their ways, is seen as combative and aggressive (its not that aggression is entirely uncalled for, its just that it clearly isn't useful for most situations).

'Theism', much like 'religion', is a term that describes a fairly large amount of different ideas which entail different consequences.

I'm far less worried about the theists whose terrestrial concerns rest with whether or not they should end a failing marriage in divorce than I am with the ones whose beliefs justify simply murdering their spouse to preserve their honour and moving on to the next.

Essentially, what I'm saying is that being opposed to religion need not prevent us from noticing the differences among religions, irrespective of the fact that they all appear to be mistaken about the nature of the universe and humanity's place within it, and would argue that adopting a label that doesn't accurately describe my concerns may only help alienate the religious people we currently have the best chance of reaching through means of rational and critical discussion.

"Eve","t5_2qil9","&gt;Theories are that higher fuel costs means jump-freighering becomes less attractive.

Exactly.  

Most production is done enmass, and then sold to the masses.  Where do that vast majority of products being sold get sold?  Jita, Amarr, Rens etc.  Highsec.  That's where the market is for all 0.0 alliances, lowsec alliances, and highsec alliances and soloers.  

This has made it harder and more expensive to build something in 0.0 and move it to where the major market is (Not to mention screw over individuals like me with capitals not involved in it in any way.  This is going to suck for my single POS and my carrier).

Highsec hubs sell to EVERYONE.  A 0.0 station only sells to blues.  Selling only in house cuts out a lot of potential buyers.  

Not only that, but making it harder to bring materials from Highsec to Null via this, you then need to mine grav sites.  Is there honestly enough people mining in grav sites for this to help?  Especially now that their risk increased a thousand fold?  Instead of several minutes to find them with probes that can be picked up on D-scan, a grav site can be pinpointed within seconds.


TL:DR Yes, it would be a bit easier now to build stuff out there.  
But coupled with it being much more expensive moving the goods to a highsec hub, that a 0.0 market is going to be more expensive than a Highsec hub market for buyers so fewer are going to buy, and many times less potential buyers, harder to move minerals, more dangerous to mine minerals...  


I'm just dubious this is really going to have that much of an impact.

Most of this shake up is, in my view, going to be because smaller independent producers aren't going to be able to keep production POSes going because of skyrocketing iso prices, and would have to shut down.  I'm already getting worried about my POS that I have.","1367367253"

It's an overwhelming cycle of shame and embarrassment.

I've tried anti-depressants for the anxiety. They helped for a while, but I ended up quitting them for other reasons.

Talk therapy was helpful. The meds were helpful, but troublesome for other reasons. Like other commenters have said, figuring out your triggers helps and finding something else to do with your hands helps as well.

There is a sub-reddit, [/r/Trichsters](http://www.reddit.com/r/Trichsters/), for people with trich, but people who pick their skin belong to it as well, if you're interested in a virtual support group.

For these next two, what I do is mix them together in a glass of cranberry juice in the morning and at night, following the directions on the label of starting small and slowly increasing the amount. For short periods (which I would do right at the beginning, for a few days) you can do use the bentonite like 5 times a day (so use it without the pysllium in the afternoon), then cut back to once in the morning, once at night again.

[Bentonite](http://www.amazon.com/Yerba-Prima-Bentonite-Detox-Ounce/dp/B00016XI7A/ref=sr_1_1?s=hpc&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367366499&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=detox+bentonite)

[Pysllium](http://www.amazon.com/Yerba-Prima-Psyllium-Whole-12-Ounce/dp/B00013YYKS/ref=pd_sim_hpc_2)

Both of these combined = a lot of fiber and cleansing. You may get constipated, you may be pooping a lot. I wouldn't recommend doing them both for the first time, at the same time. Try the bentonite and psyllium first, do it for 5 days or so, then the pills. 

1. There isn't a way to really speed up the process, it's more like you just want to hit it HARD. Drink water, no trees or booze, exercise are all great. Employing detox methods like the ones I mentioned above can help kick it in the pants.

2. I've been able to pass a test within 2 weeks by cutting out all bud and doing this regime + lots of water, general exercise, eating well, etc. I have never been a very heavy smoker (I'm 5'6, 150lb, smoke 1/8th a month). So, take that for what it's worth.

3. I think less fat = faster metabolism, and less room for stuff to stick around. I know NOTHING, but I'd assume less fat would be a good thing.

4. While you're at the store getting those awesome detox supplies I recommended or looking on amazon, pick up some melatonin, and maybe some other natural sleep meds. Melatonin is GREAT and has always helped me for short term sleep issues. Other sleep meds should definitely work, especially if you're never used them before. ;)

Hope this helps girl!","1367367264"

Moreover, it's been shown that races still largely self-segregate, and studies repeatedly demonstrate the best way to get a job is to know someone within the company. Whites are more likely to be employed, and to be employed in desirable fields, than blacks.

So if you're a white person who wants to get into a company, you're simply more likely to know an employed person there than an otherwise similar black applicant. Until our social networks are less racially segregated that's going to remain true. No idea how to make that happen; there's so many historical and modern influences that go into American remaining stratified.

I also saw a study recently that showed that a black employee was less likely to stick his/her neck out for a friend to try to get them a job, because they're afraid of being judged as having some ""black agenda,"" or favoring their own race too much.

&gt; ""The demand for our facilities and services could be adversely affected by the relaxation of enforcement efforts, leniency in conviction or parole standards and sentencing practices or through the decriminalization of certain activities that are currently proscribed by our criminal laws. For instance, any changes with respect to drugs and controlled substances or illegal immigration could affect the number of persons arrested, convicted, and sentenced, thereby potentially reducing demand for correctional facilities to house them.""[32]  ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrections_Corporation_of_America))

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","It's never a bad thing to ask questions. A lot of this type of drama could be avoided if people knew more about the subject.

Transgender people have the unique case among the ""I think I'm something else"" group in that the thing they are trying to be is neither a specific, idealized identity (such as anorexics with a distorted body image or would-be prophets) nor a hard-wired identity that cannot have formed biologically in a human being (much to the chagrin of otherkin, there is nothing in the human genome that could possibly form even part of a wolf brain).

It is instead a more nebulous discomfort with their body - they may have an idea of what they want to look like post-transition, but they will not feel their current type of discomfort (called dysphoria) if they transitioned successfully but did not look exactly how they expected (an especially vain one may be slightly upset, but their dysphoria - that horrible feeling that comes from the conflict between their gender identity and physical body - would no longer be there). Contrast this with an anorexic - they don't have a ""stopping point"", or milestone of thinness that will alleviate their type of discomfort with their body - they will always see themselves as fat and want to be thinner.

The key step in understanding this is to ask what, if anything, is physically going on in trans people's brains that is different from what occurs in the brain of an anorexic or a Jesus-kin. Although we have only recently had the medical technology to find minute (but significant) abnormalities in brain structures, we have discovered some very interesting results from analyzing the brains of trans people.

&gt;Male-to-Female Transsexuals Have Female Neuron Numbers in a Limbic Nucleus: http://jcem.endojournals.org/cgi/content/full/85/5/2034

&gt;Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids: http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/18/8/1900

&gt;White matter microstructure in female to male transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024

&gt;Neuroimaging Differences in Spatial Cognition between Men and Male-to-Female Transsexuals Before and During Hormone Therapy: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1743-6109.2009.01484.x/abstract

These are only a small sample of what's been done, but they illustrate the fact that trans people appear to have some of the opposite gender's brain structures in key areas. It should be emphasized that these studies still found these results - and this is key - *even in people who have never tried transitioning or getting hormone replacement therapy*. This means that these differences were there from birth, and were not the product of transitioning - key parts of trans people's brains are quite literally of the gender they identify as.

An easy way to think about this is to liken trans people to someone who is intersex (someone born with ambiguous genitalia), except instead of having contrasting male and female structures (thing that sticks out or thing that doesn't stick out) that are obvious and easily visible, they are hidden away in their brain.

There are several theories about how this happens, but the most popular one which has a good about recent evidence to back it up is that, like many other body structures, key areas of the brain develop into one of two sexually dimorphic possibilities (male or female) depending on the amount of androgens in the fetus's system during a specific time during early development. All fetuses begin development as females, but branch off in their development path later in the pregnancy via mechanisms started by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome (the androgen surge being one of those processes).

In trans people, the surge (or lack thereof) in the hormones either fails to completely change all the important the brain structures (MtF), leaving many of them female, or occurs when it isn't supposed to (FtM) and masculinizes the brain in an otherwise female individual (this hormonal misfiring or failure is the same process that is speculated to cause homosexuality). In some extreme cases, it is even possible for an individual with an XY karyotype to be born [completely female] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_androgen_insensitivity_syndrome) (although this is helped in part due to a defect that makes their organs completely incapable of responding normally to androgens - this also means no armpit or pubic hair).

The argument over whether or not to consider someone to be what they identify as is purely ideological when there is an absence of any evidence to corroborate the person's claim, but in the case of trans people we have managed to peer into the brain and have discovered, as is often the case in science, that our original, intuitive question of whether someone is ""really"" male or ""really"" female no longer makes sense in light of what we have learned. Instead, we have a much more complicated (but much more correct) idea of what makes someone identify as one gender or another.

**tl;dr**: Their brain (the important gender identifying-related parts, at least) actually physically is the gender they claim that they are. This is not the case in other identities that contrast with the persons body, since the brain structures in question can only be male or female, not dragon or Jesus.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'll be 22 on the 23rd of May, so I wouldn't consider myself old, but I'm definitely starting to mature a little more.  I moved out of my parents house just over a year ago and started living at my grandfather's house a few states away.  I pay him rent, along with my bills and I buy my own groceries and all that, while he basically pays for all the utilities.  He originally got a job opportunity in Thailand and was paying me to house sit while he was gone.  He got back and allowed me to continue living there as I had no real plans and I didn't want to move back to the town I grew up in for fear of never getting out.

Throughout the past year, I've continued drinking and smoking pot on occasion, but over the course of the past 6 months, those things have interested me less and less. I was also living from paycheck to paycheck for most of the year. I've taken a lot of time to ""find"" myself and I've actually learned quite a bit about who I am and what I want. 

Around mid December, I decided I was going to go back to school.  I still didn't really have any plans, but I wanted to at least work toward an Associate's Degree so I at least had something.  I applied to the local community college and got a few transferrable credits (I went to a Penn State branch for two years, let's just say, I didn't do well). With no real direction, I decided to enter as a General Studies major, but I've since decided I would like to go into either Journalism or Public Relations, as I've always been a fairly competent writer. I've been paying to put myself through it out of pocket for the past 3 months and it's given me a little more responsibility with my money.  Next week will mark my first successful semester of college. 

About a month ago, I began training for my first triathlon that will take place in August.  My father and cousin are both really into triathlons, marathons, etc. and they both accomplished their first Iron Man in Louisville last year.  Having experienced it as a bystander, it really got to me.  I intend to participate in my first Iron Man in 2014 and I only plan to improve from there.  This is the first thing I've felt completely motivated for since running cross country in high school.  Even then, I was really only working to get by instead of working to excel.  I've lost almost 15 lbs in the past month and almost half an inch on my waist, which is really helping to keep me motivated.

Yesterday was the first day I really stopped and thought, ""I'm growing up"".  I went to the grocery store and spent about $90.  It was the first time I've spent that much on only healthy food.  I bought a huge variety of vegetables, chicken, spices, etc. and a case of corona because I had some extra cash and like to enjoy a beer or two a few night a week.  I'm making my own meals and using leftovers as meals throughout the week, drinking plenty of water, and waking up before 10 (sometimes earlier, depending on work).  Honestly, I haven't felt this good in years.  I'm hardly ever exhausted anymore, I feel stronger and more alert, and I've built up quite a bit of confidence which has motivated me to start talking to a girl I work with.

For me, these things have been huge milestones which shows me that I'm maturing a little.  I'm still completely capable of being an immature moron, but that's more that I don't want to completely grow up than anything.

tl;dr Not old, just growing up.","1367367274"

Basically, minerals/salts being drawn to the surface after water infiltration. I'd be suspicious of leakage from the bathroom above. Can you get a drywall/plaster knife and cut out a square around the bloom, to see if you've got a problem above? Assuming the ceiling is drywall, you'll have to remove and patch this anyway. If it's plaster, I'd still want to see what's going on upstairs, but you'll need to remove the loose plaster (go at it gently with a stiff putty knife and knock off only what is separating from the lath), then repair with a coat of Plaster-Weld plus a few passes with a setting type of plaster. Don't trash the lath/mesh.

As far as the leak, have you noticed any water on the floor upstairs? If there's a hidden leak, it could be as simple as the shower head aimed at a part of the tile/surround/tub where water can drip back behind and wick down the wall. It could be a burst copper pipe (it can happen, especially with cheaper --thinner-- copper). It could be a leak in a valve, or wet feet getting out of the shower on a permeable floor. Your caulk could be failing. The wax seal under your toilet might have shifted with some He-Man unclogging. Point is, it could be many, many things -- but efflorescence usually indicates a long period of water contact. Time to put on your detective hat and think like water; where might it be coming from and where would it want to go?

I wouldn't fix anything until I figure out the source of the leak, because otherwise your repair will just be damaged again.","1367367277"

"PokemonAndPeril","t5_2x2bt","This is certainly a workable system, but I think we can do better.  A few thoughts, in no particular order:

1.  A table top game doesn't really handle breeding or catching tons of redundant pokemon very well.  As such, a non-favorable nature is a real kick in the teeth.  I think natures should be only positive.

2.  A simple +1/-1 won't mean very much by the end of the game.  We could do +10%/-10% or +1/-1 each level, but:

3.  This is a good opportunity to characterize the pokemon, which is otherwise lacking.  A lot of people who want to play a pokemon rpg are going to do so with plushies of the relevant pokemon in front of them.  They want to make friends with pokemon and go on adventures.  The more the system tells them about those pokemon, the easier time they'll have imagining them.  Giving each pokemon little flavorful abilities like +1 vs fear because they're brave or +1 to spot checks because they're curious is a good way of doing that.  We might also look into a way to implement the flavor text from [characteristics.] (http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Characteristic) (Just the flavor text, not IV's as a whole.)

TL;DR: this is the default solution, but there's room to improve it.","1367367279"

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","Hmm. Saying an action shouldn't be performed only makes sense in the context of someone else first saying that something *should* be performed, in which case the burden of proof is on the latter person.

It's like someone saying ""I should punch you in the face"" and the other person saying ""You should not punch me in the face."" I mean, yeah, they're making a claim, but it's a claim that can only be made in response to a first claim. Similarly, Ancaps don't go around telling peaceful people to stop doing things, at the core of it, they're only telling people to stop ""initiating force"". And since every initiation of force is a claim (or is it?), the burden of proof is on them.

"keto","t5_2rske","Oooh how you made me laugh in your post! Lol. You're awesome!

In theory, I would like to be able to just cook the exact same thing every day, that way I would know 100% I'm getting it right and also not stress about ""what am I going to do tonight.."". I don't have a love of cooking so cooking stresses me lol.

For about a year and a half I cut out all sweets/pop/cakes etc but then I began to slip and I ""let go"" I have piled on all the weight I lost so now I am turning to keto to try to lose it all over again. I don't find cutting out pop/sweets etc too difficult so I believe I can do that if I try.

I **definitely** hear you when you said ""my favorite tv show is on = time for food"". I grew up with my parents always having the tv on when we ate, it wasn't ""sit on a couch with a tray"" kind of thing but it was always on so now I seem to have this desire to always watch something when I'm eating. This makes it easier to ""overeat"" or to want to eat when I'm watching a favorite show although I try not to.

You are right in what you said about stomach growling, that really hit home and someone else said something similar that if your stomach isn't growling but you're carving to drink some water, which I will try too.

Will be checking the label for carbs and trying to learn more. Same mentality as me, mine is ""better out than in"" if I know it's bad for me or I am not sure. Thank you again for your reply. =)","1367367283"

Core i5/8gb good for games

Decent case and PSU to run your components. Semi modular PSU.

WIFI storage speakers and 1080p monitor included.

I went with the more powerful/expensive 3470 for your CPU, because i think if you were to upgrade anything, it would be the GPU. And when you do, the rest of your system should still be fine. If i went for a more appropriate CPU to your GPU, youll just end up replacing the whole lot when you hit performance walls.

The white man wants us to bash on the other minority while he watches at bay until he is able to conquer. Why do you think black on black crime is rampant or minority on minorty crime is higher then white on white? The mere fact that you say hispanic shows how ignorant you are of your own social location and the history behind the word. You know what i got out of you saying hispanic? I dont know who i truly am and used a word coined by the US government from the 1970 to group a bunch of nationalities and ethnicities because to the white man your identity is not as important to be noted. if you didn't get any of, ""The term lumps millions of people from different racial, ethnic, religious, socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds who usually have little in common except, perhaps, language. It is racist because it says to the people to whom it is applied that they are too unimportant and insignificant for the speaker to bother learning and appreciating the difference among their countries.

"promos","t5_2r4w1","As a web developer myself, I can totally relate to where he is coming from. The truth is, it isn't a massive problem, but it is still a problem. Especially for websites like reddit and technology-oriented websites, where the majority of the visitors are tech-savvy, it means a much greater percentage of people who will be blocking your advertisements. In many cases the profit for small websites isn't very significant, so even the lightest of blows like that can hurt. 

Personally, I'm glad they are letting non-intrusive advertisements through, because it means honest websites that mean the best for their viewers will get a good chance to 'make it'. 

The part about the 'put the net behind a paywall' is because if everybody used a program/extension like AdBlock, websites would cost more to run than owners would get from the ad revenue, and that means the business model will change, which could very well end up with more subscription-based websites crowding the web. As a counter-argument, you might say there will always be a website to take their place that was free, you would be right in the short run I'm sure, but eventually they will see that it is simply not profitable and either go offline or be forced to switch how it earns it's money as well.

I will note, as a web developer, I also disagree with many of the tactics some of the worse advertisement agencies are using; IE pop-ups/unders, flashy ads, entire background-clickable ads, etc. Reddit is one of few 'big' sites that keeps it simple though, so that's why I think it's alright here.

In the event of a US collapse, all of those people are suddenly unemployed.

It snowballs, all of those people are no longer productive, they no longer have an income.  A small percentage can be absorbed back into other sectors, but the rest will be a burden on their families, the state, etc.  

How do you solve that problem?  Does the state continue feeding/sheltering them for free?  That'll bankrupt the state.  Do they just let those people die of starvation in the streets?  They'll riot/revolt before they starve to death.  The state collapses either way.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","As a stereoblind person, I can tell you that you can get by fine without stereo depth perception. Basically, I can only see out of one eye at a time, but I have no issues judging depth. This is because the brain is clever enough to see depth a few ways:

- It can watch how the object moves as you move your eyes/head
- It can judge based what you remember of the size of the object or objects near it
- It can look at how objects block each other or are lit
- It can see what lens position you need in your eye to focus on the object

And much more. Stereopsis (stereo depth perception) is just one way for the brain to figure out how far away something is.

The other possibility is that, like many people, you're stereoblind yourself and just haven't realized. You can take a test for that here: http://www.stereoscopynews.com/hotnews/3d-technology/physiological-effects/2275-are-you-stereo-blind.html","1367367294"

Having said that, anyone who knows Rafael Nadal knows he wasn't 100% in that tournament nor was he 100% in Barcelona more recently. That's just the cold hard truth. His backhand has been a detriment rather than a weapon and his speed hasn't been what it was. Because of that Djokovic caught him ""cheating"" a step or two multiples times in that match trying to make up for the step he had lost. 

Now I'm not saying Nadal has played bad. He's played great. But he hasn't played as well as Rafa Nadal can play on clay. 

It's clear you're a Djokovic fan but you're very very wrong to think Nadal was 100% Monte Carlo. As I mentioned, he's on record as saying the exact opposite. ","1367367308"

You can do this yourself by pushing the clavicle up/down gently at the points where it connects with the sternum and scapula. The upper portion of pectoralis major attaches to the clavicle, maybe pec stretching (and scapular retractor strengthening) could help alleviate some of your symptoms.

After the second trimester, it should ONLY be done to save the mother's life, and preferably the child would be delivered by Caesarian section and saved, even if premature.

In fact, pretty much everything in the study that website cites shows that small minorities approve of ""attacks on civilians in the U.S."", ranging from 4-8% in countries surveyed.

"TrueAskReddit","t5_2s91q","I'm not an analyst of any sort and have never worked for a government agency other than the military *however*, I am in the military and occasionally interact with these types.

From what I know and have seen I would say the military, specifically the Special Operations Community is going to be *one of*, if not *the* best places to begin this sort of career.

It's my understanding that any sort of ""Cool Guy Community"", some paramilitary organizations, most of the three letter government agencies, agencies doing off the books work, etc, is going to pull from and heavily favor the military. 

There's any number of analyst positions in the military, and those positions are of an even higher importance inside the military as analyst are the guys who provide the information that the direct action guys need to have to find and kill/capture the ""bad guy"". You can do a quick google search on Military Occupational Specialties, MOS, in the intelligence field to get an idea of some of the jobs I'm talking about.

Another route is college. There are military centric universities that offer degrees in the intelligence field, specifically for jobs that I mentioned and that you're asking about. 

Though these organizations may *seem* to be ultra secret and air tight, but most of them seem to have an initial, cursory application process similar to run of the mill civilian jobs, so if you had relevant experience it's no big deal to go to a website and send a resume and wait for a response.

Also, to the best of my knowledge, jobs like what you're asking about seem to want a great deal of work experience, a Masters in the field, or 10+ years military experience for instance.

That's very debatable though, the ending is really ambiguous when it comes to WTH happen concerning Elizabeth and Booker.

For the other, they are wearing blue-grey colored shirts that aren't part of military uniform but are worn by police instead. K on their shoulder patches does indeed make them cadets. 
 
It is common for women to serve in the various branches of the Ministry of Internal Affairs (police and other civilian executive agencies), and it can be a good career that many women are attracted to. So I think they are police cadets or similar.

EDIT: I think they are from Belarus, actually. Russia got rid of most of their star symbols after the Soviet Union fell apart, and replaced them with symbols in the style of the Imperial Russia. Belarus kept the stars and more of its Soviet legacy. You can see prominent stars on the girls' hats. Also the girls and most of the people in the picture closely conform to the Eastern Slavic phenotype of people with dark blond hair and grey eyes that's very homogeneous in Belarus.

"E_Cigarette","t5_2u9gi","&gt;Like I said before, the only restrictions he's placed on the sub are that the vape mail pictures of common items be relegated to the DVM thread. It was drowning out the other content. Letting everyone post anything works fine when you have smaller subscriber numbers, but once you get to a certain number, you have to implement some rules or it becomes an unorganized mess. It's perfectly fine for me to post every freebie offer I find on /r/freebies and enjoy the karma, but if that offer has already been posted 20 times, it would probably get removed. Now it's the same on the ecr in that if an item has been posted about so many times that it's no longer new and interesting, it should go in the DVM post.

It's more so that, whether he meant to or not, he came across as very anti-newbie. But judging by the responses he gave, it wasn't an accident. And unlike /r/freebies, there are people attached to these postings that are overcoming their own obstacles and have their own personal triumphs. Despite that, it's ""drowning out the important content"" (Read: stuff at my level that I want to see,) so newbies are relegated to the corner. And that doesn't sit well with me. I don't think people are posting simply to reap the karma, I think they're posting because they're excited about quitting smoking - something that should be fostered and not thought of, or treated like, a hinderance. 

&gt;It just felt to me like it was being implied that ecr is much more restrictive than it actually is, and I wanted to clarify. From the sound of it, the restrictions you were talking about are of the ECF variety if I understood you correctly.

In order for such an 'arcology' to exist, it must be able to produce all the things it demands - not just food and water, but also materials such as lumber and steel, power (which must be fueled somehow) as well as luxury items to keep people sane.

Given that resources are distributed scarcely and unevenly over the Earth, metropolitan and regional economies almost by definition produce varying baskets of goods. This is why we have global transportation systems - so that we can trade with parts of the world that make the things that we want or need.

Simpler economies can be self-sustaining on a local basis, but those tend to occur in remote areas that are sparsely populated and not very well developed (think subsistance farming and hunter-gatherer societies.)","1367367331"

"occupywallstreet","t5_2sn7r","You had asked if all the employees were paid equally at the company my family owned and if they weren't then my family was enslaving them?

Since you believe everyone should be paid the same how does that work? We had different people who had different responsibilities so they should be compensated differently, right? Are you saying they shouldn't? They should be paid equally?

Or better yet, so I can hopefully understand your thinking, explain to me how you would decide who gets paid what. Lets say you have 10 employees with 5 different responsibilities. Their ages range from 16-30, and for the sake of argument assume the younger employees have the least experience and the older employees have the most experience. And all  started their jobs at the age of 16 and have worked at the same place the entire time they had a job. 

Except for the fact the 16 year old has a high level of experience and work ethic and the 30 year old has a low level of experience and work ethic. 

Here's the breakdown of the ages and they're group by responsibility. Each individual in each pair have the same responsibility but the complexity of each pair's responsibility varies for the industry their in. 

16 &amp; 30. Complexity scale 10 of 10,  opposite work ethic. (Industry average salary per hour $15.75)

18 &amp; 28. Complexity scale 6 of 10, same good work ethic. (Industry average salary per hour $12.75)

20 &amp; 26. Complexity scale 2 of 10, same poor work ethic. (Industry average salary per hour $8.75)

22 &amp; 24. Complexity scale 4 of 10, one poor, one good work ethic.  (Industry average salary per hour $10.75)

24 &amp; 24. Complexity scale 7 of 10, one poor, one great work ethic. (Industry average salary per hour $13.75)

I am really interested in how you would break this down and figure salaries for each employee.  If there is any other information that would help you make an educated decision let me know and I'll fill in any missing information. The reason I created this scenario is because it closely mimics my parents company. We had five departments and two team members working each department. ","1367367331"

The majority of the articles now are about CM Punk coming back like Jesus or Voltron.  I agree with the sentiment of these articles, but I can't really stand to read them.

The articles that intrigue me the most are usually about Daniel Bryan, Sandow, Rhodes, Cesaro, Barrett and all of the other guys who have the majority of the talent in the company.

I never said this or implied this. My dad was born a Mormon.

I don't think it's insincere. I just think that he is letting the church off too easy.

Anyway, the price just went up to $180 on amazon, which I think is quite steep.  I got it for $150 last week, at which price it was worth it.  Its distortion is extremely low, 1/2 that of Modi...  It outputs much higher power current, 2.25V vs 1.5V...  For that, it would be better with hungrier cans, I would think...

The MSII's enclosure isolates a whole shitload, it's not going to pick up EMI.  In fact, I can hardly hear noise cranking my 17ohm/117dB sensitivity IEMs to max through the O2.  At 3oclock, it's essentially silent, and 3 oclock is farther than you'll need to go to drive almost anything.

Continuing education for pilots begins with IFS, a ""weed out"" flight class for a few months in Colorado.  After passing this, we move on to Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) which lasts approximately a year.  We start in the T-6 Texan II, and then split to either the T-38 or the T-1.  After 6 months in each aircraft we graduate, get our wings, and are assigned to our next aircraft.  In my case, the KC-10.

We don't get advisories per se of recent crashes.  When something like this happens, it of course gets acknowledged by most.  Once the safety investigation comes back, it will be covered in our simulators or briefings.  If it's determined that it is something that ""could"" happen to us, we may practice such things in the simulator.  For example, in the coming months or year, whenever the board comes back, we may have a ""drastic shift in center of gravity"" in our simulator and see what, if anything, we can do to recover from the problem.

We are not required any certain number of hours per month or year to maintain currency.  What we do have is certain events we have to accomplish.  They all have different intervals.  For example, I have to get at least a takeoff, instrument approach, and landing a month.  I have to act as the receiver and ""get a plug"" from another tanker once every 45 days, I have to do 3 formation flights per half year and at least one each quarter, etc.  There are entire publications dedicated to outlining this for everyone.","1367367343"

"bodybuilding","t5_2ql8s","My first recommendation would be to familiarise yourself with your college's   databases. They should be able to provide you with access to numerous relevant journals and other resources. I hope that didn't come across condescending, as that's definitely not my intention. As someone at university, learning how to navigate and narrow down searches for relevant scholarly material is a crucial skill. I encourage you to take the time and develop it as it will greatly benefit your studies.

As mentioned by others in this thread, bodybuilders and bodybuilding are seldom studied. And when they are, it's often regarding gender constructions, identities and other psychological/sociological stuff. You mentioned muscle dysmorphia: you should be able to find some articles through google scholar, but most might be outdated. Harrison Pope is a researcher who has written books on the topic of the ""Adonis Complex"", as well as studied the effects of steroids on men.

My understanding is that Layne Norton does research in the area of bodybuilding nutrition. You can check out his youtube channel [here.](https://www.youtube.com/user/biolayne)

Some other ""science motherfuckers"", as they're known in the fitness community are [IceCreamFitness](https://www.youtube.com/user/IceCreamFitness/featured) and [LiftingForLife.](https://www.youtube.com/user/LiftingForLife) These channels are maintained by Jason Blaha and Ian McCarthy respectively, both somewhat controversial figures in the fitness community. 

I'm not necessarily vouching for the veracity of any of their claims, but they often mention studies in their videos, and sometimes link to them. You could try getting in touch with them and asking where they find their sources, then review their sources for accuracy.

If you're interested in the effects of cardio on ""gainz"", then this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9olhU-h2Jc) might be of interest. Included in the description is a link to an interview with the guy who conducted the study.

I've rambled quite a lot, but I hope something in here helps you. Good luck with your paper!

"history","t5_2qh53","The mindset of the common german person at the time was heavily influenced by the difficult years following the war. Essentially, it was believed that the Weimar government betrayed the german people by agreeing to the harsh terms of the Treaty of Versaille when Entente forces hadn't even entered the German Empire. 

So as you can see, the german people had an ingrained distrust for the Republic. However, that did not make Hitler's ascent to power any easier. Hitler managed to gain votes by appealing to common german sentiments at the time. He promised to return Germany to its former glory, fix the economy and restore social order which.The NSDAP gained a majority during the Reichstag elections of July, 1932. However, by the November elections support for the Party had plummeted. Most likely the votes the NSDAP received in July were in protest to the political deadlock that existed in the country at the time.

On the 27th of Feburary 1933 the Reichstag was set on fire. Hitler used this opportunity to pass the Enabling Act which suspended civil liberties, the goverments of the various states of the Republic and centralized power to him. Keep in mind that the NSDAP was just another nationalistic party at the time. The german people did not have the benefit of hindsight like we do. Also, the situation of Germany at the time was quite dire and, as I've mentioned before, the votes the Party received were most likely in protest to what was happening. Hitler wasn't elected democratically, he was appointed by Hindenburg who thought he could control him. Obviously he was wrong but at the time who would've thought Hitler and his party would end up committing the atrocities they did.

Contrary to popular conception, Hitler wasn't elected democratically and whilst the regime went on to become quite popular with the german people that was because of the extensive use of propaganda. Calling Germany the first victim of the Nazis sounds very poetic and such but I do not believe it accurately represents the complexities of the situation at hand. ","1367367344"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Getting into the habit of saving and not spending every dime you bring in is a great habit to develop early.  However what you earn now won't really have that big of an impact on your future, so set aside some of that cash for college as that's probably about as long-term as you need to be thinking right now.  Perhaps talk with your parents about plans for paying for college.  If they are going to pay for you save it for a bit of spending money.  If they cannot pay for your college your small savings really won't make that big of a dent in tuition so it's better to focus on doing things that could help you earn scholarships such as getting good grades,being involved in your community, and charitable work.

Also, let's not kid ourselves here.  OP is 14 and will definitely be thinking car in about two years.  Lots of teens save up for cars.  They're all money pits but for kids they offer a sense of freedom that most of us quickly forget about.  Not the worst way for a teen to learn some personal responsibility.

Lastly bitcoin is really more of a gamble rather than an investment.  It's user base consists of illicit drug buyers, a few criminal organizations, tin-foil hat types, and folks looking to take advantage of short term value swings.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","One major achievement was the development of Russell's theory of descriptions in the last century. Russell came up with a way of analyzing the english sentence:

""The dog is red"" 

as:

There exists a unique entity x such that x is a dog and x is red. 

This formalization is helpful because it allows us to deal with sentences like:

The present king of france is bald. 

If the sentence is false in ordinary english, it means that the present king of france isn't bald, which means there is a present king of france. Russell cleared the issue with his formalization since he interpreted the sentence as false in a way that fits our intuitions better, by putting the negation on the existential quantifier:

It is not true that there is a unique x such that x is the present king of france and x is false. 

Another achievement of this century in philosophy was a solution to the problem of induction due to Armstrong. The best explanation of regularities in the world is the existence of *necessities*. But necessities hold across all times. So *natural laws*, e.g. physical necessities, are what cause induction to be valid. We will always accelerate towards larger masses than us because that is entailed by a *necessary truth*, not just a temporary truth as in humeanism about natural laws. 

These are just two examples. You should specify whether you're looking for some specific area. There have been many huge results in contemporary philosophy (partly due to the professionalization of philosophy leading to many new geniuses working on problems). ","1367367345"

&gt;high rate of fire

Pick one. Semi-automatic means that it can only fire as fast as you can pull the trigger. An AR-15 has the same rate of fire as this [Remington 742](http://www.huntingnet.com/forum/upfiles/93251/B9CA7F63115E48D2AC781DE55F9A11F4.jpg) and you know what?

&gt;An AR-15 is an example. Useless for hunting

Christ. [The AR-15 platform is perfectly suitable for hunting](https://www.google.com/search?q=hunting+with+an+ar+15&amp;safe=off&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=nVyAUfrgBpTS8wTM2IDYCA&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE8QsAQ&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=600). It's good for boar, deer, coyotes and other varmints. 

&gt; terrible for self defense

That's also false. For home defense there is NO better firearm. Shotguns will penetrate too much and go through walls, potentially injuring people on the other side. They are also often heavy and have stout recoil, two things you dont want to have to deal with if you are a small framed person. Pistols arent much better. They generally have worse accuracy and are harder to control given that you only have one point of contact on the gun, whereas you have two on an AR, and they still have the problem with overpenetration, projecting a fat bullet slowly that likes to go through walls

The .223/5.56 round is extremely good for home defense. As it is a small, fast round, it tends to tumble when it hits something. That means very little chance at over penetration and a higher chance at stopping whatever threat is in your home. ","1367367347"

You might be able to fix #1 with cameras to record everything that happens in the vehicle, and then charge the customer for any damage they cause or mess they leave behind, but then that conflicts somewhat with #2.

Your colors are flat. An entire continent will not have the same shade of green grass across it. Vary the colors, use artistic license. Same goes for the water. Make it lighter around the shores, throw in some really light to show a shallow, warmer, more tropical shoreline in places. And get more colors for trees.

Your texture could use a lot of work. It looks to me, in these pictures, to just be built up globs of acrylic (or oil?) paint. Be more refined. 

It overall looks too flat. There are some mountains, but it really just looks pretty flat with a steep drop-off to the water all around. Be more nuanced with the topography.

And the castles, as was mentioned, could be improved. Take some courses/read some books in making miniatures. It takes a lot of time but, damn, if it's done well it's so impressive.

Basically, yeah, I think some people would pay a lot of money for something like this. But you need to put days or weeks into it, not 12 hours.

Great work! Really impressive. If you really want to keep doing this, you're off to a fantastic start and show a lot of talent.

EDIT: I retract my comment about texture for the water and waves. They look great in the pictures! But wave action only really occurs near the shoreline. Having comparatively tsunami-looking wave action in the middle of the ocean looks weird.","1367367353"

There are several teas that are often marketed as ""weight loss accelerators,"" Green tea being the most common for this in the United States. Chinese holistic medicine has claimed for centuries that Pu-er tea (a resteepable tea that is fermented, pressed into discs, dried and aged) helps you loose weight and cleanses your digestive system. 

There is no science to back this up, however for me (I drink a lot of tea, everyday) I feel that since upping my tea intake my digestive system runs a bit more smoothly. 

Bottom line, I wouldn't turn to a tea or any product that contains tea and claims it will help you loose weight. But drinking tea is awesome, calorie free and certainly won't deter your efforts. ","1367367353"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","WEP is a statistical attack, not brute force, you collect a bunch of packets from the router and use them to figure out the key.

The only time consuming thing about WEP is collecting the packets, but if you have a card that supports injection you can force the router to send a ton of packets instead of relying on activity from the users. With a good signal I can have a WEP key in under 5 minutes.

WPA is always a brute force attack and takes forever even with a lot of computing power and rainbow tables, assuming it is actually in the dictionary list used to create the rainbow tables.

WPA with WPS is also a brute force attack, using a vulnerability that allows the router to give up all information if you give it the correct 8 digit number. At 8 digits 0-9 there are 100,000,000 combinations, but the 8th is a checksum, 10,000,000 combinations. It gets better, if you get the first 4 digits correct it will tell you, 10,000 combinations for the first 4, then just another 1,000 needed for the last 3. So in 11,000 tries or less you are into a WPA protected router no matter how long the actual key is, easily done in an afternoon.","1367367353"

"amateurradio","t5_2qi86","It's difficult to say from the description. A diagram might help me see specific issues, but it could be interactions between the antennas, or ground issues, or improper tuning. The ground you describe there sounds a little sketchy, especially for the HF antenna, and while UHF and VHF antennas frequently are sort of OK without a good ground, if they aren't ok, they're often REALLY not ok. They're very good at turning the coax in to an antenna. If I'm reading this right, they set it up using the coax shield as the only ground for both antennas, then grounding the shield at the pass through? If so, that needs to be remedied. Not only is it terrible for antenna performance (any antenna that claims it needs no ground is what we refer to as a 'dummy load'. Used by dummies) It is also a serious safety issue. Especially on the HF antenna, that mast needs to be grounded. One lightning strike, and all his equipment is going to turn in to a hell of a fireworks display, and potentially burn down the house, or kill the operator sitting at the radio.

Other issues could just be tuning (my first guess), a bad chunk of feedline, a dodgy connector, corrosion on the connectors, there are a lot of things that can make specific band segments sketchy. It's very possible the HF antenna is pissing off the VHF/UHF antenna, but it's less likely that it's going the other direction. The VHF/UHF antenna isn't likely to be electrically long enough to become a parasitic component of the HF antenna *unless* something is really wrong with how the ground is done, and the coax runs are entering in to the equation.

The HF SWR could be screwy on some bands because those multiband verticals can be **VERY** sensitive to tuning issues, and no two ever tune up exactly the same way. Frequently, the same antenna won't tune the same way if you take it down and put it back up somewhere else. Did anybody actually tune it before they put it up, or did they just assemble it per the manual and throw it up on the mast? If they didn't tune it at all, or just spitballed it, you may have to take it down, do a rough tuning on the ground with the analyzer, put it back up, and fine tune it on the mast. Elevation matters on these antennas.

The VHF/UHF antenna could have the same issue, but I'm not familiar with how, or if it's even possible, to tune that X30A. The manual should cover it though.

"SuicideWatch","t5_2qpzs","If it helps I can share with you my current passion which is horology (watchmaking and time pieces).

Here's a straightforward video that can give you a basic understanding of how the average wrist watch works. It's a lot more straightforward than most people think. Merchanical watches haven't changed all that much since the 1850s or so..

[http://youtu.be/TQd-0YXqmR0](http://youtu.be/TQd-0YXqmR0)

Neil Armstrong was sent into space with this Omega watch ;

[http://theversatilegent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Armstrong-Collins-Speedmaster.jpeg](http://theversatilegent.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Armstrong-Collins-Speedmaster.jpeg)

A few years ago they dug up a Bulova watch from the sea, it was still ticking 67 years later when they
gave it back to the owner, aged 90 at the time.. who might now be dead, yet that watch it still ticking.

[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1025033/Watch-thats-seabed--And-working-67-years.html](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1025033/Watch-thats-seabed--And-working-67-years.html)

I think what I find most comforting about horology is that a man can put together something from scratch that doesn't require electricity, people or anything outside itself to keep working. Who knows how long these watches may keep ticking for in the right circumstances.

Imagine launching an automatic watch into space that you made, floating through the never ending void in never ending motion, winding itself. A piece of you ticking away for who knows how long.. aeons of years potentially, perhaps forever.

All it takes to put one together is a toolkit you can buy on amazon for nothing, once all parts are assembled you can put your own personal stamp on it.. even if it's just your name laser engraved on the back.

It's been a while since I've read the history of how currency used to work but until relatively recently in history, they really were more like a real note, because you could present the note and they had to give you a certain amount I believe of gold in exchange.  It really was a debt!  But they did away with that at some point.

The car was so accommodating and sharp for the time it was released. Oh and the turning radius of the wagons is stunning, by no means a clunky boat.

I really don't mean to sound like a snob, but I feel that people who've never sat behind a pre-2000s(or even 90s) Volvo won't really understand why cars like the 240 were so solid. It's something that needs to be experienced for oneself.

You didn't say where your sword was; I assumed he was in a position [like the man on the left](http://www.knife-depot.com/images/articles/sword-fighting.jpg) in the first attack you cited, (because you didn't specify and that's kind of the ""default"" sword-fighting pose) and [like this](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs30/f/2008/142/2/5/Chibi_swordsman_by_Daggerfell.jpg) in the second (because you mentioned repeatedly that he's relaxed, he seems somewhat arrogant, and he just took a moment to teach) which would leave the bottom of his ribs vulnerable in the last two attacks you cited.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Yes, I also smoke and drive. I never, ever drink and drive. Why? Because I know how each affects me, and one is unsafe and the other is not.

Most of the people saying ""you can't drive while stoned"" have little experience being stoned, and thus have a low tolerance. I can't remember the last time pot made me nervous, anxious, or in any way impaired.

It's not a drug of impairment; it's a drug that alters perception. In my case, it doesn't alter it in a way that affects my reflexes or coordination; it doesn't cause me hallucinations; it doesn't do anything that would prevent me from driving a car.

I don't smoke when I'm working, as I prefer to relax and focus on arts, music, making, etc., and also relaxation. I have a high tolerance for pretty much any drug, and smoking, drinking, and everything else you ingest affects everyone differently.

The funny thing is, alcohol is legal and pot is not. That's the greatest travesty right there; criminalizing alcohol use and decriminalizing pot would probably result in the same amount of impaired drivers, but I'd bet my house that the number of DUI accidents and arrests would drop significantly.

TL;DR: there are worse evils than pot (alcohol) and just because you react a certain way to a drug, doesn't mean it's that way for everyone.

"halo","t5_2qixk","I don't consider a map average, but unique to Halo 4 and its gameplay settings. Therefore, I can't know what you mean by ""average"".

I look at its layouts, take into consideration the weapon combinations someone might have, and exercise what my possibilities are based on my loadout. For example, I'm not going to walk on open center bridge on Meltdown with an AR and expect to live just like rushing sword off spawn on Haven when the entire enemy team tosses grenades at that area and I'm in there. Why? Besides the obvious, the fact my loadout is ineffective in that situation outside of me being a Halo god and the other shooter(s) sucking something nasty, there's too many vantage points to cover and further be aware about. The same concept applies to any competitive BR person who wants to cover two or three points and not have any more.

BR users in the past, dislike the notion of having to cover more openings and points only to find distance becomes a factor like you just said. Distance is not the enemy with a lot of BR users because in the end, if you are engaging someone at distance, with a friendly in nearby parameters, you can generally get the assist/kill. The DMR, only makes long ranges more accurate based and easier for a DMR person to kill a BR user who didn't stay to within the max distance for its firing range.

While I like the notion of increasing the distance challenge among BR users, the fact stands that is why the DMR was implemented. Maps got bigger and bigger (even the small arena ones are nowhere near the original sizes of CE and H2 outside of some DLC ones, and even those are elongated to still have a distance window for DMR people like Skyline's no cover between bottom mid Sticky Det spawn and the top of the stairs to flag stand), a BR user could kill in those situations, but the DMR range makes it a more multi-threat then the BR in that situation.

Besides that, the distance issue is not found in the DMR functionality. It was supposed to work over distance and medium to long range for a reason. Halo 3 and even some instances of Halo 2 featured too many issues among BR users over distance and while that increases the skill gap, it isn't user friendly, something all developers try to steer away from for a reason. You spend A LOT of time trying to make weapon gameplay suitable for situations on a map and rarely is there an instance where a single gun is going to perform on all aspects of a map. The DMR is no exception to that, though it is pushing that all too familiar ""Too easy in a lot of situations, on almost all the maps, for someone with good thumb work to pull kills easier then any other kind of gun, including the LR scoped). But that is a power for a developer, not for players to determine.","1367367369"

"RandomActsOfPizza","t5_2sle9","I once had a job as a pizza delivery guy and had to do the last run of the night - but because it's the last one right at closing I have to take an annoying coworker of mine with me (he lives near my house).

I've never done deliveries with someone else, so I didn't know what to expect (I don't really talk to this guy, y'know?). I like peace and quiet, which is a perk to the job I enjoy - but this coworker isn't a delivery guy, he just works in the restaurant (and for whatever reason) is really excited to do this with me to the point where he's backseat driving THE WHOLE FUCKING TIME. I nearly snap - but before I fly off the handle I take a breath and said ""Fuck it, you can drive.""

Big mistake. Big. Fucking. Mistake.

Holy shit this guy ruins my car so bad - tires get completely FUCKED because he can't stay on the road - by the time I have him stop the car it's too late - can't even fucking drive it anymore. Thing won't start - so we lose the car. The one thing I needed for my job, gone.

Now keep in mind my car doesn't have GPS and my fuck-face coworker doesn't have a map / phone / anything to help the situation. I'm pissed. Can't contact the restaurant - it's closed anyways. We have to walk this pizza the rest of the way. And because he's feeling bad, what great contribution does my coworker have? ""I'll carry the box!""

Usually I'm good with my surroundings, but we're in a part of town I've NEVER been to - it's empty, which makes it really creepy. And I'm dead tired because we've been walking for god knows how long. It's getting late into the night and I'm scared as shit because yup, there's no denying it, we're lost.

By the way - The pizza? Cold as balls by now.

My coworker is trying to play it off as cool - says he knows the way, but I'm not buying it. To tell you the truth, I don't even really like my job, so I figure hey, let's just eat the pizza and go home. But nope, at this point he's too invested in the delivery of this thing - says it'll be totally with it (if people tip that is).

Luckily we finally did find the place - but when we got there, guess what? Out of all the things that could go wrong - We fucked up the guy's order. He said we forget his Diet Dr. Kelp. But at that point I was so pissed I slammed the box in his face and consoled my crying sponge of a coworker. After all this we had just enough time to get back to the Krusty Krab for our next shift.","1367367374"

This. I was talking to a close guy friend the other day (not that this is exclusive to guys at all, just that's who I was talking to) and he was saying how he'd met a girl recently who he actually had a connection with, which he hasn't in years. But he's dated lots of girls in that time and many of them he planned some kind of future with. We were talking about how when you're single, there's this social pressure to find someone, *anyone*. And then once you're seeing ""anyone"" you can't just have it be casual or you're ""wasting time"", it has to be *going somewhere*.

I think that pressure is responsible for a lot of bad relationships. It seemed to be true for him, anyway.

Delegating is fighters only.  You can delegate fighters to someone up to a max of thier drone skills (5)  The drones will follow and are controled by the pilot they are delegated to, the carrier pilot just sits thier twiddling his/her thumb

&gt;To assign fighters to a ship, the ship in question must already have the ability to use drones.

No any ship can get drones, do it all the time to stealth bombers, did it to noctis pre tiericide

cheapest baseline HP and evap coil job would be around $3000 for say a 3 ton.

gimme size/seer/brand and i can ballpark the wholesale cost of the equipment, but that is really meaningless. Labor and overhead account for a sizeable if not most of the cost of a job. The most important thing is getting a flat price incl all tax, fees, permits, etc that the contractor will stick to. ""What the check is written for at the end of the job"". Dont use someone who wont give a firm price. Us good heat and air companies sometimes take a bath on a job because we ran into unforeseen issues.

less than 10 times in my 17 yrs I have raised my price after starting a job. Each of those times I offered to not charge, stop work, remove the equipment, and leave the jobsite as clean as possible after running into a catastrophic problem while the customer got second opinions/prices.


Gross estimate with knowing nothing about the job would be:

Heat Pump $1k - $4k depending on size/efficiency/brand
coil  $200-$500
freon lines? - $400-800 (includes extra labor to do them)

It can be tricky until you get a ""feel"" for how long it takes to run out of Hatred so that you don't have to constantly take your eyes away from the action. You also have to make sure that you re-cast Shadow Power every time your channeling breaks. Once you do it right though you've basically got a perpetual motion machine of hatred versus discipline, and health isn't even an issue because it's always refilling.

I find having a *lot* of crit and discipline helps. With the Stone of Jordan (+6% strafe crit), I'm at 79 disc and it works, but at 69 it doesn't and I run out too fast (if I switch to another DML w/ more dex but no +disc). With a regular ring w/ 4.5% crit, I can get away with 69 discipline, and even down to 49 if I'm parsimonious with it. Maybe it's because Shuriken cloud just doesn't work well enough with that loss of 4.5% crit chance. In all cases my Nat's Cloak has +8% crit strafe, and the discipline requirement is the primary reason that I keep the 4-piece set Nat's bonus for the +20 disc.","1367367377"

Out of all those books, my favorite description thus far has been Snyder's recent one he did near the end of Death of the Family in issue 15.

[First there's the close up of Joker's face as he muses a bit on him](http://i.imgur.com/6Sh7q16.jpg)

[and then as he steps into the manor and thinks again on what he said.](http://i.imgur.com/TArfhcF.jpg)

It's just so haunting to think that after all these years Batman still can't fully comprehend the Joker.  That this man has made himself into something *more* just like Batman, and that through all this insanity, it isn't a desire to see Batman die, but out of *love* that he commits these acts.  

When the Joker is just committing some act of vandalism, I get bored with him, he's in so many of the stories.  But when they really dive into his character, when they remind you why Batman's arguably greatest foe is a freaking clown, those are the stories I really love.","1367367381"

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","You don't owe anyone sex or love. You don't owe anyone any particular quantity of sex or love. It would be pretty awful of a friend or lover to make you feel as though you do.

Your partners are however allowed to be a little jealous or sad or whatever else they feel. It's up to them to handle those emotions in a way that they can live you, and up to you to decide if you're ok with the way they're handling it. Communication about those feelings is on both of you.

Talk about it with the people involved. Keep talking about it until you're ok with wherever it lands. Ignore the third parties and busy bodies who are telling you things about your partners if you've talked to your partners and everything feels right with them.

There's no rule, law, or moral obligation to treat them equally. They aren't children. Sometimes people love each other differently. Every poly dynamic that includes a primary concept somewhere in the relationship model is clear proof of that. Be honest with the people you're involved with and make sure things are going in a way that everyone is ok with. ","1367367384"

"Dogtraining","t5_2r067","Others have offered good advice here, including using [building block behaviours](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/index#wiki_building_block_behaviors) to get and keep his attention. You can also try incorporating a solid U-turn into his walking routine. As Learned_Response mentions, avoidance is really a go-to approach when walking. Not all dogs greet well on leash. In fact, very few are without some form of fearful, angry, or frustrated greeting behaviours, so U-turning, ""[Let's go](http://dogmantics.com/2012/11/17/how-to-stop-lunging-and-barking-train-lets-go-clicker-dog-training-shy-reactive-dogs/)!"", crossing the street, or even changing up where you walk to avoid those houses can be key tools to use on regular walks.

[This article includes a video](https://www.patriciamcconnell.com/theotherendoftheleash/tag/emergency-u-turn) that shows the benefit of training autowatching. [This video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JY7JrteQBOQ) also works on reactivity on leash.

If you want to read something more tangible, check out [BAT](http://functionalrewards.com), which is very effective for leash reactivity, and Feisty Fido is another that many owners benefit from. Our [full recommended book list](http://www.reddit.com/r/Dogtraining/wiki/books) is here.

It's pretty important to catch him before he gets into that frenzied state, so avoiding those houses will help. You can also help yourself out by looping a rubber band or other material around your dog's tags/leash clip so the neighbourhood dogs don't hear him jangling on approach.","1367367384"

I only a few weeks learned about this, but it is an outrage! Wild horses have been a protected animal group since the 70's. The wild horse populations has dropped drastically since then and continues to do so. Despite being ""protected"", they have too little suitable land to allow them to thrive like they use to.

It seems that more and more of the land they require is being taken away. Park and preserve lands are sometimes sold off in hard times, but the presence of a protected species on that land makes it difficult to purchase. 

Wild horses, a symbol of American history and identity, are making it difficult to buy land for strip malls. Coincidentally, these horses are now being rounded up and slaughtered to be sold to the third world. Wtf?

I admit I'd like to do some more research on the topic to better understand what's going on. Does anyone have good info?

And they only work if you have respect for every single person in the room.

When I was an MS3 doing my surgery rotation (when Dinosaurs ruled the earth and well before JCAHO mandated surgical time outs in the US) I netted the 3 worst surgical services for my rotation. The last was with a surgeon who scared the snot out of all of us. His reputation at my school was a total sociopath.

I was in the OR early and watched as the put the patient in position before the surgeon came in. The patient was a dialysis patient and I remembered (from seeing her in clinic) that the surgery was supposed to be the side contralateral to her shunt. As they were getting ready I realized that they were getting ready to do the procedure on the wrong side. My heart was in my throat but I piped up and said in the least brave way you could imagine.... ""um... Dr Sociopath.... I think that's... um... the wrong side.""

Instead of blowing me off he stopped and had the float nurse check the record... and realized he was on the wrong side. He could have told me to fuck off, but he stopped, took me seriously and when he realized I was right said ""Thanks, I owe you one"" and did the surgery on the correct side and we totally went about things as though it never happened - which was seriously fine with me. I think he was slightly less malignant with me than everyone else and it seemed like a fair trade to me.

Then a few weeks after the rotation, I got my grade. Realize that I was miserable the whole time so I know my personal evals we less than stellar. I showed up but I was no gunner. More of a slinker actually. So while I thought I did OK on my exam, I was going to be happy with a pass, and though maybe there was a 5% chance I could squeak out a high pass.

*Fucking Honors, Bitch!*

And his comment made it into my Dean's Letter: “Chairman Sociopath from the department of Surgery credits Bayesianqueer with saving one of his patients by stopping Dr Sociopath who was about to perform the the incorrect procedure on a patient.” The bastard never said a thing to anyone but I credit him with getting me my first choice residency. And I walked in the first day and they thought I had balls as big as church bells.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Re-replying here hoping more people will see it:


Explaining what works for me won't necessarily help you. I'll give you the list of things my SO and I do to make things better. I just want to emphasize that everyone is different and the most important things are:

1 - First and foremost is communication and exploration. I've found that misophonia is different for each person. I urge you to explore exactly what causes you grief. For example, I learned that if I eat the same type of food as my partner I'm a lot less attentive to it. The second part is communication - you need to explain this to your partner. Not just what the problem is but what exactly your triggers are.

2 - Have the right SO. Sorry but this one is out of your control. My soon to be wife is an incredible person. She constantly looks out for my triggers and urges me to feel comfortable. She fosters a safe place for me to be vocal about what I'm going through. She has never once asked me to ""get over it"". Part of coping is figuring out how to deal with your anger too. For all my SO and I try sometimes I still blow my lid - this makes me feel extremely guilty and shameful. My SO always makes me feel better and is very supportive of me even when my frustration was directed at her. Everyday she tries to make it better. Everyday she tries to understand it more. Every. Damn. Day.

3 - Have the right outlook. Learn more about misophonia, explore your triggers, always try new things to help you. You cannot control your misophonia but you can try to not ""activate"" it.

Things to try / Things I do to cope

* If we are doing different things - headphones for me. Either closed ear that blocks noise or noise canceling.
Watching TV together - sometimes we both put on headphones so she can snack.

* Eating together - we started planning snack and meal times to better sync up. My misophonia is easier to manage while I'm eating at the same time. Eating the same type of snack helps too. Crunchy = Crunchy. Sloppy = Sloppy. Slurpy = Slurpy.

* Leaving the room - we've talked about this and have rules on who leaves and when. If I'm playing video games and she's reading - she will leave the room as my activity is dependent on a stationary object (the TV). Other times she leaves when we both could, simply because that is something she does to show how much she cares for me. She says she doesn't mind but I think different.

* Make rules (together) - I mentioned one before but we also have a ""nuclear option"" which I can invoke anytime. If I say the word I can tell her to stop eating and she will. This was her idea so that I always have a safe place to talk about it and so I don't keep the anger inside and really freak out after holding it in.

If you have any questions or ever want to vent feel free to PM me. This goes for ANYONE who reads this post. Not just the person I responded to.

After re-reading this I really need to write a love letter to my wife to be. :)

nár = nach
ar = an
gur = go
níor = ní

In all cases that I've seen, if the verb takes, say, nár instead of nach, then it will also take gur, níor, cár, and ar instead of go, ní, cá and an.

I see a lot of physics to engineer analogies, certainly valid. However, the theory (physics) is as old as thought its self. While the application (engineering) is still several hundred years older than programming. The point is the field has not had the time to even begin to define its self. That is blindingly evident in just the shear scope of tools being used (namely languages, but even beyond them). A mature field has settled on a core set of vernacular, process, etc.

I first submitted this photo [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/photocritique/comments/1dabg8/a_little_high_on_iso/)  I received some tips from /r/photoshop, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/photoshop/comments/1dbsti/a_few_tips_on_reducing_some_of_the_iso_noise_on/) and applied them.   I also received some tips and inspiration from /u/credoincaseum, who did a nice job cleaning it up [here](http://i.imgur.com/HjtePra.jpg).

I think a female on male rape would be either the male being physically held down, or else so physically incapacitated by drugs or something that he was either unable to physically get away, or so out of it that he didn't realise what was going on. So, basically the same as male on female rape. Do you think any of that applies to you, or was it just a bad decision made while drunk?

"sex","t5_2qh3p","I think I told the same thing to someone else a while back: 

Legally - it depends on where you are whether it was rape or not.  In the UK this would 100% not be rape.  In the US it would depend on the state and other factors would come into play (was it accomplished by force?  Did your intoxication negate your ability to consent?)

Socially - it depends on what definition you go by for rape.  You obviously didn't give enthusiastic consent.  You were obviously very drunk but sober enough to say you didn't want to.  

If the genders were reversed it would almost certainly be rape legally and socially.  

But in the end does it really matter what you call it?  I mean, that only matters if you want to press charges, (or rather inform the police) imo.  If you want to do that you're well within your rights.  If you feel you were violated you were violated.  Who cares whether the government or anyone else would classify this as ""rape"" or not?  If it's bothered you, perhaps see a counselor about it.  

Best of luck to you.  (P.S. no you did not consent) ","1367367411"

The harasser fills the role of a light, ground based fast attack unit, that honestly, the flash did not preform well. 

Here is what the flash can do:

1. Cheap transport, both in resources and the low cooldown timer.

2. Stealthy Assault. Wraith module and a small profile allow it to sneak into unexpected places that a harasser could not. A heavy assault on the back can also turn it into a highly mobile rocket launcher platform that can show up nearly anywhere.

3. Scouting unit: The flash has access to the scout radar, which the harasser does not. An upgraded scout flash can cover an entire small base with radar. Incredibly useful.","1367367411"

3) Aang vs Korra. As a person, I go Aang but this is his downfall in a fight. Aang is a lover and not a fighter. Korra has that killer instinct that Aang so rarely unleashes. Assuming neither can go avatar state, Korra has got this. 

4) Asami wins. Sokka isn't actually that good a fighter plus Asami has been trained in martial arts since she was a child. 

5) When two bloodbenders meet, the better one wins. Its a toss up because we don't actually figure out who is a better bloodbender. Probably Tarlock so yeah, Tarlock.","1367367415"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree on most default subreddits this is how the feature is used, understandably too, since Reddit's target demographic has changed drastically since its creation. However, strides to at least curb comments seeking karma have had wonderful success on larger subreddits, namely /r/games and /r/askreddit. I think this is another stride in the right direction. 

I think the idea of being able to filter out irrelevant comments and move to the top comments that contribute to the conversation is a great forum for active discussion. Often on normal BBS forums I see a really good opening post, then 2 or 3 pages of mindless posts before I see another in depth contributing one. Even on large subreddits that put forth the effort to keep comments in check (See again /r/games and /r/askreddit, though more the former than the latter) this discussion is able to be kept somewhat in check. Certainly trends and hivemind opinions come out, but I've not seen any forum for discussion which actually alleviates this. Even on BBS forums, where the only sorting algorithm is the time which a post is made, users with drastically differing opinions than the majority are harassed and ridiculed until they leave the forum.","1367367415"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","Of course I do. The common misconception about the Islanders is that it's the New York John Tavares'. They're not. Within the past month or two, the team has settled down and has been playing as a solid unit - we might not have the depth that the Penguins have in celebrated scorers, but we certainly DO have depth, and we've been getting production from all four lines.

We can score, and we can play solid, defense oriented shut down hockey. So, if Nabby plays like he's been playing, (off the top of my head - 1.80 or so gaa in the last month), and the defense plays well positioned hockey, there's no doubt in my mind that the Isles can take the series in six.

Now i'm not saying the Pens will just roll over and let us win, i'm saying that the hype surrounding the series is really focused on the Penguins alone, which could really go in our favor.

Here's to a good series! The first i've seen my team play in six years.

So, it's quite simple really.  Just never end your turn where the AI can see you, and NEVER use your last movement point to advance.  

If you end your turn, and you can't see anything that can't see you.  Your sub will likely live.  I think this is because the AI is so bad at combat,  I think the AI must ""see"" everything at once, and then plan all it's moves, and then executes.  I don't think it moves one unit at a time and then re evaluates the new information.  I swear i've been in situations where my sub has been swarmed in one turn by enemy ships, yet wasnt' fired upon.

* I try to avoid the sun.
* I try to avoid my sun.
* I try to avoid that sun.

Which would be correct? The first, obviously; the scope is such that only one sun is there, so you can refer to it from an overarching scope.  If you couldn't tell, each of these relates to a different way they can have a reference to an object in the code.

* I try to avoid the sun.

    class Person {
       public void avoidSun() {
          moveAwayFrom(Sun.position);
       }
       public void moveAwayFrom() { ... }

* I try to avoid my sun.

    class Person {

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Could be interesting for WAYWT and the Fit Check/Feedback thread. 

The positives of using this new feature in the WAYWT would be that users wouldn't be influenced by the upvote/downvotes in deciding what they like about a fit. It would encourage users to judge a fit for themselves and not just immediately agree that a fit is ""good"" because the OP has a CC tag next to their name. Feedback would also become more ""raw"", advice and criticism won't be objectively deemed ""right"" or ""wrong"" based on its score, all feedback can be taken with a grain of salt and users will need to think for themselves to make their own personal decision.  I think that this could help new users learn what they like for their personal style instead of being influenced by possible hype. 

On the negative spectrum, we would have to trust people to give good advice and not try to lead people wrong by giving them shit advice because the score is hidden. 

Overall my opinion is that MFA doesn't really need this. But it could be an interesting experiment.

But its probably easier just to put their pictures over the closest matching power.


Some examples:

**Hypnotoad**

Defense Only - Alliance and Planning

You have the power to BRRRRREEEAW.  At the start of the Alliance phase, use this power to skip inviting players, and instead you choose which side the players ally with and how many ships they are to send as long as it does not cause them to completely remove all ships from a planet.  

During the Planning phase, you tell the offense what card they must try to play, either a Negotiate or an Attack Card of a number higher or lower of your choosing.  If the encounter card you told them to play is not in their hand, they can play any encounter card.


**Amazonians**

Main Player Only - Resolution

You have the power of Snu-Snu.   If you win the encounter, use this power to take a random card from your opponent for each ship you sent in the encounter, up to a maximum of 4 cards.


**Popplers (young Omicronians)**

Any player - any phase

You have the power to be eaten.  Whenever you lose a ship to the warp, use this power put that ship under another player's single ship in the warp if possible.  Only one of your ships can be placed under another ship in this manner.  

If a player has to free a ship from the warp, you may use this power to force them to return a ship that has one of your ships under it.  Your ship also gets returned.  If this is the first time this encounter a ship of yours has been freed, you may also draw a card.

**Globetrotters**

Main Player Only - Reveal 

You have the power of Mathketball.  When encounter cards are revealed and if both cards are Attack cards, use this power to take two tokens.  Lay one token flat away from the warp, at minimum the hyperspace gate's distance.  You will then the other token to push down on the edge of the token on the table until it gets into the air or moves.  If it lands anywhere touching the warp, you may immediately either double your attack card or half your opponents attack card.

**Neutrals**

Not Main Player

You have the power of Neutrality.  During the Alliance phase, you can not join either side, even if you were invited.  Instead, you may use your power to offer a card to both the offense and the defense.  They look at the card secretly and tell you if they will keep it or return it to you.   

If the offense took the card and won the encounter, you may put one to four ships on that planet to establish a colony.  

If the defense took the card and won the encounter, you may draw 2 cards or free 2 ships from the warp.

If both main players successfully made a deal, you get the above for the player that took your card (both if both players accepted your card).

**Neptunians**

Any player - Mandatory

You have the power of hands.  You start the game with four hands of 2 cards instead of 8 cards.  Whenever you draw a card or an ability involves your hand, use this power to instead choose which hand the card will go in or ability will affect.  This can include one of your hands that has no cards in it.  If this power is zapped, the player who zapped your power chooses which hand instead.

At the start of your turn or at the start of the planning phase on defense, if you have no encounter cards in any of your hands, discard all of your cards and draw four more hands of 2 cards each again.  Otherwise, at the start of your turn, you may use this power to discard a hand that has no encounter cards and draw two more encounter cards into that hand.

**The Space Pope**

Main Player - Planning

You have the power of confession.  When an opponent lays down an encounter card, use this power to force them to tell you what the encounter card is (negotiate or the number of the attack).  If during the reveal phase the opponent did not reveal what they said, this must seek penance by losing 4 ships to the warp of their choice from any of their colonies.

Do Not use with Oracle or Gambler


**Yivo**

Any player

You have the power of tentacles.  Each time a player loses one ore more ships to the warp, you may put a token on one of their planets.  If you have at least one token on all of another player's planets, use this power to immediately remove all the tokens and establish a colony by putting one of your ships on one of their planets of your choice.","1367367430"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Was this a really old machine? Before the machines became computerized like they are now, the reels had to lock in to place. If they were 1mm away from locking in, they didn't lock in.  I believe they worked [similarly to a combination lock](http://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/household-safety/security/inside-lock.htm). Using the combination lock example, the correct code was 23-45-10, and this was a real picky lock that required you to be exact. Unfortunately, the lock didn't open because the entered code was 24-45-10.

The old machines that used this style were like this because it was harder to really guarantee that the casino was going to make money off of them, so the top wins had really small ""lock in"" holes.

Today, every machine, even the ones with physical reels, are computerized and you won't get this kind of situation. I write the code for these slot machines, and I can explain more about how the percentages and stuff work if anyone is interested. Long story short, you have a better chance at winning on the new computerized machines, but the casino knows that over a very long period of time, they will always come out on top. ","1367367433"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","1. Howard is the best C in a league without many serviceable C's. Even if he only puts up numbers like he did this season with the Lakers, his defensive presence still makes up for any offensive shortcomings he may have coming off injury. But he's a locker room changer, and more than that he is a court changer. On paper he's a good fit, but I don't think Houston needs him.

2. Asik would have to be traded if Howard is signed. It would be a bad move on Houston's part because even if Howard pans out, Asik is younger and has a cheaper contract. I think Asik does a lot of things Howard does but he works within the Houston system and knows his place. He's busy earning his keep in this league like everyone else in Houston. He fits. Howard doesn't.

3. PBev is a great bench sparkplug, but he isn't a starting point guard anywhere in this league except maybe Indiana, where he fits rather well. Beverly's greatest asset is his confidence, which Lin is lacking. Lin is a playmaker. His passing is great, and he is unselfish. He's becoming very, very good. It would be a mistake to trade him. Lin and Beverly play well on the court together. Perhaps better than Harden and Lin do. Right now Lin's numbers aren't as good as they would be if he were utilized different. But the truth is that forcing Lin to play outside his comfort zone has made him a better player than he would be normally. Anyone who's watched Lin's jumpshot over the course of this season can testify to that.","1367367438"

I can't count how many races I lost last lap because I bit a curb and the wheel was jerked from my hands because of the feedback.

My FFB is set very low, you can only notice it if your actually feeling for it. I highly suggest you start working without it if you are looking to get into competitive racing. A wheel jerking around is not realistic at all, and will not help your lap times.","1367367438"

Companies simply don't have large ""applied research"" divisions anymore(think batman), especially not in bio-medical science. Those days have long passed. Inf act, even pharmaceutical companies generally rely on the NIH to fund all the grunt work. They just take over at the clinical trial stage. 

The only exception I could think of is biomedical engineering making artificial organs and shit, but that requires you to be an engineer(and they have no trouble getting a job in private industry anyway)

Edit: About donations... people are pretty short-sighted(and understandable selfish). Why would they donate to something that may or may not have any benefit to them, and if it does, it may be 10 years down the line. When they could just buy something cool.... disease research foundations do get donations but its nothing compared to the NIH. There's no reason to think that research foundations for things that don't  directly affect peoples' ""loved ones"" would get funded at all.

Edit2: Additionally, companies(stockholders) don't like to take risks without some kind of pretty much guaranteed monetary return. Research doesn't work that way.","1367367446"

"videos","t5_2qh1e","First off, I wanted to thank you so much for posting this video; it really touched my heart.

My mother has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember, she worked almost every day as a waitress; and she loved doing it even if it was considered a job. When she was in the bathroom one time, fixing her hair; she slipped on a puddle of water and fractured a couple of disks in her back and some of them even shattered; along with some hip damage, and got some medication for it. She used to be a drug addict; maybe because of the medication given to her when she hurt her back got her hooked on other harder drugs, but it lead up to her having a divorce with my father and got sent to rehab. I was able to see her twice a week and after awhile was able to sleep there during those days instead of getting picked up at night. After she moved out of rehab (she moved into a friend of her's house from her job), she joined AA and never turned back; and she gained new friends that helped her out along the way. One even gave us an old house mobile home that she moved out of since she was moving in with her husband. My father was incredibly verbally abusive to us, even to the point of throwing dishes in anger; and calling us retarded and other names. We always wanted to stay with our mother full time, every week we went to our moms we'd be uptight; irritable, and anxious the moment we got into her car. We'd tell her what our dad did this week,  but my mother didn't realize how badly he was yelling at us, thinking of the man she married and loved when we were being raised. 

I grew up having A.D.D so I was put on medication; my father blamed my mother for that since she had it as well. Most of the medications gave me bad side effects like severe 'tick' spasms in my neck. After switching medication to Adderal, it triggered my first seizure; even when I was off of it, I was told I had epilepsy which I was born with but the Adderal triggered the first one. My father still blamed my mom since she smoked weed when she was pregnant with me; which isn't true but he's ignorant about it. He was really upset because I was surfing and he went to the beach a lot and usually forced me to go even when I didn't want to; which over the years made me sick of it. Don't get me wrong, I love my father for doing that and always wanting to form a relationship with me; but his verbal abuse was just too much and even when told to stop doing it, he wouldn't. As much as I'd want to form those bonds again, he's still verbally abusive and when asked if he took anger management classes; he said he took them but then later on admitted he lied and never took them because he thought he didn't need it. 

So I've been living with my Mom from pretty much since the age of 13, and when I was around 17; court ruled that my Mom would be in full custody for her and he had to pay child support. A couple months later, my mom had to undergo surgery on her neck for the disk replacements; and I had and wanted to drop out of school so I could take care of her. I quit my epilepsy medicine short after and starting smoking medical marijuana to help with my epilepsy since the medicine I was using before (Depakote) made my hair fall out and made me feel like an emotionless zombie and has helped me a lot more than the over the shelf medicine ever had.

Now I'm 20, and I've met a lot of cool friends, but I can't get my drivers license because of my epilepsy; and my mother can't drive because her hips are in constant pain due to either broken hips or fractures; and her spine disks are having a domino effect due to the metal ones pushing on the real ones and starting to fracture them. She doesn't want another metal one because it'll just do the same and met people who's had it happen. So I'm not able to get a job because I'm not reliably  able to get a ride, and my brother can't get his license since he's not old enough. We've been living off of my mom's disability and child support; and I've been looking for a job ever since on the internet. I'm studying programming and I've been trying to get my GED since then, but haven't been able to get the money for it since we're behind on bills since we took in a couple of people when they were in need a couple months prior.

I'm incredibly close with my mom, cheering her on every year she's been free from abusing; and I love her to death, and I don't like having her stress about being negative every month and having to not eat or look at an empty fridge because I can't get a job. Having to deal with the cockroaches and fleas we have around because we can't afford bug killer every week. We've been slowly trying to dig ourselves out of the hole, but it's been hard; and I really want to help support her some way but I can't. Seeing this video keeps me motivated to continue searching and trying to find a job so I can try to help help her out in some way, so I just wanted to thank you so much for posting this video.

* Color Correction: Most of the footage looked dull and colorless, color correction gives your final product that ""wow"" factor even if the video quality isn't that high.

* Keeping a consistent video frame throughout the edit: Most of the footage was fine, but some of the shots were cropped and lost a bit of my attention.

* Panning movements during production: I think its time to invest in a decent tripod or make a homemade jib crane to get ""sexy"" panning shots that are super smooth.

* Video and music syncing: I did notice at the beginning you did sync the music with the video, but if you did it a little more during the edit it would catch a lot of attention.

* Title font: Try to download some badass font from online to make your title and credits look awesome.

* Slo-motion: Everybody loves having that one slomo shot of a sick standy, why don't you try!

Part of my essay on [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Superheroes-Best-Philosophy-Culture-ebook/dp/B005CDYQOQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367367274&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=superhero+philosophy)! 

Superheroes: The Best of Philosophy and Pop Culture by William Irving, a nonfictional e-book, is about primarily centered on the philosophical aspects taken upon the comic book industry. This digital book embarks the reader upon learning various philosophical concepts created by philosophers such as Immanuel Kant, Aristotle, Descartes, Plato, and others. The reader takes part as Irving shows how these scholars’ opinions can be applied to stories of superheroes such as Captain America, the Green Lantern, Thor, and more. Examples of these comparisons include chapters of Captain America exemplifying egalitarianism, why the Batman refuses to end the Joker’s life, and other thought-provoking notions. William Irving takes a twist on an otherwise bland and tasteless concept. The author manages to apply various literary devices in seemingly perfect locations. He uses puns, metaphors, similes, sarcasm, and irony in ways that manage to capture the reader’s attention as well as provoke questions into the reader’s thoughts - an ability that very few authors present.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","Oh absolutely man, wasn't arguing any of that.  I do tend to agree that people from similar social and economic backgrounds may behave similarly, but how they behave could vary greatly.  I don't think that the OP is necessarily trying to sell that all black people are ""bad"" but more so that his perception of blacks has been damaged by that actions of a group of blacks, who may or may not represent the ""ethos"" of the majority of said society.

Now the stereotype thing was more a joke than anything else, but I do find them, periodically, to be ""loosely based"" on the perceived qualities of a group.  Honestly, I am kind of a shitty driver too, but nowhere near as bad as a woman(JK, sexism is still cool right?).  And yes, I'm not a fan of it but asian porn has led me to believe that the majority of us asians do own smaller...appendages than some others...potentially.  Not all of us.  Someone might be hiding a purple godzilla under their kimono, but as an average, I'd say we're packing less heat as a whole.

As for the latter point...it really could be either.  Who knows if its a genetic predisposition, I kind of doubt that personally, but its possible.    Or it could be that our culture does have much underlying racism and because of this, blacks are sought out and prosecuted more harshly.  That I could get on board with more so than the former.  However, I don't necessarily believe that racist attitudes have a large place in the conviction of blacks for felonies, at least in the first hand sense of like a racist cop or something planting evidence.  At least not to the degree that would inflate the numbers well past what the statistical average should be.  And that racist attitude argument does somewhat help the point of not all convicted are guilty, but I'd wager to say that the majority that get caught, are in fact guilty of the accused crime.  Especially considering that most convictions come from confessions, but then that opens a whole other can of worms in that, was the confession forced, were the tactics used by the officer the same that would have been used if the perp was of another race, etc.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","Balderdash, the High Court very, very rarely takes a orginalist/textualist interpretation of the constitution, it just doesn't happen. There has been open condemnation of the use of originalist thought processes here, with the recently appointed Gageler J strongly arguing the reasons why an originalist interpretation just doesn't work in Australia. One of the reasons Gageler gives is we simply do not know what the actual framers intent was, as they weren't exactly in open agreement over the meaning of/what should be in the constitution. 

This is most evident in the first 25 years of the Court, where the huge shift in how the constitution should be interpreted took place. Led by Sir Issac Issacs, the *Engineers* case did away with the implication that the legislative rights of the states need to be considered when assessing the Cth's power to legislate. What's bizarre is, the proponent of the previous reserve powers doctrine, Griffths was a key member in framing our constitution, while Issacs was as well. So when considering what the framers intended, do we go with Griffiths 'small' Cth government, or Issacs 'larger' Cth government? In the end, a orginalist interpretation just becomes a guessing game, defeating the reasons for the process in its entirety.


If the Cth government does legislate for same-sex marriage, and its validity is challenged, I seriously doubt they'll restrict themselves to an intellectually dishonest method of interpreting the constitution, it's just not how they work.","1367367451"

Especially:

&gt;There are several packages that attempt to make a modified version of Spire work on iOS 5.1.1 and 6.x - Spite, Siriport, i4Siri, Ac!D, etc. - basically by forcing your device to have both iOS 5.0.1 and 5.1.1 or 6.x code running on it at the same time. This causes a lot of instability (and often boot loop) that can only be solved by restoring your device. Even if people patch those packages to work better, mixing iOS 5.0.1 and 5.1.1 parts like this is always going to cause problems.

I woul suggest the same thing that other suggested. Save your blobs, restore to 5.1.1 (and I think that Cydia's iOS 5 blobs are fine, not sure though), and don't attempt a Siri port in the future.","1367367458"

Anti atheist? No. I don't even read the bible I don't follow any religion , but there's good atheists and asshole atheists. Good atheists don't go around being edgy telling people what to think and that their beliefs aren't real , they do it professionally , don't bash a certain people like Christians or Muslims just because some of their people may be a certain negative way. The way I see it you fall under the category of the asshole atheist.

I' used to be a godless person , that science can explain everything , even if it hasn't yet , but then again we don't know what dark matter is or everything , so that may give the possibility of a ""god"" , but not a god specifically like the one in any written book that religions follow.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","This was on a different Boat. We were on our way to St Maarten from Panama. Around 3 am I heard a cargo ship talking to another vessel about some boat telling them they might run into trouble. It was really broken and I thought I heard something about people in the water. The coordinates weren't far from us.  As there was no Distress call sent there was nothing to go on that would kick off a search and rescue operation. 

I woke the captain and told him what I heard. He called up the cargo ship and essentially it was all second hand info but there might or might not have been a boat that got in to some trouble. We steamed over to the vessels last reported position but with no distress message or contact directly with the boat we had nothing to go on. We searched for about 4 hours in the area. There was a lot of diesel on the water but other than that nothing really to go on. No debris or anything. At that point we decided to move on and let it be as other than some fuel in the water there was no sign of any trouble. 

Just as we were resuming our original course I saw a Search and Rescue Transponder (SART) on Radar. It essentially shows up on radar as a bunch of dots leading you to a spot where someone is in distress (an active sart is the same as calling mayday over the radio). We called it in to a french cargo ship since they were a lot closer (It was 6 nm away). They pulled 3 people out of a little tender, one of them who happened to be the captain who informed the ship that there were 18 people still missing. 

This kicked off the whole search and rescue which meant that any boat passing through was essentially called in to assist with search and rescue (also, we were in 5m seas so it wasn't nice out). After about a day of searching nothing had been found. There was a lot of debris starting to show up. We did have a body float by our boat around sunset. We unfortunately were not able to recover it. By the time we turned around we had lost sight of it (despite two spotters doing nothing but pointing at it). We suspect it sank shortly thereafter. The person was definitely dead as he was face down with no lifejacket. 

Around 2 am we called the coast guard ship who had finally arrived on scene if we could leave as we were exhausted and couldn't do much at night (it was 38m sailboat so we couldn't see as far at night and only had 7 crew). They gave us permission to leave and I remember going to bed. When I got up we were on our way back. Sometime early morning another boat had found a life raft but they were having trouble getting everyone on board. The seas were still pretty rough and the people were pretty weak from hypothermia. We were returning to assist since we had lower freeboards and could get them on board easier. By the time we arrived 5 hours later they had managed to just get the last person on board. 

As the story goes, the fishing trawler had lost steerage and had rolled and sank. The chef was asleep at the time and had gone down with the ship. Three were pulled out of the small tender and 15 from the liferafts. We never got a good handle on full numbers as they kept changing every hour how many people were on board when it went over however if I remember correctly the only other person lost was the body we tried to recover. 

It didn't get much coverage, I remember seeing an article that gave all the credit for the rescue to the french cargo ship despite the fact that they were just ignoring the SART until we called them. Anyways, 18 people were saved which is the important part. 

As for the piracy, that was just your standard run of the mill them chasing us and us running and brandishing weapons, shooting flares at them while calling the nearest NATO warship for assistance (which happened to be the Portuguese warship we had pissed off the night before when they mistook us for pirates and we started hitting them with lasers to get them to back off (thinking at the time they were a cargo ship)). After that a submarine surfaced in front of us and escorted us through Bab-el-Mandeb. ","1367367463"

Luckily there was a big group (like 8 people) from my school who also got arrested, so that helped time fly by much faster, cause we just hung out and dominated the big cell (which had at least 16 people). One of the cops was cool, who had to breathalyze us the next day, so we hung out with him a little bit whenever he led us through a part of the process.

THe experience was much better later in the night/early morning cause we were all wasted. Food sucked. The whole process was stupid, the whole 'walk over here', legs over here, chain your feet and arms here, walk over here, sit down there, wait for your judge, now walk over here, wait here, step over there, legs up, chains off, wait here, now back into the cell. I dont know if it's suppose to be humiliating, but it was a fucking waste of time.

"IWantToLearn","t5_2rjo5","As someone who actually prefers DMing to playing, my advice is to focus on entertaining the players above all else. While an epic, Lord of the Rings-esque campaign may sound appealing to run as a DM, keep in mind that many people would be bored by such a generic, overdone setting.

I grade my sessions based on how many times my players laugh. It is the DM's job to not only run the game, but to entertain the players and make sure they don't get bored. And a quick way to make players bored is to take control away from them, so they aren't paying attention. A common trap that many DMs fall into is that they introduce an NPC who ends up being the DM's self-insert; this NPC ends up leading the party and stealing screentime that would otherwise belong to the players. Don't do that.

Another pitfall for a DM is to abuse combat. While combat done right is entertaining, overusing combat that goes strictly by the book can get old real fast. Whenever you can, introduce elements that put a twist on combat, whether it be interesting terrain, a time limit, or ways to manipulate objects in the environment. Repeated combat sessions in a series of empty rooms gets old quick.

And finally, no matter how much planning you do, be ready to make up things on the fly. When I started DMing, I tried to plan out very detailed sessions in advance. When I go in sessions now, I only have a vague idea of which direction to nudge the players and a small list of NPCs, locations, adventure hooks, and combat encounters to populate the time.

"Physics","t5_2qhi6","Massless particles are still effected by gravity, though.

Just a thought experiment here:

Let's just suppose that massive regular-matter gets attracted by gravity, while massive anti-matter gets repelled by gravity. Then shouldn't massless particles that are their own antiparticles be unaffected by gravity? Additionally, would Majorana particles also be unaffected by gravity?

If the answers to the previous 2 questions are ""yes"", this would contradict much experimentally observed evidence. If the answers to the previous 2 questions are ""no"", then this would introduce discontinuities in nature: a spin 1 photon that is affected by gravity could decay into 2 spin 1/2 particles that, on average, show no reaction to gravity. 

Also, if you drew a graph with the amount of regular-matter mass on the x axis (with massless particles being at the ""0"" point on the x axis, and antimatter mass being on the negative end of the x axis), and the amount of gravitational attraction exhibited on the y axis, we would see a discontinuous jump at x=0.

I'm not formally trained in this level of physics, but I can't help but think that this is absolutely nothing more than scientific sensationalism.

---

Side note: I have a general question about particle physics. Is it done in mostly the same way as regular quantum mechanics? i.e. if I understand Fermi's Golden Rule, the ladder operators from the Linear Harmonic Operator, and the Jaynes-Cummings model, would I be able to pick up on particle physics relatively easily? Or would I have to understand the Dirac Equation and that [crazy, extremely scary-looking Lagrangian](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/1/8/d/18d735c89fbfe8fccfd54ed003e39109.png)","1367367469"

What actually happens is, as the individual photons move through a medium (say, glass), they collide with the electron shells of the atoms in the medium. They are absorbed into the shell by bumping an electron into an unstable, higher-energy orbital. After a time, this electron decays into a lower and stabler orbital, and the photon is re-emitted on its path. 

While the photon is a photon, it is always travelling at c. But its relative speed through the medium, as a wave, can be far less than c because it keeps hitting atoms and getting 'paused'. ","1367367471"

&gt;Correct?

So, this harping is disingenuous. You can only argue that whomever is in charge of choosing for the LIFE of the child must take into consideration that there are people willing to be parental (supportive, emotional, financial, etc.) figures in the child's life

No it isn't.  Pregnancy is a risk of having sex.  By having sex you are admitting there might be a pregnancy--this works for both sexes.  Unfortunately, there is no way to guarantee it doesn't happen.

&gt;To have all that power and then force someone into ""indentured servitude"" to serve the mother possibly over the welfare over the child (the current system) is a mockery.

It is a risk you take when you have sex.  The child should not have to suffer because the father is a selfish asshole.  If you don't want a child that bad, don't have sex with a woman who won't have an abortion.","1367367473"

I realize that these tragedies are tragedies, but I also realize that they are bound to happen because there are crazy assholes in this world. Saying that because I don't agree with your political agenda after a tragedy means I'm comfortable with the tragedy is sort of like saying that accepting that death will come means you're comfortable with death. No. It means I understand that there is pretty much nothing you can do to stop it.

I'm from the US, and while I don't have a Tottenham or Schalke crest I support the two of them based off the games of theirs I've watched this season (and I liked Schalke in FIFA, but I heard you hate videogames). I wish, probably more than almost anything, I could stand in the supporter's section at White Hart Lane or the Veltins Arena. The best I can do now is go to a university game or wait until the unstoppable **Des Moines Menace** resumes play. Sure, glory hunters exist, but they'd be glory hunters regardless of if they were born in Manchester or Massachusetts.

&gt;Arsenal fans that make every. single. thread. about Arsenal.

Yeah it's annoying, but it's bound to happen when 1/8 of the active members of /r/soccer are Arsenal fans.

&gt;The way every single fucking goal scored in a Chelsea, Man U, Barcelona etc match needs to be posted as a gif as a new thread.

Grinds my gears as well, some super average gifs pop up on the front page after being in a match thread that garnered &gt;200 comments while at the same time a much better goal from a lesser team will go unnoticed on page 2 or much lower than it should be.

&gt;Americanisms. What the fuck is flopping. I understand America is new to the sport, but please learn how to speak about it.

It takes time, and most people change after they find out what the most common term is for something. You really can't tell what flopping meant in its context? Seems self-explanatory IMO.

&gt;While we're at it, the subreddit is called /r/soccer. Football is much, much bigger than Yankee hand-egg so why haven't we got the /r/football sub?

/r/football is also a subreddit for association football but since the plurality of /r/soccer subscribers and contributors are American, the American term is used. I personally prefer the term soccer because of its specificity and the fact that ""football"" can mean any number of sports.

&gt;The mild-mannered politeness of this place annoys the tits off me. I want to be able to speak about football as if I were in a pub, **where the real knowledge of the game lies**. I want to be able to use the venom and bias we all hold so dear and attack anyone and everyone else's opinions, as it should be done. None of this ""well, I respect your opinion"" bollocks. More ""fuck off you dirty Leeds twat"" kind of thing.

If enough people on /r/soccer wanted this sort of attitude, it'd be upvoted while respectful posts were downvoted. Fortunately that's not the case. Online discussions with people known only by their words and usernames do not need the personal banter enjoyed in pubs and at the games. And while I've never been to a pub during a match, I just had to lol at the bold, especially when a sentence later you say you'd prefer offensive banter like is in pubs--as if yelling at opposing fans makes you more knowledgeable but actual discussion does the opposite.

&gt;People mentioning anything at all to do with football computer games. ""He was great on football manager 2013"" or whatever should be an instaban.

Somewhat annoying.

&gt;Abbreviating. EPL, USMNFT or whatever the fuck that is. It's the Premier League. Your team are America.

USMNT looks awful but EPL is quite a useful abbreviation. You must not like abbreviations in general.

"Austin","t5_2qhn5","Hey there. [I made a thread a couple months ago about the same problem if you want some more free feedback](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1c2flg/heres_me_bitching_about_the_real_estate_market_in/)

Good news though. It IS possible to get a house. We just went under contract on Friday at noon (after the house was put on the market Thursday at noon). This was in the Tanglewood subdivision (hopefully it wasn't the one you got outbid on, lol). I was going to make a reddit thread about it, but this thread looks good to me.

**Our rejected offers:**

**15k over** on a foreclosure (We think a cash offer showed up which is preferable in foreclosure situations, but it turns out it had a federal tax lien so it woulda been a headache anyway) with 3k closing costs cash-back (CC)

**6k over** on an Oak Hill house with 2k CC

**11k over** on a Tanglewood house with 2k CC

After the third one, I had my realtor basically email the selling agent and ask ""WHY, OH GOD WHY""

The selling agent said our offer was strong, but we were literally the only offer that was asking for closing cost cash from the sellers. I know you just sold a house so you might not be worried about closing costs anyway.

So when we saw the next house that we absolutely wanted, we did a few important things:

**1)** We bid 15k over instead of 10k over (asking was 190k)

**2)** We didn't ask for any cash back to cover closing costs (by this time we'd saved it up anyway)

**3)** We sent a letter with our offer. This was a one page PDF that basically described who we were, and what (specifically) we like about their house, and why it is basically THE HOUSE OF OUR DREAMS. We also included a cute picture of the both of us, and talked about why we want to live in South Austin, and what we like about the neighborhood, etc. This letter is probably key, and the owners actually contacted my wife through Facebook saying how nice the letter was, and how it helped sway their decision.

It's a freakin' ridiculous market to buy a house right now, but the summer should show some small amount of reprieve for you, I believe. No idea how much it will help, but a lot of people will probably be selling this summer who have waited since the crash. 

We probably looked at about 30-35 houses and made offers on 4 houses before we finally snagged one. Also we had a few missed opportunities (the houses disappeared from the market within hours after seeing it. You need to be ready to make a split decision). Spoiler alert: My wife didn't get to actually see the house in person until we were under contract. Glad I know what kinda houses she likes by now though :P

You're on the right track over-bidding.. just make sure you have enough to cover the difference in the potential low appraisal.

You shall find a house! BELIEVE!","1367367478"

There is only anecdotal evidence at best to support ghosts and spirits.  Almost always people have something to gain from a ghost story.  Read scientific journals about the human mind and you will realize how easily humans are deceived by our own minds and senses.   When I was a Christian I thought I was being visited by a demon when I was young, now I realize that they were a combination of night terrors and my own willingness to accept that demons were real.  Even if you had a spiritual encounter, are you 100% positive that there was no factors from chemicals, EM energy, drugs, alcohol, and your own deceptive mind.  Phantom limp syndrome is when people loose their limbs, yet swear they can still feel it.  It is obviously not there, so there brain is sending them false information, it actually happens all the time.  During trials 2 witnesses will witness a crime and when asked to recall the crime give 2 very different stories.  Over time the stories may change and even the confidence of the witness about the credibility of their story.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","

&gt; 1)	How old are you?  Are you male or female?  What nationality/ethnicity are you?

20, Male, White British

&gt; 2)	What is your occupation?

Caterer

&gt; 3)	Did you grow up with religion?  If so, which?

 Christian, probably mostly closely aligned with Evangelical beliefs while attending a Baptist Church.

&gt; 5)	How do you self-identify now?

Atheist, secular humanist

&gt; 6)	How did you come to reach your present set of ideas or philosophy?  

Gradual painful disenfranchisement with many things I'd taken for granted — faith healings, religious experiences, Biblical inerrancy, the End Times, the logic of things like the trinity. When I was 18, after a night of bawling on the floor asking for ‘a sign’ while my parents were on holiday in Spain, I called the Samaritans (a secular UK charity who offer emotional support for anyone who needs to offload (the only time I've ever used the service, I'm not sure why I decided to do it)) and just talked over the whole thing while still crying. I gradually accepted that I was an atheist.

After this, I discovered a whole new world. The atheist community, the amazing efficacy of *real* academia and science for finding out useful things, a normal guilt-free sex life, the possibility of having a worthwhile and ethical life without needing a God to tell you how to do it.

&gt; 7)	What worked for you or what didn’t work for you in your previous system?

Probably mostly explored in the previous question. Faith healings were always invisible illnesses (though my belief in faith healing was probably one of the strongest elements of my faith, and the hardest for me break out of. Even when I initially became an atheist, I still found faith healings nagging me as being real because they had seemed real at the time); religious experiences only seemed to happen when people were expecting them to happen, in dimly lit rooms with atmospheric music and lighting and a charismatic speaker in the room — the moment I looked at the situation with a little bit of skepticism, it was so easy to see that it was almost like hypnosis, leading you into a state of emotional suggestibility; the Bible was so obviously contradictory in places, and had been disproven in others, such as the creation (which I literally believed), and I found the character of god to be utterly inconsistent, somehow both loving and obscenely violent, becoming more complex as the book goes on and it was clear people were just making it up as they went along; the End times were not actually happening...

&gt; 8)	What do you think is your purpose in life, if any?

I don't think there's an intrinsic purpose to life. However, life is still interesting, and I can find my own ‘purpose’. Life just happens, but that's ok. It's better than not having life, surely?

&gt;9)	Do you think humanity has a purpose?  If so, what?

 We should work together toward a common purpose I think, but I don't think that purpose has to come from god. If humanity could work together to eradicate poverty, explore the stars, improve our lives, etc, that would be great. These ideals or ‘purposes’ are just as worthwhile even without a god.

&gt;10)	Do you think you have a soul, or that there is a spiritual aspect to your life?

Not a real soul, but the sort of things we attribute to the soul — emotional and mental wellbeing, our cumulative life experiences, our sense of identity, our sense of awe should still be given due care. I think you can something similar to spiritual without believing in magic or spirits. Listening to music, walking in the hills, spending time with loved ones, taking time to reflect on life and the ‘big questions’ can all be part of an atheist, skeptical worldview. It doesn't really matter if you want to call it ‘spiritual’ or not.

&gt; 12)	How do you determine what is right and wrong?  Do you create your own system, or do you also look to other sources or authorities for guidance sometimes?  If so, which ones?

Pretty much just empathy. I have not read much on the subject of morality except summaries on wikipedia and Sam Harris' The Moral Landscape, which was somewhat lacking. So though I'd like to explore the topic further, I basically just personally value fairness and kindness because I know that it is nice when people are fair and kind to me.
 


&gt; * As a white, straight, Christian, educated, American male living in the South, I know I'm living pretty much at the top of the heap.  I know that majority privilege is a thing, but I don't have many conscious experiences of it myself.  Could you share with me a time where you experienced ""Christian privilege"" or saw it at work?

 In Britain, the Church Of England gets automatic seats in Parliament, and our schools are to provide worship for the students by law. If the school is not run by another faith group (e.g. Muslim), it is assumed that the school should provide Christian worship. Thankfully, this law is often only loosely enforced. However, the school system remains very pro- faith school, and many districts even offer travel subsidies for children to travel long distances to get to a school of their parents' faith. Because faith schools are more prevalent in wealthy areas and generally perform well in student attainment, many parents fake religion for a months to get permission to send their child to the best schools (some schools require permission from a local pastor to attend). 


&gt; * Emergent church leader Brian McLaren and author of *A New Kind of Christian*  is quoted as saying (from my paraphrase) ""The question of evangelism should no longer be ""Do you want to go to Heaven?""  but ""Who do you want to be in twenty years?""  Do you agree or disagree?  Do you think that Christianity offers a path to being a better person?

No, not at all. I find the very motion insulting. There are plenty of shitty Christians, and plenty of generous atheists. No one has a monopoly on being a better person, but one side believes something that most likely isn't true.

&gt; * Have you had positive experiences with church?  If not, what would a positive experience look like for you?  What would you like to see in a church?

Yes, plenty. But they were only pleasant at the time. Now I look back and realise it was all very strange. They were nice people, and most of the time, not too crazy. But we all behaved in a very strange way when we were ‘being religious’, praising and singing to someone (who I now believe is) imaginary. In hindsight it is weird, but at the time it seemed nice. It was like waking up from a dream, I suppose. 

What would I like to see in Church? 

Honesty.

But then there would not be a Church. 

&gt; * Organized religion often gets a bad rap, and often deservedly so.  If you were the leader of a group of people with like-minded beliefs and wanted to have a positive impact on the world around you, what would that look like and how would you do it?  Along similar lines, is there anything that would get you interested in getting involved with a church, whether through non-profit work, volunteering, or anything else where you're spending time with church members?

Very interesting question. I enjoy the ideas of Daniel C. Dennett, who proposes that Churches do a lot of things right — particularly providing a supportive community, and mobilising people to do charity work. A secular version of such a community would possibly do a lot of good in the world. In the U.K at the moment there is an experiment in atheist churches, where people get together on a Sunday morning, sing uplifting pop songs, and listen to interesting talks by different speakers then socialise after the ‘service’. They hope to expand into organised charity work soon, too. I think this is a great replacement for organised religion. http://news.discovery.com/human/life/atheist-church-set-to-go-global-130308.htm Here is an article on the subject.

Diet is the best way to drop the pounds and sets the stage for exercise by providing your body with the nutrients it needs to work hard and get swole.  Remember the holy trinity (chicken, rice, and broccoli) for when you're ever in doubt on what to eat.  And remember this golden rule for gaining or losing weight:

Use more calories than you put in, you'll lose weight.  Use fewer calories than you put in, you'll gain weight (and hopefully muscle if you worked out hard enough).

Sounds like the trainer was doing some basic and safe things to evaluate your fitness and identify any weaknesses - a great place to start.  Keep reading and studying here and other resources.  Maybe in a month or so (or when you're tired of paying your trainer :p) you'll feel comfortable starting something like Starting Strength on your own.

In the mean time, if you have any questions swing on by and keep up the awesome work (and quit smoking)!","1367367491"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","While I was in High School. I would come home late due to basketball practice and be the last one to go to bed. I had my own room and my little brother's room was across from mine. Around 11pm I would hear pots and pans and the water running in the kitchen downstairs. My bedroom is right above our kitchen. I didn't think anything of it figured it was my brother or parents having a snack. It happened for about a month until I realized all those times i've heard those noises I never hear anyone ever come up stairs back into their rooms. After I realized that the very next day my mom comes into my room and tells me that I shouldn't be eating too late and not to be too loud. My brother walks in and says that I'm too loud and it's hard for him to get back to sleep right after. I told them it wasn't me and I thought it was my brother who was making those noises. The look on my mom's face still haunts me today. She just stared blankly at me and with a monotone voice just said ""Oh it was probably just your dad""

Fast forward couple months. My brother and I came home from school with a couple of friends. My parents are both at work at the time so we invited some friends over. I had the playstation in my room and to get to my room you have to pass an office and a bathroom before you get to my room. We all walk towards my room just talking and I noticed that the bathroom light was on. Right when I was walking towards it Lights turned off and the faucet and shower turns on full blast. My friends thought it was a prank to scare them. I still can't explain what happened that day.

I wrote an FR about it and people were so horrified, I deleted it.

Probably my second greatest moment was when I talked to the homeless junkie's parole officer and got him sent back to prison for parole violations.

Probably my third greatest moment was when she sent a recent ex-bf after me, he threw a punch (in front of witnesses) and he ended up serving 60 days for assault (well, also parole violations).

Probably my fourth greatest moment was when a friend of mine told me she was fired from a teaching job for making inappropriate sexual advances on a student.

`There is a lot of room here for a measured argument about this.  Ron Paul brings up a good point here, that regardless of the shelter in place request, an area of a large metropolitan area was completely occupied by a militarized police force and homes were searched without warrants.  Tanks were rolling down streets and men with assault rifles and full tactical gear were walking the streets. This is something of an unprecedented move in modern American history, and it should cause us to reflect on where we are.`

`There are plenty of arguments both for and against what happened:`

`Pro:`
`There was no way of knowing what threat Tsarnev posted.  We are dealing with a man who allegedly bombed a public event, got into a shootout with police, and threw explosives out of the window of his car.  It is within reason to suspect that he could have more weapons and explosives at his disposal and posed a real and immanent threat to the area.   Because of this unknown threat, we should act in an utter pre-cautionary matter, use all of the tools and tactics at our disposal, and catch this guy.  The shelter in place request was just that, a request, not an order.  Businesses were still open and you could walk around and carry out your day (at your own risk.)  The immanent threat created an exception to search and seizures rules, and the police were acting well within a legal framework.  To my knowledge, I have not heard anything about the police being belligerent or causing any harm to any individual or property at the homes they searched.  Most people in the Boston area were happy to comply with these requests.  `

`Con:`
`The police were dealing with a suspect that they already injured in a previous shootout.  The suspect was an American citizen, and thus was entitled to every right guaranteed under the Constitution.  Regardless if there was any threat to public, there are never any exceptions to the rights of freedom from illegal search and seizure, granting any exceptions would ultimately lead to a slippery slope, eroding the way the rights of every American.  The goal of terrorism is to cause a disruption in our way of life and to lead to fear and anxiety.  To effectively shutdown a metropolitan area and to use unprecedented militarized force and tactics, infringing on the civil liberties of law-abiding Americans, is allowing the terrorist action to achieve its goal.  In the end, the suspect was found outside of the locked down area, unarmed, and severely wounded.  He was found by an individual after the shelter in place request had been lifted, and potentially could have been found sooner if not for this request.  Ultimately all of these efforts were for naught and they did not have any impact on the safety of others.`

`There are also plenty of sinister arguments that are based on pure speculation, but they really don't have any merit because they are just that, speculation.  (They may be a possibility and the actual truth, but there are no facts/evidence to substantiate them.)`

`I find this to be a very difficult issue because it really rests on the issue of public security vs. individual rights and liberty.  The Government is well within its rights to protect the security of the general public during a presumed immanent threat emergency and every individual is entitled to the rights given to them under the constitution.  It is a very delicate issue.  I am not necessarily sure of my opinion here yet.   `","1367367512"

"TheoryOfReddit","t5_2rtff","I'm on the same page. 

The way I see it, there are two functions of the number score for comments; 1. to help the admins with sorting the comments, and 2. to signal to users what comments are higher rated than others (rated by other users). The first use is almost universally held in high regard; it's what made reddit great in the first place. The second use, while it seems to have helped fuel reddit's growth (lure of karma), it results in a lot of negative effects, to the extent that the top comments in many large subs were propelled there largely by crowd dynamics (people upvoting what's already been upvoted), more than the merit of the comment.  

However, the effects of visible scores was bad enough to merit a fairly significant change to the site's function for the user. Considering the highly-regarded sorting by votes will still work regardless of whether the number is visible to users or not, why undercut that by only going part way, allowing visible scores after a certain amount of time, allowing the negative crowd dynamics to take over? 

Regardless, I think it's great that it's something that's being left the moderators of the subreddits. Some places may work better with the status quo (the meta/ circlejerk type subreddits, perhaps smaller subs that haven't yet felt the negative effects of crossing the 20K subscriber threshold, etc), but having the option is great.

Zwei you have to two-hand, because you don't have the Str to one-hand, but it weighs 10 units so you'll be ditching the shield for more damage.

The Halberd doesn't have quite the same damage as the Zwei, but it's still really good at low stats because of its high base damage. It also has a really good moveset, both for 1v1 and crown control. Again, with 50 Faith and Sunlight Blade the thing hits like a truck. It also deals Thrust damage with its main attack, you you can Leo Ring it for huge counter damage, but that takes a lot of getting used to.","1367367514"

"politics","t5_2cneq","I can offer no defense of fundamentalist Christianity, because I do not believe in it.  I can only say what I and millions like me, past and present, believe.  

I believe that when Jesus said things like ""Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you,"" (Matthew 5:42), ""Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay,"" (Matthew 10:8), and ""Sell your possessions, and give to the needy. Provide yourselves with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys.  For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,"" (Luke 12:33-34), He meant them.  He was not being idealistic or rhetorical, but stating quite plainly the duty that is expected of every Christian.  In my opinion, anyone who claims to be a Christian and campaigns against aid for the poor, elderly, sick, or otherwise needy people in our society has taken the Lord's name in vain.  One cannot claim to follow Christ and ignore the very core of His message, the great commandment to love our neighbors as ourselves.

As to abortion, it might interest you to know that St. Augustine, an extremely well-respected figure in Christianity and one of the principle formulators of Catholic doctrine, believed that abortion before the ""quickening,"" i.e, before the baby kicks, was no sin.  The Catholic Church itself held this position for much of its history, and it is only since 1886 that it has reversed that stance.  Even after that, anti-abortion is largely a media-driven issue, and if my experience is anything to go by, many, many Christians will agree that first trimester abortions are at best a grey area.  Jesus Himself never spoke on the matter, and the few Old Testament verses about it seem to support the practice, rather than oppose it.  I've even had Baptists tell me that, though they don't feel that they can voice that opinion in church, sadly.  If you support late-term abortions or the like, though, then no, you won't get much support even from us liberal Christians.

Finally, gay marriage, yet another media issue.  The vast majority of Christians do not care at all if gay couples can marry.  The ones you see screaming on television do, and the hyper-conservatives go right along with them, but again, many Christians, if asked privately, will agree that gay love is no less legitimate than straight love.  All of the Bible verses about gay marriage are open to serious questions of mistranslation or lack of historical context.  Anti-gay Christians are afraid of gays because they are afraid of people different from themselves, or are afraid of their own gay desires.  They may couch it in religious conviction, but they act out of fear.

You may see most Christians as elitist, sexist, homophobic, racist, and the like, and that is a sad thing, but it is not true.  Most Christians are just normal people like you, with flaws and foibles of our own.  We have never claimed to be perfect, but merely to be trying to follow One who is.  The minority among us who work tirelessly to fan the flames of hatred and discord are not Christian in anything but name.  Jesus actually had a parable just for those times when we Christians feel entitled to judge those around us:

“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'""

`Excellent comment. Just two questions:`

`1) When it comes to illegal search and seizure, what does it matter whether he was a citizen or not if you're talking about searching **other people's** homes? Surely the issue is their rights? Come to that, what does it matter if anyone involved was a citizen? Are you saying if someone's a resident without citizenship (which I imagine is pretty common in Boston with all the prestigious universities luring students and faculty from abroad) then the police can search their homes with no warrant?`

`2) Is there any hard evidence that anyone's home were actually searched without their permission? Everything I've heard said everyone was cooperative and amicable towards the police. It's this part that males me suspect Ron Paul is full of shit, because every Bostonian seems to have been on the same side.`

Your roommate sounds like a bit of an insecure, sensitive person, but playing into that sensitivity isn't your job.

I think Welbeck's primary role -- be it due to his natural playing style or specific tactical instruction -- is to make runs that draw defenders out or that move him into space. Neither of which rarely results in personal accolade.

You mentioned that ""I don't think anyone is arguing for some form of censorship"" and I pointed out why that mistake happens every single time this discussion comes up- there's no definition for what's okay and what's not. As I said earlier, ""It seems to me that a *lot* of the furor over this issue stems from a disagreement on definitions.""

Based on earlier posts, we both agree that more varied main female protagonists would be nice. It appears we will forever disagree about the issue of sexualization based on our inability to find a definition worth using.

I also find it demeaning that you say the only people who would appreciate this art style are ""teenage boys"".

Short of it - bought a weight loss drug over the internet, didn't know it was banned, got banned for 2 years. 

It's not AFL, but goes by the same rules and got the ban under ASADA as the AFL does. 

There was an article going through the ""what-ifs"" if they were found to have taken a banned substance. Basically they can get off if they were spiked (like by a rival), but at best because they were duped by an official of their club, they could apply for leniency to get the ban down to 6 months.

All over that wikipedia page is hypocritical stances on the issue left and right. At the core of it all, he's a statist and he doesn't want a central branch of the government to grant same sex marriage to anyone. He wants the states to have the ""freedom"" to deny such freedoms. Technically it's not his fault if the states go around denying or refusing to recognize gay marriage. Doesn't mean he's not to blame for people being denied gay marriage rights in other parts of the country. Motherfucker wants to play the shell game with civil liberties.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; When human minds interact with philosophical problems, especially those of the form 'How is X possible?', they are apt to go into one of four possible states. Either (i) they try to domesticate the object of puzzlement by providing a reductive or explanatory theory of it; or (ii) they declare it irreducible and hence not open to any levelling account; or (iii) they succumb to a magical story or image of what seems so puzzling; or (iv) they simply eliminate the source of trouble for fear of ontological embarrassment. For ease of reference, I call this pattern of responses the DIME shape. The topics on which it imprints itself, and which I have discussed in some diagnostic detail in the aforementioned book, include: consciousness and the mind-body problem, the nature and identity of the self, the foundations of meaning, the possibility of free will, the availability of a priori and empirical knowledge. In each of these areas, I claim, we can discern the same fundamental pattern of debate as the object of perplexity taxes our intellectual resources, pushing us in one direction or the other. For example, consciousness familiarly provokes the following set of philosophical reactions: attempts to explain it in naturalistic, usually physicalistic, terms; declarations that is brutely irreducible and sui generis; invocations of non- natural forces and relations; denials that there is really any such thing as consciousness to begin with. And much the same can be said for the other topics mentioned, despite some variation in the details. (I must here leave it to the reader to impose the DIME shape on debate about those other topics; or she can always have a look at my book). Basically what we find, quite generally, is the threat of magic or elimination in the face of the theoretical obduracy of the phenomenon that invites philosophical attention. The phenomenon presents initial problems of possibility, which we try to dissolve with a domesticating theory, but there is always the danger that the failure of this undertaking will leave us facing magic or elimination or unwanted inexplicabilities. Free will, for instance, looks upon early inspection to be impossible, so we try to find some conception of it that permits its existence, but this conception always turns out to be dubiously reductive and distorting, leaving us with the unpalatable options of magic, elimination or quietism.(14) And so we hop unhappily from one unsatisfactory option to the next; or dig our heels (squintingly) into a position that seems the least intellectually unconscionable of the bunch.

&gt; Now TN has a view about this familiar fix: it is because the correct theory is inaccessible to the human intellect that we inflict the DIME torment on ourselves.","1367367533"

"HaloStory","t5_2vomh","The Ur-Didact's plan ironically was not much better than being taken by the Flood.  He lacked the numbers to effectively fight the flood, which led him to forcefully use the composer on ancient humans to create more Promethean Knights.  From what we can tell, while memories are retained, the composed personalities lose their sentience effectively making them slaves to the Ur-Didact's will.  The Flood was not intended to just destroy the Forerunners, eventually all species in the galaxy would have been targeted.  Had the Ur-Didact been allowed to continue his plans to fight the flood, he undoubtedly would have had to continue composing ""lesser"" species in order to fight the Flood, as their numbers would continue to increase.  The result being all life in the galaxy either taken by the Flood or composed by the Ur-Didact.  The advantage of the Librarian's plan is that the Flood was almost completely removed from the galaxy and species, Humans specifically, were allowed to repopulate and advance scientifically.  The Flood was intentionally left in stasis on the Halos in hope that we would discover it and continue to search for a way to defeat it before it returns in full force.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","It's the intermarried part that makes it perfectly acceptable.  I understand the difference between nationality and lineage, but there's no reason why  a black person in Scotland wouldn't be able to trace their ancestry in a similar way via white family members, further up their family tree.  Of course it would change plot points somewhat if they chose to go into it, as they did in Skyfall, but that's not a line they've taken often, nor have they ever minded having inconsistencies between the films.

I think in your example, if the fact that the character is a native American is ingrained in their story then yes it would be a mistake to cast another race, and certainly if it's a character based in fact.  But if you're looking for an ""American"" and you stumble across the perfect actor who is a different race to the one you had envisioned, then why not cast them?  Bond's race has never been relevant to the films, only Skyfall and OHMSS used his lineage and they could have been easily explained away with a few throwaway lines if they felt the need.

The way Americans trace their lineage is perhaps not applicable in Scotland, certainly it's not in Ireland.  I have a Norman name for example, but I wouldn't ever consider myself to be Norman or French, i'm Irish.  ","1367367535"

definition 1 (noun) ""a person who believes that nothing is known or can be known of the existence or nature of **God**""

definition 2 (adjective) ""of or relating to agnosticism""

In other words if someone says they are **an** agnostic it is religious, if someone says they are agnostic it can refer to anything.

Thanks.. this goes into a TIL for me

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","This was way back when I was in high school, and this girl (we'll call her Chloe) and I were messaging back and forth on a BBS.  After a weeks of chatting almost everyday, I asked her if she wanted to hang out.  I knew the area she lived in and the mall my friends and I used to hang out at was nearby.  

So, we arranged a time and day and I took my best friend with me.  After waiting at the spot in the mall for about 2 hours, a girl walked up and asked us if we were waiting on Chloe. We said yes, and she said she was the sister (Rachel) and that Chloe got in trouble with her mom and couldn't make it.  So we left and that night Chloe and I chatted again.  She apologized and said that she would be able to the following weekend.  The next weekend, I went back to the mall and waited and she was a no-show.  I decided to leave and got the same excuse from her the next night.

Fast forward a couple weeks and she sends me a message that she can meet that day.  So I head to the mall and wait with my friend.  The sister shows up and says Chloe is running late because of chores.  We said ok, and after walking around the mall with her, I asked if she needed a ride home.  She agreed at first, but then almost backed out.   We convinced her and as we drove down a street, she pointed to a house.  We let her out and she said bye.  She walked up to the door and knocked, then looked at us and walked around back. We waited a few minutes and didn't see her at all, so we left.  As we drove down the street, my friend said he just saw her walking down an alley.  We made a u-turn and as we did, she darted across the road and into a front door of another house. 

We pulled up and luckily for us (not to seem stalker like), she left a hairband in the car.  I got out and knocked on the door.  An older lady answered and I first said that Rachel left her hairband in the car, and she said thanks, then I asked if Chloe was home, and she gave me a weird look and said ""Who?""... I told her a little backstory, and she invited us in.  Turns out that Rachel and Chloe are one in the same, and Rachel (the real person) has had similar incidents in the past.  The mom went on to tell us that she actually got kicked out of school for telling the administration that she was her twin sister and that her ""twin"" died in a crash.   

We actually ended up being friends for a bit afterward.  The person I met online was a lot like the girl I met in person, even though we would occasionally catch her in a lie.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","It's possible.  Typically a woman ovulates between cycle day 13 and cycle day 17.  The first day of her period is cycle day 1.  But if she does not know what cycle day she typically ovulates it is very risky to have sex with no bc.  Sperm can live inside the body for up to 5 days just waiting for an egg.  Ovulation can be late...but it can also be early.  And yes, if this happened a week ago it is too late for EC.

I would stop having sex without bc.  Why would you do this? And no offense...your gf clearly does not have her life together.  For the love of God please DO NOT get this person pregnant.","1367367545"

Ice cubes would work, but they'd have to be PH'd before freezing.

There is a difference between accidental and intentionally, I agree, but it is actually 'common knowledge' that the mere sight of anatomy is enough to psychologically damage people and cause significant mental/emotional harm.

Think about that for a second.

Seeing your parents trapped in a burning car and slowly melting from a fire?  Severe psychological damage!

Seeing a flasher's dick?  Severe emotional damage!

Streaking, for example, isn't too uncommon at sporting events and things over in the UK.  Here you would end up with five years in jail, be labelled a sex offender, forbidden to live in most cities, have to pay a huge fine, etc.  You'd get the same amount of time for armed robbery if no one died and it was your first offense.

I can't tell you what to do, as I don't even know what I would do in your place, but if you do decide to confront her about it, just be prepared for the worst case scenario. If you decide you can't bear seeing her every day, it's a bit extreme, but it may be time to consider moving out.

Regardless, good luck.","1367367553"

Human beings are the creators of knowledge...the universe just is.  We're the ones mapping out the universe...it does not have a map itself. I see what you're attempting to state, however, it is unnecessary to make the distinction of knowledge ""out there"" and knowledge that is ""within"" or that which relates to us as human beings. The reason I state this is because the human experience is not an objective thing that was decided by an outside force, but rather is a creation of the universe itself. In reality, we are each our own little universe and thus can define our own human experience in the context of all variables that are given.  Just because there might be an infrared light shining on us does not mean it has anything to do with our experience as a whole. In fact, if we cannot detect it then we can conclude it does not exist(that's how science works right now.)

What is this way that is just ""getting along"" compared against? You seem to assume that there is some model for which we are striving. I feel that we do HAVE all knowledge of the universe within us as we are not separate from the universe and therefore cannot operate differently than the universe does.  Perhaps it would be more appropriate to say we cannot apply all knowledge at one time. I would gladly concede that notion.

To your third statement....I could agree, but I could also disagree and that goes into all my other statements.(I'm debating simply to do so, I have no hard-wired beliefs in this hypothetical)
As long as we are ""humans"" as we are defined now, I do not think that any of this is possible. I do think that we will transcend our human form and move into a new distinct form that allows us to effectively gather and apply new knowledge perpetually.

Really I think we agree, but I'm arguing semantics. I don't necessarily believe that we will never know all the ""facts"" of the universe, but I do think the ""facts"" of human experience may be unknowable if you do not decide them for yourself.","1367367559"

Don't worry about whether or not you're going to go home with a girl or not. Women should be an afterthought. Girls want to go home with the guy who's cool, confident, and fun; worrying too much about getting the right reaction just brings out the opposite in you.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Being swayed to Melkor's will makes them in rebellion against Eru, for Melkor is in rebellion against Eru.

&gt;But now Ilúvatar  sat and hearkened, and for a great while it seemed good to him, for in the music there were no flaws. But as the theme progressed, it came into the heart of Melkor to interweave matters of his own imagining that were not in accord with the theme of Ilúvatar; for he sought therein to increase the power and glory of the part assigned to himself . . .  He had gone often alone into the void places seeking the Imperishable Flame; for desire grew hot within him to bring into Being things of his own, and it seemed to him that Ilúvatar took no thought for the Void, and he was impatient of its emptiness. Yet he found not the Fire, for it is with Ilúvatar. 

While Eru is largely idle, the Valar are his stewards. They act to enforce his will, and Manwë consults Eru when he does not know how to act in Eru's vision (encountering the deaths of elves, what to do with Beren, etc.) Ilúvatar also intervenes often in the world, but subtlety, and often without being asked. It was Eru who brought the Ring to Frodo, and it was Eru who made sure that Frodo's quest succeeded when he was brought to the limit of his ability. It was Eru who sent Gandalf back to Middle-earth when the Emissaries of the Valar had failed. It is said among Men that they are mortal due to turning away from Eru and into the worship of Melkor shortly after their awakening -- and it is said among Men that one day Eru will enter into Arda to heal Men.

But more than this, one of the central themes of Tolkien's work is faithfulness to God. Melkor and Sauron hated Eru, and whenever possible brought men to worship them instead. The Númenóreans worshiped Melkor at Sauron's bidding, who preached the nonexistence of Eru. Their rebellion against Aman was not just against the Valar but the very will of Eru. Conversely, fighting against Melkor and Sauron was itself a form of showing faithfulness to God, for they would either seek to destroy God's creations or prop themselves up in place of him.

"SimCity","t5_2ryr3","Nah, I have to disagree. People have shitty visions all the time. Way more common than good ones, to be honest.

AAA games aren't prevented from having solid mechanics by any means. In fact, with their resources, they are often able to deliver an experience that indies just can't - and I don't just mean the art assets. AAAs can create much larger worlds, and include a lot more content. They also *can* (not often do, but can) hire some amazing writers capable of creating a story and dialogue you just won't find in all but one or two indie games. Indie games are often also less polished and don't control as fluidly as AAAs (can, if they bother).

I know the above makes it sound like I don't like indie games, but really I do. They show by far the most innovation and interesting mechanics, and more and more they are employing some really cool, stylized art, well, styles. But they really, really do suffer from the lack of resources. Anything the small team (or even person) can't do well becomes blatantly obvious because they can't afford to hire people to fill in their gaps. It might be the writing, the art, the optimization, or even in some cases the controls themselves.

I also don't think anybody that claims video games are art compares the likes of Modern Warfare to anything remotely resembling a Picasso.","1367367563"

I play video games to get my mind off anxiety.  The worst point of the day for me is right before bed, many times she has had to get up and go on a walk with me to calm down.  Also be careful about medications.  After all my anxiety and help, I cant stand psychiatrist or medications anymore.  I have trained myself to only take my meds when I am just on the brink of losing it.  Not always a good idea but I dont want to be weakened by medications.  Try and find something that can occupy your mind, crosswords, sudokus, or gain a new hobby.","1367367568"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; Because it doesn't look like the character. Is that not good enough, for such an established figure? Surely people have certain expectations, and one of the most basic things is having someone look the part.

It's very subjective, I guess. I can't say I've ever been a huge fan of Bond, so that could mean I'm more flexible when it comes to that in general. But trying to think of similar changes for characters I'm a fan of.. I don't really care, to be honest. To me, again, it's about pulling off the character. His personality, his background etc. So a black Bond in the 60s would maybe not work as there wouldn't have been any black secret service agents (or would there? no idea). But the current Bond movies for all I know take place in current times and I don't think a black british, suave, good looking womanizer secret agent would be any less believable as a character and could have essentially had the exact same upbringing any of the recent Bonds have had.

And, honestly, I think it would be a good sign to have traditionally white characters be played by black actors (if they are talented and fit the role, as I think Idris definitely does, and if the character's skin color isn't _essential_ to his or her personality/story). It could help in normalizing diversity (which is a bit of a clunky way to put what I'm trying to say, but it's 2am, I'm tired and not a native speaker of English, so bear with me ;) ) and breaking down that barrier a bit more, in a way, so that one day we might actually live in a world where skin color isn't really a relevant category anymore.","1367367570"

"NetflixBestOf","t5_2ro0h","This war has been brewing for years, and there's not really an end in site as far as I can tell.  Content owners like Warner, MGM, Sony, etc. want more control and better margins, and have the law on their side most of the time.  Content providers like Netflix, Hulu, etc. are really nothing more than middle men, and have to play a very delicate game since the majority of their power and influence rests entirely in the form of customer loyalty and satisfaction.

Providers like Comcast are an interesting case, since at least to some degree they are already positioned at both ends of the spectrum.  Netflix's recent forays into production are a good step in the right direction for a similar reason.

Unfortunately, one of the biggest worries from a consumer perspective is the possible advent of this provider fragmentation: as the larger content owners and producers begin to realize how easy it can be for them to jump into the streaming game, they may see a monetary benefit in ""pulling out"" from Netflix and opening up their own streaming shop, exclusive to their content.  This *might* lead to significantly reduced pricing (as competition usually does), but obviously means we'd all have to have several accounts to access the wide array of programming we all really want and desire.  In the end, that probably means more total cost overall for the end user (and certainly means a lot more annoyance and concern about device/software compatibility).

Outside of the negotiating table and their burgeoning production game, Netflix is relatively powerless to prevent that.  And not that the fat cats in government give a shit, but even if they did, I'm not sure I see how any reasonable regulation could prevent this problem anyway.  I think we just have to hope that any severe fragmentation on the part of the producers and content owners fails in the open market because people are just too annoyed at all the different accounts.  We're lucky enough that Netflix plowed the road and established itself as the single be-all end-all portal to web-streamed movies and TV shows.  Not because Netflix is any more moral or consumer-driven than any other corporation, but because the standard has been set and consumers will *expect* a single portal (or at most 2 or 3) going forward.  Perhaps that will lead ventures like this Warner Bros. thing to become failures by virtue of it not having very many subscribers.  The problem is...I imagine it is a fairly low-cost endeavor for them, since they already own the content and don't have to license it.

I don't know.  It worries me.","1367367575"

Some of the material I held onto just for small fill in work, but looking at other miniatures online decided I would give it a try.

 For starting out I would recommend hitting up a thrift store for carbon steak knives ( old hickory is a good brand to use )and using them to shape down on a bench grinder, just don't let them get hot or you'll take the temper out of them.

"keto","t5_2rske","Hi there Zodi, thank you. I found this really interesting.

I cut out pop and all the sugary stuff a while ago (have since relapsed but am going to cut them all out again) but I was kind of oblivious (stupidly) to carbs. I used to think that pasta/bread was not bad for you, not healthy but not **bad**... Now.. I have a whole new understanding which is deepening with the more I learn about Keto.

Sadly I'm away on vacation and my bf's mother has been literally, cooking 2 huge serving of carbs (sometimes rice AND pasta in one day, lunch and dinner) and out of politeness and hunger I've been eating it! I'm leaving soon so I will be not eating those. When at home I don't eat rice or pasta or bread really, just meat and veg. I will be going back to that.


It sounds like you did really well cutting out carbs, a lot of people seem to be suggesting to just try cutting out the certain things and worry about the figures later (if at all). It is nice to hear this, I guess I had just seen lots of posts with people talking about their figures all the time that I thought that to do keto, you ""had"" to know all the figures to be successful. What you have told me has definitely given me hope, thank you so much!","1367367582"

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","&gt; I browsed this subreddit for a while and its never brought up

That's because this subreddit is *focused* on the consumer side of coffee. Sure, we can choose to drink one coffee over another because it is marketed as bird friendly/shade-grown/organic, but many, if not most, don't have the option. This selection is typically done by the roasting company.

Also, there's a fair amount of skepticism in the coffee community with regards to labels like ""organic"" and ""fair trade"" , so there may be some bleed over from that. Often times fair trade certified coffee isn't as fair as what is now becoming more popular, direct trade. The ""organic"" label is nice, but many smaller operations farm organically, but can't afford the certification.

Just so you're clear, your post was in all likelihood not down voted due to the information you're presenting. If the title had been ""The benefits of shade grown coffee"" (and maybe a citation or two, to go with some of those facts) I think it would probably have gone over a little bit better.

Thanks for sharing, though. Environmental conservation and sustainable agricultural techniques are very important to me, and should be for all of the coffee community.","1367367582"

I live in a pretty small city. While not everyone knows everyone, it's hard to meet someone that you're more than two degrees of separation from. For example, I found out when I started dating my boyfriend that his landlord is actually my high school french teacher. 

Now, this guy was the sorta kinda creepy teacher who was always trying to get involved in students' lives, and I found out that he was the same way with landlording. I was over one day when all his roommates were out doing something, and we were getting down to business, as you do. I was quite vocally enjoying myself when suddenly, I hear a knock on the door of his room. ""Good job, [boyfriend's name!]"" the teacher-landlord calls blithely.

- Gear is not a one-time cost.  It's not, it's an ongoing cost and cars don't need 'gear'.

- Maintenance.  You need to do it, with oftentimes more expensive oils, far more often.  Despite the lower volumes than a car, car oil changes are far less frequent.  On most bikes you'll also need to lube chains, and change sprockets now and then.

They say ""is, was, will be"" and imply that they are *simultaneous*. Just because we perceive them in a line doesn't mean they exist in a river, but they float side by side or a million miles away in an endless ocean.

Imagine this (it will be hard because it doesn't align with the way we understand time), that the grandfather paradox is NOT a paradox, that it's entirely possible for someone to go back in time and kill their grandfather WITHOUT creating another universe.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I agree that defining God primarily in terms of actions and attributes makes a good bit of sense.  The issue is that, as a being, God does have certain attributes.  Details of these are discussed in the bible and outside it, and are impossible to avoid entirely.  The notion of something being God only because of its carries out will even though it contradicts the properties of God, what make God God, is contradictory.  While it may make sense to talk about God primarily in terms of theological actions, it's meaningless to define something as God because it does God-stuff when it doesn't match what properties define God.

We could, for instance, talk about cars primarily in how they relate to us.  Cars transport us, cars require the input of resources, cars revolutionized society because of the ease of their use, cars require a capital investment, cars allow people to move from place to place quickly.  All those are the actions that make cars interesting, much as with God it's the actions that are interesting, not the properties.  However, horses, trains, subways, buses, trolleys, and airplanes do those exact same actions.  But it'd be preposterous to claim that those things are all actually cars, since they don't fit the properties assigned to cars.  Fulfilling a function is insufficient to define something--it requires actually meeting the defining properties.

edit: I almost forgot this bit:

&gt;But the key for Christians is that Christ didn't fall captive to sin. If by error we mean turning against God's will, then I would reject the idea that it's an essential part of theological anthropology.

1Kings 8:46 and Ecclesiates 7:20 say that every person sins:

&gt;&gt;If they sin against you, for there is no person who doesn't sin...

&gt;&gt;Of humans, there is none righteous who does [only] good, and does not sin.

Jesus, as described by Christian theology, fails to meet the qualities the bible described humans as having.","1367367593"

I don't know why people think there has to be some sort of intro, or steps to getting to know people.

I'm gonna look at it like learning a skill, you don't sit and methodically break down the skill (you can but it takes ages and people will get an impression of you before you get it right so you wont have time to talk to them before they think you're weird), if you just start talking to them about pretty much anything, try pick something they are interested in and just talk about it, as long as you both enjoy the conversation you will want to speak again, the more you speak the more you know each other.

Ax,y Girl(x) ^ Sailor(y) ^ Loves(x, y)

This says that for all x and y, x is a girl, y is a sailor, and x loves y. That's obviously not true. Not all x are girls. Now, it *is* true that *if* x is a girl and *if* y is a sailor, then y loves x, but that's not what the sentence says. It's the difference between:

Like one of the other comments mentioned, I am not giving my time/life to my employer in exchange for compensation, I am giving value for compensation. This is why I personally do not like working for an hourly wage, conversely I imagine people who are not results driven enjoy having an hourly wage. If I say you need to do X amount of work in exchange for Y dollars, you complete X in 4 hours but other employees complete X in 8 hours, then it would behoove me to give you a raise/promotion to compensate you for the value you provide (assuming you work the same amount of time and thus can do 2X worth of work). I could fire you and find someone else that would do X in 8 hours for Y dollars, but then I'm still paying the same amount for the same amount of work...the only difference is for 4 hours a day I see someone working instead of slacking off.

Well, we know the universe is not a *steady-state*. It (the universe, including space-time etc.) did had a beginning, The Big Bang.

&gt;In the clash between matter and anti-matter, matter won, so the energy that forms our universe could not have had a beginning **through natural causes.**

Could you elaborate on that interesting assertion?
Especially natural vs non-natural causes. Also causes outside this space-time dimension is rather incoherent. Causes presupposes time. 

&gt;In either case, a beginning or an infinite past,

&gt;there must exist a cause outside of our natural laws for the energy in our universe to exist.

I agree, there was a beginning. Pretty obvious to me, ~13,7 billion years ago. But I sense a *non-sequitur*. A finite past, does not imply a creator or first cause (god).

Not true. You just have to know your dog, and not let them in the back if you know they'll do that. Some dogs are more mellow than others. 

&gt;or that you'll hit a pothole you don't recognize and it'll go flying out because you're moving too quickly.

Unlikely. Pot holds don't generally form overnight. The ones that come after heavy rains will be visible so long as you are paying attention and not tailgating. 

&gt;that sounds incredibly reasonable to me.

Sounds like that law wouldn't get passed. Most laws don't come down to reason, they come down to feelings or, well, politics. The more likely law would be ""None in the back at all, we just can't take the chance"". And yea, they aren't televisions. But I don't put televisions just sitting in the back either. Gotta be secured somehow. Dogs on the other hand, are living creatures who can and will exercise caution. At least, mine would. I still wouldn't put them back there, but that's just me. 

&gt;You're completely missing the point, whether the ignorance is intentional or not.

Also known as Anasyrma or plural: Anasyrmata; women have been lifting their skirts for centuries to ward off evil &amp; enhance fertility. This symbolic act is also found in mythologies of various cultures all over the world, &amp; specifically in those of ancient Egypt, Greece, Persia, Ireland, Africa, Indonesia &amp; Japan.

It is said that the evil-averting gesture of women individually or collectively exposing their genitalia have the power to shame &amp; defeat an advancing army. The act of revealing publicly the hidden core of womanhood initiates a process of change that operates on a world scale, as well as on an individual level.""

"fatpeoplestories","t5_2vzax","Fat people have higher metabolic rates than thin people of the same height because they require more energy to move their fat arses around every day. Your basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the number of calories you need every day to support organ function and maintain weight. Someone with more weight to maintain will have a higher BMR.

People who do more exercise will also have higher metabolic rates because they're using more energy to move around/list/whatever, and because muscle uses slightly (*slightly*) more energy per pound per day to maintain. 5lb of muscle will use (5-10) calories more per hour than 5lb of fat. 

Some people do have higher metabolic rates than others; the average difference between two adult humans of comparable size is up to 300 calories per day. This can be due to[ non-exercise thermogenic activity] (http://atvb.ahajournals.org/content/26/4/729.long) (like dancing, having tickle fights with your spouse and/or children, kidneys needing to work extra hard to remove toxic shit from your blood), growth and repair of tissue to recover from a disease or after an accident, or they could have something wrong with them, like mildly increased thyroid activity.

http://www.fujitv.co.jp/b_hp/terrace-house/

I happened to catch this show last December and it has become my favorite show for immersion. It's a reality show (in a more western sense) with 3 women and 3 men living in a share house together. Pretty interesting cast, and I love it for the following reasons:

1. Everyone on the show speaks NORMAL conversational Japanese. There's a bit of slang, but you get a great sense of what everyday Japanese is supposed to sound like. No drama overacting or gameshow-type interviews.

2. I love the way it is shot. No wacky camera work, just straight clean shots.

Number 3 would have been the fact that there was almost zero variety style commentary fluff, but they changed that recently and added entire segments for the hosts and some random celebrities to chime in on the scenes that just played. Really bad decision imo, as this was one of the biggest appeals of the show for me.

But I definitely recommend it for conversational immersion and practice.","1367367613"

If you try fit on an obviously full train and get crushed by the doors as a result, you can't really blame the door system.
The train wasn't full, the station was but there was still plenty of room inside but due to the fact that there were so many people who entered the train it took a while until everyone was inside of it.
Why would you be taking the train that is the last one before you're late to class if the stations are crowded?
Apparently you are the one who misunderstood it here. I wasn't going to a class. I was in London with my class as tourists. It was a school trip. That's what ""stick to my class"" meant. Of course I can't split myself from my class in an other country especially if it's in a city like London.","1367367616"
"politics","t5_2cneq","He is anti-government.  Even after the supreme court forced him to reverse his 2 billion in education cuts due to his cuts being unconstitutional, he is at it again by trying to push for private school vouchers which will shit money out of public schools and into private schools.

&gt;he just accepted ACA funding for Medicaid

That was hardly a choice.  He also accepted federal education funding of 1 billion in 2010 to delay his 1 billion in cuts from hurting the state by a year.

&gt;he's anti-offshore drilling

That isn't liberal or conservative, offshore drilling isn't safe.

&gt;He's certainly not a GOP stooge either

Yes he is.  Otherwise he would stop trying to cut public education and would beg the feds to reinstate the tunnel project he killed.

Blue Dogs don't try to defund public education, so he is not a blue dog.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","""People are also free to act anyway they wish this includes imposing obligations on others.""

Yes, but I don't have to listen to your obligations unless you use some sort of coercive measures, at which point we know what my next action will be.  I'm either going to fight you back, or I'm going to leave.  Basic fight-or-flight response to being threatened.  Now if you can resist my fight (your stronger) or my flight (physically prevent me from running, or in the modern sense, leave no better option to go to), then you have effectively ""won"".  Your obligations will be imposed on me.

I see people all the time try to justify the NAP as some sort of objective morality.  Really it's just an intellectual way of describing the natural sociological response between how two or more humans will behave.
If we see the deprivation of liberty as an ongoing denial of life, and the deprivation of property as the loss of past life, then we can succinctly rewrite the NAP's basic philosophy.  If Human A attempts to take Human B's life (or liberty or property, which are really the same thing), then Human B WILL fight back or run away.  This is our basic survival instinct.

Humans are hardwired first to survive, not just as an individual, but as a species.  Anarcho-Capitalism is, I believe, the most effective way of achieving maximum survivability among both individuals, and society as a whole.  It also happens to be the natural state of man.  No laws, no rules, just a bunch of humans surviving (through mutual cooperation if they so chose).  What they do from there is up to them, but if a certain group of individuals decides to some ""rules"" or ""laws"" outside of that natural state, then the burden of proof is on them to convince others that their way is best.  Now maybe they can --in the physical sense--forcibly impose these obligations on the individuals who dissent.  However, going against the natural state is inefficient towards general prosperity, and eventually results in violent pushback or  exodus. The first is practically the definition of revolution and the second is supported by nearly every major human migration pattern in history.

As far as my ""values"".  I guess I don't really buy into the philosophy of it all.  We can build valid arguments from various ""values"" all day, but in the end we KNOW how humans WILL interact.  The real question is whether we should be fighting our natural state, or embracing it.

This is the point where I would link you to dozens of references explaining why the latter option is best, but since you specifically said not to...

Edit:  Is survivability a word?  Not sure...","1367367616"

Also, when I do it, I usually leave a bit of the teabag hanging over the free edge and tuck it under my nail, also affixing that with clear polish. I've had mine last for over a week.

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","Dude, you're depressed, and I don't mean that in the obvious sense; I mean that in the clinical sense. I too spent some hard years in the closet, and it ended up scarring me also. I finally admitted to myself that I needed to seek help and in the end I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. After some treatment, I started feeling much better. I would really recommend it.

To address some of the actual things you've talked about, I can't give you advice, because only you know what's best for yourself ultimately, but I can tell you about my own thoughts and experiences. I am a hopeless romantic, but I have never rushed into a relationship and I still have casual sex. In fact, I hold the unorthodox opinion that it's better to make sure you are sexually compatible with someone before trying to connect too deeply on a romantic level. To use an extreme example: Imagine two guys who date for a long time and fall completely in love with each other and then finally they decide to have sex and they find out that they're both total-bottoms. Then everything is complicated--a whole wrench has been thrown in the picture, which could have been avoided. I myself think the societal message that says a lot should be invested in the relationship before having sex is somewhat flawed. 

Also you very well might be right that losing your top virginity might bring you more confidence. But topping for the first time also requires a good deal of confidence and depressed people have a hard time building up confidence, especially if they have been feeling down for some time. If you're completing PhD studies, I'm sure you're a smart guy, so you may have heard of the ""correlation does not equal causation"" analysis tool. Don't assume that you're down because you've been having trouble romantically/sexually. Maybe you've (at least partially) been having trouble romantically/sexually because you're so down. Do you really know which one is causing the other? Maybe they're both causing each other. 

To really sum up what I'm trying to say, first, I really think you need to take care of your mood problems separately from everything else. They are serious and need to be addressed. Second, have you considered just looking for some gay friends, instead of romantic partners? Forget about sex. Forget about love. Forget about top virginity. Just start looking for one or two gay guys that you enjoy talking to, or playing tennis with or something. Join a gay sports league or book club or something. It's win-win: You'll *hopefully* end up losing your top virginity in a locker room with the best sex you've ever had, but if not, then you'll end up with a few new friends, a better sense of self, and higher self-esteem.
