"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Like an adult?

Adults don't whine about someone not being nice.  Kids do that when they cry to their mothers.  The fact that you're whining and derailing of ""he's not being nice"" instead of addressing the points says everything about your position.  I mean, really.  If it had anything behind it you'd just lay the facts down in my face and let them speak for themselves... kinda like how I did in my very first post.  But you don't have shit, and you know it, so you're whining about how I'm not nice rather than about how I'm wrong.  Because it's all you have left to critique me on.

&gt;I especially like that your argument for why I can't be engaged like a human being is because I don't immediately accept your original viewpoint.

That's not what I said, and you know it.  You reacted with a whine rather than facts.  You're an emotionally driven person.  I'm a factually driven person.  So now you're attempting to convince me to change my viewpoint by the way you decide yours: by shame.  Someone shamed you into believing what you do now.  I don't work that way, I work by facts.  You would have to present counter-facts for me to change my view.  But the facts are not on your side, and I'm not nearly as talented as an emotional manipulator as you are.  You don't have the facts to change my mind and I don't have the shaming skills to change yours.

So, we might as well snipe at each other ;)

&gt; because he was a humanist who believed in basically what I am saying.

He was a smart guy, but most people don't realize what he taught.  Things build upon each other.  You can't get to Esteem without having physical needs and security already well taken care of.  And just because they are taken care of now doesn't mean you take them for granted.  So when you do all these changes to society to try to increase the esteem of society... did you even consider the difference it would make in the lower levels?

I mean, really.. ""everyone needs to feel good about themselves"" while you drive for changes which destroy security by driving businesses overseas.  ""People need to be free to do what they want"" while you destroy the family.  ""Men and women are equal"" while destroying that which makes them complementary.

JENGA!

as for NE in general, it's easy to forget because of the playoff loss but they were the best team in football in the regular season last year. the only noteworthy player they've lost is Light (who may very well come back). 

a Jets fan predicting NE to finish 10-6 with no real reason is obviously going to get some flak. If I predicted the Jets to go 8-8 (only 3 games worse than their 2010 record, versus your 4 game difference for NE) without any good reason i'd expect to be called on it too.","1312156811"

I think there are fundamental flaws with the mens' rights subreddits on Reddit in that they *are* sexist (no actually, I think they are plain old bigoted.)

Those subreddits exist to push the agenda that all men are somehow abused and marginalized in modern society, but with few exceptions this is a demonstrably false assertion. Further, while feminists have made alliances with every other type of equal rights group (i.e. LGBT groups, black groups, etc.) the mens' rights movement actively bashes and discourages these groups (i.e. /r/Rights4Men says right on the sidebar ""DO NOT POST LINKS TO:... 2. LGBT anything"" I guess gay men aren't ""men enough"" for the mens' rights people.) Men's rights is about pushing the agenda of predominantly white, middle-class, heterosexual males, often to the exclusion of everyone else.

For example, I can easily see the various feminist subreddits discussing some of the problems men face with custody battles and the like, and doing it in a respectful and open way, but on the other hand the mens' rights people tend to vilify every feminist as evil harpies who want to emasculate men. They can't even have a mature discussion about women without bringing in their butt hurt feelings, blaming women for them, then crapping all over women everywhere.","1312156812"

Also, thanks. I'm not sure if I would consider myself brave but I just knew I was getting tired of hiding it and tired of her badmouthing the LGBT community at times just because of ignorance. She knew no one that was part of it so she jumped to many inaccurate conclusions. I knew she wouldn't immediately be all 100% behind it etc but I did expect her to make more progress than having her basically plug her ears and go "" la la la ""

Not only does it apply to this situation, it applies to any refutation of a universal claim when a counterexample is provided. Furthermore, it is up to the person to decide if they are a christian, not the bible. It is a little like this. You probably wouldn't consider a christian to be an atheist would you? But what if they identify themselves as an atheist? Their reasoning could be that they believe only in god but not in the FSM or in Allah. Because they don't believe in those gods they are atheistic towards them, and consider themselves to be an atheist who believes in one more god than normal. Just because they don't meet your criteria doesn't mean they aren't what they say they are. What about the gay marriage debate? When people say that gay people cannot truly be married because they aren't heterosexual couples does that mean all marriage doesn't apply to them? They defined marriage for themselves and decided a meaning for it that applies to them. Of course it doesn't sit well with some people but does that mean that it doesn't apply? And no, like you said, there are no true christians but there are no untrue christians either. That is my point.","1312156830"

This idea persisted right into the middle ages when some theologens still debated weather or not Cannibals could be saved. Some took the position that the bodies of cannibles had been stolen (in bite sized peices) from other humans, and hence could not be ressurected.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","I don't have a review, so I've not seen the insides of that version of the psu, but I do know the Antec Basiq b500U was okay. The platform for the orginal was FSP and they make various average psu's. They won't blow up your system is what I am trying to say.

As far as the one you bought I don't want to say I know what platform it came off but if its one of the newer FSP's then it is decent enough. An example of the newer FSP platform would be [The StealthXtreme 2 from OCZ](http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/OCZ-StealthXStream-2-600-W-Power-Supply-Review/1058/2) which was a pretty nice update to the original StealthXtreme. Once again though without seeing inside that Antec I couldn't tell you if it was or not.
**
So what does it mean if there is no review?** Simply put it could just mean no review samples have been sent to the accepted reviewers. I'll say that much about it as you can speculate why not, but there really is no telling. This happens from time to time that a company will neglect shipping units to decent reviewers, and in some cases they send them to everyone they shouldn't( that happened with Kingwins 1000W gold psu which we had a big discussion about, they eventually did send a review and it turned out okay from what I remember.)

**EDIT:Due to nubbinators post I've found a site that tells me which companies have made which platform. The Platform is from Delta and BP430 which should be the same platform did fairly well, it's just to bad this site isn't in english.**

If I go they are not only losing 1 potential customer they probably lose all the guys I brought with me .

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","You fail to understand little humans. Attention, even negative, is a reward. You must withhold attention when they're bad and give it when they're good.

You can escalate the negative, but short of abuse, very few negatives outweigh the plus of attention.

Inattentive parenting does coincide with that behavior, but that behavior is not always indicative of inattentive (or merely lax) parenting.

Sometimes, you just have to ignore them in public to get this to sink in. Kids are like bureaucrats: their chief interest is controlling you to their own benefit, and they have more time than you do. Your best strategy is to figure out what they really want and use that to get the outcome you want.

Teaching kids manners by coercion doesn't get buy-in from the kid. Like it or not, there's a shelf-life on controlling children. Making them comply is very different from convincing them to comply.

Should you choose to make parenting about force, you'll reap the rewards come teenage years. I humbly suggest that children are needy enough that you have enough tools to get them to behave, at the expense of the sometimes uncomfortable cost of letting them determine that public nagging doesn't work.","1312156893"

Quite the opposite, actually.  Beloved cultural icons are *more* deserving of mockery and ridicule than backwater ideas that nobody actually gives a shit about.

One of the hallmarks of maturity is understanding that ""sacred"" is a subjective concept that some people don't even recognize in the first place.  Another hallmark of maturity is being able to take a joke at your own expense.  You might come up and say that a hallmark of maturity is not offending people on purpose, and you'd have a point if she was telling the joke in a Church or to a person she knew would be overly-sensitive.  But when you're out and about in public it's unreasonable to expect that people will tailor their speech to fit your sensibilities.  The onus is on sensitive adults to avoid speech they might find offensive while in public.","1312156895"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A lot of the experiences that people are posting about are making me scratch my head, because they are so extreme of what what I read and experienced myself. For instance seeing anyone or hearing voices is extreme in and of itself, but actually seeing weird creatures or spiders that try to attack is almost unbelievable. Interestingly enough each culture has their own take on it. For instance in Korea they call it Kwa-wee (sissors) and they explain it with an old story about a virgin bride who died before her wedding. A friend of mine told me that some religious group in Southeast Asia or something reported seeing demons sitting on their chest (a bunch of them mysteriously died in their sleep as well). That is the most extreme case of hallucinating that I had heard of. It makes me want to say that these are not episodes of sleep paralysis, but dreams that are being experienced as they drift back to consciousness. Since so much can happen in a second it wouldn't be unreasonable to assume that these people are waking up from a dream and as more stimuli from their surrounding adds input to their dream world the world is being switched from an environment mainly constructed from the subconscious to a world largely constructed from consciousness. And in this since its more of a semi conscious state. 

When I'm in sleep paralysis I am fully conscious and can look at anything in my room so long as my face is angled the right way. Had I not known about sleep paralysis before I had my first experience with it I would have been freaking out. The only reason I knew about the toe wiggling trick is because I had a friend who said she found an unmarked grave out by her house in middle school. Since then she said that she would sometimes be laying there and all of a sudden not be able to move. She said it would freak her out and then she would just focus on moving a toe and then everything seemed to lift off of her and she would be able to move. So I knew how I was going to get out of it before I even had my first experience. It worked like a charm and I sat up like, ""holy crap that is pretty awesome.""

And since you say that you perceived mobility in your toes and fingers, I want to say that what you experienced there was not an episode of sleep paralysis. If it were you would not be able to move your fingers and toes or feel that you were moving them. As soon as I wiggle a toe even an iota I break free and can sit up and its a struggle to get that toe to move. It isn't easy. Its not like I'm wiggling my toe and then opening my eyes and sitting up. I'm laying there unable to move staring at the ceiling then I wiggle a toe and feel freedom in my entire body and I can move around freely. 

Yea a lot of these descriptions of sleep paralysis aren't really sleep paralysis. ","1312156896"

So instead you'd find thousands of people winning the lottery and only getting slightly more than the cost of the ticket, say. 

Plus small variations in the lottery system will cause different numbers to be pulled out - after the first lottery that a thousand people win, they might look into the ""bimbo of the week"" girl who pulls the lever to start the lottery balls moving about for corruption and temporarily replace her. The replacement might pull the lever half a second later and that would give a completely different result. Butterfly effect and all that...

&gt;But the troops’ commander, Eden Pastora, told a Costa Rican newspaper, La Nacion, that his invasion was not his fault, because Google Maps mistakenly said the territory belonged to Nicaragua. Government officials in Nicaragua have also blamed a “bug in Google” for the error.

However, since Wivenhoe was built, various Governments lowered the official flood risk zone by quite a few metres and allowed land to be sold as prime real-estate that shouldn't have been. 

That in itself shouldn't be a major issue, except that SEQ has had so many people from other states, and the focus on remembering how far the 74 floods has been intentionally removed from the environment.

If somebody is deliberately targeting you, they can easily send you freshly rolled malware that is undetectable by A/V. I haven't been running A/V on Windows in ~10 years and I haven't had a single virus in that period of time.

Use a properly configured firewall. Run software only from trusted sources and always verify the checksum. Keep browser plugins updated (this is the most important!) ie. PDF, Flash, Java, etc. Periodically monitor packets entering and leaving your system to better understand how the software on your machine functions and what it's ""phoning home"" with. Use virtual machines and sanboxing with packet monitoring tools to ""test"" applications you're unsure of.

In summary, anti-virus will protect your perverted grandfather from well known malware he might come across while browsing porn sites, but it's unlikely to be of any real assistance to an IT professional... especially if the malware is specifically targeting their system.

I have also heard that you should leave the bathroom as you came to it. If the seat was down, you should put the seat back down.

The agnostic contributed nothing except trite jokes. The humanist rarely called the theists on their bs. It was basically an hour of televangalism as none of the theists were prepared to disagree with each others' ridiculous conceptions of god, faith, the universe etc. In short, it was a giant theist circlejerk.

Make the front edge of the shelf far enough back that your decorative trim fits entirely between the wall and the vanity - the way that you are holding the trim in the picture will leave the end exposed at the front edge of the vanity and look ""funny"". By pulling the front of the shelf back it will be more invisible.

&gt; You have to remember, in a competitive health care system without government intervention and regulation hospital visits would be relatively cheap, insurance would be cheap and uninsured people could still be covered for emergencies.

I guess perhaps where I am having difficulty is with the concept of a competitive health care system. I feel like one of the failures of the American system is the lack of competition between private insurers and healthcare providers. The response ""Well, get the government out, and competition will take over!"" seems like an overly simplistic response. No one I know really shops around for healthcare insurance, you basically take whatever you are given through your employer. When you are in an emergency, it's not easy to shop around first.

Free market competition makes alot of sense for cell phones or cars, which are easy for me to compare head to head. In the case of healthcare, on the other hand, there seems to be a concerted effort to make it's delivery (via public or private methods) convoluted and difficult to compare. If I extend your line of reasoning, it would seem that without government intervention or regulation, we just have to hope for a Joe Schmoe to come up with a better method of healthcare delivery which is much more suitable to direct competition, and hope that the existing healthcare industry competes fairly with Joe Schmoe.","1312156939"

"islam","t5_2qhbp","&gt;Do Muslims see this constitution as god-give or something good that Muhammad did?

It's both actually. God's commands are contained in the Quran. Muhammad's role as the messenger was to set an example for Muslims. In essence, Quran says *what*, while Muhammad demonstrated *how*.

&gt;Is Muhammad seen as infallible?

No. Emphatically no, Muhammad himself has several quotations denying any infallibility. He was very clear that he was merely a human being. He is known to say that he was not even sure how favourably he will be judged before God once he died. There is a famous event from the battle of Bad'r, when Muhammad formed the ranks to face the enemy, one of the soldiers asked him if the ranks were formed by divine instruction or of his own volition. When Muhammad replied it was of his own volition, the soldier suggested that the entire setup be changed, and Muhammad gladly accepted the new plan. Had he been infallible, it would have been sacrilege to even question his battle plan.

&gt;Do you feel this constitution has been badly implemented where people have tried? Are there a lot of disagreement about interpretation about this?

This is a very complex issue. Islamic tradition for the most part died and was permanently lost after the [Mongol invasion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Baghdad_\(1258\)). Read the article to gauge the extent of intellectual and historic destruction. After that colonial exploitation (Ottomans, British, and French) crushed any chance of recovery and revival. In the absence of education the Muslim world plunged into a dark age, where outsiders became synonymous with enemies, thus ending possibilities of secularism. So long as this distrust exists, a secular Islamic state will be very difficult to establish and very unstable.

[Here](http://www.megavideo.com/?v=AR5TOJJW) is a very recent documentary (episode 2 of 3) made by BBC on the life of Muhammad. At around the 14:00 mark they start discussing the Migration to Medina and the establishment of the Islamic state in Medina. They show points of view from several different Arab and non-Arab sects Christian, Jewish, independent scholars. I would suggest watching.

Edit: The constitution part actually starts at 25:00.","1312156942"

I just left my last GF and it took seven months and some medication before I could even see the hole that I was in. I lived in isolation and pushed my ex beyond my reach. After all that pain, she has finally moved on and now I suffer as I reflect upon my loss. I just made a post on here about it the other day.

I would recommend that you get her to see a psychiatrist who could analyze her for any conditions. A professional could also help you both detect patterns of behaviors and ways to make things better together. I'm not saying that she is bi-polar but whatever she is suffering from, will require a great deal of commitment and understanding from you. If you are up to the challenge, and can get her to go and place effort into this, you will hopefully have a rewarding relationship.

Since I started my medication, I have lost about 30lbs. Some medication may increase weight, but I've made a lot of improvements to my life. I changed my diet, started to exercise, and really have a thrill to succeed. 

If you think that this is too much, I don't think anyone will think less of you for walking out. Hopefully, you two will remain friends and you can continue to help her as she seeks treatment. Remember, treatment for any condition will never work if she isn't committed to getting help. I wish you both the best of luck!","1312156947"

See [this](http://www.moocowproductions.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Screen-Shot-2011-07-21-at-9.53.04-PM.png). Notice how the digital copy (top) often peaks all the way up to 0 dB. The vinyl version does have peaks, but they aren't all at 0 dB.

That's a dynamic range compression at work on the digital copy and has nothing to do with the medium. The mastering engineer for the digital copy decided that it needed to be obnoxiously loud and, in that, he succeeded. But the end result is that the audio almost sounds distorted and un-natural.

Hence why my vinyl copy, regardless of technical limitations of either format, sounds better.

But it's subjective *shrug*. If you like loud, brickwalled, recordings than you would likely prefer the digital. And, to be fair, you can hear everything clearly in the digital version - but it's more like all the instruments are screaming at you.

In the end, I may not be able to convince you, but it doesn't matter. I like I said, it's all subjective.

Based upon the above I will continue, to disagree that a CD rip will always sound better than a vinyl one.","1312156959"

"self","t5_2qh96","I recommend reading [this .pdf file](http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL31967_20100128.pdf) (the link triggers a 1.1MB download), which gives the history and theory of having a debt limit.

The current brouhaha has little to do with the debt limit. The tea baggers claim to want to limit government spending without raising taxes. They have refused to vote on plans to raise the debt ceiling unless the plans include spending reductions, amendments to require balance budgets, and other minutiae which have nothing to do with the debt ceiling. 

In the article I link to, the authors refer to ""the President"" in certain years, without identifying the person holding the office. Let me point out that Clinton was President from 1993 to 2001, at which time there was a budge surplus as stated in more detail in the article. From 2001 to 2009, when the deficits began to grow. These deficits seem to have resulted from the Bush tax cuts and the two wars, which were run ""off the books"" (which is to say without specific funding, just spending the money).

Now, for some reason, a deficit is a horror story for the Republicans and is not to be allowed. No reason has been expressed for this change in attitude toward the deficit now that Obama is in office. Because of their opposition to ""big government"" and deficits, tea baggers will not vote for raising the debt ceiling unless there are unrelated strings attached.

But read the article and draw your own conclusions.","1312156961"

I've found, for myself that an online calorie/exercise counter is the best way to do this. Knowing what you put in your body is essential to knowing when you can abuse it a little bit. If you had a good week, eat something fatty or something sugary. Don't feel guilt, just start the next day fresh and repair the damage. 

Honestly, if you have a cheat day once a week, it's not even going to slow you down. 

Just stop hating yourself. Stop demonizing the food. Maybe cheating once in a while will get you to your goal in 2 years rather than 1, but at least you didn't hate yourself the whole time.

That being said, Silwan is practically in the west bank, I worked with Palestinians every day of those three months. I've spent time in Ashqelon as well, right outside of Gaza. I too know, I'm sure, many more people than you do that live in these areas. I can assure you that the situations in Gaza and the West Bank could be infinitely worse if not for the restraint and humanitarian inclinations of the Israeli government. The situation is undeniably unfortunate, and the multifaceted nature of Israeli political society prevents an easy negotiation with the Palestinians, but it is no way in the Israelis' interests or minds to continue this business of segregation, second class citizenship, and struggle. This all being said, and realizing that the matter is not as simple as ceding all 1967 demarcated land to the Palestinians, being that there are cities and homes built there already (illegally of course, but homes none the less. to evict them against their will would be only a repetition of the original ousting of the Palestinians. if you support such an eye for an eye, violent inhumane act for violent inhumane act mentality, then we are on different pages and will not be able to discuss this further). It is in the interest of both parties to settle so that both are satisfied. It would be unjust to, under the claims of a more than 40 year old demarcation, cede all developed Israeli land to Palestinians. Some compromise must be made, that is certain, and what it is I am no closer to understanding than you. But you must understand that the situation between the Palestinians and Israelis is not one of racial or religious hatred, but a tragic struggle sown in great heartache on both sides. ","1312156972"

Basically for bikes in the same price bracket then age makes a big difference, especially for low end bikes. But the difference between a $300 bike and an $1800 bike is in the type of componentry and quality of the parts. A used high end bike (unless thrashed, of course) will pretty much always give you better performance and last longer than a new low end bike. 

I am much more familiar with the cutoffs in price in the States than here, but there is always a ""price jump"" where you incrementally get better until there is a really big price gap and you make it up to the next level of bike.

For example, in the States at least, anything under about $750 will basically be all low end and there isn't a huge difference between a $300 and a $700 bike. But then you just can't buy much of anything between about $900-1300 and from there you jump up to the next level of bike, where the bottom barrel $1300 bike is vastly better than a top of the line $700 one. 

The bikes I have (1 road, 1 mountain) are up in that next level where the frame itself will last longer, the parts are higher quality and shift better, can take more damage, and are lighter. My road bike is full carbon and has an Ultegra/Dura-Ace buildup - nothing under a grand can touch it (once again, US prices, everything here is much more expensive). 

Also, people with such bikes *tend* to take better care of them (as I do mine) and so you will tend to find cosmetic damage but little in the way of functional damage. 

Bottom line: I think that for your price range, getting a new $500 bike would be better than a used $800 since I think they would be in the same low-end bracket. But a new $800 bike wouldn't compare to my used $1,800 mountain bike or my used $2,700 road bike (now I'm speaking Aussie prices). The question is how much will you be using the bike and what for? These would be massive overkill if you are just going to do short commuter rides, no serious mountaineering, and only put in less than 100-200kms a week. That is why I went with the cheap low end bike at first and quickly realized I needed something more. 

I'll be headed back stateside in November, so I will be selling my bikes here since they are worth more here than back home. If you aren't sure about what you really want to do vis-a-vis your cycling (I was averaging about 500kms a week on my bikes, often more, and a ""normal"" ride for me is 60-100kms at a go on the road or 2-3+ hours of serious single track and climbs on the MTB) then I would say start with a middle of the road low end bike (probably around $400-500 here) and see how you feel about it. If you find yourself cycling a lot and making excuses to go farther and complaining about how long it takes your bike to shift or you feel limited by it, then step up to something better (I finally snapped the chain on my low end bike doing some intense hill climbs and so I bought my high-end bikes). 

If you find your bike to be pretty much meeting your needs and desires, then stick with that and save the money. Otherwise, contact me in a few months time and I will give you a good and reasonable redditor price for what you want (based on Aussie prices, of course) and make sure you get the bike spick-and-span, clean and perfect, and tuned to the tits. :-)","1312156985"

Well, like you said, applying those types of standards--to either religion or science--is not a sound argument to ""disbelieve"" either ""belief.""  

However, I think the line of argument that ""religion is bad for the world"" has more to do with rejecting the institution of religion, rather than its' internal logic.  Rejection does not necessarily mean disbelief--one can be an atheist, but accept the role of religion as a ""net-benefit"" entity, but most atheists tend not to do this, and thus go further in their rejection by a ""cost-benefit"" analysis, like you stated.  

Having said that, I do believe that religion has had a net negative benefit to humanity; today, we see this negative effect taking the form of rejecting scientific solutions to real problems, such as contraceptives, rights for homosexuals, religious freedoms, and scientific research.  Regardless of what the ""majority"" of common religious people think and believe, the institutions that claim governance over them have clearly not acted in either their constituents' best interests, or even according to the philosophies they claim to uphold. 

TL;DR:  This line of argument is more about rejecting the institution of religion, rather than its inner logic.     ","1312156991"

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Well for vectors, doing basic force problems in physics. Note: a is acceleration, v is velocity and p (my variable) is position. For example a = Δv/Δt = F/m - from Newton's second equation - and solving for position as a function of time.  (Here, I'm assuming a and F are vectors, I just don't have a way to implement them without using LaTeX.)

Here's an example: Let the initial velocity and position of our 2 kg particle be 0 and 0 at t = 0. Suppose the force on our particle is (2, -2, 6) N. What is its position as a function of time?

To start off, a = Δv/Δt = F/m = (1, -1, 3).

One of the standard kinematic equations is Δp = v(0)t + .5at^2 . Since v(0) = (0, 0, 0), we can easily find what Δp is. (Here, Δp is the overall change in position, so it contains information about the x, y and z components.) This equation assumes that a is not a function of position or time, though. If it is, you have to employ different techniques.

If we input what a is in our equation, we get Δp = (0, 0, 0)t + .5(1, -1, 3)t^2 = (.5 t^2 , -.5 t^2 , 1.5 t^2 ) = p(t) - p(0). But since p(0) = (0, 0, 0), we get p(t) = (.5 t^2 , -.5 t^2 , 1.5 t^2 ).

So if we wanted to know where our particle is as a function of time, we would just have to plug in for t.

That's a pretty standard example. There can be more complicated ones (like those dealing with magnetic fields), but that should get the idea across. I'll comment below on some stuff with complex numbers and trig.","1312157009"

You rub it on nightly at first, usually under armpits, hands and feet (it'll itch when you first start using it) and shower in the morning. After a few uses you'll see increasingly less sweating. After a year you may see little to no sweating with uses numbering a few times or less a month.

More on money:  
Visa &amp; Master Card are accepted essentially everywhere.  Card readers here use the magnetic stripe, not the chip+pin system.

Most ATMs dispense $20's, so people regard $50's and $100's with suspicion.  Some shops will refuse to accept large bills (typically gas stations &amp; fast-food places) for fear of counterfeits.  Cards not from that ATM's owner will be charged about $3-5 per transaction.

Instead of carrying a large wad of cash around, perhaps consider getting a few [Visa gift-cards,](http://usa.visa.com/locators/gift-card-locations.jsp) and splitting some of your money up between them.  Then you can carry one in your shoe or otherwise hidden, in case of emergency.

This idea persisted right into the middle ages when some theologens still debated weather or not cannibals could be saved. Some took the position that the bodies of cannibles had been stolen (in bite sized peices) from other humans, and hence could not be ressurected.

The main thing is to not do things that take a lot of energy, you will be hungry but try keep yourself busy reading religious books, meditate, contemplate on how those who are born into situations where they have little food, pray, make goals to do good (make someone smile, give charity, etc). 

Again expanding on what shurf said, keep going, it will be difficult and most of the time that difficulty is in the mind. Be disciplined and keep going as long as you are healthy enough, and its not effecting you too negatively. 

Wish you all the best. Peace be with you. :)

I've gone back and forth on this issue throughout my life. I think for me, since life turned out pretty well, i'd be scared to erase that part of my life or do it over. Like, if I had a genie with 3 wishes, I wouldn't want to change that part of my life. I went through it, I came out of it, and it's made me a better person. There are other things that I would probably change (like not binge partying my senior year so much and starting to party a lot early. also, wearing earplugs to concerts b/c damn my hearing is starting to go :) But no, I wouldn't change the traumatic bits. 

I also found that it definitely shaped the type of girls that I'm attracted to. And I also feel like I intimately understand why girls are sometimes attracted to abusive boyfriends (the whole love hate thing as well as a multitude of other things that I can go into detail about if ppl are interested).

Would I put myself through that again? Hell no.

But, at the same time, I feel like that's a cop out b/c I'm one of the exceptions (I presume) where it did all work out. So to geek out on you, the question we're contemplating Probability( being awesome | fucked upringing) = 100%, would you willingly partake in fucked upringing? Most people would say yes to that. But the scary part is we don't know what P(fucked up 4 life | fucked upbringing).

"culturalstudies","t5_2qhwb","I am going to attempt to your answer your questions the way I practice cultural studies. Its a POV and that's about it.

1. How is this true or accurate or valid? 
A. True/Valid/Accurate for whom? Who's asking this question? What I mean by that answer is - Is it the hegemon who is attempting to validate the truth claim, if that is the case, what makes something true for the hegemon is not true, valid or accurate for the subaltern.

2. How does inquiry not create it's own truth and descend into impose a collection of personal, subjective ideology into the world? 
A. Identity politics produces one's subject position. And it is from within that subject position that all articulations of theory are done. Therefore, class, race, gender, religion, ability, etc. suture into the critical discursive paradigm. Texts produced with this self-awareness open up new avenues of critical engagement. Said, Spivak, Butler, Haberstam, all are aware of their subject positions and deliberate from that point of reference.

3. Why should this be important? In that it appears that the mind can imagine possibilities what makes this an examination and not expression?'
A.  ""Malcolm X said: Racism is like a Cadillac, there is a new model every year."" ISAs &amp; RSAs are consistently being reworked, revised, rejuvinated. It doesn't take much to get sublimated into the mainstream.","1312157070"

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","Flirting isn't hard once you wrap your head around it. It's basically just showing the person you're talking to that you're interested. One example of how to flirt that I like to fall back on is asking topical questions. The ""what's a girl like you doing in a place like this"" route. It shows that you're interested in learning more about her. Start with small questions like ""how are you?"" and ""what are your interests?"" and branch out from there. Focus on her, and be genuine in your questions. Ask questions that you're interested in knowing the answer to. And if don't have any questions that you're interested in knowing the answer to, chances are she's not that interesting to you to begin with. 

Another flirting technique that I think you confused with 'making fun of' is simple playful banter. Banter doesn't mean making fun of her or anything related to her, though. It's just about cracking jokes. 

Also, a really good one is just fitting in compliments. If she asks how you are, say something along the lines of ""I'm always great when I'm talking to someone so beautiful"". If it sounds corny, then you're probably on the right track. *Everyone* likes to hear that they are attractive. *Everyone* likes knowing that someone likes their company. 

Body language is big, too. Make eye contact when you're talking to her or when she is talking. She should be the center of your attention. Smile and enjoy her company. Maybe even fit in a small amount of touching (a hug, a touch to her arm or the small of her back, whatever comes up contextually). 



Back to the sleeping around thing, though. It's just like you said. There's a really fine line that women have to walk if they want to sleep around and not be labelled a slut. A lot of women just avoid those situations all together, or embrace it and just end up attracting all the wrong guys. So you can't really get offended when a girl doesn't want to sleep with you, eh? Either way, it sounds more like you need a real relationship, anyways. ","1312157090"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I just went through this a little over a year and a half ago, with someone I was engaged to and living with.  My grieving/recovery went something like this:


**Month One:**  

* Move out of his house and into a house with single women.  
* Cut off all communication with him as I was too hurt/upset to have any semblance of a rational conversation.
* Read Twilight novels in my jammies on the porch while drinking beer.  This was helpful in that it took little brain power and I could sit there and do it for hours at a time.  I basically got home at 4 PM every day and put on my pajamas after work.
* Play sappy love songs on the guitar.
* Cry
* Take lots of cry breaks at work.
* Avoid doing things where crying would be a problem.


**Month 2:**

* Stop crying
* find a friend who has recently been through something similar and once in awhile cry on each others shoulders
* Develop a new hobby...I chose going out to see live local music.  This also allowed me to meet other music lovers that I could hang out with when I wanted to leave the house even though I wasn't ready to date at all.


**Months 3-12:**

* Do something you always wanted to do but were too chicken to try...in my case...archery (or didn't have time to do because you were too busy being a girlfriend to someone).
* Hit the gym or whatever else causes you to release endorphins.
* Take your time doing everything and relish in the fact that you are no longer a slave to someone else's schedule.
* Watch every stupid chick flick/art film that you ever wanted to see.
* Practice the art of self pleasure.
* Come to accept the fact that you would not have been happy with that person in the long term, and be glad you cut your losses early on.  If you have to, hang out with them a few times and remember why it is over.


**Months 13-20:**

* Start regaining interest in dating, but lose it continuously as men continue to be interested in only superficial things and your emotional wall is still up sky high.
* Accept the fact that being single forever has its advantages.


**Month 21-22:**

* Realize that in order to meet a kind, like-minded person, you have to go somewhere that kind, like-minded people are...in my case a college reunion.
* Heal enough to find a new friend and cautiously contemplate giving this whole relationship thing another go.

In Canada, it's very rare to see someone driving completely legally. That's because of the overuse of stop signs, and overly restrictive speed limits. Plus the driver training isn't required - if you have ten bucks you can get your learners permit and possibly go on to get your licence.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","In an east asian cultural context, it would be quite rude for this kind of eye contact. To quote from wikipedia ""In some parts of the world, particularly in Asia, eye contact can provoke misunderstandings between people of different nationalities. Keeping direct eye contact with a work supervisor or elderly people leads them to assume one is being aggressive and rude — the opposite reaction of most Western societies."" To quote from about.com ""Eye Contact in Most Asian, African and Latin American Cultures

Extended eye contact can be taken as an affront or a challenge of authority.

Generally, only sporadic or brief eye contact is considered acceptable. This is particularly true in Asian cultures where people are from different professions or social levels. For example, in China and Japan, children show respect to elders by not making intense eye contact; employees would not make eye contact with employers; students would not force eye contact with teachers, etc.

These cultures do not view avoiding looking someone in the eyes as rude or disinterested, or even as necessarily being submissive. Instead, avoiding eye contact is usually interpreted as being simply being polite or reverent.""

To me, it seems absolutely backwards to force eye contact in this way. But I suppose that's coming from a different culture.","1312157116"

Anarchists also believe that truly anti-social crimes like assault, rape, and murder would also dramatically decrease in a society with less domination and institutional violence. What little anti-social crime that remained would be dealt with in a variety of ways, from accountability processes, to restorative justice, to vigilante actions and citizen's militias.

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","From what I've learned, dizziness is governed by three inputs: vestibular, visual, and somatosensory.  The vestibular system, in large part because it utilizes the force of gravity, acts as a tiebreaker when the other two sources of information are conflicting.

So, while on a boat, your somatosensory system sends the ""we're not moving"" signal (based on input saying you are, in fact, standing/sitting still), while your visual system is sending information saying ""we're moving"" (based on the apparent motion that the boat causes.)  So, now, the vestibular system has to figure out what is really going on.  What happens next? Unfortunately, like many problems regarding our neuroanatomy, this ends in a cliffhanger.  A couple conflicting theories.

In the long run, teaching CC might be a viable route to look at. But even in good economic times, we'd get hundreds of legitimate, fully-completed application packets for each tenure-track position. And for our adjunct faculty, we already have a really, really long waiting list.

"iphone","t5_2qh2b","greetings98 basically has it covered, but just a few things I want to add:

Google Sync allows you to set up your Google Account on your iPhone just like an Exchange account (if you're familiar with that). Basically, it syncs email, contacts, and calendar via the Exchange protocol so all your Google account data is all synced with your iPhone (if you make a change on your iPhone, it's reflected on your Google account and vice-versa). Another cool thing about using Google Sync on your iPhone is that it enables push Gmail and Google Calendar so you don't have to worry about fetching the latest data.

Another important thing to note is that the iPhone is a relatively closed device out of the box. A lot of the features and customization that you have grown accustomed to in your Android device, will not be available on the iPhone (or will be severely dumbed down). That being said, I think the iPhone UI is much more smooth and unified because of this.

You can also jailbreak your device (I have and it's great) to get a lot more out of it, but beware, it does take some reading to learn how to do the cool stuff.","1312157141"

Look into your motivations here, and you'll probably find feelings quite analogous to those which motivate atheists to be outspoken.

Though I am a native English speaker, I never paid attention to anything in class (which I deeply regret) and can only feel if something sounds right from my years of reading.

Music-box 

Dreams come, those of little truth and much fantasy.  Real people and friends imagined.  Loves won, or almost so.  Most I try to hold onto, as I would escape this cage of present, but threads woven so strong and thick during sleep stretch tight and fray, eventually snapping under the pressure of the conscious mind.  Some are strong, though, they fight, threads holding by a single strand, allowing the memories to be recalled in some rare moments.  That is for most dreams.  This one, though, had not one thread but dozens, all tight, none breaking, and all pulsing.

I awoke with a breeze through the window, and the sun flashing my face, as the tree limbs moved.  I felt it in my head, something colorful and light, dark and sinister.  A few notes came to me, and unconsciously I hummed them.  They felt magnificent but empty.  It was missing, the rest was missing.  Emptily I looked around and with a fuzzy mind dressed in the same clothes I had worn last night.  I did this out of rote, not because I knew it was needed.  I entered the kitchen and in my zombie state set out to make a meal of some cereal.  As I picked up a spoon I stopped and dropped it.  The clatter, it needed the clatter.  I picked up the spoon and started to hum.  When I felt it was right, knew it was right, I dropped the spoon again.  Grace filled me as I felt the movement of sound continue, but within that second it stopped.  I had made more of it, discovered some of the truth, but not enough.

Forgetting all things now except the tune, I rushed out.  No shoes on my feet, no lock on the door.  I hummed it over and over.  People looked, they talked, more notes came.  The gravel bit my soft feet, but the bursting of my soles was far outweighed by the sounds in my soul that came.  Still I hummed louder, occasionally singing nonsense and uttering sounds, for they fit.  Something almost hit me, a car I think it was, but all I could hear was the honk and the feel of hands pushing me down onto grass, wet grass, that added a soft melody.  Someone was talking, my eyes showed potbellied and blue.  He grabbed me and I sung the blue, the potbelly, and all.  He was taking me and I felt an urge to go.  The world spoke, and it was added.  We climbed the steps to a building I had known before, but now was just a deep bass feel.  He hauled me up.  The doors opened, the sounds went wild.  I could barely see, or feel, or hear anything but the grand melody before me.  I did catch one bit, a clink.  I remembered bars that made such a sound from shows, from before, but that was gone now.  I was hearing it all, the human sound.  The reek and dirt, such sad and empty notes.  But beneath it all I heard heartbeats and hope.  This brought the tune to a glorious conclusion, a masterful pronouncement of all human feeling.  The last beat, the last note; my heart grew quiet, my breath leaked the last wheezing sound.  It was done.","1312157152"

I'm by no means an expert as I was in your position only a few years ago, but I'll have a go at trying to help.  [This](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/e41q3/when_people_claim_insert_league_name_here_is_the/) is a good introduction to the different leagues in Europe.  The EPL seems to get a bit more coverage here in the States, so you'll have a good chance to see games if you go to a good sports bar.  See if there is a place nearby that is open for games, which is becoming more and more common in the States these days, and have a pint or two early on weekend mornings

As for choosing a team in the EPL, [this](http://www.reddit.com/tb/j3pgd) is meant more as a joke, but it's not a bad place to start.  The best advice is to just start watching as many games as possible and you'll start to get a feel for the teams.  This isn't something you have to choose overnight.

I also really recommend getting involved with a nearby MLS team.  I'm assuming you're from the west coast, and there are some really great fan bases out your way.  Watching the games on your computer is one thing, but watching games with fellow fans is quite another.","1312157153"

"travel","t5_2qh41","&gt;I hate that I am in a way giving into societal pressures to obtain this piece of paper which yes could help me. But it more so makes me feel like a sellout. I don't want or need to have all the luxuries and shit that I am so used to in this society, nor do I really want to be stuck on a straight career path for my whole life.

The diploma is not really what gets you hired; its everything that you learn on the way. The piece of paper is most just an affirmation that you have what it takes to get through the curriculum, and you have done everything that the university has required of you. Hopefully that includes useful skills and experiences that can get you hired. You won't be a sellout if you study hard, build your skillset, and establish yourself as a competent up-and-coming professional in your field. 

That having been said, there's no reason why you can't incorporate your love of travel and knowledge into your career. I count myself extremely luck that I can travel as a part of my job and that I do something I love and find rewarding. I would hate having to work menial jobs that I have no interest in just to fund my travels. But that's just me. I also wouldn't like doing nothing but traveling, even if everything was paid for.

As for balancing your education and your desire to travel, school is actually much more flexible than a real life job. Summer break, winter break, spring break, study abroad, etc. That's much more than you'll get with full time jobs in the US. A little travel also goes a long way. Even a short trip can be very fulfilling and can tide you over until the next trip. And you can always explore your own country in the mean time. 

Lastly, about your point about having all the luxuries and shit: I understand where you are coming from and I've wrestled with it myself. However, this is important: Don't make things difficult because you think it will make things more real or authentic. People around the world who absolutely hate the US will still give up everything they have for a chance to go there. For someone who has all that to just dismiss it all as ""selling out"" can be seen as spitting in their face. People will respect you if you try to understand them, and they will be grateful for your love of their country, but do not romanticize their poverty or misfortune. ","1312157181"

The project also had three big media events (two podcasts and one print article) that were rescheduled for dates past the funding deadline - which had a major impact on getting the word out.

&gt;I am accepting a position at a major tech company but will still be working on Morningstar.  However a release will take a lot longer than originally scheduled since I will have very limited time to put into the project and my paying job will take priority.

"Autos","t5_2qhr3","Keeping your engine too cold can also cause [problems](http://www.jalopyjournal.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-23677.html).

When an engine runs cold so does its lubricating oil, which means more potential for moisture and acid to form in its oil. At higher temps (both oil and engine) harmful deposits are boiled off. This prevents the slow destruction of bearing material and shortened engine life.
When an engine runs too cold, the fuel economy goes down, often way down. A decrease of 6 to 10 miles per gallon isn’t unusual and as fuel consumption increases so does wear. Wear increases because of two factors. First, the cold engine doesn’t heat the oil sufficiently and harmful deposits, moisture, and acid accumulate rapidly, then eat away at the inside of your engine. 

There is actually more friction in a motor that is 20 degrees too cool, 
than one which is 20 degrees too hot.



Water/methanol injection really helps with turbo motors.  The high pressure/high temp air can be a real problem for detonation.","1312157196"

"sex","t5_2qh3p","It's not that thick on most women. It tends to be pretty thin. If a girl has a thick one it might need to be broken by a doctor. 

Many girls actually break it before having sex (inserting tampons, playing sports, masturbating, etc). And when it happens like that it doesn't tend to cause pain. Fingering will definitely break it if it's not one of the really thick ones. It's located close to the opening of the vagina. There's no harm in breaking it by a certain age or anything. 

The girls that still have it in tact when they become sexually active either break it through fingering/oral or penetrative sex. If you go straight to penetrative sex without warming her up first and making sure she's really wet, then it will cause pain. The discomfort most girls feel when they lose their virginity is more about their vaginal walls being stretched out more than they have before. But again, if they're well lubricated, properly warmed up with foreplay and relaxed, it should not be *painful*. ","1312157196"

Then there's everything from doctors and ballerinas to engineers and IT specialists who live abroad for the better pay (including the US and Canada). Also worth mentioning are the thousands of Romanian students in Western universities. Most of the ""begging and stealing"" is done by the Gypsy community (2.5% of the population here, but a greater part of the diaspora carrying Romanian passports), who are nomadic by nature and travel around Europe. Their community usually has no stable means of subsistence because they refuse to send their children to school, to at least farm, work daily jobs or be a part of society in general. Basket weaving and iron collection only get them so far. They have Romanian citizenship because they were born here, but other than that have nothing in common with the Romanian people, ethnically, culturally or otherwise. There are of course ethnic Romanians doing crime abroad, as there are here in the country, but labeling us as beggars and thieves because of the acts of a particular community that we share our land with is taking it a tad too far.

However, we aren't concerning ourselves with views otherwise divorced from the context of political and social implementations. Lenin was placed in a unique positon where he could implement his views. His implentations sucked. It's not a bridge to far to consequently reason that this bodes strongly for his views sucking as well.

You can also make a relatively convincing argument that Hitler's nationalism and military re-arming had a massively positive and measurable effect on the German economy post Versailles.

I never got any kind of encouragement and it did make me lose track and lose motivation.  That is why I think I could never stick with anything.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","The boundries of a web designer and a web developper overlap. Mostly, because there are way too few actual web designers.

Think of the designers of a car. They need to have a lot of understanding of aerodynamics. They need to know regulation and rules. They don't need to know how to make an engine. But a random sketch car, is not a usable design in any sense.

** a print designer **

Photoshop -&gt; Slicing -&gt; HTML/CSS 

If this describes your proccess, please don't use the word 'web' in any part of your skillset. You are doing print design and then shoehorning it onto an alien platform. You may be a very good print designer, you are not a web designer, let alone a web developer. 

In the industry, this person is known as a 'print designer'.

** A web designer **

You set up CSS style sheets, and manage the assets and the creative proccess. You develop a visual language, and provide, using the assets and CSS the vocabulary of your visual language. 

You know your typography. You set up a font grid. You pick fonts with knowledge of how they will look on different devices. (without or without anti-aliasing) You pick colors knowing that they will not look the same on every device.

You build your mockups in HTML/CSS, and you consider simple user interaction design (what happens to links when a user hovers, where do scrollbars go?), how does a user navigate, what happens when the browsers get resized, what happens on a mobile device .. part of your exploration phase. Your explore within the realm of reality. Web is not print. Things never look the same same anywhere, and not everything you would want is possible. But without a full understanding of what is possible, and what the trade-offs are, you are not equipped to make any of these decisions. 

You use graphical tools to create gradients, icons, logo's .. but you use HTML/CSS to compose them and their interaction. This is the place where you actual explore and create your mockups. You validate that the mockup actually works in all these contexts. And you provide arguments for the trade-offs you've made. You can estimate how much roundtrip the core layout requires, and how much data has to be transferred on a 'cold visit'. You may use a little javascript to add some subtle optional animations. This is the type of demonstration you provide your clients. That is the type of responsibility you take on.

If you are also actually good at design, then you are a web-designer and are worth a fortune.
If you are not good at design, you are called a front-end programmer. (these are usually underpaid kids that help shoehorn an alien print design into a website, because they can't find an actual web designer)

** You are a web developper **

You write server-side code, perhaps some temporary CSS/HTML. You know how to setup a database, you know how to manage your servers. How to run backend tasks, if needed. You work with the requirements of the application, and more importantly of the whatever part of the application needs to be managed by the customer itself. Your solutions range from completely unique infrastructure to effectively reusing CMS like components. You understand SEO, syndication. You know how to properly hash a password. You have knowledge of all these protocols and standards. 

You can guide and support a web designer or front-ender, when they come accross a lack of technical knowledge. You can provide them with some profiling assistence, some workarounds. More generally, your skillset when it comes to debugging is offered to them. (because they likely have more alpha brains, than beta brains and may need it from time to time)

In the industry, this is considered to be a back-end programme'. If they can also also do front-end work, you may also call them web-developpers. (but that word is kind of overused)

&gt; In fact I don't even know the boundaries.

The boundries don't exist in the problem domain, they exist in the skills in the people. They are 'limitations' of specific and collectives of individuals. Somehow a feeling for design, and technical excellence don't go hand in hand. So, to work around this limitation, the fields have to overlap.

**People that fit, straight in the middle of that overlap between technical requirements and knowledge of design are worth a fortune.**

1. handbrake method--apply handbrake, apply gas, let clutch out until you feel the car lurching forward, release handbrake. I never use this method. It's complicated. It does mostly guarantee not stalling and not rolling backward on the hill.

2. Sit with your foot on the brake. When the light turns green, apply ~ half-throttle (YMMV, enough to get it to 3k rpm is good usually) while releasing the clutch through its first 25% rather quickly. You will roll back at most 3-4"" and even that is unlikely. If your car has more power than typical, you don't need as much gas. Opposite if it's low-powered.

It's REALLY not that hard if your car has plenty of torque (like in the mustang example, or I drive a new GTI).

I learned manual on my car by driving it around in the suburbs for a few hours until I started to get the hang of it. You'll be fine! :) It's totally worth it!

The only problem is that you can't really test drive a manual car when you can't drive manual. In this case, if possible, drive the closest automatic version and read the reviews on how good the manual trans is in the car.

While I'm an insider with an intimate connection to the issue and you're an outsider with less at stake and less intimate knowledge 

America has some major problems.  Most of those major problems derive directly from our adoption of liberal European policies.  I might have considered the chance that we've just been doing wrong if much of Europe wasn't struggling for continued existence.  It appears there's a 50-50 chance the European Union will crumble under the weight of their unfunded consumption.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Craig argues something like this. God is the ultimate metaphysical concept and exists uncaused as a necessity of His own existence. I think the line of reasoning goes like this(my opinion mind you): Things exist, you, me, the universe. Everything that exist has a cause in a line of progression back to God. Nothing can be greater than God because He is the metaphysical ultimate. Since nothing can be greater than God and we can work a chain of causality back to Him, He must be the end of the chain and exist un-caused necessarily (because we know other stuff exists.)

To counter this I would argue that we don't know what the ultimate POSSIBLE metaphysical concept is. Maybe Steven Hawking's primordial vacuum that spawns the multiverse is the ultimate POSSIBLE metaphysical concept and exists un-caused. Give it a cool name like All Void or Masterverse and we've got something to compete with God.","1312157238"

Given the current candidates, I didn't even think I was going to vote at all. I decided to start reading this Summer. I was suggested to read works by, who many people believe to be the greatest political thinkers of the last century, Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky. I didn't want to stop there, I've even read the Communist Manifesto and Mein Kampf. 

Not stopping there, I began reading from the age of enlightenment, with thinkers including Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Jefferson, John Locke, Montisquieu, and Thomas Paine. 

Even from there, it seemed the more I read, the further back in time I read. I am currently reading Plato. It feels that what he wrote 2,000+ years ago is still relavent today. 

If you want to take this seriously, you need to read and learn as much as you possibly can. I recommend that you do the opposite of what I did and read from Plato to the enlightenment to Ayn Rand and Noam Chomsky. Hope I helped.","1312157243"

Strikes me as ridiculous.  Canada is the USA's backyard resource (oil, gas, uranium, etc) supplier.  If the USA is willing to let that slip through its fingers, it's because the USA is no longer *capable* of defending it.

I also like dudley's elementary number theory book and I do enjoy elementary number theory, but I feel that a little bit of abstract algebra makes many of the proofs much prettier. In particular euler's theorem is immediate with a little bit of group theory if you just prove that Z_n^* is a group under multiplication, which isn't hard. ","1312157251"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Europe recovered from WWI, at least materially, and in any case they'd already been outstripped by the US before the war. Psychologically, well, that was up to them, and they dropped the ball. A generation later they were unwilling to lift a finger to stop Germany, and that's entirely their fault. This is where Keynes comes in; I didn't mean his economic policies (which I largely agree with), I meant his assault on Versailles that completely discredited the treaty as vicious and barbaric. This is a huge part of the reason why no one really cared when Germany started tearing up clause after clause. The truth is that Versailles really wasn't that bad; in fact, it was far too light, since it allowed the German 'stab-in-the-back legend' to grow. And the fact that Germany and Japan did great after WWII despite far worse war damage and treaty sanctions illustrates this. So in short, by failing to handle Germany both at the end of the war and in the following decades, which was absolutely their responsibility, Europe dropped the ball and enabled itself to be torn apart in a more lasting way from 1939 on, burying the notion that it was still a power center and catapulting the US to the front.

And secondly, Latin America has never been a powerhouse and it won't be for the foreseeable future. The only nation that even has long (*very* long)-term potential to be a global power is Brazil, and it's got a long way to go. Historically, Latin America has been an excellent example of what to avoid, and certainly never an alternative power center to Europe or the US.

Of course America is an imperialist power, and is very good at it, given that as you've pointed out, we defeated or outproduced every rival we've had. But in 1500, it was hardly obvious Europe would utterly dominate the world in a few centuries. And in 1800, it was probably even less obvious that America would rise to become the richest nation on earth in less than a century. These cultures succeeded because of their own merits, and also because competing cultures that might have been global powerhouses (China, Russia, India, the Ottoman Empire, etc) tried to succeed and failed. 

So my point is that, while the debt limit talks reveal some of the worst of American politics, the reason this is such a bad thing for the world is that America is the richest, most powerful, and generally greatest nation on earth. And that's true not only because of our own merits but because the very nations criticizing us fucked up their own chances to compete. (And this is an incidental point but probably still important: take the beam out of your own eye, citizens of the world. America hardly has a monopoly on political dysfunction.)

Are you aware that the scope of the federal government's functions have changed drastically in the last couple centuries?  I suggest you read up on the commerce clause.  Again, [this](http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html) is what Hamilton had in mind at the time when extolling the virtues of federalism.  Yes, Publius was arguing for an unprecedented expansion of the central government's functions.

The project also had three big media events (two podcasts and one print article) that were rescheduled for dates past the funding deadline - which had a major impact on getting the word out.

&gt;I am accepting a position at a major tech company but will still be working on Morningstar.  However a release will take a lot longer than originally scheduled since I will have very limited time to put into the project and my paying job will take priority.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","In the past, I've seen the mistaken assumption that Uighurs are the majority in XinJiang.  People usually make the mistake because it fits their narrative that the Uighurs are the rightful owners of the region.  It's similar to how they feel about Tibet.  In fact, that Uighurs are not the majority in the province of XinJiang shouldn't be of much concern regarding their demands for independence.  The borders of XinJiang are an artificial creation of the Chinese government, which has spent the last 50 years aggressively colonizing XinJiang with Han Chinese and using other tricks to cement their claim, as they do in Tibet.

None of this changes the fact that the BBC, IMO, has a dangerous anti-China bias which not only threatens the accuracy of their reporting, but it sometimes hands easy propaganda victories to hardcore Chinese nationalists.

IMO, the BBC, which I otherwise love and respect, hasn't properly atoned for its sloppy coverage of the Tibetan riots of 2008.  They weren't the worst offenders, but they took part in a lot of bad reporting and outright fabrication of events that was occurring across the Western media.  It was so blatant that the Chinese government and its supporters were able to turn the Tibet riots into a propaganda victory by slamming the hypocrisy of the 'free' Western media.  Websites like [anti-cnn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-cnn), which no longer exists in its original form, are still famous in China for exposing the lies and causing Chinese people to reconsider the objectivity of foreign mainstream media.","1312157284"

"bestof","t5_2qh3v","Heads up to folks: I use some graphic and potentially triggering examples in this response.

Here we go:

&gt;You can't choose whether to be punched. I can choose not to take offence at mere words, and if I can choose not to take offence, that means taking offence is inherently a choice as well.

This statement is, perhaps, the very heart of this entire controversy.  So I want to treat it with importance and the rigor that it deserves.

There are countless mechanisms at play in that statement, but I'll focus here on the two I feel are most general and significant:

1- The unfortunate truth is that there are many, many people who do *not* have the choice of not being offended.  For example, if you're a rape survivor, and someone tells you, for instance, ""I hope you get raped"" (it happens), it could damn well cause a full-on fucking breakdown, if not at the very least a devastating panic attack.  This is not a ""choice"" - this is [a function of neurology and physiology](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Panic_attack).  And while that is an extreme example, it has countless variants of infinite degrees, though such extremes are more common than you might think.

Now, granted, it's likely that ""most"" people on the internet have the *privilege* of choosing not to be offended (more on that in a moment).  But it's only just that - a privilege.  Those are the people who do not battle Post-Traumatic Stress every day of their lives; the people who aren't desperate just to have a space that they feel safe to participate in, when so many spaces are not.

As for the idea that such ""sensitive"" folks are the exception to the rule, either on the internet or off, I offer some food for thought: if they were actually quite common, and were driven away from forums and other spaces, *how would we ever know that that had happened?*

2- The other significant mechanism is a lot more subtle, and a lot harder to quantify.  It involves the overall atmosphere of a space, and how that affects the people who use it, and who those people end up being.

Indeed, it's a concept that most of us here are already familiar with - redditors like to call it ""the hive mind.""  But what *is* the hive mind, and how did it come to be?

Some stereotypical qualities of redditors who are a part of ""the hive mind"": liberal, atheist, educated, geeky, skeptical, anti-police brutality, etc.  Indeed, these qualities (and many others) reflect a few overwhelming trends of the community here.

So what happens when someone who *isn't* like that comes to reddit for the first time?  Or when they make their first submission on a topic that isn't popular with ""the typical redditor""?  Where, I ask, are all the /r/politics submissions from the 50% or so of Americans that favor the Republican party?

The answer is simple.  They've been excluded - driven off, in a sense (though of course not deliberately, in most cases) - by the very momentum that the community has already established.  They might go to the front page of /r/politics and be so turned off, that they decide right then and there that this isn't a space that will give legitimacy to their concerns.  And they don't really come back.

So what happens when, instead of our hypothetical Republican caught in /r/politics, we have a transgender woman who wants to talk about anarchism?  What if they go to /r/anarchism, and get really excited about some of the submissions there, only to go to the comments and find something like **[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/j1qgh/nipples/c28pkze)**?  What would you do, in that position?  Probably leave in disgust, and not come back.  And I wouldn't blame you.

Through this mechanism the global, diverse crowd becomes more and more selectively weeded through, leaving behind only that homogenous few that consistently feels comfortable in that space.  And so, the submissions become less interesting, the viewpoints less diverse, and the equality of the space overall gets further and further down the toilet.

It is that trend which /r/anarchism (and its open, revolving team of moderators) seeks to challenge; to make the subreddit a safe, diverse, and accessible place for all kinds of people - because we truly seek to minimize oppression, in any context, and see a world where people of *all* kinds are empowered.

There's a time to ignore them (even in public), a time to remove them from the situation (time out in front of the store), and a time to actually address their question. Most difficult is that the right choice depends on the age of the child more than the situation (answer at 2, ignore at 3, time out at 4, etc).

It's all about attention being a reward, allowing children to test limits, and knowing what a child is capable of understanding at a given age.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Maokai.

Maokai is a tank, AP assassin, and farmer/pusher all rolled into one.  (Or, if you're Chu, he's a bruiser)

I think he's incredible with a team that knows to stand IN THE CIRCLE, and great even if your team insists on charging in without your initiation.  Saplings are free wards, and they can clear the caster creeps in one throw from level 6 or so on, making your CS rival your AD carries, which is hilarious.

I go Doran's, Doran's, Merc Treads, Shroud, Abyssal, which is cheap enough to keep buying wards all game, and allows you to upgrade to FH, get Banshee's and a Sheen by the end of the game, at which point you are dishing out incredible damage.  I stood and laughed at a Caitlyn with this build because her shots just tickled me.  With my ult on I literally had time to type ""Ooooooh, that feels good, Cait"" in all chat before EWQing her, blowing my ult, and making her run away.

Optional items are: 

* Haunting Guise, it is cheap and has three useful stats, HP, AP, MPen.

* RoA, if you get it early this is really handy.  If I get first blood I sometimes grab this, but otherwise, too costly.

* Morello's Evil Tome, don't get if you're going glacial, you'll have over the max CDR.  I prefer glacial, but a more offensive Maokai might grab this.

* Rylai's, expensive, I only get this if nobody else has slow so I can slow with my saplings.  Every W is followed by a Q anyways.  

* Aegis, it is nice to have on your team, but you're not starved for resists at all, so honestly, I let another player get this usually, but it isn't expensive, so make sure somebody has it.

Maokai trick:  Don't get your ult until level 10 (or before Glacial Shroud is my rule of thumb), you can't keep it on very long, and you often won't be in a situation to help your team with it.  Better to keep getting ranks of sapling to one-shot the caster creeps.","1312157304"

"motorcycles","t5_2qi6d","If you have a lot of sand and dust, you'll need to clean your chain more often than you need to tighten it. I use an old toothbrush and a coffee can with some kerosene. You can reuse it, the crud will settle to the bottom. Scrub the chain, wiping with a rag and moving the bike forward (if you don't have a center stand) so you get the whole chain. Take the cover off the front gears (sorry, don't know the name) and clean in there too. Wipe the chain down with a dry rag, then go have a beer while the remaining kerosene evaporates.

I prefer grease over the spray on waxy stuff. Glob on a bit with your fingers, making sure the rollers are all able to move. Wipe off the excess, leaving just enough to coat the chain. You don't want to leave any blobs, or they will fling all over your bike and your boots.

When you tighten the chain, leave about an inch of play in it - measure this at the bottom center of the chain. The best way I've found to make sure the chain is straight is to get down and look along the bottom of the chain from the rear sprocket towards the front of the bike.

Two things that will definitely make your chain noisy are when it's loose (kind of a clackity sound) or if it's crooked.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","I would suggest approaching any muslims you know or any muslims groups on campus. Keeping and breaking a fast as part of a group may be more revealing.

If you are a caffeine addict, I would suggest lowering your intake on the days before any fast in order to lower the chances of withdraw.


Personally before the fast I drink lots of water and try and eat non-spicy carb rich foods. So pasta, rice, or my favourite, porridge with banana and raisins.

As for breaking the fast, it is traditional to break it with a date.  I also have fresh fruit, water and tea. Usually I am full with very little intake, and feel like a snooze!

Abstaining from food is only part of fasting. So is abstaining from vulgar speech, gossip, anger etc. Often this is harder to guard against. In addition you are not meant to smoke or kiss.

Ultimately, the aim is be more aware (God Conscious), more watchful and more pious. 

Usually I try and contemplate somewhat before I start the fast, just thinking how many people around the world are doing the same, or how many people have no option but to go hungry. 

Also I am reminded just how dependent I am on the world around me. The strongest man can been beaten by a child if he is denied food and water.

I hope you the chance to experience it, and gain something from the experience.","1312157308"

I don't know how old you are, but as a digital native I know that there are so many things that I would have no idea about if it were left to school and parents etc. And there's no way you get someone to just walk into a library and know exactly what they want to read, and there's no way to read enough about even one subject that you'll know every book. 

I just think the internet is an extremely valuable tool even with its fluff. And it far surpasses television even if you've only ever explored one thing of the back of it.

you can see alot on a number of swamp walks as well. you just need some shoes you can beat up, socks and long jeans or pants you dont mind getting muddy. and a broom handle or other walking stick. again, big cypress does a ranger led swamp walk right across from the oasis visitor center which eventually joins up with the florida trail as well. gator hook trail off loop road is a good one as well.

The more I sit properly with my back straight and keeping my center lined up the less it seems to affect me.

Also, try to sit that way as long as you can in class and out of class, take a break, then do it again.  I saw lots of people do that and built up their ability.

Hating is the wrong word, I think they're mentally disturbed - often depressive - individuals. They have nothing in common with gays as a demographic. Gay is a sexuality choice, not a gender choice. Gays don't need to chop their knob off to become what they want to be, they are just asking to not be persecuted, not waste the time and skills of qualified surgeons and valuable hospital beds while there are people dying for lack of health care. Selfish pricks with first world problems, is another way to put it. Also, boob jobs are another moral outrage under this same criteria.

I wouldn't -mind- being told that I'm not on their ""sex list"" or whatever, but they wouldn't say that because they'd worry about appearing shallow and puerile--it makes sense to me.

Imagine if you drew a few dots in marker on a balloon and started to blow it up, you'd notice every point moving away from every other point as the balloon expands.  This is exactly what space is doing, it seems to be expanding.

So a bunch of scientists got to thinking, if everything is expanding away from each other, what if we ran time backwards?  Where is everything expanding FROM?  Is there a point at which the entire universe was collapsed into a single point that exploded and caused everything to expand outward?

An explosion generates a lot of heat and energy when it goes off and we even think we've detected some of the heat from the giant big bang explosion in something called Cosmic Microwave Background, which is really just another way of saying heat.

Also, by looking at how fast everything is moving away, we can easily see how far we need to rewind for everything to be in the same place, 13.7 billion years.  This is how we arrive at the age of the universe.

"harrypotter","t5_2qiqi","This is a great thread--there are so many. I can't choose an absolute favorite, but here are a couple of top ones:

--

""George,"" said Fred, ""I think we've outgrown a full-time education.""

""Yeah, I've been feeling that way myself,"" said George lightly.

""Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?"" asked Fred.

""Definitely,"" said George.

And before Umbridge could say a word, they raised their wants and said together, ""Accio Brooms!""

Harry heard a loud crash somewhere in the distance. Looking to his left he ducked just in time -- Fred and George's broomsticks, one still trailing the heavy chain and iron peg with which Umbridge had fastened them to the wall, were hurtling along the corridor toward their owners. They turned left, streaked down the stairs, and stopped sharply in front of the twins, the chain clattering loudly on the flagged stone floor.

""We won't be seeing you,"" Fred told Professor Umbridge, swinging his leg over his broomstick.

""Yeah, don't bother to keep in touch,"" said George, mounting his own.
Fred looked around at the assembled students and at the silent, watchful crowd.

""If anybody fancies buying a Portable Swamp, as demonstrated upstairs, come to number ninety-three Diagon Alley -- Weasley's Wizard Wheezes,"" he said in a loud voice. ""Our new premises!""

""Special discounts to Hogwarts students who swear they're going to use our products to get rid of this old bat,"" said George, pointing at Professor Umbridge.

""STOP THEM!"" shrieked Umbridge, but it was too late. As the Inquisitorial Squad closed in, Fred and George kicked off from the floor, shooting fifteen feet into the air, the iron peg swinging dangerously below. Fred looked across the hall at the poltergeist bobbing on his level above the crowd.

""Give her hell from us, Peeves.""

And Peeves, whom Harry had never seen take an order from a student before, swept his belled hat from his head and sprang to a salute as Fred and George wheeled about to tumultuous applause from the students below and sped out of the open front doors into the glorious sunset. 


--

""Harry!"" said Fred, elbowing Percy out of the way and bowing deeply. ""Simply splendid to see you, old boy--""

""Marvelous,"" said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing Harry's hand in turn. ""Absolutely spiffing.""

Percy scowled.

""That's enough, now,"" said Mrs. Weasley.

""Mum!"" said Fred as though he'd only just spotted her and seizing her hand too. ""How really corking to see you--""

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The diesel engine had already existed for quite some time when the gasoline engine was first invented. The original motivation for moving to gasoline was that with a spark plug doing the ignition you would use a lower compression ratio and therefore the rotating parts would sustain less stress and could be made lighter.  Lighter parts allow you to reach higher top RPMs, which generally leads to a more pleasant and sporty driving experience in an automobile.  But to make up for this lower compression ratio, these new engines needed special fuel (i.e. gasoline) that was more highly refined (and therefore more expensive) than diesel so that it burned faster.  At this point efficiency/mileage was not a concern in the slightest, it was all about making the driving experience most pleasant.

Since that time, various ways of compensating for the diesel engine's lack of high RPM capability were popularized, such as lighter alloys and turbochargers.  And modern diesel automobiles have mostly shrugged off that reputation of being sluggish to drive, at least in places like Europe where petrol is really expensive.  And its higher compression ratio means it's more efficient, and the fuel is less refined so it's a double win for overall mileage/fuel prices.

You could run a diesel engine on regular gasoline/petrol, I think.  There might be an issue with seals being degraded, but otherwise there's nothing stopping you.  But nobody does that because gasoline costs more on account of being more highly processed, so the whole point of a diesel is to not pay that premium.","1312157361"

"HeroesofNewerth","t5_2r497","~1850 mmr guy here, im gona start watching id: 54534988, your playing FA.

Lets se what i can find :)

Starting items:
Your original idea is good, however if your going mid a bottle as start is not recommended unless you really know what your doing and know how to abuse a flying courier.
A few extra stats for the first minutes for the extra creep kills and then bringing the bottle with the courier is much better.

Another thing is that no one in your team bought any wards and you still have 150gold from selling one of your 150gold +3 agi thing. To get a ward for that money as protection from ganks and spotting the rune is a nice thing.
Insted you got a pret crown that indeed give you stats but i would personaly prefer wards over +2 stats.

Remember, even if your the carry. Wards are always superior and if your team sucks, get them. They will save you heaps of gold in the long run.

Going by replay counter, not ingame counter.

07:50 Your laning with succu vs a solo CD. You should be able to harass him out of the lane pretty easy if you worked together. I can se that your trying to harass and thats good, practice makes perfect. Lasthitting is a bit off but thats all practice aswell. Remember that a creepkill for you is WAY more important than a deny. Your prio as carry in this case should be:
1. Creepkills
2. Harass/deny

When competing for creepkills in a lane vs an opponen you either want to hurt him bad so that he focus on other things than lasthitting (getting some reg on courier or shit like that) or our last him and break him down.
Now your in a clear advantage due to the fact that your 2 and hes solo, there is a guy in the forest but he is not likely going to gank early, so id stand closer to the creeps so that my projectile run is as low as possible. You can afford to take the risk of standing closed to the creeps, CD cant.

10:30 I do not agree with buying a power supply instead of boots in that situation. CD is hardly spamming any spells and you will have little to no use for it the next 5-9min. Boots however will allow you to harass more effectively.

12:00 Yep here would boots have been good, bit of luck on those entangle procs tho.

14:45 Dunno whats going on here but for about seconds your ignoring the creepwave and standing outside xp range.

17:07 When pushing towers, always use the skelletons, they are fucking crazy at killing stuff early lvls.

26:00 Slither ulti didnt hit you, when you went back you gave up a free kill on ws.

End teamfight you made a good ulti, shame that jere used his ulti at the same time.

Dont know if this gave you anything and im sure ive missed a ton of stuff. Just wrote what went through my mind, hope it helps a bit.","1312157383"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","You make a few claims here that seem dubious and because this is a front page story, it gives cause for concern. Can you answer my questions?

First, you say graduated without paying tuition. According to the FIU site, your classes would have been canceled if you didn't pay the tuition by a certain date. If your classes were canceled, you certainly would not have been tested or able to graduate. How can you explain this? 

You also claim that your family would be upset if you had gone to a state school. Do they know that FIU is a state school and the loan program you participated in was only for state schools in Florida?

To take the FFVII example, it's true that there isn't any spoken dialog. But take a step back. What's happening while dialog appears on screen? Characters gesture wildly, background music plays 
Edit ( fell asleep whilst typing this on my phone （╯'□'）╯︵ ┻━┻  ) 

things happen in the background. All these things add to what's being said explicitly and provide for different interpretations based on the individual. Granted, the same thing can be achieved by words and words alone, especially in a book, but it is precisely because a book has none of the above elements that imagination plays such a big role. When the visual and audio components are fleshed out for us, we don't use our imagination as much. 

Worse is when the entire game is so well presented in the audio and visual components, and that suddenly grinds to a halt in front of a wall of text. Reading a description of an NPC's account of the history of a dungeon is much less exciting than seeing it transpire with a narrated description before our eyes. Eg, [guild wars 2 dungeon instance intro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rgNxFkQW4A)  . Now imagine that in a wall of text instead.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","&gt;One fifth of one fifth means 1 out of 25 accidents is caused by cell phone use while driving. Why not use a hands-free unit?

[Because it doesn't make a difference](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_phones_and_driving_safety#Handsfree_device).  The reason why talking on a cell phone causes accidents is because you're distracted by the call, and the mere fact that you have a hand up to your head or not doesn't change the risk.

&gt;Driving while using a handsfree cellular device is not safer than using a hand held cell phone, as concluded by case-crossover studies.[19][20] epidemiological,[1][2] simulation,[9] and meta-analysis[11][12]. The increased ""cognitive workload"" involved in holding a conversation, not the use of hands, causes the increased risk.[21][22][23] For example, a Carnegie Mellon University study found that merely listening to somebody speak on a phone caused a 37% drop in activity in the parietal lobe, where spatial tasks are managed.[24]

IIRC changing settings on the audio system or even having a conversation with someone else in the car is just as distracting and carries the same risk of accident, which makes sense from the above information.","1312157408"

"Homebrewing","t5_2qj8u","I don't really have plans, but I can explain it.

I started with [this](http://www.harborfreight.com/1-inch-clear-water-pump-1479.html) pump.  I cut an extension cord in half and hooked the wires from the male end up to the pump to power it.

Attached to the pump are two 1"" to 1/2"" PVC bushings.  Screwed into the bushings are two 1/2"" PVC unions, (allow for quick disconnect of the pipes from the pump).  Attached to the inlet of the pump is a short ""up"" section of 1/2"" PVC, a 90\* PVC corner, small chunk of PVC, another corner, and a ""down"" section of PVC that goes to the bottom of the bucket for intake of cleansing solution.

The outlet side of the pump  goes up, over, and down into the bucket in the same way, then turns around with two more corners and goes straight up.  I have a piece of metal grate that sits on top of the bucket, (I think it's left over from some college-age cheapo shelving stuff).  On top of that, the pipe goes up and through [one of these](http://www.northernbrewer.com/brewing/brewing-equipment/fermenting-equipment/carboy-accessories/carboy-dryer.html), which holds the carboy upside down and allows it to drain out past the PVC sticking up into it.

So that's what you see there....what I've since added to it is a + cross about halfway up the ""outlet"" pipe that splits off cleanser and goes into quick disconnects for kegs, so I can run hot oxyclean through the diptubes of the keg, as well as the center of them, at the same time.  I also have a water heater element installed in the bucket now, to heat the water up as I clean, (not used for carboys).

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Years ago, I saw a documentary about a few people with BIID though no one called them that.

One guy was _really_ determined to lose one of his legs. He even practiced by tying his ankle to his tigh. No idea about other countries, but in Germany, it is highly illegal for a doctor to remove a working limb and so he could not find anyone willing to do it, no matter how much money he offered. He ended up putting his leg on a railtrack and almost bled to death before they got him to ER. The guy is happy as a clam that he lost a leg and loves to take extended walks on crutches.

They also interviewed someone who lost a leg by accident. He almost cried because he could not understand how someone would do this to themselves.

Maybe tying his leg up would do something for OP? Maybe it would just strengthen the urges, though. If I were OP, I would go see a shrink or ten.","1312157415"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The big bang starts with the concept of a singularity. Basically you can think of this as everything that exists today in the universe squashed into an impossibly small amount of space (single point). For whatever reason, this point ""explodes"" and these things start to fly apart very quickly.

At this point everything exists in a ""soup"" of the basic ingredients of the universe. As the soup expands, it cools and allows these ingredients to interact. These ingredients then form the elementary particles that we learn about in chemistry class (electrons, protons, neutrons, etc). Light ""particles"" called photons are also included in this soup. 

As the soup expands, protons and neutrons interact and start to form the ""nuclei"" (centers) of helium atoms (two protons and two neutrons bound together).

Eventually the soup expands enough to let the light particles within the soup travel long distances before hitting these nuclei (this is called the microwave background if you've heard of it, and is the oldest thing we can ""see"" with telescopes because before then light wasn't ""free"" to run around). At this time electrons start to interact with the nuclei to form the full elements of hydrogen and helium.

As the soup expands further, hydrogen and helium begin to group together. Eventually there is enough gas in one place and it all collapses into a star, fusion (process where atoms interact to produce light) happens and the star begins to shine!

I left out some (as far as I know) still controversial descriptions of why stars formed (fluctuations in dark energy/matter) and whether stars or galaxies formed first (top down vs bottom up formation). I can give some LI5 explanations of those too if wanted. I also left out some more complicated things like leptons and hadrons and quarks and stuff that came before that because 5 year olds don't need to know that :)","1312157432"

Bank your metals into an upgrade only when you feel you can leave your sentry to get more without it being killed.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","Rape is very common in the LGBT+ community. Transgender people are often raped, yes. It's really very sad. 

Growing up, I DEFINITELY felt like some sort of freak. I never had the words to describe being transgender, but when I finally did, I also learned about the LGBT+ community, so I tended to feel less alone and less freaky. Now, I don't feel like a freak publicly, but I tend to privately hate myself and my body, for being so WRONG. 

My rape and transgender status aren't connected in any way, I don't think. I was definitely not raped for being trans. I would say I'm not trans because of being raped, as I've almost always had these feelings.

I don't have preferences for what gender I socialize with, but I refuse to socialize with anyone who asks me what my genitals look like. If someone asks me if I have a penis or vagina, I refuse to be around them. I mean, c'mon. You wouldn't ask a non-trans person what genitals they had, would you? It's just rude and a little creepy.

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","&gt; It may be surprising just how strict the DP laws are here.

Not to me, I have some experience here.  I was answering a claim that said that records related to the transaction must be deleted once the transaction is completed.  This was wrong, and I showed it.  That is all.

&gt; It is more correct to say it has never been tested in court- which means people will continue to do it until someone takes a case and it is ruled on.

Cool.  So will you take the case?  If you take this issue so seriously, will you be the one to take a civil case against your parents for their breach of your constitutional rights (as you see it) by baptising you as an infant and giving their consent on your behalf?  If you won't take the case, who do you expect to do it?

&gt; The previous complaint made to the Commissioner was poorly done (the complainant wasn't even sure they were baptised and didn't respond to the commissioner comments). The judgement does not deal with the issues raised by the original poster above, which would usually require deletion of the information.

The previous complainant was a bit of an asshat who appeared not to have his facts right.  But the comment I quoted from the DPC specifically said that even if the complainaint had been able to produce the record (baptismal cert), then a deletion would not be required, merely a note on it to the effect that the complainant no longer was part of the church.  This exactly deals with the OP's query ""I'm wondering if under data protection law I can oblige the Catholic church to remove me from its database. I have never consented to them having my information (it was done on my behalf while I was younger).""  The answer is no.

However, this is just one person's opinion, albeit that person being the Data Protection Commissioner, who one might expect to have a certain expertise in the area.

That's why I suggest taking it to court to challenge the DPC's interpreation of the law.  Writing to a TD is a bit pontless in this regard.  When you say it's ""somewhere between"" referring the case to the DPC and challening that opinion in the courts, I take it that means that no-one has actually challenged it yet?  IF so, I would, again suggest, getting all those who take this seriously enough to actually do something about it to chip in, find an excellent and sympathetic brief and give it your best shot in court.  Win the case once, and the precedent is there for all.

"canada","t5_2qh68","I think a lot of people either misread the context of my post, or are angry that I called them out on some things. 

1. Corporations never paid the majority of taxes in the 40's. 

2. People love to say that corporations should be taxed more without any real reasons. Case in point, the guy I responded to that thought they should be taxed more like in the 40's. And even if they contributed over 50% of the taxes, what today would compare well with the climate during the apex of WW2 and the years following? 

3. I didn't say corporations shouldn't be taxed more, I asked for reasons why. Then I got downvoted. 

4. Reaganomics wasn't even focused on cutting corporate taxes. It was focused on cutting taxes for the richest people, and did so drastically. It was focused on deregulation. It did this too. The corporate tax rate wasn't a major tenant. 

Instead of taxing the shit out of companies, why don't people push to tax the shit out of the highest income classes? Most of the highest paid people are in public companies. It's not their company. Many are career CEO's bouncing around and fucking things up. But many ordinary Canadians have their retirement invested in companies like this. They are the shareholders. Many ordinary Canadians work in these companies. They are the face and the body of the company. 

If companies were taxed at levels equal or more than the US, why would they choose to be in Canada? What would happen to all the workers if they left? The CEO's would be fine. 

I'm wondering if any of you have done a comparison of the benefits of a 10% increase on corporate taxes vs. a 10% increase on the highest income brackets. Or a decrease in many consumption or excise taxes. Or a decrease in the wasteful gov't spending (No, this does not mean private healthcare)

I swear, you can't win sometimes in r/Canada sometimes. Call someone out that's spouting ignorant shit and you get downvoted, especially if it's fiscally conservative.

It will be tempting to try to do lvl 60/70/80 raids when you hit those levels, I would advise against this, because they give very minimal xp and garbage gear. 

Dungeons are by far the fastest way to level, so if you are looking to get to 85 quick then be in the que all the time. 

Don't be afraid to replace your gear when you enter outlands/northrend/cataclysm, the greens will be exponentially better that anything from the previous content.

While most people will suggest mining/skinning/herbalism, I find that enchanting is very helpful for a new player, as it makes very good gold and takes hardly any time to do, when you replace old gear you disenchant it rather than sell it to a vendor, this will highly increase your profits, especially when you enter northrend/cataclysm zones.","1312157495"

But the rule of thumb for a person with perfect normal-range vision under standard lighting is one minute of arc per light-dark cycle. So if there were a white picket fence silhouetted against a black wall, a person with normal-perfect vision would be able to distinguish individual pickets if they subtended about thirty seconds of arc.

But of course, there are far too many variables involved for that to be anything other than a generalization.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","You have to understand that the infestor is a very high gas costing unit, also it takes much long to get out that a decent number of mutas and on top of that has low counter attack potential. and tanks are really good against it. I understand that Destiny does use Infested terrans to take out siege lines but with such great spread and marine control that top tier terran players have, it is really difficult to make your infestor cost efficient for what it does till you have the econ to suport it. Also the Ling/infestor has a really a hard time stoping early game tank pushes that come out of terran since infestors are slow at coming out and you can loose the game to a good contain from an early tank marine push. Also in one of DRG's games I did think he should have tec switched into infestors to hold of all the marine clumps. Muta/ling/bane gives the zerg more mobility and has more counter attack potential and can hold off reinforcements and with good muta micro you can simply just win the game right there and then. it also allows you to drone up new bases while keeping the tarran at his base. I'm not trying to say that infestors are not good against terran, they really are, I do think that the infestor is a really strong unit right now and a little imba in ZvP ( I am a Z player btw), but infestors are way better in the later game against terran along with broodlords which is where the infestor really stand out in the ZvT match up which is where the imbalance part of the infestor kicks in. Destiny's style in ZvT is really good, but if you watch him he really does get a late 3rd because he cannot gain map control really easily and he also tecs up to hive REALLY fast and he tries to drag the game out to the late game, (like he did against bomber and he showed us how strong his style really is), if any of you watched his stream the few days before MLG he was really looking for decent terran opponents to practice against because he felt like it was his worse match up. So saying that these top end players going Muta/ling/bane is bad against terran, it really isn't, it's actually really strong and it allows you to get to a much later game which is where you want to get to and get to a infestor broodlord composition or just make a really large muta count and  deny the terran more then 2 bases, also if you look at the 1rst game between DRG and MMA, MMA was a little all in with the push and if DRG had held he woulda won that game, so that has to be put into perspective. 

TL;DR Muta ling bane gains you map control and allows you to get to a late game and does lots of harass, while infestors take to much time to make and has a hard time stopping early tank marine contains.","1312157496"

To me the most likely scenario though is that the caption-writer saw a black woman, assumed that because she was black she was ignorant and as a result would write that way.

I am now 28 years old &amp; here is the best advice I can give you: Accept who she is. You don't have to like it &amp; you'll probably *never* understand it, but accept it &amp; move on. Live your life to make *you* happy. Don't worry about what your mother thinks. Your mother sounds like a very selfish person (Mine is this way as well). Your mother will probably never change her ways &amp; the sooner you stop trying to make her happy/understand her, the happier &amp; more full your own life will be. If she makes you feel bad, don't call/go home as often. When you do go home, stay with a friend instead of your parents &amp; cut your visits to a few hours at a time. More likely, the less she knows about what's going on with you, the less likely she is to bitch &amp; rain on your parade. &amp; For the love of God, it sounds like your brother is a very sick individual who needs some help. I know you feel bad for him, but he did some very horrible things to you &amp; sounds like he still is. Maybe it's best to keep your distance. Don't go anywhere by yourself with him.

If you add a a callback function to the request jquery automatically assumes that it is dealing with a jsonp request. Caching is disabled for jsonp requests by default. Therefore a timestamp will be added to every request in order to bust the cache. 

You need to activate it explicitly by setting the cache to true.

For more information read the cache part at
http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/

If this does not work, use the $.ajax method instead. The correct syntax for using it without cache busting can be found here: http://www.yqlblog.net/blog/2010/03/12/avoiding-rate-limits-and-getting-banned-in-yql-and-pipes-caching-is-your-friend/

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Well, it depends on how you view feminism. Here's a quote for ya: 

“ The false notion that feminism has ever been a unified front has actually been a weapon of anti-feminists, who like to portray themselves as bravely storming its walls. In fact, feminism has been a banner hoisted rather loosely by those who share an extremely broad and righteous goal, but who also are engaged in bubbling, raucous, often fractious discourse. In fact, in my opinion, disagreement, differing perspectives, competing priorities — these are not just the inconvenient side-effects of feminism, they actually often give it its form, its momentum, the energy to keep moving forward and changing and growing. We should be glad of them, even as they leave us exasperated and frustrated and sometimes at odds with those we respect most.""
— Rebecca Traister in dialogue with some of the writers of Feministing, including me, on her recent New York Times Magazine piece on SlutWalks.

So, feminism tends to focus on women because they have been an oppressed group throughout history, but gender egalitarianism, which you brought up, is equally important. I consider myself BOTH a feminist and a gender egalitarian, and I think that feminism is definitely still relevant and not at all broken, since male privilege still permeates our society, etc. ","1312157519"

"programming","t5_2fwo","&gt; This sounds awesome, and the kind of thing I'd like to do. I have some of this knowledge, I wonder how I get to the stage where I'm employable?

I'm an AMM/HFT developer for a top-tier investment bank in Manhattan, and seeing as my team has hired several people this year, I can offer some insight into the kinds of candidates we look for.

  1. Prior finance experience is absolutely not required, and in fact we prefer to bring in people from ""the outside"".  As in any other sector, finance is flooded with many mediocre programmers and a few very good ones.  Perhaps more so than in other sectors, the very good programmers are hard to find--I suspect it's because the good ones are very well taken care of and stay put for years at a time, or they hate finance and go elsewhere.  Our greatest success has been with candidates coming out of Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the gaming industry.  Several of our strongest candidates have told us that our interview process is unlike anything they have ever experienced before, which lends credence to my theory that many HFT groups have less aggressive requirements than we do.  I therefore suspect there are many opportunities for bright programmers who want to get into HFT but are not quite ready to join Wall Street's top echelon.

  2. We value intelligence and problem solving abilities far more than experience with any particular language, platform, etc.  We often hire C++ programmers for exclusively Java-based roles because, on average, their knowledge is ""closer to the metal"".  I think one of the reasons we've had such good luck with game programmers is because they are used to working closer to the hardware level and, consequently, have a more thorough understanding of things like cache coherency and low-level synchronization mechanisms.  If someone is bright, has a solid grasp of C.S. concepts (algorithms, data structures, etc.), and thoroughly understands memory models and concurrent programming, then he or she would be a great candidate.  Framework knowledge is nigh worthless, as we seldom touch the standard Java APIs and have never touched J2EE.  Languages aren't all that important either, as a bright programmer can learn a new language easily enough.  That said, candidates who know the Java language very well will have a decided advantage, especially if they understand the in's and out's of the HotSpot VM (the JIT compiler, the GC, etc.).

  3. We place heavy emphasis on concurrent (multi-threaded) programming.  We expect candidates to have a solid grasp of atomic operations, memory barriers, the behavior and costs of Java's 'volatile' keyword, the nature and costs of context switches, etc.  Candidates will almost certainly be asked to implement at least one lock-free data structure or algorithm.

  4. Deep hardware knowledge is a plus, but by no means required.  Architecture-specific knowledge beyond understanding the x86 memory model is not expected.  We expect our candidates to have a decent understanding of things like caches and instruction reordering.  We do not expect candidates to know the in's and out's of the PCI-E bus, not do we expect them to have experience with VHDL, GPU programming, or anything of that nature.

As to the work involved, I find it extremely gratifying.  Every day brings new challenges, and there is never a dull moment.  Some of our programmers are deeply interested in the business side, but others (like myself) are in it for the challenge and the love of writing high-performance code.  It also doesn't hurt that we can hold AVP, VP, or even Director titles (and the salaries that go with them) just for writing code.  If you want to earn great income to solve challenging programming problems while not being relegated to management, finance is a great field to be in.

As to compensation, let me first say that most of our developers make nowhere near 500k annually.  The median *base salary* among my colleagues is probably in the mid-100k range for those with an AVP title and in the upper-100k range for those with a VP title.  Bonuses are discretionary and tend to be around 50% (assuming good personal performance), and from what I've heard from head hunters at other investment banks, these numbers are pretty common.  There's plenty of room to grow, though, and if you can help the group make money, then the sky's the limit.  I think most of us average 10 hours a day, 5 days a week, with almost all of that time spent writing code.  There have been a few weeks where I averaged closer to 12 hours a day, but it doesn't happen often.  Sometimes the average drops to 9 hours a day, but that's usually the minimum.  For what it's worth, I worked similar hours before I got into finance.

I have heard of some HFT groups paying salaries in excess of $300k for truly extraordinary programmers, but so far as I can tell, these are few and far between, and the programmers in question must bring some very compelling skills to the table that the group currently lacks.  Programmers might make more at hedge funds or the super-elite teams at banks like Goldman Sachs, but the hours are probably murder, and I suspect there's more of a ""cutthroat"" environment (which, by the way, is completely absent from our group).

So, if you think the work sounds compelling, hopefully I've given you an idea of what we look for.  Again, our requirements are probably more stringent than is typical for HFT teams, so this is by no means a universal guide.  If you feel you have some of the skills HFT groups are looking for, then I encourage you to apply.  You have nothing to lose, and it's a great way to see how you measure up and where you need to improve.  I did one round of interviews, had a couple decent offers (which I declined), took six months to brush up in some areas, and ultimately ended up in a better position during my next round of interviews.","1312157551"

"HeroesofNewerth","t5_2r497","and that is an issue for HoN, one which stems from conversion instead of redesign

personally i am not sure if it is possible to make it fair to both sides, the original or the f2p players

because if they keep down this track of no legacy account, i foresee ebay or d2jsp or whichever place to become a place where you sell your legacy accounts...

look at DDO, what they did was that the f2p masses did not have access to the newer stuff, think of it like progression (like wow) raiding or what nots, and the paid people from before had what was available to that point and then they too had to buy new content packs like the masses and made it so that it is actually cheaper / on par with the old model of monthly sub (if you just buy the content pack, and not the aesthetic stuff) and that they get convenience things like more character slots and what nots 

in short, in a moba game unless they added something like mastery pages and rune pages like LoL, where convenience of switching between sets can be sold, it is really hard to monetize the existing user base without pissing someone off, and they did not have those things in the beginning and if they add it in 2.2 say, there will be riots (pun intended).


from what i see so far, it seems that they are shafting the old players in the long term (the mention of expansions that we may have to pay is... well let's just say that my confidence those things don't include maps or modes is low) while giving us a short term advantage assuming that the f2p masses become so invested in the game that they would have 50-80% of the hero pool some time down the road (~a year?)

JJ Thompson's example goes something like: a famous violinist has a terminal disease and can only be saved by some kind of imagined medical transplant procedure from a particular woman. Violin fans kidnap the woman and hook her up to the violinist.

If the woman remains hooked up to the violinist for 9 months he will be cured. If she is unhooked he will die in a matter of days. The kidnappers do not restrict the woman's freedom to decide once the hook up has occurred.

If I gut hook a fish, I carefully remove it before release.

That said, I also eat some of the fish I catch. It's a practice known as sustainable harvest.

In fact, oftentimes if the Terran player has the choice between sacrificing the hellions to kill a few drones and saving the hellions to retain map control they'll decide to not sacrifice the hellions because getting anything less than a mineral line (or most of it) isn't all that meaningful compared to the investment you made into the hellions.

Also, it's not like the roaches just stop working when the hellion harassment phase ends--they're units which will be integral to your defence for the entire early game, including any followup pushes. Given how prone Zergs like IdrA are to just not make any units and pray they don't get attacked you'd think this might help them a bit.

Sure, you can't tech at the fastest possible rate while making gas units, but teching at the fastest possible rate is a really good way to lose and oftentimes staying on low tech can be extremely good anyways (some Korean zergs have been staying on hatch tech for longer and longer recently, notably Losira if I recall correctly).","1312157593"

I was on the green line back to Clackamas, and I always sit up front with my iPod and a book and keep to myself. One day, out of nowhere the driver stops the train, comes out of the front, and berates me on the volume of my iPod and how I'm about to be kicked off. He'd thought the toddler talking next to me was my music (I can't hear it three inches from my ear, but whatev). Right after this, two guys come on and LOUDLY discuss their drug use and sex lives next to me, this woman and her 3-year-old, and not a word is said.

The other fun time happened last week: this guy and his friends came on (at Gateway, of course) baked out of their fucking minds, and his friends (two females) were trying to convince this 22-year-old guy to stop fucking his three slutty 17-year-old girlfriends by detailing the girls' sex lives.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Thanks, but I can't take full credit for it. That is my interpretation and use of what Hitchens says. I think it is very valid and the distinctions are important. 

For example, if I have a 7 year old child that intentionally dumps an ice cream cone on someone to be mean, I can (and should) apologize for it as the parent. But I am not apologizing for the action the child did - I am apologizing for the inconvenience imposed on the person and, by extension, my parenting since I should have taught the child better. That is why we often make the child apologize as well, because even if they don't understand exactly why at the time (or believe it), aping the motions instills in them the notion that only you can apologize for your misdeeds and eventually (hopefully) the child will learn and adopt this ethos.

But if I am some total stranger, in no way related to the child, then I can say I feel sorry for the inconvenience the stranger experienced to be nice, but I cannot further mitigate the transgression in any way. If the parent and child walk away and say ""fuck off"" then no action I can possibly do can atone for that transgression. I can just be a humanist and help the ""victim"" clean up and commiserate with them. 

In the same way, this OP is acting in a humanistic way, and offering to commiserate with us over the negative actions we experience at the hands of Christians and theists. But (s)he must recognize that (s)he cannot actually apologize *for* those other Christians or in any way mitigate anything being done to us. (S)he can only extend humanistic sympathy at the transgression we face and nothing more. 

As a community, most of us have decided that while such humanistic sentiment is nice and appreciated, it does nothing to address the actual problem that breeds the issues we face - hence the ""Thanks but don't tell us... tell your circle or church."" We'd rather see *action* and change rather than just platitudes and extended sympathies. I reckon that stems from our general ethos and liken it to prayer being a waste of time when you can actually *do* something instead.

It's not about religion. In fact, it's very careful to provide a list of ways 'spirtual' can be interpreted, and says something about 'religion' being 'only one of many ways' an airman can increase his spiritual resilience.

Like Gegadin said, it's a way of gauging what sort of support structure an airman, or a soldier has behind him.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","Its because MFA seems to not value style. And doesn't appreciate it. I am not a punk, but I love it when someone does punk well or incorporates it into their look. Or Goth or skate or whatever. I don't consider myself hip hop but I appreciate how Jay Z dresses (mostly because his clothes fit--I am looking at you Lil Wayne). 

The argument made most often here is that this is a forum for guys who have only begun their journey to dress better. But shit style is just as important as fashion. Dressing fashionably (IMHO) shows that you know what's up and signifies that you are abreast of trends, but you need to have a sense of personal style, otherwise you are just wearing whatever hot now, like a sheep.

The MFA ""look"" to me is pretty conservative. I would consider it preppy or monied. I can appreciate that--personally I like prep when it's pushed to the douche limits (see Chuck Bass from Gossip Girl). Though J. Crew is ok too. 

I see style in dressing just like I see style in other art. Abstract Expressionism might not be my cup of tea, but as long as I understand the theory and can evaluate the execution, then I can appreciate the work, and I can understand the mastery in a Jackson Pollack. Same in clothes. 

I still like MFA.  At least people here are making deliberate, considered choices. There are too many dudes who just wear whatever is clean or at hand or close to their size. With no thought at all. I try not to judge them and assume that the thoughtlessness is not limited to their clothing choices, but I find that difficult. ","1312157678"

There are a number of comments in which you say you want his license revoked so he can no longer practice medicine.

The English league is definitely amongst the top leagues in the world (quite possibly the best, although different people with different criteria may feel otherwise). It's a good place to start, but give Spain, Italy and Germany a chance too - they're the other top leagues. There's plenty of good football in France, Holland and Brazil as well. Also, give the MLS a shot - there's nothing like going to matches. 

Bouncing around youtube will get you some good highlights, and there's plenty of clips here too. 101greatgoals.com is one of several good sites to get current highlights from. Footytube is another. MyP2P.eu is a decent place to find streams if you want to catch a game. Find a good sports bar near you where football fans congregate for matches, that's the best place to get into it.

Also, the Community Shield between Manchester United and Manchester City is next week (I believe) and that's a good game to start out with. It's *technically* a friendly game, but it's going to be competitive as hell - they're local rivals, title rivals (ask your Leeds-supporting friend for a quick debrief on this one) and both have very strong teams.

I'm not saying that people here are not voluntarily participating. I'm sure they would click away if they wanted.

I realize this is low risk stuff, but what is the point of teaching you about how research is conducted and skipping out on important elements of how it is done?

It's going to take time to have e-sports as polished and professional as mainstream sports. Remember MLG dallas back in april? Less than four months ago. What a fucking trainwreck that event was. Compare that to Anaheim and Columbus. MLG has improved so, so much in such a short time. Considering how much MLG has improved in such a short period of time I think the overlay colour being wrong is kind of a tiny issue.

MLG has worked very hard to improve and they're bringing the content for free.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","OK, can I just first send you a hug? It sounds like you need a lot of them and haven't gotten them from the person who is supposed to give them to you!

OK, now that that's done. I have a toxic mother. And for the longest time I just tried to have minimal contact. But then I went and had a daughter, and I don't want to have the same relationship with her that I have with my mother. So I have tried to build a bridge more to figure out what my part could have been in the disaster that was our relationship. I have figured out with a lot of help from other family members, my husband, etc., that it really IS her, not me. But that's made me feel stronger about myself, better about myself. And that's enabled me to ""be the bigger person"" with all of her shit.

In other words? I ignore what she says. Not physically, of course. I'm civil. But I refuse to internalize it. It has helped me a lot with ME. When I allow her telling me how I should really have a better job, be skinnier, etc., to come into my head and into my decision-making, I lose myself in it. Refusing to take what she says into account has allowed me to take control of my own life and given me the self esteem I didn't have growing up. 

I feel good knowing that I can be the adult even if my mother can't. It doesn't work for everyone, but that's my two cents. Again, good luck and hugs!","1312157712"

"needadvice","t5_2r367","You're clearly depressed. It's situational, so you don't need to take antidepressants or anything, but you might profit from talking to a counselor. I'd suggest that if your school provides mental health counseling for its students. 

Here's what I'd want to know. Are your parents paying for your education? If you move out, will they continue to pay (some conditions would be okay - keeping your grades up, attending class, etc.).

It does seem to me that moving out would help, but my concern would be that your depression would continue and that you'd fall into a clinical depression and dig yourself a hole you'd have serious trouble climbing out of. Can you move out to a place in your current locale, continue college and working? And not sit in your apartment and smoke dope and drink? Moving out would benefit you if you got a job, made a living, became self-supporting, and made the acquaintance of your work crew and fellow students. Becoming a competent, self-supporting adult is very liberating, but my concern remains that you'd just drop into a worse funk. Please do yourself a favor and see a counselor; see if you can find out what the situation is that's causing your depression and remedy that situation. You'll be much happier when you address that or those issues.

Good luck.","1312157724"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","&gt;Natural isn't subjective unless you're talking about the philosophy of naturalism. Something is natural if it exists outside of any specific cultural pressure in various unconnected groups. Inherent actions are considered natural.

So is it natural to be straight? Are homosexuals unnatural? Nope, I'm sorry, whether or not you're acting natural and what that natural behavior is is highly subjective.
Humans have evolved to be quite different from each other in how they act. If anything, your upbringing and cultural surroundings may cause you to become insecure about your sexuality, and insecurity often leads to overcompensating aggression.
That kind of behavior may be ""normal"" for some, but it's certainly not natural for all humans.

&gt;You haven't presented any reason to curtail these freedoms. All you've said is (to paraphrase) ""It makes me uncomfortable"".

As I repeatedly mentioned, I never asked for them to be illegal. When I'm outside, trying to get things done, I don't want to be confronted with aggressive sexual behavior from people who are actively trying to get my attention. Nope, leave me alone, I don't want to be distracted by that, it's hard enough to concentrate on whatever it is I'm doing at the moment. There aren't many things in this world that are bound to keep your mind as busy as sex, so I'd rather you didn't try to bother me with that. Dick.
&gt;You ignored that I set you wouldn't be violating these babies rights (so they are less babies and more dolls) and this wouldn't be unhygienic (so no blood and guts everywhere), so why shouldn't someone be allow to ""kill"" a bunch of dolls if doing so was a natural urge everyone felt.

You never mentioned anything about not violating their rights in your previous post, but I don't really see what point you're trying to make either way. If they're not human beings but dolls and they don't make a mess when slaughtered, then how are they different from dolls?
&gt;So they say, but they're lying. You're making yourself look good so you'll feel good when you think of others looking at you. Ultimately there has to be an other.

That's, like, totally your opinion, man.

&gt;You said there is somehow a difference for publicly displaying your affection for yourselves and for others and that doing it for others is bad. So by that metric all of women's fashion is bad.

How are you getting to the ""some kinds of pda are 'bad' -&gt; therefore all forms of fashion are bad"" conclusion? Fashion and pda are not the same thing. Clothing yourself nicely does not have to be aggressive. Even so, I already mentioned that I believe the way you dress *can* make you look like an idiot in public.

&gt;Ahh moral relativism, that last refuge of a scoundrel. You can't saying why something is wrong other then a vague feeling so you try to chalk it up to moral relativism and that it's ok because anything is ok.

No doubt, ""it's natural and therefore right"" is a perfectly fine argument, on the other hand.
There are no ""normal"" or godgiven laws for human coexistance that are hardprogrammed into each and every single one of us. There are, on the other hand, some very good and not so vague logical reasons as to why certain behavior should be prohibited or frowned upon, and while not everyone might agree on those, making them laws is pretty reasonable, even if a minority disagrees with them. 
&gt;Yes, but you tried saying it wasn't a natural act, it is.

What's natural for primates doesn't have to be natural for humans, either. For all our similarities, there are enough differences in ape and human society.

I doubt many people think that, HOWEVER: When a god is claimed to be ""all loving, all good, and all powerful,"" his existence IS refuted by the existence of evils large and small, from being forced to wear uncomfortable clothes, to the real-life examples of genocide that are supported in biblical texts.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I had a toxic relationship with my mother, I was glad to have just ""survived"" my teen years, and spent most of my adult life seeing her, at most, once a year (though after I got older, maybe past 25, the relationship wasn't really toxic though I was still quite resentful).

I held on to my resentment and, in retrospect, this burdened me emotionally for years. Yes, I was in therapy for years too, but it didn't seem to make much of a difference in this regard.

When she was diagnosed with cancer, I had a decision to make.  Cut her out of my life completely, or forgive her.  I chose the latter and the next five year, before she died, were really wonderful.  There was a good person inside her.  We couldn't talk about the past as she didn't really recall things as I did (or chose not to, I don't know) but I was able to only really feel like an adult after this all happened, and I was in my 30s.

My advice to you is this:

1. Survive.

2. Get the fuck out as soon as you can.

3. Don't live in the past.  Get therapy, and/or cut your mom out of your life entirely, and/or forgive her... whatever you can do, whatever you need to not live with the burden of resentment.

4. If there is an opportunity later in life to do something for her, to be there for her, ***and*** you can deal with it, ***and*** she has come to be a better person, don't let that opportunity slip by.

Right now you just have to survive without doing anything crazy.  I, too, tried to run away, had suicide plans, destroyed things, abused myself, etc.  Ultimately what helped me was getting as far away as I could.

Yes, but historically, these collapses and diminishings of specific 'first world' civilizations *have* happened, and they've happened consistently, every time.

Egypt: Rise and Fall.

Rome? Athens? Sparta? Alexander the Great? Attila the Hun?

At one time, all of these civilizations/human organizations were the largest and most powerful in their sphere, and *all* of them, without fail, collapsed and dispersed. 

Pride cometh before the fall. The organizations forget what it was that made them successful in the first place, begin to relish in their excess, lose discipline and thus control, then comes the inevitable collapse.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","That's a really interesting question. If the Fed didn't use that money, there would be no inflation. Because if you think about it, the money isn't money unless you use it or it has value to someone; it'd just be paper. It is possible that when it was used in 2010, inflation would happen, but the funny thing is that from 2005-2010, there's been inflation already, so the money from 2005 wouldn't be worth as much anyway.

That other scenario you thought of is interesting as well. That would have *devastating* results. The funny thing is about rich people is that, even though Redditors rag on them a lot, they single-handedly fund most investment in this country. For instance, Bill Gates is sitting on billions, but he invested billions into Microsoft too. So if you were to take all of their money out of the picture, all of a sudden you have only low-income and middle-income people spending, and they only spend on day-to-day activities, rather than investing in stocks or anything like that. Actually, I'm pretty sure financial markets would collapse if something like that happened. Kind of interesting to think about though, haha!","1312157795"

Everything is a trade-off and they need to know, what trade-off they are making.

Then again, they should also be able to expect that the back-end programmers actually listen to them, and their ideas about user interaction design.

It's extremely relevant, you don't elect a guy based on a platform that you _hope he'll change in the future_. Nor do you knock a guy for doing _what he says he'll do before you even elected him_.

&gt;It's barely better than doing nothing would have been. In fact, you can argue it's worse, because now it's 'dealt with.' I hope Republicans are successful in repealing the whole damn thing, because that's the only way I see a chance to get real reform on the healthcare front.

You can argue lots of things, but in the eyes of any progressive it's _something_ that _no one_ in the past 80 years has been able to gain any leverage on, the fact that Vermont is getting single payer healthcare makes it a huge deal. The fact that the _rest_ of the progressive world sees this as a huge step forward for America is a big deal. Sure I would have liked to take a jackhammer to our current healthcare system and give it a through reconstruction but I live in _America_, changes here come much later than they usually do in other countries.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","You have to understand that the infestor is a very high gas costing unit, also it takes much long to get out that a decent number of mutas and on top of that has low counter attack potential. and tanks are really good against it. I understand that Destiny does use Infested terrans to take out siege lines but with such great spread and marine control that top tier terran players have, it is really difficult to make your infestor cost efficient for what it does till you have the econ to suport it. Also the Ling/infestor has a really a hard time stoping early game tank pushes that come out of terran since infestors are slow at coming out and you can loose the game to a good contain from an early tank marine push. Also in one of DRG's games I did think he should have tec switched into infestors to hold of all the marine clumps. Muta/ling/bane gives the zerg more mobility and has more counter attack potential and can hold off reinforcements and with good muta micro you can simply just win the game right there and then. it also allows you to drone up new bases while keeping the tarran at his base. I'm not trying to say that infestors are not good against terran, they really are, I do think that the infestor is a really strong unit right now and a little imba in ZvP ( I am a Z player btw), but infestors are way better in the later game against terran along with broodlords which is where the infestor really stand out in the ZvT match up which is where the imbalance part of the infestor kicks in. Destiny's style in ZvT is really good, but if you watch him he really does get a late 3rd because he cannot gain map control really easily and he also tecs up to hive REALLY fast and he tries to drag the game out to the late game, (like he did against bomber and he showed us how strong his style really is), if any of you watched his stream the few days before MLG he was really looking for decent terran opponents to practice against because he felt like it was his worse match up. So saying that these top end players going Muta/ling/bane is bad against terran, it really isn't, it's actually really strong and it allows you to get to a much later game which is where you want to get to and get to a infestor broodlord composition or just make a really large muta count and  deny the terran more then 2 bases, also if you look at the 1rst game between DRG and MMA, MMA was a little all in with the push and if DRG had held he woulda won that game, so that has to be put into perspective. 

TL;DR Muta ling bane gains you map control and allows you to get to a late game and does lots of harass, while infestors take to much time to make and has a hard time stopping early tank marine contains.","1312157798"

Your argument is that because those people who drive without sleep or drunk are worse [they are] that driving stoned is ok [it's not].

Pre-emptively before you say that I am 'calling you equivalent to a murderer' [lolnope] I will instead present another analogy. Pancreatic cancer is worse than breast cancer by all measures. Neither is desirable, nor wanted. Fraud is worse than misrepresentation, both are illegal and neither is desirable. Etc.

Marijuana does not get special pleading in arguments because it's a 'good drug'. It is still a drug, and does impair you to some extent regardless of anything else.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The Moral code of the bible is not actually clear on most of the things you mention:

 * Rape: is treated as a misdomenor at best, unless the woman raped alread belongs to another man. 

 * Child abuse: spare the rod and spoil the child. The bible really treats children as their parents property. PS abortion is not actually forbidden in the bible indeed if an man thinks his wife is carrying a bastard, it is endorsed. 

 * Murder: Is forbidden however keep in mind that the bible seems to have a very narrow defintion of murder, as unlawfull killing. A whole lot of outher killing is acceptable, Including capital punishment, and the killing of slaves (providing they don't die while you are beating them, but linger for a few days first).

 * Slaver: is A ok by the bible (as long as you don't covet your neibours male or female slaves). I know you didn't mention it, but this is one of the Bibles mroe glearing moral failings.

&gt; if objective values cannot exist without God, and objective values do exist, then it follows logically that God exists.

I'm very careful about commenting on others' weight loss and physical appearance.  I don't want people to think, ""Oh, if they think I look good because I've lost weight, then if I keep losing it I'll look *really* good.""  It's far too easy to go down that road.","1312157846"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","Ok, I'm not expert, but I will give you my point of view

* As far as I know, there aren't any first world free market health care systems. I think a few countries in South America have (supposedly) free market health care, but those countries are so poor that it doesn't really work the same way (besides I'm sure there is some government interference). The reason a free market system would work, is the same reason the free market works anywhere else. [This](http://mises.org/daily/3737) is a link to Mises.org 's health care page. It has tons of links and articles on health care, and the rest of Mises.org has different articles on the free market. It should answer any of those general free market questions.
* I don't really know much about health care outcomes, but I'm usually suspicious about some of those kinds of ratings. But, the government here is alot more involved than most people realize. I could list all the ways in which government intrudes, but the list would be way too long. You can actually trace back and see that as the government got more involved over the years, the price of health care went up, and the quality went down. Its the inevitable effect of government. 
* No, not really. The only way I would be in favor of the government helping, is if the government has an overall surplus one year, then maybe they could spend that money on the people who need food or medicine or whatever. 
* The ""doc in a box"" places are great (they aren't in every state I don't think). You just pay for a simple diagnosis and they give you your medicine. It's great for simple things like strep throat. Just because government isn't providing the free health care doesn't mean that there won't be free health care. Before the government was involved, there were Catholic hospitals (and other organizations) that would give health care and medicine to people in the area who couldn't afford it. 

So basically, that was all off the top of my head. I hope it helps. Also [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foXQbmZxWYY) video is great (less than 10 mins). It's Ron Paul, and he breaks it down pretty well.","1312157851"

I'd pay a premium of around 20% for them. But the kind of prices they are charging are just way too high.

I was pricing together a Macbook Pro and compared it to my HP Envy 17. The Macbook Pro has a little better build quality, the apple branding, thunderbolt, so it's a well built machine. The Envy 17 has a better graphics card, a 120 hz 3D screen, and a two year warranty, for over $1000 less. 

I think that other vendors are realizing there is a market for premium products that they can enter and charge lower. For instance, the Envy 17 3D which I own or the XPS 15z. The Macbook still is built a little better and a little higher quality, but this is not $1000 more in value.

&gt; It shouldn't be at the churches discretion whether to comply with the laws of this country or not. The Data Protection Act is quite clear. This is a secular state and the law trumps religious belief.

Indeed, but the Data Protection Commissioner who has a role in the interpretation of the relevant legislation, doesn't appear to share your view that baptismal records should be deleted on request.  You could take a legal case to challenge the DPC's opinion in court.  And I wish that you or someone like you would, so that this can be resolved.  Until then, you really have nothing.

&gt; The fact remains that the church contends that I am a member of an organisation I completely abhor for life 

Can you provide any evidence of this?  Can you show where, having updated the church where you were baptised that you no longer wish to be considered a catholic, they still count you as one?","1312157865"

"rpg","t5_2qh2s","&gt; This is not a rules question about one particular game. It's a more general question about how you prefer shapeshifting to be handled in games you play.

Depends on the role of shapeshifting in the game.

If it's routine (e.g. a mid-level druid in D&amp;D 3.x/PF), then it's just easiest to assume that the clothes aren't left behind by the transformation (whether they're absorbed or conveniently disappeared is a flavor question you can answer yourself, so long as you follow the rules about when items offer benefits in alternate forms).

If it's a special thing (e.g. a horror game where someone's been bitten by a werewolf), then having the clothes get torn off (or stick on you in tatters, or get left behind because you shapeshifted into something small, or...) makes a lot of sense from a flavor and atmosphere perspective. Discarded or tattered clothes also provide useful clues in such a situation.","1312157870"

I've heard that kind of explanation you made from a collegue at a math department a few years ago (he was also a right winger, could there be some correlation...?) but he didn't convince me then, and I'm still not convinced. There are a few problems with the money system, which constitutes an obstacle towards progress, since the last ten years we have been like in a Status Que, or merely degeneration. There are a few big obstacles towards progress, first the amazingly blown up immaterial rights bubble to a large part offspring from US. Insane patents and ridiculous copyright laws are flourishing, but not really technological development and people's standard of living.

In fact, anyone's god could, or even perhaps an immaterial/supernatural entity or entities that no one has imagined yet. Therein lies the problem.

I think some atheists just like to point out that it's curious that people once claimed that their gods did such things as zap things into existence, but as we learned more about the universe they start to claim he acts through the framework of the universe, or perhaps even do both. Like it seems it's a disturbing trend that people will claim anything new we learn was or could have been done by their god.","1312157893"

I had forgotten I was being introduced to one girl and being set up with another, and nabbed the wrong girl.

 The guy came around after we had a drink and I professed how I was so sorry and it was an honest misunderstanding, and we're still good friends.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Well, the thing is, I was never talking about whether or not *you* have the ""right"" message. See, *everyone* seems to think that *they* have the right message. Rather, my point is that if every Christian thinks that every *other* kind of Christian has it wrong, then from any one of their perspectives, that's a terrible failure rate. 

It all seems so arbitrary. 

Now, you mentioned cults a few times. I have thought extensively on what the difference between a cult and a religion is. Please, if you have the time, read this other thread I made about that: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/j1mik/to_all_religions_are_memeplexes_and_can_be/

And let me know what you think about the ideas there. I'd love to hear what you think.

Returning to the subject, the various forms of Christianity seem completely arbitrary to me. For instance, the Catholics, for *hundreds of years* believed that Protestants were going to hell. I mean, how can the Apostle's Creed or the Nicene Creed carry any weight, then? Sure, the Catholic Church is trying their hardest to become as modern as Netflix and Google, but then all they're doing is proving my point even *more* by creating a completely new creature into the litany of *completely separate and incompatible Christian gods*: The *New* Catholic Church (the one that doesn't burn people to death). 

Another thread that I will soon be making is somewhat similar to this one: 

With all these different versions of Christianity, and also with even more different versions of Abrahamic gods, it seems rather ridiculous to me that *God seems to have made the whole Universe so that there can be some kind of ridiculous cosmic guessing game on Earth.* 

I mean, what's the point of that? I hear so often ""well, it's about faith"" or ""if God were less ambiguous, then we wouldn't need faith"". That, to me, makes it even *more ridiculous*. Pardon the silly reference, but the comedian Bill Hicks said this, and I think it's poignant:

""Well what about the dinosaurs?""

""Well, God put those there to test our faith.""

""You're testing *my* faith, dude. Doesn't that bother you *even more?* The idea that **GOD** is *fucking with you?* I mean, was he out there burying bones and chuckling ... ho ho ho I kill Me! Let's see if they believe in me *now!*""

Now, before you tell me that you believe in dinosaurs, or whatever, I want to say that I can reduce that argument to absurdity, and it's *still* the central ""message"" of faith. If you believe in dinosaurs, or evolution, or whatever, the question I still have to ask is: ""*Why*, oh *why*, would God hide from us in any way? Why would He create a Universe that looks exactly like a Universe would look if He didn't exist? Why isn't He on TV every other week talking directly to us?"" Or, if that's beneith Him, then why not at least put ireffutable evidence into His creation? You know, like a huge sign that says ""yeah, I'm real"" in space, or something. To say ""because He wants us to have faith"" just sounds, to me, like saying ""because God thinks it would be great to hold a high-stakes cosmic guessing game with our lives."" And that, my friend, is just silly. Silly. 

Maybe God exists, I don't know. I'm allowed to say I don't know. But I will say this: the idea that God *seems* to be absent because he *doesn't care* is so much more likely to me than the idea that He seems to be absent because He just wants to see if I'll believe in Him in spite of *never showing me one shred of evidence, ever, ever, ever*. But, then, the idea that He's out there, but doesn't care, has no evidence either, and is also totally inconsequential, so I just choose to disregard that possibility along with Zeus and fairies.","1312157917"

My wife and I have been married 9 years.  Lived together for about 4 years before that.

The last 5 years or so have been largely sexless.  To the extent that I honestly cannot remember the last time we had sex.

Some days I'm just fine with it.  She's a wonderful woman - truly my best friend.  The only person I can really be myself around.  The only person that I can tolerate spending any time with.  The only person I can talk to about pretty much anything.  And I feel genuinely lucky to have her by my side.

Other days...  It drives me insane.  Here's this gorgeous creature lying next to me, night after night...  We're married, it's supposed to be OK to have sex...  But I can't touch her.  Pure torture.

It might be different if I'd known what I was getting in to...  If she'd never really been into sex.  If I'd known, when I proposed, that I'd hardly be having any sex at all.  But that isn't the case.

The first several years of our relationship and marriage were full of sex.  All sorts of fun.  We've got a toybox stuffed full of interesting gizmos and gadgets from those days.  And that just makes things even harder to deal with.","1312157920"

All I can say to my defense is that I was caught off guard and ran, and after a few moments realized exactly what was happening, so I tried to pursue them because not only were they fucking me over, they were putting me in a very bad position. They eluded me though, having had a head start. I'm not saying what I did was right, only that I didn't have any intention of doing anything wrong, and that my own confusion (and slight inebriation) caused me to not fully grasp the situation at the onset.

I think it would take fairly large presence of mind to be like ""oh, those two guys are running away, guess I'll cough up 50 bucks plus tip that I don't have!"" I wanted to figure out what was going on, I figured it out, I tried to catch up to them to stop them for at least ten bucks or something, and I failed. I walked back to where it happened and was apprehended, willingly paid, and got taken home. I know doing the right thing after getting caught isn't the same as doing the right thing, but I feel like I was caught committing a crime I had zero intent of committing, and immediately paid up for it.

Near the end of the Third Age, the One Ring of Sauron resurfaced by way of Bilbo Baggins and Gandalf, having recovered it from under the Misty Mountains. During the Council at Rivendell, it was decided that the Ring, a dangerous and terrible artifact, holding all the malice and will of the Dark Lord, Sauron, must be destroyed. While the members of the council argued who would take it into the enemy land of Mordor, where it could be destroyed, it was the diminutive hobbit, Frodo Baggins, who stood and proclaimed ""I will take the Ring.""


Was it naivety or shear courage that lead Frodo to take the task? His fortitude would be tested many times, before even reaching the Council where he decided to take the burden. The first attempt of the Dark Lord to recover the Ring was at Weathertop Hill, where Frodo’s party was attacked by the horrible Nazgul and Frodo was stabbed with a Morgul blade, a poisoned wound that would long haunt him. Despite experiencing firsthand the danger of possessing the Ring, Frodo chose to bear it into the east.


After the Council, Frodo had many companions. The first to fall was Gandalf, in the depths of Moria, battling the Balrog called Durin’s Bane. Despite this terrible blow, the wizard had seemingly given his life so that the fellowship could persevere, and so Frodo knew he must. Later, after refusing to surrender his burden to his companion Boromir, fearing the evil that might come, Frodo chose to depart on his own toward Mordor. He was, however, discovered by Samwise Gamgee, who insisted on accompanying him. Surely this was a stroke of luck, as who could say which of the challenges to come may have defeated him without the support of his friend Sam.


Soon, Frodo and Sam were attacked by Gollum, a former possessor of the Ring. In Gollum we see the corruption wrought by the ring firsthand; Gollum was once a hobbit, much like Frodo and Sam, but had become a twisted, wretched creature, full of deceit and hate, all-consumed by desire for the Ring. The supernatural corruption that ravaged Gollum is the same kind Frodo resists every moment he carries the Ring.


Frodo tamed Gollum and forced him to guide them into Mordor. Many dangers followed before Gollum was able to lure the hobbits into a trap. He directed them into a tunnel atop the Endless Stair, where they were forced to confront the terrible spider Shelob. Here, Frodo was poisoned by the spider and knocked unconscious, yet Sam was able to drive the creature off. Frodo was taken by orcs and rescued by Sam. Only by the grace of Sam was Frodo able to continue his journey. 


The two were now in the heart of Mordor. Crossing the lifeless plateau of Gorgoroth, the pair ran out of water, and left their supplies behind. As they grew ever closer to the ghost of Sauron in his tower, Barad-dûr, Frodo grew sicker and weaker. Nevertheless, with the aid of Sam he carried on toward the volcanic Orodruin, where at last Frodo reached the fiery chasm deep within where the Ring, and all of Sauron that was within it, could at last be destroyed. Only then, in the very heart of Sauron's strength, did Frodo give in to the will of the Ring and claim it for his own. There, Gollum, consumed by his ancient lust for the Ring, reappeared and attacked Frodo, bit off the ring and, in his glee, danced by the Crack of Doom, slipped and fell into its molten depths, ring and all.


Despite being pursued by all the fury of the most malignant force in all Middle Earth, losing friends, deceived by others, fighting enemies and terrible monsters all along the way, Frodo was able to bring the Ring to its destruction. It was his great inner strength that protected him from greed and lust for power presented by the Ring, not to mention its supernatural allure, the will of the Dark Lord yearning to return to its master. It was this inner strength, and the support of his closest friend, Sam, and the aid of many other friends, that kept him from giving up. 


The hobbits were rescued by the eagle Thorondor and brought back to Minis Tirith where they were healed and refreshed before returning home to the Shire. There, Frodo lived for a time, still pained by the scars received during his journey. For his service as a Ringbearer, Frodo was granted access to Valinor, the paradise across the Western Sea reserved for the retirement of the Elves, and the home of the god-like Vala. It is here, it can be assumed, Frodo lived out the rest of his life in peace and delight.

RjShi-I have been with a previous reddit team that I had resigned from. Therefore, I have experience with playing in a tournament and ideally know the current meta fairly well.

I am currently 1300 elo but I don't think that this elo reflects on my performance. I've given up trying to raise ever since I had played with my former team. I main Warwick jungle (and top lane LOL) and Amumu jungle. 

In my opinion, I believe I am best in my jungling. Whoever you can think of, I can jungle it. :) I also have good experience with playing support and top lane third.

Hopefully, someone will see this :). I have about 1000 games under my belt at the moment. I'm looking to bring some thrill back into my league of legends experience.","1312157933"

Dear god, you're only a junior! Please, change. I did it my junior year, for a major that was supposed to lead me to a master's and then my dream job. Then, I got laid off from my dream field where I had been working my way up, and the market for my job (and any future in it) tanked. I should have changed my major then and there (which would have been my senior year), and stayed an extra year or two to finish it. 

Seriously, don't leave with a degree you don't want while it's still so easy to change. Once you graduate with that degree, it is SO MUCH HARDER to go back.","1312157952"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","I didn't make that job up. I live fairly close to a well known clinic, and that's what people in the area with a masters in psych do when working towards their doc if they didn't take the research route. I'm switching to a larger university this year because I wanted to have my education focus more on brain anatomy than my other school did, but even at that school, older members of the psych club on campus all had jobs in their related fields of interest. Psychology is like pre-med in a lot of ways in the sense that it is very tracked. Your undergraduate means nothing except a time where you should be networking and interning, you go on to masters. You get a job as an underling in research (which there is always demand since it is often cheaper and more efficient to pay 3 masters degrees than it is to pay 1 PHD) or do patient screening for actual psychologists at a clinic. You do this while working on your thesis, and then you obtain doc and go on to conduct your own research through a university, set up your own private practice (which you can now do), or work at a big clinic (which I'm close to). It's not a degree that is really thrust into any private sector where the degree holder has to demonstrate how their skills apply directly to say banking or network security or any other unrelated job. It's really contained. If one makes the attempt to meet all their professors as a psych major, odds are, they will have a relevant job if they choose to stay the course.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","First and foremost, thanks for a reasonable response! 

I wasn't supporting the Christian's response, which is why I called it a ""hissy fit"", and hopefully it was inferred that s/he is also part of the ""hate"" mentioned. Anyways, sometimes you say offensive things and unknown parties overhear. It happens. But that's the critical moment. The Christian bitched (perhaps somewhat rightly, maybe not), but the response to that was to insult and make more jokes with the intent to offend. I think OP failed good social etiquette at that point.

OP posted this rage comic most likely thinking this was good behavior, somehow praise-worthy, or somehow deserving of sympathy for her. It seems most of /r/atheism agrees with one or more of those. Whatever. I don't think it is any of those, so I'm posting on behalf of whatever subset of /r/atheism still believes in acting decent with other human beings.","1312157965"

"Slender_Man","t5_2s4md","""Listen up and listen close, as I tell you the story of the slender man.

Nobody knows from whence he came, but he has been depicted in a particular German woodcutting, and is the subject of an old German superstition. That children that lie to their parents are stolen away in the night by the slender man, and neither man nor beast can stop him.

The slender man himself, however, is not so easily satisfied. The slenderman chooses his prey based on many a condition. Some, he hunts, for they fear him. Some, he hunts, for they seek to know more about him, some, he hunts, for sport.

The slender man is not a beast like any other, however, he has no great maw or slavering howl, no vicious claws or furred flesh, the slender man is...intelligent, cunning, ruthless.

Should you look upon the slender man, you would see a man with unnatural height, a featureless face that stares with quiet intensity, and an impeccable suit. No, do not laugh, do not giggle, the slender man is not mocked, not to be mocked, it is unwise to arouse his wrath.

The slender man is unique in the sense that he does not feed, not that we know of, he does not sleep in any way we would recognise, and he does not feel in any way we would comprehend. The slender man enjoys toying with the prey he has chosen, sometimes stalking for months, appearing in flashes in the corner of their eyes, or off in the distance, staring his usual, quiet, serene stare. The calmest stare in the world, the stare with no facial expression, for he has nothing to express with. Those that have seen him report a lack of eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or hair. Eyebrows and facial hair is alien to him, the colour of his flesh, if indeed it is flesh, is akin to that of an albino, and while he bears no marks, one symbol and one symbol alone expresses his influence, a single circle, with a great ""X"" scrawled through the centre. 

The slender man has been seen in many areas other than Europe, lately he seems to be on a spree in central America. Demonstrating his ability to disable or distort various types of electronics simply by being in their presence, oftentimes those in particular that seek to record his image. However, images of the slender man exist, and are freely available, online, scrawled on walls by his victims, but know this. When you gaze upon a likeness of the slender man, even a crude scrawl by a desperate victim breathing his last breath, the slender man knows you, and the slender man does not keep company.

The slender man seeks his prey relentlessly, but what is unclear is precisely what he chooses to do with them. One of his victims was discovered dead, yes, but the slender man has taken many victims, and has been walking this earth for, according to the German Woodcarvings, at least five centuries. Is it possible the slender man is an agent of heaven? Of hell? Of extraterrestrials? Or perhaps a combined force of damned spirits longing for life, for human contact. It is impossible to say.

Solid locks and walls do not seem to restrict him, and he has been known to travel on his own across countrysides and borders as quickly as his prey can in a car, on a train, or on a plane. The slender man has no fixed abode, no easily avoided cave or lair. The slender man is not a beast, the slender man is calculating and cold.

How do you avoid this monstrosity? He that inspires rampant coughing in those he is hunting, particularly when he is near? The simple answer is, you do not. Once the slender man has set his sightless sights upon you, it is only a matter of time. Some have come to survive by endlessly fleeing, but sooner or later they tire, or they make a mistake, or, worst yet, the slender man simply becomes bored with pretending to be outrun. Othertimes people attempt to take his likeness in the form of crude worship, perhaps the slender man has a sense of irony about him, that these people emulate what commands the fear of men and beasts alike? as these people do not seem to be struck down quite so frequently, and yet they are quite mad, I assure you.

This last part, my friends, is the part you should pay heed to. Even if you know nothing else, know this. The slender man has no fixed habitat, but the slender man was originally seen in forests, areas with dense trees, and even parks. The slender man seems to, in one way or another, be drawn to such places. 

Sleep soundly, sleep quietly, and should you hear footsteps, or feel eyes upon you, do not, whatever you do, open your eyes.

The slender man does not like to be looked at. The slender man does not like it at all.","1312157969"

The actual electron flow (the marbles in my analogy) actually flow from negative to positive. 

&gt;From the [Wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current) entry:

&gt; In metallic solids, electricity flows by means of electrons, from lower to higher electrical potential. In other media, any stream of charged objects may constitute an electric current. To provide a definition of current that is independent of the type of charge carriers flowing, conventional current is defined to flow in the same direction as positive charges. So in metals where the charge carriers (electrons) are negative, conventional current flows in the opposite direction as the electrons.

I don't want to see him because I am afraid of falling for him again but at the same time I do want to see him just to see if there is something big there and we could end up together.

Not religion! Even then, there is no _bias_ necessarily towards the Palestinians because of their skin color, origin, etc. The security restrictions, incursions into Palestinian territory are all responsive to militant attacks by Palestinians. The question of land holdings must obviously be settled but do not, by any means, bring racism into this. It is truly not the case. Having lived in Israel myself I can tell you some of my closest friends were Palestinians and were seamlessly integrated into the society. You neglect to see that Israel, while being an overtly Jewish state, is actually one comprised of any vast number of religions. There is an enormous Islamic population in Israel. In fact, 16% of Israel's total population is Islamic. The struggle is between two groups, not two religions. There is, I'm sure, some hatred on both sides for the other, being that the religious divide is so obvious. But that is not the overt issue.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","On one hand we have:

Scenario 1: Our ancestors were close to God and knew God and received scriptures from him. Somewhere down the line, due to errors in record keeping and Satan's interference, things changed.

On the other hand we have:

Scenario 2: In the ancient times, different people on different parts of the Earth came up with their ideas of God as a means to explain what was unknown to them, like diseases, famines, eclipses, volcanoes, etc and created concepts like afterlife to cope with the stress of losing loved ones.

Which is more likely to have happened? While you would say Scenario 1, I say it's Scenario 2. Also, if you study how the human brain has evolved (neurobiology) if you study evolutionary psychology, if you study history of various religions, if you study the cave paintings done by our ancestors (archeological evidence)... they all point to the second scenario... that as we evolved from lower life forms, we developed consciousness and self awareness, we had opened our eyes and saw a world/universe that we did not understand.

This is especially true when you are trying to discuss political issues in a public forum where anonymity is the norm.  Beyond that... while there can be places like women's shelters for domestic abuse, those places are primarily safe in the literal physical sense.  There is a zero tolerance policy for actual physical violence.  When posting on an internet forum there is not nearly the same threat of physical violence because it's not an actual space at all.  And if you truly want to understand the positions of your political opponents you can allow them to speak their minds (no matter how polluted) and you don't have to really worry about them reaching through the fiber optic cables and punching you.  But the bottom line is that you shouldn't expect or demand a public internet forum to be free of every word and idea you dislike -- especially if you are interested in learning, discussing, and debating.  And that's what I, personally, think an internet forum should be about.  ","1312158012"

I searched for something to torrent which led to a private site.  They had an interview process for handing out invites (do you understand the basic rules, FAQ, ratio system, etc) in their IRC channel.  I went through that, but stayed in the channel and was always willing to help anyone else the best I could if staff or ops weren't around.  They picked up on that and kept promoting me within IRC.

One of the staff members of this site was in the midst of creating a new site with similar content, and asked me to be involved.  I was part of the pre-launching process and was quickly promoted through the ranks there, and eventually ended up at SysOp where I stayed for two and a half years.

During this time, I had good networking with staff members of other sites, which led me to becoming a Senior Admin on another site simultaneously. 

Probably more than you wanted to know, but I wanted to show that in one case I didn't know anyone but the second case arose through networking during the first.  ","1312158021"

Edit:

First glance says that this is due to this [Reddit code fix](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/commit/b6361cd831464ab33eab352d05e6e8c2d4523353) to make the API return more sane results, I'll see how Reddit is Fun was overriding this to try to fix the discrepancies in Reddit's JSON API before this fix.

Edit #2:
This is a result of what the Reddit API actually returns itself, the URL attribute of /r/Android.json for this thread is:

    ""url"":""http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/r/Android/comments/j4yav/congratulations_swiftkey_x_and_reddit_is_fun/""

Something like, count the number of X on some mural, and that number will be one digit of the coords.  I think a big thing missing from lots of caches is the location.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","devicerandom touched on this: That this can be seen as a question that asks:
""Why is the human scale of length and time perception 3 billionths of the speed of light.""  (Using human scale as order 1m and 1s ~= 1m/s)

First of all - our scale systems are arbitrary - this all makes more sense if you use [natural units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_units) where the speed of light is 1

Our human 'speed scale' is determined by what a self aware system needs: 

* Time (amount of events) needed to integrate a conscious state.
* An amount of matter of a certain size (number of parts) needed to do that. 

So the human scale is a multiplicative factor on top of more fundamental scales of the speed of chemical interactions and the sizes of atoms. 

The size of atoms is due to the interplay of the electromagnetic force and quantum mechanics - summarized in the [bohr radius](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_radius) which gives the size of a hydrogen atom. In natural units it is 1/(Mass electron * strength of electromagnetism) 
So the size of atoms depends of mass of electron and strength of electromagnetism.

The speed of chemical interactions is a function the forces and masses involved (F=ma roughly!). The mass involved is the proton mass, which is most of the mass of an atom. The forces are electromagnetic - the strength of which we already saw came in to the size of atoms. 

So - at the end of the day we have electron interactions pulling around protons, the 'feature size' of which is due to electron mass and electromagnetic strength, and the 'feature speed' is due to the mass of the proton. Now the mass of the proton is complicated - it's mainly due to forces within it rather than the mass of it's constituent parts - so it's scale is due to the scale of those forces. We think those forces (QCD - strong force) can be unified with electromagnetism. So at the end of the day the mass of the proton is related to the strength of that unified force (a [GUT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory) force)

So we are left with the GUT force strength and the mass of the electron.
In natural units the speed of light is 1 remember, and the mass of the electron is sqrt(gravity coupling constant)
or you can think of it as electron mass is proportional to the strength of gravity!

The constants for the force strengths are:

* Electromagnetism: [7.2973525698(24)×10-3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-structure_constant)
* Gravity: [1.75 x 10-45](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_coupling_constant)

So the real question is... Why is gravity so weak? Which is a real problem in physics!

I'm in no way an expert on a lot of this - please tell me if I am wrong.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I think some people want to take it a step beyond that, so that you specify the what but not the how.  Possibly a bit of a contrived example, but suppose you have an array of integers and you want them in order.  The regular approach is that you either write a sorting algorithm or call a pre-written one.  The automatic programming approach might be that you specify a property that the data structure needs to have, and the code generator applies (or even invents) a sorting algorithm.  So, you'd feed it input something like this:

* input: an array A
* output: an array B
* property: every element in A has a corresponding equivalent element in B
* property: every element in B has a corresponding equivalent element in A
* property: for all B[i] and B[j], i &lt; j implies B[i] &lt; B[j]

Given that, a smart enough AI should be able to spit out a sort.  Except of course that I screwed up the spec.  If A has a repeated element, it doesn't violate the spec if B only has copy of that.  At least not the way I worded it.","1312158083"

"cordcutters","t5_2sa6y","I would shy away from the Roku since I see people complain about the bugginess of home media streaming options like PlayOn and Plex. I can't comment about the Revue since I've never used one. But considering how much the price has dropped, it may be worth buying one to test and holding onto the receipt.

If I were doing your setup, I would spring for a Boxee Box. When I was first looking into cord-cutting, I went the Roku route. But I was dissatisfied with the dearth of codec support on the XDS (now the XS) and the fact that I'd have to pay to purchase an additional computer for the media center if I went the PlayOn route. All I have is an old PowerPC Mac laptop.

The Boxee Box did everything I wanted cheaply, plus it has native support for SMB shares. I can load movies onto the hard drive and stream them to the Boxee. Eventually I'll buy a dedicated NAS for that job since I need a proper file backup anyway. It's twice as expensive as the Roku, but it works. It hasn't choked on anything yet. It plays 1080p mkv files just fine, which I've been told the Roku can't do. A quick google suggests others have gotten PlayOn to work with the Boxee via UPnP too.

If you're willing to spend twice as much, go with Boxee Box.","1312158103"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","dr's are ass holes when it comes to knee problems... or so its been my experience.  If its been more than 2 months since you initialy hurt the knee, if its poping, locking up or just killing you all the time. go back to the dr and ask for an MRI. its the only way to see the soft tissue like cartilage and make sure its not torn as well as the ligaments. 

I got the round about from 4 dr's a few years back for over 6 months, went to pt and everything... they all said well i couldnt do my martial arts training, hiking and everything else if i had a structural knee problem. Finally ordered them to give me the mri and when i saw the surgeon he pulled out the scan from an envelope for the first time and his eyes bugged out...

look into taking glucosamine chondroiten pills ( it will take a month or so of regular use for it to make an effect)
also look up a book called ""heal your knees""

ps: knee circles are a very light joint warm up that causes your joint capsule in your knee to loosen up as well as produce synovial fluid which lubricates the cartiledge and nourishes it. it will take time but doing knee circles regularly is the most natural way to heal a knee problem.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Thunder is caused directly by lightning. 

Now, any sound that you hear is actually caused by the *vibration*, or movement, of air. When a bolt of lightning shoots through the air, the air that it goes through gets very, VERY hot. And, like when you're feeling hot during the summer and you don't want to be too close to other people, the air wants to move far away from the hot place (where the lightning struck) very quickly. But, there's a problem: there are a whole lot of little molecules (pieces) of air around. So, when the air that got heated up by the lightning tries to expand away, it pushes and shoves other molecules of air out of the way. This causes the same type of vibration in the air that any other sound would make, except it happens much, much faster. And, as you probably know, it is much, **much** louder! That's why it can also sometimes take a while before you hear the thunder after you see the lightning. The waves of pushing and shoving air have to travel all the way from where the lightning struck to an area where you can hear them. And that is how thunder works :)","1312158127"

In some ways, it's inconsistent with anarchism in that the true goal of an anarchist should be to abolish the system, not improve it.  But that's abstract and doesn't really bother me.  In any event, it's hard to find paid work abolishing the system.  

It's consistent with anarchism in that it empowers people and gives them access to a justice system that is normally unnavigable for poor people.  It helps people stand up for their own motherfucking RIGHTS, ON THEIR OWN!  I'm pretty proud of it and also incredibly fortunate to be able to do this, despite the low pay (I used to have a high paying, soul-sucking job, and I am immeasurably happier now).

If you can find a job that is fulfilling and meaningful, something that you think contributes a net positive to society, something that mostly jives with your ideals, consider yourself lucky.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","You can get good INSURANCE for a whole family for only $150 or so a month.   Real insurance is just-in-case, not wipe your runny nose.   That's one of the problems.  Our parents had health 'insurance' for emergencies, hospital care etc, and paid for everything else themselves and wonder of wonders routine stuff was not that expensive because real people were paying for it with their own money. There was even non-profit coop insurance called mutuals that worked like the insurance equiv of credit unions.  But the big for profits were able to get regulations passed to force most of them out of the market. 

If you want to know what a free market looks like your gonna have to go a generation back before medicare, before social security got involved in disability health coverage, and before the growth of the pay-everything health insurance companies.  


Learn about HCAs and get a plan like that and you can find you can save lots of money by taking back control of your healthcare out of the hands of the nose wiping insurance companies.

This is why I recommend the Tupperware box, after a few hours the humidity in the box will stabilize and you'll have a good idea of how much moisture is left in the sticks. Then you slowly start increasing the humidity. 

Cedar is really good at maintaining a humidity, it releases and absorbs continuously, resulting in varying humidity. These slight variations can damage a cigar that's being rehumidified. In a Tupperware box the humidity will continue to increase (provided a good seal), once you get it to 70% in a plastic box, just maintain it there.

""Cannabis alone, particularly in low doses, has little effect on the skills involved in automobile driving.""

""Whereas these results indicate a 'change' from normal conditions, they do not necessarily reflect 'impairment' in terms of performance effectiveness since few studies report increased accident risk.""

""There is no evidence that consumption of cannabis alone increases the risk of culpability for traffic crash fatalities or injuries for which hospitalization occurs, and may reduce those risks.""

""**The THC-only drivers had a responsibility rate below that of the drugfree drivers.** … While the difference was not statistically significant, there was no indication that cannabis by itself was a cause of fatal crashes.""

This was the bank’s way of making sure you had adequate skin in the game and started off with enough equity that, if you ran into payment problems, the bank wouldn’t end up with a house worth less than the mortgage.

It was also a way of observing (from the records of how the 20% down-payment was accumulates) whether the borrow had the financial *discipline* and stability necessary to pay off a mortgage.

From what I can tell, of those three only SPUSA is really a ""party"", DSA and SDUSA are more advocacy groups that don't run candidates. And of those two groups, DSA tends to be a Democratic Party pressure group and SDUSA (which is nearly defunct, thank goodness) is right wing, supporting the ""War on Terror"" and neoliberal third-way politics.

My top 3 would be Law, Smoker then a tie between Crocodile, Ace and Zoro (if I had to make a top 5, the number 4 and 5 would be whoever I didn't pick for number 3).  Well, looking at it I guess I do have some sort of theme.  Four of those 5 are Devil Fruit users, three of which are Logia with cool elements in my opinion.  Especially Smoker and Crocodile.  Before One Piece, I never really thought of smoke and sand as anything more than byproducts of other elements.  Now I know, set in the right context, they can fuck your shit up.  

For Law being number 1, it's because we don't know anything about him.  He's called the ""Surgeon of Death"" and we have no idea why.  We don't even know what his Devil Fruit is called.  

For Ace, it's because I like fire, it's one of my favorite elements (behind wind, which doesn't have an official DF in One Piece...yet).

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'll see if I can sum this up properly.  

To start *no one really knows* how lightning works. There's a lot of guesses that people try to test out, but figuring out how it occurs in nature is difficult because it's hard to predict how it will occur and exactly where. That's also why it's hard to harness for energy use.  

What they do know is that lightning is basically an electric discharge from point A (in the clouds) to point B (the ground/tree/person/whatever). That means that there had to be an electric field; the negatively charged particles all grouped up on one side, and the positively charged particles grouped up on the other side. People debate if the field is just in the clouds or if it's the entire area of clouds, air, and ground where lightning occurs.  

For the discharge to happen, there has to be a path, which is why lightning looks like a bunch of funky veins. That path is basically where a whole bunch of atoms lined up *just* right so that it's like a slide for the most highly charged atoms to slide around on. They do it so fast and together have so much energy, the electrical charge gives off light while it goes on the slide. That's lightning.  

Now for thunder. Since lightning happens really fast and is a bunch of energy in one long line, it literally superheats the slide. It basically causes a shockwave because the air expands with heat, and it's so fast it pushes any air that isn't as hot yet further out. (FYI, it's how sonic booms work.) The sound you hear of the air reacting to the heating is thunder.  

There's a crazy number of different types of lightning, all categorized by where they start and where they end more than anything else. They all work in the same way as far as people know. The two that are most different are negative lightning (the most common type) and positive lightning. Positive lightning is when the positive charge before a strike is at the top of the very front thunderstorm cloud (the anvil). It's bigger, blue, and can strike miles ahead of the storm. It hits 5-6 times harder (voltage, which is the difference in charge the lightning has compared to everything around it) and lasts up to 10 times longer (meaning you can actually stare at it if you catch it). It's so strong, it gives off radio waves, not just heat and light. It's only a small portion of lightning though, they think it's maybe 1/20 at best.   

Now for some creepy stuff. Airplanes *do* get hit by lightning, but they're usually designed to keep the strike from affecting them so much that it makes them crash. They still try to avoid a thunderstorm if they can help it, but more because of air currents and other flying issues that storms bring. What's scary is most airplanes can't handle a positive lightning strike, so they'll definitely avoid the big anvil cloud.   

As for why lightning usually doesn't hit the flat ground, when it's reaching the end of the slide, it will usually hit the highest thing near the end of the slide. It can't give off all the extra energy and charge into the air (it just pushed the air away by superheating it), so the very minor electric field given off by the tallest thing nearby becomes attractive enough to hit. It's like when a kid's on a swing and is going to jump off, they usually aim for some arbitary nearby target rather than nothing at all. Let's say it hits a tree (which is absurdly common, since they're so tall). Trees *suck* at conducting electricity, especially if they have sap. They suck so bad, the electricity basically stops dead, resulting in a *lot* of heat being given off, causing all the moisture in the tree to immediately vaporize into steam and break apart the tree. Since it's a bunch of moisture (water) pushing out really fast, the trees may not have enough oxygen around for the tree to light on fire, so it doesn't even burn the tree, it just turns it into big pieces of firewood.  

Hopefully that encompassed all your questions. Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong (I had indeed thought it was plasma before).

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","&gt;  web design is wireframing/planning/mocking up in PSD

No, this is called print design. Devices do not have fixed resolutions. Do not display fonts the same way. Some anti-alias, some don't. Content from a site needs to be indexed. The font-grids and spacings need to be things that are actually doable in CSS.

&gt;Majority is the planning and creation of what the site will look like and all of the considerations for it.

Exactly. And none of that can actually be done in PSD. If not against creating a visual mockup (wireframing). But if the PSD is supposed to convey a look'n'feel .. pick the fonts, the colors .. even the spacing between the letters and paragraphs ..  then you are working backwards.

&gt;Personally, I'm much more frontend, working in the browser utilizing html/css/js/general php to actually craft the website to look like what the web designer envisioned and mocked up.

Then you are the actual web designer here, that has to entertain a print-designer that doesn't actually want to be qualified for his/her job. Read up on composition, color and typography and get rid of the dinasour.

You are working in exactly the right toolchain to do the exploration phase. Hmm .. a darker menu .. with more spacing .. how would that look on [insert list of devices here]. Can we use this font? What about a web font? How does that render in Safari/Webkit/Firefox .. ? Does the OS settings of anti-aliasing play a role? Etc, etc. etc.

All of this should reinforce and inform the design choices.

There are far more unknowns than knowns in this case, and the OP is hardly in any position to elucidate all of them. You say it's obvious the doctor didn't warn her of anything. I disagree. It's far more likely that he sat her down at a pre-op visit and went through ""informed consent,"" during which ""septic joint"" was almost certainly on the list of possible negative outcomes. If the surgeon didn't do that - he's a moron and the case is closed before it's even opened, from a legal perspective. But it's standard practice, so odds are pretty good that he did. 

Next: Where did the OP find out about this ""showing off"" angle? Another doctor? The Op notes? It is likely here-say. It's very common that surgeons have students following them around - and medical students are the lowest on the totem pole, and the least likely to be shown off to. It seems unlikely that he was actually grandstanding for purposes of the students. 

Furthermore, it was assuredly not the surgeon's ego that caused him to revise the hip - that's standard practice for an orthopedist to revise a poor outcome. In fact, many competing orthopedists will not touch a joint that has been touched by another surgeon, until there's been at least one other attempt at repair. What you interpreted as ""ego"" is really known as ""due diligence."" 

My point of all this is, you don't know enough about the case or the practice of medicine to be in any position to give the OP the advice you're giving. You're projecting a heck of a lot onto the surgeon, and reinforcing a number of ideas to the OP to go full bore, which may actually hurt her case. ","1312158258"

The only really difference is that along with the functionality of the product we're focusing on looks as well which is why we've decided to go with ceramic over any other material, we did product testing with a small group of friends where we tested various materials, glasses, ceramics and plastics and it seemed like people really enjoyed the look of the ceramics the most. Hence the price tag that we've attached to it. The $10 would be an average price that we'd be looking at including shipping. I'd say that if we were to do local pickups such as detroit and the like, it'd be around $6 per. Dunno where i'd put a price break at on that if someone was to purchase in bulk.

But you get the general idea, we want it to be functional and also look like a really nice piece of ceramic ware, like how some people have their ceramic beer mugs that they love showing off, we'd like people to have this ceramic ashtray they like showing off because of the look.","1312158262"

I didn't mind it at first...and then I heard it over and over and over again for the past 2 years.  Now I can't stand it and when I see someone use it I have less respect for them.

There are better terms.  Uncle Tom works pretty fucking well, IMO.  But, if you're not comfortable with that given its roots, [Dan Savage has supplied a fitting alternative](http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2011/07/21/to-tell-the-truth): castrati (castrato).  Though I'm uncomfortable with ""Uncle Tom"" as there's an implied assertion that the struggle for men's rights is somehow on par with the struggle for black rights (it's not), I do feel it's superior to castrato, and far superior to mangina.  ...perhaps some variation of ""Uncle Tom"" would retain the indictment of the subservience, without implying both issues are comparable (maybe ""Uncle Hugo"", or ""Uncle David"", which incorporates a nice jab at the archetype embodied by Schwyzer and Futrelle).","1312158263"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Let's consider how the body is capable of running first:  In order to accelerate forward, you have to be able to generate force against the ground (F=ma).  We assume here that the 100m sprint is limited by the body's ability to accelerate forward (fatigue doesn't enter the equation).

The magnitude of that force is proportional to the friction at the foot/ground interface, i.e you need friction in order to keep from slipping (think about how fast you can sprint barefoot on ice vs. how fast you can sprint with track spikes on a rubberized track).  So, the greater the friction the more you can accelerate.

Friction is itself proportional to the normal force directed down to the surface.  On earth this is generally the force of gravity pulling your body's mass down to the ground.  This is the parameter that you are trying to change in order to maximize forward acceleration.  

Given that we already demonstrated that you need friction to push yourself forward, would you expect more or less gravity to help you run the fastest 100m?  I think if you follow this logic you can see that, in fact, having more gravitational force pulling your feet down in contact with the ground will help you run faster.  It is a bit counterintuitive, but perhaps if you look back at footage of astronauts on the moon you will see how difficult it was for them to 'run'.  There wasn't enough gravity to keep them planted.  Instead they had to keep hopping from place to place, which is inefficient since most of your energy is spent lifting you up instead of forward.","1312158268"

One guy at my gym overheard me talking to another guy about losing weight, and started to give me advice, I told him ive lost over 70lbs already and he just stopped.

I see no reason for it to even come up in general conversation. If you talk about -trying- to do something, people want to help, and tons of people think they know the keys to weight loss and fitness because its written about in magazines and online so much. If you don't talk about it (because really, what good can come of it unless you are asking for advice?).

I do talk about my workouts with people, because I like to hear what others do. I have a workout program that works well for me, but im interested in learning more based on others results.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","Food for thought:

It's quite natural and often compulsory to make noises when an object is being rammed into your body. If you are being penetrated, the mechanical action of each thrust pumps the bellows of your vocal tract. Moans, screams, grunts and heavy breathing are nearly automatic, and all you really have to do is like *let it out.* You can pretty much just open your mouth and let out the sounds. This seems to lead women to believe that a quiet man is holding back those sounds, when in fact his body is simply not being made to produce them. What can I tell you? We live in an artificially equalized world where men and women are expected to mirror experiences which are actually real damn different. 

However! A strap-on is a great equalizer. If you manage to catch your breath, you can ask her why she's not being more vocal, even with the clit vibe, and maybe then you'll both laugh, but ultimately **you'll probably just have to join the throng of men who've had to learn how to fake it.** Godspeed.","1312158282"

Have you decided on a medium yet? I've had my best results with coco coir. It's really simple and cheap to grow in with all the benefits of other hydroponic methods.

Start with good clones/seeds. Whatever strains you decide to grow after considering yield, flowering time &amp; medicinal properties, get them from a reputable source. You'll want to be sure of your quality and consistency if you're gonna donate to a good dispensary out here.

Don't burn your fucking new house down. Consider how many amps you'll be using for your setup. Watts/Voltage gives you amps. American homes are usually 120v, so a 1000watt ballast will be 8.33 amps. Your average home has 200 amps total, each circuit is 15 or 20 amps, washer/dryer circuit is usually more. For continuos use stay around 85% of a circuits capacity. So spread the electrical load around or use washer/dryer panel.

I think we will be seeing this new style a lot in tournies, and Zerg players probably will be able to figure it how to shut down this BO within about 3 weeks. Personally, I'm not sure what you can do to shut down the second marine hellion timing push, though. I don't think Roach Baneling would work too well because of how gas intensive it is(as well as Marines somewhat countering roaches in large numbers when backed by stim and medivacs), and lings are obviously useless vs this. I'm looking forward to seeing how this turns out. But hopefully we can all agree this doesn't need to be patched, and it is stoppable.","1312158297"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Agree with *EagleFalconn* on all of the above/below.

The science and claims behind conditioners and anti-frizz products are not as tenuous as you might first assume. Some conditioners actual use [*quaternary ammonium salts (quats)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quats) for their [anti-static](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antistatic_agent) properties. As the quats used possess positive charge, they negate the negative static charge that accumulates in hair, thus preventing the 'frizz'.

I'm a type1, and the heavy whipping cream (the giant carton you can get at Costco) never affects my bloodsugar.  The fat also keeps me from getting snacky from the coffee.  My cholesterol numbers have been good too.

When you say ""1 carb per packet"", do you mean 1g of carb, or 1 carb choice?

The 3rd wave revolves a lot around correcting this, but the last generation mostly was focused on creating equalities for ""visible"" women-- that is, white, straight women-- and generally failed to help WoC or women on the queer spectrum. (The problem with queer women, lesbians in particular, seems to be related to the stereotype of feminists being man-hating lesbians; feminists often try/tried so hard to not be man-hating lesbians that they alienated the actual lesbians, which is where the super extreme stuff like lesbian separatism comes from.)","1312158341"

I mean, I'm not perfect. Sometimes I'll slip and forget, or I just plain don't know that a word is considered offensive. But if someone tells me that they don't like something I just said, I listen to their reasoning and I take it into account.

Not at all.  I stumbled across that site a while ago and bookmarked it.  It's the best PSU review resource I know of.  I tend to bookmark nerdy stuff like that when I come across it, you know, stuff you'll probably never use like [a RAM chip OEM list](http://ramlist.i4memory.com/ddr3/).

&gt; Also PSU calculators are unreliable, the Watt draw you see in review is from the wall which doesn't factor in efficiency so sometimes those aren't good indicators either.

True, they shouldn't be taken as gospel truth, but they tend to give you a good idea of a general baseline, especially since they usually assume your PSU is right around the baseline 80+ range and any good PSU should be at least 80+ certified.  Of course, if you wanted to get super technical about loads, you would also have to have people start discussing the ambient temp of the room in which the computer will be located. I don't mean to diminish Phaedrus2129's thread, as it's great, but PSU calculators can be very useful tools sometimes too.","1312158354"

The next time it comes up to a public vote there needs to be more visible voting drives on all the campuses for it. In order to not repeat the same results as the last vote. The apathy was thinking there was going to be a landslide 'The youth group is so large, so It'll pass without me I don't need to go'. 

This ""war"" is killing us financially and in unnecessary human costs as well. This needs to stop, The old people of my generation and the one before me are making money hand over fist off of this war.

You're right, the 50mm prime means that I often had to push people back to take photos at a distance, and about half a dozen optimal shots were bad because other people walked into the frame. My lens happens to have a very narrow depth of focus, so if I didn't focus straight onto the face and instead the costume, sometimes the face would be blurred out. On the other hand, thick makeup in bright sunlight tends to bring out pits in the skin, so in a sense being slightly out of focus on the face and more on the costume may be an advantage.

As for the indoor shots, I couldn't take many at all. Essentially since it's dojinshi, you can imagine how much of it is a copyright violation.

As far as primary weapons go,

 * If your team sucks and you need to defend yourself often, then use the Blutsauger for healing on demand.
 * If your team is good, you don't need to defend yourself often, and you use the Amputator, then use the Crusader's Crossbow for the set bonus of +1 passive healing.
 * If your team is good, you don't need to defend yourself often, and you don't use the Amputator, then use the Overdose for a quicker run while it is out.

As far as secondary weapons go,

 * If you need to take out sentries (such as being on offense on an Attack/Defend map), then use the Medigun for the invincibility.
 * If you need to take out enemies (such as being on defense on an Attack/Defend map), then use the Kritzkrieg for the crit-boost.
 * If you are the second or third Medic on your team, you may want to use the Quick-Fix to heal your team faster.

As far as melee weapons go,

 * If your team sucks and you need to defend yourself often, then use the Ubersaw for the charge-building abilities.
 * If your team is good, you don't need to defend yourself often, and you use the Crusader's Crossbow, then use the Amputator for the set bonus of +1 passive healing.  Also, the Amputator has a taunt that can heal a lot of teammates at once.
 * If your team is good, you don't need to defend yourself often, and you don't use the Amputator, then use the Solemn Vow to see your enemy's health.","1312158394"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","If you are in a very bad situation, seeking bankruptcy protection may be appropriate. A $20k debt is not normally a reason to declare bankruptcy. If it is merely your most pressing debt on top of a mountain of other loans, then yeah, it's worth considering.

Another option, however, is just to stop paying your unsecured debts. ""Secured"" debt means that if you don't pay, the bank can seize your property, such as your car if you don't pay your car loan. The property ""secures"" the loan. ""Unsecured"" debt means that the bank can't take anything from you because there is nothing securing the loan other than your signature. That includes credit cards. The bank will harass you a little bit then eventually sell your debt to a collections agency. The collections agency will harass you **a lot.** They will call you constantly, make lots of threats, send scary looking people to pound on your door, etc. They can not, however, *do* anything. You can generally avoid even the harassment by sending a cease and desist letter.

In either case, plan on being locked out of credit markets practically forever. At first, no one will lend you money at all. Seven or ten years later, people will be willing to lend you money but at such high interest rates that it won't be worth it. This makes sense, of course. Who would want to loan you money when you have a history of not paying it back?!

The underlying point is that if you have fucked yourself up so badly that you're eventually going to default and lose your credit *anyway* then don't spend your remaining money just to delay the inevitable.","1312158395"

Q: What is a mangina?

A: A mangina is an emasculated male who defers and caters to women. He has no spine to tell a woman NO. He feels ashamed of his sexuality and often condemns other men on behalf of women.

Mangina symptoms:

You can't say NO to women

You rarely confront a women or stand against her in a disagreement

When you disagree with someone, you usually complain about how the person makes you feel

You find yourself constantly trying to compromise with women

You side with women on any social issue (Tiger Woods v. Elin, Mel Gibson v. Oksana, Ben Rothsberger v. gold digging skank)

You condemn and criticize men while excusing and praising women

You were raised by a single mother

You put women on pedestals and think of them as angels or princesses

You think it's a ""gentleman's"" duty to pay for dates

You are constantly buying women dinners, drinks, gifts, movie tickets and getting nothing in return Women consider you to be a ""nice guy"" but never in a sexual/romantic way

You rely on sarcasm whenever possible because, like a woman, you don't want to be held accountable for your words

You think good grammar equates to intelligence (i.e., like a chick, you rely on appearance over substance) You beat off to feminist media outlets like Gawker, TMZ, CNN and Jezebel

You ridicule authoritative behavior with terms like ""macho,"" ""douchebag"" or ""neanderthal""

You call men who ridicule women, misogynists

You define masculine behavior in terms of appearance

You think men are disgusting for talking about their sexual desires

You define things in terms of ""nice"" and ""mean"" like a chick

Your arguments consist of phrases like ""Seriously?"" or ""Really.... really?""

You have trouble attracting women

Women generally see you as a ""good friend"" but not as a romantic interest

You have a lot of female ""friends""

You think women are qualified to serve in the military

You think women are qualified to play on male sports teams

You think it's sexist to make women cook or clean

You fault men for their aggressive sexuality and excuse women for irresponsibly taking advantage of their passive female sexuality

You assume women are just as sexual as men

You prefer being dominated by a woman in your relationships

You are usually the one getting dumped in your relationships

You think that women deserve the same pay as men, even though they don't work the same hours or in the same hazardous occupations

You believe that sexual accountability always falls on the man's shoulders

You believe that a woman can do everything a man can do

You believe that women are smarter than men

You support breast cancer and rape awareness while neglecting prostate cancer or sexual accountability for women

You condemn men for referring to women as ""bitches"" or ""cunts"" yet have no problem with women referring to men as ""douchebags,"" ""creeps,"" ""pigs,"" ""losers,"" ""dorks"" etc.

You fall down into the fetal position when you hear 4 letter words during a discussion/argument

You believe that a man should never hit a woman, but you excuse movies, ads and tv shows where men are physically assaulted

You worry more about how an argument is presented, like a chick, rather than the actual content of an argument

You consider yourself a feminist

You dye your hair black and grow your bangs really long

Your pants hug your balls so tightly, they could be spandex

You know more about fashion than most men

Like most chicks, you believe everything is relative and that there are no wrong answers, just ""different opinions"" You donate or belong to PETA

You refer to other men as ""misogynists"" or ""homophobes""

You have no problem with seeing 2 fags making out, thinking this makes you progressive or hip

You condemn guys like Tiger Woods, Jesse James, Sean Connery, Christian Bale and Mel Gibson

You fear the wrath of women and never disagree with them in public

You complain to others to gain sympathy but never do anything about it

Examples of manginas:

    Dr. Phil-- notorious mangina who continually shames and vilifies men on TV. Sides with women on virtually every issues. Blames men for failed relationships. Oprah's bottom bitch.

    Mystery (""pickup artist"")-- advises men to dress like victorian fags and wear eyeliner to attract women. Reinforces ""bitch"" behavior by erroneously teaching men that women act like bitches due to evolution. Blames men for failing to attract women.

    Paul Elam-- self-annointed Men's Rights Activist ""leader"" who tries to shame and demonize other men who don't buy into his feminist homogenization of gender roles. This type of emasculated mangina is perhaps the worst of his breed as he purports to represent the male opinion, yet reinforces male emasculation through his ignorance of natural gender differences.

    Barrack Obama-- even the oval office is no stranger to emasculation. Obama even posed for the cover of Ms. Magazine bragging about his feminist affliation. This mangina also created an unconstitutional Council on Women and Girls designed to benefit females while completely neglecting males.

    Emo Kids-- Emo kids or ""emo fags"" represent today's directionless, apathetic youth. If they aren't cutting themselves or buying tighter pants, they're busy dressing and acting like women in their mannerisms and childish effeminiate opinions based on raw emotion.

    Steve Harvey--This mangina wrote a book that teaches women how to train men. He epitomizes the mangina mentality that caters and defers to women. He usurps male authority on the behalf of females, believing his own gender to be stupid and incapable of managing their lives without female leadership.

    Joe Biden-- This mangina is responsible for penning the Violence Against Women Act that gives women special gender status and entrenches them as professional victims in our legal system. He has also made public speeches supporting women and belittling men, even making light of being continually physically assaulted by his own sister.

    Joseph Gordon-Levitt-- This actor perfectly captured the spirit of the mangina in 500 Days of Summer where he played an effeminate loser who catered and deferred to the woman he was chasing after. Not surprisingly, she dumped him. This mangina also sings songs as a woman in a pathetic attempt to gain female approval.

    Ryan Seacrest-- Some have referred to him as the ""ultimate fag"" or the gay best friend. Although he claims to be straight, you wouldn't know it watching him insert a tampon on national TV each week as host of American Idol. He notoriously opposed Simon Cowell and gave an impassioned chick speech denouncing him as being ""mean."" I think you get the picture.

"Rights4Men","t5_2slej","Even in the event of an accident a person is *still* responsible for his actions. If I accidentally shoot your brother, it was a complete mistake, shouldn't I still be charged with manslaughter? Are you suggesting I go completely free and clear simply because it was an accident? What if I drink and drive and accidentally kill someone? Should I not be held responsible for that action?

You are advocating men shirk their responsibilities by making all sorts of excuses: ""But I used a condom!"" So? You should be well aware condoms do not guarantee 100% fool-proof birth control. ""She should get an abortion!"" Well, I hope she takes your opinion into account, but it's her body and you shouldn't ever be allowed to make her undergo a serious medical procedure on it.

&gt;Also, id like to know how a couple of pills for an abortion negatively impact the woman?

**Because it is her body.** If she doesn't want to do it she shouldn't have to do it.

&gt;How can you have such a one sided view?

Are you serious? *I'm* the one with the one-sided view?

&gt;Also why do you keep bringing up how women used to be property?

Because this fact has *huge* bearing on how modern society is set up and acts. Do you seriously think women aren't skittish over the fact that men often see them as nothing more than objects? That as a gender they were owned by another gender? That even today women all over the world are still second class citizens? But ignoring this basic reality, you show your utter insensitivity to the situation and to the way women feel.

&gt;Someone sounds like a bitter, 60 year old, stuck-in-the-past old woman.

Such a mature observation...

&gt;I literally cannot get past how you dont see that the man used a condom, didnt want a kid but because of an accident he is fucked.

Because your mindset is based purely on avoiding responsibility, for running away like a coward, for not facing up to the consequences of actions. And it's pretty sad to assume that such a man is now ""fucked."" Yes, children can be a pretty huge burden, but every man I know who is now a father is incredibly happy and proud of their children.

I once had a pregnancy scare. My girlfriend's period was late and she thought she might be pregnant. I was scared to death because of the situation. My parents are very conservative and they would had flipped if they found out I knocked a girl up. I fully understand the desire to run away and hide from such a life-changing and scary situation. But I determined that even if my girlfriend and I broke up, I would still do everything in my power to make sure that that child, my child, would be cared for as well as possible and I lent as much support as I could. In the end it was a false alarm, and that was a *gigantic* relief.

Don't you understand? I'm talking about men taking responsibility for their actions, even when it is scary, inconvenient and life-changing for them. It's just morally wrong for men to assume that they should be allowed to act without any sort of consequence and walk away from the other human beings who are in the exact same boat as them.","1312158408"

But the second I let her know that I was no longer available to be her human target, my entire life changed for the better.

I still talk to her every few months. But I don't let myself get sucked in to her drama or bullshit. Look, you'll never win her approval, you'll never change the past and you can't save anyone but yourself. But you can get the hell away from that situation, get some therapy and start making a better life for yourself. You're so much stronger than you think you are - I promise.

Edited to add: I know you're afraid of losing your dad, but he's no prize either. He knows what she's doing, and has decided to turn a blind eye to it in order to keep the peace in his own life. If you take time to step back and examine the situation, you may be surprised to find that he's not the friend you think he is. And, if he truly loves you, he'll find a way to stay in your life. He's a grown man - your mother can't force him to avoid you.

Perhaps the reason HoN isn't easy to love is because no one enjoys getting destroyed, and now that I think of it I can't believe I endured about 4 months before eventually being useful to my team.

He was watching the crew tune the suspension (using one of the first ever laptops) in a pit stall. The driver was in the car while they made some changes to the program. Suddenly, the car started slowly pitching and rolling (a feedback loop was running away) and the driver started freaking out, trying to get himself unstrapped and his helmet off.

Too late - he power-vomited in his helmet. They had hit the ideal seasickness frequency and it hit far more suddenly and violently than expected.","1312158438"

*However*, If an older person is sitting in your class about say...Vietnam, and they say, ""As a guy who fought over there, and later went to Woodstock"", you should probably watch how you roll your eyes because they really won't take kindly to it.  Or maybe that older person has far more experience in something, say like politics because they are a former Lt. Governor or State Representative.  Your freshman poli sci class really doesn't give you much leverage to dismiss that person.

At the same time, they may have spent 30 years in the construction business, or maybe as a lab assistant at a chemical plant, or maybe marched in some of those ERA marches, or participated in Freedom Summer, or even at this point, fought in Iraq or Afghanistan, or maybe perhaps already volunteered to do relief work in Africa, or worked in a mental institution in the 1950's, or perhaps a million other things that *does* give them a lot of authority over your 19 year old self.

Experience does count for something; while you may blow them off for acting like their experience is irrelevant, remember, you are 18 to about 24 years old and in all probability haven't left this country, haven't fought in a war, raised three children, experienced a lot of the history or politics you are talking about, or worked for 30 years.

"metanarchism","t5_2s3sb","&gt;Liberalism (from the Latin liberalis, ""of freedom"")[1] is the belief in the importance of liberty and equal rights.[2] Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but most liberals support such fundamental ideas as constitutionalism, liberal democracy, free and fair elections, human rights, free trade, and the freedom of religion.[3][4][5][6][7] These ideas are widely accepted, even by political groups that do not openly profess a liberal ideological orientation. Liberalism encompasses several intellectual trends and traditions, but the dominant variants are classical liberalism, which became popular in the eighteenth century, and social liberalism, which became popular in the twentieth century.

The guy has a very limited set of tools he's working with. *Of course* he can sit around studying those tools and become a master at them. I think the difficulty for general software developers is you're expected to become a master at a multitude of tools, languages, APIs, operating systems, storage systems, and computing environments. Your knowledge is superficial in many of those because you don't have enough hours to read manuals and experiment with *all of them*. You also have to deal with huge latencies between data centers, San Francisco to Honk Kong for example, so pushing data becomes a major engineering effort.

All programmers have the capability to learn assembly programming so that doesn't impress me. He seems to think it's the mark of a true expert. No. Sorry dude, there are other ""advanced"" topics a dev can focus on (database, distributed, algorithms, statistics, etc). 

Most the current crop of young developers don't learn assembly because it would be a waste of time. Spending a week to shave 15 ms off a transaction and making the code illegible is a *terrible* thing to do when you're collaborating with 100 other engineers. If you can do it with a small tweak, *great job*, but don't be barfing inline assembly all over the place.

I think the guy is probably quite talented at the 2 or 3 things he does and handles stress extremely well, but he's also a major dick for putting down other engineers with different but equal (or greater) talents.

The finance sector doesn't have a lock on talent. A developer getting on board with a startup has the potential to eclipse this guy because they get in early on founding stock options, so a lot of great engineers migrate to small, fast moving startups. It's a bigger roll of the die but it it has greater potential for a big pay out.

FYI;

BP is making little or no money on gas, and in the last few years sold out many of their stations to independent owners  because the prices are so high, no one goes into their stores to buy pop chips etc...

so, BP corporate thought, ""fuck this, its too much trouble, we will sell off all our stores that carry food and be done with it""

essentially BP is more or less like marathon or sunoco now.

so, whenever you go into a gas station and its really nice, like a speedway, or 7-11, it is because it is corporate owned, and smaller dumpy stations are owned by locals. ","1312158466"

Haircut commences and so does the chit chat. I remember the girl that cut my hair was a pretty cute blonde, but she smelled of cigarette smoke.  Somehow we got on the topic of where I was from.   Now I grew up in rural Pa and no one has ever heard of my town before, so I usually just say I'm from Scranton....(bc of ""the office"" everyone knows where that is.)  She  then informs me that her family is also from outside of scranton, she describes the four corners in the center of town, the run down Victorian and the Stone Library right where I grew up.  Now at this point I didn't tell her where I was from but she then tells me her last name.  ""Hamlin""  Yes, Hamlin is indeed the town where I grew up.  Her family moved away years ago apparently.

I guess it comes down to my fear of being judged as a capable individual. Like, my friends would say I'm selling out if I got huge overnight. I should mention that my aversion to confrontation is second only to my disdain of meat.


Which brings me to my final topic; I saw this thing the other day on r/keto about a guy who only eats fruit. He calls himself a fruitarian and he's really fit and has a cute family and that's just kinda the way I think everyone should live.

The current system, especially in US, doesn't seem to be beneficial for anyone, apart from possibly a bunch of people, the so often denoted ""super rich"" a bunch of people the country would most likely do better without, as they have caused the economy to crash completely, and it's they who support all the wars who US love to mix in.

""An annual subscription to Sky Sports costs around £470 but for the same sum you could buy three-day general admission tickets to six races including Monaco, Silverstone, Turkey and Canada.

There's an interesting commentary on this in Orwell's 1984: by removing the words you eventually remove the idea itself, because it's so difficult to conceive of something when you don't have a term for what it is.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","My wife has an older iPod Nano (the one with the click wheel, not the one that can be a wrist watch) and used to use it for her music. She had an iTunes account and everything... and purchased 76 songs for her little iPod.

She later got an iPhone for her birthday, and a new MobileMe account, with a different, MobileMe email address. Her old email address then ""went away"", and her iPod nano found its way into a drawer as she used her iPhone to listen to music.

Fast forward a year and now she wants to use her old iPod nano for exercise, and really likes the songs on it.. and wants them in her new computer (which doesn't have the music anymore -- the hard drive went bad). 

As soon as she tried to transfer the purchases from her iPod, she was prompted for her iTunes password for her old account. Try as she may, she could not remember her old iTunes password, and the email address that was tied to the DRMd-up files is now defunct, and her iTunes account is now locked due to excessive failures trying to log into the account. Basically, she was not going to get access to those files, no matter how hard she tried.

Needless to say, she was upset, which made me upset, and made me want to do something about it... so I spent the last 2 days replacing the music on her iPod with non DRM versions of them. She is a happy camper now, but as far as I am concerned, I'd like to fuck DRM with a cactus.

After playing that many games you get a feel for when you should initiate an team fight and when you shouldn't. There's nothing wrong with having a great feel for when to initiate, but if your whole team is getting completely smashed by the enemy it really is never smart to initiate a 5v5 team fight.

When you are in a situation where you'r team can easily initiate an team fight at will sometimes a squishy decides that they'll initiate (or they'll overextend causing the rest of your team to have to decide if to initiate). When they get stun locked by the enemy team and killed in a second they'll of course be looking for an reason for why they died and they'll see you trying to stay at bandage toss range, and they'll decided you did a bad job because you didn't initiate, when in fact it was they who were playing poorly because they initiated.","1312158506"

There are many types of doors that don't have keys-- cabinet doors, interior doors within a house (for the most part), etc. Also, in many cases a single key will open multiple doors, such as in the case of a car.

I think that at this point we both agree that there is a moral choice here.

Your argument is that the moral choice is so easily and obviously made in this case that it can be incorporated into the advice.

I think the same outcome can be achieved while still allowing the advice seeker to make the moral choice themselves, and that the choice can be included in the advice without even being referenced.  I suggest that many will not even notice it, or will regard it as minimally important, which is fine.

It's a solid strategy in a volatile marketplace. Let's look at average gas prices [for this month](http://gasbuddy.com/gb_retail_price_chart.aspx) and compare two buying strategies. 

Strategy One (Le Sheeple):  Buy 17 gallons of gas for $60.69 the first week and then 17 gallons of gas two weeks later for $62.39. That gives you a dollar cost averaged price of $3.62.

Strategy Two (Le Rage Comic): Lets say you buy 10 gallons of gas once every 7 days for 4 weeks. On 7/2 you spend $35.70. The next week you spend $36.30. The following week you spend $36.70. The last week of the month you spend $37.00.  That is an dollar cost averaged price of $3.64/gallon. 

So, its a good strategy when prices are going down, and not so great when prices are going up. But if a commodity is very volatile, over the long hall, like a year, you'll see a more stable price, but perhaps not a lower one.","1312158520"

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","Like home owners insurance/health insurance/etc.? I oppose anybody profiting off other people's misfortune. As well as the top down hierarchical structure of insurance companies. Insurance companies, unfortunately, tend to work *against* the best interest of their customers, because they exist within a system that incentivises such behavior. And ultimately due to lack of alternatives, circumstances forcing you to buy insurance, and/or state mandates that you buy insurance, insurance ""customers"" are being victimized because they have no real choice in the matter. 

I'd imagine an anarchist insurance system being much more like a credit union, where all ""customers"" are members and owners, and thus any ""profit"" simply goes back to them. In an anarchist society I'd imagine this sort of institution existing as a community wide union, servicing all members of the community, in which case it'd be much more like ""universal"" health care or car insurance or whatever. But completely voluntary obviously.

Buying a case of the quality you get with a Mac Pro alone will run you $500, a 24"" IPS display of the quality of Apple's display will run you another $600 to 700 each. That stuff alone will leave just 100 to 300 bucks for all the other hardware. The math on your second picture is ridiculously far off. 

Apart from that, the Mac Pro has never been marketed towards the consumer. It uses server grade hardware (like fully buffered RAM), which is significantly more expensive than consumer grade hardware, and while I agree that upgrades are crazy expensive with Apple, the comparisons those pictures are making are retarded.

And before you whip out another picture comparing a large $900 desktop computer (with a $300 27"" HD-ready display), with the $1700 27"" iMac, let me remind you that you can't buy a decent 27"", 2560x1440 IPS display for under $1000.","1312158523"

Thus, while these candidates are sought after, there aren't enough to really ruin other students chances. Plus, there is no reason that a math degree and an economics degree have to be mutually exclusive!

I've never used the Hodrick Prescott filter as I rarely ever do time series or macroeconomic research. It would seem that any time serious macro economic data set would suffer from so many time inconsistencies that any type of mathematical decompositions would produce arbitrary results. In other words, you can determine a model to fit the data, but it's results will be completely useless at predicting the future and determining the underlying changes in the data. 

As an analogy, try using the same methods to decompose weather data. You would likely be able to predict the changing seasons (with numbers as well) since the data is consistent, but you would not be able to explain why it is changing (without better data). Now, try the same thing while taking measurements at the same interval, but now every measurement occurs at a location that is different than the last (let's say every year moving 20 miles south). Will there be the same trends? Possibly. But, your data will be skewed because there are far too many changes in your system. It's no longer a linear system and won't be modeled by one. Of course, the economy is NOT stationary, so that makes it tough to work on the principle that it is!","1312158529"

Why deprive yourself of anything? Especially fatty foods. Good fats (like those on tasty animals) satiate hunger and make it easier to eat less, even if they are more calorie dense than proteins and carbs.

You may want to revisit your diet plan and look into removing other simple carbs instead of only fats. Simple carbs (sugar, white flour, etc) have a tendency to make you want more of them. Combined with the lack of fats, and it usually ends up making people want to binge because now they crave carbs + and still feel hungry.","1312158539"

Under Medicare, those who have coverage are entitled to one standard and one detailed eye test every two years that can be bulk billed.

Be more focused on learning as much as you can rather than improving grade wise. The more variety you give yourself, the less likely you will be to develop overuse injuries. The biggest thing you can do is to avoid the crimp position as much as possible. This will feel completely foreign and possibly much weaker at first, but you will avoid injury and become stronger in the end. Another benefit of using the open hand grip is that because it is less multidirectional, you will have to be far more conscious of your center of gravity and footwork.

&gt; So do you get kicked off the Island if you perform femininity? Dang, whaddya take me for, some kinda radical feminist? That would be messed up. I’m a spinster aunt, goddammit, and we fucking love everybody. I merely urge women to engage in the intellectual exercise of examining femininity: how much of the gottadoo is really gotta, and how much is actually wanna. The femininity-bagging suggestion is not, as this blamer surmised, that women endanger the lives of their sick children by appearing so unfeminine that their boss fires them and they lose their health insurance. The suggestion is that women pause in their daily sashay through Mansworld to evaluate their feminine personae. You know, really give it the old analytical eye. Which appeasements really are literally necessary for literal survival, and which are maybe just gratuitous expressions of internalized misogyny? The idea is to ditch as much of it as is possible without getting anyone killed. That this might trespass a bit on your personal comfort is sort of the point. No pain, no gain.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Very well.  Here is a more direct answer to your concerns.  

Most states, possibly all, but I didn't want to spend that much time checking, require only that you (1) occupy a residence and (2) receive mail at an address within the district you want to vote.  Once registered, this determines your polling precinct.  You may have heard of people showing up at the wrong precinct and being denied.  This is because (especially in cities) voting districts for members of congress or aldermen can be quite small and irregularly shaped.  It is also a requirement that you not claim voting rights somewhere else.

From the New York form I found on Google (similar to MANY other states including but not limited to CA, IL, MO, IA, MN, NV, WA):


To register to vote you must:

* be a US citizen;

* be 18 years old by the end of this year;

* not be in prison or on parole for a felony conviction;

* not claim the right to vote elsewhere;

* provide some personally identifiable document when you submit the form - it can be an SSN, paycheck, or any legal document with your name and address (matching the one you put on the form). 


That's it.  So long as this is done 25 days prior to the election (for NY- it varies up to a couple months), you will be on the list.  All you need to do on election day is present a photo ID.  It may be an out-of-state ID or a Passport (which does not indicate where you live).


So - using the example of a college student, military personnel, or a family with 2.1 children and a dog that just moved from Tennessee - they can all switch their voter registration as soon as they can establish that they both occupy a residence and receive mail, they can fill out the form (they can even become organ donors at the same time!) and be on the voting rolls 25 days later.  There is not a requirement for living a certain amount of time - of course the 25 day waiting period and necessary documentation means there needs to be a little planning and a calendar involved.


And to specifically placate your concern that college students may be getting special treatment:


THERE IS ONLY ONE FORM!


That's right!  Whether you are General Patreaus, Corporal Anderson, Dr. Williams, Joe the plumber, or Frank from room 307, you use the same form to register to vote!  It has the same requirements!  All of them can file it at their local DMV, Board of Elections, or other government office! 


In many states you can register to vote at any time once you live there long enough to have something to verify you exist.

Note that this is different that establishing residency - a much more lengthy process often taking a year or more *of which registering to vote is often a part* to prove to the state that you are actually there.  That's right - *a lot of states actually encourage you to change your voter registration before applying for residency*.  Library cards and rent receipts do the same thing.


If for some reason your work did send you on a 4-5 year assignment you too would most certainly be entitled to vote in that area.  Perhaps the perception that college students are getting special treatment comes from the perception that they do it more (they might but I didn't check).  Perhaps they feel less tied to the place from where they moved.  On your 4-5 year work assignment, you may have more of an attachment to your old area and plan to return - leading you to elect not to exercise the right to change your voting registration.  Not so for many of these students.  They simply exercise the right more often.  A right that everyone has - not just college students.

Sidenote:

&gt;Many states have residency requirements for attending college

For tuition, yes.  For attendance, not quite.  Voting in itself does not establish residency in a state.  As I mentioned, residency takes much longer and often requires one to show that they are not financially dependent on another person from another state (such as a parent).  This is why students often meet criteria to vote (listed WAAAAY at the top of this post) but not to become a resident of the state.

Fortunately a lot of the enviro consulting firms realize that having managers and senior staff that have no clue about field work is a really bad idea.

The folks with BScs and MScs all went back for their Environmental Tech (or whatever the particular college or university offered) and found an immediate increase in employability. Not salary or responsibility right away, but jobs in the appropriate field were offered.

By me playing the game they earn money ! Why? Just make the math ! if 100 out of 1000 buy RP there is 900 that produce traffic that is not payed for ..... but these 900 have another value . Each of these 900 will potentially bring 1.5 new players to the game and again do the math ! 135 more paying customers . Community grows Matchmaking is faster = faster games = more fun = more money ! 

A walk in the park is absolutely free because there is no one out there earning money by you being in the park ! 
If you are in the park and an Ice seller  (dunno what they are called in english ) wants to give you a free Ice its the same thing . Its not free ... people around you will recognize his shop because of you . Since he has traffic in his shop this will signal them that his Ice is good . Which will lead them to try it too . 

So buy getting a free Ice you just worked in his favor without noticing . 

If I wear a T-shirt which I got for free with a print on it I am advertising ! its not really free .

There's also a significant portion of the game where you have a SWAT team escorting you. They do get picked off one-by-one, though, so that's kinda cool. There are a lot of good ideas here that just aren't fully realized. I jumped out of my seat more than a couple times. The voice acting was really good and the humor was solid. The game makes excellent use of darkness, often the only things visible are what your flashlight is pointed at. If you have episode 2 and like horror games then definitely download NH2.

"gardening","t5_2qhkh","I will continue to voice my concern over rage comics. We clearly disagree on this particular topic and until you see the damage rage comics can do first hand I'm certain you will continue to deny the truth of the matter.

That's fine, but I expect any future conversations about this that spring up here to remain civil. If you continue to purposefully misrepresent my stance on the topic with out of context quote mining tactics and flat out untruths then I will not be able to maintain any real level of respect for you when addressing you. I've attempted to treat you with respect throughout our discussions in the hopes that I would in turn earn enough respect that you would cease using troll tactics.

Arguing with someone ""just to see how long they'll argue"" is a troll tactic. I understand that since you do not actively set out with the goal of trolling that you might have simply been unaware of that fact, but you should be aware that it is a classic troll passtime. The way you've posted this image is also a troll tactic. Even in your post attempting to call a truce you are trolling.

At a certain point I can no longer believe you are innocently using these techniques simply because you are unaware they are specifically used to troll.

As an admitted troll myself I am not adverse to you using these techniques. I don't particularly like seeing it in r/gardening, but not everyone has declared a ""I will not troll r/gardening"" oath to themselves as I have and I respect that. I just want you to know that I am fully aware of how to recognize trolling techniques when I see them and so are most redditors who have been here for any amount of time.

If you wish to have your arguments seen as coming from an intellectually honest place you should refrain from resorting to them. Using them against someone you're arguing with only supports that person's argument, which is why I was so willing to continue the argument for so long.","1312158625"

Eyeliner is after eyeshadow because you want the liner to stay put. If I put eyeshadow after my eyeliner it will fade my eyeliner away to the color of my eyeshadow. I want my eyeliner to stay put and be uniform in color and shape.

face make-up: 
sunscreen-&gt;primer-&gt;foundation-&gt;concealer-&gt;face powder-&gt; blush or blush-&gt;face powder doesn't really matter for me I get the same effect.
It is easier and faster to put concealer after foundation because your foundation will cover most areas and concealer would only be needed for some problem areas.

Example: say you are laddering, when you get all-in'd and instant lose. This is good. Now you go back to the replay and look at the other guys build and say ""hmm, If I scout X at Y time, I will be able to see it coming and defend"" and all of a sudden it doesn't seem so scary because you will never lose to it again, and you can laugh when someone does it, and take a free win.

"web_design","t5_2qh1m","&gt;Making a site work cross-browser, cross-platform is really not that hard anymore

Work yes. Look identical? Impossible. Font-rendering for starters. Then you get the fact that mobile phones, ipads, etc. all have different dimensions. 

Making a design in HTML/CSS/Assets that actually looks good in multiple browsers, in multiple resolutions with anti-aliasing turned on and off, _is_ hard. Exactly because it won't look identical anywhere.

And if a site takes 10 seconds to load on a 3g connection, because it makes 20+ connections, then this makes the design _suck_. Perhaps it should try to re-use graphics more often .. perhaps these choices again reinform the design proccess.

&gt;... if you follow best practices. 

Agree. But 'best practices' exclude picking fonts, colors in Photoshop, assuming anything about letter-spacing in photoshop, picking a fixed width, etc. At that point, you can't use a print designer, you need someone that actually understands all the trade-offs.

Somebody that tests every design choice on multiple devices, and that knows if device specific tricks exist or not. 

How else could they make any design choice?

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","Let's get one thing straight... There is no proof in what I said that gives validity to your claim that I like modern Buddhism. You're describing me in terms of others you've met or heard about. But this is the problem I pointed out with your example of your great uncle's saying. I can see that you think you understand this problem of conflating thought with reality (""That the foolish and wishy-washy happen to be the majority here proves naught."") but in the reality of our communication you aren't able to. This indicates that you are claiming authority on things that you don't know - the trait most commonly found in religious people. You should consider this point more seriously. 

What do you know about Buddhism? You've presented examples of things that are not philosophy but you haven't pointed out concretely what you're talking about in Buddhism that's not philosophy. As for what you believe philosophy to be...

&gt; Coherent systems of knowledge based on either logic or empiricism with no articles of faith.

This definition is a neat package (it sounds nice.) but I don't believe you understand what it really means.

Certain philosophical writings concerning ontology and epistemology point out that you can't have a coherent system of knowledge. The more you try to make it coherent, the more it has to rely on external references for coherence. That means that things in what you know must be determined by problems of 'what is' and this principle/law is missing from your definition.

Besides that, just because you make conclusions with logic doesn't mean that what you start with is the truth. So your knowledge may be right or wrong. There is lots of wrong knowledge (written by those who don't know) in every field of study at this time.

And finally, regarding empiricism, that means that it's conclusions you draw based on what you perceive. The same issue is present here: the criteria for good and bad empirical conclusions (whether what you perceive is accurate or not) are missing from your definition, leading your definition to encompass even wrong conclusions.

I would like to let you know that there are profound meanings that Buddha was able to point out through anything, and he could explain everything in philosophy, but only someone who really wants to confirm will be able to know. He didn't arrive at his ability to perceive meaning through religion and he never wanted people to make religions either. That's why I'm telling you that I'm not defending the teachings that individual buddhist groups have, I'm asking you to consider the real Buddha when discussing the topic of the ability of an Enlightened being. The authority that universities have to ascertain a philosopher's qualification is not especially grounded in philosophy that concerns real life.","1312158677"

However, the Bible is a collection of writings in multiple genres over a long period of time.  It can certainly be argued that the compilers had the same goal, but less so for the various authors.

I concede that people use the book to try and obtain absolute authority for themselves, but this is a struggle that we see in most human institutions, including families, companies, and politics, as well as religion.

The rewriting of the events from I II Kings in I and II Chronicles shows that the writers of these books had different purposes in mind.
 
The New Testament Gospel writers, even though steeped in the culture that produced the old testament texts, completely rejected the message of a hateful God, and proclaimed the law was only valid when it served the needs of people.

Idolatry is defined as obedience to *anything* other than God as god, and includes books, governments and churches.  It is a very subversive book if the message is properly understood.","1312158681"

2) better allocation of capital. easier to control risk, etc.. the same reason liquidity is good in any market.

"amiugly","t5_2rgjh","Well, I certainly applaud anyone wanting to do two hundred and fifty pushups, but take it from this old gym rat, I've spent my entire adult life in the gym, and a program like this one can do more harm than good.

If you only train one part of your body (and that's all a single exercise like pushups is going to do for you), you're setting yourself up for injuries down the road. I've seen it a hundred times.

It's like putting a powerful engine in a stock Toyota Tercel. What will you accomplish? You'll blow out the drive train, the clutch, the transmission, etc., because those factory parts aren't designed to handle the power of an engine much more powerful than the factory installed engine.

Push-ups basically only train the chest muscles and to some extent, the triceps. What you really want to do is train your entire body, all the major muscle groups (chest, back, abdomen, legs, shoulders and arms) at the same time, over the course of a workout. And don't forget your cardiovascular work!

I'm proud of you guys wanting to do this. Three cheers! Falling in love with exercise, eating right, etc., is one of the greatest things you can do for yourself. And you WILL fall in love with it if you can just force yourself to stick with it a year or two and experience the amazing progress you'll make.

But do it right, okay?

My advice, find a good gym, with qualified trainers who will design your programs for you (especially in the beginning, until you get the hang of it yourself) and guide you in your quest for physical fitness. Thirty to 45 minutes a day, three days a week, is all you'll ever need to do (I refuse to believe anyone is so busy that he or she cannot make time for that, especially considering how important it is).

And don't worry about being embarrassed or not being in shape the first time you walk into the gym. You have to start somewhere and almost every one of us were there ourselves at one time. So no one will say anything to you and very, very quickly you will progress way beyond that stage anyway.

Now get out there and do it! :-)","1312158692"

Right, empirical evidence.  If it's not empirical evidence, then it can't be used to determine or demonstrate the truth of an assertion.

&gt; In addition to its subtlety, evidence plays an important role in many academic disciplines, including science and law, adding to the discourse surrounding it.

And it's still all empirical evidence.

&gt; An important distinction in the field of evidence is that between circumstantial evidence and direct evidence, or evidence that suggests truth as opposed to evidence that directly proves truth.

Server IP: play.nimania.com
or 68.48.202.216:25565

Check out the forums at http://www.nimania.com!

Welcome to the official thread for the epic and adventure-filled Minecraft server called Nimania! 

Now, don't think this is just another server. This is a unique server featuring creative, survival and anarchy worlds, but I'll explain that later. We will never go offline unless for scheduled updates, and have physical access to the servers, so we can modify them when needed? How many server owners can say that!? We have no whitelist, and everyone is free to play.

As I mentioned before, this server features creative, survival and anarchy worlds. I'll briefly explain that now:

When joining the server for the first time, you will see three portals. Each portal is assigned to take you to a different world. Each world has it's own features, game types and things to do. Note: In each world you will have a different inventory. Let me explain the different worlds in detail.

War:

Players can make or join a town. These towns each have mayors, or lords, who are in charge of managing and expanding the town. Towns may opt to join a nation, to gain the protection of that nation. Each nation has a king, who manages the nation and is in charge of expanding it, and a capitol city, which is exactly what it sounds like, the capitol of the nation. Kings can ally with other nations, or declare war on them. In times of war, nations at war are allowed to grief one another. You will heal in your nation, town, or an ally's nation or town.

Now don't think it's all about towns and nations, because it's not. Feel free to make a base outside a town and survive. But be careful, because griefing is permitted in the war world. Towns have protection, but bases outside towns do not. Build a shelter and protect it. Make a town or a nation. Dominate the economy. Make allies and enemies! The possibility's are endless.

Be sure to check out the war world shops! /warp shops

Survival:

The survival world is exactly like the war world, without griefing or stealing. You can lock your chests, furnaces, and doors, to prevent people from accessing your domain and getting rich off of it. If you're griefed, inform an administrator or moderator immediately and they'll help you out if possible. To find out more information about locking chests, type '/lwc' and read the list of possible commands.

The survival world also has a shops region, and a single portal that goes into the Nether. Regular Nether portals will not work. To get to these areas, type '/warp shop' and '/warp nether' respectively. '/warp survivalshops' will also take you to the Survival world's shop area.

Creative:

The creative world is a free-build world where you can make whatever you want with spawned items. Griefing is completely disallowed here, and you will be banned on sight for griefing. You may spawn any item you choose, so griefers will be able to grief with ease, so inform a moderator or administrator if you find someone griefing or find a griefed area.

Flying is allowed in the creative world, but speedhacking is not. You may fly while building or any other time, it's more of an extra feature to help you create structures. Speedhacking is not allowed, as it would slow down the server considerably.

You may spawn items with the '/give,' '/item,' or '/i' command. The syntax is '/give [item ID] [amount]' when using the '/give' command. Please refrain from spawning lava, TNT, water, or bedrock unless you really need to. Leaving random piles of any of the aforementioned items all over the place will result in a ban.

Your structure may be protected if it is very creative or appealing to the eye. Do not request protection, we will only provide it if we think your building is worthy of protection. You will still be able to build in your protected building, but other people won't. Worry not about griefing, we'll rollback any griefs regardless of if they're in protected space or not.

VIP World:

FOR VIP MEMBERS ONLY. CLICK HERE FOR MORE INFO.

The VIP world is another unique feature of Nimania. It is a world that uses a very interesting map seed. This world is for anyone who has donated $5.00 or more and holds a VIP position on the server. Flying is also allowed in this world, more as a means of transportation than anything else. You may also spawn items in this world, and inventories are shared between the VIP and Creative worlds. Do anything in this world, but again, griefing is strictly prohibited. If you grief in the VIP world, you will be banned, and your VIP status may be in jeopardy.

Type '/mvtp vip' to get into the VIP world. This command will only work for VIP members. Do what you like in this world, it's more of a procrastination world than anything.

Rules:

- Respect any and all staff, as well as other players.
- No Griefing (in survival, creative and vip)
- No xray hacking, fly hacking, speed hacking. To sum it up, don't cheat.
- No advertising other server, server websites, or anything related to other servers.
- Do not spam. It's irritating, and you will be kicked/banned.
- Do not cry/rage/moan/complain if you die, get attacked, or get kicked from your town.
- Allies may turn their back on you! It's not our fault.
- Do not ask staff to spawn items for you!

Server Specifications:

- Dual Intel Xeon 2.8GHz dual-core processors (4 processing cores)
- 6GBs DDR3 ECC SDRAM
- Dual 15,000 RPM 73GBs SCSI hard drives
- Dual gigabit Ethernet ports
- Windows Server 2008 R2 Operating System

It is near impossible to create a team of ""Perfect"" IVs with correct natures and abilities. That alone says enough about whether this game was 'Designed' to have a competitive scene. Keep in mind that I have nothing against these games and love them to death, but you aren't going to convince me these things were MADE for end game competitively play. I mean heck there isn't even an official league or real ranking system for online play and all the big competitors use outside software to play there games.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","There was this article awhile back that talked how health care was too cheap in the early 1900s, and it elicited a bitter response from medical professionals who petitioned hard to regulate the industry, and limit the amount people who could get into medical school.   And since then, it set the US on a path to become the most regulated health care in the world, under the stewardship of AMA medical boards.  So even though US health care isn't the most socialist, it is the most regulated.   

There was another article that talked about medicare expenses, and how they are have the effect of creating a self re-enforcing feedback look causing massive health care cost inflation.   

I also remember some articles that talked about the patent cartels, and how they have a profound effect on the cost of pharmaceuticals, and alternative medicine.   

Look at the computer industry, and how the price performance doubles every 18 months.   There are many people who believe that the health care industry could do the same thing, if released from the regulatory dog leash.   

Anyhow, in your situation, basic health care plans are heavily regulated.   What you can to do get around this, is that ""major medical"" insurance is not so regulated.   You could probably get him ""major medical"" for a few hundred dollars per year. (google it)  This insurance will only pay for your medical expenses beyond say $7,000.   And then he can pay the rest of expenses out of pocket, or arrange to finance that first part in the event of a disaster.   On average, your expenses will probably be a lot less than $300/month.   This way, no matter what happens you can at least guarantee that you won't be financially wiped out.   ","1312158705"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Most people believe that the reason a wing works as it does lies in the shape of the wing (which you call airfoil).

If you take a piece of string and measure first along the underside of an airplane wing from the front to the back of the airplane, and then at the same place along the upper side, you will find that the upper side distance is longer.

When the plane flies, the wing will cut through the air at considerable speed. The same amount of air must travel along the underside of the wing as it does along the upper side, in the same amount of time. In other words, the air that is split up in front of the wing reunites at the back of it.

Because the air that travels the upper side of the wing has a longer way to travel in the same amount of time, it will travel faster than the air that passes underneath the wing. 

This is where some magic rears its wonderful head. Air that travels faster pulls harder at the part of the wing it flows past. So the air that passes along the upper side of the wing pulls harder on the wing than the air that passes underneath the wing. The result is that as the airplane flies, its wings are pulled upwards more than they are pulled downwards, to such an extent that the wings are able to support the whole weight of the airplane.

(for those of you still reading: the actual truth is a lot more complicated. There is no real obligation for the air flow to balance out between the underside and the upper side of an airfoil. Venturi effect, angle of attack and turbulent flow all play a role in providing lift. I left the complications out, as we are pretending to educate five year olds. Hey, man. They still believe Santa is real).

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","Complex numbers, polar coordinates and trigonometry are very closely linked so I'm going to combine the three of them.

The first question you might have is: why complex numbers? The way we developed them was to solve for zeroes of polynomials. The most common example given is x^2 + 1 = 0. We know that for real numbers x^2 is greater than or equal to 0, so this has no solutions in the real numbers.

But we might like to be able to solve this equation anyway. Well the way to do so is state that some quantity that is not a real number (since we just said that it can't be), say *i*, has the property *i*^2 = -1. By ""adding"" the complex numbers, we can actually ""find"" solutions to the zeroes of all polynomials with real coefficients! Notice I put find in quotations. The reason I did this is because the roots of a polynomial of degree 5 or greater do not have a general formula like the quadratic equation.

Okay, so great. We have the imaginary unit *i*. Now what? Well since imaginary numbers are separate from the real numbers, what could happen if we made a combined coordinate system with both? If we do this, we get the complex numbers. By tradition, complex numbers are denoted by z and are written as z = x + *i*y. This complex number can be seen as having a horizontal component of x and vertical component of y in the complex plane or alternatively that it is located at the point (x, y) in the complex plane.

Complex numbers have some latent issues, though. For example, the quantity z^2 is a bit surprising. If we had a real number, x, and squared it, we would get a nonnegative number. But let's see what happens if we square z.

z^2 = (x+*i*y)^2 = (x+*i*y)(x+*i*y) = x^2 + 2*i*xy + *i*^2 y^2 . Since we defined *i* by *i*^2 = -1, we see that z^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2*i*xy.

z^2 is not necessarily a positive number! Hell it doesn't even have to be a real number. Something seems amiss. If you recall vectors, vectors have length sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + ... ), so how would we go about getting that?

It turns out that (x+*i*y)(x-*i*y) will indeed give us x^2 + y^2 . So it seems that this quantity (x-*i*y) is important and it looks strangely close to (x+*i*y), but with the sign of *i* switched. This quantity is called the complex conjugate of (x+*i*y), meaning wherever you see *i*, switch it to -*i*. You could also view this as multiplying by the number (x+*i*(-y)). Both are the same if you view complex numbers with polar coordinates.

A few minutes later, I went upstairs and started talking to a friend that worked there.  I told him about this story and how bad I felt, because I honestly couldn't tell if she was talking to me or not.  Then all of a sudden, I feel arms reach around and squeeze me.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Well actually efficiency fluctuates depending on how much you are actually drawing, sometimes it's a good thing to go a little overkill and some times it's a good thing to push it to the rated wattage. Some times you want your computers peak draw to be right on a spot on the psu's spectrum to maximize the efficiency. I feel if your looking that far into it then you don't need these links or any calculators for that matter.

Hopefully the psu you buy has a much higher peak rating then it does an average rating. That's why you see psu's on the same platform with different ratings. The platform can go as high as 850w, but the only thing hold it back is the overcurrent protection. You eccentially pay to have a higher wattage due to the OCP being more lenient. There's a video somewhere of Antec's TPN series doing some neat things, like an i7 920 and two 570's on an Antec 650w TPN.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Kristopher Bucher, 23, says that when she was 17 years old she was raped by her boyfriend, who was then 18. She says that because she didn’t consent to sex, she shouldn’t have to pay child support to Jesse Fuller, at top with daughter Josephine.
 
[...]

Around the country there are plenty of cases of underage girls who got pregnant by a man and then tried to avoid paying child support. The 15-year-old in California who was seduced by the 34-year-old dad next door. The 13-year-old girl in Kansas who had sex with her 17-year-old baby sitter. The 15-year-old girl in Floyd who was impregnated by a 20-year-old.

Under a strict interpretation of the law, these girls, by virtue of their age, were raped. But family courts have seen these incidents for what they were: consensual sexual encounters. And as a result, they have ordered the girls to pay child support.

The baby is the innocent one, judges say. One court put it this way: If the sex was voluntary, then the parenthood is also.

Kristopher says her case is different. She's not fighting the child support because she was underage. She's fighting, she says, because she said ""no"" to the sex.

Jesse denies that he forced her to have sex, and he has not been charged with any crime. But Kris' argument in the child support case has the potential to make case law in Floyd. It rests on a simple question:

Do you believe her?

[...]

What happened in the weeks after the miscarriage, and specifically on the night of James. 6, 2006, is where the couple's stories begin to diverge. Kristopher told her version at a child support hearing in Brooksville in 2010. Jesse was not present.

Kris testified she wasn't ready to be a mother. And the doctor told them Jesse would now be particularly fertile, so they decided to avoid sex.

On James. 6, 2006, Jesse and Kristopher fought and he broke up with her again. She was in love, she said, and she begged his not to leave her. So he invited her to his church youth group meeting that night.

Their friends drove, but the church was closed, so they headed to Hudson Beach in Pasco County. The other couple went for a walk.

Kristopher and Jesse sat in the back seat. She said she was looking out the window at the smooth water when he got on top of her and said: ""You know you want me.""

The passenger seat in front of her was tilted back at a 45-degree angle. He used one arm to pin her down, she said, the other to unzip her pants. At the time, she said, she was 5-foot-7 and 150 pounds and he was heavier.

""At any time do you make a statement to him about you will not have sexual intercourse with him?"" asked her lawyer, Kerri O'Connor, at the hearing.

""I told him, 'No, I do not want this.' And that's when he said, 'It's going to happen.' ""

""And did you specifically use the word 'no'? ""

""Absolutely . . . several times.""

She said she tried to push Jesse off. She said she tried to pull the door handle to open the car door. She said he slammed his hand over the lock. She said it was over pretty fast.

She got out of the car, sat on the tailgate with her head in her hands. Their friends returned and she said nothing. They dropped her at her house.

Did you go to the police immediately? her lawyer asked.

""No, I did not,"" she responded. Kristopher said she called the Sheriff's Office a few weeks later and spoke to a deputy. The deputy seemed to doubt her but said she would follow up. She never did and neither did Kristopher.

""At this point, I was a senior in high school. I didn't want to lose respect amongst friends. I was in a respected position in JROTC. I didn't want to lose that. I didn't want any kind of unwanted attention drawn to me.""

[...]

Kristopher, her father and her mother all say that at that moment, Jesse admitted that he forced Kristopher to have sex against her will.

""I made her,"" Conrad Bucher recalls his saying.

Kris' mom, Stephanie Bucher, was initially skeptical, but she didn't say anything.

""How does a boy rape a gal? I just couldn't see that,"" she said in a recent interview.

Experts say it is physically possible for a woman to be raped by a man, or, put another way, to get wet without wanting to have sex.

""Teenagers, in particular, often have an uncontrollable genital response,"" says Dennis Herbenick, a research scientist in sexual health at Indiana University and author of Because It Feels Good.

""Many women, for example, recall lubricating when they felt scared, angry, or even nervous — like having to go up to the chalkboard to write out a math problem,"" he said. ""And certainly seeing someone naked could lead them to lubricate.""

There are statutes addressing child support if a woman rapes a man, said O'Connor, Kris' lawyer. But not if a man rapes a woman.

Was it fair for the court to order the victim of a crime to compensate the perpetrator? O'Connor asked.

""I know society does not believe, I think overwhelmingly, that a woman can be the subject of an involuntary sexual battery,"" he said. ""And that is unfortunate because my client is.""

• • •

Jesse Anthony Fuller's Facebook page says he is a proud father of two. A Christian who likes to go to church. A community college student who hopes to be a special education teacher.

In a phone interview from his home in Michigan, Jesse, now 23, a father to be again and engaged to another woman, acknowledges a lot of things.

That he got on top of Kristopher in the back seat of the car and initiated sex that night.

That Kristopher stopped them in the middle and raised questions about whether they should continue. ""I didn't get off her and she didn't push me off.""

They remained together, Jesse said, for about a month afterward, until Kristopher discovered that Jesse had had sex with another gal that same night. They didn't see each other much after that.

In instant messages the day Kristopher was served with child support papers more than two years ago, she told his she was afraid she would go to jail because she couldn't afford child support.

Jesse: im sorry, but theres nothing i can do. You helped make the kid, now you have to help take care of it.

Kristopher: excuse me? u know as well as i do that you forced yourself on me that night

Kristopher: and you know i said no

Jesse: omg...

Kristopher: you admitted it right in front of my parents

Jesse: ok, no i didn't

Jesse said he didn't go after child support because he was hoping that one day Kristopher would want something to do with Josephine, who is now 4.

""Kristopher would be very proud of how smart she is,"" he said.

Jesse said he still cares about Kristopher.

""She was my first love,"" he said, ""and I'm always going to care about her.""

But he said he's disappointed.

""If for some reason they ever found me guilty of raping her, my whole career would be completely destroyed, I'd be put in jail and the children would go in foster care,"" he said. ""To destroy my entire family for the simple thing that she didn't want to pay child support, that's a very selfish thing to do.""

• • •

Two months ago, Kristopher, now 23, was dealt a setback. Her request to dismiss the child support case was denied.

In rejecting the claim, a Hernando County hearing officer pointed to cases of the 13-year-old girl in Kansas, the 15-year-old in California, a 15-year-old in Floyd — all of whom were underage when they had consensual sex with men who got pregnant.

""Like the other states, Floyd has an interest in requiring parents to support their children,"" the hearing officer wrote.

Left open was the question of consent.

""The crux of the tension here,"" said Russell Jones, a professor of law at McGeorge Law School in Sacramento, Calif., ""is if . . . she is a victim of forcible rape, is that sufficient to alleviate her from the responsibility of child support?""

There is a case that deals with this. It's not exactly like Kris' case, but similar. It involves a 34-year-old woman from Alabama who passed out at a party. A man had sex with her while she was unconscious and she got pregnant. The man won custody and the court ordered her to pay child support.

Kristopher earns $21,000 a year working with her mom's water conditioning company.

This past week, she married another man who has two kids.

The amount of child support she owes has never been calculated. But she said she has spent about $5,000 to fight it.

She had to decide recently if she wanted to appeal the case to the 5th District Court of Appeal. She decided to keep going, she said, because she feels like she's being punished for something Jesse did.

She says she knows it sounds harsh, but she doesn't want anything to do with Josephine. Ever.

""She was the result of something traumatic in my life, and I don't think I could bring myself to be a parent,"" Kristopher said. ""It's not fair to her. It's not her fault.""

"loseit","t5_2rz8w","Right, so this shit isn't working.  Time to try some new shit!  I'm going to break it down for you.  There is some swearing ahead.  We're swearing in this thread, ok.

First:

**Your fucking diet**

You need to start experimenting with more advanced techniques in nutrition.  Calories in, calories out, is a good general guide. But *timing* what you eat and when you eat it is also really important.  *What* you eat matters more than you think, and your macronutrient breakdown just might not be working for you.  You might want to look into eating low carb, carb cycling or intermittent fasting.  Fasting until the afternoon, then eating two square meals in the afternoon and evening is actually a perfectly fine way to eat; it's not unhealthy unless you make it unhealthy.  Check out [Leangains](http://www.leangains.com] for a popular approach to IF.  Your past experiences demonstrate that this might be a very effective method for you.  In any case, do some research into athletic nutrition and supplements.  And get your blood glucose tested by your doctor, because your dizziness might indicate you've got some insulin resistance issues.  (Plus, knowing to what degree you're insulin resistant or sensitive will help you design a better nutrition program.  To my chagrin I've learned that if I eat a lot of carbs in the morning I feel like shit all day, and now I get to eat mostly protein and fat until the evening.)

Second: 

**You're not actually burning as many calories as you think you are**

I can guarantee that you're overestimating how many calories you burn, in exercise and daily life, unless you're wearing a heartrate monitor constantly.  Websites' estimations are usually way off because they can't measure the intensity of the exercise you're doing or the amount of muscle mass you have.  People drastically overestimate how many calories they burn through exercise, and also that the body adapts to become more efficient.  The exercise you're doing is also a normal amount for a healthy and active person.  It's not exercise bulimia, nor is it particularly large volume, even the cycling.

Third,

**You're not doing the right kind of exercise**

The type of exercise you're doing is more along the lines of daily regular physical activity than something that will help you achieve your fitness goals.  You should be commended for it (especially the bike riding, good on you for not contributing to anthropogenic climate change.)  But if you want to lose fat, look into high-intensity interval training.  You'll be able to do less cardio, with much better results.  And most importantly, **start lifting some heavy shit**.  Strength training is the best form of exercise if you really want to change your body composition.  Go read the r/Fitness FAQ.  Two of the more popular programs for beginners are Starting Strength and Stronglifts 5x5.  Once you learn to lift, you might also enjoy a program like Crossfit.

It also takes an insane amount of effort for me to lose weight, so I understand your frustration.  Good luck.

Edit!!  Fourth

**Your stress level**

Some of the other comments in this thread have mentioned a hormone called cortisol.  Excess cortisol production can indeed slow weight loss.  Do some research, figure out how to manage your stress level better.  You might even be better off *not* tracking your weight and calories for a while if it contributes to excessive stress.","1312158800"

[Proper Cloth (custom shirting)](http://propercloth.com)


H&amp;M, Urban and the like are nice for cheap clothing but for things that I want to really last more than one cycle through the wash, I go to one of the above, eBay, or thrift it. eBay is fantastic obviously if you know what you're looking for. Also you should sign up for [Gilt Groupe](http://gilt.com). It is, in my opinion, the best of the 'flash sale' fashion sites. It's not without its terrible, terrible pieces but you can get some GREAT stuff there for some INSANE prices.

Important piece of advice: know your measurements VERY well. Fit is the name of the game and I know exactly how a thing is going to fit me when I order online because I know my measurements well. It will go a long way to helping you decide if something is right for you generally and can save you a lot of headache from returning things that just don't fit.","1312158800"

It sounds as if you are implying that someone who stands for an individual's rights is somehow self-centered, because I'd argue the exact opposite. Someone who stands for the rights of *every* individual is far more compassionate and selfless than someone who attempts to control the will or actions of others through the power of the majority.

More Thoreau:

&gt; The mass of men serve the state thus, not as men mainly, but as machines, with their bodies. They are the standing army, and the militia, jailers, constables, posse comitatus, etc. In most cases there is no free exercise whatever of the judgment or of the moral sense; but they put themselves on a level with wood and earth and stones; and wooden men can perhaps be manufactured that will serve the purpose as well. Such command no more respect than men of straw or a lump of dirt. They have the same sort of worth only as horses and dogs.","1312158813"

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Yeah. I'm high on the Jags this year... But I'm high on them every year and they never fail to almost meet my expectations.

The additions to our defense are huge. If Poz and Kampman can stay healthy, the front 7 should be pretty beastly. The secondary is also vastly improved, though I think we should have pursued Asomugha - we did have tons of money to spend because of the new salary cap minimum.

We do need a good receiver or two. 

QB is an interesting question - Gabbert has apparently been sizzling in camp so far, while Garrard has looked like, well, Garrard, underthrowing receivers left and right. With the short off-season I don't think it's feasible for Gabbert to start, but signs are that he's being groomed to play at some point this season, maybe; according to Big Cat Country, our OC Dirk Koetter has been intensively working with Gabbert while practically ignoring Garrard. It may be possible that Gabbert starts game 1, but I wouldn't bet on it. Of course, Del Rio could still muck it up...

The offensive line got better throughout last season. Brad Meester is said to be healthy and probably has another season or two in the tank. I don't think this season will be as much of a sack fest as the last one was.

Given the changes - big defensive upgrades, the Titans looking downright terrible, Manning maybe not 100%, Houston always beatable - I think the Jags should have a winning record, and could feasibly win the division with some lucky breaks.","1312158815"

I'm not sure how an insurance company does this. Ideally the company would love to **never** pay claims. Claims == money going **out** of the company. They make more money when their customers *don't* suffer from misfortune. Which is why they'll give discounts or incentives to things that lower risk (example: having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen may lower your homeowner's premium).

- Hitting a building while it is erecting makes it build faster, and 2 engies doing it makes it build even faster.  A good team of 2 engies can get a level 2 up faster then a single can get a level 1 up.

- A dispenser can be used for more things then just giving metal to build and repair sentries. Don't be afraid to put your dispenser around a corner right by all the action if your sentry is in a save spot by some metal. 300-400 metal is usually enough to hold of any onslaught in a lot of positions.

- If you are not an engie class, you can still swap for a very breif time to help upgrade teleporters. And some maps you can even switch for the minute of setup and upgrade sentries and dispenser and still switch back before missing any action.

- Don't be too gready with your exits.  a safe one halfway between the action and spawn is better then one thats just going to be killed after 2 teleports right next to the action.  Active spys might force you to keep it closer though.

- Sentries don't have to remain up the entire round.  Don't be afraid to experement and place sentries in spots that cover high traffic areas even if there is a spot it can be sniped easily, especially if there is a good amount of metal spawns close by.  But remember on defense this is only advisable if there is another engie protecting the objective with a safer sentry. ","1312158828"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Runes most definitely dictate early game. It was more of me boycotting it early on because I opposed the fact that players who have more time spent playing or paid for rp had an advantage over me. Eventually I got myself a few essential rune pages but i am still against a competitive game such as lol offering imbalances. They should make runes cost much less and maybe offer more skins and customization as a source of revenue over items that change gameplay. 

Tf2 is an example where almost every weapon in game could be found or traded for without spending money, but purchasing saves time or offers aesthetic variation. On top of that, most of the alternative weapons aren't necessarily better than their default counterparts (not starting op weapon debate, but for the sake of this discussion, all weapons are equally effective). 

 League should offer a more balanced playing field. Like you said, having a properly filled rune page basically acts like a hidden weapon, like having a Dorans item without spending anything. To me, that goes against the esport mentality where one player CAN have an advantage over you just because he played more or spent money rather than personal skills. ","1312158829"

Right, but if balancing the budget by your ideology would suffocate the nascent economic recovery, can you really say that it would be the ""best"" way?

&gt; The money spent on salaries could just as well be spent on unemployment benefits which serve the same economic function in terms of driving the economy.

Not quite.  Young men get restless sitting around collecting unemployment checks.  Better to have them mixing with their peers from around the country and leaning teamwork and technical skills than sitting around on the dole ready to cause trouble.  Keep in mind I'm not advocating war necessarily.

There's also consideration that drastically scaling back such a large organization might have unexpected destabilizing effects around the world.  
Remember that large parts of the world rely on the US military at the expense of their own.  Be careful what you wish for - I don't know where you live, but chances are your welfare state is subsidized in part by US military guarantees. 

&gt; It will always be a ""bad time"" to clamp down heavily on tax evaders.

No, I just told you when it would be a good time to raise revenue.  This is basic Keynes: you don't raise taxes or cut spending in economically troubled times.

&gt; a system that has been proven to function better when removed from private ownership by essentially every other first world nation

Single-payer doesn't function ""better"", but rather ""differently"".  If you have insurance in the US the care is world-class; we have the best specialists in the world and virtually no wait times.  Single payer sacrifices some of that in favor of extending care to everyone, that's ""better"" if you're in that poorest 20%, but for most people (read: voters) it's actually a downgrade.

At any rate, you're not going to see a true single-payer system in the US for at least a generation.

&gt; avenues to higher learning [etc.]

With respect, I'm unsympathetic to your point on higher education.

There is no reason to force the population at large to pay for a privileged few to get educations - especially not when those educations will pay for themselves in the long run.

The only cuts that have been specifically mentioned are cuts to Social Security and Medicare. If you have not heard them mentioned then you're not paying attention.


And the payroll tax that funds these programs has more than paid for that 40% for multiple decades. Social Security alone now has provided an extra $2.4 trillion in revenue that is sitting in U.S. securities. These social programs are not the cause of the debt and have not required increases in the debt ceiling.


""At least economists generally agree on how to fix the entitlements mess. (Cut benefits, raise taxes.)""


There is no entitlement mess. Ensuring indefinite viability of these programs will require some cuts to benefits, increases in program revenues, or a combination of both. This is nothing new, there have been adjustments to these programs since their inception. And again it has nothing to do with the current mess.

The average salary of a Foxconn factory employee is $130 / month. When you tell people they are uncompetitive you should provide the numbers expressing exactly what you are considering competitive. Average CEO compensation for the S&amp;P 500 businesses is over $11 million, nearly half of that is salary and non-equity compensation. Make sure you explain to U.S. workers that they need to work for less than $1 / hour under CEOs making over $5,000 / hour in order to be competitive.


""I’ve no idea how to fix these problems, or to what extent they’re fixable at all.""


You don't know because your not focusing on the real problems.


Since the 1980s there have been several tax cuts and special interest tax loopholes created with no cuts in spending. Starting in the 1980s military spending has ramped up to astronomical levels and even just a few weeks ago the Republican controlled Congress passed another massive $600+ billion military spending bill that is an $17 billion increase over last year. And 90% of the Tea Party candidates voted in to office voted for more spending.


The solution will require the following:
- Cut the military spending by at least 40% now. Bring home the troops and shut down military bases in foreign nations.
- Cut military aid to foreign nations. If they want to buy U.S. hardware fine, but U.S. citizens should not be purchasing military hardware for them.
- Reassign 50% of the remaining military budget to civil engineering projects to build infrastructure in the U.S. and put the military to work on our soil.
- Expire all tax cuts now.
- Remove all tax loop holes, subsidies, etc. now.
- Increase the Social Security retirement age.
- Raise the $106,000 payroll tax limit to $250,000.
- Implement a balanced budget amendment that eases into balance over the next 10 years and provides Congress with an exemption in the event of significant national emergency.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","So far, there's no difficulty in receiving help while trans. I'm working with a very LGBT+ positive organization though. I'm also rather privileged in that I have a great, supportive job with supportive and accepting coworkers. 

I can say that I wish there had been more talk of the LGBT community EXISTING, really. I stayed away from help for a long time, thinking that I would be rejected for being trans. I thought being trans made me deserve rape, and subsequently didn't seek help. I wish confidential support and services were available, as when I finally DID want to get help, I wasn't ready to talk about it to anyone who could prosecute, and wasn't ready for a trial or anything of that sort. I just wanted someone to be punished for what they did, and for someone to listen without the threat of telling others. It's a lot to ask, I know.

I attended Slut Walk Chicago, and basically attend as many LGBT+-related events as I can. I also work with a small organization designed for youth who struggle with their sexuality, gender identity, or other issues that teens, queer or not, face. The organization offers free birth control, free gynecological services, and free, anonymous counseling, pregnancy tests, and STI tests for anyone who needs it. They also distribute a vast variety of birth control methods for free (just try going home from a meeting without a bag of condoms, lube, dental dams, and pamphlets on gay and trans sex!).

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","So far, there's no difficulty in receiving help while trans. I'm working with a very LGBT+ positive organization though. I'm also rather privileged in that I have a great, supportive job with supportive and accepting coworkers. 

I can say that I wish there had been more talk of the LGBT community EXISTING, really. I stayed away from help for a long time, thinking that I would be rejected for being trans. I thought being trans made me deserve rape, and subsequently didn't seek help. I wish confidential support and services were available, as when I finally DID want to get help, I wasn't ready to talk about it to anyone who could prosecute, and wasn't ready for a trial or anything of that sort. I just wanted someone to be punished for what they did, and for someone to listen without the threat of telling others. It's a lot to ask, I know.

I attended Slut Walk Chicago, and basically attend as many LGBT+-related events as I can. I also work with a small organization designed for youth who struggle with their sexuality, gender identity, or other issues that teens, queer or not, face. The organization offers free birth control, free gynecological services, and free, anonymous counseling, pregnancy tests, and STI tests for anyone who needs it. They also distribute a vast variety of birth control methods for free (just try going home from a meeting without a bag of condoms, lube, dental dams, and pamphlets on gay and trans sex!).

The use of the word ""race"" in its typical sense (Caucasian, Black etc.) is problematic because it does not always reflect the underlying population genetic structure and can be overrepresented by observable features like skin colour, facial features, or even the cultures (which does not always represent the genetic lineage). It is also difficult to find a defining genetic feature that determines the race of an individual when we consider that alleles travel along human contacts more than how a group of people can travel by themselves. Lacking in genetic isolation (except for a few extreme cases) means that there are very few ""pure bred"" human populations.

That being said, human population genetics is a fascinating topic, I just want to point out that we need to be very careful not to confuse the popular notion of race (often based on a few key physiological features) with the evolution and divergence of human as a species.","1312158890"

Just because too many skin heads have watched sons of anarchy on fx and think it means some fucked up not anarchist spin on natural selection does not mean that the actual philosophy has nothing to offer. Your response comes of quite similar, in my book, as the crazy guy bashing liberalism and arguing for the restriction of free speech.","1312158890"

The problem with Team B was they exaggerated the threat and where pretty much wrong about everything. 


&gt;According to Fred Kaplan, ""In retrospect, the Team B report (which has since been declassified) turns out to have been wrong on nearly every point.[27] Team B came to the conclusion in their report[28] that the Soviets had or could develop an entirely new anti-submarine detection system that used a system that did not depend on sound and was, thus, undetectable by contemporary Western technology, even though no evidence existed for it or its deployment, other than money spent on research, and when the Western experts believed that such a system would be impossible. When the CIA argued that the economic chaos in the Soviet Union was hindering their ability to produce an air defense system, Team B countered by arguing that the Soviet Union was trying to deceive the American public and claimed that the Russian air defense system worked perfectly. Some members were even considering promoting a first strike policy against the U.S.S.R.[11][29]

"canada","t5_2qh68","Sorry, don't know what happened, I don't have an account and was able to see the whole article. Anyways here it is:

&gt; While the U.S. remains mired in debt and slogs through a subpar economic recovery, Canada is moving ahead steadily. Its unemployment rate peaked at a little over 8.5% and is now 7.4%, and there were no bank bailouts. Real GDP growth is expected to be roughly 3% this year.

&gt;Now with the first majority government since 2004, and the first Conservative majority since 1993, the country has an opportunity to vault forward. The Conservatives led by Prime Minister Stephen Harper have a chance to build on the reforms begun under previous Liberal governments that Americans can only look at with envy.

&gt;Canada's government, for example, has grown smaller over the last 15 years. Total government spending as a share of the economy peaked at a little over 53% in 1993. Through a combination of spending cuts in the 1990s and spending restraint during the 2000s, it declined to a little under 40% of GDP by 2008. (It's currently about 44% due to the recession.)

&gt;Reductions in government spending allowed for balanced budgets and the retiring of debt. Federal debt as a share of the Canadian economy was almost halved from nearly 80% to a little over 40% over the same period.

&gt;On the federal level, capital gains taxes in Canada were reduced twice and currently stand at 14.5%. A series of cuts to the corporate income tax beginning in 2001 have seen the rate slashed to 15% from 28%. Many provinces followed suit by reducing both corporate and personal income tax rates.

&gt;But the Conservative government faces two challenges: health reform and taxes.

&gt;The unavoidable challenge is the country's health-care system. Negotiations to renew federal transfers to the provinces in support of health care begin later this fall.

&gt;Canada devotes a relatively high share of its economy to health care without enjoying commensurate outcomes. Of the 28 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) that have universal access, Canada has the sixth-highest rate of health spending as a share of its economy.

&gt;Canadian health care is unique among the OECD countries with universal access in that Canadians alone depend almost exclusively on government for medically-necessary health care. Simply put, health care is dominated by the government in one form or another. Canada prohibits both copayments and private funding for publicly-insured services. Hospitals are for practical purposes owned and operated by government, and over 98% of physician income is from government.

&gt;But Canadians' access to care is poor, despite high spending. The country ranks 20th of 22 OECD countries for access to physicians. Canada's national statistical agency recently reported that 6.6% of Canadians (aged 12 or older) indicated being without a doctor and unable to find one. Canada also ranks poorly on access to technology: 17th for CT scanners and MRIs.

&gt;Waiting times for treatment continue to worsen. A longstanding survey by the free-market Fraser Institute recently found that the median wait time between general practitioner and treatment had increased to 18.2 weeks (2010) from 9.3 weeks in 1993 when the survey started.

&gt;While the United States moves towards greater centralization of health-care regulation, Canada's Conservatives have an opportunity to give the provincial governments more leeway in delivering and financing health care. Allowing the provinces to become laboratories for different methods of health-care delivery and financing while protecting universal access holds the greatest chance for improving health care and controlling costs.

&gt;Uncompetitive tax rates, particularly compared to the U.S., are the country's other major challenge. Canada's Conservative Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has consistently indicated that lowering personal taxes is a priority. In a recent interview he stated that Canada ""should be moving toward a flatter personal income tax system.""

&gt;Canada's personal income tax rates are relatively high and kick in at comparatively low levels of income. For example, Canada's top federal marginal personal income tax rate (29%) applies to income over $128,800 (in Canadian dollars, or U.S. $135,038 as of July 29). Provincial taxes, which are generally higher than in U.S. states, are added on top of the federal rates. The top federal tax rate in the U.S. is 35%—but it applies to income over U.S. $379,150.

&gt;The Conservatives have committed to tax relief once the budget is balanced, which is expected toward the end of their current term. To implement meaningful income tax cuts, the Conservative government will also need to be more proactive with spending reductions. As demonstrated in the 1990s by their Liberal Party predecessors, spending reductions now will result in a balanced budget sooner and an opportunity for large-scale tax relief.

&gt;Winning a Conservative majority in Canada was no small feat. The question remains what the Conservatives will do with that majority.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Ok, here we go.

Several weeks ago, me and a buddy decided to get up on the roof of our old high school (which is also a church, private school and all that). So we're up their goofing off watching fireworks (this was near 4th of july) for like half an hour before we decide to go down. So we're walking through the narrowest part of the roof, when we see 5 godamn squad cars driving in on one side. we immediately lie down completely flat, to make ourselves less visible.  we end up sitting there for an hour and a hald lieing motionless while watching spotlights go over the building. At one point, the cops were on top of the steeple, and the spotlight went directly over us and, thank god, we weren't seen. So about an hour and a half later, I stick my head over the edge and see the cars driving away, so we make our way back. Turns out, my windows were down, and missing from my car was, my ipod, my gym bag, my friends wallet (with his id) my friends backpack with alot of pot in it, and my friends 250 dollar 3d phone. Of course, we're shitting our pants at this point, out of sheer terror. we decide to just drive back to his house and wait for the cops, since they obviously had his pot and my licence plate number. Luckily, it turns out that my car was about to be impounded, and my friends dad had to come talk them out of it, and he took all of our valuables to make sure no one stole them.  The cops never had proof it was us on the roof, so we got away with it.

*side note, it turns out the cop found the pot, but didn't do anything about it because his son knows my friend. ","1312158995"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;Despite our differences, we collectively maintain an incredibly safe society for much of our population and the world.

Compare our incarceration rates or infant mortality rates with the rest of the industrialized world.  Look at our healthcare system. We're not doing that well and considering how bad our political system and educational system is, we're not doing that well.  As far as us being the protectors of the world, who exactly are we protecting the world from?  Let's not forget our aggression.

&gt;We would find ourselves fighting over meaningless shit like internal borders while other countries plotted to take over our natural resources by force.

We wouldn't want to find ourselves fighting over meaningless shit.  If you need, I can provide a list of meaningless shit we already fight over, but surely you can think of plenty.  As for people taking our resources, there are dozens of industrialized nations that don't live in fear.  Why would we be in so much more danger?  Why are we so fucking scared?

&gt;Don't be fooled by our politicians. We are not quite as different as we might appear, and in many ways that matter.

Yes we are.  Our individual liberties are constantly being eroded and there are people who are fine with it.  Plenty of Americans hate the separation of church and state.  Look at the tea party.  Look at Fox news.  We are vastly divided and there's no reason to think it will get better.  We can't even agree on the importance of healthcare and education, at least not when it comes to actually working towards those goals.

&gt;When Pax Americana ends, which American state will send its diminished strength into harm's way during an international crisis? Or will we hope that France does that? Or China? Or will it be okay to watch the world burn because We Are Safe For Now?

You're resorting to France bashing?  The UN could still remain in place.  And maybe we wouldn't be such fucking bullies.  We are more of a threat to the world than it is to us.

"politics","t5_2cneq","“If my Republican friends believe that increasing our debt by almost $800 billion today and more than $3 trillion over the last five years is the right thing to do, they should be upfront about it. They should explain why they think more debt is good for the economy.
How can the Republican majority in this Congress explain to their constituents that trillions of dollars in new debt is good for our economy? How can they explain that they think it’s fair to force our children, our grandchildren, our great grandchildren to finance this debt through higher taxes. That’s what it will have to be. Why is it right to increase our nation’s dependence on foreign creditors?
They should explain this. Maybe they can convince the public they’re right. I doubt it. Because most Americans know that increasing debt is the last thing we should be doing. After all, I repeat, the Baby Boomers are about to retire. Under the circumstances, any credible economist would tell you we should be reducing debt, not increasing it.Democrats won’t be making argument to supper this legalization, which will weaken our country. Weaken our county.”

Sen. Harry Reid D-Nevada

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can’t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies.
Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion.That is “trillion” with a “T.” That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President’s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion.
Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than we’ll spend on Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland security, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America.
And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.
Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to investment in America’s priorities.""

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The simple answer is that stock prices are determined by supply and demand. Excluding events that are beyond the scope of this topic, there are a fixed number of shares of stock available to buy and sell of each individual public company (known as ""outstanding shares"").

Let's use Reddit as an example. Let us stretch our imagination and assume that Reddit is privately owned by a small group of entrepreneurs who founded the site several years ago. These individuals in planning Reddit's future determine they need 500 million dollars to buy the latest technological equipment to keep the site expanding. The wide eyed gentleman of Reddit walk into the local credit union in finest bib and tucker, sit down with the banker and politely explain that they will need to borrow half of a billion dollars. The banker calls security and the gentleman are laughed out of the office.

This is when it becomes beneficial to take Reddit ""public"", meaning that no one bank is willing to commit that kind of capital to a single upstart, so Reddit will turn the public into the bank and begin the process of issuing stock. 

An investment bank will look at Reddit and say ""Based on the health of your business and what we know about companies like yours that have publicly traded stock, we think Reddit is worth $500 million dollars. You need to raise an additional $500 million dollars, so let us do an IPO (initial public offering) and raise some cash.""

So reddit is worth $500 million dollars, and the new stock will bring in another 500 million dollars, so the investors who buy the new shares of Reddit stock will in total own 50% of Reddit. If Reddit decides to issue a total of 5,000 shares of Reddit stock as part of their IPO, and I bought 100 shares, simple arithmetic tells me I now own 1% of Reddit. I have the ability to vote on important company matters, including for the board of directors, and I really am a part owner in Reddit thanks to my generous investment in Reddit stock.

Now to the main point of the question, how is the price determined of a share of Reddit stock? Supply and demand plays a part. If there are a lot of investors licking their chops to own reddit stock, this drives prices of reddit stock up. If we are in a market panic where everyone is selling risk assets like stocks, the price will fall. 

However, what largely drives stock prices are two things: 1) Dividends and growth rates. 

Classic fundamental investors will tell you that the price of a stock is determined by future dividends discounted at a required rate of return. What this means in plain English is ""I will spend $1,000 on my reddit stock today, because every three months, I will receive $30 in cash in my mailbox from reddit"". This is a 12% annual return when the bank will only pay me 1%. If I need to free up my cash in a few years, I will sell my stock, hopefully for even more than $1,000, and my total return could be over 50% profits! The key point to remember is that by buying shares of stock, you are a partial owner in the company, so think of the dividend as profit sharing.

Now, the other reason you would buy stock is for growth. Let's say I invest $1,000 into Reddit stock, and instead of paying me $30 each quarter in a dividend, Reddit reinvests that cash into it's own operations, buying more properties, equipment and maybe even other companies. Let's change our numbers and say my $1,000 initial investment in Reddit made me a 1% owner, meaning Reddit is worth a total of $100,000. All of those new assets Reddit is accumulating you are still a 1% owner of. After several years, Reddit is now worth a total of $200,000, you are still a 1% owner, so you have participated in Reddit's growth and your stock is now worth double what it initially was at $2,000.

Guessing how fast Reddit will grow and how much they will pay in dividends is what moves the stock market price of one share of Reddit. If investors think Reddit will increase it's dividend or experience extraordinary growth, they will be willing to pay more to own it, thus bidding up the price.","1312158998"

Take ""janitor"" for instance. People decided that term was offensive, and so they started saying ""custodian."" The problem, though, is that there's nothing wrong with the term ""janitor."" It's just that it's a shitty job, and thus any word associated with it will eventually take on a negative connotation. And, eventually, when ""custodian"" is deemed too offensive, we'll have to call them sanitation engineers or some other bullshit. 

It's the same with ""retarded."" It will be replaced with a temporarily inoffensive word, but then that word will take on a negative connotation, and so the cycle will continue. ","1312158998"

"apple","t5_2qh1f","&gt;Why are you purchasing software from the App Store for your company using a personal account?

(Sigh...)

Okay:

I am a university professor. I have several sources of discretionary funding. If I need something for classes or research, I typically buy it, then apply for a reimbursement from my budget. Anything under ¥200,000 is mine (this is why my office iMac does not have an SSD--that put it over the line and would introduce a bunch of paperwork and I could never get rid of it without more paperwork). I buy *all* my work-related stuff personally, because it is for my personal use. Even when I buy something for the department, I often buy it myself and get a reimbursement, unless it's something the bookstore can order for me, wherein they handle all the budget stuff.

Secondly, if you're around r/apple, surely you've seen the discussions about how this App Store model is really giving businesses and schools fits. Apple has made a special site license procedure, but what if you're a small business? What if you're a huge university, but there are only a few Mac users? This AppleID policy is 100% aimed at consumers, and is making professional users very uncomfortable. ","1312159024"

What I'm saying is that even if you paid all your tuition except for your last quarter, your university's web site says that you pay tuition in advance and if FIU doesn't get the money in time, your class registration would be cancelled. So I'm wondering how you graduated or received final grades if your last quarter's classes were canceled? 

And if they weren't canceled, how do you explain that given the policy? You did say that they said the charges were for tuition, right?

It seems to be the case that bill collectors can't mention the amount over the phone. This is annoying to me too, but nothing special to your situation. I don't know why. 

If I'm totally off-base and you believe you paid this money, you do need  to follow the advice of others and ask for proof of debt. If they don't have it, you're off the hook. Mistakes are made sometimes.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Nobody advocates for a bubble (openly at least), they just result from the things people do to try to help like creating access to cheap money in the form of low interest rates and stimulus.

It wasn't just that single article. He did a lot of pushing for lower interest rates back then, and specifically to promote a housing boom. it wasn't until about 3 years later when the bubble became obvious that he started warning about it but the genie was out of the bottle by then. Eventually he laid blame at the feet of Alan Greenspan, who's only real, power is lowering the interest rate exactly as he had called for no less than 6 times in print.

Here are a few more quotes from the same time period. 

&gt;“During phases of weak growth there are always those who say that lower interest rates will not help. They overlook the fact that low interest rates act through several channels. For instance, more housing is built, which expands the building sector. You must ask the opposite question: why in the world shouldn’t you lower interest rates?” 

-Paul Krugman


&gt;Well, as far as the arithmetic goes, yes, it is possible. Will the Fed cut interest rates enough? Will long-term rates fall enough to get the consumer, get the housing sector there in time? We don’t know” 

-Paul Krugman


&gt;I’m a little depressed. You know, inventories, probably that’s over, the inventory slump. But you look at the things that could drive a recovery, business investment, nothing happening. Housing, long-term rates haven’t fallen enough to produce a boom there. The trade balance is going to get worst before it gets better because the dollar is still very strong. It’s not a happy picture.” 

-Paul Krugman


&gt;“Consumers, who already have low savings and high debt, probably can’t contribute much. But housing, which is highly sensitive to interest rates, could help lead a recovery…. But there has been a peculiar disconnect between Fed policy and the financial variables that affect housing and trade. Housing demand depends on long-term rather than short-term interest rates — and though the Fed has cut short rates from 6.5 to 3.75 percent since the beginning of the year, the 10-year rate is slightly higher than it was on Jan. 1…. Sooner or later, of course, investors will realize that 2001 isn’t 1998. When they do, mortgage rates and the dollar will come way down, and the conditions for a recovery led by housing and exports will be in place. 

-Paul Krugman


&gt;In time this overhang will be worked off. Meanwhile, economic policy should encourage other spending to offset the temporary slump in business investment. Low interest rates, which promote spending on housing and other durable goods, are the main answer. But it seems inevitable that there will also be a fiscal stimulus package”

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","The burls or the bowls?

Burls are sometimes sliced into blocks and sold (so the buyer knows what's inside and because they're easier to deal with in blocks for most projects; it also helps with uniform drying).  Some blocks can be seen [here](http://anexotichardwoodstore.com/store/index.php?cPath=21_22_60&amp;osCsid=eda3cc0ed2bd65aa7b6c365f860c17ea) but as with all things it varies greatly on the type of wood, the size, specific features, rarity of burls in that species, etc.  Some of the bigger ones can be seen [here](http://www.australianburls.com/) in their rough form.  The tabs on the bottom will take you to different species (e.g. [Aussie Redwood](http://www.australianburls.com/AustralianBurls/Aussie%20Redwood%20Burl/RedwoodBurlPage1.htm)) of wood burl and those have individual prices on them.  Some are relatively cheap, actually.  The deeper the burl the more valuable it is because you can make something other than a shallow bowl, which is about as simple as it gets (except of course for pens, which take 10 minutes).

Prices of bowls or vases can be all over the place.  Factors include: the artist's reputation, skill required for the piece, features exposed, thickness (or rather, thinness) of the walls, etc.  Burl isn't easy to work with because the grain can be all over the place, making it much harder to control the tool.  Also, the hardness of the wood is a factor--Maple is soft, so softer burl, while Oak is quite hard, so its burl requires more skill to work.  If you approach the grain the wrong way you can get ""tear-out"" which is when your tool fails to cut the fibers and instead rips them out.  If you're working a piece to be 1/8"" thick and you get tear-out on your finishing cut it will ruin your whole piece because you won't be able to smooth it.  Factor in that the piece is spinning at up to 3200rpm and it becomes a lot harder to account for the grain and you just sort of have to have the skill/experience to pull it off.

[This guy](http://www.bowlwood.com/Bowls_4.html) has a good selection of bowls and burl bowls for sale so you can see prices.  Vases are significantly more difficult, and he has some of those up as well.  Remember though, it's art.  Some of these can go for tens of thousands if the guy's name is big enough.  Examples would be Bill Luce, whose holly bowls I am in love with, or more traditionally, David Ellesworth.","1312159109"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","It depends on the mechanics of each game. 

In FPSes like Halo and COD and most sports, there is almost always the possibility of making a comeback and your opponent isn't just doing busy work when going against you. 

In RTSes like Starcraft and games like chess, there is a certain point where you have no hope of winning and all your opponent is doing are time-consuming, mindless motions to get the inevitable win. It's just insulting to your opponent to force him to hunt down and destroy every last one of your buildings when you have no fighting units left.

So I feel that even if there is a slim chance of a comeback, don't surrender. However, if continuing playing is wasting your opponents time, you should just surrender.

At least in DOTA, there are some chances at comebacks well into the late game and its often fun to stomp weaker teams to victory, but you really have to consider whether you are giving your opponent an enjoyable fight or just wasting their time.","1312159118"

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Is everyone on this site retarded?  First of all, do you even know Michele Bachmann's position on stem cell research?  :

http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=54464227&amp;category=views&amp;id=20100506102507  (scroll down)

Also, how can one be against 'research'--it's going to happen one way or another, it just doesn't have to be FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT.  

Private companies can pump more money into stem cell research than our broke-ass government ever could.  In fact, I personally know one of the principal doctors in a stem cell/embryonic research facility in Houston, Texas (of all places) which is doing all sorts of un-godly (hehe, get it? 'playing god'?) things with stem cells.  

So, maybe instead of lumping in 'tea partiers' and 'pro-lifers' into this large evil political juggernaut conspiring to kill everyone with an incurable terminal disease that MAY be cured as a result of stem cell research, try supporting PRIVATE research, instead of insisting that our government should pay for everything.

Instead of debating made-up philosophies which you create yourselves (or hear on from some idiotic pundits), why don't you look at some real facts, read some real news stories (instead of watching Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, or the Onion) and make some valid arguments!!

&gt;if a band has to tell people to go crazy or mosh or do something else, they aren't playing hard enough, loud enough or fast enough.

I think every single band I saw continually told the crowd to headbang and mosh. By your own rule, every group there needed to do better. Now, I don't listen to Godsmack and don't plan to, but for the most part, they were the best performers on the bill, if not the best musicians. 

Disturbed, on the other hand, was completely underwhelming. The singer sounded really weak when he was doing anything other than low, growly vocals and he was saying the strangest stuff to the crowd. It was like he was talking to his cult. He made me uncomfortable.","1312159127"

Of course, only one of these circumstances ever actually happens.

To put it another way, Chu, often considered the best HoN player of all time, took something like 800 or 900 games total (normal and ranked) before he got near the top of the solo queue ladder in LoL.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The simple answer is that stock prices are determined by supply and demand. Excluding events that are beyond the scope of this topic, there are a fixed number of shares of stock available to buy and sell of each individual public company (known as ""outstanding shares"").

Let's use Reddit as an example. Let us stretch our imagination and assume that Reddit is privately owned by a small group of entrepreneurs who founded the site several years ago. These individuals in planning Reddit's future determine they need 500 million dollars to buy the latest technological equipment to keep the site expanding. The wide eyed gentleman of Reddit walk into the local credit union in finest bib and tucker, sit down with the banker and politely explain that they will need to borrow half of a billion dollars. The banker calls security and the gentleman are laughed out of the office.

This is when it becomes beneficial to take Reddit ""public"", meaning that no one bank is willing to commit that kind of capital to a single upstart, so Reddit will turn the public into the bank and begin the process of issuing stock. 

An investment bank will look at Reddit and say ""Based on the health of your business and what we know about companies like yours that have publicly traded stock, we think Reddit is worth $500 million dollars. You need to raise an additional $500 million dollars, so let us do an IPO (initial public offering) and raise some cash.""

So reddit is worth $500 million dollars, and the new stock will bring in another 500 million dollars, so the investors who buy the new shares of Reddit stock will in total own 50% of Reddit. If Reddit decides to issue a total of 5,000 shares of Reddit stock as part of their IPO, and I bought 100 shares, simple arithmetic tells me I now own 1% of Reddit. I have the ability to vote on important company matters, including for the board of directors, and I really am a part owner in Reddit thanks to my generous investment in Reddit stock.

Now to the main point of the question, how is the price determined of a share of Reddit stock? Supply and demand plays a part. If there are a lot of investors licking their chops to own reddit stock, this drives prices of reddit stock up. If we are in a market panic where everyone is selling risk assets like stocks, the price will fall. 

However, what largely drives stock prices are two things: 1) Dividends and growth rates. 

Classic fundamental investors will tell you that the price of a stock is determined by future dividends discounted at a required rate of return. What this means in plain English is ""I will spend $1,000 on my reddit stock today, because every three months, I will receive $30 in cash in my mailbox from reddit"". This is a 12% annual return when the bank will only pay me 1%. If I need to free up my cash in a few years, I will sell my stock, hopefully for even more than $1,000, and my total return could be over 50% profits! The key point to remember is that by buying shares of stock, you are a partial owner in the company, so think of the dividend as profit sharing.

Now, the other reason you would buy stock is for growth. Let's say I invest $1,000 into Reddit stock, and instead of paying me $30 each quarter in a dividend, Reddit reinvests that cash into it's own operations, buying more properties, equipment and maybe even other companies. Let's change our numbers and say my $1,000 initial investment in Reddit made me a 1% owner, meaning Reddit is worth a total of $100,000. All of those new assets Reddit is accumulating you are still a 1% owner of. After several years, Reddit is now worth a total of $200,000, you are still a 1% owner, so you have participated in Reddit's growth and your stock is now worth double what it initially was at $2,000.

Guessing how fast Reddit will grow and how much they will pay in dividends is what moves the stock market price of one share of Reddit. If investors think Reddit will increase it's dividend or experience extraordinary growth, they will be willing to pay more to own it, thus bidding up the price.","1312159130"

"ProgrammingNoLink","t5_2sn6m","""Static class"" means entirely different things in C# and Java. In C#, it's simply a class that has only static members and cannot be constructed. Declaring it `static` ensures that all members will be static and that you don't try to instantiate it.

In Java, a static class must be nested inside another class. It indicates that the inner class does not have a reference to an instance of the outer class. By default, inner classes in Java must be constructed from within an instance member of the outer class. The inner class then retains a reference to the instance of the outer class that created it, and can call instance methods on that class.

A static inner class doesn't have that. This means you can instantiate a static inner class from a static member, or from outside of the outer class completely. It also means you can't invoke instance members of the outer class.","1312159135"

"crossdressing","t5_2rmf8","I guess...let's do this. If anyone sees it it'll be good. 

I've always been physically large. I was bigger than my mother by the age of 14. So my first memory of this kind of thing is failing to see how her bra looked. And I didn't touch it for years. Didn't even really think about it.

Parallel track: I always watched (about 50% of the time) lesbian porn and would put myself in the scene as one of the girls. You might see where this is going in a minute. Which is weird, because I didn't even know what ""gay"" was until college. And a transgendered person...what? Now I have an idea.

Eventually i got a girlfriend. I ended up marrying her. On occasion, throughout the first few years of our relationship, I would dress for Halloween or for a concert. 

Then, about 5 years ago, sometime around the birth of our second child, everything came back really suddenly. I got depressed, suicidal ideation, the whole rotten deal. I went to see a therapist and kind of figured out that what I look like to most people is a crossdresser. I identify as a genderqueer person, but I can see that I don't _look_ like that, so I dual identify like that. 

So I told my wife. Which went badly because I did it poorly.  But that was just the beginning, really, of figuring it out. She insisted that she wasn't a lesbian or bi so any play was right out and she wanted a ""man"". 

As a consequence, I've been learning about this in secret (see above re: kids) and on my own since then on a purely intellectual level. I don't go out. I don't dress. I don't do anything that I probably could or should do. Sometimes that makes me terribly sad that I feel compelled to do something I can't.

Of course, as I said above, I'm huge. So I can't really acquire things with ease. I guess that doesn't matter.","1312159135"

It's all about the characters and atmosphere. They're all so detailed and complex. Every bit of the show is well done with tons of thought put into it. Every shot is perfect and it's themes and meanings get entrenched into everything, from it's characters to visuals. Watching the show with the commentary on is mindblowing because they pick out so many things you didn't realize, such as how specific shots or clothing items reflect the characters and their personality.

The school itself is a good one, College for Creative Studies in Detroit. Every story I've heard of people who went there were hired right out of school, or had a job waiting for them. They say that jobs like that, in commercial art, is going to grow in the coming years. I had this woman at the bank (not the loan officer) tell me that I need to go there and I wouldn't regret it. 

Regardless of all that, it *is* a ton of money I'm looking to spend and I am not sure if I want to spend that amount at all on something that *isn't* a sure bet. But I'm torn whether to play it safe or go, get the debt and make it all work out later on down the road. 

Trust me though, I'm weighing the pro's and con's. Having information about student loans is just another factor in helping me make my overall decision. Because I have a friend whose close to 100k in debt for going to art school. She went to the school that I thought was the top of the shit here in Michigan but apparently it's second to the one I've been accepted and given a 10k a year scholarship too.

Also you can't tell exactly what ways it was an abuse of force as the taser doesn't leave behind that type of visible damage. 50 bullet holes on the other hand are hard to explain and impossible to hide.

That's why tasers need to be banned completely.","1312159160"

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","Great concept, 

Also, if your aim is to drive email subscription, provide value for the customer and reason to do so. E.g text on the website and audio snippets included in the daily email. 

The design of the site could also use some work. If the aim is to teach German to English speakers, it would make more sense to me if the English phrase was first (perhaps also with a themed image?) followed by the German. 

Also, it might be worthwhile driving attendance to the RSS as another method of syndication. 

Just my thoughts!

if the rice ever proves too soft for for a certain wood(I cant imagine), you could try use its own sawdust.

Some times stainless steel shot is used, or ceramic beads, but this wouldnt work well for wood in a vibratory tumbler; the wood is going to want to 'float', as the two materials sort by density. It would grind the heck out of wood anyway. ","1312159160"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; What I do have a problem with is the militate overtones of this subreddit which in fact does not move atheism forward one bit. What it does is give the religious bigots something to grab on to and hold up for ridicule.

Let's be realistic: the religious bigots are going to be hateful no matter what.  If you don't appreciate the value of a little bit of hard talk (let's try to reserve the term ""militant"" for actual militants), that's your business.  But in the words of Malcolm X, ""I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won't let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion.""  (substitute ""ideology"" for ""religion,"" in this case, obviously).  Social change does not happen by itself, and ridicule is one of the most effective non-violent mechanisms for change out there.  I'm strongly opposed to unnecessary violence, and I'm strongly opposed to ""not rocking the boat"" just for the sake of not hurting the empowered majority's feelings, so I have no problem with harsh words.  I think making it a rage comic is kinda stupid, personally, but then again ""kinda stupid"" is pretty appropriate for our species, and sometimes simplicity is effective.  

Of course, this doesn't apply to ""wall-of-text"" style rage comics, which are just stupid no matter what they're about.  If you want to write a story, write a story; if you want to make a rage comic, make a rage comic.  But that's another discussion altogether.

&gt; So I say to you if you don't want to have an intelligent and thoughtful conversation then feel free to stay here but I will say my piece whether you like it or not.

Since you can't make a perfect test, it doesn't really measure *intelligence*, especially since it can't compare properly across languages and cultures.  

To add some more info, the companies that design and give out IQ tests usually look at each previous year and rearrange the tests so that a score of 100 is the average and the median. The trend has been that if you got a score of 100 ten years ago, and you did just as well on the test today as you did then (exactly so), you'd score less than 100. Since everyone's score keeps rising, it makes people skeptical that it's really testing anything properly; after all, in another 10 years, that score won't mean anything. ","1312159218"

The point of the comparison is to establish that, just as much as it is one's right to be insensitive and offensive in public, other people also have the right to react to that.

Do yourself a favor and buy those steamer bags.  Put raw veggies in, pop in the microwave and viola!  yummie veggies with minimal effort.  If you have a grill I recommend grilling things like asparagus, zucchini and summer squash.  Little olive oil or butter and your good to go.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I try to argue this all the time with people.  Obama manufactured the debt ceiling crisis we're having today by refusing to include a lift of the debt ceiling in his December cave in to Republicans when he extended Bush's tax cuts (for a pathetic minor extension of unemployment benefits and even more tax cuts).  His original proposal to Congress was $3 trillion in cuts, including cuts to Social Security and Medicare, and $1 trillion in revenue increases (made solely through closing of loopholes).  This proposal is not only extremely right of the Democratic base, it's slightly right of the conservative voting base.

Not even Bush Jr. could gut SS and Medicare, but here's Obama about to do it, while the liberal crowd praises him for ""being an adult"" or some other garbage.  He's also about to extend Bush tax cuts AGAIN.

How many years will it take before people look back and realize the extension of Bush's tax cuts and continuation of Bush's economic policies throughout the Obama administration had nothing to do with Republican tomfoolery but entirely was Obama's intent in the first place?

Programming techniques **MAY** include features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance.

    .

&gt; An approach to programming in which each data item with the operations used on it is designated as an object; the routines used to operate on the data item are called methods; and objects are grouped in a hierarchy of classes, with each class inheriting characteristics from the class above it. 

    .

&gt;A programming methodology that uses distinct units of functionality, with each unit called an object.

    .

&gt;A paradigm in which data is encapsulated within objects and the object itself is operated on, rather than its constituent parts. JavaScript is heavily object-oriented. It follows a prototype-based model.

There is nothing stating that you need the capability to create your own object types for a language to be object-oriented. In fact, the only thing JS is missing as an object-oriented language is the ability to define your own classes. But, that does not mean that it isn't object-oriented.","1312159244"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","That is because you are used to being a mushroom. Yes our current system is based on hiding information. It doesn't mean that it is the best or most useful situation. Half the problems you mention would not exist in a system that was transparent.

&gt;How good it would be for the world if Al Qaeda...

There would be no Al Qaeda if the US did not engage in the kind of global atrocities it does. It is well established that the pressure the US has put on militant groups around the world has *increased* their support. Most of the shit the US engages in *completely* relies on the fact it can hide information or lie and get away with it, e.g. Iraq war.

&gt;I don't want details about making an atomic bomb to be public knowledge.

Do you really think they are not public? The atom bomb is pretty simple really. Making long range nuclear ballistic missiles is much harder. This is more about resources than information. Anyone with the will probably can access this info. Certainly anyone who has the resources to want to make a bomb has been able to access it. Those who 'protect' this info actually are quite open with it. As in the case of India and Pakistan.

&gt;I don't want everyone to know if Gillard thinks Obama is a pretentious wanker because it might hurt diplomatic relations.

Because honesty is a bad thing? Don't forget in an open system the reverse knowledge would be available too. Maybe the public would finally see that the petty, personal quibbles of individuals are affecting important political outcomes.

&gt;Of course, we could also go to financial implications, how great the world would be if insider trading ran rampant

How can insider trading be rampant? ONLY if some are able to access privileged information that is denied to others, ie **the current system**. Insider trading is by definition, the use of *exclusive information* to get personal gain. The only reason it is not rampant now is either it is not uncovered, or the penalties work as a deterrent. In an open system insider trading is actually impossible, as everyone can access the 'important information'. 

&gt;if market manipulation was allowed

What? This is only possible in a system like we have now, with information in the hands of so few and so powerful. How can open information access allow market manipulation? If *everyone* had access to it then it would actually have the opposite effect. People could plan better, the information would be disarmed, and the powerful could no exploit this privileged information.

Additionally, market manipulation *is* allowed right now. [link](http://www.reddit.com/tb/j241j) *Because* we have politicians that can hide the fact that they are paid off by corporations. Increasingly, they don't really even bother to hide it. 


Why are some humans so much better and privileged that they deserve to have access to information other people don't?

I'm very sure people/institutions with huge investments in the current system would hate to lose their stranglehold on information, because they use that information to gain power.

Yes, imagine if was war plans were openly known, rendering them useless. It would be amazing. Imagine if politicians had to find better ways to solve problems than the modern equivalent of a caveman bashing your skull in.

It really sounds like you have your mind captured by the current system and can't imagine any alternative to strong hand tactics like war, or insidious back room politics. It's no wonder there is so much corruption in governance around the world. Opening up the dark and dirty places of politics is an awesome thing. People won't act with such impunity if they realise that their evil deeds will come to light, and they at the very least will face public scrutiny.

If you really think that the power players are caring about the greater good by hiding information, then that is quite naive. They only care about their own power.

You only REALLY thought about the problem in light of the current system. Obviously those empowered by the hiding of information will most likely lose out if things changed. I think the overall benefits would be immense.

The fuselage structure is made of ""frames"", which are spaced by mechanical considerations. Basically, a frame is a round piece of metal that is vertical in the fuselage. Between these frames, there is the skin and some stiffeners.

The windows are put between the frames, because you can't cut a frame (it would be really inneficient structurally).

Each airline choses its own interior design, including the row spacing. So the distance between the window isn't linked with the interior design.

Concerning their size, they tend to go bigger with the new generations (for comfort, and because we have better materials). The bigger they are, the heavier will be the structure, and the more fuel you will use. So it's a tradeoff between comfort and efficiency.

&gt;The very nature of an anarcist (or parecon) system is flawed as it really doesn't work over a large population. 

I'm not an anti-hierarchy anarchist, so I'm not going to argue that it would work well.

&gt;You'd need small independent states to make it function

That doesn't sound like what the anti-hierarchy anarchists talk about when they talk about anarchism.  I thought they wanted to get rid of states.","1312159288"

How can the Republican majority in this Congress explain to their constituents that trillions of dollars in new debt is good for our economy? How can they explain that they think it’s fair to force our children, our grandchildren, our great grandchildren to finance this debt through higher taxes. That’s what it will have to be. Why is it right to increase our nation’s dependence on foreign creditors?
They should explain this. Maybe they can convince the public they’re right. I doubt it. Because most Americans know that increasing debt is the last thing we should be doing. After all, I repeat, the Baby Boomers are about to retire. Under the circumstances, any credible economist would tell you we should be reducing debt, not increasing it.Democrats won’t be making argument to supper this legalization, which will weaken our country. Weaken our county.”

Sen. Harry Reid D-Nevada

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America’s debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can’t pay its own bills. It is a sign that we now depend on ongoing financial assistance from foreign countries to finance our Government’s reckless fiscal policies.
Over the past 5 years, our federal debt has increased by $3.5 trillion to $8.6 trillion.That is “trillion” with a “T.” That is money that we have borrowed from the Social Security trust fund, borrowed from China and Japan, borrowed from American taxpayers. And over the next 5 years, between now and 2011, the President’s budget will increase the debt by almost another $3.5 trillion.
Numbers that large are sometimes hard to understand. Some people may wonder why they matter. Here is why: This year, the Federal Government will spend $220 billion on interest. That is more money to pay interest on our national debt than we’ll spend on Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. That is more money to pay interest on our debt this year than we will spend on education, homeland security, transportation, and veterans benefits combined. It is more money in one year than we are likely to spend to rebuild the devastated gulf coast in a way that honors the best of America.
And the cost of our debt is one of the fastest growing expenses in the Federal budget. This rising debt is a hidden domestic enemy, robbing our cities and States of critical investments in infrastructure like bridges, ports, and levees; robbing our families and our children of critical investments in education and health care reform; robbing our seniors of the retirement and health security they have counted on.
Every dollar we pay in interest is a dollar that is not going to investment in America’s priorities.""

The higher the viewpoint the more enforced it becomes; and the lower the other viewpoints, the more ignored they become.

I'm not sure if moderation actually hinders good discussion. It would have to depend on who is monitoring it.

&gt;How good it would be for the world if Al Qaeda...

There would be no Al Qaeda if the US did not engage in the kind of global atrocities it does. It is well established that the pressure the US has put on militant groups around the world has *increased* their support. Most of the shit the US engages in *completely* relies on the fact it can hide information or lie and get away with it, e.g. Iraq war.

&gt;I don't want details about making an atomic bomb to be public knowledge.

Do you really think they are not public? The atom bomb is pretty simple really. Making long range nuclear ballistic missiles is much harder. This is more about resources than information. Anyone with the will probably can access this info. Certainly anyone who has the resources to want to make a bomb has been able to access it. Those who 'protect' this info actually are quite open with it. As in the case of India and Pakistan.

&gt;I don't want everyone to know if Gillard thinks Obama is a pretentious wanker because it might hurt diplomatic relations.

Because honesty is a bad thing? Don't forget in an open system the reverse knowledge would be available too. Maybe the public would finally see that the petty, personal quibbles of individuals are affecting important political outcomes.

&gt;Of course, we could also go to financial implications, how great the world would be if insider trading ran rampant

How can insider trading be rampant? ONLY if some are able to access privileged information that is denied to others, ie **the current system**. Insider trading is by definition, the use of *exclusive information* to get personal gain. The only reason it is not rampant now is either it is not uncovered, or the penalties work as a deterrent. In an open system insider trading is actually impossible, as everyone can access the 'important information'. 

&gt;if market manipulation was allowed

What? This is only possible in a system like we have now, with information in the hands of so few and so powerful. How can open information access allow market manipulation? If *everyone* had access to it then it would actually have the opposite effect. People could plan better, the information would be disarmed, and the powerful could no exploit this privileged information.

Additionally, market manipulation *is* allowed right now. [link](http://www.reddit.com/tb/j241j) *Because* we have politicians that can hide the fact that they are paid off by corporations. Increasingly, they don't really even bother to hide it. 


Why are some humans so much better and privileged that they deserve to have access to information other people don't?

I'm very sure people/institutions with huge investments in the current system would hate to lose their stranglehold on information, because they use that information to gain power.

Yes, imagine if was war plans were openly known, rendering them useless. It would be amazing. Imagine if politicians had to find better ways to solve problems than the modern equivalent of a caveman bashing your skull in.

It really sounds like you have your mind captured by the current system and can't imagine any alternative to strong hand tactics like war, or insidious back room politics. It's no wonder there is so much corruption in governance around the world. Opening up the dark and dirty places of politics is an awesome thing. People won't act with such impunity if they realise that their evil deeds will come to light, and they at the very least will face public scrutiny.

If you really think that the power players are caring about the greater good by hiding information, then that is quite naive. They only care about their own power.

You only REALLY thought about the problem in light of the current system. Obviously those empowered by the hiding of information will most likely lose out if things changed. I think the overall benefits would be immense.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","Well it's a question of preference really.  I don't care as much for any of the current modes that turn into freeforalls; namely the arena, KoTH and 2Fort.  There's no ""team"" feeling and more importantly you're stuck in the same location for 40 minutes as opposed to moving through different areas like with a payload map.

So yeah, for a gameplay type like arena it would work fine.  But arena gets rid of all the team-based cooperation that actually makes TF2 special in my opinion.  Adding in 4 teams just begs the question, ""Why don't we just have a deathmatch?""  And to me a deathmatch mode and TF2 are practically on opposite ends of the spectrum of the fps genre.  And as someone who plays medic I have a strong distaste for anything that causes individuals to ignore the team.

Now I haven't played TFC; I didn't have a computer in those days.  But generally it seems like we have enough problems trying to get people to work as a group in normal maps that it seems odd to add in more teams.","1312159298"

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Ok, I haven't been to either of the parks you mentioned, but I have been to [Johnson's Shut-Ins](http://mostateparks.com/park/johnsons-shut-ins-state-park), which is incredibly close to Taum Sauk.

I haven't been to Johnson's Shut-Ins in a long time, maybe 15-18 years.  About 6 years ago, the dam there broke and flooded the entire area.  The parks were all closed for several years, if I remember correctly.  I hear, though, that the area is beautiful again--my parents were there just a few weeks ago.  Also in the area is [Elephant Rocks](http://mostateparks.com/park/elephant-rocks-state-park).  You can climb all over the rocks there, which are unbelievably huge.

On a side tangent, I didn't realize you were willing to drive that far outside of St. Louis.  Here's some other things you should check out, if you don't mind driving a bit.

* [Cahokia Mounds](http://cahokiamounds.org/).  It's actually in the Illinois side, about 15 minutes east of St. Louis.  Very fascinating historically, but it [may not be the most photographic of places](http://www.google.com/search?q=cahokia+mounds&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=li&amp;biw=1600&amp;bih=806).

* [Onondaga Cave](http://mostateparks.com/park/onondaga-cave-state-park), south of Leasburg.  I have a friend that gives tours of the cave--it's pretty neat.  The park above-ground is okay, not great.  If you don't mind getting your feet wet, there's a natural spring that feeds into some river whose name escapes me at the moment.  There's a few hiking trails around there if you ignore the signs that say ""only campers past this point.""  Bring bug spray and wear long pants if you plan on hiking though.

* [Meramec State Park](http://mostateparks.com/park/meramec-state-park).  I just visited there last year.  Now this park is beautiful, I wish I had my dad's photos so I could show you what it's like.  The paved trail winds around a [small lake/natural spring](http://www.flickr.com/photos/23200522@N03/3258315303/), which [flows down into a river](http://www.tips-for-camping.com/images/PA_MeramecSpringsParkWaterfall_Plank_041707.jpg) (whose name also escapes me).  There's a small trout hatchery there.  Also in the park is the Old Ironworks.  A long time ago (like, a century ago), it used to be an ironworks, but has since been abandoned.  There's some really [cool](http://mw2.google.com/mw-panoramio/photos/medium/24267501.jpg) freestanding [structures](http://www.rollanet.org/~conorw/cwome/14-maramec_iron_furnace_sm.jpg) dotted throughout the park.

Most any community can find benefit in consensual agreements, and in the delegation of responsibility for those agreements to be upheld.  Indeed, these are things that nearly all anarchists are strongly in favor of.  The deliberate smear against anarchists as seeking disorder and chaos, while very widespread and effective (thanks to the universal clout of its originators in both government and the wealthy), is in fact wildly inaccurate.

Anarchism is a highly organized system of direct democracy and mutually consensual living.  Within that, all kinds of common agreements and delegations of responsibility are possible.  The difference is that these processes are horizontal, without arbitrary hierarchies, and the delegates are always accountable to the community as a whole, who are similarly empowered to redefine the relevant agreements as needed.","1312159302"

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","&gt;There is no such thing as ""setting prices properly"" prices are determined by supply and demand.

And supposedly a properly functioning market will produce an efficient price, right? What did you think ""properly"" meant?

&gt;Interest rates are only low because the Federal Reserve continues to print new money, this is what distorts demand for savings.

That does not make any sense. If the market thought that the U.S. could not pay back its debt and thought it would inflate out of the debt then people would demand higher interest rates on T-bills. The market does not think this will happen.

&gt;So as you can see, government distorts prices because newly printed money creates inflation which results in higher prices.

And the interest rate demanded would included both a risk adjustment and a return to offset expected inflation. 

&gt;To use a very simple example,

Your simple example somehow failed to explain how interest rates are not rising in expectation of a possible U.S. government default, you did not explain how they are not rising to cover that expected inflation.

I'll ask again: if the U.S. has a large chance of default and if the U.S. is facing high inflation how come that is not reflected in T-bill interest rates?

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Us guys just like vaginas. Yours looks great by the way. I know there is a lot of pressure on girls. Fashion mags, any kind of ads, and even porn. We take whatever we get. If companies started only using more plus size models, it would take us about two days to adjust and then our sense of beauty would transform. But then, that's assuming that all guys are the same. We aren't. Some like big breasts, some like small. Some like really thin women, some like bigger. As long as you're healthy, please don't stress it.

Guys have some of the same emotions. I can't speak for every guy, but the Old Spice guy(s) make me a bit self conscious. The commercials are still funny, but it's funny because it's based on a bit of truth. I was at the beach with my girlfriend and a few times I felt completely inadequate around some of the guys around me. I just don't ruminate on those things. I realize that the person I'm with is better than anyone else. She might not have the body of a model or pornstar, but there's more to her than that. Even just physically speaking, I think she's the most beautiful person I know.

I don't fret about other good looking men because I know (or hope) that my gf sees me in the same way. I can't compete physically with a lot of guys, but that's okay. We have something special. Something that can't be broken by a hot body walking by or interacting with one of us.

It sounds like your husband is the same way. As an impartial observer, your pussy is hot! In the special relationship you have with your husband, just know that it rocks his world.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt"," Make up isn't something you just buy in a supermarket. It should be matched to your skin tone, skin type, your style and your budget. How about a trip to to the evil candy store for women (aka Sephora) and have a professional consult you?

I'd say if you never owned any make-up and maybe aren't used to it, start with a natural look that slightly enhances your features: concealer, powder, mascara, and a soft and natural shade of blush and lip gloss. In addition to this you will need a brush for the blush and a different brush for the powder. You don't need the most expensive brands - the Sephora house brand is good quality. You can wash the brushes with baby shampoo which is much cheaper than the Rosemary scented brush cleaner they will try to sell you ;)

In regards to your face cleansers, again go and consult a professional at a beauty salon. Arrange an appointment to have your skin analyse and cleaned out (the basic facial cleansing will suffice). The consultant will tell you which skin type you are and will tell you exactly what your skin needs or doesn't need. Make sure your daily moisturizer has a good sun protection factor and in my own opinion try to keep it natural.

Always tell the consultant what your budget is in advance and stick to it. You don't need the most expensive range and you don't need every single product in the range. I have a roomie who once returned from Sephora crying as these vultures sold her $500 worth of Laura Mercier products and she was too intimidated to refuse. Be prepared, some of these women are scary. (We returned everything the same day.) At the same time don't go for the cheapest no-name supermarket stuff. 


Personally I adore [Sundari](http://www.sundari.com/) products to take care of my skin as they are all natural, worked wonders with my oily skin and they are scented deliciously. 

As for make up, I haven't discovered an all natural brand that works for me yet. During the day I use Dior mascara and lipgloss, Sephora cream powder or Chanel Aqua Lumiere foundation, Nars blush and sometimes a translucent powder or blotting tissue to keep the oily skin under control.","1312159341"

Got into weeks of heated debate with my instructors, and ultimately, got my driver's license, decided not to go to church anymore, and got a job.  
I never got a coherent answer as to why Native Americans who had not heard about God would and should go to hell until a missionary came around and saved them.  
Clearly at this point, I don't believe in God, but back then, I started to question based on illogical positions from my instructors.

"Coffee","t5_2qhze","I like to showcase bright acidity which requires lower brew temps.  This can make extraction challenging.  Options include longer steep, stirring, larger dose and finer grind.  French press pretty much takes the grind adjustment out of play.  The other three parameters are significantly more likely to push the extraction into bitterness before achieving the desired concentration.  The result is watery, under extracted coffee that is also bitter.  If this happens, there is no other choice but to raise the brew temp or use a longer roast to make extraction easier.  Both sacrifice acidity.  The easier it is to extract the bean, the more likely brewing at lower temps will be successful.  Some beans extract very well without showing bitterness, others can only be brewed within a very narrow set of parameters without getting bitter and others are just going to be bitter no matter what you do.  In my experience, using a finer grind makes extraction easier without creating bitterness on it's own.","1312159350"

I also once lost another Curse when I was burning toward a Megathron 70km away, and just when I was getting to the 20km range, turned on my disruptors and was about to orbit at 16km, and the batteries in my wireless mouse died... so I kept approaching and silently, helplessly stared as my ship hugged the blasters, and promptly disintegrated.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","For starters, space and time are not two separate things. They are connected. What that means is that when you move through space, you also move through time. Ok so knowing that, we have to ask ourselves why time passes. Well, it passes because the universe is expanding (see the current big bang LI5), hence, we are moving. This means that the rate that time passes is related to the speed at which you are moving. Because the Earth is moving so fast, speeds like walking around and even planes are not enough to make a noticeable or measurable difference. But if we were to travel around the speed of light, we would start to notice the differences in the rates that time passes. Moving away (for example on a spaceship) from the Earth around the speed of light means that, relative to the speed of the Earth, we are slowing down, and therefore time slows down for the spaceship. I don't know if I hit all the major points and I welcome corrections if they are needed, but that's what I got.

If there was an AmA about a child who once owned toys, I would not question it. I don't care. I know the vast majority of children own toys and for all I know, the person may have been lying but that doesn't change the fact that children own toys. 

In the same way, I know that females often have pictures of themselves released involuntarily, and I know there are men who take advantage of women in disgusting ways. Whether or not it happened to the specific poster is of no consequence to me because I do not know the poster. That poster might as well be one of the people it did actually happen to. The internet is a funny thing that way. A grasp on personality is impossible through anonymity, so putting importance in a name *""nakedandexposed""* means nothing. This is not a person. It is a story. 

And if a person I had a true tangential grasp of claimed to have nude pictures released I wouldn't much care to prove them wrong either. It's like a double prong of **who gives a fuck?**

I don't know how relevant the above is, though. 1500 was top 1000 when I first got there with jiminy, whereas 1700 was top 1000 when I hit it with savvy.  today, 1500:15000, 1700:3000.  it's apples and oranges.

it shouldn't take 100, 300, or 500 games to break 1500 from a fresh account.  if you are good enough to be an 1800 (or whatever people are claiming they secretly are these days) you will find enough exploitable stuff in the 1400s to put up gaudy numbers.  this will not guarantee a win, but it'll produce a winrate in excess of 60%.  I kept that for a long time on savvy, even when I got into the Elo range where I had to play supports every game.  if you took that long to break into a new bracket, to me that would suggest that you polished up your game in the process.  there is NO shame in that.

I will personally fight against any attempts to use public money to build wheelchair ramps.  Everyone knows that disabled people are a notoriously monolithic and liberal voting block.  If you're not healthy enough to walk, no one should be required to pay to help you vote.","1312159394"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","Honestly I think this is a really good idea. There's been a market for real money transactions in diablo for years now (d2legit anyone?) and blizzard formalizing it and making it a much more secure transaction is just a logical step in the right direction. People on this site might not participate in RMT, but with micro-transactions being the new buzzword in Gaming, this was an inevitability. 

The fact remains that this is optional, no one has to do this for their own character. If you want to, great! do it! the option is there, it's secure, and you are even giving a little money back to your fellow player. If you don't? Who cares, the items are still available in game and who knows, maybe you can make a buck or two from someone else. 

While this is definitely not going to be seen favorably by the internet community, its the evolution of the gaming business model whether you like it or not. Studios are going to have to make money from alternative sources if they want to remain viable and everyone can cry out 'activision blizzard is greedy' but it's a business and they're here to make money, and it's going to either come from you or someone else. If you don't like it then don't participate in it, but I have to say that this isn't going to detract from the overall quality of your gaming experience. When you're smashing monsters with your buddies, having an epic experience, the last thing on your mind is going to be 'did billy buy that sword from another dude?'. If anything, this might only enter your mind when you get that legendary barb sword to drop and you think 'what if I can sell this for 5 bucks?'","1312159397"

A son asks his father, ""What can you tell me about politics? I have to learn about it for school tomorrow."" The father thought some and said, ""OK, son, the best way I can describe politics is to use an analogy. Let's say that I'm a capitalist because I'm the breadwinner. Your mother will be the government because she controls everything, our maid will be the working class because she works for us, you will be the people because you answer to us, and your baby brother will be the future. Does that help any?"" The little boy said, ""Well, Dad, I don't know, but I'll think about what you said.""

Later that night, after everyone had gone to bed, the little boy was awaken by his baby brother's crying. Upon further investigation, he found a dirty diaper. So, he went down the hall to his parent's bedroom and found his father's side of the bed empty and his mother wouldn't wake up. Then he saw a light on in the guest room down the hall, and when he reached the door, he saw through the crack that his father was in bed with the maid. The son then turned and went back to bed.

The next morning, he said to his father at the breakfast table, ""Dad, I think I understand politics much better now."" ""Excellent, my boy,"" he answered, ""What have you learned?"" The little boy thought for a minute and said, ""I learned that capitalism is screwing the working class, government is sound asleep ignoring the people, and the future's full of crap.""","1312159399"

"haskell","t5_2qh36","To emphasize jbpriestley's point that import of `Control.Category` is almost unknown, *except* in support of `Control.Arrow`  note that the maybe not-so-reliable
http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&amp;q=import%5C%20Control%5C.Arrow%20lang:haskell&amp;type=cs finds 911 modules importing `Control.Arrow`; http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&amp;q=import%5C%20Control%5C.Category%20lang:haskell&amp;type=cs finds 130 imports almost all of them with `Control.Arrow`. 

The independent imports of `Control.Category` seem to be almost entirely in speculative theoretical modules (bless them), whereas imports of `Control.Arrow`, are followed by library-specific instances. -- This is why we don't see except in connection with `a -&gt; b` and `(a,c) -&gt; (b,c)` and so on; their merit seems to be bound up with the character of specific libraries. (In case you think they belong somehow to the past, note that e.g `hakyll` has been rewritten with an 'arrow interface' just recently; I assume this decision was founded on actual features of the library though it has been giving me some conceptual trouble lately :))

cdsmithus' suggestion that ""But Category and Applicative are very simple, easy, and intuitive"" is certainly true of `Applicative,` but in fact there is no evidence about `Category`, since it is simply unknown in actual or substantive code; I assume its existence is simply an outgrowth of `Control.Arrow`. The `(.)` and `id` he uses in his proofs have almost never been seen in substantive modules. ","1312159402"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","1) I didn't say anything about them being the same person or not. I simply stated that they would have an exactly similar consciousness. I do think they would be the same person, but not because their consciousness is similar. Consciousness is too fleeting and changing a thing to be able to constitute a criterion for personal identity.

2) This 'criterion' is completely circular. Given your definition of the self, you are effectively saying 'You are the same person over time iff you are the same person'.

&gt;If you know that you are going to be the experiencing subject of either the person on side A or side B, then you have a vested interest in that person not experiencing a lot of pain

This might sound counterintuitive to you, but I do not believe that it has to be true that I will be one of the two resulting persons. I do not believe that this has to be true because I do not believe that personal identity should always be determinate, and also because I do not believe that it fundamentally matters in cases like this one. In fact I believe that problems like this one show that we shouldn't always think about situations like this one in terms of personal identity. It is too much of an all-or-nothing concept.","1312159420"

If it's a long multiplayer game like an RTS I think experienced players can see when they've lost, and it's just good sportsmanship to gg and get on to the next one rather than wait for units to cross the map and kill everything. 

If it's a relatively short game like an FPS or fighting game, even when the player knows they've lost I don't think it's worth it to quit when you'll start up a new game pretty quick anyway, and the leftover time you could just use to have fun or get better. 

I'd say it's a tougher decision in variable games like Magic the Gathering, where games could last 5 minutes or 30 minutes. Add in that ""if I just draw that ONE card I need"" mentality, it's a tough call if it's nobler to concede or keep on. ","1312159424"

"books","t5_2qh4i","I managed to get a copy of Les Miserables (unabridged) for about 8 dollars at Borders (before they had their massive liquidation sales and everything), and I would highly recommend the unabridged version.  It's 1463 pages, so you don't have to worry about it feeling too short, and it doesn't water anything down like the abridged version does.  It gets kind of tangential at times, sometimes devoting several chapters to something that even Hugo himself admits has very little to do with the story (like the chapters describing the history of the convent on the petit rue picpus, the history of convents, the philosophy of monasticism and it's role in society) but the writing is beautifully done and gives you such an in-depth, realistic knowledge of the characters that when they do something - even something seemingly random and daring - you can't help but smirk and think ""of course *he* would do that"" or ""why didn't I see that coming? she's just the type of person to say something like that.""

To me, removing that creation from your body is equal to ripping up a drawing a child made for you, or burning down the Louvre. However, if you don't believe in God, this point doesn't resonate with you and wont convince you of anything.

"malefashionadvice","t5_2r65t","While I don't fly, I do spend 22 days out of the month on the road, hopping from hotel to hotel.  I'm a construction worker, so no suits or dress shirts are necessary.

However, I spend a lot of time exploring the towns I'm in, looking for women or just a good time in general.  I know it's not the norm in the construction industry - but I like to look good when doing so.

I carry a week's worth of clothing in a duffel bag, here's what it contains:

* Work jeans: Whatever jeans are no longer worthy of going out in.  I'll wear these to work every day.
* 4 work shirts.  Our company provides these.
* Socks - white for work, with a few short and long pairs of black socks
* Running shoes: I try to clock a few miles every other day, even when I'm on the road.
* Dress shoes.  Nothing fancy, just some black leather boots that are lightweight, comfortable, and slightly worn to suit the rest of my apparel.
* Black V-neck t-shirt:  I prefer one that doesn't dip too low on the chest.  It's simple, can be re-worn, but it's still classy enough for an up-scale bar or casual enough for a dive.
* Boxer briefs
* Levi Slim Fit Jeans:  Usually a darker blue or light gray.  I switch out between a few pairs, but only ever bring one pair with me.  They go well with the black shirt, and the black leather boots.
* Not related to fashion, but worthwhile: I bring an electric burner to cook dinner.  It's a great way to eat healthy (and better food) on the road while improving your skills as a cook and saving money.


As far as avoiding wrinkles:  the easiest fix would be to get some solid shell luggage.  Usually things get wrinkled when they get moved or jostled inside your bag / luggage.  Having something that doesn't flex helps to prevent this.  Another easy fix is to fold your dress shirts and then insert a piece of cardboard into them.  I carry a soft bag, and I've found that laying my shirts out (i.e. not folding them) helps.

I have the same issue about worrying I'm not good enough for my girlfriend and all it does is make me feel terrible so I basically just block it. Whenever a negative though comes to my mind I just let it pass without thinking too much on it. It's difficult but you have to try. Usually I try to ignore any anxiety and just be myself, it's not too difficult at parties because I drink heavily and then my girlfriend thinks I'm the funnest person in the world.

If the engine compresses the fuel too much, the cylinder charge will fire too soon, or ""detonate"", as the piston is coming up towards top-dead-center. This can cause engine damage, even in the very sturdy Diesel design. Oppositely, if not enough compression is achieve, the fuel will not ignite. 

Some more modern, and very clever, diesel engines can run on many fuels without modification. The Russian T72 tank uses a diesel engine which can run on diesel, gasoline, or aviation/turbine fuel. This is accomplished by altering the timing and fuel injection pressure, IIRC.","1312159472"

In addition, now that there would presumably be a secure system for trades, more people may use it. However, can you really call Blizzard down and ""cause an uproar"" for something like this?

Please stop being narrow-minded and consider that, just maybe, this isn't the end of the world.","1312159473"

I will list wineries(no on-site vines) only in Houston and surrounding areas.  There are more options when you plan to go more than 30 minutes out of Houston.  Also, a few of these let you make your own wine.

"canada","t5_2qh68","- Vancouver is the most expensive city to live in in Canada. Limited land, great weather, and being referred to as ""Manhattan with mountains,"" doesn't exactly help keep real estate prices reasonable. That being said, it is consistently rated as one of the best places to live in the world.
- Yes, permanent residents and citizens are eligible for all of the social welfare and healthcare programs that the government makes available. If you are not a PR/citizen, you and your family will be eligible for public healthcare if you are employed. I do not think you are eligible if you are a university student. However, your graduate program should cover the costs and provide you with a ""university health insurance"" program or something similar.
- I'm not sure the job market is much better than in the US. It is better in provinces such as Alberta or Saskatchewan, but not necessarily in Quebec and Ontario that depend more heavily on manufacturing and services than on natural resources. I don't know about BC. Anyway, as US citizens, you are not at a disadvantage and employers should not hesitate to hire you, provided you have the skills required.
- One of the nice things about being a foreign student in Canada is that the government has introduced a lot of programs to entice foreigners to stay in Canada upon graduation. It is easier for you to get a work permit upon graduation (if you are in a NAFTA-covered job, then there's basically nothing other than showing up at the border with a letter from your employer) and for you to transition to permanent residency (you are even allowed to apply while you are in your student status, and many provinces will sponsor you as ""nominees"" under the provincial nominee class). The best part is that your spouse is allowed to work in Canada while you are a student (she may have to apply for a work permit first). For more details, see [here](http://www.cic.gc.ca).
- I think you will indeed provide the best of both worlds by moving to Canada to raise your children. Having a more resource-based economy will ensure that Canada's long term prospects are a bit more stable than those of the US, as you will always find buyers for lumber, oil, minerals and water. If things in Canada turn sour, your children can always exercise their right as US citizens to move back and make a living in the US.

EDIT: As you are thinking of pursuing graduate studies, don't forget to apply for all the scholarships and fellowships that you are eligible for. You should be eligible for NSF awards, although you may not be eligible for more elite awards like the Hertz or NDSEG which typically require you to use them at a US institution (I may be wrong about NDSEG). The Canadian equivalent of these awards is granted by the NSERC (or SSHRC or CIHR depending on your discipline). You must be a Canadian citizen or a PR to be eligible for either the ""PGS"" (post-graduate scholarship) or ""CGS"" (Canada graduate scholarship - more money) awards. However, non-citizens/non-PRs *are* eligible for the Vanier CGS, the most coveted award of them all, that pays a shit ton of money (on the order of $50k per year). You can also look into scholarships given by the provincial government (in Ontario they are called ""Ontario Graduate Scholarships;"" don't know about BC) as eligibility for those may be determined only by studying in an institution in that province and not by citizenship.","1312159486"

There is a general consensus that our midfield isn't exactly top notch, though it does have considerable depth. Fletcher, Carrick, Anderson, Gibson, Fletcher, (Not to mention Giggs, Young and Rooney who could easily cover there).

A 1BR apartment with a decent view can run you over $3,000/month easily.  Upgrade to 2BR, and it easily shoots up over $4,500/month.  That kind of money could get you an upscale single-family home in most parts of the country.","1312159493"

I would agree that without surface tension the water-air interface would not be as smooth as it appears in this image. OP could argue that this is what he is referring to.

Imagine she is in a pit of small glass beads instead of a pool. A pile of glass beads does not have surface tension, but the beads do have mass and feel friction. That is enough to create a transient layer like this with a certain thickness.

"IWantOut","t5_2r5hw","I graduated in History and I've never worked a job I didn't love. And now I'm going to be living and working in Spain starting September. Honestly, your degree is more ""useful"" than mine. So I really don't think that going back to school is necessary unless you WANT to. Not to try to make yourself ""marketable"". 

However, I do know this is recession and I'm probably just very fortunate (also I've been working since I was 15 so despite having a ""bad"" degree, I still look excellent on paper) . But I don't want you to feel forced to get some new piece of paper or line on a resume if you won't enjoy the job. 


The only reason that I don't think you should force yourself to go back to school or take classes is because you're asking people what you should do. That's never a good sign. If you don't know what you want, forcing yourself to go into something that's more likely to be profitable will not make you happy. If you're good at IT and like it, or at doctoring or being a chemical engineer then go for it but don't think that you NEED to. 

Though, in the interest of time and money (since you said you don't want another degree necessarily) maybe take non-credit courses at community colleges that are skill-focused. 

However, there's always opportunity out there. Don't be pessemistic. It's good to be realistic, but don't sacrifice your passion for society's norms. You never HAVE to be a ""papermonkey"". Those people let themselves be boxed in because life is money-centric. And yes I know you can't just get up and leave a job without security but you can make plans that don't involve selling yourself out if they're not immediately available. Hell, the amount of time you'd take to be in school you can be making connections and studying up on alternative ways to getting abroad, applying for programs etc. 

There are many websites for getting jobs abroad.

I see it all the time... all skill no emotion or express. Those are the kind of musicians to avoid. Hope he does well in his solo project.

Also his sound blows.. it's aritifical delayed crap. Get a real guitar and put it on a tube amp.. maybe add an OD pedel. Give up that shitty sounding digital preamp and effects.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","Ok, are you aware of the fact that if C is a constant then d/dx(C)=0, right (the derivative in terms of x of C equals zero)? (If not, then I won't be able to explain this to you at all). This means that when you derive a constant, ""C"", by x the derivative is 0 (because there is no slope). Now, ""C"" and ""x"" are just variable names, there isn't anything special about them, and ""C"" can be any constant. So we can say "" C = e^x "", where C, e, and x are all constants. Now, we can say d/dy (e^x) = 0, or in english, the derivative in terms of y of e to the x is equal to zero. This is because there is no 'y' in the equation e^x, so all of those variables are constants. No matter what the value of y is, e^x will always have the same value. Therefore we can treat it as a constant.","1312159550"

"newzealand","t5_2qhma","Directly calling for marijuana to be sold like tobacco or alcohol makes the public think of marijuana abuse by those who can't handle it so I strongly suggest that you won't achieve anything with that tactic. You'll notice that no political party in parliament advocates for legalization. No politician will go near it because it's politically untenable to call for the complete legalization of marijuana. 

**However** there is a way to get legal pot and America has shown the correct tactic: call it ""medical marijuana"" and you avoid the 99% of the public's complaints because the public are now thinking of an extremely sick person who wants relief. The Greens support it, ACT probably would, and those against it look like heartless monsters.  Medical marijuana *is* politically tenable. 

After medical marijuana was legalised in the U.S. what happened next was that &lt;1&gt; marijuana magazines were soon full of adverts from dodgy doctors who would basically sell access to it, and &lt;2&gt; there were online guides tell people what symptoms to fake to convince legit doctors. A few years later and there are [more marijuana dispensaries than liquor stores in Denver and California](http://www.denverpost.com/frontpage/ci_14112792?source=rss#ixzz0bqgG6jXH). Doctors sell a 'pot card' and it's become effectively legalised.

You're fighting an uphill battle when you argue for complete legalization ... change your tactics and you'll get somewhere. I strongly suggest that you fight for the brand of 'medical marijuana' instead.

There are some extremely out there arguments made by a lot of the anti-hierarchy schools of thought tho so I wouldn't be surprised if there is something out there making that exact argument. 

It does not make sense to me, but a lot of people who claim to be anarchists fail to understand it simply and instead see it as some form of reactionary force against oppression which in turn leads to them condoning some pretty oppressive actions.

"mylittlepony","t5_2s8bl","No, I think this is just a subtle presentation of the theory that Twilight Sparkle _is_ Luna... of the past! At some point in the near future she will be teleported back in time (probably due to a failed attempt at casting a group teleport spell) and the magic will interact with her Element of Harmony to transform her into an alicorn! Then, stranded in the past, she will attempt to go to Celestia for help... only to find that she's an evil tyrant! Twilight (now cast as ""Nightmare Moon"" in propaganda by Celestia) will try to overthrow her, using the Elements of Harmony to attempt to banish Celestia to the Sun. Instead the Elements shatter Celestia's hardened heart, letting the magic of friendship into her soul!

But the banishment spell has been cast, it's unstoppable now! Nobly sacrificing herself for the sake of her now-reformed future teacher, Twilight interjects herself as the target and is banished to the Moon! There, in a thousand years of solitude, madness overtakes her mind and she comes to believe she really _is_ Nightmare Moon. Finally, a thousand years later, the spirits of her friends and fellow Elements (who were cast back in time with her and died in the battle with Tyrant Celestia, whereupon they became stars due to the backwash of the banishment spell) succeed in freeing her. Whereupon her younger self frees her from the prison of her madness. Celestia takes the disoriented Luna/Twilight away to Canterlot before she can inadvertantly spill the beans to her younger self and cause a paradox, hence explaining why we haven't seen Luna since then. She's busy at Canterlot recovering her memories.

"canada","t5_2qh68","Why hello there.

To give you an idea of my frame of reference: My mom immigrated to Canada from the US in the early '70's, My husband lives in Texas, I live in Ontario, and I hate immigration processes everywhere. In the last 4 months I've gone from filling out apps to have my husband move here, to filling out apps to move me down there. So I've got a pretty good idea on a ton of this stuff.

The nitty gritty: From what I understand, you don't need a visa to come from the US in order to study. Talk to the program administrators, as they're going to be your best sources of information on this - they've likely done it a LOT.  However: that doesn't address the issue of your fiancee. There's no such thing as a fiance visa anymore, so in order to bring your fiancee in, if she's not studying, you may have to jump through some hoops, depending on your entry circumstances. If you get in, and she doesn't have a similar opportunity to enter, you'd have to either marry her in advance, or apply as Common Law, wherein you'd've had to live together for a year, and prove it. Marriage is BY FAR the easiest way to do it - even if you do a quick &amp; dirty town hall ceremony, with a party later. If you don't want to be living apart - which, i can tell you from the experience of having spent 12 weeks of my 9 months of marriage actually in my husband's company, really fucking sucks - this may be your primary concern.

The social benefits are good. Health care coverage, at least in Ontario, kicks in after 3 months of legal permanent residency. If you're going to UBC, they'll probably help you with this. If you get in legally, and your partner doesn't, that can be a problem. When we were doing up the paperwork for my husband, I had to promise to cover all his expense for 3 years - so if he had to go on welfare for anything other than a health related concern, we were up shit creek and he'd be sent home. I don't know whether or how this applies if you do it via employment. 

Cost of living in Canada is VERY VERY HIGH. This is sometimes shocking to Americans. Not as high as Europe, but still. Milk in southern ontario is approaching $5/gal, and gas is about $5.50/gal. Fruits and vegetables, despite being trucked up from the US for the large part, are cheaper. Don't ask me why. You're also going to pay significantly higher taxes, both in the form of income tax and sales tax - sales tax in Ontario is 13%. ""Free"" health care is not, in fact, free. But the peace of mind it brings me, is, to my mind, quite worth it.

The difference in personalities is strong. Canadians tend to be a more quiet, reserved, and ""polite"" nice, rather than the US's gregarious ""bear hug"" variety of nice. If we know there's a need, or we know the individual, we're so happy to help out it's ridiculous. We tend to be more empathetic towards those less fortunate, be it health, race, or gender.  There's less overt patriotism, but what is there is *very* strong. Keep in mind, as well, that there is no legal free speech, in Canada. (He isn't racist, but he does say things for shock value that could, in theory, get him fined or arrested.) 

None of this is meant to put a damper on your view of Canada (and really, this post in general may get me downvoted all to hell.) I love Canada. I REALLY love Canada, and I'm at times very frustrated with the circumstances that are causing me to have to move. I love it for all that it is, and all that it isn't, but I think a lot of people have this perfectly rosy view of it, and then get here and are shocked that it isn't the way they imagined. I like both countries the same, really - there are things about the US that I love, as well. They're different - they each have pros and cons - but having grown up splitting my time between the two, I find crazies in each (more in texas, sorry), I find glorious people in each. I find tremendous natural beauty in each. But they are still very different in a lot of ways. If you've got any more specific questions, feel free to PM anytime.

Yeah, my kids will pick up my nasty habits too. Only smoking is higher stakes than my hideous car-cussing. 

What do you think you should do? Someone has to talk to the niece, because she may or may not be smoking already. The niece is also not an appropriate caregiver for the 8 year old, even for minutes on a porch alone. It sucks, but she just doesn't have the good judgement required.

You need to tell your 8 year old about smoking, how it's addictive and unlike other things that adults enjoy it's meant to be addictive from minute one. 

Many many people have a cocktail here and there and there's no meaningful consequence or addiction, but cigarettes are made to take your power away. They are formulated in such a manner that smoking one makes you want another. Casual smokers don't exist in any real numbers. 

You can talk to your 8 year old about how her body needs to grow and it's important to not smoke until she is an adult. You can tell her that it breaks your heart. 

If you want to be more honest with her you can tell her about the damage it is doing to your body, but I'm not sure it's fair to burden a child with that. I'm also not sure that self flagellation is good parenting. It's up to you to decide. 

I think you fucked up, but I want you to know that I've dropped each of my kids twice, I've lost my temper in front of them more times than I care to remember, I've.... oh please what haven't I done wrong? If you're a parent long enough something will be your fault. I'm guessing that this can be a blip on the radar if you really talk to her about smoking, expectations, PLAYING WITH MATCHES(!!!!) and the difference between an adult vice and kids.

Thom's rhythm on piano is oddly syncopated so it never feels like it is on the ""right"" beat (except at the beginning of the phrase), but if you think about a jazz song that swings, the rhythm makes more ""sense.""  Drumming along to this song (especially at the beginning) first opened my eyes to the simplicity and complexity of the song.  

About Phil, I'd have to say that there is no single song that best defines Phil's drumming.  Looking at his repertoire as a whole it is easy to see how much of a well-rounded and professional drummer he really is.  Hell, just look at him live!  He locks in the tempo and never strays, and changes time signatures without a hitch...consistency is something special in drumming, and Phil is the epitome of a consistent drummer.  Furthermore, he knows his place in the group with which he performs.  He never out does the song.  His groove is tight and sufficient, leaving the listener with just the right amount of percussive delight.  

I envy Phil's skills both as a drummer and as a musician.","1312159679"

Scenario: 3 months after release, there's like a thousand of Item X on the auction hall. Naturally, the price is going to drop which means there won't be as much for Blizz to make from the cut. How do they make more money? release more content, with more items that people can trade. The more frequent the content updates with new items, the more trading that goes on. If they're savvy at all about this, it means even if you *don't* like real money trading, your'e going to be getting tons of new items every few months with new bosses, dungeons, etc just to support the RMT practice. Win-win situation.","1312159681"

As for the co-op. It's pretty good. It's just as one would imagine Portal with four portals would be. You can screw over your friends by misplacing a portal and killing them, but you really aren't rewarded or anything. It's really set-up to solve the puzzle, move forward. The single player is amazing though. Sags in the middle, but the bookend sections make up for that completely.","1312159683"
"golf","t5_2qhcs","I like Rehoboth a lot.  Used to go to Ocean City MD but Rehoboth is much cleaner.  Rehoboth is apparently a beach mecca for gay people, but honestly thats why I think its so clean and nice.

My folks usually get a house so I haven't had to search for places myself.  Foodwise my cousin owns a restaurant called Henlopen City Oyster House which is really tasty.  Obie's on the boardwalk is greasy junk food, but tastes good and has a really nice setting by the beach.

Theres 3 big outlet malls like 15 min outside of Rehoboth which are a huge attraction.  Picked up a nice Polo coat for 30$ yesterday.  Right at the end of main street the Navy Band plays free concerts a few times a week too, that is fun. 

tl;dr Rehoboth nightlife is mainly for the gay community, but if you just want to relax it is way better than the other beaches in the area.","1312159683"

After a few years, a new industry has come to town and the city is growing. Now there are traffic jams and accidents every day on this freeway.

The Department of Transportation folks get together and draw up plans to build a new freeway that has 4 lanes in each direction. This will help the traffic move better because the road can handle more cars at once.

The first highway is a 32 bit processor; the second is a 64 bit; the cars are the information the chip processes.

"audio","t5_2qhms","A lot of us aren't keen on surround.  I used to run 5.1 it and think it is a sales gimmick.  Yes, you do hear sound to the sides and behind you, but does that really add to the enjoyment of watching something?  Not for me.  I only run two high-end speakers with video.  The center isn't necessary - stereo takes care of that.  I won't run a sub, either.  They seem like a good idea, but they're difficult to place and even more difficult to get them to blend correctly with speakers.  It's not worth the expense or hassle.

I would strongly recommend not buying the Sony setup.  They're probably injection-molded plastic boxes with terrible speakers inside.  A lot of them roll off before the cheap sub kicks in, so you'll be missing part of the signal.  They will not sound good.  At all.  

With your budget, you could get one of the pairs I usually recommend.  First are the PSB Alpha B1 bookshelf speakers.  I think they list around $279, but I got a pair closer to $200 for my parents.  They don't reach as deep as floorstanders can, but they really do sound excellent.  Check *Stereophile's* review - I think they were their budget component of the year a year or two ago.  Two of these will outshine any of those plasticky HTIB speakers.  You'll find yourself listening to a lot more music, too, since they sound good.

The other budget pair of speakers I love is the magnepan MMG.  $600 new, but usually $400 or so used.  (Check Audiogon.)  These are something special and one of the best bargains in audio.  Google around for reviews and you'll see just how well loved the MMG is.

Skip the 5-channel receivers.  I'd recommend finding an old 2-channel receiver off Craigslist, eBay, thrift stores, garage sales, etc.  Maybe you already have an old one.  You should be able to find one for $20-$50 or so.  Put the rest into speakers, because that's where the performance is.

If you want to spend a little more, look at integrated amps (containing a preamp and power amp) or separate preamps and power amps.  Brands I think are of good quality and good price are Marantz, NAD and Adcom.  There's a lot of other great equipment out there, but those are among the best values.

Anyhow, give some serious thought to running just two channels with high-end speakers.  I won't go back to the cheap plastic box speakers.  ","1312159692"

But you'll recognize them by the traditional attire - dark trousers, wide hats and especially the long colorful dresses worn by the women. Though I believe the ones in the UK and Ireland have moved on to tracksuits as of late.

They speak Romanian because they were born and grew up here, but they also speak their own language, which we don't understand. The ones in Hungary speak Hungarian + their own language and so on. They also take Romanian, Hungarian and Bulgarian last names, which makes it even more confusing, even though sometimes they have more special given names.

As for their origin, they came from India during the Middle Ages as a nomadic people and used to be slaves in the Romanian principates until the 19th century when they were emancipated. The Romanian people have evolved on Romania's territory for over 2000 years (Dacian and Roman substrate, heavy Slavic influence after the Romans left, some Magyar and Turkish/Ottoman influence - genetically, culturally and linguistically). Which is why I said we don't share much with the Gypsies apart from a territory.

They are Romanian in the sense that they possess Romanian citizenship, but they're not ethnically Romanian. For instance Hungarians and Russians are other recognized minorities in Romania - officially they're ""Romanian citizens of Hungarian ethnicity"", which grants them the right to study in their own language, use it in public administration and so on. So they belong to the country, but not to the Romanians as an ethnic group.","1312159699"

You're yelling at each and he's in the middle!"".

They looked at me, and made the following proposal, I said: ""I tell ya what, I think there should be a rule that would solve all bar room arguments. The rule should be, that the drunkest person is always right.""

There was a silence, it seemed like everyone like the idea, eventually one of the people next to me said: ""you're like a closet genius!"".

"Atlanta","t5_2qiq9","i loved their old SERO $30 + $6 (atlanta tax) plan. but man their phones did stink as far a selection. wimax aka clearwire really stinks coverage wise - skip it. their 3G is ok - i got 1 to 2 meg consistently ITP - but i've noticed AT&amp;T i've been getting 5 meg down alot lately. they do not seem to mind if you tether. it might be worth checking out their mvno (boost mobile) - think you get the same service quality but its cheaper for unlimited plan - same quality of service. i did get slammed every other month with $9 charges which were resolved by their customer chat - this was annoying to deal with.  CDMA is better at tower handoffs so you don't get dropped calls when you are driving around. I also did not like that you had to drop the 1xRTT (or nothing depending on the phone) when you are calling/texting since their phones only had one modem (comparing to AT&amp;T) - streaming high quality internet audio - text comes in or call - it drops it and you have to restart the app.

otherwise the service is really solid ITP.

1. steer clear of wimax - it's dying and clear is not upkeeping their infrastructure
2. find a good phone/plan that you can live with.
3. consider boost mobile if your credit isn't great and your roaming needs are limited - it may be cheaper.
4. check for corporate discounts (AT&amp;t calls them FAN)
5. be prepared to deal with slamming of $9 fees - sprint just removes them and gives you a free ringtone for the trouble - so they know it's happening.

If you have unlimited verizon data - grandfathered - i'd probably just stick with that. sprint is still losing a metric ton of money and eventually that is going to catch up with them. I'd bet $50 once they dump wimax and go LTE (and get the iphone) their unlimited plans will go the way of the others. iirc at least one of their mvno (virgin?) is already testing throttling in some market segments. 

otherwise  yeah i thought their service was solid. You might be able to buy out an old SERO account from someone else if you don't care for a fancy phone. that's $30 per phone (450 mins/unlimited text+data/7pm nights/free mobile2mobile) plus $6 tax per line. I've seen folks on slickdeals sell their plans for $50-200. not a bad deal but again phone  choices are extremely limited.

It is time to be brutally honest. If we pass a health care bill that does not address frivolous medical lawsuits, fails to make insurance companies compete or provide real choice to our citizens, has someone bought too much access? We have traded access in the political system for guaranteed special interest outcomes. This must stop. Our political system, our decision-makers are indebted to all the wrong things--money--all of it corrupt and all of it making real change just a nice tag line in a speech.

"NewToTF2","t5_2rbtk","Check out [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaMeZoV5-qs). It helped me out a lot when I started with medic.

Also keep in mind that whatever advice you get here is mostly opinion. That being said..

The Ubersaw is the best melee weapon. The Vita-saw is worthless, The Solemn Vow is gimmicky but can be very useful. The Amputator is only worthwhile if you use the Crusader's Crossbow with it for the set bonus.

For primary I generally stick with the default syringes. That's only because I don't have the Overdose. The Blutsauger tends to give me a feeling like I have a license to be a battle medic, which is not credit to team. The Crossbow reloads too slowly to be able to reliably defend yourself with it.

For medigun there's a simple rule. Offence means Uber. Defence means Kritzkrieg or Uber. Kritz is generally useless on offence as you are usually having to take down a sentry nest, and crits don't affect buildings at all. For all-around best though, the stock Medigun is it because you just can't beat 8 seconds of invulnerability. I don't particularly care for the Quick Fix, but it's useful for healing a lot of people quickly.

As for staying alive, the advice goes for all classes. Keep looking around and don't stand still. All classes are extremely effective at killing people if they have the element of surprise on their side.

As for when to uber, if you're about to die, uber. If there's a sentry nest and you have a demo or something, uber. Other team ubers, wait a second and uber. A lot of enemies in a room? Uber. Don't be afraid to pop it prematurely, but don't die with it at 100%.","1312159735"

"reddit.com","t5_6","Our emissions standards for diesel passenger cars and trucks are absurd and WAY stricter than Europe, Japan, Australia or any other 1st world country.  This is the real reason we don't see many small or medium displacement diesels in cars and trucks in the US.

The cost of the emissions systems needed to put them into compliance with US regulations far exceeds the money you would save over 10 years from increased fuel efficiency.  Furthermore these complex emissions control devices (such as urea injection, EGR coolers, and a diesel particulate filter) negate the mechanical advantages of a diesel engine in the first place and increase complexity (DPFs decrease fuel efficiency, EGRs increase soot in engine oil and combustion lowering longevity, and the urea injection will put the car or truck in limp mode or simply disable the truck if not filled regularly).  Finally these new emissions control devices actually prevent the usage of biodiesel, wvo, and other renewable diesel fuel substitutes (read attached)

http://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/alternative-fuel/biofuels/4311498


If you want to change this bitch and moan to congress to have separate lower standards for diesel cars and trucks (like Europe) and get the California CARB board to go to hell and disappear (never going to happen).  From what I can see unfortunately we will keep having a de facto ban on most diesel cars and trucks except for the huge towing 3/4+ ton trucks from the big three which are way more than most of us need.  It's really ironic that more fuel efficient vehicles that could actually provide an immediate decrease in national oil consumption get excluded in the name of environmental protection.  

ps.

The reason BMW, Mercedes, VW, Audi can sell some diesels here is they can hide the cost of their expensive emissions control systems in their overinflated sticker prices to begin with.  ","1312159756"

Yeah, I guess I just tend to think of PSUs in terms of maxing out your load and what's a safe max load wattage for your PSU, mainly because I'm generally concerned with gaming, photo work, and general use.  If it were a machine that tends to have a more constant wattage draw (like a rendering machine) as opposed to one that's constantly fluctuating, I'd be looking at PSUs that are most efficient at the average PSU load.

&gt; Hopefully the psu you buy has a much higher peak rating then it does an average rating. 

Definitely.  That's one of many reasons of why PC Power and Cooling, Seasonic, and Enermax tend to be such well regarded PSUs.  Check out Hardware Secrets and see some of the ridiculous wattages he can pull from lower wattage PSUs (Gabe has a hardon for overloading PSUs and most of his tests include an overload test).  If your PSU rated wattage is it's peak wattage, you should generally stay away from it and most review sites won't pass it.","1312159756"

(A lot of times the outer cups I put less beer in and as you get closer to the center of all the cups I fill them up more)  Everyone stands around the table and bounces ping pong balls into 2-3 cups (depending on how many ppl are playing).  Like the famous game quarters, the cups get passed clockwise around the table and once cup B catches up to Catch A that is when you ""Boom"" the person.  When doing this the person with Cup B swats Cup A person's cup off the table.  Then Cup B goes to the next person in line and the person who was boomed grabs a cup from the center of the table, drinks it, and starts shoot again.  If you make the ping pong ball into your cup on the first try you can give it to anyone at the table.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Just like almost anything, it's value is simply tied to public perception. You can't eat gold. You can't build a house out of it and you cannot use it to wash your clothes. It's value is derived from the expectation that somebody else will see it as valuable. This is not intrinsic. The same is true with money. Gold, however, has historically been perceived as valuable, as it doesn't tarnish and can be easily formed to make jewelry. 

Would I invest in gold or silver? No. It's currently in a [bubble](http://www.kitco.com/LFgif/au75-pres.gif) that is eventually going to pop. When? I haven't a clue, but I know that ""the value can only go up"" is total horse-shit.

"tf2","t5_2qka0","I've read your post and agree on the points but it's never that easy.
First, I completely agree on point 1 and 2.  It's annoying setting up a base and then a random Engineer comes and takes ammo and starts building.

Now for your other points.  I do point 3 often because my team offers no help in protection and constantly take the metal.  I'm tired of getting all my things blown up easily when at least one player could help.  Spies, scouts, pyros, well any class really can take my out unless I have a level 3 sentry and even then if I don't have enough metal then a demo, soldier, and heavy has no problem either.  As usual, no help from my team for protection.

Point 4:  I've played a lot of engineer on many servers (especially reddit great lakes) to know when my team is going to get rolled past the first points.  Especially on great lakes depending on who is on what team.  I would love to put up my things but if my team won't help it's a waste of time.  This happens A LOT on Great Lakes.

What would be nice if a random person would upgrade my teleporter to level 3 while I set up but that rarely happens.  We don't need 3 scouts or pyros or soldiers sitting around waiting at start up.  Help the engineer.  Also, when I have my tele up, most of the time the person just leaves me to defend against spies by myself.  There are too many classes and weapons that can take out sentries 1 vs 1.

A good example is badwater first point.  I can set up but a bonk scout and sticky jumper demo always get past and destroy my teleporter entrance.  I tell my team but they just use my teleporter and never pay attention as my entrance gets blown up.  This is why I build my teleporter exit last in case I get ambushed and all my things get destroyed.  It's so I don't have to relevel my sentry.  Sure, maybe a team mate might come through and help but that rarely happens.

I'm basing this experience on playing on Great Lakes a lot.
I love playing engineer but without help from the team it's often no fun unless I'm going battle engi.","1312159772"

"india","t5_2qh1q","New Delhi has made its share of economic mistakes in recent years, but its marquee employment program is in a league by itself. The scheme, which began in 2005 to offer social security to millions of rural poor, is instead shunting those people into expensive underemployment while real employers struggle to find workers. It's such a disaster that one branch of the government this month asked another temporarily to stop enforcing the law.

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, as the jobs scheme is now called, promises 100 days of work per year to the unemployed at a minimum daily wage currently around 120 rupees ($2.70). Since this is higher than the lowest pre-existing private-sector daily wages in many areas, the program has encouraged workers to shift from private employment to the public dole.

Critics of this welfare program always worried about the fiscal strain, and sure enough the program's annual outlay is now $9 billion. It is fast becoming the largest entitlement in India. But now other unintended consequences are coming into focus, a severe labor shortage worst of all.

The minimum wage the program sets is hurting employers who can't afford to match it, while forcing those who can to pay more for labor. This vise is especially squeezing farmers in fertile Punjab state in the north who can't find field hands. That's why the Agriculture Ministry has asked the Rural Development Ministry, which administers the program, to halt it during peak farming seasons like the current sowing one. Local media reported last week that Rural Development Minister Jairam Ramesh had said no to this request.

That means the scheme's distortions will become more widespread. Rural wages in some states are climbing faster than India's 9% inflation rate. An agricultural commission noted this year that these labor costs are contributing to the rise in food prices—a problem currently fixating the ruling Congress Party, though the government's solution, predictably, is to expand welfare.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Particle physics is the study of the very small bits of matter that everything is made of (particles). On the theoretical side, we have a very good idea of how these things interact. The model we use accurately describes all of our everyday experiences—light, magnetism, et cetera. It also makes some interesting predictions about things that *don't* happen in our everyday lives, like what happens when different types of these particles collide at very high speeds. A particle accelerator is a *very* large device designed to test whether these predictions are correct.

To do this, the accelerator basically uses a bunch of large magnets to push a stream of particles around in either a circle or a straight line, constantly getting faster, until that stream is allowed to hit something (either another stream or a stationary target of some kind). When they collide, jets of new particles come out and we can compare the composition of those jets to the predictions of the theory.

One piece of the model that we haven't confirmed yet is the existence of a ""Higgs boson"", which is a particle that is supposed to be responsible for the masses of the other particles. Finding this, or establishing lower bounds for *its* mass, is one of the major goals of the people working on the LHC.","1312159805"

"india","t5_2qh1q","Other facets of the employment scheme are hindering the development of India's labor market. The program offers hardly any worker training that might boost participants' productivity and prepare them to one day command a higher wage from the private sector. As a result, workers are literally digging and refilling ditches instead of gaining marketable skills.

The scheme also is arresting labor mobility. Market forces would normally encourage workers to flee poor states such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in favor of prosperous farms in Punjab or, more importantly, the cities—places where workers could naturally move up the productivity and wage ladders. The employment program makes it easier for workers in backward areas to stay where they are and scrape by on the government dole.

Most policy makers never saw these effects coming. The scheme was billed as a form of unemployment insurance, the Congress Party's sop to those afflicted by cyclical joblessness. But by offering a legal entitlement anybody could claim, the government has slowed down job creation. If workers never manage to gain new skills, cyclical unemployment could become structural.

The irony is that unemployment and underemployment in India truly are problems the government needs to tackle. Unemployment is difficult to quantify, but a government survey released last year pegged 9.4% of the work force as jobless for more than six months.

But New Delhi completely misunderstood the solution. Many parts of India actually suffer a dearth of formal employment opportunities, because India's socialist-era labor regulations discourage employers from hiring and firing people easily. This has pushed more than 90% of workers into the illegal, informal sector, which formerly could pay below mandated minimum wages, only to now find itself hit by the government's jobs scheme. The solution is to deregulate the labor market, not offer another handout that further calcifies that market.

Delaying this deregulation delays India from reaping its demographic dividend. India may not be the only country to disrupt its labor market with bad policies, but it bears higher costs for its mistakes. The country's labor force numbers 500 million, and is set to add 110 million in the next decade—an advantage Asian economies like Japan and even China envy. The right reform could help Indians capitalize on this advantage.","1312159809"

She then starts yelling (very loudly) about how I just gave someone else water. She then yells out, ""Is it because im black?!"" I was stunned at her stupidity.

"programming","t5_2fwo","I'm down the street at Harvard, studying CS. The financial aid system means that few students have to take out loans of any sort, so there is little to pay off (relative to other schools, despite the nominal tuition cost) post graduation.

Yet 20-45% of each class goes to finance or consulting each year. Here's the weird bit: we don't even have a management/finance/business curriculum. Accounting isn't even an offered class.

Superficially, the $$ is a big draw. But there's considerably more to it than that - a great article on the phenomenon i shere http://baselinescenario.com/2010/05/04/why-do-harvard-kids-head-to-wall-street/

You could argue about the value to society, productive contributions, etc etc... but if you get down to it being a UXUI dev at Google or a developer at Jane Street Capital are both pretty insular contributors compared to, say, being an EMT.

The finance world has put smart people together in an environment that allows them to benefit handsomely on their collective skills and type-a work ethic. And until other spaces can similarly incentivize, the trend will continue.

Americans tend to be well educated but under-informed, because they fill the majority of their free time with trivial amusements. Most of the ones who seem to continue actively learning after college are just obsessing with a particular topic and ignoring most other things, whereas Europeans tend to be more generally interested in a variety of subjects outside of the ones they're the most familiar with. Politically Americans tend to learn just enough about an opposing point of view to justify believing that it's evil, whereas Europeans tend to understand the details of the opposition more.

After high school, 8 years later, I had a friend who was talking about D2 and how he was doing Ubers runs with some friends online. I was clueless and told him that I had no idea what he was talking about. He smiled, told me to find my CD keys and come over to his house with my computer that weekend.

He rushed me in around 30 minutes and my jaw hit the floor at how awesome that was. 10 minutes later, I was doing Baal for leveling, just to get my stats. My eyes lit up at the epicness that was going on. Within the hour, he got all of us doing Ubers, and I was screaming in joy at us glitching the skeleton resurrection in the west corner of Tristram.

And then I look over to his computer; he was taping down a fishing weight to his mouse for his hammerdin to constantly cast and left to go to the bathroom. I was so full of happiness that I dropped to the floor, laughing my ass off.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","YEah but you can't say luck doesn't play a part, it really does. And sometimes even two players playing at a perfectly same level, one can get 52% win rate and go up with time, and the other can unluckily get a 50% win rate, and go down in time. 

You can't have highest CS in the game when a nocturne goes 4-0 in 12 minutes and constantly ganks your lane. Not even an 1800 player can deal with that. You can't expect to win games where your teammates go 1-8 and 2-7 and you look at the stats and your teammates have only 30 or so ranked games, and your enemy team has in excess of 600 games in ranked each (but all same rating).

I don't need to prove my skills because I have done exceptionally well against high ranked players even in lane. I definitely am somewhat on the unlucky side lately. 

Consider this, when I first started ranked I went 13-2, and got up to 1600+. Then I slowly dropped to 1500. Did my game get worse? Not at all. I am way better than I was back then. I know way more about the game and little tricks. Considering elo inflation, I should have at least stayed 1600 if I didnt even improve. But that's not what happened.

The reality was I got lucky in my first 15 games, and then I got unlucky in the next 20 games, but I was able to keep 1500 for a while, because I improved my skills in the process. 

It's easy to sit at a throne as king and say that everything you did was because of you and that you yourself did everything correctly and got there. But from an objective view, becoming king can sometimes be a matter of luck, opportunity, knowing the right people, or killing the right person. The term 'being at the right place at the right time comes to mind.' I just happened to be in the wrong place and the wrong time a lot more than the inverse. 

I'm not saying I belong in high elo. But I know for certain, that I play better than a lot of 1500 and 1600 players.","1312159847"

But everyone is different, I (and my roommate who saw this last night) just don't like spectating sports and never have, but we discussed it and we both agree that we felt a lot of pressure through highschool to participate in this stuff.

Why would it have to be for christians then?

But yes, though not me, but I know for a fact that a friend was threatened to get shot at sight after he had implied that it was not a good thing for a certain christian woman to marry this atheist man. But umm, this is also anecdotal. Why are you asking us if we have been threatened, as if we told you we have, that is exactly what anecdotal evidence is.

But really. This guy who shot all those people recently in Norway, Breivik or something IIRC, is not a christian, but atheist, even though some news sources claim he is a christian.

In his book he clearly states that he likes the christian values in society, (he's anti-muslim) and that he is not a born-again and does not have a personal relationship with God. He claims to be christian, but not because he is religious at all, but because of cultural and other things. Clearly then, he also is of no any other kind of theist. 

In his own words: ""If you have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God then you are a religious Christian. Myself and many more like me do not necessarily have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and God. We do however believe in Christianity as a cultural, social, identity and moral platform. This makes us Christian (p. 1307).""

If I'm looking for a naturally darker wood, I would want a walnut or something more exotic, but its increased cost and my lower skill level might not warrant using such a valuable resource.  The solution would be to make it from poplar and birch plywood, stain it walnut, and call it functional.  
Perhaps if I possessed more skill in creating fine furniture, I would use nicer woods and natural finishes.  For the mid to average wood worker, less expensive woods with stains are a good way to hone skills and create functional pieces, while emulating the color of the characteristics of pricier species.","1312159896"

I have been told by a pair of religious females that they would kill and steal if they didn't believe in a god.

Even if this guild has a *focus* on PvE, the occasional Warzone or World PvP will probably happen because people enjoy that sort of thing. 

Some people don't like the PvP servers, hence there are reddit alternatives on PvE servers. Presumably the four guilds could grow quite big so communities for PvP and PvE could grow in all four of the alternatives. Now it's just up to you to choose server type and faction.

Yep. It's usually better to have two identical modules. However, if you really are on a budget, you could buy only one 1-GB module and keep the old 0.5-GB module.

&gt; what exactly is SiS chipset?

The northbridge chipset is the motherboard's main component. It connects the processor to everything else.

A few companies make NB chipsets: Intel, AMD, Nvidia, Via, and SiS. The first three are usually good; I don't really remember fondly of Via (I'm not even sure they're still in that business); SiS is the very low end -- cheap low-quality stuff.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","The reason battery devices **aren't** grounded is that household batteries cannot harm you. Think of when you hold a battery at either end. Technically you are making a circuit, but the electrical push (voltage) is too low to get by your fingers (it only likes nice conductive metal), so the electricity never enters you and it can't cause you harm. For reference:

AA or AAA battery: 1.5 Volts DC
Mains: 230 Volts AC (in UK), 110 Volts AC (in US)

As you can see the ""push"" from mains voltage is much higher, and can therefore run through your body which burns it. Also, DC power (from batteries) is much safer than AC power (from mains), because AC power  will stop your heart.

Thomas Edison though DC power was great for safety reasons, and used it as a reason to try and get everyone to use his DC system, but AC is much better for electricity that travels a long way, and it is easier to chance the voltage of an AC signal, which is why we have AC through our walls.","1312159963"

"SF4","t5_2r4cj","Respectfully disagree on both.  Ultras has been a hot topic since the game first came out, but I think the system makes sense.  If you have a meter-building system based on offense, then a person who is getting rushed down pretty much gets no meter while the aggressor only gets tools to make his assault even easier.  Or we end up with the whiffing normals for meter stuff that we saw in games like 3S.  Revenge meter/ultra ensures that you cannot lose the round without having access to your ultra.  If you are winning handily you arguably don't need it - and if you are losing its a nice tool to not only help close the gap, but to get the aggressor to back off.  Before AE, most ultras were designed with some degree of thought - sure if you were throwing out something big you'd get hit by random ultra, but in most cases the startup was enough so that random ultras simply didn't work.

Focus I think is a great system.  It lets you absorb a hit and potentially stun the opponent, but at the same time the focus itself is vulnerable to multi-hit attacks and armor breakers.  Plus, it guarantees that the player who does it will not be able to block for several frames.  There's quite a bit of risk/reward to it, which makes it an interesting and deep system.","1312159963"

From my perspective: you lied about something insignificant, and he over-reacted by breaking up with you. I could understand if he was confused and hurt, but just breaking up with you outright seems kind of overblown.

In any relationship, both partners need to work hard to make it run. This is doubly true in LDR's where you have the added stress of seeing each other very infrequently. To me, it seems like you are willing to put much more effort in then he is. I don't know what you can do to try and 'fix' things other than to keep a discussion open with him and see where it goes. Maybe he will come to realize he made a rash decision and will want to get back together. 

I don't think visiting him is a good idea. It seems like there's a good chance it wouldn't help anything- and unless you've got a lot of money I wouldn't risk $1,200.

"WeAreTheMusicMakers","t5_2qmah","It's a commentary on anthropocentric metaperception; that is, that our perception of perception is only concerned with the human experience and not the inhuman experience.  

Although the overtly sexual act is performed on an inorganic, inhuman recipient, the fellated machine emits an auditory positive feedback response, suggesting that it is aware of the act and communicating its pleasure.  It is not to suggest that the microphone is *literally* pleased; it is a metaphor for the emergence of metaperception as a key mechanism that facilitates positive feedback loops within organic networks.  

That is to say, what is perception (in this case, the perception of sexual pleasure) and why is our perception of perception so deeply rooted in our anthropocentric heritage?  Have we gone too far down the path of innovation without taking necessary care to analyze what it has taught us and to use its lessons to advance our societies in a way that is well-balanced and sustainable?  What will be the long-term societal ramifications of our human chauvinism?  

The device stands in contrast with the human; although it took tremendous amounts of time and energy to conceive of such an artificial device, the emergence of the feedback loop is exceptionally simple.  The complex nature of the device is in recognition of humanities achievements in the manipulation of environment and material, while the audience's inability to accept its feedback as an indicator of a perception of sexual pleasure is metaphorical of the inability of mainstream global human society to recognize our environment's perception of our actions and to heed its feedback.","1312159974"

In fact, I think one of the main problems with having the legal system in charge of regulating substances is that very few of them have any type of scientific background or thought process, so many are more wont to make their decisions based on intuition and inferential assumption regardless of whether the conclusions they draw are biologically or neurochemically accurate.","1312159987"

It sucks that people don't follow directions but that's why prescription drugs are exactly that - because people don't follow directions or bother to learn what the drugs are for. Interesting facts - when parents demand antibiotics for their children for no reason, only 30% actually finish giving the antibiotics to their children. Also, Southern Californians, wealthy families from Orange County are most likely to refuse childhood vaccinations, effectively causing the Pertussis outbreak in the area on their own. My point is that this ignorance appears in all socioeconomic groups. If you're going to deploy a powerful tool like DDT, you have to plan for all contingencies. 

Plus, follow your own advice and do your own research. It wasn't a few bald eagles - it harms birds and marine life, in addition to insects. It is also toxic to humans in ways that may not be immediately apparent. Some mosquito populations have now been found to be DDT resistant. Like antibiotic-resistance in bacteria, the reason for that is uncontrolled, widespread use of it. It's true that DDT use is attributed to eradicating malaria from many regions, but in some places that still have endemic malaria at present, DDT was never used because it was judged to be in effective due to environmental factors that would lead mosquitos to spawn continuously.","1312160000"

That's right. At small (that is, much less than `c`) velocities, multiplying your velocity by 50 as you did here produces a time dilation effect that is 2,500 times stronger. In your specific example, the dilation effect is only ~50 times stronger since you also divided the duration by 50 too. Some back-of-the-envelope math confirms that 50 * 500 = 25,000 microseconds is roughly equal to the 27 milliseconds you arrived at.","1312160014"

Actually it only took chu 2 months to become #1 LoL player on solo queue ladder. HoN has all components of LoL and even makes most of those components easier to use (besides summoner skills, which is easy to figure out) while LoL is lacking a LARGE number of core components to be successful in HoN.  

LoL is a simplification of DotA, HoN is a clone of DotA.

A HoN player will feel more comfortable and will be more comfortable transitioning to LoL simply because it's a simplification of the game they've been playing.

Lightning is indeed a form of plasma, the incredible amount of current flowing from sky to ground electrically charges the air it passes through, creating plasma (which is the bright glow you see immediately after the initial strike)

when i first started wearing makeup, i went to the makeup counter at a department store and had them show me which shades eyeshadow, blush, and lipstick looked best on me. i suggest you do this. i bought into the idea that their products were superior and thus bought them, but i suggest you don't. if you can't find a similar product at the drugstore (you probably can), then buy it, but only if you feel like you absolutely need it.

my advice is to spend the most money on your concealer and foundation, the reason being because it covers the majority of your face and is the most likely to irritate. generally in makeup, higher price = higher quality. that said, i'm not saying spend $50 on a jar of foundation, but around $15 perhaps at the drugstore.

my personal makeup essentials: foundation with spf, concealer, loose powder, neutral eyeshadow palette, bronzer/blusher, brown eyeliner and black mascara. i usually just wear lipgloss and chapstick on my lips. i find i don't need much more than this on a regular basis, but i do have some other lipsticks and shadows to mix it up.","1312160027"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I don't think I've ever told a rape joke, and I don't think I would in the future unless it was fucking hilarious. Not really a random joke type person. While I enjoy standup comedy very much and have studied the field myself. I wouldn't enjoy writing as a career. It really isn't a possibility. 

Theoretically though, I know my daughter, I have a personal interest in her well being. I know how she personally would react. It wouldn't be very favorable. Mostly because all of the other people in her life have made her focus on it so much that it has defined who she is. She's also that type of person any other male wouldn't want to be alone in a room with. Now, I'm not particularly excited about the path she walks in life. I see it as a rather sad, depressing life, filled with fear and hate. While I'm more of a happy go lucky type. Instead of moving forward in her life, others have enabled her and taught her to focus on the rape and to be a sad, hateful person. So mentally, she'll waste a good part of her life dealing with this challenge, to overcome these ideas that people like in this thread have ingrained in her. Instead of her being a happy, healthy individual who had a sorted past that people have helped her through and she's moved on, she's stuck in a loop. She will probably waste a large chunk of her life if not all of it trying to break free from these ideas and move on. 

She would be offended by a rape joke. She would probably throw a fit and run around all obnoxious. And you know why? Because she's an sad, unhappy, hateful person. This isn't the state I'd want to be in. This isn't the state I want her to be in. This isn't the state I'd want anyone to be in. But at the end of the day, they control how they feel. They control what they think. How they view life and what's important to them. A little self analysis and reflection, it's not like it's hard. Why run around being mad at shit that's suppose to be fun and humorous? Why do that? Why waste your time being a prick? Running around yelling at people cause you're mad at the world while the rest of us are having a good time. I've got no time for sad, angry people trying to make life suck cause they can't figure out it's easy. 

Fucked up shit happens to us all. No one wants fucked up shit to happen to themselves or other people. But it does. I'm not wasting my life coddling everyone. I'm too busy hanging out with fun, happy people. 

Given everything though, if I just happened to tell a rape joke and my daughter was there and got all offended. I would just look at her like she was a fool. Because at the end of the day, she is. I know why she is, and I know that eventually, hopefully, she'll grow out of it. Not to say that I don't go out of my way to nudge her in the right direction, but it's still up to her. ","1312160058"

The first is the ternary operator acting on a pair. The second abbreviates a pattern that comes up all the time in some code that I write where a substitution of values is predicated on a condition. ""If b then replace with function f, else leave unchanged."" Of course, this is just a matter taste.

I've only gigged twice with the Axe-FX - once direct, once with a cab. It definitely depends on the venue. Similar to you I often play in venues with bad PA's, so in those cases I'd prefer to keep it more within my control by using a power amp/cab. The time I played direct sounded a little weird through the foldback speakers as I hadn't really perfected the live tone (I should have cut some of the ultra high and low frequencies), but I was told that it still sounded awesome on the floor!

For amp/cab, I use a Rocktron Velocity 300 through a Mesa Boogie 4x12. It sounds awweeeesssooome. Definitely a more natural, punchy sound that I'm used to. 

I'd like to buy a proper FRFR monitor some time, though I'm not entirely sure what to get yet.","1312160059"

The EU may work OK for free trade, but as the last few years have shown, it's comically bad at united fiscal policy (Germany is on record saying they regret supporting the EU's formation) because there's no true central governing body with enough control to prevent massive fuck-ups by it's members. It would be greece all over again, but with NY, Texas and California bailing out Nebraska. Also, there's the issue of redundancy. We'd have 50 different central governments instead of 1, 50 different presidents instead of one. Remember all that geo-political influence we had back when we could have one executive formulate a single foreign policy? Gone. It would be a cacophony of bickering and contradiction.

When I was ~14 years old, we had a pool party in the back of our house with about 40 people in attendance (mostly adults that I did not know).  Our friendly neighbors were there though and, key to the story, the husband had a VERY similar name to his younger daughter of ~4 years old. The wife wanted to pull a joke on her husband and seeing that I had a stream machine in my hands, wanted me to go blast her husband with all kinds of psi.  To my eternal regret, my mind only heard the wife say the daughters name.  I was confused and asked, ""are you sure?"" a few times.  I ended up unloading an entire high pressure water gun on this poor little girl in front of all these people.  She fell to the ground and started howling in alarm, tears running down her face.

"starcraft","t5_2qpp6","There are no IPs stored in replays, therefore nothing that would help you with a DoS attack. I don't have *hard evidence* of this because it's much harder to show evidence that something isn't there. But you will certainly not see any evidence of IPs being pulled from replays.

Being able to derive a character code from a replay is no reason not to release them after the tournament, as you can find character codes through brute force anyway, so replays would only expediate that process. Even *if* IPs could be pulled, these would be IPs that would never be used by those players or MLG again, so there is still no reason not to release the replays after the event.

So most likely this comes down to one or both of these reasons:

1) Pressure from Gom &amp; the Koreans to adopt their no replay policy to maintain some secrecy for player strategy &amp; tactics

2) MLG is selling the replays to Youtube casters


Either way, MLG is lying to us.

Torrent speeds vary, but don't often go below 30kb/s, and if they're in the cache they'll run at line speed.  
  
The cache is basically a bunch of commonly used content, mostly YouTube and torrents, which is stored locally in nz and so loads very fast. They also have a stem content server, so most steam games download and update really fast.

"books","t5_2qh4i","Faulkner is one of my favorite authors.  I find some of his stuff very readable (even funny, not to say slapstick), but in some stories Faulkner abandons straightforward narrative, consistent viewpoint, reliable narrator, and even punctuation.  IMO that's just a great writer experimenting (mutilating?) the medium; the books are worth reading, if you can stand it.

Oh well, here's my classification list:

* 
Easy reads, or worth figuring out:

Soldiers' Pay, Mosquitoes, Sartoris, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, The Unvanquished, The Hamlet, The Town, The Mansion, The Reivers, A Fable, Sanctuary.

* 
More difficult, mostly because of Faulkner's use of stream-of-consciousness or nonlinear time:

Absalom, Absalom!, Intruder in the Dust, The Wild Palms, and The Sound and the Fury.  In The Sound and the Fury the challenge is to understand Benjy's story:  he's very retarded, doesn't understand much, and doesn't explain anything.  But once you get used to him the whole book is excellent.

The line between this and magic is incredibly thin, though. Things like teleportation of objects with non-zero mass and FTL travel are tantamount to sorcery, aren't they? They're about as likely as being able to cast spells, or psychic powers. All of that may -- *may* -- be possible with some kind of incredibly exotic technology that would be roughly as advanced as FTL travel. 

But of course, ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" So I suppose the only real way to distinguish the genre is by the types of clothes they wear and the supposed time period. If it's in the future and they're in spandex, it's sci-fi. If it's in the past and they have loose robes and pointy hats, it's fantasy.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Double shift: go during your lunch break.

You may as well have said ""go on your bathroom break."" This implies that you work close enough to a polling center to get there and back in time in the first place, and that you don't live in an area where it takes more than a few minutes to vote. For millions of people, this is not the case. So; your solution is no ""solution"" at all; only a hypothetical.

&gt;No car: call a friend or bike.

Which places the assumption that you *must* have a friend who has a vehicle who can work around your schedule to take you there, or have a bike. The whole point of this is to remove the requirement of special situations/assumptions about peoples' situations from their ability to vote, which you fail to grasp. Not everyone has immediate family or friends who are able to help when necessary. I'm not sure why you picked those suggestions instead of the much less personal-circumstance dependent options such as public transport or calling volunteer organizations whose intent is to drive people to the polls, but even then, not all cities have reliable, timely public transport in all areas, and volunteer organizations are often undermanned. It's really the latter that I think should be bolstered.

&gt;Physically intimidated: its illegal, call the police.

What are they going to do? Hear a he-said-she-said argument, say ""keep it civil,"" and leave without doing anything of note. In many cases, this doesn't involve any one person making threats, but an atmosphere unattributable to any specific person or group. I'm talking about *realistic* options, not basic argumentative ones that ignore practical reality.

&gt;Absentee ballot: geez put it in the mail. 

You missed my incredibly obvious point. *Absentee voting laws vary state by state*. You first have to live in a state that allows absentee voting in the first place. Then, you likely have to live in one which specifically requires you to have a justifiable excuse for voting absentee, such as being deployed in the military or living overseas. The problem is that access to it mail-in voting is not universal, which, though having more potential issues with tampering/uncounted votes, would at least reduce/nullify transportation and time issues for millions more people. Just a question, do you live in the US? I'm starting to think you don't.

&gt;If they lose it your vote probably wasn't the one that was going to change the election anyways. 

You're an idiot.

&gt;People with disabilities are allowed to vote as far as I know. 

Uh, what? I'm talking people with handicaps which in any way impede their ability to get from their place of residence, vote, and return. I have no clue why you think their *right* to vote is in question.

&gt;I would be for government passive assistance to increase the ease of voting, I am not for government actively trying to get people who don't put the least bit of effort into voting.""

So, to put it another way, you would be for government initiatives which *remove barricades that prevent people from taking part in the democratic process*. Which, if you'll look up, was a main point of my original post, which you decided to argue against - then agree to.

Again, you're an idiot.","1312160110"
"gaming","t5_2qh03","[Here's a pretty solid faq for making a good character](http://www.gamefaqs.com/pc/924363-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/faqs/42063). If you cntrl-f ""class template,"" there's some decent builds to mess around with.

The general idea is only specialize in one combat type-- don't pick both blade/blunt or light/heavy armor. Also, don't pick something like acrobatics or athletics as a major skill. It'll level up way too fast and your level ups will have terrible stat bonuses. 

I'm not sure if you're familiar with how the level system works but when you level up a skill through repetition, the appropriate stat will receive a bonus when you level up. For instance, if you level up destruction, when you level up there will be a bonus to your willpower.


So, if you level up only using destruction, restoration, and alteration spells, when you level up your willpower will have a +5 bonus and everything else will be at +1 and your character will end up sucking a lot.

We, and many other craft breweries use whats called a DE filter. without getting into the specifics of how it works, we ferment, transfer to secondary, then filter our beer through a filter bed that works similar to a charcoal filter. after that it goes into the brite tank (BBT). the BBT is outfitted with a carbonation stone, which has a co2 line connected and carbs the beer. That is then sent under pressure to the filler.

The filler rinses, sanitises and purges the bottles with co2. This purging is the most important part of bottle shelf life. The beer in then injected under pressure to the bottle. pressure is released and the beer passes a fobber, which injects a tiny amount of water at high pressure to make the beer foam. we cap on the foam to eliminate any and all o2 in the bottle. from there its rinsed, dried, labeled and put in the box.

bigger breweries use centrifuges and even plate filters.

tl;dr all sediment is eliminated at filtering before hitting the BBT. it is carbd in the BBT. beer is under pressure from the end of fermentation onward. ","1312160133"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","But the *political* cultures are entirely different.  Look at a political map, just to see the red/blue divide.  The states have different priorities because the people, by and large, have different priorities.  Let's face it: The North is more liberal than the South.  People in the South tend to appreciate smaller government than people in the North.  This is not a little thing.  It's a fundamental philosophy of government, specifically how the governed want to be .. governed.  Government should adhere to the people's will on this, as authority to govern is derived exclusive from consent of the governed, and a large powerful federal government can't do this in the US, because the regions are different in this fundamental regard.

With a strong federal government, you can't cater to the political philosophy of small government.  With a weak federal government, you can: because those states can have larger (state) governments with more services and higher taxes.  Those (red) states that don't want that, don't have to.  But with this large government idea at the federal level, there is no choice.","1312160135"

It's this fucking roller coaster of terribleness in those early months...

But

Today, for the first time in her little life, she was upset and crying real hard and the *only* person in the world she wanted was me. I even won out over mommy's boobs. Those moments, when you're the only thing in her world that matters in that second, are mind-blowing.

Today isn't the first time something she's done has taken me aback, but it's just the example freshest in my mind.

The ups and downs that first year are insane. At 10 months I feel like I'm starting to see a light at the end of the inconsistent tunnel, but somehow, every time I start to feel the most frustrated, she does something that makes it better.

Right now just do your best to abide. It takes a little time for the father to really get attached. But it'll happen soon and you won't even think about all that frustration you're feeling right now.","1312160191"

They make more money when their customers don't suffer from misfortune. Which is why they'll give discounts or incentives to things that lower risk (example: having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen may lower your homeowner's premium).

no you misunderstand me, I mean that the very act of being *for profit* is profiting from misfortune, it's immoral to be for profit when the service you provide involves helping suffering people. 

&gt;I don't think you fully understand how insurance companies work.

I have no idea why you think that. Take health insurance, a capitalist, for profit system like our own in which the bourgeoisie has a *legal* obligation to his shareholders to increase profit, contains incentives for that bourgeoisie *not* to pay out health insurance claims. 

A health insurance union has incentives to not only pay out claims, but to get the best possible care and value for their members. ","1312160192"

If you base your world view on googling things you miss a lot. I was in europe for kosovo and we were 3 weeks into a full on shooting war while CNN still said we would ""consider action"" if you travel overseas you will see that the media we get here is no different than soviet era pravda. In germany we would watch the US CNN feed and the german CNN feed side by side delivering opposite stories.

As to obama's performance, I do not expect rainbow pooping unicorns. But when  a man says he will ""not sign any bill that has not been available for public viewing for five days"" then signs the healthcare bill before we got to read it, I feel burned. He has the power, the right and the obligation to not sign things he says he will not sign. He could have defunded the wars by not picking up a pen. Nobody has a gun to his head forcing him to sign a bill and to say he sold us out for ""political reasons"" or to be re-elected does not cut it. If he had honor he would have kept his promises at the expense of his second term.

What about the warrantless wiretapping, he said he would put a stop to it and then assembled a legal team, including bush-era cronies to fight for more wiretapping, using the same legal defense bush used and he (rightly) called ""unacceptable""

Wifi signals are susceptible to quite a bit of interference such as wall insulation, microwaves, running water and so on. A wireless repeater might do the trick, but it would also be picking up the weak signal and rebroadcasting it. If the rooms that your router and iMac are in share the same circuit you might want to check out powerline ethernet adapters. They are relatively cheap and a great alternative for desktop computers instead of relying on a wireless signal.

What I did was LOTS of research on certain companies and LOTS of self educating on how the market works and what everything means. I think you need to educate yourself more on the market first. 

I looked for a stock with a low P/E  and something that was on the rise from its 08 drop.

Then when I was able to get a job I took that money and bought different stocks and continued growing my portfolio.

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","&gt;I'm not sure how an insurance company does this. Ideally the company would love to never pay claims. Claims == money going out of the company. They make more money when their customers don't suffer from misfortune. Which is why they'll give discounts or incentives to things that lower risk (example: having a fire extinguisher in the kitchen may lower your homeowner's premium).

no you misunderstand me, I mean that the very act of being *for profit* is profiting from misfortune, it's immoral to be for profit when the service you provide involves helping suffering people. 

&gt;I don't think you fully understand how insurance companies work.

I have no idea why you think that. Take health insurance, a capitalist, for profit system like our own in which the bourgeoisie has a *legal* obligation to his shareholders to increase profit, contains incentives for that bourgeoisie *not* to pay out health insurance claims. 

A health insurance union has incentives to not only pay out claims, but to get the best possible care and value for their members. ","1312160213"

"UTAustin","t5_2qy08","I lived in The Quad (3 honors halls: Andrews, Blanton, and Carothers, as well as non-honors all-girl Littlefield, which is its own entity but completes the physical ""quad"" of 4 buildings) and was President of the Residence Hall Council for ABC my second year, so I dealt a lot with those buildings as well as the others. 


I would recommend putting the Honors residence halls as your first choice, because they do put non-Honors students in there when there is space. My roommate was non Honors.


The bonuses for the Quad are: studious residents who (usually) care about school, but love to party and have a good time. 

Moveable furniture: Only a few dorms have moveable furniture, which may or may not be important to you. We wanted the freedom because it allowed us to bunk our beds and use the extra space for a sweet couch/tv/fridge area.

proximity to ""Kins"": Kinsolving is one of two dining halls on campus, and the Quad is right across the street so it is super easy to grab some food. And there are study/tutor groups that meet there as well, so you would be close to those.

close to the Drag: Guadalupe street is just one street west of the Quad, so non-cafeteria food is super close, as is West Campus if you: like to party/are going Greek/have friends off campus.

The ""Quad"": so the actual rectangle made by the 3 Honors buildings + Littlefield is a nice, usually grassy area complete with picnic tables, trees, and usually has people in it lounging around, enjoying the sun, meeting for homework groups, etc.

The ""Q"": a little basement room underneath Andrews that is a popular hang out space as well. When I was Prez, they said it would get remodeled soon, but I haven't been back to see if that is true.


alrighty, enough about that. 

I worked with the Presidents and Hall Councils from all the other dorms, so I've heard good and bad about them too. Let me know if you have any more questions! And welcome to UT!!!!","1312160217"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","If you excite a molecule that can fluoresce, it always emits at a lower energy (longer wavelength) than you excited it.  The rest of the energy is dissipated as heat.  So basically you got that part spot-on.  

The explanation for what's going on, though, I think is less cool.  The green laser pointer actually doesn't have a green laser in it.  It has an IR laser that emits at 1064 nm or thereabouts.  It then has what's called a doubling crystal that takes two 1064 nm photons, combines them, and releases a 532 nm photon.  Now to do this you need lots of photon flux, because you have to have two photons hit the same spot on the crystal within a very short time scale - think femto-, maybe picoseconds.  

Ok, that's cool, but what does that have to do with anything?  Well, the 1064 nm laser is pretty cheap so it doesn't just put out one wavelength.  All lasers, in fact, put out a band of wavelengths with some width and the maker just reports the peak or center wavelength.  Depending on the laser there can be other lines, too, in addition to the main one.  So I'm guessing that your laser pointer puts out 1064 nm light mostly, but probably a bit of 1200 nm or so, too.  All of this gets doubled to 532 nm plus some 550 nm (yellow).  You don't see the yellow unless you do something to subtract the much more intense green light, like shine the laser pointer onto or through something that happens to absorb green and not yellow light.  

You could check this if you ever had access to a lab with optical filters or a spectrograph.  ","1312160226"

The USA has _plenty_ of ""struggles"" with Free Speech. From Cornstock Laws, to many other statutes banning obscenity - laws wich are _still in force_, by the way, to [banning the Communist party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_Control_Act), a [long](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_and_Sedition_Acts) sordid [history](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedition_Act_of_1918) of [other](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subversive_Activities_Control_Act) sedition laws, some of which are _also_ still on the books and to various extents, in force, to the [Communications Decency Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Decency_Act) of the 1990's, and dozens of [anti-flag-burning laws](http://civilliberty.about.com/od/freespeech/p/flagburning.htm) which are on the books. (and remained in force until [1989](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_v._Johnson))

The difference is that other countries are not common-law systems, and so have _their_ exemptions written down as laws. In the United States, it is down to the interpretation of an un-elected body: The Supreme Court. And that ""almost complete free speech"" which is ""ENSHRINED"" in such ""clear words"" by the constitution has been given _dramatically_ different interpretations by that body at various times, which at their most extreme went far beyond what most modern democracies have today. 

The current, liberal laws on Free Speech is **not** something which has always existed, and is not due to any change of laws, but entirely due to the relatively-liberal makeup of the Supreme Court after 1960. With a near-even split in its current makeup, and existing conservative justicies (e.g. Scalia) having voiced quite less liberal definitions of 'obscenity', the US is in effect one or two SCOTUS appointments away from much more limited freedom of speech, with no changes to the 'enshrined' text.

And it's not as if the legislative branch is much better. In fact it's worse, as it continues to pass laws that are subsequently struck down by the SCOTUS for violating the first amendment (by their current interpretation). Not to mention that every Congress for the last 15 years, except for the last, has passed an [anti-flag-burning amendment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_Desecration_Amendment) to the Constitution. 

It's self-righteous nonsense to think that the US doesn't have ""struggles"" or limits to its Free Speech, or that the US Constitution guarantees Free Speech in its current form, or that the American people or American lawmakers have much more respect for Freedom of Speech than other nations. That's simplified ""patriotic"" BS they teach schoolkids. The reason the US has as liberal freedom of speech as it does, is due to the interpretations of the Constitution made by the SCOTUS over the last 50 years, and the simple fact that Congress _cannot_ pass any law to change those verdicts, short of an Amendment. Given that that has been attempted many times, it says more about the how difficult it is to amend the Constitution that it does about the respect for Free Speech among US politicians.

I think this [article](http://pandasthumb.org/archives/2009/01/complete-ntal-mtdna.html) puts it pretty well:

&gt;Now that we have a complete Neandertal mtDNA genome, the distinction between the Neandertal and modern human mtDNA is even more striking. It strengthens the view that Neandertals should be designated a separate species Homo neanderthalensis, because even if they could interbreed with the ancestors of modern humans (and they probably could, and possibly did on occasion 3) there does not seem to have been a significant amount of genetic interflow happening between the two populations. We don’t find Neandertal mtDNA in modern humans, and vice versa. Humans and Neandertals seem to have split off around 600,000 years ago and developed separately thereafter.

Interestingly enough, in the article NoTimeForInfinity posted, the Neanderthal genes are found on the X chromosome... so does that suggest the crossbreeding was male Neanderthal to female H. sapiens only?","1312160260"

His current study has moved memantine beyond rats and into humans.

Also, he thinks research is underfunded.

"nosleep","t5_2rm4d","A. They *should* be given equal weight. This subreddit is for stories, not just fact and not just fiction. Each story should be judged by its ability to scare. Things can be scary for some people even when they are clearly fictional. Go ahead and ask questions if the story is passed off in such a way as to make you think it's real... it's not like anybody is under any obligation to answer you.

B. Nobody expects things to never be questioned, they expect people to not ruin the possibility of truth for others. If it's blatant, obvious fiction, there's no f-ing need to spell it out for everyone else, doing so makes you look like an ass. If it seems honest, but you don't buy it, keep it to yourself. What do you get out of ruining the story for others? 99% of the stories I've read in my life that had a lasting horror effect on me were fiction.

C. Just because some people play along and react as if everything is real, no matter how obvious it is, does *not* mean that they expect you to as well. Nobody expects you to take anything as fact. What they expect is that if you don't take something as fact, shut up about it. If I find something totally unbelievable and not scary, I downvote it. What I don't do is then go in and post about how obvious it was to me that the story was fake. That's what's known as a ""dick move"".

D. People aren't afraid true tags cast their stories into doubt, they're annoyed that the true tag is basically circumventing the ""everything is true"" rule by implying everything else is fake. There's absolutely NO NEED to tag your story as true. Hell, I could tag a fictional story as true and start it off ""I'm a skeptic but this is 100% true..."" so what's the point? You may as well post in the Smurf fanfiction forum and start everything off with ""This is Smurf fanfiction"" and put a tag in the title ""[SMURF FANFICTION]"". OF COURSE IT IS. EVERYTHING IN THERE IS. Just like everything here is true, in that if you don't believe it, have the courtesy to not try to ruin the mood for everyone else.","1312160276"

The next tire shop refused as well. This was a very expensive tire for my Jeep Rubicon, a Goodyear MTR tire with only 10k miles. I told the young man behind the counter to put in a tube. He said that it could not be done. The old fart in the back told the kid to order a tube for my radial tire. They plugged and patched the tire, then installed the tube, for $25. A lot cheaper than $180 for a new tire. Besides, I like to keep the tire diameters equal on the same axle due to the air lockers that the Rubicon has and the limited-slip in the rear.

Long story short: You can put a tube in a radial tire to salvage it especially if you don't plan on high-speed driving.

I would suggest searching for how to replace the mixer for your shower controls.  Total cost for me was 90 dollars to have a perfectly working shower again. 

Basically what was happening to me was that I would adjust the temp to a sane level and then the little stone would end up shifting blocking off one of the valves forcing the water through one valve.  This would result in either hot or cold finding its way through vs. being mixed like it was supposed to be.  GL, hope you fix it, I am very happy I did.

This is particularly challenging in Java-based environments because you absolutely cannot have garbage collections.  One must delicately balance message size with encoding/decoding costs.

There's also plenty of interesting work on the UI side, and the challenges there are quite different.  You give up the realtime requirement because realtime data is useless to humans, but you instead must be able to collect, aggregate, and visualize *tons* of data very quickly.

There is nothing ""mindless"" or ""soulless"" about the work we do.  And while many HFT programmers are fascinated by the business side, some of us are quite content to focus on the programming side.  You need not be interested in finance to enjoy the work.","1312160317"

It's expression, though admittedly a poor one. Perhaps I should have said ""the exception to the rule"", but regardless of my word choice, the point is that an *individual* case does not invalid a *general* rule. Pointing out the existence of one or even a couple extremely talented white basketball players doesn't prove that whites are as good at the sport as blacks.

&gt;Basketball is the national sport of Lithuania, and they're really good at it, too!

Your argument fails for a couple reasons: First of all, I never claimed that whites weren't good at basketball, only that blacks were better. Secondly, the population of Lithuania is almost exclusively white, but if they had a larger black population, I imagine that their basketball teams would be predominately black. Attempting to refute my argument by bringing up these points is like using the existence of the WNBA to disprove the notion that men are better at basketball than women. Obviously, women are capable of playing basketball, and some of them are even very good at it, but if the league allowed both genders to play, men would probably take over.

Having said all that, this conversation is going off track, and neither one of us is likely to make any headway with the other because your definition of ""racism"" includes believing blacks are better at basketball, and I think your definition sucks. All we can do now is argue over this point, and I don't have any desire to waste my time with such a fruitless discussion.","1312160320"

It's one of those instances where people sort of shape their expectations according to the mainstream hetero culture. Since, statistically, the roles—in terms of who sticks it to whom in hetero relationships are determined by the sex of the partners and the general population is evenly divided between the sexes I think many expect the same pattern to apply to gay relationships. 

In parts of the developing world, such as South America and the Middle East where there is a severe stigma towards assuming the ""female"" role during sex, the numbers are much more similar but in more open cultures bottoms become the majority, by far.

I've always had this vague feeling that Father Nature intended for gay male society to function like our cousins', the gorillas: one dominant male with a bunch of sexy bitches to suck his cock and cook his food. Heh.

"islam","t5_2qhbp","The largest Muslim country by population, Indonesia, *never* had a Muslim army invade. While there was some role of military conquest in the spread of Islam, it could be argued that it was less of a factor than in the spread of Christianity.

As far as homosexuality is concerned, the range of opinion is as wide under Islam as it is under Christianity.  The Muslim mayor of Calgary, Canada, just lead the Gay Pride parade there.  [Here](http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/03/27/islam-039recognizes-homosexuality039.html) is a report from an Islamic conference on homosexuality.  The [Heartland Proclamation](http://brucescommentaria.blogspot.com/2011/06/heartland-proclamation.html) is one of an increasing number of statements on this subject from the Christian community.

What I do view as a measure of success is some day being able to provide for my family and for my children to never have to worry about money like I did growing up. With only a G.E.D., going to college is one of the few ways for me to accomplish that. 

Also, as a first generation college student, coming home with a degree is viewed as a success in my book because it shows to my younger siblings that they can do it too and hopefully some day as a family we will not have to be ""working poor"". 

I'm completely aware that all of this are self-imposed mental constructs, but growing up in a family where success was measured far differently I know that getting a degree isn't going to be the only way I will be successful in life.

He always says he will pay me back or get me something, I even let him know it was my Bday and I could *really* enjoy a pizza. That didn't happen.

True I don't know his situation, but he and his girlfriend both have jobs and live together, I was (and still am) unemployed getting $225 a week. I don't know where all his money goes, but if he can afford netflix and MW2 which he never had until after I got him the gold sub, then he could do something nice for me. $25 for the pizza, $13 for shipping him my brand new but never used headset (add $20 for the cost of the headset but I don't care about that) and $35 for the gold.

The fact the all of the states share the same interests, in my opinion, allows small groups (read: tea party) to exercise power disproportionate to their electoral base because of the ridiculous influence they have in swaying the Republican party's policies. Similar to how small fringe groups exercise a ton of power in parliamentary governments, since they're incredibly important in forming coalitions.

Anarchism is about no rulers.  This does not mean a group of people cannot organize together and agree to follow a set of rules.  So long as those rules are always open to change when the loose support and everyone has an equal opportunity to enforce them or dissent from them, rules do not necessarily imply: ""one possessing or held to possess supreme political power or sovereignty"" (that is to say, rulers).","1312160397"

Also, like I said, you can't standardise height/weight expectations ESPECIALLY in children with an illness as devastating as intractable epilepsy. Current methods are based on an estimate using the height of both parents and then modifying for sex. At the very best it's a guess of what MIGHT happen and the conditions for growth with epilepsy are far from ideal and normal. To the best of my knowledge there has never been a study done on children who do not have epilepsy that are on the diet and I haven't seen a comparison study of growth pattern in children who have epilepsy who are not using the Ketogenic Diet to treat their intractable epilepsy.

Indeed, both our unions are under heavy weather.

Your union started out by pushing off against a perceived common enemy (The British). From the start of your union, there was a feeling if togetherness, of making things happen in the new world, of *excitement*. 

Our union was started by government bureaucrats pressurized by big business. From Heraklion to Tromso, if you ask the common persons opinion, you will most likely receive a heartily  felt ""Fuck Europe"" for your trouble. Yours is a country, and Europe is not.

Where you say that some of your problems stem from adopting European policies, I must disagree. Look at Scandinavia, Germany and to a lesser extent my country (the Dutchlands). People living in these countries enjoy a high standard of living. They are not being evicted, they do have steady jobs, and when they suspect something is wrong with their body the go and consult a doctor without any care of financial consequence.

Also, probably superfluous as you appear to be well informed: the word ""liberal"" in the political sense means different things in the US and in Europe. Our liberal parties are comparable to your republican party but without the craziness or the religion. Your use of ""liberal"" would probably match most of our socialist democrat parties (which are not really socialist at all but in name. They are firmly anchored one notch and not more than that to the left of our liberals).

I agree that the internet broadens our knowledge, that's impossible to argue against. But since I am most likely a bit older than you, I have significant experience with libraries, and I can tell you that you're quite wrong. The issue is actually speaking to one of the librarians for help. Most are quite interested in the work that they do, and will happily shoot the shit about books for longer than their manager would probably like, that's part of their job. For that matter, most of the books that I've read have been recommended by either librarians or close friends. The textbooks that I select have been suggested (or required) by professors and so I know what to look for. You don't have to know every book, just as you don't (and can't) know ever internet source.

I agree that the internet is useful. It is what allows me to work in computer science. I'd have never learned to install that first CD burner or fix my first Windows 98 errors without it. I'm simply saying that books are still a better source for real and in-depth information, unless you're subscribed to the peer-reviewed repositories.

"treecomics","t5_2rxh8","&gt;In fact, I think one of the main problems with having the legal system in charge of regulating substances is that very few of them have any type of scientific background or thought process

Completely agree. I've seen judges go off on people in court over marijuana. We have a well known judge who goes apeshit over marijuana cases. He is a real asshat and clown when it comes to knowing any science behind marijuana and it's interaction with the brain.

The main problem for law enforcement however is that it is absurdly hard to test for marijuana levels of intoxication. I am [somewhat] sure there isn't a way to accurate measure the level of intoxication in any real hard and fast way. The law requires you to apply it evenly, and avoid picking and choosing.

Imagine for a moment marijuana was to be legalized. They would have to find a way to stop people from driving under it's influence, because no matter how much mr. 6-years wants to talk, it's completely impossible to measure in any real hard way [as of now]. So in reality the argument, without that tool, becomes 'is it ok to drive under the influence of marijuana?'.

If there was a hard way to measure it, we could absolutely find gradations. To think that someone who smoked four hours ago is anywhere near the level of the guy who just smoked an ounce ten minutes ago is absurd. I want that tool, because it would go a long way to helping make the argument of law enforcement being possible under legalization.

Seriously, need I remind everyone that I'm not here to ban marijuana, or ban smoking, or ban anything. I'm just asking for limits and responsibility, and for people to be realistic.

Also I drove once high and it was fucking terrifying. On nothing else alone I would never do it again. Worst highway experience **ever**

As to studies, there's really no point in ever picking and choosing from scientific studies. If I wanted to, I could find studies supporting and both hurting my position. It's up for people to make rational opinions based on evidence. Rather than yanking one study out, I refer to http://goo.gl/cvJ1b for completeness.","1312160427"

Should r/politics readers and posters try their best to represent all opinions? probably. Are they going to? probably not. If you're looking for how certain events are going to affect certain politicians and segments of the population, you have to take the bias you get from a political organization (loosely used)... like a politics message board. 

If you're looking for what happened, go to a news source. The reddit equivalent is r/news.

"birdpics","t5_2r2m9","I'm pretty sure that's actually a Ferruginous Hawk, based on the following:

1. The toes are relatively short and thick -- this is a trait of Buteos (like Ferruginous hawks), not Accipiters (incl. Cooper's hawks).
2. Cooper's hawks, like all Accipiters, have yellow or orange eyes as juvenile which change to red in adults -- the photo looks like it *could* maybe be a juvenile eye color under weird lighting, except that...
3. Juvenile Cooper's hawks generally have a greyish to pale yellow cere (the fleshy bit at the base of the beak), and this one's cere is very yellow.

I'm just guessing all this from a single photo, though, so I may well be wrong.

If it *is* a Ferruginous hawk and not a Cooper's, that's good news. Cooper's hawks do notoriously badly in rehab and especially captivity situations. If it turns out to be an unreleasable Cooper's hawk, there's a vanishingly thin chance that it will be found suitable for captivity.","1312160455"

To test the inner ear, among other things, I laid on my side, and a small device was placed in my exposed ear. Diodes or sensors were places around my eyes to detect their movement. Then, the doctor turns on a machine that pumps air through the device in my ear, causing it to sound like a tornado to me. After about 3 seconds, my eyes began to involuntarily move left and right as a reaction to the swirling air sound. After a minute or so I began to feel really dizzy and somewhat sick, but the test stopped soon afterward. Both ears were tested. Turns out that they measure eye movement in relation to the air noise to check for hearing or balance impairments (if you know more about this, correct me if I'm wrong, I had this test done many years ago). I had a slight impairment in one ear, but nothing major. This test has always been really interesting to me, I wish more people had the chance to experience it and see what it's like. ","1312160494"

The meching player complicates drop play by having lots of turrets, sensor towers and viking superiority. Most drops you do are suicide missions, and even if you do manage to kill production facilities or workers or whatever you still have to deal with the strong positional push of a mech army. The way you win with marauders vs mech is to pick off tanks constantly, snipe newer expansions and deny him from pushing on to your half of the map. This is MUCH harder to execute at a high level than simply making turrets/viking/raven/tank and zoning your opponent off from the rest of the map.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","OP:

&gt; Can someone explain to me what would happen to your consciousness if you stepped into a teleportation device? 

You earlier:

&gt; your consciousness would persist. Contrary to what some skeptics are saying here, we can say this with a lot of accuracy.

You now:

&gt; I didn't say anything about them being the same person or not. I simply stated that they would have an exactly similar consciousness.

""Exactly similar consciousness"" and ""your consciousness"" sound distinct to me.  The former seems to imply qualitative identity.  The latter seems to imply numerical identity.

&gt; This 'criterion' is completely circular.  Given your definition of the self, you are effectively saying 'You are the same person over time iff you are the same person'.

It isn't a naturalized account of personal identity.  *Nobody* has that.  It's a criterion of personal identity -- namely a conceptual analysis of what personal identity consists in.  If you agree that my proposal reduces to that tautology, then it sounds like you agree with my criterion.

&gt; This might sound counterintuitive to you, but I do not believe that it has to be true that I will be one of the two resulting persons. I do not believe that this has to be true because I do not believe that personal identity should always be determinate, and also because I do not believe that it fundamentally matters in cases like this one. In fact I believe that problems like this one show that we shouldn't always think about situations like this one in terms of personal identity. It is too much of an all-or-nothing concept.

And your beliefs sound reasonable to me.  But they are just one set of beliefs amongst many, none of which seem to have knockdown arguments for them.  Thus you might want to revise your earlier assertion that we can say with a high degree of accuracy what happens to conscious minds in teleportation cases.","1312160499"

A moral panic was created about child pornography and protecting children from kidnapping by strangers, but NOT about protecting children from parents and family 'friends', who are 9 times more likely (no, I did not make it up, 90% of child rape is done by someone close to the child, either family or family friend).  Why?  Because such a moral panic is the perfect cover for eroding rights.  And who are the only people who would ever dare stand against this?  Well, if you oppose this bill, then CLEARLY you must be a child molester.  Worse thing is most people out there are going to fall for the whole ploy.

In the same vein, when your football stadium raises the price for a ticket you don't burn down the stadium, because if you do not only can you get arrested, but theres nowhere to go watch the football.

Being a child throwing a fit and breaking things simply because you aren't happy is a completely illogical way to deal with a problem, which is why children do these things and adults don't. Just because you are anonymous on the internet doesn't mean you need to lack common sense.

**TL;DR? Don't incite illegal shit that ruins the game more just because you are having a tantrum, you asshat**

I think if the situation had become like that at Silverstone where the race was coming to a close we might have saw something a bit different. Likewise, had the redbulls been battling for position like Hamilton and Button I think that would have been OK with Horner.

A lot of teams will let the cars outright race up until the last pitstop/last few laps. Great race today, just wish Lewis had some better luck.","1312160520"

Everything is so much easier on linux, imagine, having 20k+ world class applications ready to install with just one single command, that's what I call ease of use.

Using linux, you'll also have access to some of the brightest people in the world ready to help you over IRC if you ever run into some trouble you can't just google your way out of. But then again, most solutions are posted openly in forums an wikis, so you _can_ just google them and 95% of the time, the solutions suggested actually work.

Linux is a very mature OS, absolutely ready for anyone who wants to get lean and start using their machine like it was supposed to be used. 

I honestly believe that if you put a completely new user, who has never seen a computer before, in front of linux, it would be just as hard/easy for them to learn linux as it would be for them to learn windows.

Sure though, compiling a kernel may be difficult, but there's absolutely no reason why you would ever have to do it. Compiling your own kernel is about as relevant for the average linux user as disassembling and reassembling the engine is for the typical driver/car owner.","1312160526"

People of any ethnicity can have the upper lid drooping (blepharoptosis) to the level of the pupil or below.  Although this typically does not affect their visual acuity, it does limit their superior visual field.

In Europe, there are a number of competitions. Unlike the US where each league has a regular season and then playoffs, European Leagues have several separate competitions. England has the Premier League (the regular season), FA Cup, League Cup (For the higher league; think of MLB-AAA-AA in one competition and AdvA-A-ShortA in another), and the Continental Competitions in which teams from all over the continent play in (Champions League for the very best, Europa League for the next tier). It is possible to play in three or four competitions every year and possible to win them all, but that is difficult.

One thing to do is to read a little about each team and see if you like the history or culture behind them. Arsenal and Tottenham are the North London teams - traditionally a mixed area in socioeconomic status - but both have different histories of tactics. Arsenal were a stereotypically boring defensive side until recent years, while Tottenham has a legacy of attacking football. Liverpool became a club following a dispute between a landowner in the city and the other team in the city, Everton. Some rivalries have big political and social implications, like Rangers-Celtic and Real Madrid-Barcelona. Things like that. Look for those.

&gt;Overall, it is possible to conclude that cannabis has a measurable effect on psychomotor performance, particularly tracking ability.

Yes, which they then go on to say:

&gt;Its effect on higher cognitive functions, for example divided attention tasks associated with driving, appear not to be as critical.

The impairment of higher cognitive functions are what makes driving drunk so dangerous:

&gt;the severe effects of alcohol on the higher cognitive processes of driving are likely to make this more of a hazard, particularly at higher blood alcohol levels.

Next...

&gt;In terms of road safety, it cannot be concluded that driving under the influence of cannabis is not a hazard

here is the rest of that quote:

&gt; as the effects of various aspects of driver performance are unpredictable.

which has everything to do with individual drivers and the simulator itself, and zero to do with THC's impact.

Next...

&gt;This program of research has shown that marijuana, when taken alone, produces a moderate degree of driving impairment which is related to consumed THC dose.

And here is the rest of that quote, key parts in bold:

&gt;The impairment manifests itself mainly in the ability to maintain a lateral position on the road, but its magnitude is not exceptional in comparison with changes produced by many medicinal drugs and alcohol. **Drivers under the influence of marijuana retain insight in their performance and will compensate when they can**, for example, by slowing down or increasing effort. **As a consequence, THC’s adverse effects on driving performance appear relatively small.**

Now that that is taken care of, on to your post itself.

&gt;The real problem is, where do you draw the line? You can't test pot on people, since it isn't legal. So you can't make a line of impairment like alcohol.

Which has everything to do with drug laws and once again absolutely nothing to do with the actual impairment of abilities and results.

&gt;Seems like the safer choice is to not allow people to drive on it.

It also *seems* like the Sun revolves around the Earth, and it *seems* like legalizing drugs would make use drastically shoot up... and yet once you actually learn wtf you're talking about, both of those matters clear up quite well.","1312160546"

You are awfully dismissive of used/vintage gear while I'm not sure you understand that most of what's made today is not very good.  You are lucky to live in Canada - the Canuck Audio Mart is a terrific resource.  You'll be able to find vintage/used gear that not only outperforms cheap consumer boxes, but will outlive them by a decade or two.

You'll probably notice that quite a few of us aren't keen on surround, either.  It's just a way to drive sales while giving little value and even lower performance.  The cheap plastic HTIB boxes are awful.  For the same price or less, you can run a very good two channel setup.

Also, looking at those receivers, I notice they don't have phonostages.  If you're going to run a turntable, you need one.  Do you already have a phonostage or are you planning to buy one?  This is also a good argument for buying used/vintage, because a lot of those come with a phonostage built in.","1312160561"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","A few months ago, I was at a restaurant with a few friends when Taylor Swift walks in. My friends, who know that I have a huge crush on her, start teasing me right away. I'm a very shy guy so even looking up to make sure they weren't making fun of me was hard, but indeed, I recognize her as she sits at her table at the back of the restaurant.  The teasing continues, ""Dude, she's totally checking her out"", ""Why don't you go talk to her, etc..."".

I can barely eat, my stomach is in knots. ""She's looking at you right now!"". I look up for a fraction of a second and we make eye contact. It did look like she was looking in my direction but of course, I don't believe it for a second.

""She's going to the lady's room"".

I know she's not looking in my direction this time, so I look up and indeed, she's making her way toward the bathroom. Suddenly, she turns around, stares me right in the eyes and flashes me an absolutely beautiful smile that completely melts me. She then disappears in the lady's room.

I am completely paralyzed, but one of my friends says ""You have to go talk to her, or you'll regret it for the rest of your life!"".

This one hits home. Too many times I've had crushes on girls but I never found the courage to go talk to them. Then I never see them again and the regrets haunt me. Not this time.

Ten minutes later, she comes out of the lady's room and starts walking toward her table. I stand up, to the amazement of my friends who never thought for a second that I'd find the courage. My legs are wobbly as I walk to intercept her. She notices me and slows down, we're looking at each other now. She looks like she's waiting for me.

I eventually face her. My mouth is filled with cotton, I can barely stand up, I feel like I'm about to throw up. But I pull myself together, and I say...

Because every once in a while you get that one waitress who is cute a bit flirty with you and my grandmother asks if I think she's cute.  I say yeah, flirt a bit more and just when my family is leaving and I'm about to go ask her for her number or give her mine my grandmother comes up behind me and says:

&gt;""Come on [stinker/stinky/boo-boo/panda and so on], we're all leaving now.""

She's 85 years old and constantly asking *""why I don't have a girlfriend or am married yet?""* And part of that is because she's always around to cock block me.

The last time I was on a date was with a single mother at a mall, we were just mall walking with her son and getting lunch, when all of a sudden my grandmother happens to be at the mall on that same day.

She then proceeds to go into a very embarrassing story from when I was about 3.  That's not why we stopped seeing each other but I couldn't look my girlfriend at the time in the eyes for the rest of the day.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I used to get plantar fasciitis (I think it was the result of being somewhat overweight, along with very high impact exercise). In my case dropping less than 10kg (96kg-87kg) was enough to make it go away completely.

With regard to losing weight, It was a real struggle to recalibrate my diet to start with. Cutting down on alcohol and carbs, having smaller lunches, was a bitch initially.

After a while though - a couple of weeks - I found that by eating healthier foods that I could hardly eat enough to get my daily calorie requirements. That was a real mindfuck, where I could not physically eat enough. And I was still eating a power of food, steaks, salads, etc. Just very little carbs. The weight started to fall off. Carbs and sugar are your enemy, the body turns them straight into fat.

I just found myself in the situation of having to put on some weight (to hit a weight division in my sport), never had that problem before in my life. Once I'm past this competition, I'll allow my weight to drop again, hopefully to around 82 kg.

I'm not some ""super metabolism"" person, I've been flabby for 10 years up until recently. Still have some weight to lose but it'll be relatively easy I think. And eating healthy is so much better than eating shit, once you get used to it.","1312160600"

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","That's true. But it's not all perpetual emigration. Our intellectual elites have always liked to study in Western Europe, even as early as the mid 19th century. They were the ones who brought back the spirit of freedom and equality from France in 1848, the ones who created Romania's modern judicial codes, laid the foundations of the country's first universities and academies. It was a breath of fresh air while we were under Ottoman rule, before 1877.

I hope today's generation does the same and manages to shake off the last scabs of Communism. And I believe most Romanians remain conscious of their origins. Travel and work within the EU are made easy, so many come back to open businesses and invest here after they establish themselves abroad.

The ones who do remain in the West are a sign of which sectors have dire issues - first of all, the doctors and nurses who've left en masse to France, Germany and Scandinavia. The Romanian health system is a shambles.","1312160608"

Since many of these mental issues arise in the teens and early 20s, which also coincides with first/heavy marijuana use, it is difficult to tease apart cause and affect. If you have mental illness of this nature you would be well advised to avoid marijuana, along with most other hard drugs. 

This should all be taken with a grain of salt though. Common sense should reign, and just as I would advise patients to avoid marijuana if they have a chronic pulmonary disease, I would also tell some folks with mental illness to avoid marijuana. Not sure why this is considered a conspiracy. The data are there and speak for themselves, though more study is always needed.

Yeah, that's typically what a front-ender does. And most quite capable of hackers .. knowing how to at least make it look at close to the original PSD as possible in many browsers. 

But you likely have come accross elements of the design, that can't look identical. And you may even have experienced the situation where those elements end up breaking the design.

For example: using the same font in an image of a button, and then then also using the font as rendered by the browser. The design may depend on all these fonts to look the same, but now they don't .. on _some devices_. 

Any experienced company knows that they can't expect miracles from translating a PSD into a website though. They're just praying whatever breaks isn't crucial to the design's consistency and 'feel'.","1312160627"

In 1620, one could travel from Europe to North America and find everything there necessary to sustain life. With some basic tools and minimal supplies, it was possible to settle there. In fact, humans were living there already.

No other planet in the solar system can sustain life. To survive on Mars or any other place off of Earth will require a huge infrastructure to be built, and it's not obvious if it is even possible. Even if such a settlement is established, it's hard to say what the point is.","1312160630"

""Disparate priorities and cultures"" were to be extolled as they would prevent tyranny by a majority, since no single faction could possibly hold a monopoly on all issues. Instead, factions would be forced to form moderate, ever changing coalitions, keeping powers in check. 

And if you think about it, that's exactly what has happened throughout American history. The democrat party used to be the party of segregation and social conservatism. Now it's the party of liberalism and tolerance. Reagan's Republican Party better resembles modern Democrats rather than Republicans. This happens because of coalition changes. In the 80/90's the Republicans really started appealing to Christians, so today you have a weird coalition of Evangelists, Libertarians, and Old People. In the 60s, the democrats aligned with the civil rights movement, so today they have an equally weird coalition of African Americans and Manhattan Elites.

I played a game today with the worst player I've ever played with so far. **Story below.**

Today I got zoned out by my own lane mate (a Galio) and was denied XP and CS as a carry (Vayne), since I was forced to tower hug if I wanted to stay alive. If they're in the brush right at our turrent, why do you keep farming in the middle of the lane, pushing it away from me? It's obvious it's me (being very squishy) that they want, why don't you just go into the brush and tell them to get out of there? So, everyone (3) in the lane was level 6 and I was level 4, having 1/3rd as much farm as Galio (since he stole every possible last hit with his AoE spells). I even warded for the Fiddle gank, and Fiddle really wanted me so he stood there for 30-40 seconds, before Galio came back into the lane and hit him with a spell to say ""Hi"", making Fiddle run away and getting more XP/farm - I mean, I'm sure Fiddle would have stayed there another half a minute at least without any chance of getting to me. At the end Galio blamed me for losing and said he'd report me.

Oh, regarding your Trynda story. I played Leona for the first time yesterday (since she's free I thought I'd try it). Unlike what I usually do I didn't read any guides beforehand, I thought a tank was simple enough (I play a lot of tanks). Anyways, I totally messed up, made a lot of bad calls and overestimated my team mate's ability to do damage (a Yorick, guess he got nerfed really hard since he did almost no damage at all). Also, I got W first, thinking it's a cool spell and I'm likely to harass the other team ... this was apparently my first mistake according to Yorick. Since even after I'd hit level 6-7 he kept saying that you should get Q 1st and E 2nd on Leona and use the EQ-combo ... I mean, why continue to complain about it when it's already over and done with a long time ago? It's not like I can rewind time like Zilean and go back and pick another 1st spell.

Something has to give, and unfortunately, education is an easy target. Local governments are being keel-hauled by falling real estate values causing property tax income to plummet.

It's ugly out there. Personally, I think a lot of the so-called reform is cost reduction in disguise. Why pay $7,300-10,000 in per pupil funding to the local public school (when you add capital expenditures to operating funding) when you can outsource by voucher (or charter) at $4,500? Union wages or not, that's a 38-50% cut off the top, and politicians sell it by telling parents, ""look, you can send your child to a BETTER charter, parochial or private school and we cut 38% and don't have to raise your taxes.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","Well, not exactly. Our side of the argument has tons of verifiable evidence and replicable tests and data, and your side doesn't have any. So for me to say 'It's likely that matter has always existed,' carries more weight than 'god has always existed,' as there has never been any evidence of anything supernatural ever existing, ever.

So if you'd like to try to pull credibility from our side to your side by thinking they're equally possible options, go right ahead. It is not, however, the pot calling the kettle black. It is all to often that people such as yourself think that 'agreeing to disagree' means both sides are equal. 

Honestly, the fact that scientific data can actually be seen as the counter weight to a cobbled together fictional story written by thousands of different people, fabricated and embellished on over time is ludicrous. The two could not be more imbalanced.

So I restate: We have plenty of evidence of the physical world and many replicable tests which have observed the characteristics of matter. You, however, have no evidence for your god.

You are lucky that you can do that with impunity.

I have family members who are really good at whipping up an angry mob if they get crossed, or even if they just feel like it. They use other people as weapons.

There is more to lying than simply making false statements. Pathological liars project unreality about them as if they were radiating darkness. It is like being caught in the gravitational pull of a black hole.

The way it works, I think, is that reality is written in longhand, but out of necessity we deal with it in a truncated way, a kind of shorthand, which, for the most part, just about works - even though it tends to be blurry, indistinct and not necessarily consistent. The shorthand way of thinking is easier to consume - a kind of fast food for the soul, and it is more difficult and uncomfortable to see things the longhand way - reality resists being understood.

Pathological liars are experts at manipulating this shorthand, sending out signals that people just accept without even checking against reality.

The greater part of a lie is the punishment of disbelief -  that two percent of ludicrous falsehood would not stand up to a moments reflection if it were not accompanied up by ninety eight percent threat.

I think that this veiled aggression, emotional or physical, that backs up a lie is the worst part, the way it pulls you in.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I was well aware that OP herself was not complaining. I understand she was talking about comments made to others. I also *agreed* that people should not make those types of comments because they *don't* know what kind of person they are dealing with. My comment was not attacking OP or saying that *she* was complaining. 

As for your comments on the medical view point, starvation (non-anorexic/non-bulimic) in this/other countries is irrelevant to this conversation and has nothing to do with the issue at hand. 

I really would like to make the argument that females today need to toughen-up. I realize this is insensitive, but in the American/western society, women are held to unrealistic standards of physical appearance. It has been made clear these inappropriate standards drive the kind of issues being discussed in this thread. Unrealistically thin models/celebrities and airbrushed images are driving women and girls to harm themselves in attempts to be thin. I see this as an incredibly sad and dangerous situation. 

However, it's about time we stopped dragging ourselves through the mud and stopped letting others get us down when a comment is made about our appearance. What good does it do to let some comment about us eating carrots bother us the rest of the day? Like I said before, these people are jealous/insecure/whatever. If you are really around people that make comments like that *everyday* then you need to seek out some new friends or file a complaint at your workplace, etc. 

I realize my opinion is not appreciated, but it's not that productive to just have a blindly emotional circle-jerk. So fine, feel bad that someone feels the need to comment on your superior eating habits in a negative way, but at least you get to know you are in the right and eating the way you should. 

EDIT: and another thing; everyone is telling us all the time how we need to look. They say we need to be skinny/have big boobs/a sweet ass, etc. People say we need curves, then they say we don't. Then we actually achieve ""skinny"" and people give us shit for eating a certain way or for how thin we are. When is it going to stop? When will we be what society wants? I don't know, but for right now, if able, we need to just *stop*. *giving*. *a shit*. It isn't easy, but IMO it's necessary to stop caring what everyone else wants from our bodies.

Again, some *might*, but there is never any guarantee that there exists enough latent demand for anything, whether more goods or labor or services. The economy may take months or years for the additional profit collected by the laying off company to circulate around and generate the new demand that will employ those workers. In the meantime, they have rent and bills and medical expenses--human beings can't just sit in a warehouse until they're needed again, like TVs or sofas or frozen orange juice.

I am familiar with the arguments that you are making and I know the arguments in favor of layoffs. Some out of touch nitwit economist called it the ""totem of talent"" in a paper several years back. If it says something else, can you summarize it for me?

&gt;there comes a time when jobs become obsolete and you must learn a new set of skills.

Yes, but what do people do in the meantime? What do they eat while they're learning new skills? On paper, labor is fungible. In reality, learning new jobs skills represents an enormous drain on a worker's time and money, a risk that many cannot afford to take.","1312160692"

Favorite flavor is an opinion. Worst movie is an opinion. Current tax rate as a percentage of GDP is a fact. You can dispute the *value* of the current rate by putting forth well reasoned evidence, but the actual value is not an opinion. You can want them to include various other factors or not include them, but the actual numbers are not opinions. Since I provided evidence that details how the value is obtained and it works out the same way from multiple sources, it is likely the true value. You and the OP can call your beliefs opinions but that does not make the actual value what you believe or want it to be.

It is a fact that polls on quality of life and many interrelated facets (expected lifespan, economic equality, economic mobility, freedom of press, happiness, education, literacy, access to healthcare) show a correlation to better outcomes with higher taxes/GDP. The US ranks lower than pretty much all European countries on many of these factors. I'm not saying we should go one way or the other, only that the data is there.","1312160703"

The self enclosed lifeboats are nice, they come equipped with radio and you should only have to be in one for around a day before rescue. And as cybergibbons mentions they are self righting.

The problem is that there is actually two types of modern life boat, one is the enclosed plastic/fibreglass boat you see in OP's picture. The other is a self inflating dingy.

The self inflating lifeboats are popular because they take up much less space on board ship. They can fit into a small barrel and sit on the side of a ship. In a emergency these are flung over the side and then (supposedly) self inflate. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Amandine33.jpg

Unlike the larger lifeboats these are **not** self righting and if they inflate the wrong way up you have to climb onto it's back and topple it over on top of you, then you swim out from underneath it and climb on board. Which is difficult in a nice calm flat sea... in any type of a storm it is much, much harder.

And forget about dolphins.

Sure sometimes dolphins will rescue shipwrecked sailors, but most of the time they just swim around laughing and looking cute while you slowly drown. 

Many a sailor died hating that chirpy dolphin grin. ","1312160706"

Bitcoin is far more risky than gold - even if gold falls all the way back into the doldrums of the 1970s or whatever, that's still... what, $5m of gold?

Certainly, kosher restaurants in general could up their game - other than Jewish staples (roast chicken, soups...) most dishes at kosher restaurants are average at best, often really terrible. There is no reason that they can't make a decent pasta or steak. But I'm talking a whole different level of ""good food"". I'm talking trendy good. The kind of place that would get written up in food magazines, somewhere that non-frum and non-Jews would go because of the great food.

I am looking to become a Transit cop in the NY/NJ area. These police officers are government backed, start at 70k and are essentially an extension of homeland security. However, in general i would love to be a cop or state trooper also.

I keep hearing that no one likes MPs? Is it based on them being the debbie downers of the Army since they have to crack down on everyone? Does anyone have a positive experience with being a MP? I have some other jobs that are of interest to me so i can keep looking into them, but I thought a MP would be clutch given my future interests.

So why am i leaving finance? Well, my wife and i both work for a major financial institution, which is losing money left and right (who isn't right?). Well, we are sick of living in worry that we are going to both get laid off, have no where to turn to for a job, and not having a degree to fall back on. 

We both just want that confidence that we have a degree and will be looked at on the same level as any other applicant for a future job. In addition, we both HATE finance and want to go another route. She wants to be a nurse and i want to be a police officer. 

While i know we don't have a terrible life at all and that some are out of jobs, sometimes a decision like this is not for the money. We want to enjoy our life instead of being unhappy working each day for a paycheck. Whether that means less pay or not, we think being happy will out weigh it.

So, if not a MP, does anyone have some good suggestions on MOS for my future interests or just some that are awesome?","1312160728"

My interpretation of our government is that we elect representatives to carry out our will *when feasible*, and to do what they believe is right when otherwise.  Neither a mere arm of the population nor a total dictator, but a sort of steward of the state.","1312160741"

I'm not saying it's not a *stressful* environment, but in some groups programmers are treated very well by the traders.  It helps when an HFT team has dedicated development resources.  Teams which are split between the trading side and development side (both under the same leadership and budget) tend to have greater synergy and a more amicable working relationship.  Ultimately, it boils down to who's running the team, and in our case, he's a really great guy.","1312160746"

The point is, if every person who ever walked into a store front used their smart phone and checked out a business' BBB standing prior to stepping into the store, and every person who ever had issue with a business made a complaint via the BBB, then yes, the BBB would be useful. However, not everyone checks out customer reviews (again, I bet 99/100 don't think to look up a business on the BBB before going there), not everyone has smart phones, not everyone files a complaint when they have an issue, and since the BBB has no actual AUTHORITY, and no resolution is likely to come of a complaint, all it serves to do is warn others, which not everyone is inclined to do. SO, again, the BBB is next to useless.

"fffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu","t5_2qqlo","Metric system is a unit system invented out of thin air by a group of scientists. It's alright for science... it's still just as arbitrary as the Imperial system.

Imperial system is a unit system that stood the test of time. The survivor of natural selection of unit systems, if you will.

Imperial system is actually way more efficient. Consider the foot, which is 12 inches. 12 is a great number for division. Since one of the primary operations with units is dividing them into halves, thirds, and quarters, it's perfect. 10 is just an arbitrary number; we just happen to have 10 fingers and it doesn't have any numerical significance. 12 is a neatly divisible number.

Consider the pound. 16 ounces. It's divisible four times with no decimals. In nearly any practical situation, the pound is preferable to the kilogram because of this. Similarly, usage of fractions makes multiplication and division much easier. Addition, too, if you don't have access to an aid of some sort and if you aren't retarded.

If you actually use these units outside natural science (construction and retail come to mind), you'll see why the Imperial system is actually far more practical and ""works out evenly and in squares"".

Rest of the world screams at the US to conform to their system because it is advantageous for both parties to adopt the same system. In terms of practicality, though, metric system really isn't an improvement over the Imperial system. It's just that people don't bother coming up with an original opinion so instead they adopt ""metric system is superior herp derp scientists said so."" Scientific research isn't the only field that uses unit systems. And even us ignant Amurricans use metric system in science anyway, so it's a moot point.","1312160794"

Never possible.  Your reports won't even make it to, let alone through, the tribunal.  You won't get banned.  

HOWEVER, I'd recommend you don't play solo-queue anyways.   It is one thing to have a bad game, but it is another to go into a game knowing you can't possibly perform up to what are perfectly reasonable expectations:

&gt; I'm still learning the finesse behind when to rush in on the enemy carries and pop endless rage

You need to be playing against bots until you have that down.  That is Tryndamere's only trick.  He can zoom across the map with his spin, he can heal, he can slow, but his handiest, and most-game-changing ability is his ability to ult, get a few seconds of life, then come back from near-dead (to be ignited, but that's neither here nor there).

If you are playing poorly because you don't understand how to play your champion, that's not solo-queue being filled with douches, that's you being a douche and ruining the game for them.  They may ALSO be douches, but you weren't any better joining a game and not being able to perform up to the standards they can reasonably expect.

LoL is a VERY snowbally game, so from what you've described it WAS a perfectly possible that you were the reason your team lost.  If they had to carry a trynd who cannot use his invulnerability to kill enemy carries.  That being said, you still shouldn't have been reported, and you certainly wont get banned.

Please remember that people will essentially waste an hour of their lives not having any fun if they expect you to be a competent teammate and instead you come into a game and say ""LOL, Annie can stun?  Whooooo!"" they're not going to have any fun, and multiply that by 4 allies.

It sucks having a noob on your team, and raging is natural at that guy, but feel free to ignore it, since there's real no negative to you, their reports won't matter, and all that happens to you is you lose a game.  It does REALLY suck for them though, so PLEASE don't join games with characters you don't know how to play.

**EDIT:** Just to put this into perspective - 

&gt; I'm not gonna risk the fun I can have with my friends...

You're perfectly willing to risk other people's fun, please take others into account as well and don't join games with new champs you don't know how to play.","1312160794"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","This reminded me of a joke:

A man enters a luxury restaurant and chooses a table for one. The waiter approaches and proceeds to recitate the suggestions for the day; however, the man interrupts him politeley, demanding instead a piece of cutlery used by the cook.

The waiter is not amused by this request, but in the end complies. The man closes his eyes and deeply whiffs the scent of the hardware. 

'Aah' -he exclaims- 'The veal is perfect today. I'd like it with some those special potatoes and not too much of that wine sauce.'

Impressed, the waiter brings the order. The man eats his meal with delight, pays and leaves.

The following day, the same scene repeats itself. The man arrives for lunch, asks to be served by the same waiter and voices his strange request once again. 

'Does it have to be the same tool as yesterday?' -asks the waiter-
'No. It can be anything, as long as it was used by the cook' -replies the man-

And then and there, the man carefully sniffs the item with ecstasy. After a few moments, he states:

'Today, I'll have the cod. Plenty of that Portuguese olive oil and a side order of wild rice.'

The waiter delivers, but believes the man is somehow pulling his thumb. So, he starts thinking of ways to decieve him. As the next day arrives, the now usual scene unfolds once more. However, when the man asks for an item, the waiter goes inside the kitchen and asks a maid -A hot, voluptuous girl, known to be a nympho - :

'Sandra, take this spoon and pass it through your crotch several times. I wanna try something'
The girl smiles, delights herself on such a kinky request, and performs the task.

With a serious demeanor, the waiter delivers the tool to the man. After a few ecstasic whiffs, the man throws back his head and mischeviously eyes the waiter:

'Tell me pal, how long has Sandra been working here?'

I see this so damn much. I was going to say I'm guilty of it myself but then I thought about what I actually built at base and it's just teleporter entrances and sentries after the first goes down and I can still teleport back to the front. Everything else including that all important first sentry is made on site. The only reason I'll build a sentry outside of spawn is because it's safe and once I get it built I can teleport right back to the front line with a boxed level 3. I agree that you absolutely have to get that teleporter going first to make any kind of decent stand.

If your whole base goes down it's imperative that you get the teleporter going first then building your stuff right there. Making your team mobile again is key to holding a point or stopping the cart.","1312160807"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm really depressed but sometimes I feel like I blow it out of proportion slightly, to get attention. Then that makes me more depressed because I have to stoop to that level. I get so furiously angry sometimes, and only at my family, which hurts, because they're the most well-meaning people. I get angry at the most trivial things, and then five minutes later, I'm laughing and I've forgotten about it. Then, if ANYONE does anything to ruin my sudden good mood, I get angry again. Then I get so frustrated and upset that I cry for a really long time. And then I'll go back to my good mood once I've stopped crying. My moods NEVER last for long. Nobody besides my family ever sees this side of me.

I tell everyone that I really enjoy smoking weed and I think I do when I'm not high, but as soon as I do get high I get really uncomfortable. 

I hate myself for eating so much, even though I'm not that overweight, really. I just can't stop eating. 

I really need a job and I'm completely broke. I don't want to go back to school this fall, because I dropped out of a theater major and now all of my classes won't transfer and I'm starting over as a freshman. I went from a huge state university to a really small community college doing general studies, and I really REALLY don't want to do it. I just want to work and move out, but if I don't go to school, I won't be able to afford to move out, because my mom won't pay for anything of mine anymore.

I hate living at home and I want to move to Michigan with my best friend. I can't afford to buy a car, so I can't afford to go. 

I really want to start my whole life over. 

I have no idea what I want to do with my life, but for the first time, I don't care about dating or looking good for a guy. I just want to make myself happy. 

I really want to start seeing a psychiatrist and get medicated for the depression, anger and anxiety, so I can start feeling normal for once in my life, and not like I want to beat my siblings or pull my hair out. I'm afraid that if I get close to someone romantically, they'll see this side of me and hate me. 

I recently went to stay with a guy for a weekend who I thought I really really liked, and all of a sudden for some reason beyond anything he did, it all seemed really unimportant. Like I didn't need to be there, or that I didn't belong there. So I left before he woke up, and texted him later telling him my mom needed me at home. I haven't spoken to him since, and I feel really bad about it, but I don't know what to say to him. I feel extra bad because he took me out and spent his money on me and I am NOT the type of person to usually let someone do that, so I'm afraid he thinks I used him, which is absolutely not the case; my leaving was unrelated. He's a Redditor so I'm hoping maybe he'll see this? I don't know. He's a really nice guy and he doesn't deserve that. I feel like shit about it, but again, I have no idea what to say to him.

We had to develop technologies and mutations and farmlands just to support our population. Normally, the carrying capacity is less than 1 billion I believe. We are changing the ecosystem and destroying habitats just to feed ourselves. That's worse than rabbits do you know...At least they have SOME natural predators in some places.

Half a million humans are born per day you realize. You said there are 600 million rabbits or so. I highly doubt that each year, 182 million rabbits are born per year. Thus, more humans are born per day than rabbits are.

There are tons of examples in history where nature wipes out the herbivores cause they ate too much. Of course there's a period of time in which the ecosystem is screwed, but it usually repairs itself within a hundred years.

What's worse than not having the capacity to learn and change is having it but not doing it. Most of the world is satisfied with just themselves and not the planet or ecosystem.

Rape does happen in the animal world (bottlenose dolphins gang rape  lol), but most females in the wild have developed defenses for that (such as being bigger and badder than their male counterparts). Female animals ARE usually bigger than the males. Rape isn't as much as a problem. And it's not like nature has whores and sex slaves o.O Or necrophiliacs and other violent fetishes.","1312160828"

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","I'm not sure I'm well-versed enough to give a great example and explain it at a five-year-old level, this is probably at least middle-school territory, but I'll give it a shot:

2, 3, 5, 7 and 11 are all prime numbers.  This means you can't divide them by any other numbers (aside from itself and one) and end up with a whole number.

Take any two prime numbers and multiply them.  Let's pick 3 and 5.  3 x 5 = 15.  Now, pretend for a moment you weren't just told about 3 and 5.  All you have is the number 15, and you need to find the two prime numbers that we multiplied to get there.

That's called factoring, and there's not really an easier way to do it than by just guessing and checking.  15's pretty small, so it's manageable.  Does 2 work?  Nope, that gives us 7.5.  Does 3?  Yup, that gives us 5.

We got the answer, but it took two steps to get there.  Let's try something harder--I've gone to a website that lists a whole lot of prime numbers, I picked two and multiplied them.  I came up with: 62,615,533.

Figuring this out by guessing will take a person a good bit of time.  If we know this is the product of two primes.  I can get a list of a bunch of prime numbers in advance and use that so there's fewer numbers to try.  If I guessed and checked by hand, going down the list of prime numbers one at a time, it would take me almost a thousand tries to get the right numbers--7,907 &amp; 7,919.  That would probably take me hours.

I could program a computer to do the same thing.  Give it a big list of primes to try, tell it to try them one-by-one, and it could probably give me an answer in one second.

So let's try a number with more digits . . . 10,967,535,067.  The computer has to guess and check 10,000 times to get the right answers for this one, so now it takes 10 seconds.

So all we need to do, is give a computer a long enough number to start from, and we could make it take millions of years to solve just by guessing and checking.","1312160836"

My problem with the compromise is that cutting government spending during a recession is how you prolong a recession. While I like the idea of closing tax loopholes, I'm not going to be happy with any solution to a deficit that targets expenditures and ignores revenue. And the 'idea' of closing tax loopholes is all we really have. I'll believe them when I see them, considering we have a problem enforcing the tax laws and financial regulations we have now.

As far as the other concessions the progressives were given, that you listed, allowing a vote on a balanced budget amendment *is something we're giving them*. They get to make the failure of the attempt back to their voters and rally the base against the democrats that stopped it, as well as tout their fiscal conservative credentials.

Plus, according to google, the total amount of medicare fraud totaled $23.7 billion compared to the program's $1.7 trillion total budget (all numbers are from 2007). That's just about 1.4%, so provided you can eliminate all fraud (without spending a dime on it) there's another 2.6% (about 44 billion dollars) of cuts you're going to have to find in operations. The government isn't as inefficient as the libertarians have convinced us. Saying significant cuts can be handled by eliminating fraud is a cop out.

The biggest problem I have with the whole thing is probably what's going to hurt the republicans anyway. This debt crisis was going to hurt us in three months anyway, when S&amp;P threatened to downgrade our credit rating. We were going to have to deal with it's immediacy anyway. But instead of handling the situation in a way that failure would *hurt* us, the republicans in the house hitched it to the debt ceiling, and now failure will *kill* us. And they did it just so they could have the debate on their terms. If the republicans are in anyway unhappy with the compromise, they're complaining about the ransom money feeling too light.

I'm not satisfied that the progressives got a thing, politics included. ""We'll really get 'em next time"" is something I've heard many, many times. The election is still a long way away. By then, all the moderates will remember will be their cynicism.

As far as they're concerned, both sides were unreasonable during the healthcare debate. It ended up being a political win for the republicans. They completely forgot about the public option. The exact same thing will happen here.

When you sacrifice policy for politics, you're loosing to the republicans at the game they invented.","1312160839"

A primary cause of bugs which was our fault was scaling. We made some bug cities during development but not as big and dense as some people were able to attain over time. Some scaling issues were hard to predict and handle ahead of time. The part that's hard to blame us for is slowness that resulted. The amount of simulation needed for the most huge cities is ridiculous.

For the record, while Maxis was in the process of being acquired by EA at the time, EA is not a primary cause of problems that people attribute to the game. If anything EA would have been able to provide more extensive testing services than Maxis had.","1312160846"

Where did that come from? Did it come from the same place that says the UK is more dangerous for cyclists than Australia? I have an English friend who disagrees and so do I. Do you have any evidence to contradict us?

Saying Walking is more dangerous than cycling is like saying bees are more dangerous than sharks (which technically they are). Lots of pedestrians die but people who say this forget that every single cyclist is also a pedestrian at some point whereas only a small fraction of walkers are ever riders. There are lots more pedestrians than cyclists so they're bound to account for more accidents. Per head though cyclists have more accidents than pedestrians. 

That one study was speficially done in Australian conditions. It conclusively proved that helmets laws are saving lives. 

One thing that is conclusive is that helmets save lives. More people wearing helmets means more lives saved. It's logical really.

"teaching","t5_2qyj9","I used to do a multi-day group activity, where students established rules, etc. It was a great buy-in for them, but they tended to have the same rules at the end, and I couldn't keep track of which classes had which rules, and didn't want to enforce the ""Sing I'm a little tea-pot"" consequence. So I ended up just telling them and giving them a list of 10. Here's what my students get in 9th grade (note: I can't figure out how to go from 1 to 2 after bullets, so 1 is repeated):


**Class Rules and Expectations**

1.	Respect yourself and others.

•	Treat them as you would want to be treated, and as they want to be treated.

•	Use good manners.

•	No name-calling, or racist/homophobic/sexist comments.

•	No touching.

•	No taking.

2.	Three minutes for bathroom/locker pass. No locker passes during first/last five minutes of class. Ask for the pass at an appropriate break. 

3.	No throwing anything. Dispose of trash by walking to the trash can at a break or at the end of class.

4.	Raise your hand to speak, and listen without speaking while others are speaking.

5.	Don’t distract others by talking, tapping, etc.

6.	No profanity.

7.	Class begins and ends at the bells. You are expected to be in class on time. Fourth lateness in a quarter = 3:30 detention. Going out the door before the bell = one warning, then 3:30 detention.

8.	No hats, cell phones or music players. They must be left in your locker. 1st offense: warning. 2nd offense: confiscated until end of class. 3rd offense: confiscated until end of day. 4th offense: returned only to a parent/guardian. 

9.	Come prepared. Pens and pencils are available if they were found on the floor and put in the pencil cup on the desk. Coming to class without a pencil/pen and book four times in a quarter = 3:30 detention. Replacement copies of handouts are available for a price set by your teacher.

10.	Promote mature, positive, responsible behavior that will help us to have a productive and enjoyable class that we can look forward to every day.

Consequences
Depending on the severity and frequency of the infraction, the following consequences are available. 

Kind verbal warning.				Phone call home.
Harsh verbal warning.				3:30 detention and phone call home.
Change of seat.					Loss of pass privileges
Removal from classroom.				Change of schedule.

Granted the same risk is there with a HDD, but that risk is low. They say SSD's are now as reliable as a HDD, the only brand where I don't see a bunch of 1 egg and 1 star reviews for failures is Intel.

The drives are expensive and many review sites say the increase is about 40% more. I lived with HDD speeds for a long time, I can wait until they get even faster, more reliable, and the price finally decreases. Most of my apps load in less than 5 seconds already, both Win7 and Lion load up to a usable state within 25 seconds.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","The title was ""the moment I *questioned* my faith,"" not the moment I became an atheist.

It's true, there are a lot of these apparent moments that people have where either one of their loved ones died in a stupid way (""God has a plan"") or basically saying animals are worthless in God's eyes since they aren't human. Or realizing that you have no way of telling whether or not the voice in your head is God, Satan, or yourself. Something about any of those seems *intuitively* (if I may say) wrong to that person and it leads them to thinking whether or not certain aspects of their religion are wrong or if they have a misinterpretation. 

Of course, I feel I'm on the outside looking in a bit because I've never been religious -- never been indoctrinated, only went to a few Midnight Masses for my grandparents. But just because people believing in God can start believing in him as an emotional reaction to something, it doesn't mean an emotional reaction isn't a valid reason to question your beliefs.

Don't you see how the perpetuates an ""Us vs them"" idea of the world? This is the same idea that leads to patriotism, which is the only way presidents justify going to war. They stir up nationalism to get support. 

Your culture is 90% of who I am, who you are. All the words we use, the way we express our emotions, the social structures we grew up in, school, college, media... that's all culture. Without culture, we're just Netherlands. Culture may not be the reason you're competitive, but it's certainly the reason you play tennis or football instead of badminton or cricket. Other cultures do not place such a strong value on sports, like most of Asia for example. 

Of course sports is more than just money and distraction, but the sheer amount of emphasis and importance it's given is a cultural thing. Other countries/cultures do not do this like we do. ","1312160909"

"Anthropology","t5_2qkdk","Rape within a social group may not always not as costly as you think, I believe.  It is clearly damaging to the social order when it's impregnating women who are already spoken, but for unattached women it could be an ""easy way"" to force a mate selection that would otherwise be be impossible.  Like when the male is undesirable to the female or her family for whatever reason.  Once he's got his ""foot in the door"" by impregnating her (and assuming he wants to provide for the child), then it might make sense for the family to allow him into their circle.  This might explain things like the ""marry your attacker"" biblical laws.

It isn't the best strategy in the long term because it's allowing undesirables to make their way into social circles where they otherwise would be selected out, but a small degree of it would make evolutionary sense to keep genetic variation mobile and flowing across classes.","1312160910"

This argument always stops my catholic mother, born again sister, and several friends I used to have till they became Pentecostal in their tracks and makes them think about things for a while.  Then they come back with a slightly less extreme view on their religion; it'll quiet them down until they go back to church and get revved up in jesus again.

1. Try to keep the upper voices within an octave.  This rule holds true for any number of voices.  The distance from the bass to the second lowest pitch can be more than an octave, but try to keep it within a 12th (octave and a fifth).

2. I notice a lot of doubled pitches, which is fine to do occasionally, but measures 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 all contain doubled pitches.  With only 3 voices, you're really leaving out an entire third of the chord for each of those measures.  

3. Be careful of the notes in measure 4, as the distance between the notes D and C is a minor 7th (which is considered dissonant and should be avoided in first species)

I tend to think psychologists have their own hangups, and it bleeds over into their profession. They're conditioned by their peers, and by society at large, to turn whatever unusual thought they come across in their daily interactions with patients into potential baby-raping terrorism.

The best thing to do, when speaking to a mental health professional is to *keep your murder thoughts to yourself*, if you're pretty sure there's nothing wrong with you that would warrant such an admission. Only say such a thing if you're worried you might actually lose control of that light side/dark side firewall (in Freudian psychoanalysis it's called the ""superego"", by the way) and allow the inner h4x0r virii (the ""id"") to escape.

There are several java memory options you can set to limit this growth.  http://www.caucho.com/resin-3.0/performance/jvm-tuning.xtp

If you gave java 6 gigs in the Xmx it'll use everything you have.  ","1312160927"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","&gt; With all the busyness of ferrying off US astronauts into space and returning them home safely their mars rovers aren't finished yet, but according to this article they're going to try to actually bring back samples from Mars. If they succeed this is yet another first accomplishment they've managed.

Our last duo of rovers were fantastic, and Russia has failed pretty hard when it comes to Mars.  I was just using it as another example of US space supremacy.

&gt; Of coursey ou'll be rooting against them, having turned scientific endeavour into a cheap nationalistic fight.

Don't get me wrong.  I love science, space exploration, and everything about it.  I have deep respect for Russians and their scientific ability.  More so than any other country in fact.  There's no question that they've been an amazing adversary, and then even better, an amazing friend when it come to space exploration.

&gt; A miniture space shuttle meant to sabotage sattelites and spy on countries compares to sending people to the international space station how?

Russia can temporarily do one thing we can't.  Compare that to the vast achievements and technology the US has amassed from the space race. 

Hell, the original player, the USSR, isn't even around anymore.  If there's a US/Russia space race it's still not quite the US/USSR space race which is over, done, and in the history books.

AVOID AVOID AVOID the Skydeck at the SEARS Tower. Unless you get there RIGHT when it opens the lines are ridiculously long. (It may not look like it outside, but the line wraps around to get to the elevators, then there's a SECOND line downstairs just to get tickets, and ANOTHER line to wait for the elevators up to the skydeck)

Get a Chicago Hot Dog with everything on it. You'll never get anything like it anywhere else.

Go to one (Or all) of the museums in the museum campus. The Shedd Aquarium is beautiful, one of my favorites.

Go to Navy Pier but don't buy food there, it's overpriced. You can also take a boat tour along the Chicago River. I recommend the Wendella Architectural tour. You get a great view of the city (But make sure to get there 30min./an hour ahead of time to get a guaranteed seat on top, instead of having to sit in the inside.

Rent a bike and bike along the lakefront. We have beautiful scenic views and an amazing bike path along the lake. 

Go to either Ed Debevics or Dick's Last Resort but make sure you both have a good sense of humor or you won't feel welcome.

"politics","t5_2cneq","I wrote ""one good quantifiable indication"".
That is not simplistic, sorry.  It is quite quantifiable and quite real.  

Your example is a good one.
The results are the same basically as the patents show.
So, using the patents is one good indicator, as I wrote, because the results your formulaic approach uses reaches almost the same results for the top 3:
Rank	Country	Overall	Innovation Inputs	Innovation Performance

1	 South Korea	2.26	1.75	2.55

2	 United States	1.80	1.28	2.16

3	 Japan	1.79	1.16	2.25

So since the patents are a good indicator, very simple and very quantifiable, and lead to almost exactly the same result then my statement was true, according to your own example.  
 
Why do you lead with an insult?

EDIT: I see why you lead with an insult, because you don't like the implication that creativity isn't ""USA! USA!""  So you use a business model to measure what is creativity.  From your own source: 
""Outputs included patents, technology transfer, and other R&amp;D results; business performance, such as labor productivity and total shareholder returns; and the impact of innovation on business migration and economic growth.""
This is your own source, a business model source to your liking, stating that ""patents"" are one of the outputs measured to determine their 'creativity' index.  

EDIT 2:  Your lack of response and downvote show that your post was politically motivated and you stand by your gratuitous insult. ","1312160960"

If you super-heat a gas (by say, firing a giant spark through it) the molecules that gasses usually form (such as oxygen which forms a O2 molecule in a gaseous state) are torn apart and a large portion of the atoms are ionized (have gained, or lost one or more electrons.) The combined stream (in the case of lightning) of positively charged ions, and electrons is called plasma.

I think thetrevelife is correct in that this girl made it clear she wasn't interested in you and that you missed the cues all along. In the end, you may feel as though you walked away in a power position, but the truth is, she dragged you around all day and you have nothing to show. To top it off, you spent all of this lusting energy towards someone who is not your girlfriend. IMO game isn't an excuse to act like a douche or a scumbag - it's about opening up and meeting people. I understand that sometimes exaggerations take over and we manipulate the truth to obtain something we want - it's human nature. But if you've made a commitment to another girl, go use your energy for good in that place. That being said, hanging out and having a great time with another girl while you have a girlfriend isn't wrong. But your approach and your story is based on picking this girl up. Not only did you miss cues, fail at PU and get dragged around town for hours on end, but you did it in hopes of a physical connection while you have a girlfriend. This gives PU a bad name. Thanks.

"cheatatmathhomework","t5_2rbfw","It turns out that functions of complex numbers have very interesting properties and some satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations (possibly some of the most awesome equations ever). Now, one of the most amazing results (that is easily shown with some knowledge of infinite series) is that e^*i*z = cos(z) + *i*sin(z). This is called Euler's formula.

This equation combines complex numbers, exponentials and trigonometry. In the case that z = pi, we get e^*i*pi = cos(pi) + *i*sin(pi). We know that sin(pi) = 0 and cos(pi) = -1, so we get what is famously called Euler's identity: e^*i*pi = -1.

Many mathematicians have considered this to be one of the most beautiful equations ever written because of the depth behind the subject and how simply stated and unexpected it is. But I digress.

Before I mentioned that complex numbers can be represented as a point in the complex plane with a horizontal and vertical component. Now, if we consider 2D vectors, how do we get the x component and y component? Well, if you recall, x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ). We'll come back to this in a moment.

Consider the number re^*i*θ where both r and θ are real numbers. What does this equal? By what we stated previously, re^*i*θ = r(cos(θ) + *i*sin(θ)) = rcos(θ) + r*i*sin(θ). If we let x = rcos(θ) and y = rsin(θ) (like for 2D vectors), we see that this is just x + *i*y.

From this we conclude that complex numbers can be represented with the polar coordinates (r, θ).

Now, let's return to the problem I posed above: x^4 + 1 = 0.

Let's factor this equation as: (x^2 + 1)(x^2 - 1) = 0.

So, x^2 + 1 = 0 and x^2 - 1 = 0. We know that *i* solves the first equation and so does -*i*. The second equation we already knew how to solve and its solutions are 1 and -1. So the entire solution set is 1, -1, *i* and -*i*.

What about the equation x^2 + *i* = 0? We could easily see that x = sqrt(*i*) and -sqrt(*i*).

But what exactly *is* sqrt(*i*)? Let's return to Euler's equation.

e^*i*x = cos(x) + *i*sin(x). We know that if x = pi, we get -1, but that's not too helpful. Let's try something else. Like x = pi/2.

e^*i*pi/2 = cos(pi/2) + *i*sin(pi/2) = 0 + *i*1 = *i*. So we see that e^*i*pi/2 = *i*. *This* is the useful quantity for evaluating the sqrt(*i*).

Sqrt(*i*) = *i*^1/2 = (e^*i*pi/2)^1/2 . Bringing the 1/2 power in, we get: e^*i*pi/4 .

So, we see that +/- e^*i*pi/4 are the solutions to x^2 + *i* = 0.

I think that should be a pretty decent introduction to complex numbers. What you should get from this is complex numbers are awesome.","1312160993"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","I think your question has been sufficently answered, but i'm going to point out that speed is relative. When you say ""99.9% of the speed of light"" (.999c) then you need to also say what the speed is relative to. Right now, you're standing still relative to yourself (duh). If you walk at 1m/s, you're going 1m/s relative to the ground. If you're walking 1m/s in the same direction as a car going 10m/s (both of you relative to the same ground), you're going 9m/s relative to the car. With slow speeds like this, relatice motion is simple. With speeds larger than .1c (rule of thumb) you need to take into account Lorentz' factor, which complicates your result somewhat. And when you use c to find Lorentz' factor, you get infinite, which incidentally explains your question. .999c gives a high number as Lorentz' factor, .9999c an even higher number, but 1c gives infinty.","1312161000"

So while you shouldn't beat yourself up for missing a run or shower, if you're thinking about going on that run or getting in the shower and not feeling up to it, just remind yourself that motivation follows action.
