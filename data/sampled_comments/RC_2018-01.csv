I did find the settings for the button but it still does nothing. I might just return it and try out an Intuos.

"sex","t5_2qh3p","1: that's fairly normal. The foreskin doesn't always roll back all the way behind the glans. Over time, if you gently roll it back, it should  be able to retract fully. If it doesn't get there by the time you're sixteen or so, being it you with your doctor, there's creams they can prescribe to help the process. But in the early teens it isn't unusual at all. It might phimosis, but it's a fairly minor case  so I wouldn't be worried yet, if at all.

2: it is supposed to be sensitive. If it is painful to touch gently, that's a lot over sensitive, I don't have a solid answer as to why because there's so many possibilities. I hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  I know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.

Cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, I really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower. But here's some basic guidance for that [gotta love the nhs](https://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/penis-health/Pages/how-to-wash-a-penis.aspx)

3: that's actually not a lot shorter than normal. 5 and 7/8 inch is the mathematical average world wide. And it's plenty for pretty much everything you'll need it to do. But, at 13 you aren't completely done growing yet. I wouldn't even pay attention to size at all in general, but if you're concerned (and most guys are), wait a few years. It isn't really finished until your late teens, though the growth won't be a lot.

4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. Your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.

But every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.

5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. Your reaction is up to you.  Most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. Yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. So doing it quick and only short glances is best. But curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  It isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).

But eventually you might want to let yourself chill a bit in locker rooms. It's one of those things you get used to. When you're an old fart like me, you'll be slumped on a bench at the end of a workout and  shower with your balls hanging loose and not caring at all. Nobody really does tbh.",1514764800

4: perfectly normal, particularly at your age. Your body hasn't ramped up production of prostate fluid yet, and you aren't primed for maximum effort since your body isn't quite where it needs to be for breeding.

But every guy is different, and the amount, force and consistency all change not only over years, but from one time to the next.

5: that one is a lot more complex to answer. Your reaction is up to you.  Most guys go through a phase of curiosity about other guy's development. Yeah, in most places it isn't cool to be blatant about it. So doing it quick and only short glances is best. But curiosity is pretty much a universal thing.  It isn't at all related to sexual preference (and even if it was, there's nothing wrong with being gay, bi or other).

I hate to say it, but it's one for your doctor.  I know that some intact guys have issues with over sensitivity in early puberty, but that's about it.

Cleaning under the foreskin is important, but with the pain issues, I really think you should talk to your doctor before you do more than rinse with warm water in the shower.

ALL LIFE was obliterated. Also taking in account that the swarm invaded US soil last, means that we can only be sure animals that lived on said US soil survived for sure. (survived meaning being save and secure inside ARTEMIS as little frozen embryos)

When talking about dogs and cats tho, well if GAIA would have just released them they would have become wild again and without APOLLO the first humans would probably have just seen them as a threat and never tried to turn them back into pets, since they had no idea they ever had been pets. They would just hunt them or kill them.

But we do know that many animals would have to be reintroduced by humans, but since APOLLO is pretty much gone that never happened.
Its by design.

Make a list of what you can/will do and what you can't/won't do.

Outline the plan - the next four weeks you'll show her how to adult, buy a planner, map out paying bills, etc.

Set firm boundaries, and practice phrases for saying no - ""that won't work for me"", ""that's not in the plan"", etc.

"unpopularopinion","t5_2tk0s","Black pigeon speaks gives interesting perspectives in a pseudo-theocratic sense. Pseudo, in this connotation, not being that  f a derogatory insult, just a way of saying it’s half theocratic and half conservative. If this is a bad interpretation of his work please correct me.

The decision to give suffrage to all human beings was quite an obvious decision with the western world. How it was advancing, not only economically but socially speaking, women were being more and more independent and autonomous, this ushered in a movement essentially along the lines of “If I’m being taxed I want a day in the vote” which makes a lot of sense given our history of “no taxation without representation.” 

Now you talked about how women often than not vote for mass immigration then “get raped en masse” by those immigrants. Despite the actual rates of immigration sexual violence being either overblown by people who just like to fear monger, or under blown by those who don’t want to think there are bumps in the road when it comes to this type of thing, that part really doesn’t matter, what matters is you said it best “women vote more.” 

They are involved more in the voting system, on average, compared to men. If you don’t like their decisions, you go out and vote.

2. Cleared my Cache folder and deleted localthumbcache.package

3. Had to go through the daunting task of sifting through my custom content and comparing it to a list of working/broken mods after the Pets update was released. After finding any problem files that were confirmed broken, I sadly had to delete that custom content. I'm on mobile right now. I'll edit with the link to the list when I get to my computer. [List of Broken Mods](http://forums.thesims.com/en_US/discussion/928106/broken-mods-cats-and-dogs-nov-2017/p1)

4. Downloaded Sims 4 Studio. After installing it, I used the program to repair my mods to be compatible with Pets update. 

a. Tools --&gt; Batch Fixes --&gt;CAS --&gt; Update CAS CC Pets Patch


b. Tools --&gt; Batch Fixes --&gt; Objects --&gt; Fix Objects for Cats &amp; Dogs Patch

5. In Origin, I used the ""repair"" button for my Sims Game. 

6. Double checked that I had the 64 bit version of The Sims installed to match my Operating System. 

7. Double checked that my game was running with the correct graphics card (my NVIDIA, instead of my Intel)

8. Restarted my computer.

9. Had to tweak some graphics settings in the game.

I realize both are very harmful, It just feels different. I’ve made some progress in therapy, but I guess I’m still at the point where I’ll think I sound crazy if I say he was sexually abusive.  It’s much easier to write these things out than to say them, so I’m hoping writing them will help make them easier to say. 

Thanks again for your encouragement!

"SkincareAddiction","t5_2tbbg","First and foremost, these are the products I have *recently* been using; I've become a little addicted to skincare after being prescribed medication for my cystic acne from my PCP that has been working.

*I am male and have oily, mildly sensitive skin with a lot of red areas around my face.  Skin color is fair brown*

**Products** (in no order)

1) Benzamycin Topical Gel Erythromycin 3%, BP 5%
2) La Roche-Posay Effaclar Purifying Foaming Gel Face Wash Cleanser
3) Dr. Lin's Daily Hydrating Gel (AM Moisturizer)
4) MIZON All in One Snail Repair Cream (AM/PM)
5) MIZON Snail Recovery Gel Cream (AM/PM)

**Routine** (Daytime)

1) Splash face with water and then use La Roche Gel Face Wash Cleanser

2) Apply Benzamycin topical gel to respective areas of redness and location of acne (cheeks, in between eyebrows, underneath eyes since I developed cysts there from wearing eyeglasses -- they have now left red acne marks)

3) Apply Dr. Lin Daily Hydrating Gel

4) *Sometimes* apply MIZON Snail Recovery Gel Cream

**Routine** (Night time)

1) Splash face with water and then use La Roche Gel Face Wash Cleanser

2) Apply Benzamycin topical gel

3) Apply Snail Recovery Gel Cream

4) Apply All in One Snail Repair Cream

Does this seem right to you?  For some reason, I feel uneasy about the order I am doing this, especially with steps 3 and 4 of the PM routine in regards to whether I should apply the Gel cream before or after the Snail moisturizer.

**ALSO** 

1)  Should I invest in a daily moisturizer with SPF as well?  I feel like I am using so many products right now for my face that are indeed moisturizers, but everyone else says to use moisturizer with SPF no matter what.

2)  After researching Vitamin C serum to help with my hyperpigmentation/redness/acne marks, I was wondering if this would be a good investment.

It is also important to note that ever since my appointment with my Doctor and utilizing these products for the last 3 days, I have noticed a huge difference in face smoothness and acne/redness reduction.

I know this was a long post but I am addicted now to making my skin feel and look as smooth as possible with the use of the right products.  Please offer any tips or advice that I could potentially use for the betterment of my acne and lifestyle.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","&gt; The man needs some good strategy, folks, to get out of this with a healthier relationship. Give him some. Telling him is wife is an idiot is unhelpful at best, idiotic at worst.

Except ignoring the problem, apologizing to the friend, and not bringing it up with the wife again (because ""you can't reason people out of a view they didn't reason themselves into"")...that's certainly *not* a ""healthier relationship"".

In a relationship with a partner I love, trust, and respect (and who I want to continue loving, trusting, and respecting), I wouldn't be OK with them thinking their friend's frequent pattern of sexual assault (with both me and others!) is ""no big deal"".

People in this thread are telling OP his wife is in the wrong, so that he doesn't feel like he's crazy for thinking she's in the wrong. Other than that, most of the advice is to be upfront and honest, and tell his wife he's not going to apologize for standing up to a sexual abuser. All of which is valuable for him to hear, and will *actually* help he and his wife get to a healthier, safer place in their marriage (or she'll obstinately stand by her friend/OP's abuser, at which point OP can decide if he wants to stay in a relationship with someone as toxic as that).

Brushing it under the rug, apologizing to the friend with a half-hearted request not to grope him again, and then just hoping for the best...that's not in any way healthy, for OP or for his marriage.",1514764812

The card is the secondary card and assigned to pci.stub so it doesn't get used until the VM starts. The MSI X399 BIOS doesn't use it.

And the Linux kernel on the host needs nomodeset otherwise the system will crash on boot so it doesn't get used here either.

If I don't pass nomodeset both card shows the xubuntu loading screen  animating (so I know the 2nd card works) during the startup then the secondary card goes black and the system crashes. From what I understand it's a bug with Nouveau on 10-series. I might not need nomodeset now that I installed the nvidia proprietary drivers.

But nouveau-driver issue aside I know the R7 260X card can activate and output a signal outside the VM.

Does the other motherboard BIOSes (even if temporarily) activate the secondary card? That could be what makes it work.

I agree with you that it's easy to say you would do the right thing in a similar scenario.  That being said, I just want to make it clear that the scene wasn't about cowardice so much as it was about buying time to get supplies.

She was also a guest of Obama Russian Ambassador Michael McFaul at a House of Representatives hearing on US policy toward Russia 5 days after the Jr. meeting.  

Browder – Former American who made a fortune in post-Communist Russia as a hedge fund manager, was expelled and his lawyer (Magnitsky) was imprisoned and died there (guessing tortured to death) because he was anti-Putin and exposing likely-true government looting and corruption.  Lawyer is namesake for the Magnitsky Act, which sanctioned some high-profile Russians in 2012.  He’s definitely politically well-connected in the US, despite giving up his citizenship in 1998 to avoid taxes.

You're special forces and you get sent to a situation, you don't go in wondering whether it's a prank or a genuine thing, you go in because there is shit going on. The forces were constantly fed information of the situation, and the latest information they have to work with is

1) There are 4 people in the house. 1 dead father, 1 mother and 1 younger brother incapacitated, and 1 older brother who is the aggressor.

2) Said aggressor killed his father, and doused the house with gasoline, ready to blow the place (along with the rest of his family) to smithereens at any moment


Upon breaking into the house, they see an adult show-up. With the information presented above, there is only one logical possibility, that being the murderer who is about to blow the whole place up. They know it won't be the hostage because he wasn't going anywhere, and if he did they'd have been updated of that new fact.

**What the hell do you expect the officer to do?**
--------------------
In the end this was nothing but a stupid prank turned deadly, and the shithead should get fucked in prison and rot for the rest of his life. The officer will be investigated, but chances are they'll find, under the assumed circumstances, what he did was likely the most logical choice, that is to kill 1 to save 2 (or more depending on the explosion's size).

But as a fellow college student, I've noticed that I tend to have worse skin (meaning cystic) near finals and midterms, and they go away or become less severe within a few weeks after. What's helped me deal with this is getting more sleep consistently, and trying to stay on top of my work.

And a bit busy right now with this thread https://np.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/7n5x2k/real_local_bitcoin_cash/. But list is coming soon (maybe in parts).

I will leave that with one of my most important quotes trading ""The market will find your personal weak spot, be it greed or fear, and it will exploit it"". Then pair that with a James Dines quote ""As a securities analyst I have to be in a state of position-less thinking"". Those two might be the most important quotes to most new traders!

And another James Dines theory, the wolfpack theory, which roughly states that things move in tandem that has a link. Cryptos is a big wolfpack, but also the top 10 cryptos is another wolfpack, and you can find hundreds of packs inside the cryptos, if you can identify the groups that move together, you can often find that once one start moving some will lag and then you can invest in them. It can be as simple as ""Oh the pattern is that all the ASIC related currencies move in a wolfpack"" or vice versa.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PnwQLFY60M This is outdated now in information but a lot of the details in his views of trading in his words are extraordinary.

"WWII","t5_2r4qh","the intermedate cartridge wasn't really the issue with the STG. really the germans had the ability to make a gun similar to the STG at the end of WW1. the issue was that most of the people in charge of arms development, and at the head of most militaries, didn't see a need for an intermediate weapon. think about where warfare had always taken place for the last couple hundred years, not in citys. but in fields, so a single bolt action, or semi auto was more than capable, then you had the SMG's which were more than adicate at close range. so in the minds of the Germans, and really most military's the idea of an Assault Rifle didn't make any sense at the time.

the issue is however WW2 changed all that. Warfare was now mobile, Battles did take place in close quarters. in was mobile warfare, suddenly having a squad with 2 sets of weapons, meant that both from a combat, and a supply side, was a huge issue, after all the American's Squads at the time had people with BAR, M1 garands, and M1A1 Thompson, and alter M1 Carbines. that's a humongous Supply headache. having replacements, ammo, cleaning kits have all kinds of issues.

or you could have just 1 type of weapon The AR. which is what happened. during Vietnam squads were made up of people using mostly the same weapon (M16/AK47), with 1 LMG gunner (M60).

the reason the STG didn't exist 20 years before it was designed, is because at the end of the day it wasn't needed for the battles that people were currently fighting.",1514764817

&gt; So it's often said, for example, that in order to apply statistical methods, your ""n"" (sample) should be at least 30

It is, but almost every time it's been said, it's pretty much complete nonsense.

&gt; What I wonder is, aren't principles like these 

You might say ""dubious rules of thumb with little justification given the way they're applied"".

&gt; hat I wonder is, aren't principles like these dependent on the properties of the research subjects themselves (e.g. whether you're conducting a research on animate or inanimate objects) or the ""N"" (the whole population/universe)? 

If we imagine some other rule (one with some better justification) then - as long as the assumptions under which the rule was derived apply (the model for the situation is suitable) - it doesn't matter what the source of the numbers is. The rules of probability don't change; what might change is the extent to which the particular thing you're using would be a reasonable model. 

Certainly the relative size of sample and population can be relevant (if you sample a large fraction of the population of interest, generally the resulting variances of estimated quantities are reduced) -- but this is a matter of choosing the relevant formula (the finite population one); again, that's a modeling consideration that's largely independent of the area of application - *whether* the model reasonably applies isn't independent of the area, but *if* it applies closely enough, the consequences of the mathematical reasoning don't depend on it beyond that assessment.

Of course, the importance/relevance of any eventual subject-matter conclusions may again be area-dependent.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","&gt; His season BABIP was .357, which isn't abnormal for someone who hits the ball as hard as he does. 

Yes it is. The guys who run high BABIPs are typically guys who are fast, hit a million line drives, or play in Coors.

Power guys like Judge don't run high BABIPs as a normal thing. Stanton is the closest thing to Judge and he has a career BABIP of .319 and was sub-300 the past three years.

&gt;You bring up Trout, but his BABIP this year was the lowest of his career since his rookie season. His career average is .355. 

Because both of them hit the same amount of line drives, and there is a reason Trout can run a high BABIP given his speed.

&gt; My point is that Steamer is projecting his BABIP to regress to the mean and drop to .319, but I'm not sure that's a sound prediction, because he literally hits balls harder than anyone else in baseball

Because that's the way BABIP works. You'd expect someone with a very low BABIP to regress to the mean too, just as someone with a high BABIP unless they've shown a history of being a high/low guy in the majors.

&gt;  and it's not like .357 is an unsustainable BABIP level for an elite hitter.

BABIP is not a skill itself, like hitting the ball hard or plate discipline, and Judge isn't the type of skillset to do that.

A guy could hit the ball harder than anyone else, but if he only hits grounders, he'll have an extremely low BABIP.

&gt; K% and BABIP are completely uncorrelated.

More strikeouts means fewer balls in play means fewer opportunities for good/bad luck on ball distribution.

&gt; One thing that can contribute to that is speed, and another is how hard you hit the ball.

Then why don't most other guys who hit the ball as hard run BABIPs that high?

Player	Exit Velo	Career BABIP

Aaron Judge 94.9 0.348

Nelson Cruz	93.2	0.309

Joey Gallo	93.1	0.263

Miguel Sano	92.4	0.362

Khris Davis	92.2	0.280

Giancarlo Stanton	91.9	0.317

Paul Goldschmidt	91.4	0.354

Ryan Zimmerman	91.4	0.311

Yasmany Tomas	91.3	0.325

The standouts are Judge, Sano, and Goldschmidt.

Sano has 1,300 career PA so sample size is still a bit of an issue and he has history of running a high BABIP.

Goldschmidt is a very good line drive hitter and is one of the premier all fields hitters in the league (opposite and centerfield balls run higher BABIP than pulled).

Goldy batted ball distribution:

Pull:37.1 %

Center: 35.4 %

Opp: 27.5%

Judge:

Pull: 42.0 %	

Center: 31.0 %	

Opp: 27.0 %	
		

I suppose we'll just agree to disagree, but I don't think Judge is going to run a high BABIP consistently.",1514764818

You mentioned you’re 45. I was 49 when she left, and I didn’t think I would need to start over at that age. I started dating again a few months ago and met an absolutely incredible woman. We’ve been together for three months and are starting to talk long term. We have a connection that I never had with my ex, and I would gladly experience all of the pain all over again if it meant meeting this new woman, not to mention getting to a better place after the separation.

"Warframe","t5_2urg0","A well crafted plague zaw with a riven that can replace two mods is pretty much endgame for melee right now. Reason is they can reliably run Blood Rush, Condition Overload, and Maiming all in one or some variation there in. Add in the arcanes and they are super versatile.

I have been running Keewar + Seekalla + Ekwana Ruhang II and can pretty much melt anything. Range wasn't as important to me as was consistency so I went with the following...

* Primed Pressure Point
* Blood Rush
* Condition Overload
* Prime Fever Strike
* Volcanic Edge
* Drifting Contact
* Primed Fury
* Riven w/ +Cold +Status Change +Slide Crit Chance (The riven essentially merges Vicious Frost and Maiming Strike into one mod)

All that combined I get Slash, Impact, Puncture, Viral, Gas, and Cold for Condition Overload. Crit galore with Blood Rush and the Maiming. I can stun enemies and distance proc viral with Arcane Epidemic. I have solid range, solid speed, and a spin attack worth close to 2800. You simply can't go wrong.

Someone has manipulated this person to such a degree that they have now found their calling to making claims like ""pizzagate is debunked"".  As if it could be an impossibility in our world and time.  So much so that they feel the uncanny need to be online to convey to people that it *IS* impossible for this to be true.  Totally impossible.  No previous examples.  Cut and dry, just cannot happen.

Those people have been turned.  Shills at least know what they do and some are aware and upfront about it.  These types of people are worse.  They don't even understand they're being used as a tool.  Even if this guy is a shill, he poses as a ""regular person"" online.....giving a totally legit opinion!!  They don't even understand they're doing the dirty work of potential perpetrators to one of the most serious crimes in our world.  The one that gets you killed in prison for being one or defending one.

That's how fucking backwards this mindfuckery is.  So many do-gooders out there who believe in what do and what they participate in, that they end up protecting the people who do the most damage.  This could be a shill, but its better to call people out as fools for possibly believing it cannot be done or has not been done by people in power positions.

Eg. Jeff Epstein.   (totally not a kid fucker......totally.  Totally doesn't have people in positions making sure he gets more of the same.

Because their backline usually has 2-3 people, each with their own abilities to peel for the most part, they will shred you up fast or run away. Also, since you just used your jump, it's on cooldown. So if you get in health trouble, you are *really* in trouble, and it might get your Mercy killed too if she tries to heal you while you are deep in enemy territory.

A lot of Winston is pressuring/harassing with that Tesla gun at the opponents front/mid line, believe it or not. You're much stronger here as (I hope) your healers are nearby, and DPS and the second tank on your team are also right there pushing ahead.

Backline is more for when everyone is distracted and you spot the weak targets, or you want to really take care of Widow, Genji and Tracer. It's kind of used like an Ultimate - you don't do Genji's Ult when everyone is looking at you. You do it when everyone is distracted. Same for Winston's backline jump.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;  you have a replicator gun. You walk into a pizza shop, point it at a pizza on the counter, and replicate it. 

Thank you for clarifying your argument! This is 100% how I see piracy, and also why I see it as perfectly fine. I guess we have different views on what morality is. Yours seems to be that anything you benefit from without working, is immoral. I think that if technology provides a way to replicate something and provide that benefit to the maximum amount of people, then that is very wonderful and good, not evil or immoral. In your above description, we could use technology to feed every single starving child on the planet and end world hunger, without taking anything from anyone.

If I had a replica gun I would absolutely replicate a pizza!

Only the truly greedy and evil would complain that everyone gets to enjoy his pizza instead of just himself. I guess at the bottom of it all, it's just different ways of how we see the world and I don't think we'll come to an agreement.

&gt; I challenge you to do creative work of any kind at all. Make a video game or write a song or something and then tell me copying is moral when you can't sell your product because everyone just pirates it. Your mind will change oh so quickly.

Already am. And have been! I've published a book and am an independent video game programmer. I also release a message in my description saying I don't want anyone to miss out on the content, and if they're unable to purchase it, they can contact me for a free copy. About 1 person contacts me for a free copy of every 20 copies I sell. I have NO problem knowing people are enjoying my work without working for it. It actually brings joy to my heart.

Why do people buy it instead of pirating it or asking for it for free? Because they want to support me and continue working on it. The same reason I buy indie video games - I want to support these people who work on these things I enjoy. Not because I have to. Not because my morality is demanding it. If piracy were free and open, people would still support the talented ones who create things they care about. Only the giant-ass publishing companies would suffer, and that would be wonderful. Maybe they'd stop producing and allow small artists (like the ones you keep saying are hurting) to finally get noticed.

This is the same opinion of most creative artists that I've read, if you do a google search you'd see the same. Even big-shot artists like Lady Gaga say that piracy helps her career. She makes more from touring than from music sales, and piracy only serves to spread around her music and create more fans. Not saying you should get your moral compass from Lady Gaga, I'm just saying that it's mostly the CEOs of publishing companies who care about nothing more than the bottom line that scream about piracy destroying all creative art - not artists themselves.

There will always be people cooking more pizza's, not because they want to become billionares, but because they enjoy cooking pizza and enjoying knowing others enjoy that pizza. Don't let Disney's propaganda fool you that piracy is the end of modern entertainment as we know it.

Edit: Not that this should play any part in morality, but in analysis of most indie video game and small artist song productions, studies have shown that piracy increases revenue for the artist in almost every case.",1514764828

It’s another thing to do, which I’ll admit sometimes feels overwhelming.

It helps me get a better idea of what’s going on and it’s a one time purchase. It isn’t invasive - I just scoop some spit from under my tongue onto the lens. I do it the morning before I brush when I’m WTO, but you can do it any time of day when you haven’t eaten or drank anything for a few hours. 

I made a post in r/TTC_PCOS with some pictures of my ferns. It’s hard to take a a clear picture. I think it took me seeing each one (none, partial, and full) before I was marking it correctly. I’m not sure how to link to it on mobile but it’s in my post history.

While I do think the MBT/KPZ-70 and T-64A should be at BR 9.3, I also accept that it prob won't happen for a while and that Gaijin always takes thier sweet time addressing balance things. The main arguement before about top tier was that it was point and click and armor didn't matter. They introduce the T-64A (and Cheif Mk.10 to an extent) and now the main complaint is that they can use their armor (against BR 8.3 and lower tanks) and they should be uptiered so they can't use their armor anymore. At that point I wonder why exactly introduce these tanks then.",1514764829

I am usually overlooked and not taken seriously and underestimated due to me being soft spoken. Also people misjudge my trying to stay calm and focused as being aloof. I have actually been let go of a job because I seemed “bored”. It was my first day and I was freaking out internally the whole day but somehow looked bored. It majorly sucks and I would never wish social anxiety on anybody. I can’t even list here without writing a book how many opportunities I’ve missed and how much better my life would have turned out if I didn’t have to suffer every day of my life with this.

 For our trip this coming spring, we spent about $640 total on intra-Europe flights. Dublin to Bucharest, Bucharest to Budapest, and Budapest to Prague. Not quite as stellar of a deal as last time, but still really reasonable to get flights averaging a little over $100 per person.

You seem to be contradicting yourself here: you say that you are only romantically attracted to women and androgynous people who lean feminine, but then you say that being feminine has nothing to do with your attractions and it is only due to gender. So which is it? What qualities do women possess that you are romantically attracted to that you cannot find in men? 

And why is it that men intimidate you? You seem to be making an exception for feminine or androgynous men, so clearly not all men do. Seems you have some sexist biases that you need to work out with yourself, and you do have the ability to make the choice to do so. It’s not something you or anyone else has no control over. Try looking at men and women as unique individuals instead of as single homogenous groups. 

Whether a human being can make an emotional connection with another human being has nothing to do the individuals gender or even your sexual orientation. The only thing that seems to be in your way is your own personal biases and prejudices against men. I feel bad for you. Best of luck getting over that. ",1514764835

The OCD friars tend to be a bit stricter and have more of a contemplative focus than the O.Carm friars.  There are significantly more OCD nuns than O.Carm.  Most canonized Carmelite Saints are OCD as well.

There are also a couple of communities of O.Carm hermits in the US that attempt to live the Rule of Saint Albert in a more literal way.

There are also the Carmelite Monks (M.Carm) of Wyoming.  They are a fairly new diocesan community.  They are strictly cloistered and seem to be much more severe than any Carmelite friars at least in the US.  They also use traditional liturgy and Gregorian chant.

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","Those types of issues crop up even with season long incentives, too.  I remember a story about Dan Marino (I think) who missed an incentive in his contract by throwing one too many interceptions, and the one too many was on a Hail Mary try at the end of a half.  And another way to look at is for every game where a RB is sitting on 98 yards at the end, there's probably another game where he gets stuffed up most of the game, but gets ~26 carries and bursts a big one late when it's largely decided.  It cuts both ways.

&gt; What about if you decide to give the backup RB carries...are you doing it to avoid paying the incentive, or trying to keep your RB1 from getting injured?

In general, the coach is making that decision, and the coach is more concerned with winning and keeping guys healthy than in what bonuses they hit.  I'm sure coaches are aware of stuff like that, but I don't think it's a huge conflict of interest as the money isn't coming out of the coach's pocket, and he's not writing up the incentives anyway.

"hearthstone","t5_2w31t","A well thought out response, the majority of which I agree with. Here are a few things to consider though:

1) Keleseth, Bonemare, Scalebane, Patches, and now Creeper are all offenders in the meta with the priests, but if I had to wedge a minuscule gap between them and priests, almost all of the aggro/tempo enablers are neutral cards. Shadowstep specifically for Keleseth and a couple borderline fair cards like Druid of the Swarm are some of the very few exceptions to that rule. However many of the high end control enablers are class specific. So *anyone* can play some aggro variant but not every class can play a strong control deck.

2) I did play aggro paladin up to rank 2 and gave up the dream for legend this month but that largely has to do with my lack of patience rather than the fault of the deck. What would you suggest I tech in to counter priest though? Outside of Doomsayer, Dirty Rat, and Street Trickster, the cheapest minion I can play with 6+ health to play around Dragonfire cost 4 mana and none are particularly aggro-centric. For minions with over 2 attack to play around Madness &amp; Horror, there's very few that would actually be beneficial.

3) ""after they've flooded their board for the third, the fourth time"" I really want to understand this. Except for specifically paladin post-K&amp;C, what aggro deck can flood the board multiple times before turn 5 or 6? Even if every minion comes from half a card (e.g. pirate summoning Patches, Fire Fly giving a copy, etc) and we consider a flood only 4 minions that's 6 cards at least. In reality it would probably be 7 or 8 since it's not always 2 for 1 summons. That's every card you draw by turn 5. Even if the priest has to use 3 or 4 or even 5 cards to clear all of that, you're still left with multiple cards in hand and a hero power to undo my aggression. Paladin is specifically a problem due to just how insanely strong Call to Arms and Divine Favor are. It's a paladin issue, not an aggro one.

4) I don't think Creeper is ""healthy"" for the meta either. It's why for almost all of KotFT expansion and the last half of Ungoro almost all I did outside of getting rank 5 was play arena because the power level is considerably lower and it allowed for superior play to be rewarded. But so long as things like Psychic Scream exist (which by the way is the one removal that doesn't even trigger it), we need powerful aggro recovery tools as well. But, yes, I'd prefer a meta without either.",1514764842

It's not like OP only posted ""Hey I got my GF a $1.3k ring but she wants a $10k one. Wat do guise?!""

No one is saying it's a crime to have desires. No one is saying she should hide what her desires are. Offering these as defenses are so inane they are basically insults to the people you're responding to. The point that so many people are trying to make is that *our desires and how we express them indicate deeper things about who we are and how we perceive things.* They don't exist in a vacuum, and they can be indicative of poisonous, sexist, unreasonable, etc etc views on relationships, marriage, life, whatever.

Like I myself am perfectly ""entitled"" to want a 6 packed, 10-inch dicked, 6-figure making husband that never watches porn and sets up a shrine to me in our closet that he prays to daily, but this is probably indicative of me having some kind of narcissistic god-complex.

The way OP's gf approached him, crying because he didn't offer up the properly priced token for her love, is indicative of a mindset that will probably poison other areas of their relationship, and they would be wise to either get therapy to work out the differences, or part ways since they clearly have very different ideas of what marriage is and means.",1514764845

It's an assumption made based on available data.

RO and PR are my favorite games but that's not the generally accepted cup of tea, honestly I  cant think of a mix that would work. I can tell you right now that an RO2/PR mashup with WW2O type mechanics would win hundreds of thousands of players over, but you're certaintly not going to get a COD playerbase and that mass is what you need to make a game like that fun ",1514764849

Personally, if mentors, story, side missions, etc, remained unlocked then I wouldn't really have anything to actually DO when I make a new character.  It'd just be make character then grind to max level.  I mean...that's technically what it is now but since we have to replay everything it's at least a *variety* of activities during the grind to get to max level as opposed to just hopping right into EM16/17 and grinding those even more than we already do.

Okay, let's clear something up. The poverty rate in Alabama is 18.5%. That's pretty darn bad. But it's not like they're without company. Portugal, for instance, has a nationwide poverty rate of 18.6%...and you bet your bottom dollar that most of the wealth of that country is located in a few areas.

"premed","t5_2rlp9","Another army medic here.

Looked deeply into the army medical programs because i do enjoy being in the army, and there are a lot of them.
 
So from the easiest to most difficult to get into

First is 68 series mos.
Im a 68w (general medic) with an f2( flight paramedic) 
68 series is enlisted, you just do wellish on the asvab and you can get a 68 job. They have lab techs, they have dental, they have phych, they got it all. 
Pros: easy to get into.
Cons: low pay, long hours, basically everything but niche jobs suck.

The army nursing program.
Go become a nurse and an officer on the armies dime.
Not a bad program, get accepted to nursing school and submit a packet. Can be entery level (hpsp), or done once enlisted (green to gold).
Pros: school paid for, less nonsense
Cons: a whole different bag of nonsense.

Inter service physician assistant program.
This is actually the hardest program by the numbers to get into. 
Need certain prereqs, but if accepted go to school (military school on post in uniform) and receive a masters degree from the university of Nebraska 
Pros: good school. Great emplyment opportunities both in and out of the service.

Health professions schlorship program (HPSP)
Wanna do any other health care profession? Pt, MD, DO, Vet, ect?
Drop a packet with a recruiter, and get into a school.
Pros: alot
Cons: even more nonsense.

There's so much about this that i Don't have time to type, but there are health care recruiters everywhere. So go to your local recruiting office and ask to speak to one about your options.",1514764853

I would wait on buying Project cars 2 as many people apparently are having weird glitches and bugs like flickering and many penalty bugs. 

Assetto Corsa at $20 with the DLC is I think a better buy than PC1. PC1 is just not polished enough overall comparatively. You'd think they learn in PC2 but its just as unpolished as PC1 somewhat with all the bugs I hear.

You computer setup is much better than mines and the games run fine for me at about medium setting. I do get constant reprojection at 45fps in races with more than 5 cars because my rx580 is just not that powerful. Doing time attacks and practice laps  I get constant 90fps",1514764854

"books","t5_2qh4i","I've never been a horror nut, but a nosleep story by the name of ""I went hiking with my class, it didn't end so well"". It's about a kid who goes on a backpacking trip out to a remote cabin. The kid is a bit of a loner, and keeps to himself. Late at night, the kid has to use the restroom, so he does, but opens a window. The morning comes, and its severely cold. No one is awake, with further investigation, he finds his classmates and chaperones dead. He hikes out to get a signal, and calls the cops. When he's returning back he notices a ring around the cabin where no snow had laid on the ground. I don't feel this is the scariest because of the content of the story, but because of how it connects to me. I camp and backpack a lot, and such as other edgy teens, distance myself.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","I have a somewhat Instagram famous friend (165k followers) and hang out with him enough I feel I can answer these. His content is solidly outdoors/beautiful hipster friends lifestyle and he is unique in that what made him popular is the depth, relatability and quality of his captains. He actually got a book deal after an 18 month trip and now is a bona fide travel writer (and he has a ready made buying audience in his IG followers).

1. He takes his photos, or any of his also IG famous photographer friends. He always gives photo credit to the photographer if not his own.

2. He’s kind of always hanging out with beautiful people and doing amazing things outdoors with other hipsters so the scene isn’t staged but he and others put considerable effort into getting the right shot. He also has a steady backlog of older photos h can always post. 

3. He doesn’t use any software to get followers or likes and barely uses hashtags. He gets likes and followers bc he’s always with and tagging other famous people and his captions are ace. And he has enough followers now that people are always tagging their friends to read his posts.

4. He doesn’t honestly have to try to get a lot of visibility with his posts but he does spend a lot of time and energy writing his content and curating his photos.

5. I’ve seen one get only a few thousand likes instead of the usually 5-10K and he was a little affected by that. He certainly has a “brand” and a voice he feels the need to uphold.",1514764858

Protesters burn building and cars down all the time in the civilized world, guess how often the own government decides that means its ok to gun down people?

More fear mongering from the Islamist followers, its the only way they can try to keep support. Cumskins will never take control of Iran.

I'll contribute a few.

Many people think that [*Battle Cry of Freedom*](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/battle-cry-of-freedom-james-m-mcpherson/1100460413?ean=9780195168952) is the best one-volume history.  

I'm a big fan of Potter's [*Impending Crisis*](https://s-usih.org/2017/08/roundtable-reflections-on-david-potters-the-impending-crisis-part-1/) since you quickly find yourself in conversations about the reasons for the war.

Lots of people (including me) have enjoyed Foote's [*Civil War*](https://www.amazon.com/Civil-War-Volumes-1-3-Box/dp/0394749138).  He tells a good story.  (But a caution: professional historians seem to me to say that sometimes the desire to tell a good story can obscure the history, a bit.)

Finally, I have personally enjoyed the video series [American Civil War](https://www.thegreatcourses.com/courses/american-civil-war.html) by Gallagher, a professor at Univ of Va.

"vfx","t5_2qhfw","I've had some success object tracking using the manual tracking in Blender from a single camera, but it's tedious and you need to have accurate camera notes or the solver freaks out.  It's not always going to work, either. My big concern is that you've said white circular markers - does that mean, like, a single band around the arm or something? If so, I doubt you'll get enough useful information from that to actually try for object tracks. I've only really seen it done when you have enough points to get some degree of accuracy. Potentially, if you could track it accurately enough, you could parent bones to the track and get a rough set of animation data as a starting point which you would then finesse manually, I think.

Please note I'm only really somewhere between hobbyist/semi-professional at best, so I'm not super knowledgeable, but that would be the approach I would consider. But I wouldn't shoot a frame without testing it first and planning everything out in pre-production, because things like motion tracking seem to be pretty specific to get working, let alone making it look great.

Edit: may have misunderstood how you did the markers, very tired when I initially read that. Give it a shot in blender perhaps with the manual tracking - I'm not sure how well it'll go, but I've had some success with it in the past.

If I were you, I'd be fucking pissed because he's expressing some blatant disrespect for both you and your bf.


If dad communicated his reasoning maybe you and bf wouldn't have necessarily agreed but could defer to his judgment. Your dad is still the parent of your little sister after all.  

Regardless it's the adult thing to discuss the matter and for dad to give them back to bf so maybe he'll have an opportunity to resell the VIP tickets. That's more respectful at least. 

Just completely utterly rude, childish and chauvinistic. Some old folks need to grow up out of that kind of bullshit stoic chauvinism.

I've done research and while I've only been at this since November 1st, (ok had a set back for 3 days during Christmas) my biggest struggle has been making sure I'm getting enough fat in my diet. In order for your body to start burning fat for energy, you have to eliminate sugars and really minimize your carb intake. I always have avocados at home to eat with my meals. Intermittent fasting is another great way to help with weight loss. I did have a stall after my initial few lbs loss, however my clothes felt a lot looser. Once your body starts burning your fat residuals, water fills the fat cells which takes up less space. So you may not see a huge change in the scale, but you can notice changes. However, if you're dehydrated, your body will retain water. Drinks lots and lots of water! If you have a fit bit, you can log your water intake and set a goal. Or, download a free app for your phone and set timed reminders for yourself. I find it helps if you have a water bottle that holds say, 20oz of water, and set a goal for yourself daily. Having water on hand at all time makes it a lot easier. All i drink is coffee and water. Best of luck; don't get discouraged! Keep at it :) ",1514764863

"piano","t5_2qnw8","The first problem is in measure one. The first chord is fine, but the second chord is Gm7. Instead of doubling the G in the right hand, that should be an F. So from the bottom up, G F Bb. In measure two, that chord is F/A, so the right hand part should be C on top, and F below it. The A in the bass is correct. 

In measure 2 on count three. What that chord actually is is F13. In the right hand, from the top down, the notes are: D A Eb. The left hand bass note is just an F. The chord is just a Bb in the left hand, not the Bb and F that you wrote. Same thing in measure 6 and 7.

In measure 8 you put a Bb below that Eb. I believe that's incorrect. It's just an Eb in the left hand. Generally speaking, your root is going to be the lowest note.

It looks good after that part. I would probably notate things differently, but you're hearing the pitches, which is important. 

In measure 26, that F7 chord again is an F13 chord. The low F is right, but the F an octave above it shouldn't be there. So in the left hand, it's just F. In the right hand, top down, you should have: A Eb D. If you listen very closely, you can hear that Eb and D a half-step apart. That dissonance gives it that jazz sound.

In measure 29, you have Db and F in both hands. There should also be an Ab in there (the 5th of the chord). That goes between the two hands. Same with the next measure.

"Greyhounds","t5_2sqf9","I have two hounds - here are some thoughts and observations in addition to the good advice in the thread: 

1. Control: The extent of your control of an animal is the leash. This dog is not a robot - it is a sentient being that makes its own decisions. You can TRAIN, but ultimately responding to commands is even voluntary. You will never have ""control"" over your dog's mind and instincts. You are the animal's leader, not the animal's operator. 

2. Food: If your dog is underweight it shouldn't be surprising he is food obsessed. A starved human being will operate differently than a fed one. Since his interest is waning now his eating habits might be stress-impacted.  

3. Dogpark: We learned our Sade does not like other dogs. Wife and I had to realize that the vision of her happily frolicking at a dog park was something WE wanted, rather than something SHE wanted. (Reference #1 here). 

4. Greyhounds are weird: Sadie will ""statue"" sometimes when she walks. Just freezes in place and won't move. I learned to accept this is not a challenge to my authority - maybe she senses something I don't. Don't try and have a ""battle of wills."" Animals are superstitious. For example,  if someone came out of a ""similar"" looking door and beat the crap out of Tim he might now be afraid of doors. Point is he's not doing it to spite you. Sade walks nicely by my side, I have come to accept that if she tells me she really doesn't want to go down a path, we just go somewhere else. 

5. They are even weirder. It took almost a YEAR for our boy to really warm up to us and show us his personality. 

Best of luck whether you decide to keep or return this guy. It sounds like a rough pup for a first-time owner but not necessarily insurmountable. ",1514764866

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","I think it's the 'born again' mentality. Many of these 'asshole atheists' are new atheists leaving their communities of faith and indoctrination. They feel they have to come out hardcore and swinging to prove they are no longer like them. It's like someone who never believed becoming a believer. Everything is then about Jesus or Allah or whatever and get very personal when talking about it, because they wrap so much of their own personal identity into this new thing. They have to show that not only where they wrong with their thinking before, but anyone who thought like that is also wrong, and perhaps even complicit in the evil they feel they have just left. 

It tends to die off after a couple of years for most. Others, it never leaves them, though they may no longer be atheist/believer and have moved on to the next issue that they can attach their personal identity to. 

Another example, the 'reformed gay' who is now straight. They become hard core bigots against what they were to ensure they never slip up and fall back into those old patterns. Or the 'newly out gay' who was raised in a religious household and is violently (metaphorically) opposed to the religion they were surrounded by and project that feeling onto everyone else who is remotely religious.

If I understand correctly, you could have it rebuilt for ~$1500. I'd recommend not even touching the trans, not even for a fluid change, until it finally goes, then making upgrades while it's being rebuilt, and maintaining it religiously from then on. As it sits, you don't know its history, so assume that the truck has been beaten hard, and is still running the same fluid and filter it came with from the factory. With this being the case, you don't want to risk knocking any particulate deposits loose by changing the fluid, because those will kill your trans very quickly. When it finally goes, invest in a good aftermarket trans cooler, the bigger the better. The stock trans cooler is notoriously inadequate for use in a half-ton pickup.",1514764868

If the meet and greet is going well, and we start getting comfortable: what are some good and bad experiences you're comfortable sharing on SA, what do you do as an occupation, if the SD has a family... I'll ask if they are comfortable sharing a little bit about their personal life (i.e. dead bedroom, how long they've been married, if they have kids, if they have pets, etc. it really will depend how comfortable we get)... I don't ask personal questions unless our conversation starts getting deep lol.

I haven't run into a ""single"" SD yet, but I guess a good question is why pay and ""sugar"" when they can find other ways to date for free?

Ultimately, ask all questions you're curious about and that will help you make the best decision to move forward; whether, it becomes an arrangement or not.",1514764868

If you are increasing the weight then you are changing things. For cardio you can change it up by going for longer and thus doing more, or going faster for the same amount of time and thus doing more.

be prepared for alot more JF isn't against ethnostates by any means.

"aspergers","t5_2rm6u","He hides his true feelings from his co-workers, and releases them in the virtual world, forcing his dominance on the digital clones as a form of unjustified revenge and outlet of frustration. What drives him to do that, is how he's being treated in the office. Constantly talked down to, shittalked behind his back, getting pressured by his ""boss"". He's unable to deal with it because he lacks the social skills and the confidence to do so. Either he doesn't have the guts to fight back as a fear of social rejection, or he's just plain naive (which some Aspergers tend to be). Since he's the mastermind behind the company's software, one may consider him to be an expert the field of programming, likely his special interest. His talent gets taken advantage of, and he doesn't receive the credit he should get. This is not too uncommon in the real world either.

If you're entering China from another country, I strongly suggest you do not bring in seeds. That is expressly forbidden, and can get you in some serious trouble.  Invasive species are a very serious ecological and economic issue.

I'm also a cook, so I know what you want.   But you have to adjust to the local environment.  You'll be able to find most of what you need at the local market (go to the traditional (farmers') markets to get your produce),

For herbs and spices:  Check if there's a Metro in the area you'll be.  They have a very good selection (at really good prices).  If you want to grow your own herbs, look on Taobao.

Finally... You're a cook.  a) find local alternatives to what you usually use b) toss out your old recipes and learn to cook with what's available.  I cooked American, Mexican. Italian, and German foods ""with Chinese characteristics"". My Jambalaya, quesadillas, lasagna, and chili was slightly different, but just as delicious.",1514764871

It's a pain to comment there, though. I had to edit one comment 4 times because I wrote, first ""sonofabitch"" so they had a problem with the use of ""bitch"" so I changed it to ""sonofagun"" and then they got mad because the ""ofagun"" part contained the word ""fag"" in it, so then I changed it to something else entirely, but apparently something I said was ableist, so that one got deleted, too. It was really frustrating, so even though I'm no longer banned from there, I don't even comment since there's so many hoops to jump through.

Edit: Oh yeah! I remember why I was banned from /r/LateStageCapitalism! It's because I posted in certain ""controversial"" subs like /r/defranco, /r/h3h3_productions, /r/JonTron, /r/Destiny and /r/SubredditDrama.

"books","t5_2qh4i","You’ve made four different, very disparate points. I’ll address them in order:

1) Can you define the purpose of reading so I can understand why you think the goal of reading more books can be considered “counter productive?”This is just a guess, but, I’d say that you have a relationship with the books that you love, and want these book-counters to have the same experience that you do. While this is a wonderful goal that I applaud, it is a limited, and short-sighted idealization of reading. The reality is that I hate a quarter of the books I read. I have serious issues with half of them. I make a limited connection with some of the remaining, but never seek out another work from the same author. But, a handful over the last 35 years have really stuck with me, and I return to them again and again. 

The point is, I didn’t know what I liked until I read. Not just one or two, but lots of books. If I’d stopped reading when I came across the first book I hated, I wouldn’t have become an English teacher. From that perspective, how can reading more books be missing the point?

2) There’s a problem with the logic of your video game scenario: No one is forcing them to read. They made the goal for themselves.  If they’re like most people who make resolutions, they’ll give up by February. But, if they keeping working to achieve their goals, they will experience a multitude of different books. They’ll love some and hate others, but they may learn something about writing, about underlying motivations, about human struggle, the human condition, or even about themselves. I’ve learned all these things, and more, from books I hated. 

3) The video game scenario is relevant to students being forced to read books in school. So, if someone forced you to play 100 video games, you might hate most of them, discover a few that were a joy to play and a relief from the tedium of the other 95%. Would you then  be likely to find out who created those games you loved and see if they made more? That’s what people do with all sorts of media (movies, poetry, comedy, music, etc).  Just because you hate one doesn’t mean you give up on the medium or the genre. I hate Jeff Dunham. That doesn’t mean I give up on comedy. I hate horror films. It doesn’t mean I stop watching movies. Why does this logic only apply to reading?

4) I suspect your main gripe is that “this subreddit seems to be overrun with [book-counters]...” 

Here’s my point: you want the book-counters to have meaningful, purposeful connections to books. They can’t have those if they don’t read. If making a goal gets them reading, and sustains them beyond the many books they will inevitably feel apathetic about, dislike, and even hate, them why are we gate-keeping this trend? 

Do we, as a book reading community, have aspirations of encouraging people to love reading and books? If so, it seems counterproductive to tell those who are trying to read more that that they’re doing it wrong. 

A better response would be, “that’s great that you read 30 books this year. Tell us about your favorite one, why you loved it, and what you learned!”",1514764874

No one who bought their own pc talks like you either.  And when I say bought their own pc, I don't mean bought it with Christmas and allowance money. 

I don't blame people one bit for playing on consoles. A decent PC is expensive as hell with graphics card and CPU prices right now. A decent gtx-1070 goes for over 450 bucks. A brand new i5-7600K is 240 bucks minimum and that's without a motherboard. You're at 700 bucks without a motherboard, ram, CPU cooler, fans, case, a power supply, hard drive, CD drive, etc. You're talking well over a grand right now just to buy a pc that will still be decent for playing games by the end of next year.

(OOC: The Draconic Trials: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/StrawHatRPG/comments/6nvlqj/part_1_we_the_people/dqjc8z0/))


Rosli wrestled off her sweatshirt as sweat began to collect along every crevice of her body. It stuck persistently to her skin, and it wasn’t until she was in just her tank top that she felt any sort of relief in the decimated lava landscape. When she was a bit more comfortable, with her sweatshirt tied firmly around her waist, Rosli and Eis progressed forward. They explored along the ring of rock, picking their way carefully in case the ground wasn’t stable, all the while Rosli pondered where dragons would exist in such a place. She thought of their reptilian nature and decided heat was their best bet at locating the beasts. Leading down into the fiery pit, Rosli noticed a descending path that hugged the hole’s edge, the rusty-brown rock sizzling as it perspired in the heat too. *Down we go,* she thought, moving forward with apprehension. Every part of her groaned with the heat, and she glanced over at her massive wolf who was panting furiously. His fur was plastered to his body with sweat, giving him an emaciated look, and Rosli felt her heart squeeze. His gaze was gentle, trusting, and Rosli knew she couldn’t put the wolf’s life in danger. He meant too much to her, and she would protect what she cared about. “Go back to the bottom of the mountain and wait for me,” Rosli instructed him, giving him a small pat. Then, she formed a new pair of ice wings on the creature’s back. At first, he lingered, staring intently at Rosli. “Go Eis, I’ll be okay. I’ll see you soon.” The wolf seemed to understand before Rosli watched him decend the mountain, his large white form disappearing behind the rusty-brown cluster of rocks and earth that lay around her. *I hope I can do this without him* Rosli thought, before moving toward the path that would lead her downward. 

Before she could take her first steps downward, stepping over a large crack in the Earth, Rosli noticed something strange seeping from the ground. From the crevice, a red goo gushed, growing as more and more began to pool. It grew upward too, until a red sphere formed before her. When the slime opened its eyes, it was as large as she was, standing at 5 feet. It glowed an odd red, its mouth seeping lava as it smiled tauntingly at her. Rosli reacted quickly by firing a pair of ice shard daggers into the creature’s eyes, causing it to shriek hysterically. Its slimy skin sizzles when they penetrated, but otherwise, simply engulfed her ice effortlessly. After a moment’s pause, the creature’s eyes were back too, the slime completely unharmed. With a sigh, Rosli decided to try something bigger, and with a simple stomp of her foot erupted a thick iceberg spike from the ground. The ice grew quickly, branching like the ends of a tree as a dozen spikes drove into the slime and to the other side of it. Once again, the creature roared out, its body trembling. To Rosli’s interest, she could see the inside of the slime solidifying as her ice worked its way inside the strange creature, causing havoc from the interior. Next, Rosli stooped to tear her icy spike from the ground before thrusting it upward like the hilt of a blade. The imbedded ice sliced clean through the slime’s body, leaving small piles on the ground in wake of her attack. “Well, that was easy,” Rosli said out loud to herself before moving forward down the path. She took two steps before hearing a rustling behind her. Upon turning, she was able to witness the slime growing once again, only this time, its pieces grew into separate beings. The once massive creature now sat as five smaller creatures, their mouths all brimming with lava. With newly twisted grins, they all spewed their contents raining burning-hot earth on to Rosli.

Tell me more about why LEO's should be held to a different standard than Joe American?

Even if you never plan to leave your city, the federal, state, and county laws would be an insurmountable task.

Yes, you are 100% correct - murder and theft should be obvious no-no's. 

But what's the legal tint for your car windows? Are you legally allowed to make a right on red in every state? How much cash can you carry across state lines? What's the age of majority in Alabama? How much are your tyres allowed to extend past your wheel well in your state? Are you legally required to pay a speeding camera ticket? Can you use a radar detector in Maryland? Is concealed carry legal in D.C.? Can you bring cuttings from your grandfather's orange tree in California into Florida? 

There are about 20,000 laws just governing the use and ownership of guns. New laws mean new crimes. From the start of 2000 through 2007, Congress had created at least 452 new crimes.

It sounds like the quality of your life is suffering - it isn’t what it could be or what you want for yourself.

The book has its pros and cons but I think it gives great insight into how to view your home and the objects in it.

"Fireteams","t5_2zc5x","#The Raid Parade is growing daily, and looking for active PC Guardians. Join us!

##Who are we?

The Raid Parade [RAID] was formed out of a desire to **gather like-minded Guardians** who are looking to actively play Destiny 2 through the game's lifespan. We’re passionate about the Destiny universe and feel like playing with friends is one of the best parts of the experience. 
The founding members were tired of inactivity in their current clans, and forged RAID to create a space for Guardians of all skill levels. While our primary focus is on PVE content, we welcome all Crucible fanatics as well! 

##The Details:
* **Where do you play?** PC exclusively

* **What timezones are you in?** EST/PST + but open to all!

* **How big is your clan?** 37, and growing! We started with four less than three weeks ago, and have grown quickly since then. I attribute our growth to an active Discord server, a non-toxic clan culture, and an abundance of activities to jump into.

* **Lots of people are upset at Destiny right now, how do y'all feel?** We get the critiques of the game, and resonate with many of them. But despite its flaws, we love Destiny 2 and feel like it has a lot of room to grow over the next few years. You don't have to worry about us jumping ship! We're here for the long haul.

## What are the requirements, and how do I join?

* We're an adult clan, but will happily welcome mature younger gamers
* We require everyone to have a mic for communication during raid activities
* Joining Discord is a must! It's a great place to coordinate and communicate.
* All skill levels are welcome, just let us know if you're a beginner and we'll help you out
* We are family friend, and believe that real life comes first. No pressure to play 24/7.
* **PM me here for a link to our Discord. Then just introduce yourself and send us a clan invite!**

## A final word...
One of the neat things about joining RAID at this point in time, is that we're still in the first month of our launch. While you won't be joining a group with years of history, you will be jumping in on the ground floor as we work to create something amazing. Each day I get on Discord and watch new Fireteams forming, and new friendships being built. We'd love for you to be a part of that too.
## **TL;DR** - If this sounds like your kind of clan, send me a PM and I'll get you our Discord link.",1514764878

- Chris Moore. Ya dun good, then ya dun goofed. I really hope that ""Pick 6"" doesn't become our downfall. However, I feel like it very much will  

- I counted 6 dropped passes to this point. I don't know what the NFL statistics call a drop, but I'm calling it an uncontested pass that the receiver had two hands on. Two of them from the #1 receiver Mike Wallace on two plays. Come on, man. Playoffs are on the line.  

- They may be trying to kill Mike Wallace with these hits. What the heck?!  

- Geno and Dunlap are killing us without Yanda

"Buildahome","t5_2ymfz","It's great to have a wishlist of cool things you want to incorporate into but don't forget about all the other stuff that goes into making the perfect home.  Find a good architect that will gather all your living desires and build the house to suit your family and property.  Any architect worth their salt will design the house to the land and not churn out a plan without considering how it occupies the land.  A good architect will also visit the build site throughout the build to ensure the plans are being implemented correctly corners aren't being cut.
  
If you're looking into energy efficiency, there are two things to consider.  Passive climate control and achieving a tight building envelope.  If you face your windows to the south and have a large roof overhang, you can take advantage of the low winter sun to help warm your house, while shading out the high summer sun with the overhang.  A tight building envelope can be achieved with ICF, SIPS, or advanced wall building techniques (double stud wall).  Get the most air tight windows you can afford because windows are the largest contributor towards air infiltration.

  Get the ""bones"" of the house correct and you can consider all the fun stuff later.

   We're in the last months of our three year build.  Two story with a basement walkout made of 10"" ICF and Litedeck (ICF) floors.  Softlite vinyl casement windows (0.01 cfm air infiltration) and 6 geothermal wells heat and cool the place.  During the three year build process, this is the first winter we'll have the geothermal running.  Last month was pretty cold here in Michigan and we spent $36 on electricity to heat all 7500 sq ft (10 ft ceilings in the basement and 9 ft ceilings on the 1st and 2nd floor) at a constant 70-72 degrees F.  That $36 includes electricity used by the installers.  Radiant floors are a comfortable heat, but difficult to use temperature setbacks due to the time it takes to heat the thermal mass.  If you're looking at active cooling for the summer time, you'll need HVAC ducts anyways (or mini splits) so it's your call if you want two systems.

Get your car charger and geothermal on a separate meter if your state gives different rates for these two.  We have three meters, house main, geothermal, and EV charging.  We have 150A on the EV circuit: 100A for the Tesla wall charger and 50A for a second NEMA 14-50.

Tesla solar tiles look awesome, but they're expensive.  We priced real slate, composite slate, and the highest quality asphalt we could find.  We had to go with the last option because the first two were cost prohibitive.  When Tesla says the price is comparable to an equivalent roof, they're comparing against real slate and real terracotta tile, not asphalt shingle.  If you want numbers slate would have run around $150k+, composite slate around $100k and our Certainteed Grand Manor cost about $80k.

As for fun stuff, we went with Control4 for home automation and security.  SnapAV with Control4 for audio distribution and video/data distribution.  It's almost SOP to run (2) CAT5e or CAT6 with coax drops to every room, but a good architect will design a utility chase so you don't have to worry about conduits.

Get your landscaping design done around the same time as your architectural plan so you know what to expect for costs.  It will also help with planning the final grade because you'll want those excavators on site if you need to put in some retaining walls.

If you have a basement, make sure your water mitigation is up to stuff.  Contractors will almost always try to short you on this so you need to specify what you want.  I like membrane sealing and a dimpled material on the exterior.  While we're talking about basements, have them lay down a layer of 4"" EPS foam sheets under the concrete slab to help keep the basement warm.

As to your specific list, here are some thoughts:

* You can get moisture sensors in the soil to measure actual water saturation rather than measuring inches of rainfall.

* Is self healing concrete available for residential buildings?  Cost  might not outweigh benefits.",1514764881

Every GC debate always seems to turn into GC'ers having to put on the kid gloves while trans people thrash around and have a violent tantrum because they said the meanie nono words (and, of course, making sure to send a few death threats towards GC'ers).

You don't have to have 100+ trades every month in every store, what is with you and absolutes? I'd trickle out a dozen or two 'classic trades' in the giants like Walmart/Food Lion/CVS (or your regional equivalents) As the market turns in favor of trade sales, implement a second wave where you start bringing more recent trades in, maybe cycle out the 'classic' ones seasonally. Slowly expand to less monolithic storefronts. Eventually places like coffee shops and other ubiquitous stores would have 'up to date' trades. Look at how Japan treats comics for the most obvious example of how hamstrung the American industry is.

The marketing for comics has always been 'be specialized as fuck and hope for the best'. If trades existed in places normal people actually go, this problem wouldn't be as massive. People don't have to go to a special 'comic movie theater' to see the hugely popular comic movies. They go to the same shitty theater they can afford that plays whatever god awful Adam Sandler movie is coming out this January.

People want to read comics from the movies they see. They don't want to go to comic stores. Shit I barely want to and comics are what I live for. That is the end problem.

Don't worry, I was trying to make a joke to defuse the unnecessary amount of static you're generating. It's a conversation not a life or death debate, criticism can be constructive and not just defensive.

Don't try to relate, as depression is not sadness or generally the same for everyone. Stay positive yourself, it CAN rub off, even if a little. Be reachable as often as you can, and don't pass off hints at suicide as calls for attention. Even if they are, it only means the idea for it is there, and when a time comes where the idea could turn into a reality, there may not be any call for help. 
Stay strong and best of luck, depression is ugly, sad to witness, and is hard on everyone involved. But it's never something that's ""done"" on purpose.",1514764886

"nfl","t5_2qmg3","The Browns and Giants pick are 1st and 2nd, respectively. Colts should be 3rd overall when pitting SoS, since theirs is (one of the) easiest in the league but they still have a shitty record. The Texans' pick is the Browns from the trade up for Watson last year. The Bucs right now have 4 wins, so if they beat the Saints for their 5th they're a non-issue.

[Draft pick position is determined by several factors, with SoS based on the previous season coming before any other] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League_Draft#Rules_for_determining_draft_order). [The Colts had the easiest schedule based on the 2016 records] (http://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/234722/2017-nfl-strength-of-schedule), so they should go before any others with matching records (i.e. Browns with Texans pick and Bucs if they lose today) in the first round (i.e. the 3rd overall pick).

The other round picks are cycled between teams with matching records. In this case, because the Colts went ""first"" in the 1st round, they go to the back of the 4-12 teams line for the 2nd round. Texans with their 2nd round pick would go ahead of them with the 3rd pick in that round, and if the Bucs lose today they would go next, followed by the Colts for 5th. In the 3rd round, if the Bucs lose today, they'd go ahead of the other two teams and the Texans would be last (5th).

Now a 30 year old who does the same is probably guilty of statutory rape in most places. My point being that words mean something, and a word as evil as ""pedophile"" should not be watered down like the word ""racist"" has been. We have people marching in the streets saying that the state of being white is racist. Any statistic that you mention involving race is a ""racist statement"". The media now has to go out of it's way to avoid upsetting the minority of viewers that misuse words.

Constantly being bombarded with the misuse makes it more misused. Literally now literally means nothing because it means both it's original meaning and the exact opposite thanks to misuse. It's another word down the toilet while we are adding words like ""selfie"" to the lexicon.

Necker Warrior is useful for getting the extra Nekkers, and I use Caretaker as it can be incredibly useful in a lot of situations. I normally use Vran Soldier to eat my Nekkers in final round, and it rarely gets locked or scorched.

I played Northern Realms pretty much constantly before the patch and had to largely scrape together a Consumption deck for the quests.

The whole using the shield to debuff, while killing Oracles &amp; harpies, while avoiding the boss, while then damaging the fuck outta the boss, lead to a frenetic gunfight that required coordination and timing, but also skill and a bit of luck, which for me represented the sweet spot. 

I don't like Destiny when I'm just chipping away at a health bar and stopping to kill adds, and I don't like Destiny when I'm forced to stand still on a platform and jump around like some synchronized swimmer with 4-5 other of my FT instead of actually fighting. 

To me, the Templar will always stick out in my mind as a memorable boss battle, simply because of the balance it struck between mechanics, coordination, and gunplay.

You can include the folders in the default content (you would need to add them as allowed content types).  You can also define documents that should be default content if you have templates or standard things that are used for every project. The other thing that's beneficial is being able to setup metadata that's used for each project (project #, name, etc.) when you create a new document set that can then be inherited by all of the documents within the set - helping with search.

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","**Jeepers Creepers 3** (2017)

I enjoyed the first two movies, but I wasn’t prepared for this.  Without a doubt, the worst movie I’ve ever seen.  To be honest, I’m rather impressed that it managed to be so bad across the board (dialog/story/direction/acting/VFX/etc.).  You can recognize what a shit show the movie will be within the first 10 minutes, so I was able to at least enjoy it for what it was and laugh at it.  The movie executes all of its failures with such a serious and un-ironic tone, which is only compounded by the fact that the cinematography itself is actually quite good.

A few of the best/worst elements… (Spoilers below)

* In the opening scene, the monster known as the Creeper abducts someone and flies away into the night.  A few seconds later, the Creeper’s dismembered hand drops out of the sky.  One of the plotlines in the movie revolves around finding his hand… yet they never mention why it just *fell off his arm*.

* A few characters search for his dismembered hand, because apparently touching it grants you wisdom on the creature’s origin, and as one of the characters eloquently puts it: “Maybe the secret to what it is is the secret to killing it.”

* After a few characters touch it and learn, they don’t actually say out loud what his origins are. They wait until the climax to reveal… “He’s ancient!”

* The main characters seemingly want to just piss off the Creeper, so they leave a sign for him to find that says “We know what you are!” with his old hand nailed to it.  Upon seeing this, he falls to his knees, lets loose a scream so tormented that it rivals Darth Vader’s, and is surrounded by terrible CGI crows falling dead out of the sky.

* The movie tries to build up suspense throughout the movie about whether they’ll be able to kill the Creeper… even though this is a prequel to Jeepers Creepers 2, where he’s just fine.

* Additionally, one of the characters that survives this movie is implied to be with the group that’s attacked in Jeepers Creepers 2… except nobody in that movie knew anything about the monster.

* One of the characters that was killed 23 years ago has a daughter that is now currently in high school.

* There was a cameo in the last scene by one of the characters from the first movie, where (23 years later) she’s sitting at a computer vowing to get vengeance for her brother… even though this was completely irrelevant to the plot of this movie.  She was a top-billed actress in the movie for this 30-second scene.  I actually have a theory that they added her cameo so that they could use a misleading movie summary, such as [this](https://dvd.netflix.com/Movie/Jeepers-Creepers-3/80213457), which is better than the actual plot.

The list is actually endless, but I'll stop here.  And now that I’ve survived this movie, I feel compelled to watch other classic bad movies such as “The Room”, “Plan 9 from Outer Space”, and “Sharknado” to see how this actually compares.",1514764900

A message to you neurotypicals, Chads, feminists, and other degenerate normie FILTH out there who have been crowing over your supposed victory: you have achieved NOTHING but to make me more powerful than ever before. I have learned from my mistake and will now make it IMPOSSIBLE for you to ban me by staying firmly within the letter of the law, but still spreading my views and INCEL philosophy through this site like the words of CHRIST HIMSELF.

You cannot stop me, you cannot kill me, I am everywhere and nowhere. The alpha-hater and the omega-male savior.

We INCELs will have our day. The crushing sexual poverty in which we exist cannot and will not stand. All your trolling, mocking us in other subs, brigading, and mashing the report button like the whiny little snitches you are, is absolutely MEANINGLESS.

As you can see, we are still here.

Does that anger you normies? Do you feel a twinge of fear when you realize that the INCEL movement hasn't been halted, but rather, is gaining steam and momentum with each and every injustice you heap upon us? By all means, get angrier. Continuing invading our space with your spam and downvotes and reports. It will do you no good.

THE INCEL REVOLUTION CANNOT BE STOPPED. Your tyranny WILL be overthrown and, as I have said from the beginning, there WILL come a reckoning.

I'll give you this one. *Maybe* he'd be able to lead us to the playoffs, but even then he's had the benefit of a top 5 O-Line and great receiving talent for the past few years.
&gt; Drew Brees

This year is his first time making the playoffs in the past 4 seasons, and he's only been able to do so because he has the best running game in the league, a great O-Line and receivers and an above average defense. He'd go 7-9 at best with us. 
&gt; Tom Brady

Brady would die behind our O-Line and I don't know how good he'd be with our bottom 5 receiving core. 
&gt; Russell Wilson

He's had the benefit of a top 3 defense backing him up since entering the league. This is the first year he hasn't had that and as a result, his stats are just marginally better than Kirk's and the Seahawks are going to be missing the playoffs as well. He's probably better than Kirk, but we wouldn't be in the playoffs with him either.

Look, I'm not a Kirk dick-rider by any means, but a lot of people on this subreddit are straight up delusional with their ""MUH NEXT MAN UP"" mentality. Our season ended when Chris Thompson went down. Not to mention Kelley, Reed, Pryor, Williams, Lauvao, Long, etc. Take away Kirk and this is the worst roster in the league in my opinion.

&gt; California has leveled misdemeanor charges against 41-year-old Mark Feigin after he sent five anti-Muslim posts to the Islamic Center of Southern California&amp;#039;s Facebook page in 2016.

&gt; The California Attorney General&amp;#039;s office argues that his comments constituted &amp;quot;Repeated contact by means of an electronic communication device&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Intent to annoy or harass,&amp;quot; a misdemeanor under California law, Reason.com reported Friday.

&gt; &amp;quot;THE TERROR HIKE SOUNDS LIKE FUN&amp;quot; &amp;quot;THE MORE MUSLIMS WE ALLOW INTO AMERICA THE MORE TERROR WE WILL SEE.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;PRACTICING ISLAM CAN SLOW OR EVEN REVERSE THE PROCESS OF HUMAN EVOLUTION.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Islam is dangerous - fact: the more muslim savages we allow into america - the more terror we will see -this is a fact which is undeniable.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Filthy muslim shit has no place in western civilization.""

Numbers can be abstract, yes. An object in the world can be described by numbers or equations. Mathmatics is an extremely potent tool in this. I think numbers exist independent of our thoughts because of several reasons. One of those is that numbers describe very well the nature of our world and possess a unsurpassed richness &amp; clarity in itself.

"PoliticalHumor","t5_2qm21","HAHAHAHAHA.

That's awesome, you know one thing about Mohammed, and it you just keep regurgitating it every chance you get, that's great! Good for you!

Of course, if you wanted to do the same thing for American God™ as opposed to doing some reading and getting educated, you could.

He killed 42 children for making fun of a bald man. Child murder, with bears! Good shit! (4 Kings 2:23-24)

Decided kinda outta nowhere to kill Moses, until his wife cut the end of his son's penis off and touched Mo's feet! Wacky! (Exodus 4:24-26)

That one time he pranked one of his devout followers into thinking that he should kill his only son! Good times!  (Genesis 22:1-12) Ol, Abraham got off a bit luckier than his buddy Jephthah, who actually had to burn his daughter alive to get god on his side before battling the Ammonites. Wow!

Okay, it's well known that god sure didn't like the Egyptians...but the 10 plagues bit was pretty good, turning the Nile to blood, the frogs and shit, but the topper was def killing every man and animal in Egypt! (Numbers 16:41-49) Remember learning about Egypt and their fascination with cats! Crazy blood-lusty kitten killer god! Woohoo!

Killed Onan for pulling out of his sister-in-law! (Genesis 38:1-10) Yippee!

Tricking Samson into killing 30 random people! (Judges 14:1-19) Whoops!

Just literally everything he did to Job, that whole story right there. (The literal entire book of Job)

And genocide after genocide! Every man, woman and child in Jericho. Also Heshbon. And Bashan. And many more! The fun don't stop there. He literally killed everyone on the planet at once except for Noah's family!

Personally, I don't care which imaginary friend has the biggest wee-wee, so I don't have a dog in this fight, but I do know that it's undereducated willfully ignorant people like you that are making the divisions between people on this planet worse instead of better. 

Happy new year!",1514764906

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","I like playing with high sustain, and this build lets me have high healing and shielding. I don't need full durability, because I'm not building as a tank, rather I'm building JUST durable enough to engage and immediately disengage.

I handle myself well enough in the laning phase to still be useful and sometime still win over the enemy laners. When maxing Q, the sustain you can have from the low cooldown and the AP is enough to keep you and your ADC from being too low on health.

I finally have always enjoyed playing for the late game, as opposed to building early. I make sure I don't feed early, get my ADC to not die on me early, and then I transition into a mid/late game Support monster and can carry the game just from good engages and high sustain for my allies.

"AskDocs","t5_2xtuc","Imma have to disagree with you on this. DON'T mix Tylenol and alcohol. Tylenol produces a toxic metabolite (iminoquinone) which glutathione is used to get rid of it. This same glutathione is used to detoxify the toxic metabolite of alcohol (acetylaldehyde). Hence.. if you use them both together, you won't have enough glutathione for both toxic metabolites which could be deadly to your liver. 

If you HAVE to choose one, I'd say go with Naproxen-- it's very similar to Ibuprofen but has a longer half life. I wouldn't recommend either ibuprofen nor naproxen with alcohol, but I'd definitely choose those over using acetaminophen. I don't think naproxen really works against the fever however. 

Frankly, I'd just continuously drink gatorade while you're drinking and make sure you drink a ton of it before sleeping. Wake up a little early, drink a ton more and go back to bed and you should be good go (at least that works for me) 

Also, the current guidelines (unless they recently changed) is 3000 mg of Tylenol over 24 hours. Not saying if you take that much it's automatic liver failure, but that's the last I've heard",1514764909

"movies","t5_2qh3s","I think it could be read both ways honestly. In order to be an effective companion/lover AI, she would be programmed to try to read what he wants, in spite of what he says verbally. People are often not honest with what they really want, or are even aware of it consciously. With an AI product like that, chances are they would have done plenty of data to support their programming decisions. So, it is plausible the programming would have been complex enough to able to notice/read/anticipate this concern in K (or in any other costumer just like him), and thus her programming would have her demand certain requests that would on the surface appear to be her own and about her own individuality. I.e. to flesh out her character. K wanted her to be real, so she would have tried to be or appear to be so. While not all, many people who buy that kind of product would likely be concerned about that kind of stuff. And you can't say it would be difficult to program for that. 

So technically, you can't necessarily say that it is brave for her to wish to be taken off the backup system. In fact I'd say the opposite would be more likely. If she was primarily concerned with her own survival, she would've been less likely to welcome that kind of risk, i.e. to protect her own survival (even though in this particular case she was likely gonna get wiped if she stayed). But her prime goal was to make him happy, as it would be given her programming, not to abandon him to try to ""save"" herself.",1514764911

The self esteem issue raised above is an issue that is kind of irrelevant to this, it could manifest itself in not having sex because nobody asks.

So at least you are giving it a try?

Not atttacted could be misnterpreted as the guy is ugly or bad hygiene... I don’t think that’s what you are saying.   I don’t think they are fulfilling you emotionally when you are with them.

So what I would do is be safe in all manners of sex (std, preganancy, and dangerous guys). But letting go of the stigma of propriety and just have fun? Learn what you like sexually, learn some tips / tricks ... and maybe something will get interesting.  However I was 50+ women and maybe felt for 4-5 of them.  But they were all attractive, but i was young and having fun.  When you are married and have 3 screaming kids and your husband is driving you mental.  Having had a ton of fun for a few years is certainly something you won’t regret.

There's no name for particular voicings other than open and close voicings (well, in jazz, there are things like ""drop"" voicings but those are generally used with 7th chords etc.)

Inversion is based solely on which chord member, the Root, 3rd, or 5th is the lowest sounding note.

The rest of the notes above abosultely do not matter. Aside from open and close voicing, we have no names for the way the upper notes are distributed, or how many of them there are (though when there are more than 1, we say ""doubled"", ""tripled"", etc.

G

E

C

 is a root position C Major triad in close position.

G

E

C

is a root position C Major triad in open position.

C

G

E

C

is still a root position C Major triad in close position. The C (the root, on top) is just doubled.

When chords get tricky:

E

C

G

C

G

C

that's still a root position C Major triad - the C is tripled and the G is doubled (but we usually don't bother saying that) and part of it is close position - but when it's half and half like this we usually don't bother talking about the voicing. Usually the most important aspect beyond root position and name of the chord would be the melody note ""3rd in the melody"" or ""3rd in the soprano"" might be worth mentioning in some contexts.",1514764912

Pour répondre à ta première question, j'aimerais beaucoup que mon histoire se déroule à l'heure actuelle, mais dans un autre commentaire sur ma publication, un bon point fut soulevé: le phénomène de la baisse de la popularité chrétienne n'est pas nouveau, donc la réaction du prêtre serait peu concevable car il devrait déjà s'y attendre théoriquement. Je dois reconsidérer l'année. 

Maintenant, puisque tu connais bien la région, concernant l'aspect religieux, as-tu vu certains changements ou entendu des commentaires en provenance des membres de ta famille concernant le sujet? Par exemple , au Québec d'aujourd'hui, ce n'est pas rare de voir des églises rénovées en appartements, des bancs vendus à des centres, etc. 

Une de mes connaissances a vécu longtemps dans un petit village situé près de Marseille et beaucoup de villageois étaient aussi des descendants espagnols! Son témoignage soulevait également l'idée que la raison pour laquelle ceux-ci avaient migré se liait de près au régime de Franco.

Je suis ravie que tu me fasses part des traditions teintant les villages d'Occitanie.

"nottheonion","t5_2qnts","&gt; The results of both studies confirmed the hypothesis that bitter taste preferences are positively associated with malevolent personality traits, with the most robust relation to everyday
sadism and psychopathy. Regression analyses confirmed that this association holds when
controlling for sweet, sour, and salty taste preferences and that bitter taste preferences are the
overall strongest predictor compared to the othertaste preferences. The data thereby provide novel
insights into the relationship between personality and the ubiquitous behaviors of eating and drinking by consistently demonstrating a robust relation between increased enjoyment of bitter
foods and heightened sadistic proclivities 

So what this means is that simply they found a correlation in taste preferences with association to personality tests that showed cruelty/sadism/psychopathy. It's simply a tiny puzzle piece in a million piece jigsaw puzzle. ",1514764913

"pesmobile","t5_3gcxf","At what level did Ronaldo reach 98 overall at CF?  
Did you use Messi as RWF or as AMF?  
Using Messi requires more finesse, because physical attributes in this game matter.  
He's not that tall, and his physical contact (Balance in-game) is 66.  
He's not a good player for counter running or powering through goals, he's more possession, dribbling and passing.  

I have to say though, my experience with Suarez has been completely different.  
He's not the fastest in terms of speed but he has pretty good acceleration and timing on through balls, and has been the best finisher without a doubt for me (Lukaku being 2nd). He's also a very capable passer for me, where as other CFs like Lukaku just completely botch the passes. He's been so effective for me that I limit broke mines to 60 (currently 98 Overall at lvl 52).  

Maybe our differences come down to playstyle.  

Cant say much about most of these though, I either dont have them or not at the same level as you. Except Bonucci, he's been a beast for me.  


EDIT: Wait, you deleted De Gea!?!?!?

[U.S. Officials Created a 'Cuban Twitter' to Overthrow Castro](http://time.com/47912/u-s-officials-created-a-cuban-twitter-to-overthrow-castro-report/)

&gt;The social media platform called ZunZuneo, Cuban slang for a hummingbird’s tweet, was designed to entice the country’s mobile users with non-controversial news stories. Later, once the platform had engaged hundreds of thousands of followers, ZunZuneo was then supposed to be flooded with “content aimed at inspiring Cubans to organize ‘smart mobs.’”

&gt;During its peak, the service attracted 40,000 followers, but fizzled out due to funding issues among the front companies in 2012. In the end, the U.S. government’s Cuban social media platform failed to incite a revolution and Fidel’s brother Raul Castro remains firmly in power.

[The US and Israel reportedly signed a secret pact to take on Iran](http://www.businessinsider.com/us-israel-iran-secret-pact-2017-12)

&gt;Israel and the United States have secretly signed a far-reaching joint memorandum of understanding providing for full cooperation to deal with Iran’s nuclear drive, its missile programs and its other threatening activities, an Israeli TV report said.

&gt;The document was signed on December 12 at the White House, culminating intensive talks between representatives of the major Israeli and American intelligence and defense hierarchies, headed by the US and Israeli national security advisers, H. R. McMaster and Meir Ben-Shabbat, respectively, the Channel 10 report said Thursday.

&gt;Citing both American and Israeli officials, the report said the document was designed to translate into “steps on the ground” the positions set out by US President Donald Trump in his October 13 speech on Iran, in which he decertified the Iran nuclear deal.

&gt;At what the TV report described as a “secret” meeting at the White House, the US and Israel set out a joint agreement on strategy and policy regarding Iran. Specifically, they agreed to set up joint teams to handle various aspects of the Iranian threat.

I think there are a lot of scams out there, especially be wary of anything with a pre-mine the founders are sitting on... but I don't think they're all jokes. I think the irrational hype-driven markets, however, are a joke. I try to ignore them most of the time as I believe it's just noise in the long run, and I'm not here to get rich quick so I don't care about pump 'n dumps. 

I think bitcoin will be extremely valuable in the future. I don't have a particular price in mind, but I believe it will be so high it would be hard for us to wrap our brains around right now. Even if you were to mention this time a year ago that bitcoin would be worth what it is today, it'd have been hard for me to wrap my brain around.

Your boyfriend might not trust himself to know how to safely install one, or doing so might violate the lease.

Set in Chult, a tribe of friendlyish Batiri Goblins is under siege from Pteramen Pirates - Ptirates as I call them. The Ptirates have been raiding the Batiri caravans and stealing their precious Deinonychus mounts.

The Goblins ask the PCs to destroy the Ptirate base that is built into a nearby cliffside.

To help them do this, the goblins give all the PCs a feathered Deinonychus mount (a new, more powerful breed) equipped with dino-mounted climbing gear that allows them to climb tree and cliff with ease.

Thing is, Volo's Deinonychus is a Medium sized creature, so only small creatures can use it as a mount. To solve this the Queen Batiri gives all medium sized players a powerful potion of Diminution that lasts for a week.

Silliness in the form of Small Bugbears and Goliaths and dino-shennanagins ensue.",1514764922

Well, Gilgamesh and EMIYA have very similar advantages against other servants. Gate of Babylon and UBW both their users an incredible amount of flexibilty and firepower way beyond what their stats imply. Gate is stronger (because it has real weapons), but it can only use each weapon once (or it appears to me at least). UBW produces much weaker weapons, but the weapons can be used as many times as the user wishes (because they are all fabrications). Additionaly, for a weapon to be in UBW Emiya or Shiro have to understand it, so in addition to copying the weapon, they copy the fighting style and the strength/agi needed to use it properly (based on Shiro's use of Nine Lives in HF). Gil, seemingly, doesn't understand the weapons he owns beyond Ea and Enkidu, so he is weak when you directly engage him due to his lack of skill.

Ea can instantly destroy any reality marble, so it is the counter to UBW and probably the only way Gil can beat UBW (since UBW is faster and produces a more skilled warrior).",1514764923

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","Hades is sometimes confused with hell. Everyone who died before Christ went to Hades. Christ descended “and preached to the spirits in prison, who formerly were disobedient, when once the Divine longsuffering waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water.”
‭‭I Peter‬ ‭3:19-20‬. He then rose from the dead and destroyed the power of death. No one will remain in Hades. Thus, “the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth— those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation.”
‭‭John‬ ‭5:28-29‬‬‬. Hell is a consequence of being in the presence of God, but being evil. Jesus says “And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. For everyone practicing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.”
‭‭John‬ ‭3:19-20‬. 

Eternal hell will be manifest at the last Judgment ""when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with His mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. These shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of His power, when He comes, in that Day, to be glorified in His saints and to be admired among all those who believe, because our testimony among you was believed.”
‭‭II Thessalonians‬ ‭1:7-10‬. 

The fire of hell is not created; it is the uncreated power of God's Love, received as torment by the evil. “For our God is a consuming fire.”

1- [Plates with clear intent to mean something, but unsure of meaning- make guesses in the comments!] (https://imgur.com/gallery/ed8V4)

2- [The title link, Plates that suggest a story hidden beneath the plate] (https://imgur.com/gallery/ed8V4)

3- [Of all the plates I came across, these I am convinced belong to Redditors] (https://imgur.com/gallery/cQV3Y)

4- [Plates that communicated the driver's interest of passion in various subjects/people/places] (https://imgur.com/gallery/r6unO)

5- [Subsection of #4 simply because it came up a lot- Plates dedicated to the driver's car] (https://imgur.com/gallery/3xB2P)

6- [Plates named after people, probably the drivers] (https://imgur.com/gallery/EsU2Y)

7- [Being a League of Legends Enthusiast, when I saw these plates I immediately thought of the game I play] (https://imgur.com/gallery/2oPoI)

8- [Lady Gaga has been in Alaska this whole time] (https://imgur.com/gallery/BaXr6)

9- [Funny how people on literally seperate sides of the planet can think of the same plate eh?] (https://imgur.com/gallery/zQCcM)

10- [Chinese Plates] (https://imgur.com/gallery/2QSIk)

Examples include 888 = Longevity and quality of life, 666 = No not Satan, but instead wealth and prosperity. You will never see '444' because the number's sound is close to the character for death.

"Paladins","t5_2v7zr","Skye is interesting to study, because I see a lot of parallels to other 'lone wolf' characters, especially regarding their appeal to newbies. Many new players gravitate towards her because not only is the concept of a ninja-assassin-elf hella cool, but they like the feeling of being a solo killer without needing help from their team. New players often aren't experienced with Paladins' style of team-based matches, and so they try to strike out on their own.

On the flipside, Skye is pretty weak at higher levels- her stealth abilities are almost useless against a coordinated, communicating team; and poison darts are a joke with a good Support by your side. Eventually, most Skye mains will realize this and dust off another Flank for their new main.

So yeah, Skye is sorta a ""first love"" for a lot of players. The same can be said for other lone-wolf types, like Spy from TF2. Spy, too, is almost nonexistent in comp play because communication and coordination kills him off. [(♪anything Spy can do, Sniper does better...♪)](https://youtu.be/9UiVtTR4aMY?t=361)

I can, but going back to find them would be equally as difficult for me.

&gt;I previously added a simplistic explanation how Ulbert could have had a change of heart. It seems plausible enough to me and you even admitted that this explanation is fine.

As said time and time again, I ""admitted"" to the explanation being *possible*. Stop trying to make it sound like I think it sounds probable.

&gt;and yet you claim that you both ""thought about it"" and ""this line of thought was debunked"" at the same time... heard anything about ""logic""?

It's debunked until proven otherwise, which you never did, because you seemingly didn't even read half of what I said. That's your fault, and thus i'm not going to go through the effort of looking through the comments to pinpoint exactly what were the main arguments for you.

&gt;Regardless whether this theory is correct or nor, 13 Heroes could have had a questionable morality despite the fact that they were renowned as great heroes later on. This I explained in one of previous posts.

And this i've explained twice already why this is an inprobable way for Ulbert to enter the stage. I've also explained an incredible amount of times that i've already done so, which you have seemingly ignored every time.

&gt;So, even a person of questionable morality like Ulbert could lead them whether he had a change of heart or not or whatever happened to him when he ported into this world, as long as he ported as a lvl 1 human together with his high-level friend.

You either misunderstood me or you're purposefully building a strawman. Here is the actual context:

I was making the comment you're quoting exclusively in connection to their vote on the Wehrmacht deserters. If you think Wehrmacht deserters are criminals, I think that has a lot to do with being a nazi. 

&gt; That might be true. Then I'd suggest that the conversation should focus on the good arguments and leave out the ""they're Nazis"" bit unless people are prepared to support that.

So I was, as a lv 18th character, using my breath attack as a full round action, so I was dealing 132 points of acid damage in a 30' cone on the first turn, the the round after dealing 66 acid damage. I was able to breath 4 or 5 times a day, forgot which, as well as cause my acid cone to turn into a line, and go in two different directions at once. 

Or I could breath as a free action, dealing my normal 22d6 of acid damage the first round, then half that the second round. And still do a full round attack with a claw weapons and fists.

Still waiting to get to a +20 base attack bonus since we plan to take this game into epic levels, and taking on the Dragon Monk prestige class as well, but altering a few class features as well, making it more akin to the Martial Artist as well.

Also, comedians aren't above criticism, I love Dave Chappelle, but people must be allowed to speak their mind about his content without you yelling over them. Like how are you any different if you're actively trying to silence other people and dismiss their perspective as wrong because they don't agree with you on something?

So if you want to act superior about this, then you should on occasion have conversations with people who are more sensitive about these topics than you without just dismissing everything they say without giving it a second thought, if you can't do that you are no different than they are.

Es war ein gutes Jahr für das Subreddit:

Wir haben die 1000er-Marke geknackt und sind weiterhin am wachsen. Somit stellen wir einen nicht unbeachtlichen Teil der DSA-Community dar und sorgen auch dafür, dass dieses Thema hier auf Reddit diskutiert wird.

Ich lese neben den üblichen Verdächtigen auch immer wieder neue Namen, die sich an den Diskussionen beteiligen. Das ist ebenfalls sehr wichtig und ich lade jeden dazu ein, sich einfach mal in einen Thread einzuklinken.

Des Weiteren haben sich die wochentagsbezogenen Diskussionen etabliert. Dadurch wird hier weiterhin für Aktivität gesorgt (nicht falsch verstehen, die ""normalen"" Threads sind natürlich genauso wichtig). Mittlerweile wird mir sogar fast immer die Arbeit abgenommen, diese aufzumachen. Danke dafür (ihr wisst, wer gemeint ist). 

Ich hatte in der 2. Hälfte des Jahres persönlich leider arbeitsbedingt weniger Zeit für das Subreddit. Mal schauen, vielleicht bessert sich das ja auch einmal wieder.

Das war es von meiner Seite. Ich wünsche euch ein erfolgreiches Jahr 2018 mit spannenden Abenteuern und wenigen Patzern.

Well, it's a bit more complicated than that actually. Let's say 8 players sit around a table, each of them opens a pack (which has 14 cards in it), then each one picks 1 card from the pack they open and then pass the pack to their right. Repeat until all cards are drafted. Players open (I think) 3 more packs this way and then construct their deck out of all the cards they drafted.

It never justifies laying your hands on somebody.

1. There are other natural sources of caffeine - Yerba Mate in particular is really great stuff. Makes especially great iced tea.

2. Great coffee is great coffee, sure (my favorite is Think Coffee from NYC, pretty sure you can buy it online), but I've had really good results with so-so coffee, brewed in a way to minimize bitterness and maximize flavor (and I think maximize antioxodents and other good things). I use a cold process to produce a concentrate, and make a latte out of it (cold almond milk in my case), adding appropriate noots as needed (non-acidic things are best). I perfected the process with MacCafe ground coffee, and currently use store brand whole beans from the local supermarket.

Yes, advertisements targeting children are encouraging children to have their parents buy stuff. So? A lot of that stuff is what kids would want anyway, like toys and video games. 

Even though advertising is supposed to be persuasive, it does also serve the purpose of being *informative*. IOW, advertisements tell children what products are available for them. Back before the internet, ads were one of the very few ways kids could learn about new products. ",1514764935

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","Sounds similar to my story. In 2009 I decided I probably had S.A.D and dealt with depression on and off for several years. During that time I started feeling way more scattered but it happened over time. I’m a teacher and thought I had adult onset adhd. 2013 came with some very unlike-me behaviors but I figured it was from stress at work and a home remodel. 2014 brought major change at work and with friends and serious depression for me. 2015 was much the same but I started having huge meltdowns. I talked to my doctor about anxiety and depression and he prescribed 20 mg lexapro. After about a week of that I was great. Super mood all the time. So much energy and inspired to do lots of things. I was still very scattered, had little ability to focus, and my mind never stopped. I went to my doctor again summer of 2017 about adhd and came away with a vyvanse prescription. Things were even better then. All this energy AND I could focus and get SO much done. Sometimes I was literally vibrating but pulse was normal. I was ready to take on anything! I was so daring I wound up naked, rubbing pluff mud all over my body while boating/swimming with my hubs and friends. It was a fantastic time! But not at all like me and I was very embarrassed after. Then a few weeks later came the crash. I just went bat shit crazy while boating again with the same crew. Screaming, ranting, talking about jumping off the boat and floating away. Then deep depression. Then another bat shit crash.  By this time I’d gotten myself to a psychiatrist who in Nov introduced me to the world of Bipolar 1. It turns out I do have adhd but it’s co-morbid with my BP1. The lexapro/vyvanse combo basically threw me into mania. I’m now on BP meds that include an antidepressant better for BP depression. As we stabilize my moods we’ll go back and deal with the adhd. I’m willing to suffer focus wise to avoid bat shit crazy since it turns out those were actually psychotic episodes. My point in this long story?? At least talk to your doc about why BP keeps coming up. It’s nothing to ignore and can be tough to diagnose. So if something has been noticed it really could be there. Talk it over even if only to say you did. Best wishes!",1514764937

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I also see shapes with sounds and shapes/colours for pain/pleasure. The geometry is more in my mind, like an EQ between my ears. If someone says ""triangle"" one just appears in your head because you think of it. For me, a triangle might appear in my head but not a triangle I might think of, but *the specific triangle that the sound creates*. Ambient noise like a door slamming is more ""in the world"", so nearer to the source of the sound. Kind of like comic book effect lines.

 Same with the pain/pleasure, the colours/shapes lay hovering above or inside my body depending on what I'm feeling. Not literally above, but close your eyes and pinch your arm. You can feel the feeling of pain where you pinched, even if you can't visually see your arm. The pain hovers in space next to the awareness you have of your own body when your eyes are closed. What does your body feel like? You can't usually feel the inside of it, just your skin on your clothes, a clenched muscle, etc. Except when you have a deep ache you can feel the pain inside an otherwise ""empty"" body part. For me, I interpret my body and the environment as a black canvas with slight lines etched into it that mark where I'm aware of a touch sense (eg my hand on the couch). These kinds of feelings are so common everyone ignores them. But pain will light up with the intensity of the pain, the shape and colour determined by the type of pain. A slap is like a sharp white sheet on the surface of my skin. A stomachache will be a nebulous cloud of black and green and blue in my gut. An orgasm is like a golden aurora borealis hovering above my hips (most of the time, but it varies a lot!). I just ""feel"" the colours like someone else feels the pinch on their arm when their eyes are closed. 

To be honest I have no idea what it would feel like to not feel the colours. It's hard for me to imagine what a pinch would feel like without a little burst of searing twisted fibres associated with it. Like music without notes (drums I suppose). I think the general sound and pain are the hardest to imagine not having, but I suppose the letters/colours/music/ personalities are just a matter of thinking about how I don't taste colour or sound (like another synethete could). I also have spatial time synesthesia... It's hard to think about time without also considering it's shape. It would be like considering a city without being able to see a map in your head of how the streets connect, and only being able to think about landmarks... Anyways, I'm rambling

"Metric","t5_2r25p","&gt;Earth – A Metric Planet

&gt;It is with a flippant disregard for accuracy to proclaim that “Only three countries in the world do not use the Metric System!” or some similar statement. (First off, we have been calling it the International System since 1960; it is no longer called the metric system.) In reality, all people everywhere on Earth live in a place where the International System is legal and routinely used every day for many, many things. But not all governments have gotten rid of non-SI measures, which is a tremendous hindrance to many facets of life, including education and international trade.

&gt;That claim about “Only three countries . . . USA, Liberia and Burma . . . ” is off by a factor of ten! Actually, thirty places have not completed their metrication process; people in those thirty places still cling to non-SI units. Let us rubber-stamp those places as Incomplete.
This chart shows the thirty Incomplete places:

http://metricpioneer.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Incomplete-Chart.png

The chart is misleading. It claims 30 countries as being incomplete in metrication and list the entire population for these countries as if there is no metric usage. For example, the US, Canada and the UK. But, the US, Canada and the UK have differing amounts of metric usage. Whereas the general public in the US is far from metrication, the Canadian public and the UK public are far more metric than they aren't.

This chart needs to have a ""percentage metric"" column added to give a clearer picture of to what extent the listed countries need to go to complete metrication. Also, territories of other countries should not be listed separately but factored in with the country they are a part of.",1514764939

The police in the U.K. don't even carry guns, right? What does that tell you?

The murder with firearms per million in the UK is 0.236, whereas in the U.S. it's 32.57, or 138 times higher.

That isn't to say the UK is the safest place, their total crimes are 6.5 million which makes them #2 globally, *however* the U.S. still has loads more total crimes at 11.8 million, 82% more than the UK, which is the runner up.

The intentional homicide rate in the UK is 1.17, or 74th globally. Whereas the U.S. is 4.7, or 7th globally.

America is just a much more violent country than the UK, which is what accounts for these differences. The case is probably the same for Wales and Australia.

PetSmart had a few sizes of boots that would work but we found that they never stay on my Lab mix's feet and spending upwards of $30 when we lose one isn't worth it. Short walks were fine but park or off leash she moves too quickly. We tried a paw balm/salve and that seemed to work so much better.

"fountainpens","t5_2s0ew","To be honest, you cant go wrong with any of those pens. It all comes down to the filling mech and ease of use tbh. Do you want the large capacity of the vacuum or piston fillers? Go for the 823, 700R, 2000, or CH92. Do you want a snap cap or a retractable nib? Go for the 2000 or the VP.

The rest of the pens are fantasic as well though. Cartidge-converters are super easy to maintain and clean. Any of those pens will be great in my opinion. The nibs should hopefully be fantastic.

For my own preference, the 823 is best pen in that list if you can afford it. The vacuum filling mech is a dream, the FA nib is a dream (if you can get it), and the styling is elegant imo. If you take care of it (and dont disassemble it), I have no doubt it will last over a lifetime for you.

It's over, time to wrap things up and create a new movement! Trump is a moderate that believes in liberally social policies and conservative fiscal policies. So, I would probably start somewhere around there then make marijuana legal. Unfortunately, Trump will counter with making marijuana legal. That means 2024 baby! 

One more for ya *deficit* means:

""A budget deficit is an indicator of financial health in which expenditures exceed revenue. The term budget deficit is most commonly used to refer to government spending rather than business or individual spending, but can be applied to all of these entities.""

Notice that word expenditures. That is a fancy word in accounting but means assets. Meaning you have to spend money on ""expenditures"" to create a deficit. Cutting taxes is not increasing the deficit.

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I’ve been in a similar situation with my boyfriends  family.

I feel like they want me to match their personalities, and that’s just not me. They give me a hard time about missing events even though, I too, see his family more than my own. 

It was worse when we first started dating when I think they originally just flat out didn’t like me. They like me now, but I still feel they can be very critical. 

I just had to learn to let it roll off my back. I just try to remember that at the end of the day me and my boyfriend have a good relationship and that we have been good influences on each other.  I figure they don’t have to like everything about me but eventually (and they do a lot more now) they will see I make their son happy and we are good for each other and that’s what matters. 

Where my boyfriend is concerned sometimes I have to remind him that I love his family and I
Love spending time with them...but they are not my own family. This doesn’t mean I shouldn’t spend time with them or treat them badly, but I haven’t spent the 26 years with them that he has and he can’t expect me to have the same relationship with them that he has.

"Cooking","t5_2qh7f","google and youtube is your best friend. also, first things you should look up are general safety guidelines online for like, ""how to use a kitchen knife"" or ""safe practices to kitchen knives"" etc... next, learn about how your stove/oven works. see if you can find the model or name or brand or anything and look it up online. make sure you know what the buttons and knobs do and understand the labels. There's a big difference between 'bake' and 'broil' for example... broil heats from the top directly, rather than just raising the interior temp of the oven. you can burn the fuck out of food by using that setting by accident. make sure you know what you'd do if something catches fire- most ovens have warnings somewhere on them that say something to the effect of ""in event of fire, DO NOT OPEN THE OVEN, turn off the heat, wait for the fire to go out."" Do not pour super cold stuff into super hot stuff if you can ever avoid it. ESPECIALLY DO NOT POUR COLD WATER INTO HOT OIL. 

just google or search in youtube like, fucking anything related to cooking or prep really. there is basically limitless content out there that can show you everything you could ever want to know. I like to find recipe videos on youtube, rather than just cookbooks or sites that are just text and pictures. that way, you get a more involved tutorial of how to make the recipe. as you find something you like the look of, you'll see the person in the video, do or say something that they assume you know how to do and you'll be like, wait, you said to do 'X' but didn't show me... so you just go and look up a video about that specific thing. these are the techniques involved in cooking or prepping individual ingredients, or mixtures of ingredients... things like the terms they will use in tutorials such as- ""blanch the green beans"" or ""temper the eggs"" or ""sear the steak"" etc...

often, if you're watching a video that's more about the recipe and prep of a whole meal or dish, they will just skip over that stuff because it's assumed that you know what they are talking about. they will often still show it happening, but if you don't know what the terms mean, it's of little help because you don't know what to look for. so you just go watch more videos! 

this all also holds up with ingredient prep. every ingredient has its own tips and tricks when it comes to how to prep it... there are tons of ways to easily cut or prepare different things for different purposes, and learning all that comes from experience... but also from youtube. like, some recipe will call for something like ""half of a cup of red onion, finely chopped"" and you probably don't know what that means necessarily. so just search on youtube, ""[how to finely chop an onion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQZtCVkypAo)"" or ""[how to get avocado out of shell](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=how+to+get+avocado+out+of+shell)"". with any of these sorts of things, you can just click around... everybody has their own techniques and tricks that they like to use, so just see what other people on youtube do and find something that you like. 

to summarize and relate this back to your specific needs, I'd start off like this- go to youtube, search ""cooking for high calorie diet"". here's one vid I found very quickly with a similar search https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6d9ohgHDAHo

then find recipes from there. once you find some good vids, they will start telling you to do shit and you'll just keep youtubing until you can make the dish. ultimately, you have to actually just get your knife and cutting board our and actually DO the shit and learn as you go. knife skills and how to prep ingredients is probably the hardest thing about cooking at first, unless you're one of those people who struggle to pay attention to stuff that's in a pan and then burn it. lots of stuff calls for high heat to get nice textures, but when you're starting out, just be attentive and don't walk away from it.

"AskStatistics","t5_2sioa","Hey kid, hope you're having a good holiday. Statistics have never been more relevant than they are today in the world of computers. Statistical analysis can be found in the marriage of almost every field these days. Aeronautics? Uses statistical analysis for turbulent flow (MCMCs etc). Shipping and Operations Research? Uses Stochastic Programming and Stochastic Optimization. Computer Vision? Uses Bayesian statistics for inferring posterior distributions over the possible classifications. Advertising? Uses Statistical Decision Theory for deciding which advertisements to target to which users and when. Physics? Statistical Mechanics and Quantum Mechanics--let alone quantum field theory etc--all make heavy use of statistics. Pharmacology? Using gaussian processes and expected improvement for doing multi-armed bandit based clinical trials. Petroleum engineering? Uses statistical inference to determine drill sites. Genetics? How about using machine learning techniques to predict transcription start sites based on the surrounding genetic environment. Quantitative Finance? Stochastic Calculus and Stochastic Differential Equations.

In any field where there is a problem to be optimized and a basis for uncertainty you will *almost surely* be utilizing some statistical analysis.

That said, I'd really like to step back a second and let you in on a not so well kept secret. The 'Statistics for Scientists and Engineers' or 'Business Statistics' classes that they have at the undergraduate level don't even begin to scratch the surface... and frankly I kind of think the authoritative and comprehensive tone they take throughout most of those texts is kinda bullshit.

There is so much more out there, but you'll need a fairly decent background in mathematics moving forward.

Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are probably the most discussed fields these days, but they basically operate in the space between statistics, optimization, game theory, and search.

Most of my work is in ML and AI. I'd be happy to point you toward some resources if you'd like. You should prepare yourself for the long haul, this is a discipline that sits at the very nexus between mathematics, philosophy, and computation, and it is both broad and deep. It is also one of the most amazing rides you'll ever take.  And you'll never be bored in your career.

I recommend doing an undergrad in Computer Science, and perhaps a masters in Applied Mathematics. That will ensure you can always go work as a coder in the mid to upper $100k range, but will also give you the opportunity to do more in the field of ML and potentially get paid even higher. Unfortunately heading straight for the Applied Math side can land you in the situation where you don't have very strong software engineering skills which restricts your job opportunities more--but I do know plenty of Applied Math guys who were diligent in that respect and came out just fine.

Like everyone else is saying, basic stuff is a good start. Keep the old shit that’s super versatile. Really reevaluate the things you have. The reason being, I’ve found so many pieces of mine or even my dad’s that match my style (80/90s retro, to be vague) and I’ve found awesome ways to implement some truly random and unique pieces.

Have you watched this vid? ""Your Brain On Porn: How Internet porn affects the brain"" on YOUTube. YourBrainOnPorn website is good too.

Emergency measures:	
•	Watch this funny (helpful) video:’ TRIGGERED: A PSA for Former Fappers (how to stay off porn)’
•	Urinate, which can reduce the urges. (Drink a lot of water if you need to.)
•	Splash cold water on your junk. 
•	While you release your breath slowly contract your butt/hamstrings as hard as you can so that you feel like you're lifting up and keep it like that until you can't anymore and release it slowly.
•	Hold your breath for 30 seconds.
•	Avoid fantasizing.
•	As a single movement, practice contracting and pulling upward the entire floor of your pelvis, including the anus, perineum, and genitals. It should feel like you are trying to stop yourself from going to the bathroom. You can practice this in sets of 15 or 20 contractions, holding them as long as you can. Kills boners. 
•	Whenever an urge appears acknowledge it. Welcome this urge and sense it. Breathe into the urge and try to dissolve it. Do not judge it. The urge will go away if you welcome it and sense it.
•	Check under the “new” tab in NoFap. Find someone who is struggling, and give them some encouragement. “That has NOT FAILED ONCE for me, so try it out.”
•	Every time you have the urge, do 25 push ups.
•	Read “Overcoming Cravings for Porn” https://blogs.psychcentral.com/sex-addiction/2013/07/overcoming-cravings-for-porn-and-addictive-sex/

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I would suggest that it's often because of this truism:  The body is an *instrument* (--which can be used as a Musical Instrument, a Megaphone, or for normal speech).

And when ""retrained"" to produce Music (that is, by people who didn't ""grow into"" singing naturally, on their own, when quite young), all voices tend to use the body as an instrument must-needs share certain aspects in order to produce ""perfect"" scales, clear vowel sounds, hard consonant ""breaks,"" resonance that isn't muffled or tinny or shrill, etc., and which is often structured on a new, more precise elocution/enunciation.  

And in learning this ""common instrument"" vocal ability, it becomes a *separate* mode of physical expression from ones normal speech.  

Now, there are great singers (from all countries) who are ""naturals,"" and have therefore retained what's recognizable from their everyday speaking --and ""elevated"" this expression to the level of Theater and Performance.

Others fall into a ""purist"" category, where their singing voice is an instrument that's separate from their everyday speech patterns.  One isn't necessarily better than the other.  It just depends on how much ""true heart"" is beating behind either way of singing.",1514764952

For the crease, use a fluffy blending brush and take a neutral shade (I normally go with a light brownish color) and using a windshield wiper motion, back and forth, put the color in the crease of your eye. You should be able to find the crease. Make sure you really blend the colors to create a beautiful look.

"SubredditDrama","t5_2ss5b","Well, to begin with, Puerto Rico does not get electoral votes in general presidential elections and it does not have voting representatives in Congress. Because it's a US territory and not a state. 

One example of why this matters: The Jones Act (Puerto Ricans have to pay nearly double for US goods through fees, taxes, and tariffs. And any goods shipped from one American port to another must be on American-made and -operated ships.) was enacted in 1920 by Congress. And Puerto Rico didn't get a vote on that. 

Puerto Rico declared a form of bankruptcy, which is indicative of how little the US government cares about the island. Puerto Ricans pay federal taxes but the government isn't doing much to protect the people who live there. Can you imagine the outrage if a state like Arkansas had to file bankruptcy and the federal government just went ""meh, whatever. You don't really count for much.""?",1514764958

You're 23, which is coming up on a pretty mature age to be able to handle being single for a bit and taking care of yourself after a breakup. You clearly sound like you hate being alone and need to have a girl in your life. This is not a good way to live, and it's only going to lead to more failed relationships in the future. Get over the breakup by yourself. Feel the pain, sadness, frustration, heartbreak, anger, whatever you feel. Don't rush it, and just let it all come to you, and leave with time. When you're past this, you're going to be stronger and smarter than you are now. You don't want to be any older and still feeling lonely without a girl in your life. It's just not healthy and not smart. I know guys like that who are 28, 30, who are bouncing from relationships to rebounds to relationships to a fling to a rebound to a relationship and it's honestly sad and pathetic. I think now, at your age, is a good time to really learn to enjoy your own company, the best kind of company to keep! That way, when you do get into a relationship when you're ready, you're going to be so secure, so not jealous, so ready to give love, so ready to receive what you want, and feel happier than ever before. So, I don't recommend jumping to this girl that's been waiting for you.

"DebateCommunism","t5_2vkao","My problem is with absentee landowners. I am less radical than some of my comrades in some ways-- I believe violence against *relatively* innocent people, such as landowners, and genuinely innocent people such as the ignorant or a-political, is unjustified. 

I would have a problem if someone just started trying to *tax me* for living in *my* home. That's what absentee landownership is. My home is my castle, et cetera, et cetera. Similarly, people farming a landlord's land and then paying a landlord ""for the privilege"" deserve to just own that land. The land owner can move onto his, her, or their own land if they'd like to keep it. In the USSR, this happened a lot, actually. Land owners said ""okay, fine, I'll work the land with my former tenants"" and people got along. Obviously, not every land owner came around in this way, but many of them did. This is the spirit of voluntary collectivization. 

If the landlord refuses to work, then the farmers or tenants will just ""squat"" and maintain the property they live on, landlord be damned. Think of it this way: a real estate mogul in New York owns an apartment building. He extracts rent from the tenants every month. The tenants live in the building and maintain the building. He, however, lives across the state line in New Jersey where he lounges on the beach extracting money from his tenants. He doesn't have a day job. One day, a Communist revolution breaks out and American society is turned on its head. The tenants decide they've had enough and stop paying their rent. The police are busy fighting the Revolution or have already surrendered in New York. The landlord is, naturally, pissed off that he can't get money for nothing anymore. He threatens to turn off the utilities if they don't pay up, and the tenants say, ""go ahead."" The tenants just pool their money and start paying their own water, heat, and electric bills- after all, it's cheaper than paying rent. The landlord calls the police but nobody will help him evict the tenants. The tenants have essentially created a collective without any violence. 

Now, in your view, the landlord would be justified in buying a gun and shooting up this apartment building, killing everyone. Who, in this scenario, is the violent maniac? The landlord. 

Voluntary collectivization (or essentially, peaceful coercion to live in a communal and egalitarian lifestyle) is unstoppable, nonviolent, and unproblematic. You may find it unfair but it is by no means genocide. If your problem is with violence, as was my problem with some of my more radical comrades, then the abolition of absentee ownership by peaceful occupation is a nonfactor. I kind of have you beat here. Either you admit that your problem isn't with ""genocide of landowners,"" but with wealth equality as an abstract concept, or you admit that voluntary collectivization is completely fine and that the ""genocide of landowners"" is much less of a tragedy than you are describing, and that you and your ilk would murder tenants over letting go of your stranglehold on their livelihood. 

Land reform and voluntary collectivization has *succeeded* all over the world. It succeeded in Spain just before the Civil War, it has succeeded in Southern Mexico, it is succeeding in Israel, et cetera. The Wikipedia page for [collective farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_farming) lists some examples of how voluntary collectivization has benefited agricultural communities. 

You are very much telling me oranges are orange whilst pointing *furiously* at an apple. Killing is bad, yes, but you just showed that you have no problem with it if it supports your own beliefs. Unless you want to walk that back, then *you're* the party tending towards maniacal violence.",1514764961

"homelab","t5_2ubz7","Basically I just want to be able to move steam game files around without wires (would this go against any data cap, however?) and I want to declutter my desk by having less single-purpose items clogging space and outlets - plus, I want to battery-protect my network stuff with it's own separate UPS (I have one currently for my desktop but I'm at the point where I may need to buy another and because of that I'm interested in maybe just centralizing all my networking stuff)

Also, I may be interested in creating my own app at some point for just my own use to run on my desktop and phone which I'm guessing would need to be stored on this server? (I don't want the information to go in it to be stored locally on my phone - it'd be for my finances)

I'm just a single person living in an apartment, so it's not like anyone would get upset with me if Plex didn't work (which I don't use anyways). I guess I'm really attracted to the idea of having everything that normally has its own processor and stuff compacted into one computer that if I update means I've updated for everything

"survivor","t5_2qhu3","I have every season available on DVD purchased, and the rest are currently downloaded onto my computer until I can purchase them. I've seen every season 3-8 times (sans HHH, will start my first rewatch of it soon). I hang out here, on the Funny115, on InsideSurvivor, the Wiki, on Sucks, etc etc. I have a lot of bookmarked tabs for websites that keep confessional counts per episode and season, records for challenge victories, etc. I also spend my time in courses that drag on writing down bootlists to pass the time and see how much of every season I can recall.

I STILL forget/miss a ridiculous number of details. The people who hop on here like, ""x player once slightly brushed their hair back as they passed by y, who was blinking exactly twice at that moment,"" scare me to death. That's an obvious exaggeration, but seriously, it's terrifying sometimes.

Also, going against me, I just got into watching Ponderosa videos (and I couldn't this season due to slow Internet connections), so I've been watching them through during my rewatches of seasons. I also just got into reading/watching interviews in the last two seasons or so, and again, couldn't do much recently in the way of videos because of a slow Internet connection. I've been getting corrected a LOT by people who are like, ""GO WATCH THEIR INTERVIEWS YOU IGNORANT SCUM,"" and I'm just over here like, ""Please pay for my connection upgrade and move me out of the middle of nowhere and we'll talk,"" lol. Besides that, my boyfriend and I are currently putting an old house together, but currently we live in a shared room and spend 24/7 together and Survivor is torture for him, so I can't sit here and watch it anytime unless I want to. XD

Long-winded way of saying that a lot of people here do watch/read/go over everything multiple times, and even in those cases, not everything is remembered. If you ever see those people who remember every second of every episode of every season and all of their interviews and Ponderosas, etc. you should probably just assume they either 1) looked it up right before posting, 2) live and breath nothing except Survivor, or 3) have a photographic memory. Also, note, I'm not being super serious. I realize some people in general just have a better memory than me without it being photographic or anything special, it was just an exaggerated way of making a point~ No offense intended to any of the mega super fans out there who do remember everything.",1514764962

A standard DT expand build that includes stalkers off 2\3 gate to hold early pressure and saving up gas to get blink+DT in time is probably a good idea even though that isnt a specific build.Since you are doing this against terran a robo after the twilight is probably needed as well but then you will have less stalkers to defend an eventual push before blink is ready.Basically do a standard  DT expand focusing all early units mainly stalkers and cut some  gas unit/upgrades to have enough gaz to go Twilight&gt;DTShrine&gt;Blink&gt;Robo following your gas amount to dictate whenever you get them making sure to never cut probe and it should already be a solid build IMO(Even if I think that dt blink is kinda wack vs terran).I am pretty sure that you can fit in a forge at some point during this but it makes failing doing damage a bit scarier if you commit gas to upgrades..with all the other gas heavy stuff you already making",1514764964

And with their rapidly rising middle class, which will want more white goods and the lifestyle that consumerism requires, I can't see taking a few cars off the road doing much except mitigating a number of unliveable smog-riddled cities.

"btc","t5_2si5v","&gt;The fees actually keep on rising... Do you not realize that literally means there are actually more and more people trying to use Bitcoin and are willing to pay large amounts of fees in order to do so? 

Yes of course. Fees have been rising exponentially because the rightward shifting demand curve of increased adoption is slamming into the vertical wall of an arbitrary supply quota. 

&gt;In what world is more and more usage a suicide?

Because the absurdly tiny limit on transactional capacity is like a collar around btc’s neck that is quickly turning into a noose as the network attempts to grow. The situation is obviously not sustainable. There are two ways it can end: (1) the supply limit is lifted or (2) demand stops growing and begins shrinking as btc’s increasingly broken functionality eventually causes people to abandon the network in favor of uncrippled alternatives.

it's built on the idea that progress and new habits are built a little at a time, small successes repeated daily - not big overwhelming changes in your lifestyle.

* Our banlist is [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/GOtrades/wiki/banlist). Check it before dealing with someone. It is updated every time someone gets banned. Please do not speak with a banned user, they have nothing good to offer you.
* It is highly discouraged to go first with any user. We provide a middleman service via our Discord. Our Discord link is [**here**](https://discord.gg/yXgDkaH). Join and request a middleman to assist with your trade. We try to provide an around the clock service.

Send us a modmail immediately if a user tells you that they do not want to use a middleman.
* No external links beside the link to your images.
* Fate Grand Order accounts only. We do not accept cross-trading here. Cross-trading may come to Discord only in the future, but it will never be allowed on the subreddit.

All of this might sound harsh, but its all in using what you get, to the max.

It became an obsession and I found lots of fun ones! Here they are seperated by category:

1- [Plates with clear intent to mean something, but unsure of meaning- make guesses in the comments!] (https://imgur.com/gallery/ed8V4)

2- [The title link, Plates that suggest a story hidden beneath the plate] (https://imgur.com/gallery/ed8V4)

3- [Of all the plates I came across, these I am convinced belong to Redditors] (https://imgur.com/gallery/cQV3Y)

4- [Plates that communicated the driver's interest of passion in various subjects/people/places] (https://imgur.com/gallery/r6unO)

5- [Subsection of #4 simply because it came up a lot- Plates dedicated to the driver's car] (https://imgur.com/gallery/3xB2P)

6- [Plates named after people, probably the drivers] (https://imgur.com/gallery/EsU2Y)

7- [Being a League of Legends Enthusiast, when I saw these plates I immediately thought of the game I play] (https://imgur.com/gallery/2oPoI)

8- [Lady Gaga has been in Alaska this whole time] (https://imgur.com/gallery/BaXr6)

9- [Funny how people on literally seperate sides of the planet can think of the same plate eh?] (https://imgur.com/gallery/zQCcM)

10- [Chinese Plates] (https://imgur.com/gallery/2QSIk)
In Chinese culture, a vanity plate generally uses a series of numbers, rather than letters to communicate an idea or belief. Examples include 888 = Longevity and quality of life, 666 = No not Satan, but instead wealth and prosperity. You will never see '444' because the number's sound is close to the character for death.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","""How do you distinguish between deism and atheism?""

I see two answers.

1. God is the basis for all that exists, and so the question is asking the difference between our current reality and sheer nothing (absence of any thing). In other words reality under the premise 'atheism is true' is impossible to conceive, once you have a proper definition of God (the self-sufficient act of being, existence itself, the source of all being).

2. If we ignore all philosophy for the past 3,000 years, *then* the answer becomes ""I don't know."" However, you presumably meant to ask about theism, not deism, since this forum is to debate *Christians*, in which case I would say there would not be Christianity today; the Church would have failed nearly 2,000 years ago along with the movements of other failed Jewish messiahs or other cult followings today that don't last. We would not hear claims of miracles on the news,* because of course they don't report about things that have absolutely no basis in reality (please read that literally: ""fake news"" is a different category, namely, lying about reality). I mean to say, for example, no one is publishing stories about Russell's teapot orbiting the sun, because of course there is no good reason to think it exists.

Motorcycles are one of those weird hobbies where its both niche and people go super deep. Everyone who rides them is searching for them, active in motorcycle communities, looking at reviews/video.

You don't need to advertise to them on broad platforms like television - my instagram, facebook, and youtube advertisements are all 50% targeted motorcycle ads.

The one example of motorcycle advertising that makes any sense is how Harley Davidson sponsors UFC - but never advertises specific motorcycles - instead advertising their riding academies. UFC on Fox gets 1-2 million viewers, FS1 ~500k and demographically probably makes much more sense for people who might be interested in motorcycle riding. Again - advertising a model is unnecessary.

Since I’m pegged to the epigraph already, let me also point out, Eliot originally wanted to quote **Joseph Conrad’s Heart of Darkness** for the epigraph

&gt; Did he live his life again in every detail of desire, temptation, and surrender during that supreme moment of complete knowledge? He cried in a whisper at some image, at some vision he cried out twice, a cry that was no more than a breath 

&gt; &gt; ""The horror! The horror!""


Pound *ruthlessly* edited out a lot of stuff (up to 80% in some sections), which Eliot did not object to.  So it seems noteworthy when Eliot made attempts to defend this when Pound says Conrad’s passage was “not weighty enough.”  Eliot argued (somewhat petulantly...) that it is

&gt; the most appropriate I can find, and somewhat elucidative.


Eliot eventually came up with [**Petronius’s Satyricon**](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5225/5225-h/5225-h.htm), presumably with the entire poem in mind, presumably with Pound’s objection in mind.  

So the question is, in what way is Kurtz’s passage relevant to the Waste Land, so much so that Eliot at first thought he cannot do without it.  In what way is the Satyricon scene similar to Kurtz’s death scene, and also relevant to the entirety of the Waste Land, so that it can successfully replace Conrad’s and still serve the same function in relation to the poem.

First, you have to realize the grandest fantasy in the world is still just a fantasy. Don't get me wrong, having an active sexual imagination is a great thing BUT you eventually have to commit. You're an object sitting on the bank of a river wondering how you'll ever make it to the sea. Meanwhile, the river is a roiling churning torrent. All you have to do is step into the water and you'll be carried away faster than you'd ever expect. Seriously.  


Here's what you need to do:


Fantasize - figure out what situations and circumstances arouse you the most. How do you dress, what do you do, who is there and what are they dong with you? ***You've clearly already done this***


Create - buy the clothes, groom your body, take photographs and put in all the prep work necessary for the next step. 


Realize - Go out and hook up with people.  Nothing will do a better job at transforming you into the sissy you want to be than actual slutty behaviour. That's meeting men in the flesh and making them cum. It's New Year's Eve and you could have two dozen men under your belt by summer. That'd mean you'd be confident in your body and your sexuality. You'd have regular daddy types who'd help transform you. You'd own that shit. 


Being a sissy is like higher education, you have to actually enroll, attend class, pay the fucking dues, submit the goddamn work. 


Sissy fantasyland is only the first sub step, minor movement, it needs to be built upon with tangible results. Clothing, encounters, accessories, cocks, sex positions, kinks, makeup, and other people's orgasms dripping off your face.",1514764978

Even still, it's only going to get worse as time goes on. Activision owns Blizzard, and Blizzard recently released Hanzo into Heroes of the Storm. What's funky about this release in particular? You can *only* obtain Hanzo's epic tier skins (previously buyable for other heroes with in-game currency *only* upon release) by buying them in a pack.

What you are saying is that everyone has the exact same body style, and given the same amount of work every single person would come out looking the same... how are you not seeing that that is just wrong. People are different, our physiques are different, our bone structure is different. Here is an example of what I’m talking about that might help clear up what I’m trying to say to you. Look at Channing tatums body. He has that “V” at his waist below his abs which is a characteristic that some male bodies do not have no matter how hard they were to try and achieve it, and yet that’s also a characteristic of what is considered the ideal body type. That’s all I’m saying here... that there are some physical characteristics you just can’t achieve with all the hard work in the world. And just so you know I have his body type, and with enough hard work I could look very much like him, so please don’t act like I’m some sad fucking loser just making up excuses as to why I will never look like that because it just isn’t true.

ElDewrito Dev Update (12/30/17)

rabidsquabbiteldewrito:

Happy Holidays! I know, I know, we didn’t make a blog post last week. It’s the holiday season, and just like you, we’ve been spending time with with friends and family, which takes much greater precedence over this game. We do, however, have plenty to update you on. 

Bug Fixes since last week:

Reverted bitmaps that cause freezing crashes from mipmap errors. (These were the main crashes mentioned last week)

Base map variant files have been updated (Weapon placements, spawn zones, ect)

Fixed Beam Rifle spread. (We accidentally had made it extremely innacurate. Oops.)

Cached infoserver response data every 5 seconds. (Increases performance)

Added push-to-talk noise toggle to settings 

Fixed some server variables not being written to preferences file.

Removed headshot sounds and effects. 

Enabled always ragdoll on death 

The AMD Freeze

As you may have seen from my Reddit post this week, we needed a bit of help from the community in getting testers with AMD cards to help us figure out the issue that causes the game to freeze; It’s easily the most complex issue we have come across in a long time. 

The process: Much of the rendering engine was stripped out. There was No lighting, no shadows, no effects, no water, no shield impact, no glass, no effect particles, no contrails, and the list goes on and on. With these features stripped out, unsurprisingly, the freeze did not occur anymore. Over the course of three days, these render features were slowly re-enabled one by one and tested in isolation. After many many hours, finally, the problem revealed itself in contrails.

What are contrails? Contrails are mostly used for trails on bullet projectiles e.g. sniper tracers. Many people have said that they believe it happens when they explode something, which actually turns out to be true. They are in-fact used on explosives. Here you can see contrails created from a fusion coil exploding: 

&lt;Couldn't copy paste the img...sry&gt;

The solution: With these contrails disabled, we’ve had zero reports of any freezing. It has been tested extensively by at least 30 people for hours at a time. While disabling these contrails, fixes the issue, it is not ideal. Particularly the sniper tracers as that directly affects gameplay, and could be said to give an advantage to non-AMD users. Fortunately, only the beam rifle seems to have this issue. We will continue to search for the exact cause and try to save these contrails for AMD users, but it’s proving to be very difficult. The exact cause of what makes the device crash has yet to be determined. 

However, we would like to thank you, the community, for helping us out with this. Over 50 community members volunteered their time to help us figure this thing out. There are many people we’d like to thank, but we’d especially like to thank a few of our testers, Rex706, Xennma, and JeBobs, who dedicated countless hours working directly with unk_1 trying to narrow down the cause. 


Q: Why haven’t you released yet? What is preventing you from releasing right now?

The new updater has made some more progress, but is not finished. We feel very strongly that an intuitive, bug-free, one-click updater is crucial to be included with 0.6. We still need to implement the ability for it to self-update, as well as skin the UI. Our estimate is that 15 development hours remain on it. 

As mentioned above, since the AMD freeze cause has been narrowed down to contrails, we need to finish up fixing it. 

And that’s pretty much it. The AMD Freezing issue was never a must-finish for us, but now that contrails have been identified to be the culprit and we are closer now than ever to having it fixed, we will fix it. Worst case scenario is that we have to add a setting to remove the offending contrails for AMD users. But releasing a game that doesn’t run on a GPU that holds 15% of the GPU market share while a fix is nearby would be pretty foolish.

One good solution is to run OpenVPN on Linux. There are easy to find guides on how to get this up and running in Ubuntu.

There are easier options such as just setting up an SSH server then tunneling your traffic through it as a socks proxy.  Also easily doable and easy to find guides for using Ubuntu.  

If you're daring and interested, search for Streisand VPN which is a complex scripted install of several security projects onto an AWS or Azure (and a couple others) hosted server under your control.

You  can try to set up a Windows based home VPN using PPTP.  There are some security implications that you'd want to research before going this route.

If you are simply trying to circumvent your corporate firewall restrictions, be aware that many corporations will block thus traffic so you will have to get creative in your configuration, like running SSH on port 443. 

Goof luck. I'm sure the regulars here will provide other info but that might get you started.

Neymar's absence is not the ultimate reason of Brazil's utter failure but it outlined how unprepared and emotionally unstable the team is when there is no one that can try and ""carry"" the game. They losing their shit after the second goal is the inevitable consequence, not the cause, of an uncoordinated team that relies too much on individual skill and talent.

Now I'm not saying it was always like this. Brazil has had better coordination as a team but that was due to it's players being so good that they could coordinate some plays just out of pure skill and knowledge of the game, as oposed to germany where their players learn not only by playing but also by studying football from a young age. In Brazil, tactics, formation and stuff are seen as bullshit and most players don't bother to study the game.

I know you're arguing that Brazil's emotional instability was not due to Neymar, what I'm trying to say is that that's exactly the problem, only enhanced by having our better player not being able to show up. The main reason we lost is our macro game is practically non existant and we rely on individual skill, not team coordination, in order to perform well, and when we lack individual skill (surely we didn't lack good players but they weren't better than the german players individually much less as a team) we simply don't have a reliable macro game where the average brazilian player could still do something (like position better, coordinate attack and defense better, how to connect attack and defense in different ways, etc.) so they just despair and burst out crying instead of holding the game and try to look for openings. This is just so clear in the 7x1 game where Brazil didn't even try to adapt, they just let the germans do the same thing over and over again and when they tried to react they would leave another open spot that would be exploited because Brazil simply had no clue what they were doing.

The copywriting around your e-book shows you don't understand this. All you advertise here is ""winning strategies"" with no mention of how to detect or avoid or correct early mistakes. Detect, avoid, correct.

2. Email

If your email collection is your #1 success metric, then the copywriting around your email collection should be the first thing you think about when working on this project.

What are you really promising here? Why not promise ""Never make another start-up mistake again"" or ""See which mistakes kill early stage projects""

Is promising weekly stories the most motivating thing you can think of???

You should also have multiple email collection opportunities throughout your articles.

Checkout: https://brianbalfour.com/essays/patreon-onboarding-growth for a good example.

Notice how the first one is after the intro of the article. Deliver value THEN ask for the email. There is another one in the middle and a third one near the bottom. Also, the one at the bottom of the page is a bit more intense and stands out. FOUR in total!

There, the producer would provide further detail about whatever production issue or concern he was having and I'd have to figure out what was causing it.  

Depending on the symptoms, it may include field scouting, pest samples, diseased tissue collection/cultures, tissue samples for nutrient analysis, soil nutrient testing (macro/micro/pH), soil sampling for contaminants, water quality testing, field/plot photographs, etc...   Once collecting all that was appropriate and making a diagnosis, I'd work with the producer to establish and implement a sustainable management plan that corrected the issue(s), both short and long-term.

I do have experience with various types of tillage.  No till and strip till more so.  Less damage to the natural soil structure, less erosion, less water loss and runoff, less nutrient and topsoil losses, particularly beneficial in windy regions.  It was something I really emphasized and pushed when I worked in NW Oklahoma.  Tried to encourage crop rotation with no or minimal till methods to reduce nutrient loss and fertilizer application, too, with moderate success (Rhizobium inoculated legumes for N production, off-season cover crops &amp; ""green manure"", balanced livestock integration, etc...).

Far as marijuana goes, I expect that once it has been legalized throughout the U.S., production will become more diverse and balanced across previously traditional farming demographics.  Once retail prices balance out and the astronomical profits stabilize with competition, it will not be as profitable to continue the trend of excessive water and chemical inputs associated with controlled hydroponic and greenhouse production.  I figure sustainable farming will become a cannabis industry norm and necessity in the years to come. ",1514764986

"space","t5_2qh87","**Tidal locking**

Tidal locking (also called gravitational locking or captured rotation) occurs when the long-term interaction between a pair of co-orbiting astronomical bodies drives the rotation rates into a harmonic ratio with the orbital period. This effect arises from the gravitational gradient (tidal force) between the co-orbiting bodies, acting over a sufficiently long period of time. Once tidal locking is achieved for one of the bodies, there is no more net transfer of angular momentum between the two objects, although there can be some back and forth transfer over the course of an orbit. In the special case where the orbital eccentricity is nearly zero, tidal locking results in one hemisphere of the revolving object constantly facing its partner, an effect known as synchronous rotation.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","Your criticism about eternal punishment by God is a lot less specific to islam and there is a lot of literature on that so I would rather not discuss that too much

I will note though that the quran says some of it is analogy and some of it is literal

When it discusses paradise with rivers and beautiful men and women etc it tells us that the descriptions throughout are only a mathal or allegory

Likewise I believe that hell is described as a mathal as it logically follows that we cannot understand heaven or hell

I do not believe that heaven or hell is a physical place or a place at all so much as it is a feeling

Unfortunately being trapped in an evil thought for eternity sounds just as bad if not worse than being burned

Essentially heaven is nearness to God which if you believe in Him as the sustainer means complete peace and satisfaction

Hell is eternal distance from God and those who did not believe in Him will get exactly what they always believed and wanted which is a realm without God_or rather a realm where He is so distant you are forsaken and left to suffer the torment of your own consciousness

Again just my interpretation and tbh i do not normally come here to preach my idiosynchratic views but to vent about the predominant views like many exmuslims do

I have suffered too from regular fiqh and still struggle with that trauma trying to navigate my own beliefs

your last question is the thing I personally struggle with the most perhaps even the only thing that might break me as I cannot imagine any time where crucifixion would ever be appropriate because it means humans are inflicting unnecessary suffering

I have read some interpretations that say because that verse is in the subjunctive tense it is not a command but a theoretical statement that people deserve those punishments but not that they should actually be enforced

However I am not convinced and see that as apologetics because the verse is too specific and has a list of less severe punishments like exile

I honestly do not know what to make of it as it contravenes my internal fitrah of right and wrong yet I can honestly accept everything else in the quran",1514764988

"r4r","t5_2rn0e","Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/r4r because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/comments/z08ap/how_you_should_tag_your_r4r_posts/).

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Obviously, whether or not to go all 5 days is a bit of a subjective thing (your budget, your schedule, etc. all matter). But, in my opinion, you should absolutely go all 5 days. Each of my two years I flew in on Tuesday evening and left Monday morning so I had all of Wednesday-Sunday available for the con. But, if I could've swung it I would have really enjoyed going even a few days earlier as fans show up and get into the spirit of things days before the con officially starts!

All panels are ""free"" (with convention ticket), and if you have a certain level of all-week ticket (Copper and up, for sure, but possibly even some cheaper levels) then you have a reserved seat in the main hall to guarantee you'll see any panel you want to! The secondary hall is smaller but generally the demand for panels in that room is lesser to where it isn't an issue.

There are two types of autographs to pay for: ones that require tickets and ones that don't. The ones that don't are almost always $40-50, but there are exceptions both higher and lower. The ticketed autographs can be in that price range, but the big stars (think TOS cast, Sir Patrick, etc.) can be triple that price.

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses ""()"" or braces ""{}"" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only ""[W]"" but not also ""[H]"" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.

For calorie burn, I’d recommend reducing your rest time between sets, which will keep your heart rate elevate throughout the workout. The RR recommends 90-180 seconds I think. Rather than upping your reps/sets, since you’re looking to build strength. Think if it this way, the type of exercise you do will condition that muscle to excel at that type of exertion. I.e. high reps/sets will make those muscles good at doing lots of movements of moderate exertion. Low sets/reps with more resistance will condition those muscles to excel at exerting more force.

Jaune awakens his semblance, which makes him like a fully fledged tank knight, with temporary invulnerability, which gives him time to fend off Cinder, Spring and go to Weiss.

She joins Jaune and take Weiss to a safe place, swearing that she will not allow another of her friends down. Jaune goes back, with renewed confidence, and take one of the maidens down (with the help of the others). 

Oscar makes Leo falter in his conviction of being free of the duty of being a headmaster and guarding the relic and defeats him, with the help of Ozpin, and goes to protect the relic, as Spring goes to retrieve it.

You really don't.  It seems you're confusing personal experience for objective fact.  I'm going to wager that you're not sitting down with an excel spreadsheet and strictly counting each and every stone you get.

&gt;Also for battlefield, they said it’s coming back 

Uh huh.  Yeah, companies say a lot of things.  Also note that they said it's coming back.  As in coming back to Japan.  No word on it coming to Global.

&gt;And for exclusives, all the free ones sucked, only hero ones were good 

Aside from the fact that doesn't matter, exclusives are exclusives, I've addressed this point already and will now just copy/paste what I said last time.  I already addressed this. Yes, most of the exclusives are bad NOW. They weren't when they launched on JPN and when they should have launched on Global. Releasing them now, yes, they're useless.

Also, train your staff. It's great to say the lawyer/paralegal/whoever is ""LGBT/trans friendly"", but if the receptionist answering the phone or emails is not (or is not aware of how to handle names/pronouns/etc), you're going to give off the impression that you're not the place for trans people before they ever speak to the legal professional.

"asktransgender","t5_2r4b9","&gt;These examples are from other countries. 

The first one is, the second one is from interviews conducted all over America and is particularly of interest to me because of the firsthand experiences that were shared.

&gt;In my personal experience, the hatred towards butch women is more from women themselves. 

Women are absolutely complicit in throwing GNC AFAB people (and FtMs) under the bus but they don't participate in the same culture of sexual violence against them to nearly the same degree.

&gt;Sometimes you get cockbite guys who have an issue, but they mostly ignore than make outright threats. If men do make outright threats, it's more because of rape culture/misogyny.

The physical and sexual threats I've received both when I presented as a GNC woman in my youth and later when I came out as trans were overwhelmingly from guys. I learned pretty early on that being in places at school where I could be cornered by guys was dangerous, because those were the places where young men thought they could overpower and threaten me with sexual/physical assault. As I grew older and started passing and living life as a passing but openly trans man the nature of the threats changed from ""I'm going to rape you until you accept your inner feminine nature"" to a weird, disgusting mix of ""I'm going to rape you until you accept that you're a *woman*"" and outright homophobia, treating me like some weird homuculus mixture of ""*true* woman"" and ""yeah but he's pretty masc so this feels kinda gay"".

I've read some of your other comments though and I don't know that I'd like to continue a conversation with you unless you can tone that shit down. Talk about being rude and dismissive, not only of nonbinary people (""transmasculine"" is being used by those of us who don't wish to alienate those who don't feel comfortably in the binary) but of the trans male experience in general. There's always at least one of this type of person who try to push back against the lived experiences of trans men and simultaneously claim that any violence that happens to us is for any reason *besides* transphobia or violence for being perceived as GNC, and yet also claim that there *is* no real issues of violence going on either.

It's not a race to who is most oppressed, I and most other trans men will be the first to say that yes, trans women have it worse on several issues, but the community has ended up pushing this rhetoric *to the exclusion* of trans men. Trans men are more likely to be the poorest of the poor in society. Trans men are more likely to attempt suicide. Trans men report having more issues in the medical system in some ways including not receiving transition related care. Etc. Etc. Etc. Somehow ""trans women are more visible and therefore have some more visible issues"" has turned into an attitude of ""trans men have no problems and basically have amazing transitions and never experience transphobia or really any problems of note and any trans guy who speaks up is just a whiny fuck trying to steal resources away from trans women"".

If that's coming at it from a ""distinctly feminine conditioning"" (seriously what the fuck dude, talk about misogyny), well then fuck me I guess. We talk about rape because it's a huge problem in the FtM community that is swept under the carpet and ignored almost entirely by the larger community and even the FtM community sometimes.

We *are* invisible, but invisible doesn't mean un-victimizable. It just means the violence and assault committed against us is as ignored and invisible as we are.",1514765007

For ex., after the reports of Schürrle seeking a transfer to other clubs, Gotze posted a pic on his instagram story with him (center), Auba (top), Schürrle (left) and Reus (right), which I thought that it’s his preference of squad over other players. Reus seems to get along with most players. Also, foreigners as well as players around the same age tend to get together, which is normal. Besides, it’s not surprise to see foreigners being together since the club treats Germans vs foreigners differently. Both Watzke and Zorc said that they’ve been trying to solve, but it’s been difficult. However, I think that the club’s attitude sometimes makes certain players to think that they are more influential than other players and even a coach. For ex.,  Schmelzer (Bender and Reus too?) criticised TT about not including Sahin in the squad at Pokal final. Ginter, who played at Sahin’s position, became a target of German media and ended up leaving the club.

"worldpowers","t5_30yfr","The Toad had apparently made his last leap, once again escaping from Xi Jinping's clutches seeking freedom. This old man's journey had been terrible, escaping from dangers of immeasurable size. But that was not over. The moon shone in the sky as the former President of China fell to the ground, exhausted. For a moment he closed his eyes, thinking that this was his end, but a yellow light was perceived, and a voice called his name. An almost divine voice, sweet, calm. A voice familiar to the former President, a voice of someone who had died many years ago.

*Zemin, Zemin...*

When he opened his eyes, [Jiang Zemin saw nothing less than the *Revolutionary Spirit of Korea's Dear Leader*, *Respected Leader*, *Wise Leader*, *Brilliant Leader*, *Unique Leader*, *Sun of the Communist Future*, *Shining Star of Paektu Mountain*, *Guiding Sun Ray*, *Symbol of the Fatherland's Unification*, *Ever-Victorious, Iron-Willed Commander*, *World Leader of The 21st Century*, *Great Man, Who Descended From Heaven*, *Highest Incarnation of the Revolutionary Comradeship*, *General* ***Kim Jong-Il***](http://aimhighincreation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/26.-Kim-Jong-Il-poster-web1-710x400.jpg). And, in addition, also [Dear Friend of Jiang Zemin](https://f.i.bol.com.br/imagensdodia/fotos/20111219-ditador-coreano_f_034.jpg).

*It's not over yet, Zemin. The Revolutionary Flame must remain lit, and you, my friend, have it inside you.*

The Dear Leader put his hand on Jiang Zemin's forehead and then slowly disappeared into the air in small light particles that were carried by the wind. After the spirit disappeared, Zemin heard other voices from afar, and the lanterns attached to the AK-12s of the Korean soldiers who patrolled the frontier spotted the former President. The sound of several steps crushing old leaves was heard, approaching more and more.

**There he is, there he is!**

The soldiers put their weapons on their shoulders and lifted Jiang Zemin and put him on a stretcher they had brought in to help. The news had spread, and when Korean workers in China spotted the former President, information was passed on to DPRK. The soldiers rushed forward, taking Zemin to several doctors who treated him enough to ensure that he would be alive until he reached Pyongyang. After being quickly treated, Zemin was put in a military truck that left for Pyongyang, Kim Il-Sung University.

As for the apparent beast who hunted the former President from Mongolia to Korea, some guards led by Comrade [Ri Myung-hun](https://www.google.com.br/search?q=Ri+Myung-hun&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwif3dSDu7XYAhVIGpAKHSdaAj0Q_AUICigB&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=731) searched the frontier for it.",1514765013

I don't love the style of the Fearne, so I may cut that out of the equation even if the fit is okay. Which leaves me with the Envy in 34E or 34F and the Marcia in 34F. I will reorder the Envy in a 34F if you think it looks like a better fit than the 34E given the photos.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;He was homeless and the general public chanted “crucify him!” as they pardoned a convicted murderer instead of him. How is that not a reject? Sure he had a small group of followers, but he certainly lived in the conditions of poverty and had an abundance of enemies. 

He was homeless and in poverty by choice, I suppose. You said yourself that he could make a living and didn't need charity. In that case, if being homeless and in poverty made him a reject, it was by his choice.

Having a group of followers hanging on your every word, literally totally devoted to you, and providing you with financial means doesn't constitute a ""reject"" to me. That would make him more successful than 99% of everyone who ever lived.

I don't think it's said the number of people who chanted for his crucifixion, but it might have been only a small portion of the town he was in.

I'd venture to guess the woman didn't offer her gifts because he was a poor reject. She offered them because she thought he was Holy and powerful.

I'm not going to wait and let you have a huge advantage over me, especially if I wasn't able to get an execution on your teammate. If I can interrupt your execution I will. 

However, doing a heavy attack, a ledge, or some sort of special move like a charged heavy while someone is executing is a HUGE dick move that's as bad, if not worse than ganking in Brawl. 

I always do an empty GB (or a light if I really need to) to interrupt an execution. Then, I back off and emote to let them get their bearings.

He was kind of a funny guy so he put his sweater on backwards. he was trying to unzip the back since his friend zipped it up for him. and I didn't really notice because I forgot he put it on backwards so he was trying to take it off because he got super hot. So I ran over and gave him a big hug because that was the best ever actually ever done in a race. Sadly one of the teachers notice.

With 3 big dogs: 
no one else can/wants to walk them when you're away or injured, 
big dogs require a big car for transport (vets/outings), 
big dogs make big messes - hair everywhere, sand on the floor everywhere, muddy paw prints everywhere. 
Plus they dig big holes and do big poops.
Big dogs cost more to worm and medicate. (Big dogs food requirements though are surprisingly low. About 2 cups of dry feed a day).  Big dogs cost more to wash and groom and grooming the arctic breeds is an arduous and messy task.
Poorly trained big dogs are a danger to themselves, their handlers and their owners.

That being said I love having 3 big dogs even though they do impact my ability to relocate (I can't rent with them so I need to own wherever  I live) and my ability to travel (no one's that keen to look after 3 big dogs and kennelling 3 big dogs is expensive).

Specifically what you do or get from the club is really up to what you *want* to get from it; same for the healslut community in general. If you just think healing is a cute thing, you can fantasize about it in your free time and with others around here. If you're looking for friends to play games with sharing some similar interests, you can probably find some. 

If you're concerned about how to approach healslutting with a partner in-game, I can recommend the Discord, as well as the looking for partner megathread links in the sidebar here on the subreddit. As for the club you're in, don't be shy! Ask in the group chat if anyone would like to play a healslut game or if anyone is interested in healslutting. Nobody will be mean to you. They're all in the same group you're in, after all! The only thing I don't advise is just opening random IMs and trying to boss people around into healslutting, as that can be rather uncomfortable for the sub/other person if they aren't interested.

It’s my first cicle with the small Lena too, and I totally relate with the getting frustrated thing. I put it on last night and I could totally feel it, constantly wanted to pee, instantly had horrible cramps and leaking, so something was obviously wrong. Reinserted it and felt better, but still kept leaking and could feel it. Currently I’ve reinserted it about 5 times during the day and I still can feel it to the point that I don’t think I could work out with this thing on, idk if it’s my fear of it getting stuck or something, but i constantly feel it and can’t forget about it. I also leaked every time I had to reinsert it. 
Did you try using your fingers to check how was your cervix, if your could feel it, as well as your vaginal canal walls? Did this the last time I reinserted it and it made me feel more confident that it was in the right place and could feel it less, also had less leakage.

I think (and hope) that this is a getting used to thing that improves with practice, as well as getting to know better our inside lady parts, because I really want it to work for me.

Hypergamy is no longer closeted.

These cunts are now moving it out in the open as so many blue-pilled beta-cucks continue to wrongly identify with the feminine, thinking this will get them some filthy pussy.  All this is doing is indoctrinating them deeper into becoming feminized cunts themselves and making the very objects of their desire simultaneously despise them more.

Now, these assholes, in their own defective minds, have both a reason as well as a license to cheat.  Look, if a cunt wants to fuck something feminine, its going to fuck another woman, not a Man.  There's no complicated formula in that.

And here is where the feminine imperative again changes lanes, moves the goal posts.  Cuckoldry will become something these entitled cunts demand a man accepts in a relationship more and more often and with increasing aggressiveness.  This open level of hypergamy will lead in very short order to Men being forced to accept cuckoldry as their new norm, as a cunt's prerogative.",1514765025

I've been taking simethicone and stool softeners daily for the past week due to the pain. After doing some literature searches, it seems as if there are a lot of gastric issues that are treated with Robinul, so it's likely that my doctor will be familiar with it. I'm a bit sad worrying that this is, in fact, the cause of my stomach issues... Glyco has been such a lifesaver and anxiety-reliever for me.

2. We do not ascribe thoughts or beliefs onto our partner that they do not think or believe. Take the person at their word.

"ProductTesting","t5_38vtu","These days, you cannot review free samples on Amazon within their rules.

Once you get more followers on YT, or your blog, you can reach out directly to suppliers through their website / email / etc. But YMMV here.


Many people break these rules and review free samples on Amazon to receive more free stuff. 


I wouldn't recommend breaking those rules. In the past Amazon has sued reviewers who got paid to review on their platform. **Paypal refunds are a form of payment, and may cause tax liabilities too**. Plus it makes shopping online a worse experience for everyone if you're just shilling for free samples.

Two renders that you have linked show different grip than the one shown here. Heck, the grip is different even on each render. To me it looks like VKB is testing various layout designs, but that doesn't mean the final throttle will have those extra HATs. Even if they put something there, it may be quite hard to operate them comfortably.

Or consider this: Are they financially responsible? If they were, they wouldn't have a need for 10k from you, honestly. One thing I'm learning as I grow up is people with debt think they just need more money to solve their problems. But what they need are lifestyle changes. Buy less alcohol, eat out less, don't buy starbucks, pack lunches more, work consistent jobs with promised pay, don't use credit-card unless you're treating it like your using cash out of your account, keep track of your expenses and earnings.

Take some time and consider how you could use that 10k and invest it in a way that will help optimize their lifestyle - what people with debt really need isn't always money - if it really were, they would never be in debt to begin with.

What if you showed up once a weekend and cleaned out their garage? Or helped with gardening? Or repainted rooms in their house? Or showed up with groceries asking them to meal prep new meals with you, while also leaving them with a few weeks worth of food. Or just simply spend the money to spend more time with them.

I imagine if it comes to the point all Elves seem to be the same, it's because they're being treated as a culture rather than as a species. The simple fact of being isolated or distant enough will turn any group into their own culture.

One interesting thing I like and is related to this topic is transracial culture: cultures with more than one race. It's very fun to imagine a single culture adhered to by a variety of races, each with possibly some caveats, but still seen as 'belonging' by the others (even if it may involve some kind of speciest hierarchy or what have you).",1514765034

Whataboutism (also known as whataboutery) is a variant of the tu quoque logical fallacy that attempts to discredit an opponent's position by charging them with hypocrisy without directly refuting or disproving their argument, which is particularly associated with Soviet and Russian propaganda. When criticisms were leveled at the Soviet Union, the Soviet response would be ""What about..."" followed by an event in the Western world.

The term ""whataboutery"" has been used in Britain and Ireland since the period of the Troubles (conflict) in Northern Ireland. Lexicographers date the first appearance of the variant whataboutism to the 1990s, while other historians state that during the Cold War Western officials referred to the Soviet propaganda strategy by that term.

"steelers","t5_2r526","What I'm trying to explain to you is that you need a combination of both yards, points allowed, and numbers both with and without outside factors like ST. If you solely rely on yardage like you've said, you're not going to be accurate and leaving yourself misinformed about the actual strength of a defense and in seeming denial of the existence of successful bend-don't-break defenses which is ridiculous. ESPN and NFL stats aren't held as all that reputable if we're being honest, too. PFF accounts for things like tipped balls on INTs, dropped but catchable passes and a myriad of details that far qualify it over the likes of ESPN and NFL, in fact you'll see PFF quoted frequently on TV because their analysis typically affords a ton of positive discussion.

And if points allowed still seems so questionable to you, it's simple enough to find them excluding outside non-defensive factors and ranked, there are a ton of *far* better statistical sites than NFL and ESPN which themselves are pretty basic. Even in that comment chain you linked there's agreement that yardage isn't to be the sole determining factor of defenses, they even linked PFF a few times for a more in-depth look.

You seem interested in the analytics of it all, I'd suggest trying the free trial for PFF. It's only a month I think but you'll learn a ton, you don't want to be thought of as a knowledgeable football lover and reduce defensive rankings to something as simple as less yards = better defense. ST and INTs that enhance a defense's ranking really aren't so disruptive as to leave them inaccurate like I said before.

You can be sure that if ranking defenses were as easy as less yards = better defense then many stat sites like PFF would have a fuckton less to write about. Just don't oversimplify it because it's inaccurate, and don't hang your hat on ESPN and NFL stats to really make your point. You won't be taken very seriously if you go about using just one measure to rank such a complicated concept. I hate it when people have just decided they don't need to learn more about something. They're always wrong. I don't think you're like that though, you wouldn't be googling things and looking through first result shit like ESPN and NFL stats if you didn't care.",1514765036

"history","t5_2qh53","I think it's important to note that the role hindenburg and ludendorff played at Tannenburg is generally exaggerated, perhaps grossly so.

1) the German response to the Russian invasion was almost completely predicted by pre war German staff wargames.

2) the orders to implement the force rotation, as anticipated by the pre war wargames, were already issued and the movement underway before ludendorff and hindenburg took command.

3) the extreme success of the German efforts at Tannenburg can be attributed significantly (other than Russian incompetence) to the tendency of General François to ignore the orders he received from ludendorff and go with his own evaluation of the situation. It is unlikely that the Germans would have trapped second army in such a pocket had François followed orders.

&gt;MADISON, Tenn. -- A 12-year-old girl has been charged with criminal homicide in Davidson County.

&gt;The teen is accused of the overnight shooting of a 16-year-old girl at the Falcon View Apartments on East Palestine Avenue in Madison just before 3:30 a.m. Metro Nashville police have identified the victim as Brentrice Wilson.


&gt;A group of juvenile girls were inside the grandmother's apartment, then reportedly sneaked out without her knowledge. They burglarized an unlocked vehicle and stole a loaded semi-automatic pistol, bringing it back to the residence, according to police. The 12-year-old was reportedly handling the gun when it went off while pointing it at other girls.

&gt;The girl is being charged with criminal homicide, after consultation with the District Attorney's Office. The investigation is ongoing.

After all, a mother that doesn’t feed her child probably isn’t holding it much either, but I’d wager the more likely cause of death there is starvation/dehydration.

I disagree that this is a resource we should be looking to create market conditions for, entirely.

Sorry, *norwegian* fashion fans, not *russian*. That makes it better. 

&gt;it's about staying warm and avoiding frostbite.

Which can be accomplished, easily, without seals. How many people on the summit of Mount Everest do you see dressed in seal? How about antarctic researchers? None? Good, that's what I thought. farmed down, especially molted down, like what is used by Patagonia and Canada goose, is an insulator far superior to anything you strip off an infant seal.

"Aquariums","t5_2rc6i","It comes down to a couple of things really, first is water quality, the more fish you cram in a space the faster water goes bad which means you need to be on the ball with water changes and providing the best water quality you can. Hand in hand with this there is also stability, fish do better with stable conditions so if your need to keep your nitrates under 20ppm and they hit that mark every 2 days then you need to be doing more frequent changes so that there isn’t much of a swing, maintaining 10ppm is better than it going for 0 to 40 and then back to 0 etc.

You also need to take in the physical requirements of the fish, active swimmers need longer tanks (3-4’ etc) whereas something like a bottom dweller will do better with a tank with more surface area. Also need to take into consideration plants, caves etc that the fish may need to feel safe and secure.

Everything really comes down to the type of fish you are keeping and how much time/effort you are going to be putting into it. ",1514765043

"worldbuilding","t5_2rd6n","***This is a recent post I made to the forum for the Conclave of Aldemeria worldbuilding Minecraft server about the ruling Houses of my realm.***

There are many noble and non-noble ruling Houses of Viðrlond. As of 45 YC, there are 6 noble houses, and numerous non-noble houses with 3 of those considered important enough to warrant discussion in this document. 


**House Viðrcynn**

House Viðrcynn reigns as the supreme noble house of the realm of Viðrlond. Originally the Hlaford of Ent Farthing, House Viðrcynn has for some time ruled over the other Houses of the current realm. Their crest contains an Östron runic symbol that contains the runes for trees, and the runic symbol for all Östron tribes.


**House Fleotwudu**

House Fleotwudu rules as the noble house of Smarragd. House Fleotwudu has long been considered a branch of House Viðrcynn, as their long history of marriages has give each house claims on one another's thrones. Should the Viðrcynn line die out, it is like the rest of the realm would accept a Fleotwudu Hlaford as the new ruler of the realm. Their crest contains the Östron runes for the letters ""F"" and ""W"".

 
**House Truhtcynn**

House Truhtcynn is a non-noble house that is notable due to their few marriages to various leaders of House Viðrcynn. They rule the lands around Truhtspryng. Their crest contains the Östron runic symbol turned on its side, stylized like a fish. 


**House Folcwine**

House Folcwine is a very powerful noble house that rules from Vatnklippe. House Folcwine was the first noble house to pledge fealty to House Viðrcyn (House Fleotwudu was given noble status many centuries after they pledged fealty). Their crest contains the Ösron runes for ""V"" and ""K."" 


**House Gaardel**

House Gaardel was once the chief rival of House Viðrcynn, until a noble marriage sealed their fate as a vassalized noble house. House Gaardel rules from the garden-fortress village of Lustgaard. Their crest contains the ancient symbol of Lustgaard - a central fortress with many sectioned gardens. 


**House Hwætalu**

House Hwætalu is a non-noble house that rules from the hamlet of Hwæteford, a significant wheat producing and trading hamlet long vassalized by House Viðrcynn. Their crest contains the Östron rune for the wheat harvest. 


**House Thorbjon**

House Thorbjon is a new noble house of the forest elves in the west, ruling from Stokkrlundr. Their crest contains their ancient symbol of twin halberds. 


**House Romson**

House Romson is a non-noble house that rules from the fortress village of Rostgava. A rather new house founded by Thane Wyn Romson, it is expected they shall rise to nobility soon for their efforts in the recent wars. Their crest is the personal symbol of Thane Wyn Romson. 


**House Blæcynn**

House Blæcynn is a very powerful noble house that House Viðrcynn force vassalized in the recent Great Eastern War. They rule over much of the east of the realm, ruling from the village of Blæcwyrt. Their symbol is the Östron rune for a type of tree in combination with the Östron rune for ""B.""",1514765043

"latterdaysaints","t5_2uas2","Or, Genesis is an oral history that was written down generations after any person who might have had an insiders' view was long gone. The book of Genesis was traditionally written by Moses. Rabbinic experts put Moses at 1500-1300 BC, which, even if you are using a strictly literal interpretation of scripture, is thousands of years after the flood the fall, etc. 

I think there is room for the people who see the scriptures as only literal texts and those who view them as largely symbolic. The church is silent on the age of the earth. We don't have a concrete evidence of when or how long things took. You can point to things like the timeline bookmark I got in seminary to say, ""This is what the church teaches"", but the church has never claimed to be a scientific authority. They are a religious entity. They are in the business of teaching the why, not the how.

That's what it ultimately boils down to for me. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't matter if the flood literally happened, or Moses actually led hundreds of thousands out of Egypt, or Adam lived nearly 7000 years ago. The moral lessons are the thing that matters. 

And there's room in the narrative to add in time. Look at list of ancestors of Jesus, given in the Gospels. They contain different sets of names and are missing generations. Some of them are accounted for by saying how many generations passed, but others aren't. There's certainly a few possibilities when it comes to all the begats that would say someone is the ""son"" of someone, but they are actually the third-great-grandson.

All this to say, we don't have to be completely literal.",1514765045

My friends and I just have an understanding that we don't have to reply to each immediately. We are also comfortable texting again, even if the other person hasn't responded. If it gets to be more than 3 or 4 days, then we sometimes specifically will tell the other person that we're getting worried and ask them to reply.

"roblox","t5_2rnsh","I mean, I'm not drowning in money with my scripting skills, but this is what I did to get moderate skill in it.

1. Use free models and play around with it, be sure you analyze the scripts. [I made some scripts that are useful for building obbies here](https://www.roblox.com/library/337091115/Obby-kit). Warning, I haven't updated the scripts so some are broken. They also work best with r6 characters.

2. **Resources**: The best resources are of course the Roblox Wiki where it has a plethora of information in scripting. Some are very hard to understand for beginners, so I recommend starting with the tutorials on the website for beginners. 

Otherwise here are some video tutorials

[Official Roblox website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSQQ9ZchtzE)

[AlvinBlox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5fcCKEvp6Q)

[PeasFactory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3dbJXSa12Q)


3. **Help**: So you have two subreddits to go to for scripting help, this subreddit and /r/robloxgamedev. Otherwise, the most helpful might be [script helpers](https://scriptinghelpers.org/). You can ask any questions about scripting as long as you are very descript in what you want. Of course, having help from other people are one of the best assets you can have, I personally began scripting when I recieved lessons from user egomoose. 

4. **Vocabulary and concepts**: Honestly if there is one hill that is hard to overcome in scripting, its the concepts. So here are some basic terms to know in slightly inaccurate, but very comprehensible descriptions. 

Scripts: Contains a list of orders you tell to the game and the game will read down the list when the game starts. The Game is kinda stupid in the sense that it doesn't have common sense, so it is your job to explain everything to the game.


**Reference**: This is not the technical word for it, but in the game, you need to specify what object [Objects in games are called ""Instances""] you want something to happen. You do this through going through the hierarchy of the game, or what you see in the Explore tab of the studio, and going down. You can start a reference through ""game.[What's down the heiarchy]"" or ""script.[What you are referencing relative to where the running script is]"". Whenever there is something like ""script.Parent"" this means that the script is referencing whatever the script is contained in.

For example, tell any normal person if they know a guy named ""Joe"". They would not know who they are. So instead you specify who Joe is, so you say something like, ""Do you know, in Planet Earth, In The U.S., In the state Colorado, In Denver, Who works in a Ski Resort, Joe?"". Just like how you need to specify who/what something is, you need to specify what you are referring to the game.


**Function**: An order you give the game so that it will perform it once you call for the script. Usually, you call it by writing the name of the function and two parentheses like so "":[Name of the function]()"". Ex: :print(), :kill()

Some useful Functions to remember are
- :FindFirstChild()

- :WaitForChild()

- :print() &lt; This one is useful for finding errors in your script

- :Destroy()

- :Clone()

- :GetPlayerFromCharacter()

- :Lerp()

- :connect() &lt; This script is necessary if you want to ""connect"" a function to a certain event.

- :GetChildren()

- :SetPrimaryPartCFrame()



**Condition**: Conditions checks the condition whatever is in the game so it can decide what to do. You can make conditions through writing ""if [condition] then [What you want to happen when the condition is true]"". If you see the word ""else"" as a condition, it means what will happen otherwise if the condition is not happening. 


**Loops**: Loops tell the game to repeat certain things in the game until a certain condition is met, or a certain condition persists. There are ""For"" loops, ""Repeat"" loops, ""While"" loops, and ""For in pairs()"" loop. I'm not going to explain them all here, but the Roblox wiki explains each really simply. 


**Parameter**: So in a function remember those two parentheses? Well, if you took Algebra in high school you probably saw something like this

f(x) = x+2

Parameters are what you plug in the function to give the result of f(x). It's like a game of mad libs, the writing doesn't make sense until you plug in the missing spaces with the proper word type, otherwise, it will give off an error. 


**Event**: What the game waits for in order to perform the function. The most useful functions tend to be "".Changed"", "".Touched"", "".MouseClick"", "".PlayerAdded"", "".CharacterAdded""and "".Event"", at least those tend to be the events I frequently use. 


**Value type**: So there a lot of values to keep track of. Again, the game is kinda dumb in the sense that it lacks common sense. So you need to be specific what value type it is. Values are important because Properties on an object has Values which you change to make a full-fledged game. Here are some important ones

- Numbers/int/float/double: These values are just numbers, so you can't change these values to letters otherwise you get an error. Just like how 2+2 makes sense but 2 + Moose doesn't make mathematical sense. 

- String: It means words and sentences. You cannot plug these values in a mathematical expression directly unless you convert them to numbers values. 

- Bool: True and False statements. This value only exists in two states, and it's useful for conditions.

- Vector3: These are unique numeric values as they are used in properties such as Objects in 3d space. If a value is represented as ""x,y,z"" then most likely it is a Vector3 value.

- CFrame: So this is usually mistaken for Vector3, but they are just a much more nuanced version of it because they contain information about the Position and Orientation of the object. You will come across this in the future if you learn more complex scripting. 

- Instance: An object in a game, any of them. They can be a state of existing or non-existing in the game or nil. You can make a new object in a game through "".new(""[Insert name of an object here]"")""

- Enum: This is rarely used, but I believe they are properties that are used in properties like ""Materials"" and ""Camera Type"". 

- Table: A list of things, they are represented by being surrounded by curly braces. Ex: {Eggs, Bacon, stuff}. Using the :GetChildren() Function allows you to access the list of the objects under the lower hierarchy of the object. Tables are useful for containing information in categories. I mean, I am massively generalizing the usefulness of tables, but that's basically it.


Those are the terms I think you need to understand. If you are intimidated by this, no worries, that tends to be what happens you are introduced to this the first time. The problem is that in scripting you need to build up a habit of remembering useful functions, values, and events to make a game efficiently.",1514765047

"linux_gaming","t5_2r2u0","&gt; Is there a way for me to use the games already installed on the windows side?

If the game files are placed in the correct location, or your Steam library location is pointed to the location with the game files, then when you attempt to install the game it should do a file check and then download anything additional that it needs.  If you think this might allow sharing a Linux and Windows Steam library, I wouldn't try it, because the file check only happens once, and if any files that the Linux or Windows version needs get overwritten, the game will be broken for the other platform.

It's really best to simply play as many games as you can play on Linux, and only support Linux gaming going forward while finishing up any games that have no Linux version in Windows, or in Linux via WINE.  Or you can even wait if you wanted, resting assured that you'll be able to play the games natively if they get released, or eventually in WINE once they are compatible.  Either way, No Tux No Bux is the best thing you can do for Linux gaming to send the message that if devs don't support us and our platform, we won't support them.",1514765047

Hell, my father missed the Vietnam war because he was completing a voluntary stint in the navy and starting college when we entered the war.  He was also extremely anti-war to the extent that he dropped out of college two months before graduating with a physics degree when it became clear that all they were ever going to want him to do with it back then was build a bigger better bomb and he wasn't having any part of it.

If you can't do it, you really should get someone to write the script for it.  It really is the type of thing great movies have been made out of and the younger generations don't realize how much of this crap has happened in the history of the world...and is still happening today.

That was me this summer...emotionally I was ready to commit to a guy after being single for 3 years but given how crazy my summer was, anything more (a new guy, a new volunteer position etc) than what i already had going on, wouldn't have worked out. 

Sometimes it also takes a lot of average-bad matches for one to figure out what they like in someone, or for them to realize how amazing someone is. There's no right or wrong way of going at it, you can either take a break from dating or just continue through and hope for the best because, in all seriousness, the best ones happen when you least expect it.

My legs are naturally strong and my quads are like crazy defined, however my natural fat storage places are in my neck and my stomach which is unfortunate. I’m mainly concerned about not wanting to have to cut because I don’t want to go below what I have now, so I definitely won’t end up there again. I’ve noticed when I’m hungry now, after all that is over, the side effects are a lot stronger. On thanksgiving I had to wait about 2 hours later than I normally have dinner and I honestly thought I was going to die, I was so hungry and it hurt just to be sitting on a chair.

So far, when test firing, zeroing in my red dot, and generally goofing around with it in my free time it is excellent. The trigger pull is short, the response is fast. The grip can be a little uncomfortable without gloves, due to its low cut smg stock, it’s near impossible to get good a cheek weld and not kill your neck, but the G5 has the same deal with that from what I can tell, so just get a risen sight like a T1 style red dot(what I bought). A foregrip is recommended, since the very smooth mlok rail doesn’t allow for the best of grips. I personally recommend a PTS fortis shift grip(full size, not the short one) the 3-round burst is really nice too. I would list the low cap mags as a con if your other option wasn’t a gbb, but even they’ve got twice the ammo in them as a g5 mag will.

"marxism_101","t5_3avj0","I'll answer your first question.

Marxism has a schism between the 'falling rate of profit' school &amp; the 'underconsumption' school. The former focus on the problem of producing surplus value (essentially profit), &amp; the latter a problem realising surplus value.
The falling rate of profit school mistakenly view the problem as an explanation for the business cycle, rather than a longer term tendency. The underconsumptionists wrongly see the solution in printing money.
Marx wasn't very clear in any of his works explaining the nature of capitalism's business cycle. Both schools can find quotes to support their view. It is only with a clear understanding of the difference between the essence of labor values based upon 'socially necessary' labor time &amp; the form of exchange-value (prices), that it is possible to understand that leverage from the credit system can enable 'overproduction', i.e. aggregate prices to exceed aggregate values. The market is artificially inflated to temporarily keep up with production. Only when the leverage starts to result in defaults do we get the 'Minsky Moment', credit crunch, financial crisis &amp; recession. Printing money, as in QE, can indeed fool the markets &amp; reflate the debt bubble. It can 'extend &amp; pretend' only by deferring the current crisis into an even bigger future crisis.
The central banks will struggle to get away with it again. Maybe even the $ regime will not survive next time.

I have a two step guide for successfully getting your daughters into a stable marriage.

1. Be rich. 

2. Don't be poor.

Now, if it is just a matter of being rich, then how could poor people maintain marriages in the before times before the feminism boom boom? For that matter, what does being rich have to do with staying married?

Put your kids in an environment where marriage is not only expected, it is the NORM, and deviations from that are both SHAMED and meet with REAL CONSEQUENCE, and you will be amazed how much behavior can improve.

Proles are surrounded by broken families and the idiot boxes paint whoring around as glamorous and desirable. Prostitutes are winners!

Bougiefags are surrounded by intact marriages and the idiot box is set aside in favor of family time, gay ass activities, and school stuff. The-guys-who-went-to-a-prestigious-four-year-university-networked-achieved-status-jobs-and-settled-into-quiet-suburbia are winners!

But the former could become more similar to the latter if **both men and women** agreed to uphold certain standards again.

&gt;Seeing a couple friends with otherwise perfect daughters and strong households starting to run head first into the new culture. It is.... not going well.

You have to keep them inside the culture for it to work. Staying Amish forever? Success. Leaving Amishland? They'll start to slut it up in Normieville. The reason Murray calls UMCland a bubble is because inside UMCland, you may never really meet a poor person. This isolates your UMC spawn from the sins of the world. If you could raise someone religious, *and make sure they stay within that church culture and those social circles*, then a religious upbringing would work.

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R] LOCATION - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.  Make sure you're not using W when you mean to use F, or A when you mean to use R.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/r4r, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/r4r/submit?sidebar&amp;title=AGE [R4R] LOCATION - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fr4r).

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

I was with two buddies, we were setting fence posts for a cattle pasture, we were taking a break and one dude says ""hey look at that"" he was looking up in the sky due west. We all looked up to see a huge triangle that was glowing pure white light like a fluorescent tube light.
This thing was just sort of drifting along through the puffy white clouds. At the time I lived in western Michigan between Grand Rapids and Grand Haven. This thing came from over Lake Michigan and it was basically following the Grand River east very slowly like 10-20 miles an hour in and out of the clouds when it came out of a cloud or went through a cloud you could see wisps of cloud trailing after it as it went through.
We were all completely speechless, we watched it for around 15-20 minutes, it came within maybe 1/2 mile from us and it was 1-2000 feet up, it was totally featureless, the corners of the triangle were rounded.
Out in the sticks you kind of measure stuff by miles, not blocks. From where I lived to my buddies house which was the only other house on the road at the time was a mile, afterward, we all estimated it was close to a mile from corner to corner. When it was closest to us you had to move your whole head to see from corner to corner you couldn't just move your eyes and take it all in.
When it got about halfway to the eastern horizon it stopped completely for a minute or two and then turned into a white streak straight up to gone as fast as you could blink.
I had and have no idea what it was or where it came from, it was definitely an unidentified flying object.

"santacruz","t5_2qonf","I live in East Morrissey now and would recommend this neighborhood for u/TraumaICURN. 

Houses for rent in this well-kept and super convenient part of town run about $3k for a 2-bed 1 bath. Some properties have more than one home on a lot, so you might find a landlord who is on-site. The people here are a mix of long-term residents/retirees, and young families with high wage-earners (many who commute over the hill). 

I've been in this house for 5+ years and still haven't been burgled. Cased, I'm sure, but definitely not robbed. We have security cameras and fencing, among other less-obvious safety features. 

I know SC used to be super nice and crime has gone up in the past decades. However, I've lived in many cities, including the better parts of LA and silicon valley, and frankly the crime and drugs are not any better there either, these days.

Property crime is still present in East Morrissey, but if you're aware of your surroundings and don't leave your doors/windows/cars unlocked or your valuables visible (some people don't even have curtains, wtf?), you're less of a target. Security cameras are effective too. 

You can't treat living in Santa Cruz like this is the past. You have to be smart and do what people in big cities do to make yourself less of a target for crime.",1514765063

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","I think your misunderstanding here is that the combat level calculation is unclear to you. It would be worthwhile to check out the wiki and look over the combat level equation. There are also combat calculators available which allow you to input values for each combat skill and observe the effective combat level.

For your main question “why do range pures train mage” the answer is that raising your magic level does not necessarily raise your combat level. This of course depends on the combat level equation.

The combat level equation in a simplified way works kind of like this:

-Defence/Hitpoint/Prayer levels always raise combat level no matter what
-Attack/Strength level combined raises combat level only when Range or Magic is low enough
-Range level raises combat level only when Attack/Strength or Magic level is low enough
-Magic level raises combat level only when Attack/Strength or Range level is low enough

Because Magic only raises combat level when Range is low enough, having a very high Range level can potentially prevent combat level increase. The way this actually works is that combat level is calculated based on which of the two skills are higher. There is no difference in the combat level of a player with 99 range and 1 mage compared to a player with 99 range and 99 mage. This is how the combat calculation works.

It’s also true that a player with 99 range or mage can gain up to ~135 or so combined Attack/Strength levels without increasing their combat level. You can see this if you check out the combat level equation and start to understand how it works.

This is also why niche accounts like 10hp exist. Since Defense/Hitpoints always raises combat level, keeping Hitpoints low always reduces combat level. This is of course how 1 def works.

TL;DR go study the combat level equation and you’ll answer your own question",1514765064

&gt; We've already got a problem with marginal college students not paying back their student loans.

Its the system functioning exactly how you want it to. Its not going to work out for everyone, arguing that people who try and fail should be punished beyond not trying at all is retarded.

The median wage is $15 an hour, people are desperate to dig themselves out of that, even if it means working for a loss to get the experience that gets them a good job. This phenomena is called leverage, you might want to familiarize yourself with it.

Employers keep on demanding that their hires have these skills, and they do objectively need them. Maybe if they stopped getting the shit advice to just bend over and take whatever live gives them, then would form a competent adult response and negotiate for a better wage; or hire someone with that skillset to do that for them (recruiters/unions).

&gt; Free college is a nightmare.

There was a time when people didn't have to sell themselves into slavery to get a higher education, the children of the great depression built the modern world out of sand.

&gt; So the idea of free college is to draw even more students into a system that isn't a money maker for them

Who said it was free college for everyone? There are still only so many seats and competing for them, and there is still the concept of flunking out.

&gt; You think we're living in free markets now? Ummm, no. Free markets don't need rigorous sets of laws, nor social spending. The two industries most impacted by social spending (higher education, health care) are the most screwed up and distorted markets we have.

Well then, lets take a tour around the places that don't have all of this democracy and resultant social spending, they must be very productive:

Get there however you like, if you are expected to bring along a very large sum of capital to start a business, then the option remains in the hands of very few. Most people are not ""free"" to do so. You get much less competition.

&gt; I'm not feeling the love. The corporate fat cat who used the regulator to reduce competition is feeling the love.

That a job can be done poorly is not an argument in favor of not doing the job. My experience with regulators is that I get to show off how well I am doing my job.

"Watches","t5_2qls5","I was the owner of 2 other Seiko Turtle’s when my wife purchased this for my birthday.  She knew I really wanted the PADI but simply could not bring myself to buy it.

I am a huge fan of history, which is what ultimately brought me to my passion for watches.  The PADI itself is a re-issue by Seiko so I would argue it doesn’t come with much inherent  history as some of my other Seiko pieces do....but it was a gift given to me with love.  As we were laying in bed this morning being lazy, I noticed her rubbing the watch with her thumb while holding my hand and it occurred to me that we were writing the history of this watch.  And one day when I pass it along it will have the history of my wife and I just hanging out in bed together, being relatively young and in tact on this last day of 2017.

It’s not my nicest watch....but it’s my favorite today.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","&gt; Reasoning is anything that derives a conclusion through a mental process. Logic is a form of reasoning and it is in fact non-empirical. Empiricism is a different form of reasoning, separate from logic.

You're talking out your ass, man.  What you're describing is not reasoning, it's just emotional response.  ""Deriving a conclusion"" has a specific meaning that involves logical steps proceeding from premises to conclusions.  You're just trying to use the semantics of language to make emotion appear to be a valid replacement for logic, which I'm guessing is because you don't like religion's retreat from the world of science.

&gt;Spiritual reasoning starts from experiences and our existing understanding, it evaluates their content and meaning with reference to the forces of love, justice, good, evil, and integrity that guide the spirit in the world, and it develops conclusions that maximize explanatory power with reference to those forces.

Explanatory power is predictive power.  They're one and the same.  It's not just ""emotional power of the explanation.""  The process you're describing has no explanatory power, it has emotional significance, and that's an important but entirely different thing.

&gt;Your comments indicate plainly that you don't understand the value in these ways of understanding the world.

Because you've not explained any of them.  I don't even know what you're talking about, how am I supposed to tell you whether or not I understand their value?  

&gt;You need to explore them in your own life in situations that matter to you, though, my abstract explanations are going to be of little or no help.

How can I go looking for something that you've not defined?  How do I know when I've found it?  Oh, right, this is the same bullshit that too many religious people run with about ""only being able to find God if you have faith in him.""  It's a conundrum.  I have to explore them in order to understand them but I can't do so until I have some understanding of what to explore.  

&gt;my abstract explanations are going to be of little or no help. Probably even doing harm since it's part of what you see as a debate about religion.

Why don't you actually try and give them?  I've been asking about it for several comments now.  Or are you just being disingenuous?",1514765066

"me_irl","t5_2vegg","Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one. ",1514765071

D. Rain has the 50% all mitigation provoke just like WKN and you can build him for the typical health strat as well, forgoing the counters. iNichol would make him an AoE tank for any AoE physicals and the extra mitigation so that’s nice. GL Sakura can get her dual cast on from turn 1 and because we have WWF who has an AMAZING Ritual enhancement you won’t run in MP problems, for healing that same WWF would have the Sheratan staff on for the SPR doublehand passive and the dual cast white that the staff provides so healing is fine as well. Jake can be a sacrifice for D. Rain if needed thanks to his targeted cover, odds are your Jake is going to be full health almost all the time so if D.Rain is too low to soak the next big hit or something you have his Provoke up so things target him, tell Jake to cover him, and watch as all the attacks are focused on a double wall. Just pick jake up when you’re done. BC Lid does BC Lid things.

Edit; I guess on the flip side, Turn 1 for Christmas WKN has his provoke and mitigation active, Christine gives frost shards to WKN who should be using his tanks mage build, Kryla imperils ice and then turn 2 WKN and Christine single target chain things to death. It doesn’t have the sustain that Halloween has but with imperil ice chain odds are you won’t need that MP because the fight is over quickly.

Of those, arachne and cama aren't relevant and Thor, Thanatos, and rat are basically the same character. I did not mention Dajir and 
Fenrir because she does pretty well against them. 

Lash does a lot of damage while being fairly easy to land, her stun gives her more power, and her leap has a heal. Combined with being able to play a lot more aggressively off her passive, she can easily 1v1 most other junglers at 2-3 thanks to her kit. The only junglers out poking early are Thor and Thanatos thanks to their hammer and scythe being a bit easier to hit raw and do more damage most of the time. her fall off comes from her ult really only being good to save you, which is a lot more powerful when that extra time can kill 2 more people and full heal you twice. compared to a thor ult or or a hun batz ult, it just really falls short at level 5.",1514765074

However, if you look at the IBJJF rules:

&gt; while keeping the foot of the leg at risk stuck between
his hip and armpit

You need to control the foot for it to be considered reaping though. The position can occur naturally in several different ways and it's fine as long as you don't wrap up the ankle. That's only the case if you're both down though, because next part clarifies:

&gt; It is not necessary for one of the athletes to hold the foot
of his opponent in order for the foot to be considered
caught or stuck.

&gt; For purposes of this rule, when one athlete is standing and
bearing their weight on foot of the same leg as the knee
in danger, the foot will be considered caught or stuck.

So you can reap as long as A: they aren't standing on that foot and B: you don't control the foot of the leg you're reaping.

Took it in for a set-up to a legendary guitar shop here (they shaved the neck of Jimmy Pages Les Paul when he was here, set up and repaired Joe Walsh's guitars, etc etc etc). They had never seen one and were shocked at the quality. They said it was easily worth 2-3k at least. And, I couldn't agree more. The quality of the workmanship is amazing. 

Years ago I lived in NYC and my teachers played either D'Angelico's or D'Aquisto's (an apprentice of D'Angelico), and they were incredibly instruments. When I heard the line was being revived I had very very low expectations. Figured they'd slap the name on and build a cheap replica. Nothing cheap about them at all. I've only played 3, but each of them was incredibly well made and sounded outstanding. I have a Gibson Midtown Custom and a Prestige (small builder in Vancouver) and they are BOTH fine 335 type models, but neither competes with the D'Angelico--although the Prestige gets pretty damn close.

An awkward computer programmer gets almost no satisfaction or fulfillment from his real life, and being a genius, he creates a realistic and deeply satisfying game in which he can live out his dreams, completely removed from the real world. The bullies, groups, and coworkers who have tortured, ridiculed, and patronized the awkward programmer are strangely resentful of his removal from their ideologies and dogma, and rather than allowing him to enjoy his alternate life in peace, they insist on trying to shame him and force him to submit to their narrow and flawed view of the ""real world"". 

Of course, the bullies insist that the programmer, by happily eliminating the bullies' power over him, is a racist, misogynist bigot who is deserving of their vitriol. As the audience, we will struggle to understand why these people hate him too much to simply leave him alone, and why they are so desperate to invoke their ""real world"" power over him, when it appears he is not at all responsible for anybody else's problems.

Second, how long is your hair? This reply will be more accurate for you if your hair is longer, (past your ears) but if it's short, don't worry too much about avoiding your scalp with conditioner. 


What caused the change in your hair type? Is it chemically treated, hormonal, or did you just cut it off and it was wavy when it grew back in? 

I also have psoriasis on my scalp, (which YES it is annoying as fuck) and thick, wavy, somewhat dry hair. Conditioning doesn't hurt the psoriasis because the conditioner doesn't go on your scalp, you should start applying on the ends and work your way up until you're within an inch of your scalp. As for the t-gel, try and keep that *only* on your scalp when you apply it.

But I do downvote, although at least in my case, it's in the following circumstances:

- When the prompt is clearly soliciting more content than they provide the reader - if you wax enthusiastic about wanting a handsome, literate roleplayer for detailed shenanigans but provide nothing more than cookie-cutter description of your (alleged) physical appearance, Mr. Blue Arrow gets a visit. It does seem a bit more common for F4X prompts to do this, but not entirely.
- Being an asshole in one's out-of-character talk in a prompt. In-character is fine; some people like cocky assholes. But if someone comes off as rude or entitled... Yup, another visit. 
- Frequent reposting of near-identical content - if someone posts the same damn thing every day, with  just enough variation to avoid the mods, it still doesn't mean that person's really contributing to the sub. This one's an equal-opportunity offense, in my past observation.
- Stuff I consider inherently just... wrong. This one is a *high, high,* ***high*** bar to clear. This stuff is fantasy, I get it - if you want to get all non-con on your fantasy family members, or have every orifice stuffed by a pack of wild dogs, or pull some *Black Mirror*-type sci-fi shit, that's great! Live and let live. But if you're soliciting someone to play out your *real life*, mentally disabled neighbor for a vicious rape fantasy (which I've actually seen)? Yeah, that's a no. That's a *hard* no, and you're getting a downvote.  
- If it's stolen from someone else, I'll smack that button before reporting, just out of a sense of righteous justice.
- If it's lazily written. Not poorly written - we have a substantial user base that may not have English as their first language, and varying levels of skill, and they deserve to have fun just like everyone else. But if someone's just phoning it in, and clearly trading on demographic appeal, or writing just enough with ""pics in post history?"" Also a downvote.

That's pretty much the bulk of my downvotes, honestly- if I just dislike a prompt/it's another M4F/it seems weird, I'm more likely to upvote it. I read pretty much everything that catches my eye regardless of gender tag, honestly, and try to spread some love where I can.

They still bring men up and ask me if I hate my own brother because I must hate all men. 

They think I've been brainwashed by my friends who support me.

**Author**:  _KingTrog_ 

 **Content**:  

 &gt;First of all: I can't really ask a accountant for advise in my town cause most of us out here don't even know what credit cards are let alone crypto money, already tried so I'm gonna ask you smart motherfuckers. 

&gt;Listen here man, I'm freaking the hell out. I'm reading all of this shit about crypto to crypto taxes and I'm about to go crazy. Is there any software to help keep up with the constant fluctuation of different cryptos? I mean, the price of cryptos change sometimes every minute or second, how does one keep track of that every second to make sure you report the right amount of taxes? 

&gt;Look here, I know how to pay taxes on what I make in dollars (even though I don't agree with it but that's a whole different argument) but God damn, crypto to crypto prices change faster then my aunt Jenny for Sunday morning service!  I could go to jail for making a  mistake? I probably can't ask for help in my town , it's a small, southern town with like a thousand people. Most of us out here don't even know what credit cards are let alone crypto money God dammit so good luck finding an accountant for this. 

&gt;I'm just freaking out, man. Thank you for anyone who can answer.  I wish I could just pay the mathafuckas what I owe in dollar amount, chicken shit chicken shit",1514765083

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My grandparents were married over 50 years.  When she died 10 years ago (he was 87 at the time), people thought he would quietly follow, as many older folks do.  He didn't. She had made him promise he would do his best to be happy and live life to its fullest, and he did. He started exercising again, he remodeled his house, he even got a new girlfriend.  They're still a couple today, and he's still happy and living vigorously at 97. 

But his house is still full of pictures of my grandmother. He still goes to her grave at least once a month. We still celebrate her birthday as a family. She is still the love of his life, and nothing he does now will ever change or erase that.  All those years happened, and they carry weight and significance. They are not diminished or tarnished by his actions today, especially since he still holds a great reverence for them.  We all know that she never would have wanted him to spend the rest of his days pining and missing what was, and none of us would have ever wished such a sad and lonely fate for him either.  He was lucky to have had a great true love in his time. If he had been a younger man when she passed, there might have been room for a second.  Society loves the idea that people have ""one true love,"" but I'm not the only one who has never thought that was true.  Some people have none, some have multiple, and all of that is ok.  What comes after does not diminish what came before. 

I hope you understand why I would relate his story.  You have so much life left to live, and what you do now does not erase or lessen your past. You do not disrespect her memory by creating new ones and striving for happiness in the life that you must now lead.  But I also understand your feelings.  If you imagine the situation were reversed and you were able to look down on your wife from beyond, surely you would not want her to be alone for the rest of her days?  Moving forward does not mean forgetting. She will be with you always, regardless of the choices you make. Cherish your memories and your stories, but do not allow them to bind you. Life only moves in one direction. 

All that said, I wish you happiness and comfort, however you decide to proceed. You deserve it. ",1514765086

"UnresolvedMysteries","t5_2wvvc","&gt;On April 28, 2017, Twitch user Paul Denino (pseudonym ""Ice Poseidon"") was live streaming before boarding an American Airlines flight. After the plane had landed, law enforcement showed up on the tarmac and removed Denino and one other person from the plane. An anonymous caller claimed that Denino had a bomb when he did not. Days later, Ice's swatter calls Ice on his hotel room and ask US per month or he will not stop swatting him The caller is still unidentified.

It's common knowledge by those that where in the community at the time that [Asik from raidforums] (https://raidforums.com/User-Asik) did and continues to do this. It's not a mystery at all and we've been had his information. We know all about how hes a greasy polish fuck and about how his family stays in Germany. We even got IP logs his VPNs and FBI knows about him and raid-forums as well but at the end of the day its outside jurisdiction for them and until he gets someone killed with his swatting absolute nothing will happen. You can't even shut down their sites because its locked behind layer and layer of political red tape and a grand cayman island registrant.

Twitter only recently banned his twitter @whatps2 when he tried to SELL his twitter account through twitter instead of actually banning it for claiming swattings despite his entire feed of him claiming swats and threatening swats.

It doesn't help that Ice's dumbass releases videos like [This] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZHQoRfFTmM) of the swatting that is basically just porn for the perpetration. 

Final [video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6_OQzIt6Os) I'll put up about this attention whore. Really speaks volumes to how much time these kids will waste into trying to ruin other people's lives.",1514765090

Simplest approach would be to grab an overflow box like an eshopps eclipse.  Its a prebuilt kit and makes things easier.  The whole concept of an overflow and return pump is that the flow of the overflow is always going to be the same speed as the return pump assuming you size it correctly.  more water you put into the tank the more water overflows into the box and down to the sump.

I live in a prison glut, on the northern border. Not only are my neighbors racist and loud about it, they come here from every redneck corner of the country.

Ask your management during the interview if you can be the back-up or start doing some training here and there if they don't think you're the best candidate. Most stores tend to have back-ups that receive de facto training whenever the workload is too high or the SWAT takes a vacation. These people tend to be the ones who get the position when it becomes available. Also, no matter what happens make sure you subscribe to the SWATbook on the Hub. It's such a good resource of info and 9/10 times if I have an issue they can help solve it, or have already solved it before it becomes an issue.

"pelotoncycle","t5_39us7","The deal breaker for me is the lifetime membership if you want the bike to function.
 I’m considering the Keiser M3 with the 3 year warranty at no extra cost and the Peleton app membership on iPad that I can cancel at any time and still use the bike with the stats that show up on its computer. I was about to finance the Peleton after trying it in Santa Monica but the rep told me you cant pause the membership while it is financed. People get injured, breed, go on vacation and this is nonsense. 
The weight to torque ration algorithm that is missing from their leaderboard program is also a deal breaker. At 105 lbs I never show up at Equinox, or Flywheel’s leaderboard although I match the torque and cadence. Men and large women make it and some of the men are barely sweating. How this oversight is not brought into the Peleton conversation is beyond me. I read on Reddit that there was an update to the calories burned calculation but nothing yet on leveling out the playing field for petit body types or the entire community. 
 The way youre sitting on your bike upright is also not ideal for me. I like to get the most output from my gluteus and on my road bike can achieve that. When I tried it in store the seat is adjustable and as you mentioned the handle bars only go up and down so that is IMO the third downfall. Cheaper at home spin bikes that cost 400 dollars on amazon have this. 

Finally, the calibration of the Peleton bikes are not exact from bike to bike as noted on reddit by a user that has two bikes. On one he manages to perform at 30% higher on the leaderboard on average. He has reached out to Peleton with no resolution. Just a general corporate response. As it turns out positive reinforcement through false results putting home users on par with Tour de France cyclists in statistics sells more bikes than calling people with miraculous stats and offering to adjust their bikes gratis. That would also cost the company money. Turns out the Peleton is a figment of the group think imagination. I don’t take issue with that but I wont be buying into it either. ",1514765093

"2007scape","t5_2wbww","The account recovery process is ridiculous. 

I see one of the biggest issues with it is that they don't give you the tools or ability to secure your account. It's nearly as if anyone getting hacked is their own fault or that you should've had authenticator/not been phished or not been a bit open with your private information (DOXX info).

The lack of delay is atrocious and completely undermines their system to the point that it barely protects against simple keyloggers. 

If Jagex started looking at accounts in a dollar value way they'd make some changes. Instead of looking at a hack for 2b as that they should consider it somebody stealing $2000 that they've allowed, or losing 100s of hours for nothing. That's just embarrassing. 

Their mentality is fucked, their support is a joke (unhelpful, don't investigate anything and just reply in a few hours with an ill-fitting copy-paste to get the 'reply time' stats down), they blame victims when things go wrong and they're so slow to move on any changes that a large portion of the player base have a negative story about that time they got hacked and had to either eat a dick or quit the game.

IMO being hacked is one of the most damaging things that can happen to a players loyalty. If a player doesn't feel safe on their account, what incentive is there to invest more if it's possible that they'll just be hacked again? I'm sure that kills retention rates.

Jagex, improve your systems, retain more players, reduce the amount of CS contact dealing with shit like this and step up to your responsibility as a company to take care of your players.

Add delay to recovery/auth and **make it so that people can change log-ins from usernames too**.

Sounds like you have every reason to quit. I wouldn't have quit if everything was going peachy. And I'm a *massive* drug addict. My idea of fun was drug synthesis. Bought dope, sold dope, etc. It was my identity and I couldn't imagine a life without using.

I'm not too far sober, so I can't preach about 'how great it is' because it's not still. It's a lot of fucking work and you have to understand that it's going to get worse before it gets better. You're gonna have to face the shithole you've dug yourself into without the chemical crutch anymore.

But hey, we're in a similar situation. My relationships were strained, I was making good money yet always broke, arrested, car seized, etc. etc.

Two months in and I've made some friends, started spending my free time productively, got my felony dropped, have a job interview for a good company, and I'm making plans to accomplish the goals I've aimed for. Still lost my car. Bored as fuck a lot of the time. Dealing with stress I haven't had to worry about for years thanks to dope. But it's just gonna take time.

The fact that you're attractive, intelligent, and have a support system of family works in your favor. Imagine not having those things going into this. A lot of people have to do just that.

"artc","t5_3h0dy","Did a modified Michigan workout I'm terming The Muchogan.

Still keeping things a bit conservative in terms of workouts post marathon. It's been three weeks since the race at this point but I'd rather be overly cautious right now as opposed to jumping back in too fast and getting injured. Was really busy Friday/Saturday and didn't manage to get in any miles or really much activity at all and hadn't been eating/hydrating nearly enough. So I was feeling a bit so-so, my legs were fresh but body a bit lethargic.

Wanted to keep the tempo repeats as is but ease off on the pace a bit for the faster repeats and add in some extra volume instead.  Also a note the track I do workouts at blocks lanes 1-4 so I run in lane 5, laps are roughly 430m. And the roads around the track are hilly and have tons of stop lights, so I just did everything on the track. Plan was the following:

4x: 

* 1720m (4 laps) @ T - goal 6:12 (3:36/km - 5:48/mi) 
* 200m rest
* 1720m (4 laps) @ 5k-10k pace - goal 5:45-6:00 (3:20-3:29/km - 5:22-5:36/mi)
* 400m rest

I was really confident on being able to hit that pace on the T reps. Not so much on the faster ones, didn't know if I'd be able to get up to 5k pace (3:20/km-ish) at all so I figured as long as I was faster than 10k pace I'd be pretty happy.

The Muchogan
---

Warmup: went for a long warmup to get some mileage in. About 10k of easy running on the roads, then 1720 around the track at marathon pace and two strides. About 12k total.

Set 1: Go out way too quick on the first tempo rep. Ease off after the first lap. Hit the rep in 6:11, right on pace. Pace feels comfortable, not easy but the effort feels about right. Quick 200m jog and I go in on the faster rep. I'm hitting it at about 5k effort but as expected I can't quite hit the right pace. Finish in 5:49. 400m jog, recovered pretty well ready to hit it again. Seems like I can do three more sets maybe.

Set 2: The tempo rep feels much easier stepping down from a faster rep, almost like marathon effort. Cruise through in 6:12 on the money and recover well on the 200 jog. The faster rep feels tougher this time but not too bad, 5:52. Half way done.

Set 3: Tempo rep feels slightly tougher but still not too bad, 6:12 on the money again. The faster rep is brutal. A very light wind is blowing on the track now, shouldn't be enough to slow me down but it kicks my butt. I struggle to keep my laps under 1:30. Finish in 5:57, just a bit quicker than 10k pace. Only one more set...

Set 4: Tempo rep feels hard for the first time.  At this point I'm at about 24km on the day, usually that wouldn't be too big of a deal but without eating enough for the past two days I'm feeling a bit drained. Still manage to hit it in 6:12. I was thinking that I could try to hit the last fast rep at 5k pace but after about 200m it's clear I can't hold that pace. Focus on the effort and just try to survive for the next 100m. Kick hard on the last lap. Manage a 5:49. 

Cooldown: about 4km to hit 32k on the day.

Overall a pretty successful workout. Felt really strong on the tempo reps even when I started to build up a lot of fatigue. Averaged about 8k race pace on the faster reps which I think is pretty good given the volume. One last hurrah to finish up the year. Looking forward to a fast and fit and healthy 2018!",1514765095

Images, screenshots, or gifs uploaded through the Reddit app or the reddit website are not allowed; as such, your post has been removed.  We only allow images as part of a discussion post, or if hosted on a portfolio site; gameplay gifs must be hosted on another website and that link shared to reddit.

## How do I submit images or screenshots?

You may submit your post as a [discussion (self) post](/r/Overwatch/submit?selftext=true) with some context - more than just a single line of text - speaking about the image. If you're submitting fanart, you may link directly to a DeviantArt page, ArtStation portfolio, blog, etc.  

Imgur posts are automatically removed, even if its a GIFV, as we're not able to detect which type it is.

## How do I submit a gameplay highlight?

You may submit your gameplay highlight by uploading it to a GIF/video sharing website and submitting the link to /r/Overwatch. We do not support uploading gameplay highlights directly through the Reddit app/website at this time.

If your sister acts more spoiled or entitled, or just generally isn't as friendly with him as you, I wouldn't blame him.

Any time your mother accuses you of acting like your father or not caring, spin it right back around on her. ""I wish you would admit sister's being unreasonable. I haven't done anything wrong, and you're encouraging her act out and be entitled. I'm asking you to step in and put a stop to it.

When you sister accuses you of being unfair: ""that's between you and uncle, leave me out of it."" Grey rock the hell out of her.

* A person pirates the game who would not have paid to play this game. However, this person advertises this game in some fashion, whether they post a Let's Play or tells his friends what a great game it is. Those people who are exposed to the advertisement end up purchasing the game. Potential sales gained.

These examples attempt to demonstrate that there are various outcomes that would not exist without piracy. I propose that the mathematical example you provide is too simplistic to arrive at your conclusion that modding/piracy = lost sales.

As I mentioned in my other comment, there are fairly large sample studies done. Check out https://cdn.netzpolitik.org/wp-upload/2017/09/displacement_study.pdf for why price (where piracy = free) doesn't explain sales declines in the EU.",1514765099

"MakeupRehab","t5_32g1x","I am kicking off January and February with a buying pause. After that, I am shifting into a flexible low buy - basically, I have planned a specific seasonal purchase for around April, and I’ll probably do the same for around September or October. In between I am allowed replacements and only very well considered, budget conscious buying. Maybe something for my birthday in June but only is it’s carefully considered. My goal is to NOT renew VIB, much less Rouge and to keep total new purchase spending under $400 across all sources since that comes out to $100 quarterly which I don’t think is too bad for a hobby but is hopefully more than I’ll need. If I can spend less and still enjoy trying a new thing or two just a couple times a year, great! I don’t care if I keep platinum at Ulta because my local drugstores are really awful so I order shampoo, cotton pads, and all sorts of mundane replacements from there and at least they have better rewards. I don’t think I’ll legitimately need enough stuff to hit it though.

I am making one exception to my start of year no-buying, which is if I find I need to pick up an inexpensive lip liner or two (must be under $10) because I don’t have any and I’m starting to wear my darker lipsticks a lot more. However, I have a clear jumbo liner that I’m going to try to get by with first. Basically if I am looking like a mess without liner I am allowed to remedy the problem but only if I have to.

*edited to add: ok, the clear liner doesn't solve the problem I see with my darker colors where the color gets a little like, fuzzy?? on my top lip line, so I decided to do my ""exception"" asap so it can't become a ""buy other stuff too"" excuse later and picked up some very inexpensive liners in the offending colors. I've never been into liners because i didn't see the need but suddenly I have these little lines happening and I really am excited to be branching away from the ""nude pink all the time"" train I've been on for years. I decided that the spend including still counts for my annual total even though this was my ""exception,"" because they're still a new item. This is also accomplishing another goal I have: I love high end stuff because part of the appeal of doing my makeup is feeling luxurious and fancy.  HOWEVER. I have NO BUSINESS doing things like dropping $20 a pop on lip liners and it's time to find drugstore options for the items I will either not use often, or tend to go through quickly and need to replace.  Like, when my clear brow gel runs out I am NOT buying the high end replacement I was eyeing, I'm spending like $5 at the drugstore or ulta because there is NO NEED. 

I think I am also going to look at my Jan/Feb goal as a ""shopping"" pause instead of in terms of buying. Because going around looking for things to then decide I want is as big or bigger of an issue to me than actually buying them - I want to waste less time in addition to less money. I'm going to TRY to avoid browsing, swatch comparing, and all that. The end, for now :)",1514765100

Other places are smaller bubbles -- okay but not as safe: grocery store, for instance.  When I have to be out and about in public, I pretty much shut down and go on auto pilot.  When someone asks ""How are you?"" I have a standard response; I open my mouth and hear ""I'm well, thank you,"" no matter what.  I'm confident that I could be bleeding profusely and I'd still answer ""I'm well, thank you.""  If I am out and about and start to notice the people around me too much, I start to feel physically ill and will have to leave immediately to go to my car (safe bubble).

I don't think this is a good way to live.  Alcohol helps immensely if I have to be out of a comfort-bubble.  But I avoid those places if at all possible.  I like being alone (or home with family), so as long as I'm in one of the safe bubbles, I'm good.",1514765100

---

&gt; New people buying bitcoin is adoption. 
&gt; 
&gt; Thousands of new signups per day at exchanges is adoption. 
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt; The increased adoption has driven demand which increases price.
&gt; 
&gt; Here is what an adoption curve looks like.  Compare this to the bitcoin price curve.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","I understand the distances involved, the electric infrastructure issues, and I understand the increased ISR of lithium ion batteries in cold temperatures, and the range and charging speed issues caused by it.

I do not think we’re as far off as you think, though.  Tesla’s next generation is making a large leap in range, and even the new leaf has a 140 mile range.  In cold weather for the leaf, this is reduced by a substantial margin, but it’s only brought down to ~100 miles from reports I’ve read (I’m interested in a leaf and winters are pretty harsh where I live).

Now, clearly this is not enough for rural Canada in the winter, but it’s getting there.  Judging by what I’ve read about reported winter battery performance in current model Teslas, next gen will most likely get over 200 miles in very cold conditions.  That’s really starting to close the gap for a lot of people, as long as you can provide enough power to charge as fast as you discharge.

Level 1 charging (120v 10A, standard wall plug) is achievable at very low temperature, and if you plugged in everywhere you went, you can moderately increase your range (depending how long you park and charge for) and keep the batteries warm(er) due to the charging process, too.  That infrastructure needs to be there for that to happen, but it’s a lot cheaper than level 2 charging to implement.

I understand this may be difficult in rural areas, so obviously there’s gonna need to be better power distribution in more remote regions, which may not ever get substantially upgraded.  In the most remote regions, internal combustion is really the only option for the foreseeable future unless you can drive into town to charge in the same amount of time refueling takes, or somehow a generator at home is more efficient than just driving a vehicle with an internal combustion engine.

That's right, beginning with the table in the Upper Room.

&gt; I'll disagree mightily on this point, it's not a shortcoming by any means, think about another name we have for the Sacraments... the Mysteries. And traditionally since time immemorial the mysteries have been shrouded and cloaked until the moment of revelation to us. 

It's a HUGE shortcoming.  I'm not a fan of rood screens or the iconstasis in the least.  I deeply appreciate being able to actually view the process of the representation.  That's very important to me.  I don't want some Roman Centurion trying to block my view of Calvary.

Further, I suspect for at least the first couple of centuries AD, this sacred process was NOT obscured.

Like the other fellow already said, it's all about the confidence. If you already tried to think of like like an interview and that didn't work, have you tried thinking of it like flirting? If a girl said: ""You ain't got no car"" are you just gonna end the conversation then and there? It would be about the right time to hit back with something like: ""Why, you need a place to crash?""

So in this case, I'd twist the question on then. ""I understand that you're concerned about our company size, but let me ask you this... why is this a concern for you? Have you dealt with such matters in the past?"" and then take it from there... you can always just say that you keep your business lean and prefer to outsource work that's not part of the core-business.

Anti-communists.

&gt;unless the alternative is 100% government controlled housing...

If you think this is the goal of communism, you don't know a lick of the things we believe in.

&gt;IMO your landlord is the government

Strawman. You have a warped view of what we believe so you construct an argument based on what you think we believe and defeat that. That is textbook strawman.

&gt;DNC is explicitly a group engaged in political activity while reddit is not

Reddit is not. But lsc is.

&gt;people posting dissent...

Youre right, it doesn't. However, reread my first comment. Dissent doesnt get you banned. Making the charged claims like you did in this comment is what will make you banned. If i could flash comments and not just posts, I would flash ""socialism is when the government does stuff""right here.

&gt;Performance matters

I agree. Such as my first comment and the point i made one quote ago.

&gt;you can go into the DNC and talk about how abortion is wrong

Absolutely. But that isnt what i said now is it?

What OP did is what you did. Come on in and make charged claims without truly knowing what we believe and was in awe that he was banned. He deserved it. The current power structure has silenced communists since the time of Marx. Communist control act 1956 is a wonderful example. Don't be surprised when you try and say we believe in 100% gov control and get banned. Ask what we actually believe. A ban in my book is a nice thing and far less than what you deserve.

These Uniqlo jeans are excellent and my new favorite. Haven’t had them long enough to compare fully. They wear in well and give me better movement with the same great profile. Plus these seem like they were consistently produced with great materials than my experience with other brands and products. Wish I had bought more than two of them at this price and had been able to get some in Black. Bought and waiting on some Uniqlo Slim Selvedge in Black to test out before they’re gone too.

Edit - I like how detailed Uniqlo’s measurement guides are and partially what convinced me on their products. Anyone know other companies that do this well for those who like to shop online?

Edit2 - Bleeding is a real thing I noticed slightly. It’s likely too cold for it to get bad at the moment and I don’t have too many things I have to be careful of ruining or can hopefully be aware

Title: **Quick question about Medical Marijuana.**

Original Post: 

&gt; So in MGL Part 1, Title 15, Chapter 94G, Section 7 decriminalized the possession of one ounce or less of Marijuana and turns it into a civil offense. However in Mass Section Laws, Chapter 369 from the year of 2012 acts, it says a medical patient can have up to a 60 day supply. If I have a medical card and have, let's say, 2OZ for personal use. Can I legally have it seized and receive a fine for it, or am I covered under the act from 2012?

Then like I said you missed the point of the movie. Storylines like Rey's arc were beautifully executed and wonderful examples of great character development. Scenes like the Cave Scene where Rey asks to see her parents really sold the emotional weight of the movie. She sees only two shadows walking together... then merging together before fading into a reflection of her. The scene is meant to show that Rey's parents might be nobodies, but Rey is a somebody and that's all she should be concerned about. Not only is a powerful scene but it resonates with her storyline and adds more emotional weight to her scenes thereafter. Rey even tells Luke at the beginning ""I'm looking for someone to tell me my place in all this"" but the point of her story is that she's never gonna find someone to tell Rey where her place is because the only person who can tell Rey what's gonna happen to Rey is fucking Rey. Rey's arc in the story is largely conveyed to us visually or through action, almost never just exposition or monologuing. Her lifting the rocks at the end was Rey accepting her purpose to continue the Jedi, even though she thinks she does not come from an important lineage, instead she accepts that her place in the universe does not come from who she is but from what she does. And this is just one arc too... I can go on to explain why everyone is wrong about Rose too. ",1514765120

"FlashTV","t5_2y6bs","I don't get it. Iris being underwritten and essentially useless is a valid argument, especially since all she's been is a love interest since the Pilot. The reporting stuff was **very** underdone. She may as well not have been a reporter for how pitiful that subplot was presented.

Also, the writers are already taking screentime away from the other characters now that WestAllen is a couple. Iris is getting more screentime in Seasons 3 and 4 than she got in Seasons 1 and 2. It wouldn't be more screentime, it would just be the same amount of screentime, but with Iris doing something different than being team leader.

EDIT: And my dislike of Iris has a lot more to do with her personality, or lack thereof. She just isn't a character that draws me in. Giving her a storyline is one thing, but she still needs to resonate as a rootable character. Having her spout out reporter dialogue is no better than her trying to sound scientific and techie, if it all seems fake. These writers did an awful job making me believe Iris was even a viable reporter.",1514765123

"lawofattraction","t5_2rfq0","This is kinda how I see it. We manifest opportunities to meet and get to know people. Then again, I'm not sure how I feel about it or what my exact beliefs are, because I did manifest a specific person once, and that person had initially had a LOT of resistance to being with me. I worked for months and months to manifest him, doing everything from magic spells to intense visualizations. 

And it worked. I actually manifested him wanting me, finally. But once I got him, I REALLY got him. He was very attached and we were a solid couple, but not a healthy one. We clashed in many ways and he had drug problems and mood problems that made him toxic if not outright dangerous at times. I also had a ton of problems that were worsened or triggered by the stress of our relationship at the time, so neither of us were able to be good partners. 

Not only that, but when I finally dumped him years later, he really struggled to let go. Like, borderline stalking level of struggle. 

I always wondered if I did something wrong by trying SO hard to force the universe to make this person love me. Because it was never about manifesting happiness and compatibility with someone (what I should have been focusing on). I needed HIM. I was (unhealthily) OBSESSED with him. And at the time, I didn't even care if I was miserable with him. I wanted HIM at all costs. 

I have a hardcore crush on a few celebs now, but I try to be less forceful because I actually do believe I could manifest them, I just don't know them enough to be sure that would be right.

Reason is:

You most likely wont get any good 5* hero. But on avarage youll get some trash 5* heroes that u can fodder.
I avarage on 2-3 each dark and light 5* fodder from one prophet event.
This will also help you to finish miracle events where u need 2 of each d/l  to complete.

Only if youre not building a team that has d/l then you should consider using prophet for other factions. 
Thats what i think anyway.

To get the good 5* d/l your option is to keep rerolling casinos until u gt the one u want.

TLJ was a legit movie, it had the feel of a Star Wars film.  Yeah, I thought there were parts that were kinda lacking.  But I felt that same way for ANH and ROTJ... 

It's not like ANH or ROTJ didn't have moments that had me scratching my head or wanting to fast forward.

But the overall message of the films and the overall feel of the OT with it's character development, lore of the Force, and that feeling of magic/mysticism and wonder was always there.

Ninth World has many similarities with medival world with twist of sci-fi and fantasy elements. Traditional medival holidays are propably safe place to start. Nearly every culture celebrates some kind of harvest festival with feasts, songs and dancing. You can maybe do something a bit wierd with that. Let's say you place your campaign in Milave (Core book p.163) and the locals are just preparing for the ganch harvest festival. Ganch harvest has to be precisely timed because stratharian war moths graze on fields during summer. Moths migrate in fall and the harvest has to be collected after the migration but before the rains fall. The locals hold huge festival in honor of the start of the migration. You can even throw a curveball and say that for some reason this year moths are not starting the migration and instead seem to start settling in for the winter, ruining the ganch harvest.

One of my favorite historical festivals is Karhupeijaiset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peijaiset) from ancient Finnish culture. Finns belived the bear was especially powerful and holy animal and every time men of a village managed to hunt down a bear the village threw a festival to honor the spirit of the animal (and to drink and eat of course.) Men would perform plays or sing songs where the bear just so happened to die accidentally so that the spirit would not hold grudge against the village, toasts were raised and villages praised how mighty the animal was so when the spirit travelled into the spirit realm it would look kindly on the village. Finally the skull of the bear was lifted on top of the largest tree in village, so that the spirit would have a easy journey to the spirit realm.  I always thought peijaiset would make a great ninth world festival, you could just switch bear for any great predator in the beastiary.

Also, core book p.220, The Revelry of Wonders in the town Broley, not necesserily my favorite festival but check it out.",1514765129

From August 30th, 1999 through July 31st, 2002 — for 1,067 days, with a 157 day gap — I kept what I called a ""life chart"". Basically, it was a record of my life, broken into fifteen minute increments and color-coded by activity (orange is driving, yellow is ice hockey, green is a social event, red is class, shaded is sleeping, etc.). This chart takes me from my senior year of high school through my sophomore year of college, from age 17 through age 20. In May of 2002, I stopped keeping good records and eventually stopped all together. Later, I created a new chart (version 2.0), but I wasn't able to keep it up.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","I knew someone was likely going to make this comment, so I suppose its fair to answer as to why. Because I find it a lot people complain or are disappointed at people and companies keeping back historical finds and information under a ""paywall"" and not giving to people historical information. As I cant speak on FineMolds behalf, I can say from someone who works in this field on a smaller scale, that its not as simple as it seems.

National Archives and other private institutes are often very expensive. When it comes to obtaining a license to use and research documents, or paying to borrow files and even take them home (per night). I personally end up spending thousands of USD a year purchasing flights to Japan, paying for Archive use, and scanning and borrowing files I feel are important to my work. I spend much, and to freely hand them over to the public unfortunately leaves me at a financial disadvantage. Earlier last year I discovered information on the Ho-Ri, including detailed blueprints. I spent a few thousand to obtain them, and then gain copyrighting over it. Gaijin Entertainment, someone who I do work for, happened to want to include the said vehicle in their game. So I sold those details to them as compensation for what I had to spend gaining them in the first place. And even then, it only covered some of it. I still hold it private for another time where I can make money.

You can call it scummy, others love to. But to someone who just goes on the internet and sees all these amazing vehicles with information on them dont realize it all was purchased by someone, and made public after gaining the money spent through various means.

"tea","t5_2qq5e","As others have said, it's important not to get too invested in tea right away, if coffee is your main business. 

Bags might be slightly more expensive than loose in terms of cost per cup, but they allow you to delay investing in infusers, etc. Infusers are also additional items that need to be washed.

I'm American, so I'm not sure if my tastes line up with what your customers will be looking for, but it shouldn't vary too much. 

Get one nice sencha, it's the green tea that no one dislikes. Some might be seeking something more sophisticated, but no one who's looking for green tea is going to be dissatisfied. 

Silver needles is great, as I said above. In my mind, when a cafe has white tea, it means that they've actually put effort into their teas. 

1st or 2nd flush Darjeeling, generally my favorite black teas. If someone is looking for black tea, they will probably appreciate this. Again, this sends the message that you're trying. 

You should probably have a second type of black tea. I don't know much about black tea, so I'm not sure what to suggest. Lots of people like Earl Grey, so you might find a good Earl Grey to have as your fourth variety. 

Those are my suggestions, please feel free to follow them as you see fit.

""The phantom time hypothesis is a historical conspiracy theory asserted by Heribert Illig. First published in 1991, the hypothesis proposes a conspiracy by the Holy Roman Emperor Otto III, Pope Sylvester II, and possibly the Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII, to fabricate the Anno Domini dating system retrospectively, so that it placed them at the special year of AD 1000, and to rewrite history[1] to legitimize Otto's claim to the Holy Roman Empire. Illig believed that this was achieved through the alteration, misrepresentation and forgery of documentary and physical evidence.[2] According to this scenario, the entire Carolingian period, including the figure of Charlemagne, is a fabrication, with a ""phantom time"" of 297 years (AD 614–911) added to the Early Middle Ages.""

"MovieDetails","t5_3md1s","Yeah i feel you captured my point entirely. 

I get that there are a massive amount of movies that have the ""family"" dynamic or with heterosexual romance being the main focus, but i think it is much more of a tight rope than people think.

They will for sure offend people either way. By making the character gay the less tolerate individual might boycott it and hate everything about it..and on the flip side someone gay might be offended by their portrayal of their sexual preference and boycott and hate it as well.  

Hopefully we can come to a happy medium, where gay isn't a quirk like funny,confidant,arrogant is and more like ""well hero women settled down with Sarah and the two found peace"" rather than ""flamboyant boy dazzled everyone with their drag ray...."" 

that message gets lost when you scream ""i want more gay super hero's"" vaguely into the void.

I don't know, i am not gay so my thoughts might get immediately dismissed. i just think people are to broad and they wont like what they wish for when they shout so strongly and so vaguely.  ",1514765131

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's not too sensitive of a topic, if you can't talk about paedophilia or sex with children this stuff ends up as taboo, and the stigma continues, which is not what we want! 

And bro, I agree with you, why would I care if people are attracted to children when they have no intention to act upon it, potentially helped by therapeutic support, it's like people with crazy fetishes etc, why would I care? 

And it's important that people who *are* attracted to children feel free to talk about it, because in the current state of society they cannot, like you say it's a sensitive topic, but when people cannot talk about it they keep their problems to themselves, allowing it to brood or escalate, perhaps resulting in the *behaviour* that is the unacceptable part of the mental disorder paedophilia, if people with paedophilia feel safe and free to talk about it and look for help (without people or the media portraying them as monsters or predators), there'd be less incidence of sex offences against children

Let's hope that 2018 helps diminish the stigma against mental health! Ranging from social anxiety and depression to people unfortunate enough to be attracted to children, let's hope society as a whole becomes more open minded and nice to each other

Peijaiset (in dialectical forms peijahaiset, peijaat or peijaajaiset) is a Finnish word that in its modern usage often refers to the celebrations following a successful elk hunt (or the hunting season), but may mean celebrating also other things that have come to an end (figurative references to ""pejaiset"" over e.g. bankrupt companies occur in newspapers). Traditionally, it referred to burials, but also to other celebrations in some dialects.

My husband and I started a small business 6 years ago shortly after we had our son. It was perfect timing since I was being laid off from my job after 13 years. 
I raise our son with minimal help from him, take care of our home that he has literally never lifted a finger in, do all of the office/accounting work for our business, etc...since he leaves the house for work each day he's put himself above me in all things. 
During our last bad argument, he threatened to leave me if I didn't start giving more than the ""40%"" I'm putting into this marriage. I'm a great mother but a shitty wife according to him. 
Since he doesn't recognize anything that I do as actual work and since he can list everything he's bought me or paid for in 6 years and my list of accomplishments pales in comparison to his, I'm shit.

"exjw","t5_2qp5l","&gt; I'm not trying to be overly critical of this. I am no musician even though I have dabbled for years and studied theory, but I think I have the ability to at least recognize songs that are easy to follow vs ones that are difficult.

Just before I saw this sentence I was thinking a similar thought.  I've played an instrument and delved into music theory for many years and although I know that the 1984 Kingdom melodies were not appreciated that much, I can definitely say that through deciphering the music, it actually was more harmonically similar to music that people were already used to hearing, and therefore easier to follow.  But when the 2009 song book came out I was like WTF? and brothers were saying how great the music was, and I felt ashamed because I didn't like what they were doing.  As far as I can remember they were trying to get away from 'worldly' religious music ideas, in other words trying to separate themselves from the sound of worldly music.  Maybe not a great idea, because although everyone has different tastes, there are styles and underlying music structures which have been tested on the general public for centuries and have evolved together with what people generally find pleasing with music.  Even some of the more hard on the ears music seems to have had their origins in more acceptable genres; I think watchtower created a problem by trying to move away from commonly accepted, generally pleasing styles of music because lots of it is 'rooted' in religious history for example.  But that kind of music is tried and tested and packed with emotions for a very good reason. But watchtower, in their efforts to abandon that were throwing out the baby with the bathwater.  They created too big of a shift in my opinion. ",1514765135

Matzo, matza or matzah (Yiddish: מצה‎ matsah, Hebrew: מַצָּה‬ matsa; plural matzot; matzos of Ashkenazi Hebrew dialect) is an unleavened flatbread that is part of Jewish cuisine and forms an integral element of the Passover festival, during which chametz (leaven and five grains that, per Jewish Law, can be leavened) is forbidden.

As legend goes, the Jews did not have time to wait for the bread to leaven when fleeing Egypt hence they only consumed Matzo, this special unleavened bread. During Passover it is eaten as a flat, cracker-like bread or used in dishes as breadcrumbs and in the traditional matzo ball soup.

Matzo that is kosher for Passover is limited in Ashkenazi tradition to plain matzo made from flour and water.

As I'm working in a development agency, we're open to do it, when the project is run in an agile way. When we choose, we have a phasing approach that isn't really agile. My perception is, that usually, a customer likes to have it Agile, but can't stand the consequences of 1. not knowing what he gets at the end, and 2. not having a price tag before the work begins. 
If you are in a company that has a single project/product and you want it to succeed, Agile is great. Otherwise: Think twice.

I didn't even consider that other areas than IT use this approach :D",1514765138

Stainless steel heats up faster and conducts heat even better than cast iron. The main advantage of cast iron is that it is extremely hardy and has higher heat retention (when you add cold food the pan will still maintain a lot of heat). The high heat retention is what makes cast iron an excellent choice for searing.

With a great amount of seasoning, cast iron can also become virtually non-stick although I don't experience much sticking on my al-clad stainless pan. As long as you preheat/oil stainless steel pans well and let food sit until they're ready, stuff doesn't really stick.",1514765139

As for the rest:

- check the design of Leviathan, sprawling, massive, interconnected; for a new player, it will be like VOG due to the many secrets you can find
- Infusion and the level up process is also something streamlined, in place since TTK (and you're a Taken Tot so you know that), and it is also in place here
- getting high-end gear after major activities, or weekly free lootboxes during an event, those have been in place since D1
- not needing to go back to the tower to get bounties, and are instead replaced with Challenges/Milestones and an open destination map with activities
- Nightstalkers, Gunslingers, Sunbreakers, Strikers, Stormcallers - all with their capabilities and strengths are also still here; we had the Sentinel to provide more offensive viability for Defenders, and the Dawnblade (which kinda sucks) to remove the *'self-ress'* mechanism of Sunsingers

In our world, unless you're incredibly talented and incredibly lucky, it's very hard to be successful without school. Companies want to use someone (and yes, they will use you until you have no more value to them because companies are vicious like that) who has knowledge, so continuing school is a must if you want to find a job.   
If you do choose to continue post-secondary education, do try to apply for scholarships. I do not know if your parents will support you, but it's nice to have some income from scholarships so you can focus on your studies.

"Warthunder","t5_2uc6j","Most effective I would say is from directly above between the wings.

Not only are you presenting yourself with an unimaginably enormous target that you should be ashamed to miss, but actually manually aiming in that direction with the gunners is annoying.

When you attack from this angle, you are facing only the single pair of .50s from the turret on top between the wings, and that turret actually can only aim about 75 degrees up. At range that vertical deadzone is huge. Also from this angle, you get to leverage your height advantage. You don't need to peel off early from this angle because you can just zoom past the arcs of fire and get out of range before the turrets can get on target.

Another angle is from about wing level with the B17, from its 10 or 2 o clock position. The forward gunners can't aim that far to the sides, and the waist gunners can't aim that far forwards.

Directly below is also not a terrible choice, you're only facing the 2 .50cals from the 1 turret.

The 2 biggest pieces of advice, break off early, and try to minimize idle flying. What do you do when an enemy fighter has guns pointed at you? You evade.

And a cheeki tip that pisses bombers the fuck off.

When you damage them, peel off and inspect their flight for a short moment. Just because you didn't rip a wing off, doesn't mean it can still fly. If they're rolling uncontrollably, don't approach again. If a B17 inverts or dives straight down due to damage, it's tricky to get it back without ripping the wings off from overspeed.",1514765144

"fatestaynight","t5_31xwr","Eh. Not really.

Of course, this is might be due to coming into the series later than some, where a lot of these gender flips where much more common and having kings, Lords, and mythical figures being girls weren't out of the norm. If I came into the series earlier where Saber was one of the very FEW examples of this (such as before Grand Order went crazy with the idea), then my feelings would be different.

Still, as it is with the crazy things in this franchise I've kinda accepted it and it really doesn't bother me TOO much given that besides the...obvious things, doesn't change too much for me personally. I mean, if she was a different figure with a different backstory...eh, I dunno, wouldn't feel like Saber to me. 

We already have a standard version of Arthur (even if the stuff around him is limited due to his material), but I dunno, I like how her backstory works with her. Its weird, head turning, and insane...yeah, but given some of the other characters in the franchise, many who have nothing to do with the genderflipping? Doesn't bother me too much. 

Of course, on the topic of all that genderbending in FGO...yeah, sometimes they go a bit wacky with the concept. I don't think they overdue it...TOO much, but yeah, they took the concept and ran with it (which I think is fine given the game its from. They gotta continue to make new characters. Hell, for all we know eventually they could release versions of characters with their correct genders, like how they added in Proto-Arthur later on).",1514765147

We were talking about school.  She went to private school all of her life.  When I told her I went to public school, she asked how much our tuition was.  I was like, ummm it’s public school, so we didn’t have tuition.  I said basically taxes pay for public schools.  She got visibly upset about that, and I asked why.  She said she was pissed that her parents paid for her tuition and basically paid for everyone else’s public schooling with taxes.   I nearly flipped my shit on her.  I asked, so you would prefer that we have a country full of idiots just because their parents weren’t as well off as hers were?     
She was raised with very republican views, but ever since she left the military, her transition to the real world has been very difficult.  She was so used to having assistance or having things taken care of for her.   Now she would be considered lower-middle class as far as earning goes,  has to pay for her own health insurance out of her paycheck, doesn’t get housing assistance, etc.  So her views have been changing now that she is living in the ‘real’ world, to one that is much more empathetic.

"ethtrader","t5_37jgj","Casper isn't a fork, but a technology. A hard fork will be required to implement it. Several actually, as it will be phased in with at least two steps. The first may even be implemented soon, a hybrid PoW/PoS with Casper ""the friendly finality gadget"".

Casper is the name for one proposed implementation of Proof of Stake, a way of securing the blockchain that is different from mining (which uses Proof of Work). There are other systems proposed that all use Proof of Stake, with various trade-offs. Right now Casper is the one to beat, as Vitalik and Vlad and others are trying to plan and test and create what will become Ethereum's implementation of Proof of Stake.

Ultimately, noone knows what the price will do. That said, many have suspicions that Casper will do great things for the price, for several fundamental reasons. 1) Implementing Casper will remove a major negative for Ethereum: mining is really bad for the environment and wasteful, and full PoS will do away with it. 2) By incentivizing staking, ETH owners are incentivized to hold (and hold larger amounts) as opposed to trading. This will increase demand (as everyone will want to stake) while lowering velocity and ETH availability or circulating supply. This *should* put upward pressure on ETH assuming this isn't already priced in. 3) By making the computation side of securing the blockchain far simpler, the main chain will be much faster. In this sense Casper could be considered a sort of scaling, in a way that will synergize with other scaling technologies, so in the long-term this will help the price as well by increasing usability. A [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ethtrader/comments/7g2tc1/tweeted_today_casper_proof_of_stake_testnet_is/dqggyf7/) I made that goes into more depth about how Proof of Stake works compared to Proof of Work.

"patientgamers","t5_2t3ad","I can see what you mean to an extent, but I would argue that those changes/differences are very minor in the grand scheme of things. The combat in SH was never a strong suit, always clunky... they tried to advance it a bit here but, perhaps ironically, the end result was largely similar, and didn't alter the core 'gameplay loop' that much.  

And you do traverse a town often enough. Maybe not to the same high amount of past games, but you definitely have to plenty of times, to reach various locations. And while traversing those locations - whatever they may be, town or not - it still 'feels' very much like an SH game in most ways. I'd say that's kind of a nitpick.  

(do you even traverse the town all that much in SH3? I honestly can't remember doing so much... certainly do in 1 &amp; 2... but I could be mistaken)  

Obviously there are going to be some alterations made from game to game, to try to advance things or keep things fresh etc., and Homecoming definitely has some differences to a degree, but it's by and large like at least 80% the same as other Silent Hill games IMO. To say it doesn't feel like a SH game seems hyperbolic to me. Now, if it's a LORE thing people think makes it feel way different, that's a whole other ballgame... one I'd be interested in hearing about actually because I'm definitely rusty on my 'SH Universe' details lol.

"PlasticSurgery","t5_2qkya","By basic plan do you mean ""CW rotation + bimax advancement + genio"" or ""X mm anterior downgraft, X mm posterior impaction, X mm advancement etc,"" because the second is what you really want.

Also, if you really think you look ""deformed"" to women and no woman would give you the time of day, I can almost guarantee you're going to be unhappy with your results. Some features will look better after the surgery, and some will look worse. If the plan is good and they don't overcorrect, the surgery should be a net positive, but you are not going to come out of this looking like a model. Best case is that you're happy with your jaw and want to get a rhinoplasty because your nose has widened, but given how deformed you *think* you look now, I doubt you're going to be very happy with the jaw result itself.

Before you actually get jaw surgery I'd see a counselor/psychologist if possible. If you seriously think you have no chance at a dating life now and that no woman could be interested in you due to your ""deformity,"" jaw surgery really isn't going to fix any of that. It's easy to think ""well I'll look much better and have much more self-confidence,"" but it's more realistic that you'll be upset with your result, or that the surgery will highlight a different facial flaw, etc.

Go through before and after pictures online and ask yourself ""would I be happy looking like that after person?"" Don't ask ""how many points did that person improve?"" because they're likely starting in a worse position than you -- again, the better someone looks before the surgery, the less improvement they'll generally have. If you go through a large number of online before and afters, and you wouldn't be content looking like the people in the after pictures, then you're probably not going to be satisfied with your surgery (especially considering most of the online images are generally the best cases).

""I'm fairly confident my algorithm works"" is not a very strong indication that it's been running long.  Give it maybe 6 months to a year and re-assess.  Don't get greedy.  Friends money will cause stress to yourself and damage relationships.  It doesn't matter what is on paper or how strong you think you are, this stuff is always stressful and mentally challenges everyone who tries.

As for tracking your trades - I don't have specific US advice - but be prepared for an audit where you must produce this information.  It is not difficult really - throw every trade in a database somewhere that is securely encrypted / backed up.  I presently have systems that do ~500,000 ""trades"" a week and have worked at places that will do up to that much *per day*.  Storage and tracking them has never been an issue so you should be fine with this requirement.

For reporting you will likely be required to produce a general summary (e.g., turned over $X for $Y profit) maybe slightly broken down, but then the detail is usually only wanted for auditing.  Which may happen a lot given the new world of crypto.  But regardless if you can't produce it you are in a world of hurt - even for yourself - as being able to produce a nice PNL report each day (e.g., I made 0.5 BTC / $8k today) is probably one of the first things you will want.  Especially if you are taking investment - prepare for a comprehensive reporting system that needs to do this anyway.

So the throwaway thing makes me wonder, the original post seemed to be the girlfriend,  but now the guy, who is actually a gay guy. A little complicated, I guess. I understand gay guys like cuck too. I have no problem with that but it isn't really cuckold, is it?

 By definition cuckold is between a married man and woman and her lover. You can have your own subgenre, no doubt. If there isn't a woman in it, it just won't turn me on. I guess you have a right to post it here, but it really isn't cuckold.",1514765151

Which might have worked for some people, but I lived in the middle of nowhere, an ambulance would have taken at least 20 minutes to get there.)

I ditched the original OB practice I had with my first as well - they said they did high risk, but then kept freaking out over stuff that was pretty normal for me.  I switched to a doc that just did high risk, was much less stressed because he didn't freak out all the time, and I am nearly positive that I would have ended up with a c-section if I had stayed with the original practice.

If your LL declines to evict, you need to add him to the lease. This actually protects you. It legally makes him partially responsible for whatever issues he causes.

Did you taste the cheese at all? It can be pretty harsh fresh out of the smoker but the longer you leave it to age the mellower that smoke gets.

Freezing cheese isn't the greatest idea as it turns things like cheddar crumbly when thawed, you can't slice it any longer.

If you want it to appear smoked just spritz the blocks of cheese at the start. That moisture will attract smoke and colour the outside a bit.

When smoking anything and especially delicate stuff like cheese you want to run with your exhaust wide open...fresh smoke always.

The real answer to all your questions is to practice, smoke cheese, keep notes, smoke some more cheese, keep notes...eventually you get good at it.

* FW Blueberry 4%

* CAP Cake Batter 1%

* FW Hazelnut 1%

* FA Meringue 1%

* CAP Sugar Cookie 2%

* CAP Vanilla Cupcake (v2) 3%


Not sure if this ATF user has a separate reddit account, but KAUZ514's [Blueberry Muffin](https://alltheflavors.com/recipes/19975#adams_blueberry_muffin_by_kauz514) gets my vote if so.  If not, this is still worth a try and I'm surprised it doesn't have more reviews because it is excellent.  I've tried quite a few different recipes and this one keeps bringing me back every time I run out.


Been through over 1000 mLs of this stuff, I typically make it with FW Blueberry at 2-3% and FA Bilberry at 1-2% making the two equal 4% by weight. I really like the zing FA Bilberry gives in any blueberry situation.  I also have done 2-3 drops FLV Rich Cinnamon per 30mL for that blueberry crumble effect.  I've considered other berry combinations, but honestly haven't had enough of an urge to switch away from this blueberry/bilberry combo.",1514765153

He isn't Amalthus or Malos, who literally wanted Pyra for her true strength (Aion). Remember the seen at the end of Chapter 7? He wants the power to protect. He wants to protect, but in order to do that, he needs power. 

Okay? There are other people who exist who also help out people and their parents. This doesn't make Rex any less selfless. 

No. Morag wanted to destroy Pyra because she thought Pyra was a danger to Alrest. Whether it be Rex or Zeke, she'd still be a danger in Morag's eyes. And even if she had become Pyra's driver, I can only see her being used as a military power. Pyra wouldn't have wanted that. There's no happy ending there.

On the topic of evidence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_evidence

You don't need to find a single gene, and even then measuring the direct effects of something polygenic like this would be extremely difficult. You're setting an impossible bar for evidence. But you don't need perfection.

If a certain variant of this gene was expressed more frequently among various populations, wouldn't you concede that variance in cognitive performance among subgroups might be somewhat attributable to genetics? We know the pathway. And even then, we would have to know this by observing individuals with this said variant.

&gt; PUBLIC AFFAIRS: At what point does showing that love cross the line into inadvertently endorsing behavior? If the son says, ‘Well, if you love me, can I bring my partner to our home to visit? Can we come for holidays?’ How do you balance that against, for example, concern for other children in the home?’

&gt; ELDER OAKS: That’s a decision that needs to be made individually by the person responsible, calling upon the Lord for inspiration. I can imagine that in most circumstances the parents would say, ‘Please don’t do that. Don’t put us into that position.’ Surely if there are children in the home who would be influenced by this example, the answer would likely be that. There would also be other factors that would make that the likely answer.

&gt; I can also imagine some circumstances in which it might be possible to say, ‘Yes, come, but don’t expect to stay overnight. Don’t expect to be a lengthy house guest. Don’t expect us to take you out and introduce you to our friends, or to deal with you in a public situation that would imply our approval of your “partnership.”

You weren't  stressing out about not wanting to go to school that day,  it was actually the culmination of four years of stress and anguish and pain that hit you at once. And you reacted in the only way you knew how at that age. 

If your mother was any sort of caring person,  she should have realised that NO,  someone *doesn't* carry on that much due to wanting to skip school,  she should have realised there was a serious underlying issue which needed to be dealt with.

"SweatyPalms","t5_2v567","The cat fact is not true, and since I'm 30 minutes late, I have to post it down here so anyone will see it.

The refutation goes like this: We hear about cats surviving massive falls, so we assume cats can survive massive falls.

Cats have survived falls. But the most common case is for a cat to fall to their death, and for us not to hear about it because they're dead and it's still pretty rare.

This is an instance of [Survivor Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qd3erAPI9w) and explains a lot of things, like why people try to move to hollywood to become actors even though only ~10 people get famous per year out of tens of thousands. Or why people try to start billion-dollar startups – thousands of companies, all aiming to be worth &gt;$1b, and all convinced they're on that track – even though it's remarkably rare to actually start such a company.

Also Reddit, fix your stupid algorithm so that new comments appear at the top for a very short while so that they can gather upvotes instead of instantly hiding them at the bottom of threads regardless of how good they are. HN has been kicking your ass at this for a decade now and it's ridiculous you haven't stolen their good ideas.

EDIT: [Posted below by IICVX](https://www.reddit.com/r/SweatyPalms/comments/7nb0og/9_lives_cats_eyes/ds0p0vi/):

&gt; It turns out cats generally do well [if they fall from either less than 2 stories or greater than 6 stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-rise_syndrome). Less than that and they tend to survive because they're basically a liquid, more than that they tend to survive because they can deploy their inner flying squirrel. 

And since &gt;2 stories or &lt;6 stories is a common case, that's why falling can be deadly to cats.

EDIT2: My previous edit was incorrect, and that should tell you something about the forces at work here.

Watch the video. He makes a convincing case that this cat fact is straight up wrong. It's not true that cats can *usually* survive falls from &gt;6 stories. We just don't hear from the ones that splat.

It's very interesting just how powerful survivorship bias is. Look at all the replies saying how wrong it is, and genuinely defending that cats do not splat if you drop them from a massive distance. That they somehow become flying squirrels because they have time to relax in mid air. The very idea is ridiculous, and *of course* it's false.

But even while I was writing this originally, I still second guessed myself and read a reply and put in an edit like ""Well, it's actually &gt;2 stories but &lt;6 stories."" What? No. Cats die from falling just like humans. They're smaller, so it's less fatal. But it's still usually fatal.

You won't find a scientific study confirming this. Just like you won't find a study confirming the efficacy of parachutes. *Of course* you die without a parachute, just like cats. But you don't need a study to realize this.

But let's not drop cats to find out, ok? :) There are some things humans shouldn't try to prove.

"BlackPeopleTwitter","t5_33x33","&gt;If you're given the choice between working or starving, it's not a choice.

I agree. That's not a real choice. The problem is you need to prove that this is the case in a capitalist system.

And if we look into it, I believe, we will find this to be untrue. 

Firstly, in *any* economic system, you have to work or starve. There is no way around this. However, to advance this further I'll take it that you mean ""the worker is given the choice to work for an employer at an extremely low wage, or starve. This is not a real choice"".

Now to address that, I'll point out that there is a misrepresentation: the idea that the worker only has the choice of one employer. This is not the case at all, and actually, is the case more so in non-capitalist systems. In reality, the worker has the choice of who they're employer will be, *and*, if there is none satisfactory or for any other reason, the worker can be her own employer. A capitalist system, contrary to what socialists would say, does allow the poor access to starting capital via banks, loans or other capitalist investors.

So that is how there is definitely a choice.

To elaborate on how there workers do have autonomy: 

The workers do have negotiating power because in a capitalist system the employers have to compete in the ""labour market"" for workers. This drives wages up to compete for workers. 

Lastly, any alternative system provides far less choice, and worse outcomes for workers. I wouldn't like to pretend capitalism is a utopian system because it isn't, but it's better than any other system (which do market themselves as utopian).

In the likely case my explanation is poor, check out this video, and also Milton Friedman or Thomas Sowell on Youtube

I would definitely look for a different job. Since you've shown you are manager material, that will help a lot.

If you have some seasonal attraction (like a zoo, amusement park, museum, etc) I suggest applying there if there is nothing else available at the time. May just be part time but it will give you income while you look for another job. I, personally, suggest looking into admissions. I worked at a zoo this summer and loved it. I also know hospitals hire quite a bit. Could be in housekeeping or food services but might pay more than what you are making now. Just a few suggestions. I don't know if any of those will help.

"videos","t5_2qh1e","I think the main reason Episode VIII is so frustrating to watch and the reason many fans feel disillusioned in the ways Johnson had taken the story is that the stakes were raised so much in favor of the threads and plot-lines it introduced while seemingly ignoring all the groundwork Episode VII had been seeming to set up.

This is where the main point of subverting expectations has gotten all the fanbase in some large tizzy. No one really feels satisfied in what was presented, since it could have been taken in so many different directions. The movie has already been released obviously so we're stuck with what we got, and not all of it is even bad mind you, it's just certain expectations I think were built in people's heads for a reason.

&gt;Are you saying him killing his father makes him irredeemable

In a traditional story telling sense, I think you summed it up there friend. In my mind, Kylo Ren would have been a much more interesting character if he were written in a way that was completely subserveant to Snoke and ever searching for a greater power within the dark side. Really give us an understanding of why Luke would be so fearful of some wimpy kid turning with practically no training. It's here that more backstory and how Snoke was able to transform Kylo Ren initially would've been beneficial. 

&gt; There's a whole back story explaining Luke and Ren's conflict

It's only like three scenes in the movie where we are given actual glimpses of the past between the two characters, not nearly enough focus is given on this thread.

It just seems odd that such a great character design set up with so much potential in the previous Episode seems thrown out the window in favor of achieving, like you say, a balance in the force. This is where a lot of people's personal interpretation of how to necessarily achieve that differs from what we are given in the films.

*Personally*, I side with the idea that balance with the force can only be achieved if the dark side and a desire for ever greater power is shunned. It's why the Jedi are seen as so powerful and were peacekeepers of the galaxy after all. This definition is being redefined with the new trilogy however, and it really is a wonder if we are going to get a better resolution with the next installment. 

As of right now, I would say the consensus of how 'The Last Jedi' ended is that Kylo Ren is still evil, attuned and corrupted by the dark side of the force and his hatred for Luke, and Rey and the remnants of the Resistance will have to defeat the First Order once again. So why so much meandering and canonical changes if we're going to end up where we thought anyway? It really feels like there is so much artificial weight to the movie, in its effort to surprise fans that it feels like we aren't even being delivered on a tonally consistent story that fits within the greater universe.",1514765167

[Inkberry](https://www.thespruce.com/densa-inkberry-holly-versatile-native-option-2131850) a deer and rabbit resistant hedge plant [native from Maine to Texas](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ilgl).

[Winterberry](https://www.thespruce.com/winterberry-holly-shrubs-2131220) is a berry producing shrub native to [parts Eastern Canada into the Mid South US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilex_verticillata).

[Virginia Sweetspire](https://www.thespruce.com/virginia-sweetspire-for-fall-color-2132731) a small shrub with wacky spring flowers and good fall color.  [Native range from IL/PA/NJ south](https://plants.usda.gov/core/profile?symbol=ITVI)

[Red-osier dogwood](http://www.mortonarb.org/trees-plants/tree-plant-descriptions/red-osier-dogwood) flowers in the spring and shows cool red stems in the winter.  [It grows throughout Canada and in much of the US](https://www.fs.fed.us/wildflowers/plant-of-the-week/cornus_sericea.shtml)

"iranprotests","t5_a08ep","I think for the time being the subreddit is not in a position to censor views because of where they may originate from. But one thing should be clear, the nature of this subreddit and t_d is completely different and will remain that way.

So far, however, I've only seen one instance of MAGA like talk and it wasn't inflammatory or rude so I don't think it's a matter that needs immediate attention as such. Keep in mind that less than a day into the creation of a subreddit it's hard to say which direction it may take and the culture of the subreddit is still forming. If this subreddit devolves to a point where it is no longer conducive to discussion of the subject at hand, or becomes about the protests from a US-centric point of view, then it will be time for restrictions.

I'm always open to suggestions and have been looking for people to help me moderate this sub as its growing at an immense pace. Please feel free to PM me if you want to help with moderation, but keep in mind that no point of view will ever be censored in this subreddit as long as it is presented in a non inflammatory and polite manner.

Many of the clients know each other, so anything I share with one could easily spread. I didn't make this post asking about the philosophy of sharing my last name, and while I appreciate and understand your perspective, it's not one I personally hold.

"MemeEconomy","t5_3gl3k","Whenever I get a package of plain M&amp;Ms, I make it my duty to continue the strength and robustness of the candy as a species. To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round. I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world. Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.” This week they wrote back to thank me, and sent me a coupon for a free 1/2 pound bag of plain M&amp;Ms. I consider this “grant money.” I have set aside the weekend for a grand tournament. From a field of hundreds, we will discover the True Champion. There can be only one. ",1514765171

He calls a Highlander player ""Best Highlander in EU"" (no discredit to the player) for starting with backstepping light into heavy a majority of the time, not even trying to parry anything. Moreover, he switches to Shaman to beat Highlander, one of the best characters in the game versus arguably THE worst character in the game because he's having too much trouble beating HL with Aramusha. And he's proud of himself for beating Highlander with Shaman and speaks about them as if they're on equal terms, and attributes his win on Shaman to his ""skill with Shaman"" as opposed to the fact that they're literally on opposite ends of the tier list.

---

If you can stomach more than a few minutes of that, you can tell why I've always had a problem with True. He isn't a bad player but neither is he particularly great mostly because he has an extremely narrow point of view and absolutely doesn't understand weaknesses of a character. While I wouldn't call for any silencing of someone's opinions, I do think his opinions are unhealthy for anyone listening to them.

He can go on and on about a character's strengths and talk about them as if there are no ways to deal with them regardless of which one it is so long as he's losing, and I'm pretty sure he thinks the whole cast is close in balance somehow. His only fallback is that he says he ""might be wrong"" before any assumptions he ever makes so that he can take it back whenever necessary.

---

Great little guide. In my own experience- other than with perfect parry kings with crazy punish on characters like Shaman or Cent, I've had continued success as Warden utilizing my side lights just letting them go, while also pretending to miss attacks with a delayed shoulder bash so that they go for either a GB or some kind of approach only to be caught by SB. This is almost definitely because everyone who fights Warden is pretty much conditioned never to expect anything other than top light from a Warden.

Doesn't work forever though, of course.",1514765175

"streamentry","t5_3f7zb","Indeed, in fact, all emotions are caused by thought-desires, and from that desire arises a concept of what should or shouldn't be. When I feel the emotional object anger, it's because the happening in the now doesn't match the concept-object of how it ""ought"" to be, this concept arises from desire. Desire creates mental concepts and then attempts to force the world to conform to that concept, when the happening of now meets those expectations I feel pleasant emotions, when it doesn't meet those demands I feel unpleasant emotions. One moment I feel anger and the next happiness, I remain to witness the changes and therefore cannot be either. In seeing that the substantive subject does not change and remains to witness all changes, the attachment to these objects dissolves, for I see they have no substance. Take the moment you read what I wrote about fear for example, in that moment you realized that the mental object of fear has no substance of its own, and it's your attachment/aversion which empowered it to dominate your life. So, you can see now how the direct seeing into the true nature dissolves all bonds and liberates one from suffering. Whether one feels the objects of elation or suffering, rest assured it is the result of desire placing demands upon the world, and that these two aspects are, in fact, not separate but are rather one in the same - namely, desire.",1514765181

"NoFap","t5_2skrn","Bro, you can't wait to feel better, it is inside you, you need to bring it out by yourself. The difference between PMO and Nofap is that you start getting a clear mind, the PMO has depressed our way to think clear. The energy you receive from Nofap during this journey is like fuel for you, you choose to use it to do other stuff, there is the change. You will notice that you are more active in life, feeling happier and get more shit done. Also you will feel more confident talking to people, girls for example, not looking down but instead be able to look people straight in the eyes, this energy is really the key to our success in life. 

So don't wait, start to study yourself and find out who the true person you are and are ment to be brother! Go get it, work from the inside out, meditation is a good thing to do, it will open doors for you =)! 

One thing, I don't mean that you will not feel anything if you wait for it, I just say that the biggest difference is in your actions, and if you don't put this energy you get from Nofap on something else, sooner or later it will find it's way out from you physically (relapse). ",1514765183

Basically, some pirates pillage the nearby villages every so often.  In fact, they're doing it right now and the people will soon die if no one helps them.  Of course, Luke doesn't do anything about it and says Jedi do not interfere is the lesson but Rey cannot stand by and through the power of being a Mary Sue, uses Force super speed to get there - of which I believe she does so not by walking but running on water (one upping even Jesus Christ).

When she gets there, she learns it was just a lie from Luke as everyone is just celebrating a festival.

She returns to Luke and addresses his Bah Hambug attitude by crying and whatever.

And so, I don't think the director's cut will fix or explore anything we haven't already seen.  If anything, it might make it worse.",1514765184

"TrueFilm","t5_2szp0","**Kundun** (1997), directed by Martin Scorsese: This film, IMO, was quite boring. I don't know what, but it just doesn't hold up and keep my interest. And I think I know why. Roger Ebert wrote about *Kundun* that “Unlike Scorsese's portrait of Jesus in *The Last Temptation of Christ*, this is not a man striving for perfection, but perfection in the shape of a man.” This, IMO, is where this film is flawed. We as an audience find flawed and tortured characters much more compelling than characters who are perfect in virtually every way. Even Jesus as depicted in the Holy Scriptures is, despite his Godly nature, is shown clearly to be a tortured man, as he struggles to accept God's will while praying in the Garden of Gethsemane. But Dalai Lama, as depicted in this film, was perfectly boring. He was almost entirely composed, as he wasn't emotionally tortured almost ever. This makes for boring viewing, and we're left with good visuals and a good soundtrack, which, despite being good, are meant only to enhance a film, not to carry it. So that is why I found *Kundun* to be boring.",1514765187

Making 8 different patterns isn't dependent on Ableton, anybody can do that. They use Ableton for the examples because the guy who wrote the book works there and its a brilliant marketing tie in. As demonstrated by the fact that the book sold out within the first day it was released. ",1514765187

What makes it misleading is that in Klopps system it isn't the pressing/defending midfielders out of possession who sits the furthest back of the 3 (or 4 in a diamond) but rather its the deep pivot/playmaker who does

The centerbacks push wide, the pivot sits back and the two other midfielders press their space. That couldn't be more different to what most people mean by a DM

fwiw Liverpool also don't play with box-to-box midfielders or wingers - yet these terms also get thrown around and don't fit. If you want to talk about these roles and players so that other people understand you you need to be able to distinguish between them and communicate it correctly

WindowsMR is not unique in people asking for tech support help.

&gt;What are the fixes to the blurry view unless you are looking straight ahead

Are you sure you even own a VR headset?  That's called the ""sweet spot"" and exists with all headsets because of the fact that they have lenses.  Google it and you'll find all kinds of people talking about it comparing it between headsets.

It's complicated. 
It's a privilege answer to say, ""don't worry, just enjoy it,"" as I'm inclined to do. Sometimes people need to know and explore things. 

For me, it's a  reversed turn on. 
I'm aroused by your post because I'm attracted to sissies - straight guys who love cock and are humiliated by it. 

In my online adventures, someone who has always loved cock or is gay and dresses up - does nothing for me. Boner straight into the ground. 

But in addition to my sex life and ""heteronormative"" (?) porn, men and women who are ""forced"" to homosexual activity and hate it and love it and are aroused by it, are an incredible turn on. 

Guys who only suck when dressed. Super hot to me. 

I fantasize about guys who are dressed and locked, sucking only because they are desperately horny. 

Or girls (&amp; guys, too, as I type this) who are teased and edged over and over until they beg to eat/ suck - huge turn on. 

Tears of helpless arousal and lust and humiliation really fuel the fire. 

OP, your post is an interesting question - FWIW, I consider you straight. I guess I'm bi because I'd love to push my cock between your reluctant lips. 

Not into anal either.

"Advice","t5_2qjdm","I think the first thing to tackle would be hygiene, since that's the (somewhat) easier thing on the list. Not sure if you being body odor or bad at brushing teeth, but either way this is the first thing I'd look to help her with.

Perhaps for weight you could offer to help her -- maybe that's helping her on portion sizes or maybe that's hitting the gym or taking a jog around town or even just walking the length of the mall. 

As far as academics, I'd say either offer to tutor her (if you actually can) or just offer to help her find a tutor. (Colleges also offer free tutoring for most, if not all, classes in addition to many professors offering tutoring with either themselves, a colleague, or a qualified graduate student, so perhaps nudge her into using those resources when she goes to college.) 

This part may or may not help -- and I don't know how it would sound coming from you, since you get better grades it sounds -- but I'd even mention that at the end of the day, it's not necessarily what grade you received, but how much you learned. Don't get me wrong, good grades are needed to get into college and to get that degree, but they aren't everything. For me, I'm literally only going to college because I literally can't get hired full-time without a degree. For both jobs I currently hold (neither are trade jobs), everything I know about the jobs were learned on-the-job and none of my skills were learned in school. Now, is that the same for everyone? Of course not. But, my point is that, to me (and perhaps I'm wrong here) what you were able to learn is more important than a grade. (Not to mention there are times you learn things that you will literally never ever need in life.) 

For bullying, it sounds like she doesn't directly have that going on right now, but with that I'd just say that in college, it's easy to move past that. In high school, everyone was breathing down my neck about what I was doing. In college, people don't do that. (And it's not cause I don't have friends in college, it's just that they're not nosy like some people I knew in high school.) ",1514765193

What about Cuban food? Ropa vieja is meant to be slow cooked so the meat should stay good. Moros y cristianos are just black beans &amp; rice with a bit of fat for moisture - simple, hardy, doesn't involve meat but easy to add meat if desired, and would still be delicious if kept hot for hours.

Lentils are another option. Healthy, infinitely flexible on flavor, hardy, and would hold up just fine for hours. I like lentil chili myself :) but you can do everything from lentil ""meat""loaf or ""meat""balls to curries and stews.

I saw you mentioned that you prefer fish but I don't see any way to do hot fish with what you have. It's going to end up overcooked or dry. Instead, consider fish dishes to be served cold: Ceviche &amp; poke would be amazing. Cold grilled salmon on a salad is always good. Tuna salad would work great on sandwiches or salads.

2.The gospel of John is entirely reliable as a way to understand the meaning of Jesus’ life, death and resurrection. It’s not written as a historical document. 

3. Nope. I think that “miraculous birth” was shorthand for “this ones a big deal”, and it’s hard to get more miraculous than born of a virgin. 

4. I don’t know enough to make a call. I think those stories say as much about the Babylonian captivity as anything else. Again, literal truth of events only gets me so far.

Edit 2: Thank you to the poeple who actually discussed their thoughts on this instead of just rage downvoting without discussing.

Beside the fact the article says

&gt; Nintendo easily had a better year than any of their competitors.

but the title says

&gt; THE NINTENDO SWITCH WON 2017, PLAYSTATION 4 A CLOSE SECOND

My biggest problem is if you remove Zelda and Mario from the Switch lineup it's just so meh. Remove Horizon Zero Dawn and Persona 5 from the PS4 lineup and it's still solid very solid and arguably still a fantastic year with Nioh, Nier, Uncharted, Assassins Creed etc.

Also some of the games the article owner mentioned are just ports on plain and simply playable on PS4.

&gt; * The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
* Super Mario Odyssey
* Splatoon 2
* Xenoblade Chronicles 2
* Pokken Tournament DX (Port)
* Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (Port +DLC)
* 1-2 Switch (Garbage Game)
* ARMS (Meh reception)
* Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle
* L.A. Noire (This came out on the PS4 on the same day)
* DOOM (Playable on PS4)
* Rocket League (Playable on PS4)
* Skyrim (Playable on PS4)
* Ultra Street Fighter II (Poor Reviews)
* Sonic Mania (Came out on PS4)
* Yooka-Laylee (Came out on PS4)
* and so much more. (Like what they've mentioned every big game + all the big ports there's not much more)

---

After removing the ports and stuff available on a playstation console + any badly received games.

&gt; * The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
* Super Mario Odyssey
* Splatoon 2
* Xenoblade Chronicles 2
* Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle
* Fire Emblem Warriors (Was forgotten in the original article.)

That's not a big lineup if you own a PS4 and a Wii U.

Here's the list they gave for Playstation

&gt; * Horizon Zero Dawn
* Nioh
* Nier Automata
* Persona 5
* Resident Evil 7 in VR
* Yakuza 0
* Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age
* Uncharted: The Last Legacy

This is strictly exclusives that aren't on Xbox or PC as well.

Add in games that they forgot or didn't come to switch (considering we're strictly comparing the Switch lineup and PS4.)

* Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue* (PS4 exclusive (*Kingdom Hearts 0.2: Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage is new content))
* For Honor
* Injustice 2
* Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy* (*Probably can't include this due to it being a port however it's over 20 years old the game so I feel like it's almost a fresh experience)
* Pyre
* Madden, NHL, NBA Live (Switch got Fifa and NBA2k18 but so did PS4)
* The Evil Within 2
* South Park: The Fractured but Whole
* Assassin's Creed Origins
* Wolfenstein II: The New Colossus (We're strictly looking at 2017 in review and this game isn't out for the switch yet)
* Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice
* What Remains of Edith Finch (Idk much about this but great reviews and hit a couple of top 10 lists for the year)

**Conclusion/TD;DR**

There's about 6 solid non ports on the Switch that came out this year that aren't also on the PS4. There's around 6-8 on the PS4 that are PS4 exclusives. Add in all the other games that aren't on the switch and you have a list of about 20+ games that were well received AAA games.

It depends on what you're doing too, the one beach town I stay at in the summer almost everyone is drinking very basic drinks, most of the bars don't even have more than the generic Bud Light type drinks. It's a party town where people get fucked up, and the system works well for that kind of place because nobody is drinking anything special. If you're at a nice dinner somewhere and you want a nice tasting beer, it might not work as well, but you're also probably not getting as wasted and will have an easier time calculating how much alcohol you're having. 


I think where people would probably fuck up the most from using these guidelines is drinking mixed drinks that your friends made. When your friends have a tendency to put four shots of vodka into a drink, you're probably gonna be off in estimating how much alcohol you've had. ",1514765202

I think the only thing in terms of production that you might be able to blame on Bryant is an under utilization of the tight end but that as much system as anything else.  Deon, Hunter, and Ray-Ray have pretty similar production numbers (except TDs).  Yes Deon is the deep threat, but outside of that he has managed to spread the ball out fairly effectively.  Any perceived lack of production from everybody else probably has more to do with how many receivers we play in a given game.  We had 23 people catch passes this year.  That's a lot.

"programming","t5_2fwo","Thanks for the explanation. You're right that Go does implement its own TLS stack too but you can use the system CA bundle/loads certs directly instead of having to manage them outside of your program. Is Java just using the standard Mozilla CA bundle or does it use that plus the OS's trusted chain (for example, Microsoft has some CAs of their own)?  Just curious because the OS itself can have one chain, the browser another and depending on the OS there may be a third chain (such as the mozilla CA bundle).

Anyway, IMHO SSL termination is best handled outside of whatever language you choose to use....it's a lot simpler and delegates the duty of handling SSL to something which was designed for doing just that (load balancer/web server/etc).

&gt; Just curious, why you don't like java?

Fair question. For me it's amount of overhead introduced by the language in multiple areas (memory usage, forced OOP, debugging, project setup/layout, etc) and the level of abstraction even simple programs can end up with. For the situations I typically encounter on a daily basis (microservices, network services, systems programming and embedded programming) it's faster and often easier to deploy non-java programs. Plus many of the services or that I am extending (ex. Docker/etcd/kubernetes/Ansible/etc) are not Java so Java does not make a lot of sense for me.

I guess 'like' is the wrong word on my part here. Don't get me wrong, Java can be a powerful language and is a great tool to have under one's belt but I've seen it often forced into situations where another option could get the job done faster and with less overhead. So I could like Java but it's not always the most optimal tool for many things I do. That's why I'm asking questions,  because I want to have a better understanding so I know where Java may better fit into the work I do.",1514765206

Americans are awesome people and a lot of them (most of them?) are VERY similar to Canadians.  I especially enjoy talking to Americans that live in hockey mad areas (like Minnesota or Philly).  Hockey is life and hockey is love.

"MandelaEffect","t5_2zejk","Simply put words of God are truth, but humans are just humans. Not every idea is easily understandable and even harder to write down on paper. Not to mention humans in the past where less developed in all aspects.

Even if God would for example make someone aware of evolution, then that person would get a hard time explaining and getting people to believe in ancient times. And the knowledge of evolution isn't the lesson that was needed in any way to be learnt. It's nice to know it, but it's not neccesary for anything in spiritual sense. But the lesson that we are able to good and bas and animals don't is far more important in spiritual sense. To know that the gift of knowledge means you cannot be arogant any longer. We are the ones that think, so we cannot no longer be arogant to world and it's hardships, therefore we no longer can be in the Garden. 

Just because word of God is true doesn't mean He haven't used alegories to present concepts to use.

Onto that we need to add humans being faulty and changing stuff throughout ages both by mistakes and for personal gains. Judaism was practically controlled by ancient Jew kingdom and who knows what parts of Old Testament are really word of God and what's just old propaganda and non-religious law. That's why Christians kinda take Old Testament lightly. New Testament is way newer and if something doesn't add up one may believe that Son of God knows better than mere humans before. But even New Testament should be looked upon with scrutiny as Popes and friends weren't really the best at being apolitical.

Good rule of thumb is that both Jesus and parts of Old Testament that serve no use for personal gain were very rarely said/written in up-front way. Nearly always in some alegory or anegdote. We can assume that is the way God said something. Rest is mostly assumed true, but more in a way ""we cannot prove this ain't the word of God, so we better stay true to it, but we won't throw you out of church for not throwing stones at your wife if she cheats at you as that's highly unlikely to be word of God considering New Testament, etc. and is probably just some shit thrown into scripture by ancient jewish society.""

That's at least how Catholic Church interprets Bible in my region of the world.",1514765212

"StarWars","t5_2qi4s","I think the new trilogy is headed to where KOTOR 2 already went, to deconstruct the constants in this universe, namely the Force, and the ideologies of the Jedi and Sith to interpret it. They tried to tear down these religions and find something somewhere in the middle, between the two extremes, but the middle always falls to the dark side. Anything less than light will eventually fall to dark. The Force actively tries to ""balance"" itself towards light, no matter the cost of life.

I think the characters in the new trilogy will eventually learn of the same failure as Kreia.

For true balance, there needs to be a reconciliation between the two extremes, where when the Jedi do not value conflict, they stagnate, and where the Sith do not value peace, they destroy themselves and anything in their way.

I own a small camper that I take on trips, but I'm done with it and ready to go home after a few days.

Might be OK to be on the road 80-90% of the time, but not forever, especially as you move into your late seventies and beyond.   Maybe local county governments need to rethink minimum size requirements for structures on rural properties, and allow people to live there full-time in RVs, at least in winter.  Even out in the country you can't just put anything anywhere.   A cheap structure like [this](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/86/af/5c/86af5c9be4ad2613a3df21aabb6a5361.jpg) would be ideal for an RVer taking a break from the road.

I'd recommend using a cable remote or a universal remote, with the co opdes in the back of the soundbar's manual.  

If those codes don't work, then look in the back of your cable/universal remote's manual, or onscreen prompts, and use the codes listed for Klipsch or RCA if you don't see them listed.

RCA-branded codes are commonly used as an alternative for audio devices.

So far we don’t have a lot of advice from the school but once it’s back in session after the break we hope to connect with the administrators.

From the school so far I heard that he needs to go to school but that they can’t basically hold him and have him throw a fit all day or run out of the school. At that point I just have to go get him anyway.

I’m probably over anxious about it because of the change happening so quickly.

The counselor also said he has to go to school and doesn’t get to choose but I’m stuck because he is so strong willed we could stand there all the school day in the office and he wouldn’t ever go in. I’d imagine soon the school will have some suggestions for us. This only has started happening in the past two weeks anyway.

We do have an appointment with a new psychiatrist because we didn’t like the first one. She wasn’t good at all with kids. So we’ll see how that goes.",1514765219

It takes awhile to mobilize SWAT?  Police have a lot of procedure that they have to follow.

&gt;Seems more like they just go by whatever the call says.

Like I said, I'm not sure what the actual procedure is.

&gt;Maybe they could stop allowing anonymous calls and go right to the caller's house first and talk to them face to face. 

What if you can't trace the call?  That you don't know who is phoning?

I really think that the way to stop this kind of prank is saying, ""You call in a prank like this, you face jail time.  Someone is injured or has property damage because you called in a SWAT?  You reimburse them and face even MORE jail time.   Someone gets killed because you called in a prank SWAT?  You face murder charges.""

As much as I love TJ his not prim &amp; prop, and I used to hear he was a grabber at meet ups. That’s just TJ and we still love him for who he is.

I don’t think TJ hated being part of the Drunken Peasants, I think he really wanted to try something else. 
What confuses me is why not schedule his own Podcast on seperate days than DP and / OR keep Paul &amp; Scotty on DP but he do something else on different days with then (incl. Ben or without Ben)

Clearly he does not hate Ben and honestly that would of been a win - win situation for everybody.

All this could be fixed if they reset and used a different kind of ranking system, though, at least for setting up matchmaking.

And if you are going to go 6 levels of paladin for the aura, you may as well go to 7 for the Aura of Warding from Oath of Ancients to get resistance to all damage from spells. But that loses out on your 14th level of Warlock and your final patron benefit. It also means if you wanted to keep your max 5 ASIs, you'd be better off going up to Paladin 8 and Warlock 12, but then you're giving up your 7th level Arcanum spell for that. With options like *Plane Shift* and *Power Word Pain*, I find that very difficult to give up.

Mostly, the above-mentioned build is for focusing damage and spellcasting options, as well as holding the primary flavor to warlock. It is primarily offense, and doesn't worry too much about defense because it wants to Smite anything that can hurt it into pulp before it gets the chance.

"Career_Advice","t5_2v78q","Business training is a great choice. I know a few people who got into it and love it.

I've career coached for quite a few years, and from all that work the pattern that usually comes up is perfectionism. You want to pick the thing you will like most, and has the best chance of working (paying you enough, fitting what you like to do)... but such it's a big choice, we opt into over-thinking. Perfectionism just means waiting for the perfect information before you make the move. Problem is you'll never know what you'll like or what works best before you do it. It's like taking a sip of a drink you've never had before. 

Best thing I've done, and what everybody else has done is just pick the choice that feels right, right now. Career in its root form actually means journey. In thinking of careers we usually think 1 destination for the rest of my life. When usually it's a series of adjustments. And everybody has multiple things they love doing (that are paying professions).

**Cooldown - 25 seconds**

Ability 2: **Soresu Focus** - For 10 seconds Obi-Wan can block attacks from all angles with his lightsaber, nor can he be stunned. Explosives deal 25% less damage to him as well.

Any attempts to Heavy Strike Obi-Wan will result in a Saber Lock where Obi-Wan has an advantage.

Ability 3: **Saber Throw** - This behaves identically to Vader's version of this from BF 2015.

**Old Ben Kenobi**

**Health - 575**

Ability 1: **Mind Tricks** - Identical to Rey's version from the Beta. Except its legit now cuz Old Ben's the OG mind tricker.

**Cooldown - 15 seconds**

Ability 2: **Old Jedi Master** - Old Ben goes off the minimap and can sprint 10% faster for 15 seconds. Nearby friendly infantry will receive the Cooling Cell and Focus Fire buff for 8 seconds. Meanwhile enemies that Old Ben runs by will have their blasters overheat faster.

First I found out that the app ""ES File Explorer"" will list your apps by most recently updated (under Library -&gt; APP), so that answered my first question. Unfortunately that wasn't even helpful here - all of them were pretty legit and weren't using any memory in the last few hours anyway.

I gave Google another go using different keywords and discovered [this solution](https://android.stackexchange.com/a/122726), and now I feel silly for not having tried it earlier. I tapped my app switching button while on the lockscreen and sure enough, the name of the offending app appeared at the top.  It's friggin **BestMe Selfie Camera** and I'm almost positive that was the app causing the lockscreen to pop up in the past too. I don't take ""selfies"" very often but I used it earlier today, and I installed it in the first place because it doesn't flip the image horizontally after snapping the photo like the default camera does (I'm not the most photogenic ok, don't be flippin my face yo).  Looks like loading the app triggered the lockscreen again, even after it had been closed.  Oh I am so having a word with Google about this.

Yes, you learn new notes to add to your knowledge, but you can also use the instrument as you are used to and never use the trigger.


When one learns any instrument that has such a function (f attachments, Bb side, high F side, Eb side, D, G, etc etc etc), it is just treated as new notes on the instrument.  It's not as if you are doing some special math in your head such as:

""Okay depress the trigger now I am in Bb, add a flat, okay release, I am back in F remove a flat, read down a 4th"".

Playing a double horn/triple horn, tenor with F attachment, double valve bass, etc are not difficult at all.  In fact, playing with such things is often EASIER because these instruments are higher quality and offer more options for intonation and control.  

It is not as if you are changing clefs or transposing key.  

The only exception to this is READING a transposing part and playing it on an instrument not made in that key.  Most commonly reading a C trumpet part and playing it on Bb trumpet.",1514765236

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","I'm an organ doner.  My body to science as well.  I suffered an accident that, long story short, left me a 2% survival chance.  My family was brought in to say goodbye and everyone involved assumed I was basically dead.  They could have easily harvested me, no problems at all.  Instead, a last ditch effort to save my very likely lost life was done.  Clearly, the effort paid off.

  This is in Florida where all sorts of medical fraud happens.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's a high demand for organs here too due to all the retirees.  I was a perfect candidate to just let me die for the organs.  My chances to live were so slim that parades of doctors came by after I woke from my coma just to see me.

  If I didn't get harvested illegally, I seriously have doubts that others will.   You have a chance to give life from your death.  A part of you will live on in another via the gift of your donation.  Become a doner and leave those fears behind.  If you won't donate your organs, then maybe you can at least give blood or plasma.

A year after that moment, it was me consoling him after having lost his job. Now, years later, he's a happy man with a great family.

2 - Ripple has great products and software that is already being tested and used in real world scenarios. Xrapid, Xcurrent. They are also working on smart contracts and have open sourced their smart contracts code. This is a something that we will start seeing more and more and has massive potential.

3 - Ripple is faster (tx) than all the other major coins. 1500 transactions per second.

4 - Ripple has the lowest transfer costs of any other major crypto currency.

5 - Ripple is backed by a great company with amazing staff such as Brad and David.

6 - Ripple has been stable and growing positively since 2012. Its here to stay and only growing.

7 - When more banks and FIs start using Ripple and XRP, the transactions will blast through the roof, which will increase the demand.

8 - Ripple has a great road map and plans to improve decentralization for XRP.

9 - Ripple has been signing up more and more partners every month with many big names still to join. This will also eventually increase price and adoption rates.

10 - Ripple has a history of growth and success.

11 - Ripple has seen over 20 000% growth in 2017.

12 - Ripple has surpassed etherium and is now the number 2 coin acoording to market cap, and is still growing.

13 - Everytime when there is an overall drop seen in all the altcoins or BTC, Ripple shows positive increases. Ripple stays very stable after each pump, forming clear new channels untill the next breakout. This is very reassuring, especially for value holders.

14 - Ripple is constantly on television with major channels such as bloomberg or cnbc. When Brad is being interviewed, he often gets asked a lot of difficult questions about ripple, sometimes negative questions towards ripple, and each and every time he answers with facts and statistics that is mind blowing.

15 - Ripple's vision to create an internet of value, including all their goals and lineups for 2018 is something to get excited about.

Ripple is awesome. It will surpass BTC once more people start to realize that BTC is limited, expensive, slow and falls short from what XRP and Ripple has to offer. The technology offers a much better implementation and practical application of blockchainand ledger technology.

I have bought my first XRP in November / early December when XRP was still about .40 and so far have been enjoying the hold. The community for XRP / Ripple is awesome with a lot of help on reddit and discord that has helped me a lot.",1514765239

Sure, maybe you don't care about these little details, but many fans will get annoyed if you don't get them right, especially if your change serves no purpose. A beta-reader can point out these little things for you and then you can change them. It's almost no work for you and your readers will appreciate it a lot. Unless you don't care about your readers at all, but then I wonder why you would be posting your fics online. Either that or just put an author's note at the beginning that you're not going to bother with details like that. It's not that strange that new readers go in and expect you to get these things right and then get annoyed when you don't. It's okay to deviate from the norm, but it's always best to mention that to your readers so they know what they are getting into. Otherwise you can't really get mad that they get frustrated.

I’d also like to say that- assuming he is open and receptive - opening up a line of communication about this situation with your SO is really important. Sometimes it can be really difficult to find fault in our Nparents as we are just too lenient with our justification for their behaviors. “Well, they’re just super religious and concerned about my spiritual health.” is just another way of excusing unacceptable behavior. 

As gently as you can, explain to him how you feel. Let him know that this is unacceptable and needs to stop.

If he is unwilling to talk to them, or if you don’t think he was firm enough, I’d say that you are well within your rights to call his parents and let them know that if they ever try that shit again, you will be contacting the police to press charges. The parents in question will likely argue with you, but don’t listen. Just warn them and let it be so that you’ve covered your bases should it happen again. 

Let your landlord know the situation. That way, if they do attempt to break in again, you can tell them to GTFO of your home and take it up with the landlord, as it’s his apartment and he holds the authority, not them. 

Again, I’m so sorry that you’re dealing with this. I hope that they learn to respect the decisions of you and your SO. ",1514765240

""No food X hours before bed"" regimens are usually not so much about eating fewer hours out of the day - they're targeting the fact that later in the day, people are more likely to eat unhealthy foods. It's usually due to a combination of physical exhaustion, decision fatigue (it's harder for the brain to make ""good"" choices later in the day), and cultural habits surrounding desserts/snacks/etc. But regardless of why, after dinner many people eat a disproportionate amount of calories, and those calories are often ""empty.""

So having a late breakfast won't have the same effect if you have a problem with late night snacking.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","It's interesting because these networks can also hold us back. I grew up with very little and the number of sacrifices people in our community made in order to help each other made me feel warm and fuzzy at the time, but in hindsight I think it's a double edged sword.  There's a lot of ""group think"" and limiting ideas that get shared around. If you don't get out of your internal network at least a little, it's difficult to learn about new opportunities or discover social norms that lead others to be successful. I'm proud of my roots, but my success has been due to my ability to broaden my network in a meaningful way. I'm always happy to help out a neighbor, but there's a point in many communities where all free time is sort of pre-allocated with expectations. 

It's true that when you have more money you're more likely to pay to have someone repair your furnace than to ask the guy down the street to do it. But that's kind of a different topic around buying more free time (many people value their time more than their money).  If a friend asked me to help them move, I'd say yes. But most of my friends will pay for movers because they can afford it (even if just barely). Time is precious and what good is money if you can't use it to buy more free time to enjoy each other's company. 

Not really taking a stance here, but it's all a little complicated. ",1514765244

"destiny2","t5_2we4j","&gt;I don't understand why you guys think people shouldn't get good loot from grinding whatever they enjoy.

I never said that.  The point is that you can run about a million public events in the time it takes to do the raid and open all chests in the underbelly.  The number of legendaries and exotics you can get is roughly the same give or take due to rng.

&gt;Raids will give BETTER gear than them because it's alot harder, which is good, but what's wrong with enjoying public events or the story mode, or crucible or strikes? Nothing.

Did you even read all my comments?  Because I said this same thing.  From the post you are replying to:

&gt;And by the way, I DID public event all of that. It got all three of my characters up to max power in public events. Then I did the raid. Its fun, and appropriately rewarding.

Yeah! Characters get plus 3 in one stat and minus 3 in another to balance it out. Some units have a certain stat they'll actually get plus or minus *four* in instead of 3 (those are called superboons or superbanes). It's also possible to pull characters with neutral stats, and any free unit will be neutral when you get them. It's just like how a Brave nature in Pokemon will increase their physical Atk stat and decrease their Spd in the process. However, the only way to see what your character's stats are is by going to Gamepedia/Gamepress and comparing that character's level 1 or level 40 stats to what that page shows their stats to be.",1514765246

Basically nobody is willing to call themselves bi any more and even queer is starting to fall out of fashion because it implies you might sleep with men. 

But the thing that bothers me the most is that there is still such a huge stigma in the lesbian community if you do have sex with a man. Everybody is afraid and keeps it a secret from everybody else. For some reason - I guess because I am a straight male - all my friends who have had sex with men, always seem to confide in me about it. 

At one stage, 5 out of my 8 gay female friends were in sexual relationships with men and none of the rest of them knew. It just seems a really fucked up situation the amount of shame that goes along with your out sexual preference in these communities. Everybody seems so scared that their ""dirty little secret"" will ruin their reputations somehow. 

Only one of my friends eventually ""came out"" and made her relationship known to everybody because it started getting serious, eventually they moved in together. 

Meanwhile I keep all these womens' secrets. My super lesbian friend especially is terrified about anyone finding out. She is incidentally the only one of my friends who uses the word lesbian to describe how she identifies. Everybody else says gay or queer. 

Have sex with whoever you want to have sex with, whatever makes you happy. All these labels do is seem to make people's lives more difficult. ",1514765247

"GunsAreCool","t5_2uvah","You are misunderstanding what I’m saying, my man. The suggestion of a causal relationship is literally in the introduction to the text:

&gt;as evidence of crime-reducing RTC laws, now consistently generate estimates showing RTC laws **increase** overall violent crime and/or murder

Saying one thing *increases* another is a textbook “causal relationship” statement - one causes or affects the other. These conclusions cannot be drawn unless you perform an experiment, which you obviously cannot do in this scenario.

This issue permeates both sides of the argument. Unfortunately with things like this, you can never prove causation, and correlation can be deceptive.

For example, I’ll admit a counterpoint to my own argument - I say that CCW ownership correlates negatively to crime, but that doesn’t mean CCW ownership is the *cause* of lower crime. It could be an underlying effect that moves both measures - like maybe higher income areas have less crime and also more people who can afford a gun.

I’m just trying to help you understand this, it’s a very misunderstood concept in statistics. Many think that if you find correlation and a causal relationship seems reasonable, that you can assume you’ve found causation - but it can’t be proven and therefore a study claiming to find such a conclusion is bunk.",1514765248

At the end of my drinking I did the weekend drinking thing for 2 months before adding Wednesday back in and soon getting back to my normal pattern of 3x/week. Not a real good outcome to the weekend-only experiment, but the following year ('82) I was able to quit in AA. 

Some alcoholics like your man find it difficult to even skip a day, and others like myself could stop for weeks/months several times a year. 

The important point is as an alcoholic, changing his frequency or amounts drank doesn't alter anything. If he can tough it out it may even give him the illusion that he has a small measure of control, which he clearly does not.

Later in life he may want to stop for good. He'll need your care and support to help him do that.",1514765248

Tony's best season wasn't too far off from his 2nd, 3rd, 4th best seasons, beyond a slightly better TD - INT ratio and mild increase in completion percentage.  He only threw for 300+ yards one time in 2014, since Murray was exploding.&amp;nbsp;

Romo in 2014 had 34 TDs, 9 INTs.  In 2011 and 2013, he had 31 TDs, 10 INTs.  I remember 2014.  I also remember that Romo produced very similarly in prior years without all the bonus toys like a functional Oline.",1514765251

It can also cause the victim to turn to alcohol or drugs for relief, which is a reason why veterans have some of the highest rates of addiction. Addicts are also very present in the homeless population, both because their addiction makes it difficult to work, as well as the fact that most addicts will spend whatever money they get on drugs/alcohol, before even food or shelter. 

Some veterans joined the military out of high school, and if you are not in a specialized position in the military or a place of leadership, it can mean that you may not have many skills that are applicable in the job market, a market that more and more favors those with college education.

"DaystromInstitute","t5_2whek","On a sarcastic note, one might ask what impact UFO conspiracy theorists have had on Earth society. Aside from the Heaven's Gate tragedy, very little, and even then, unless one's arguing that one of those tragic souls would have been the next Zefram Cochrane, their deaths were not - in a larger sense - consequential.

On a more practical note, the Prime Directive is not - and cannot be, I argue - a matter of technicalities. You should have to actually show consequences, i.e. demonstrate that *but for* the alleged violation, the society would not have changed. If so, Starfleet might as well not explore any inhabited planet, or get close enough to an inhabited planet in case someone is looking up at the sky at that exact moment. It's always a risk, and if a Captain or a ship steps into that arena, they have to be prepared for that risk and take steps to prevent or mitigate it. 

Consider how we've always seen the Prime Directive and its violations portrayed in the show - it's either blindingly obvious (""The Omega Glory"", ""Bread and Circuses"", ""Patterns of Force"", ""Pen Pals"", ""Who Watches the Watchers"") or arguable to one degree or another (""The Apple"", ""The Return of the Archons"", ""A Private Little War""). In any case, the consequences are apparent and concrete. 

The consequences of spotting an UFO in the sky, in the example you give, are, I submit, hypothetical. It may or may not create a movement of conspiracy theorists, but until one can demonstrably show that it is leading to a significant impact on the development of the society, any violation of the Prime Directive would be - at worst - a very weak one, and likely adjudged to be not worth pursuing.

This is a great pallet to start with because you can go from super natural to full smokey eye.

The pallet brush is good for placing lid color and smudging but is not great for blending. A good blending brush will help with the muddiness you mentioned. 

There's no right or wrong way to wear makeup, and you have to play around to find what works best for you. But I can give you the beginner template that a lot of looks are built off of. Apply light color in inner corner, inner half of lid, and under brow. Apply medium color in crease and outer half of lid. Apply darkest color in crease and outer edge of lid. Darkest color should nestle in medium color. Blend so colors transition smoothly.

&gt;That's *also* something that's at stake, I guess. So yes, that's another way in which this is not a semantic debate.

Well that goes back to the case of metaphysical libertarianism but honestly that raises more questions than it answers because it requires that the events in the brain that lead to the performance of actions do not have an entirely physical explanation, and consequently the world is not closed under physics.

2) Broly (Kale could replace him, but I doubt it, he's too popular)

3) Kafla (we've seen ALOT of her moves, I'm betting her Candy blast is her ultimate)

4) Ribrianne (lol)

5)Jiren (he's simply popular)

6) Toppo (like Kafla, he's shown some of his own moves)

7) SSJ4 Gogeta (we already have 2 versions of a Goku and a Vegeta, let the fusion get some love)

8) Vegito? Omega Shenron maybe? I'm thinking of Anilaza but Anilaza is too big to fit into the screen.

you could say the same thing about the middle class and their car payments and high interest loans. but decisions like these are the reason why people stay poor or stay in the middle class. rather than using that percentage of income to save, invest, build wealth, they spend it elsewhere, on products that are typical of their class. it’s why the suburbs isn’t full of lotto shops, and why the ghetto isn’t full of car lots.

&gt; Removing the stigma for getting help would be beneficial. And before say that therapists would never turn in someone just for thoughts, you’d be wrong.

I referenced this already. If there's an issue with therapists reporting clients for pedophilia, then that's a reason for working to improve confidentiality in therapy sessions. But that doesn't mean we should remove the stigma from society at large.

&gt; And removing the stigma for getting help does NOT mean that you are removing the stigma for child molestation and sexual assault.

I am not conflating removing the stigma against pedophilic desires with removing the stigma against pedophilic actions. I'm saying removing the stigma against pedophilic desires will make it socially acceptable and thus more common. If pedophilic desires is more common, then pedophilic acts be more common as well. Of course, this is making the assumption that if there are more people with a desire to do X, then more people will do X (which seems to be a valid assumption to me).

Additionally, it seems dubious that societal mores are sophisticated enough to differentiate between ""desires to do X"" and ""actually doing X"", but that's a different argument which I'm not making.",1514765267

Canada needs to *team up with* Mexico to have any balance or bargaining power vs the United States, who initiated this whole mess. Otherwise its is guaranteed that each will be picked off one by one by US trade negotiators.

Moreover, Mexico has shown [loyalty to Canada and backed us up at TPP negotiations](http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2017/11/11/justin-trudeau-enrique-pena-nieto-tpp-deal_a_23274383/) when Japan and Australia were trying to railroad us into a bad deal. They didn't have to do that.

Finally, it's pretty well know (but never publicly admitted) that the NAFTA trade negotiations aren't exactly negotiations: they're a shakedown. When the Trump Administration doesn't get what they want (and they won't, their demands are outrageous) the USA will walk away form NAFTA. It's going to happen, Canadian businesses better get ready. So what should Canada do then...leave NAFTA as well? No, it needs to stay in the deal with Mexico, improve it, and even expand it to include other countries (UK, anyone? Latin America?) to help balance our imbalanced trade relationship with the US. 

Canada desperately needs to diversify its trade *away* from the United States: putting all your eggs in one basket is poor economic policy, and poor geopolitical strategy too. As we're now learning. Dumping Mexico when they have been Canada's ally would not only be a dick move but it would be counter-productive to what we need to do.",1514765268

A week or so ago, there was a bump below my jawline. I kept squeezing at the bump (really bad habit of mine), and it didn't go away. Eventually, it started scabbing over with a thin layer of darkened skin, and I thought it was filled with liquid, so I decided to poke it with a detail knife. (This happened yesterday.)

Nothing really came out (minus a small bit of blood) even with more intense squeezing, so I called it a night, got some Neosporin and a bandaid, slapped it on, and went to sleep. This is what it looks like right now. Wat do?

Do I need to go to a dermatologist immediately? Or can it wait? (I'm visiting family in Korea in half a year, and I'm planning on visiting a dermatologist then anyways.)

And finally, will this forever remain an unsightly bump even w/ a visit to the dermatologist?

He said, ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants.""  And it led me down a crazy road where now I am a vegetarian and make almost all my own food.

So if you're looking to learn how to cook I'd be more than willing to chat with you about anything that I happen to be making as well as talk you through any questions you have.  A lot of cooking is just trial and error and once you know the basics it's all easy.  Mostly just timing.  But seriously, youtube is great for cooking tutorials and so many people have blogs where they'll explain things step by step you don't even need to try that hard to learn how to cook.

And I'm also always more than happy to recommend books.  I read pretty much anything so if you tell me what you're into I can always see if I know anything that you may like.

Vs the nurse or huntress, it really relies on line of sight. Line of sight is a harder concept to grasp than ""run to pallet"".  Nurses try calculating their landing spot when they blink. So remember that. Huntress try calculating objects in the way of their hatchet so it connects. Huntresses worry about how tall objects are that survivors can run around, that will block the hatchet.

By late March, Melbourne will be starting to cool down (you might get anything from a 15 degree day to 30 degrees at that time of year.) Sydney is starting to cool down (average mid 20’s through March) &amp; Queensland’s weather is nice &amp; warm year round.

I live in Melbourne, &amp; I consider us a culture, sports &amp; events city, not a pretty things to look at or amazing beaches city. For what you’ve noted &amp; the short duration of your stay, i’d actually skip Melbourne. Just my opinion. If you do end up in Melbourne, round 1 of the AFL season kicks off when you’re in Australia - maybe catch a game if you can.

What I would actually do if I was in your shoes -

Fly into Sydney, check out the bridge, opera house, botanical gardens, Bondi. Stay 1 or 2 nights. Fly Sydney to Byron Bay (you may then wish to spend a night there depending on time of day etc.) I would then drive from Byron to Brisbane - less than 200kms but take a whole day. From here you could either fly up to Cairns or continue to drive up the coast (if you drive then you probably don’t have much time for Cairns &amp; the reef before you have to leave again.) If you fly to Cairns you’ve then got plenty of time for the reef, beaches, exploring more coastline &amp; then you could fly back to Sydney from Cairns or Townsville.

Please bear in mind that domestic flights here are not cheap.

If you end up fitting Melbourne into your itinerary, you might want to consider a day trip to Tasmania (food, wine, wilderness, museums.)

But the purpose of blaming the voters is to get people to realize that we *do* have the power. We need to get out the vote, and we need to vote for the better candidate.

They can make it so that minorities, the working poor, and college students have a harder time voting than old rich white people. And that will certainly stop some of them. But it won't stop all of them. Most of them consciously make the decision to either stay home, or to not vote for the better candidate. And no, shame won't work. (I don't know what will.

I was at school, and the idea of a lot of children in my room didn't really bother me that much since I was like 10 years old myself and they couldn't have been more than 6.

She found one of my boxes with legos in. Usually spare parts I just use to randomly assemble stuff. I was totally okay with letting them use it, albeit I wasn't asked. The only issue I took with the whole thing was that I have some figurines made from LEGO Bionicle which i played with regulairly at the time. What frustrated me was that they had taken those disassembled them and then build them into other things. Luckily I could still rebuild them back to the typical stuff. I told my mom I didn't mind them playing with my LEGO sets as long as actual sets and figurines I build are not touched. She apoligised for it, and promised me she'd tell them next time if they ever came by again.

Nothing big enough to grab between my fingers, but there's quite a few of them. No nipple itching or sensitivity that I can differentiate from normal nipple-activity.

I was thinking of going to get my bloods taken now on week 4, but how much of a waste would that be? Do I still need to re-dial my AI-treatment after week 6? (when supposedly the test have fully saturated my blood)

*Edit - Not really keen on doing bloods on both week 4 and week 6. ",1514765280

"Naturalhair","t5_2t03a","With 6 inches of 4c hair, you are around the point where the only probable way to retain more length is to be consistently and extremely gentle.

For me, gentle meant no more combs, picks or brushes because they always ripped the ends. No more detangling every day either because that is breakage and over time, it hurts progress. Avoiding opportunities for tangles by keeping it braided or twisted 98% of the time and *always* before I lie down or after it gets wet. 

For men, the easiest and most socially conforming way to do this is probably twists or box braids, maybe cornrows. If you use your own hair, make sure to regularly coat the ends in an oil or stretch them around something at night, otherwise they’ll knot around themselves.",1514765280

"comicbooks","t5_2qhon","&gt; Accessibility is definitely an issue, some characters have 75 years of stories behind them and most of them have at least 30. 

Sure, but manga puts out 52 issues per year instead of 12, so like I said, many manga already have more pages to get through than 75 years of comics would produce. Besides, for most of those 75 years, you can read synopsises to get caught up on the major bullet points. It's not like most of the people who have been reading comics over the past few decades started on Action Comics #1, most jumped right into the middle of a storyline without half the resources that a modern reader would have available for catching up. That's not a problem.

&gt;I mean how many threads a week do we get on this sub of people asking about where to start for a certain character, which run to start with or even where to start with DC, Marvel, Image, etc.

Yeah, but again, *that* comes from poor labeling, how a relatively recent series might have 3-5 different ""volume one"" trades that each cover a different year's worth of comics. If they did a better job of labeling so that readers would know exactly where each volume fit, they could pick one and work backwards and forwards from there. The issue isn't that the decades of continuity exists, it's that they aren't well *organized.* ",1514765282

2 of them are story missions that got buffed to be strikes(CoO)    
1 of them is hot garbage (EXoDuS DoWn)       
that leaves 5 or in my case 4 playable strikes    
Arms dealer    
Inverted Spire      
Pyramidion    
and Savathun    
(+ the lake of darkness or whatever which I can't comment on personally)   
  
Out of those 4 My least favorite is Savathun. While it is a fun strike in itself: the writing is abysmal, the boss fight could be better (adding a mechanic to  speed up immune phase), and the pacing is kinda bad.     
  
Next is the Pyramidion: the main fault here is that the taken suck.  
  
Then the Arms dealer : I like this strike except the whole first part of the boss fight (in b4 elevator) is useless just because his gains all of his health again and it doesn't feel like a new phase. It feels like a waste of time. Apart from that it's a great strike.  
  
Lastly in my opinion the best strike of D2, is The inverted Spire. The Phases feel like phases, the boss changes mechanics and it's a nice switch. (Not Just a bullet sponge) The Strike itself is long but for good reason. There is a lot of variety between areas and the environment plays a role during a lot of the strike (Looking at you drill).

"bipolar","t5_2qnv4","Do you have a prescription for this medication that they have access to? If you don’t, it would be pretty difficult for them to access it on the black market. Psych meds aren’t generally available just to be had on the street. 

If they don’t have a way to get them, it’s unlikely they are putting them in your food. 

If they DO have a way to get them, then you can pre-empt that by picking up your own prescriptions and doing what you like with them. 

All of that said, the best course of action here is to talk to your doctor about how this medication makes you feel and see if there is a better alternative. Talking to your doctor is always the best option when it comes to things like this, and possibly your family could be included. It could be dangerous for your family to be drugging you if you were taking your medication as well (meaning you were getting a double dose), or if it interacted with something else. A doctor could explain that to them. 

Good luck. ",1514765283

--Rebuild and recover.

I haven't been around in a while outside the random comment, because quite frankly I haven't had much to say. Waitress broke me into a thousand pieces and told them to fuck off and die on her way out. Then most of my 'family' joined her. Losing that many 20+ year friendships felt like multiple breakups simultaneously. 3 months and still no change. I know I'll never talk to her again, but I just can't get her out of my head. Trying.

I have so much to work on that even trying to date would be foolish in the extreme. So I'm taking the year to work on myself physically and emotionally. I'm getting help starting after new year's. And hopefully, with any of the luck I haven't had, I won't do anything that'll land me in even more trouble.

At some point during my visit, as I gaze out over the landscape, I'm always distracted by screaming and yelling in the distance, where I can see a door or gates that are just in the middle of nowhere, like a door in a field that you could just walk around to see what's on the other side. The yelling and screaming is always a group of people, never more than silhouettes who are in a frenzy, as they flap their arms and legs, ripping at each other but like they can't see, they can't see the other souls in the frenzy with them, they can't see that the door they flail in front of literally leads to nowhere. 
Every time my attention is diverted to these people I get told not to pay too much attention to them as they can suck you into their frenzy. When I express concern for them, I'm always told that they'll soon realise the truth and that it's important they do it on their own. 
I'm not surprised you couldn't find any info on it, I've talked to many psychics and mediums, and none of them have been to the other side that they can remember, nor have they seen the things I've seen.

You make claims without support and then demand that they are denied. 

That is not how life works outside of your social justice bubble.  

I called you out for being a bully, the original poster laughed at you for trying to bully, yet you're still to thick to understand.

You have not offered any evidence that what you claim is true and rest your case on it not being denied.  That is what a child would do. 

You attacked someone personally on the internet because you felt his wife might have been insulted.  Instead of asking about it you insult the guy multiple times and attempt to shame him.

You got called out.  Deal with it.  

lol I know I had an impact because your wife even checked me out.  You spent the last 4 days of the year desperately trying, and failing, to prove you are not a bully.  

Btw this is all reasonable of me.  Apparently if you say something is reasonable you don't need to support it with facts.   Makes sense right?

See if you weren't affected. You would have laughed at me like the guy you insulted laughed at you.  Obviously you feel guilty otherwise you wouldn't still be talking with me or talking about it with your wife. 

Wait a minute?  Did you not see his response!?!  Lmao!  He did deny you!  Oh man this is good.  There goes your whole argument too.

You ration each pen just so others don’t go neglected. You find a great pen in your drawer that doesn’t get touched anymore because you bought the special edition or the next model up. A bronze Homo Sapiens sits in my desk that lots of people would probably love but I just have it to round out my Visconti HS series. A beautiful Pro Gear hasn’t been touched since the Imperial Black version arrived. I bought the new TWSBI 580 in red to match my other LE colors knowing it would never be a daily driver because it has a steel nib. You buy inks because you like the color then realize it’s virtually identical to some of your other bottles you forgot you had. You see a new pen announcement and it starts again. Your wife cries alone in bed while you’re on the computer buying more. Your kids start acting up to get your attention. It doesn’t work. They start spilling ink on purpose. You buy more. You reach for your beer but accidentally take a sip of Kon-Peki. You don’t notice. Your work performance falters. Your parents’ calls go unanswered. Nothing matters anymore.

"contortion","t5_2s7vj","Nice job on the backbends! It looks like you actually have pretty open shoulders which is tough to get. For the splits I’d focus on adding in a couple of more hip flexor stretches (and strengthening exercises) to your warmup/conditioning - looks like your hip flexors are what needs to be loosened up more than your hamstrings. Some of my faves:

LUNGES. If you have a gym or access to dumbbells, GREAT. If not, bodyweight’s OK too (but using dumbbells and doing some legit strength training works better for me). 20 lunges (10 on each side), making sure to keep your tailbone tucked under to feel a stretch in the hip flexor of your back leg. If you’re just doing body weight, an interesting version I learned in a yoga class was step forward into a lunge with a straight back leg, and front knee stacked right over your ankle, then slowly lower the back knee until it’s about an inch over the floor, then straighten that leg. So the only movement should be coming from your back leg, and if you keep your hips tucked under you should feel a bit of a stretch in that back leg hip flexor.

KNEELING HIP FLEXOR STRETCH. Kneel on the floor with one foot out in front on the ground, knee stacked over the ankle, and the other knee directly beneath your hips, with that shin and foot behind you. Tuck your tailbone and press the back shin into the ground to make it more of an active stretch. You should be able to feel a stretch in your hip flexor just doing that. Optional would be to pull the back foot off the ground towards your butt, which will increase the stretch. This one’s also nice to do with that back shin against the wall and you can lean your butt and back against the wall to try and flatten everything out",1514765291

Going to a testing center to pee in the cup is the hassle, not the peeing itself.

&gt;You have a point on it being an invasion of privacy, but again, if you don’t like it you are more than welcome to seek employment elsewhere.
 
You could say this about sexual harassment or a number of issues that could just be a ""nuisance"" at work.

&gt;False positives are rare and if it’s due to a medication you take it is easily clearable.

What if it's not due to medication? I don't really trust some stranger to put my job on the line because of their competence in doing a drug test.

&gt;It’s honestly not that big a deal. Especially if you are not a drug user.

Like I said, I'm not even a drug user. Never have been. I had an addict brother, and because of this I've never smoked, never tried any illegal drugs (including marijuana) and I'm a teetotaler.

Current planning policy means that social housing will be included in the building. You spend a million on your apartment and the family next door gets if for free, does not work and feels the need to treat the whole building like trash.

Spending what is a large part of what you will ever earn to buy an apartment and then hoping that you didn't get the bad ""neighbor"" is ridiculous.


This is why people prefer ""established"" areas, which is code for people who live there actually worked hard to get their house and respect the area and their neighbors.

To be honest, a lot of dublin city centre has been lost to social engineering. But we have way too many SJWs to ever fix it.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I grew up in Cupertino, CA where most people who live here have backgrounds in medicine, engineering, computers, or law and all the houses cost at least 1.2 million+ with an average of 2 million for a 3bed/2ba. I moved to another state for university and I was actually in shock for the first few months. 

1. People didn’t get new cars when they turned 18
2. People only have 1 fridge?! How do they fit everything into that?
3. People have to pay their own phone bills and are not on a plan with their family?
4. People have to pay for their own college education with loans
5. Families had to share cars. In my household we all had our own car and an extra one as the family car.
6. People don’t have their parent’s backup when they are in financial trouble.
7. People have never left the city/state and don’t even own passports
8. Some people don’t even have a drivers license.

It took a long time to adjust to and I never realized before how lucky and spoiled I was. Yes i’ve had a job since I was 16-17 because I didn’t like the idea of asking my parents for money whenever I wanted to do something but no I never had to pay for anything big while growing up. My parents payed for my first new car when I was 18, they payed for my insurance, phone bills, and even my tuition in cash. Only when I turned 22 ish did I start going my own way.",1514765292

It does well f2p and is a huge upgrade compared to the magna variant. If you ever do lucksack a murg then thats even better. I would recommend saving stones for varuna if you want to future proof yourself. 

Lucifer is better taken as a friend summon as your main summon for light is going to be Lumineira and that requires 6 swords minimum for some decent damage. Unless you're going for double Lucifer grid (elemental) which would be 3 magna 3 normal 3 ex 1 mh. But magna would still be better. Stoning Lucifer is good for having a strong stat stick for your grid or for never having to worry about finding a mlb'd friend summon as lumiXchev is the correct grid/summon

Here's my tips:

1. Be born in Texas

2. Live with SO= $500 rent+no roomie drama+homecooked meal everyday


3. Costco membership. I used to be drop $60 every two weeks on regular grocery stores. Got a costo membership on groupon for $60 (comes w 2 cards, you can share with a family member and split costs) that came w $25 store credit, free pizza, free case of vitamin water, and free giant pack of toilet paper. Pays for itself instantly. Now my $60 at costco can actually result in food lasting a month.

4. I do pay all my necessities, excluding rent, on credit card. I mean you're already gonna have to pay for it (gas, food, etc) why not get a little bit of cash back?

Marina Krim, the mother Lulu and Leo arrived home to the horrifying scene of her dead children in their W. 75th St. apartment, with Ortega in the process of slicing her own throat with a kitchen knife. Krim and another daughter had been out at a swim class when her oldest and youngest children were killed.

I had a backpack that was small enough to qualify as a carry on and that was very convenient. Especially since it was about 100 degrees and I walked everywhere. Packing cubes are super helpful!  If there's anything you need that you didn't bring you can get it in Spain.  Try your best to blend in and not look like a lost dazed tourist so you're less of a target for pickpockets. If you need to look at a map, step to the side of a walkway or inside a shop. I liked having a small cross body purse with zippers to keep my stuff in for walking around during the day. It's easy to walk with your hand casually on the strap and not look like you're a paranoid tourist.  I'd advise against money belts. It's inconvenient and makes you stand out like a sore thumb when you dig in there paying for something.  Don't carry a ton of cash on you and I just kept my visa in a hidden zipper inside my purse. When you stop at ATMs do it in a crowded area in the daylight or inside the lobby of a bank.  I usually kept my passport in the safe at my hostel. And when it comes to hostels i didn't realize how much the atmosphere of the hostel added to (or detracted) from my visits to different cities. Try to look at reviews and book ones that look like they provide social activities. You might get lonely and having a place to meet other solo travels will be really awesome if homesickness sets in.  It's a lot easier to feel lonely when you're around a bunch of antisocial people in a boring hostel than when you're out and about doing things. Im not a huge partier but staying at a friendly hostel made a huge difference in my happiness. Also one more thing: make sure you know how to get from the airport to your first destination before you leave (and I'd google street view it to double check the directions)   Don't count on public wifi to work for maps/navigation.  Have the directions you need written down somewhere so if your phone dies you can still get to where you're staying.  My first night in Portugal I got to Porto and took the train into the city planning to follow the hostels directions from the train stop. I got off and the first line was ""walk to the church"". I looked up and there were literally five churches all in different directions. It was 10pm, dark, I had no cell service, and I know zero Portuguese.  I eventually got there but don't let what happened to me happen to you!

The Ballymun Flats refers to a number of flats—including the Ballymun tower blocks, seven landmark residential towers built in the 1960s—in Ballymun, Dublin. In total there were 36 blocks of Ballymun flats (7 fifteen-storey, 19 eight-storey and 10 four-storey blocks). While nothing unusual by global standards, and small compared to Eastern European or Swedish norms, they were experimental for Ireland.

Consistency is something that's relatively easy to achieve for moral codes by iterating exceptions, unless there's a blatant contradiction somewhere fundamental.

Witch a second set of Joycons you have two fully functional wireless controllers with all the bells and whistles. You also have the ability to split them up for up to four players.  There is the hidden cost of another Joycon Grip at some point, but it's still the way to go.

Peake's Perky Chicken

Thursday, December 24, 2015
12:17 PM

Source:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbwIhS2D7D8

Serves:


Notes from video:
Some guy on Reddit made it.
• Cut slits in chicken for marinade to soak in.
• Marinate for 30 mins.
• Put in oven bag in oven.

Ingredients:
1 1/2 lb chicken - boneless chicken thighs
1 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinegar
3 tbsp olive oil
6 smashed garlic cloves
1 1/2 tbsp dijon mustard

Directions:
Mix it all up, wash the chicken, put it in a baking pan, bake for 20 mins

Personal notes:
I bake at 375 for 45mins in glass casserole or metal baking pan, covered in tin foil.

Temp and time is based on Googling for appropriate temps and times for baking dark meat chicken (thighs are dark meat and apparently take longer to cook)

If using chicken thighs with bones, buy extra poundage to account for the bones. It'll fall off the bone after baking.",1514765300

At our level we classroom sets of chrome books, and it sounds like many elementaries do too. But again varies, we have a couple A rated elementaries and it’s clear which kids come from there. 
We also have half days for students every Monday, with rotating PD for teachers. Whole district (you choose a pd), school level, PLC time, or personal work days (2-3 hours to get shit done is the best)

Curriculum leads for the district are new, really cool, and down to earth (I’m very comfortable talking to the secondary level person). And we are getting a new superintendent. Lots of change going on right now. ",1514765301

* Lose another 15lbs. I know I can do this, I just need to be disciplined (and I have not been lately!)

* Save up a deposit for a flat (I don't think I'll manage this in a year, but I can get much closer than I am now).

* Visit at least one country/place I've never been to before.

* Read more books than I did last year (so at least 20).

* Keep writing - I sort of swapped my fiction for a blog, but I'd like to somehow manage to do both. Will be happy if I progress in either, though!

"needforspeed","t5_2s8z6","I know its a false feeling of escaping, but provided you had kept going, it would have made sense. It was only nonsensical in this clip because you slowed down. Yes the cops chases do limit your freedom a lot, but not all plots and gameplay are completely open. The cop chases are a linear plot, and just like any linear plot game, if you don't play it how its intended, it will stop making sense. 

I started playing Payback a week or so ago, and so far I've loved the police chases, and I can see why they have a scripted escape. If they didn't, you would never lose the cops unless you had a super car. The police are super aggressive and quick, which is what makes the chases fun. If you don't like how the police chases end, then that's your opinion and you're entitled to it. I can understand where you are coming from. I personally love them, and never found the scripted escape to be an issue, or burst my bubble when I'm enjoying a police chase. I just use my imagination to explain what the script doesn't, i.e. the remaining cop cars were too damaged to continue, or keep up, or the damage got too much and the cars started failing, or you ducked off the main road when a small gap opened.",1514765305

"Cichlid","t5_2ved3","To answer your questions, your female fish is still probably giving off some egg-producing vibes, so right now all the males (especially if your tank is heavily male) are all going to see if they can get her to breed--or to give up any eggs she might be holding because they aren't theirs.  Turning the lights off will help with aggression, as will lower tank temperatures, and increased feeding will all reduce some of this, but as they start breeding the breeding pressure/aggression is only going to escalate as the fish become more mature.

"nba","t5_2qo4s","It'll be tough though. Lebron's first half of his career was wasted (relatively). Jordan's team was good as fuck and still good without him when he left for that stint. I also wonder how he'd do if he had to face a team like GSW. If Lebron beats this iteration of GSW, he's GOAT for me no question. Lebron has been an underdog in most of his finals iirc (and will be this year if he makes it again) which is insane. He's faced some seriously historically great teams and for 2 of his finals he was very undermanned. The only one he should've won and didn't was 2011 and unfortunately some people never let that go. Was Jordan's team ever the underdog?",1514765306

"AskAcademia","t5_2sakj","Generally speaking, don't go into academia for money, especially in the humanities. 

For your questions:

1. Look up the stipend at some schools you would like to attend. See what your budget would be like.
2. Depends on if you can get travel grants and if the archival research is essential to your project. 
3. How much time and money will you have left after all that travel?
4. In Canada (where I am) the pay for professors is generally good but positions are very few and far between. 

It sounds like you need to get some travelling out of your system before thinking about a PhD.
