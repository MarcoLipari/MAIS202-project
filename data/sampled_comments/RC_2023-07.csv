Tens a almofada mais pequena para dormir e depois a maior para encostar, usas a de encostar. 

Os ruídos da cama é que as vezes é preciso mais tática. Temos uma casa daquelas que abre para arrumar coisas. Cheia de merdas até acima, top, nem mexe, nem chia, nada. 

De férias, as vezes não controlamos o sítio, na maioria das vezes um chinelo de praia bem colocado faz maravilhas",1688169601.0

"summonerschool","t5_2t9x3","The solution to this is just growing more sensitive to when fights truly are going to break out. Imagine you're on the winning team, and you have the following simple scenario: 2 players on your team who are ahead, are looking to fight 3 players on the enemy team who are behind. You have a very straightforward choice-- you can walk to your jungle quadrant with its camps up, or you can join those 2 players on your team. Let's pretend there's no variance, no surprise DC's, no new enemies showing up, etc.

You join your team every time, right? Because the lead you get from winning that fight, the tempo, the control over more resources and objectives, is going to outweigh those 3 camps, which by the way aren't going anywhere-- you can clean them up right after, and then either take an objective or reset or rotate or invade or do whatever you need to do to extend your lead. 

But this isn't how the game works in reality. In reality, it does not subjectively feel like you are offered a multiple choice problem that is very black and white and straightforward, but if feels like something more complex, confusing, uncertain, and you do not really deliberate and think carefully and weigh pros and cons. 

What people do instead is, they default to their own habits and tendencies which are basically rules in their heads that they follow. If they like to farm, then they farm by default. If those 2 players don't massively throw that 2v3 fight, then you get to farm, which is good, and they retain their lead, which is good, and things are net good for your team. But sometimes, those 2 players, die, but you still retain your farm if you autopiloted to clearing-- not as advantageous for you, but still better than a truly worst case scenario where you somehow joined them but you were either late or there was misunderstanding/misplaying, and you all collectively threw together.

The point of all of this is to get you to reflect on your ""rules"" in your head, and try to relax these rules, and look at the game more flexibly-- look at it more like it really is a multiple choice problem to solve. What's the correct move in *this* instance-- farm, or join team? Try to let go of this ""default to farm"" mindset-- because while rules are helpful, rules help you learn the game(Do not take tower shots, walk up for cs, base when you have a lot of gold, shove the wave out before resetting), the hard part of the game is essentially learning when to break and when to follow these rules.",1688169602.0

"AskWomenOver30","t5_2ya5k","Disclaimer: I’m a guy, so this is just one datapoint for a guy who deliberately understates his works:

I’ve been the CEO of a tech company that I cofounded for the last 10 years. The first 2 years it was fun to tell people that I’m an entrepreneur and CEO, I was flying around the world getting my ego stroked. At parties men and women would make a special effort to be around and talk to me.

Then, a few years in, I realized everyone who thought I was cool because I was an entrepreneur disgusted me. I was on the inside, seeing how the sausage is made, and the more I practiced capitalism the more I hated it. The people who gave me unearned admiration started to seem like bootlickers.

Now on my dating profile it just says that I like making things and I have no pics on my profile that would suggest more than a middle class income. If I evaluated my own profile, I’d guess I was making around the median or a bit below for my metro.

Am I worried about gold diggers? No, not in the traditional sense of a pure gold digger. But I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t afraid of a partner deciding “eh, he’s almost good enough on his own, and if I count the career side he makes it across the line.”

Of course money matters to nearly everyone - it’s not wrong of them to factor that in, I don’t blame them. I just have no way to tell if my partner just sees it a nice bonus, or if it’s the critical ingredient making the relationship work in their eyes. That’s scary.

My friends who are entrepreneurs have had similar feelings about sharing their work, and the one who’s dating profile I saw did not mention his work or show lux anything. They also downplay their work to both men and women. When you’re just trying to get to know people, casually swapping tidbits about your lives, etc, saying you have a fancy job can be like dropping a bomb in the conversation. It can make people feel smaller or competitive or like the stakes of the conversation just increased. It never just slides by naturally, it always changes the vibe.",1688169602.0

"Yugioh101","t5_30a9p","If you only play with friends in someones kitchen, find cheap decks that each can win. And if you want to order cards, ask others if they want to order some cards with you. Split the order and you all saved money, got cards and can talk about some card if they seems unfair. Biggest problem comes when one starts investing too much compared to others.

If you plan going to locals, which i reccomend, be friendly to everyone, you will meet a lot of new people and become friends with some of them. Whenever you feel ready, ask them to come and play with you for fun. They will help you grow big time. 

As for deck made for locals, i highly recommend trying it out on simulator like YGO Omega before you buy it. Try out versus other people in casual rooms because that is what you will play against at locals. Buy deck only after you tested the deck and you find it fun but also can win some games. This will save you a LOT of money, at least it made a huge difference for me.

While the team is SLOWLY making progress reconfiguring the roster. It's going on four seasons of these types of issues.

A couple months ago, my wife said she was going out for a ladies' night. She asked me to take care of my son, so I immediately obliged. ""Yes Ma'am,"" I told her. After a while of waiting, she finally left and I could play my favourite game, Among Us. I hopped on my laptop, booted it up and my desktop loaded, complete with the 'Red Sus' background and all my Among Us Impostor fan-art. I was shaking in excitement. I slowly dragged my finger across the track pad, and watched the cursor as it glided over to the Among Us icon. Among Us. My absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well-made game in the entire world. As I clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again. My fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the Innersloth logo faded in, and then out. Then the main title appeared. I immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen. Oh, how I wish I could feel those luscious, soft asscheeks. Pink is my queen. The real woman in my life. My wife could never be as sexy as Pink is; her soft footfalls in electrical as I peek at her curvy form from inside a vent, waiting for the right time to strike. I could never get close to Pink, however, as if she had some kind of sixth sense, she would always leave before I could reveal myself to her as the impostor. I press Practice, to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of Among Us. I hit Blue in Comms, then cross the hall and vent to Specimen, murdering Green in cold blood. The thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush. I then move towards Reactor, stabbing Yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access Decontamination. I move quietly through the halls, like a snake about to strike its prey, and I see- Oh no. It's Pink. Standing there motionlessly as I face her directly. Her visor shows no emotion. But she knows. I can feel it in the air. I can't kill her. She is too beautiful, too angelic, the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit, like stars on a voided sky. She doesn't run. I am moved to tears as I caress the screen, kissing it tenderly. ""Goodbye, Pink. See you soon. It will all be okay,"" I whisper in a soft, reassuring voice. Then as my cursor hovers over the kill button, I hesitate. Thoughts of love go through my head. Red having reddish-pink sus children with Pink. But I have to. As the impostor, it is my duty to kill. I press the 'Kill' button and watch as my character beheads Pink silently. All I hear is the spurt of blood. There is no rush. There is only Red, standing by himself in Fuel. Pink's lifeless body laying on the floor beside him. I feel nothing at first, then immense sadness, like I'm at a loved one's funeral. My son knocks on the door, interrupting my brief moment of mourning. He asks, ""Dad? Are you going to make me a snack?"" I tell him to shut up, and my voice cracks. I break down sobbing. I killed her. I killed my one true love. God, forgive me. I open the door to my son, and he has a confused look on his face. I say nothing, and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich. Tears roll off my face into the bread as I lay it onto the counter. Lettuce, cheese and meat, followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top. My son is quiet. He sits on the couch, and stares at the floor. There is a depressing air around us. I serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room, contemplating life. If I killed Pink, how am I to be trusted around my family? I cry for hours, and finally my wife comes back. She sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream. She then asks me why I'm crying and mutter, ""I killed her. I killed my only love, Pink, in Among Us."" She is filled with rage and slaps me across my face. I feel numb. She asks for a divorce. I don't reply. Instead, I take my laptop and get into my car, driving to a nearby hotel. Fast forward a few months to the divorce. It was quick and painless. After court, I ask my former wife to take me back.

""I can't take you back. You've always been this way. I was sus of you from the start.""",1688169603.0

They sedated him, but didn’t give him anesthesia. I forgot the pill but it was very light and used for travelling with animals. Their staff were extremely caring, patient, and loving to him. A few months after his cleaning he had his annual vet checkup and my vet of 4 years said they did a fantastic job. 

I’d pay the money again. And no offense, but I’m 100% going to take the advice of my cat’s lifelong vet over a stranger on Reddit. I’ll never put my cat under anesthesia if I don’t have to. True Anesthesia can have complications even on the first time. I’d happily spend a few hundred bucks more than put my boy through that chance.

She says “I could feel you move!” “Oh really? I’ve heard some people felt no movement at all. Have you seen that show I didn’t know I was pregnant? Crazy stuff.” 

If she goes on about when you meet a good man.. “When did you meet (current partner)?” 

You can subtly change subjects. 

If she goes on about wanting to be a grandma. “Yunno we should really call grandma. It’s been awhile since we’ve seen her.” 

If she says babies are miracles.. “speaking of miracles did you hear that story about the dog that dialed 911??” 

Or you can make jokes.. 

Babies are miracles! “Thank you for noticing I’m a miracle. I always knew I was great but it’s good to know you think so too!”

Sometimes the left fullback might be playing the role of an attacking midfielder, sometimes both 8s overload one side of the pitch (something that caused Beale problems last season), sometimes you'll see the holding midfielder out wide etc.

It's positional play at its very best. It just takes a bit of time for the players to learn it all. And defensively it can leave you a bit open however it's a trade off for the amount of chances you can create. (Celtic were actually quite good defensively, in 21/22, Celtic had a lower xG conceded per game then Rangers did when they only conceded 13 goals)",1688169604.0

Yesterday, my daughter woke up around 4am whining and looking through the crib. I put my hand in the crib and pat her head like I'm there, gimme 2 seconds to wake up, get up and pick you up. And boom she put herself back to sleep, I still can't believe it.

"nrl","t5_2qn90","Honestly the past 2 years has really shown in full contrast the greatness of Cameron Smith and will go down as the best general the game has ever seen in. 

Everything about him was methodical from how he played, prepared and lead, and how he spoke to the refs everything he did was to get gain a competitive edge. 

last year I was listening to the captains run with Kempy and Cam they were interviewing Bellamy. I found it odd how Bellamy was reminiscing the past like a grandmother who hasn't seen his grandson in years. he has never carried on about the past like that before, as much as he won't say it, but you could just tell Cam Smith was his favourite player to coach.

Since that interview I've been rather suspect that maybe it was the end of the storm era and its looking more like that with every passing week.

"conlangs","t5_2red7","> In an AMA, Peterson stated that the preservation of Arabic so far in the future was unrealistic. This [...] doesn't make sense in the context of the films [...] The films also use modern English & Mandarin (latter a big part of ads for the 1st film RE Yueh). There are also bagpipes which somehow represented the Atreides... even though... would bagpipes survive 20K yrs into the future? So English & Mandarin are OK... but not Arabic?

Wrong and irrelevant. English is used because of the translation convention, it's just assumed that the language most of the characters speak, Galach, is translated into English (or whatever the movie was dubbed into) for the audience's convenience, nobody in Dune actually speaks English. As for the use of Mandarin, Peterson had no involvement in this decision since it's not a conlang, and he probably didn't even know about it until the movie's release. Yes, it is unrealistic and illogical, but it doesn't undermine his argument, which is perfectly valid: words staying almost identical for dozens of millennia doesn't make sense.

It's true that the movies erase quite a few elements related to Islam and the Arab world, presumably for a large number of reasons like marketability, perhaps Peterson was asked not to make something too close to Arabic.",1688169605.0

CFMAP Chat: [password: canada](https://health.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/environmental-workplace-health/occupational-health-safety/employee-assistance-services/contact-us/chat-step-1-3.html), Monday to Friday, from 8 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. (Eastern time)

This story is eerily similar to mine, it hits home hard. I graduated RMC in the past few years and this article brought me right back. I don't want to interject/overshadow my experience into this tragedy, but I think it's important to see how common it can be. 

I'm also an immigrant of south-Asian decent that moved to Canada at a very young age. The pressure from family to do well in school and go to a prestigious university was immense. I did well in high school, but not well enough to get into the top Engineering program my parents wanted me to go to. So I chose RMC as my next option. It would get me away from my parents and also held the ""prestigious"" title, which made my parents proud. 

I had no idea what I signed up for. I grew up like a lot of south-Asian immigrant kids; study study study study. No sports, no extra-curriculars, no spending nights at friends. Just study. So when I got to RMC, the combination of school, athletics, extra-curriculars, and being in an extremely competitive environment was overwhelming. I couldn't keep up because I never had to before. 

It really did feel like my self worth and how others perceived me at RMC was directly correlated to my academic and physical performance. I became outwardly very confident to match the personalities around me. But inside I was insecure as ever. I felt extremely lonely and was depressed as ever. I ended up failing 3 classes in my first year. The article mentions OCdt Absar was going on LWOP (leave without pay). This is most likely because he failed key classes and had to repeat them the next year. I know this because I had to do the same. Repeating a year brings on immense shame. You're alienated from your original class year and get looked at like a failure... a loser. RMC isn't well prepped to handle people that are struggling and/or do not follow the cookie-cutter version of the officer they expect you to be. 

Like a lot of south-Asians immigrants, failing at school is like failing your family. It really felt like the end of the world since that is all our parents expect from us... For me, I didn't tell my parents I failed. I kept the lie up that I was doing well. I suspect it was a similar story for OCdt Absar... that's why his parents thought he was doing well and happy. But deep down he was struggling.

During my 2nd year at RMC (while on LWOP), I was about to fail another class. One night before an important midterm I decided I would kill myself. I left the dorms at 10PM to find a tall building to jump from. Luckily I didn't go through with it. I ended up walking to the Airport (13kms LOL) and taking the first flight home so I could tell my parents I'm a failure. Eventually I picked myself up, failed some more, but I got through RMC and am doing very well in my current posting. During my RMC years I would have never believed I'd make it out and amount to anything outside... but that's what RMC teaches you, a good leader is smart, athletic, hard, disciplined... but nowhere is the important of empathy, people skills, and compassion every emphasized. 

If anyone is going through something similar, please please please reach out. There are always options to life, especially when you're that young. RMC is a small place, if you recognize who I am through this story, I kindly ask you keep it to yourself.",1688169605.0

If your car has a dent, how do you fix it short of completely replacing your bumper? Well, you bang it back in place — push in the opposite direction until it's straightened out. Paint it over, good as new (Note: This isn't actual advice, take your car to a professional, you could make the damage worse if you mess up.)

That said, the whole thing is complicated, as with most issues in politics. For instance: when do we know the issue is fixed so we can stop this unequal treatment? Outside of vague answers that vary from person to person, we don't know. The goal is nebulous at best, and could arguably be taken too far if care isn't taken.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Funnily enough, that was related to the same type of thing: his main ""objection"" was the military paying for people to travel to a different state if they needed reproductive care that was illegal in whatever shithole they were stationed in. I actually know people who were part of that holdup; technically selected for promotion back in December but not notified until just recently because it's not official until the Senate approves it.

edit: That said, at least in the type of situations I'm aware of, this did not actually lead to any positions going unfilled. We have an ""up one down one"" rule which means, for example, that a major can fill a lieutenant colonel spot if needed. It could have caused some issues for some spots that really are rank-specific but overall probably did not lead to too many assignments getting held up, it mostly just hurt and inconvenienced individual servicemembers by holding up their raise. (google military pay charts, which are all public, and you can see how much money people might have been missing out on) That level of impact pretty much tracks as far as braindead GOP shenanigans go: hurt individuals because why not.

It also has the benefit of having better strength as you age so less chance of injury and falling. And denser bones. To many ands but and more strength to do anything in life and not be hurt or incapable. Also work mobility. Please don’t just run. Good work, but I would get your body fat tested to actually determine how much muscle you have and could have lost on the weight loss journey. Muscle is only 700 Kcals to get rid of compared to fat, which is 3500 Kcals. And you were not lifting and it does not sound like you lift in general so your muscle tissue could be even less now, reducing metabolism among others things I have typed out.

Why is it absurd? Do you think the government is just too pure to not take advantage of Covid like this? 



Don’t argue why it’s wrong, argue why it’s absolutely absurd to think so. 

>The vaccines intended purpose was to diminish the outcomes of covid. You’re ascribing a lot of intent towards policies that were designed to reduce the impact of covid and misplacing it as “controlling the masses”. It is extremely far-fetched. 

Tell me why it’s far-fetched. Not the actual reason for the vaccine. 

>It’s pretty plain to see that you’re looking for reasons why the covid vaccine was bad for society rather than trying to take an objective view 

You see, I don’t think the Covid vaccine was bad. I think it needs to be administered to the people of whom Covid affects, but there’s no need for everyone else to risk taking the vaccine when it has potential long term effects. 

>on the outcomes of governmental policy and the implementation and deployment of the covid vaccine in response to covid.

I think I’m the only one of us taking an objective view. I look at the economic catastrophe resulted from the lockdowns and think “hey, maybe we should’ve thought about it more”. Furthermore, I don’t believe that forcing people to take a vaccine when they aren’t at risk is a good idea either.

Please, explain why I belong in an asylum because of this.",1688169608.0

"Professors","t5_2svhp","> Do you have any policies regarding ""Academic Dishonesty"" or ""Plagiarism"" in your syllabus?

Nope, but the school certainly does.

But yes, I am very clear about this with undergraduate students, but never have issues with the MS in Data Science students. Usually these professional DS students don;t respond the the authoritarian way I need to start off my undergrad classes, they are professionals and push back. 

But this student is actually quite young, and I don't know their story except that I looked at their LinkedIn profile when the class started, and I began to notice their weird homework assignments and noticed they already listed all the skills I teach in the class as their areas of expertise although they demonstrated they can do none of them.

Now, I don't fault people for inflating their resumes, my class is about Data Science not resume preparation, but it's an interesting note in retrospect.",1688169610.0

"AskMenOver30","t5_2y9pw","I have an ongoing relationship close to 15 years. My wife does not work in education, but due to her mental issues she is usually unavailable for support. She has fought some hard battles over the years and I was always there for her. 

After a couple of tough times I had to fend by myself, I am seriously considering whether this is all worth it. When her weights are too heavy, I help her carry them. When my weights are too heavy, she does not have extra strength to help me. So, if I'll have to deal with my own stuff by my own since she can never lend a hand, what does she bring my life anyway? 

I provide her support; she has acknowledged she knows she can lean on me as needed. I've told her I don't feel the same way.

However, I have this hard thing now because it is a long marriage and it involves a kid. 

If your needs are not being met, state it clearly - it seems you have done this. She told you she cannot fulfill these needs. She was honest and told you in clear terms.

Now it's up to you yo decide how to act. Is this OK for you? Is this enough? When you are 60 and looking back at your life, would you like how you lived? If one of your best friends was in this situation, what advice would you give him?

You can accept - but if you do, you don't get to blame her as she was honest with you. You can tell her that is not enough for you; and as this point either you both realize this won't work or she decides she can change.

However do not think that things will change. Either accept the relationship as is right now, or make things clear.

In the past, I made my choice. I might be thinking about changing the choice now; I thought my wife would get better and be able to support me. I thought I'd be strong and not need support. It feels lonely though and I have a bigger mess because it is a longer relationship with children. 

BTW, I'd suggest getting away from the 20%/80% mentality. A marriage needs 100%/100%, everyday. If one of the sides is lacking it will build resentment over time. And of course your 100% can be a bit different everyday - some days you are more tired, some days you are more energetic. However both must strive to give the relationship 100% of them every day.",1688169610.0

It's expensively costed so seems like a control tool for me. Let's hope it gets adequate control abilities. If the abilities are good then triggering 'on hero attack' could be really good. That's two abilities when you summon it compared to most other titans getting killed the turn they come out.

However the ability being random concerns me on how useful the abilities actually are. They wouldn't give you something crazy triggering randomly, or 'give your hero +10 attack' (since you already attacked to trigger), or something that could destroy your titan... Right? It's all but guaranteed one of the options is a pittance of armor.

The pro though is the two semesters of student teaching you see the ins and outs of a full school year compared to other programs like Long Beach where you student teach for one semester. Everyone from my cohort said that was really beneficial, we gained confidence with the classroom and running it. 


Also a bunch of districts in the oc like to hire csuf alumni or keep it within the district (student teaching for them so you’re more likely to get a job if there is an opening) 

I recommend you look into school districts that offer internships (you get paid while student teaching!) it’s not impossible but probably difficult to find. 

But if you cannot find one get your subbing credential right away! Before the start of the credential program so you can sub for your master teacher (it reeeeeally sucks when you’re teaching the class while a sub gets to sit there and get paid for that or you can also sub on Fridays (first semester we aren’t required to go) 

I would just stick with it, other programs also ask for pre req courses. In the end it’s definitely worth it, I finally saw the “light at the end of the tunnel” 

Best of luck!

Edit: sorry I blab a lot! But during the job interviews I felt really prepared without doing mock interviews because the program has prepared you for that through the edsc courses and student teaching for a full year. You’re running the classroom second semester so you can draw upon all of your experiences when you interview.",1688169612.0

"ConvertingtoJudaism","t5_3xuop4","This is so, so normal. We sometimes think of observance as a straight line from “less observant” to “more observant,” but in truth, it’s more like a bunch of wiggly branches where we might be better at taking on some mitzvot than others, and sometimes we end up less observant in ways than we used to be. _No one_ is perfectly observant, and the realities of the world around us sometimes set us back.

For a very, very, very long time, I was hesitant about taking the next steps to my conversion because I felt I just wasn’t observant enough. I went through many waves of observance, and I was constantly worried that I just lacked the dedication that would be necessary to convert. And then when I did my beit din, after they’d talked to me for a while, they asked me what it was like living in a community where most people are much less observant than I am. And I was like—wait, they are?? 

But somewhere along the way, I had, indeed, become an observant Jew. Not a perfectly observant one, but an observant Jew nonetheless. That’s also how I knew I was ready for the mikveh; I wasn’t perfectly doing all the mitzvot, but I was willing to dedicate my life to trying to get a little better at them, more and more—which also meant accepting that setbacks are part of the process.

Keep going to shul. Try to get to know the people there better. The more you do, the more you’ll notice how even the people you thought of as highly observant are less observant to some mitzvot than you realized. I know meeting people is scary, especially if you’re feeling Not Enough, but it really is the best way to feel less alone. Sit with strangers at kiddush, ask them if they’re reading anything interesting, ask them if they have/want pets. Ask them about their plans for Shabbat—sooner or later, someone will tell you they’re going to a sports bar.

Be gentle with yourself, and just take it one day at a time. Find one particular mitzvah that you want to reconnect with, or a new one you’d like to try. And consider bringing it up with your rabbi. Like I said, what you’re experiencing is normal, and a good rabbi will have seen it many, many times before. They can help you figure out how to reconnect when you’re feeling distant.",1688169614.0

I keep hearing popping noises in my sinuses and I even sound congested according to my friends. I went to an ENT a week ago and the ENT tried chalking it up to allergies. He was super dismissive of my symptoms. I decided to go to another ENT for a second opinion and he noted a deviated septum, persistent discharge, nasal congestion and constant facial pressure even after multiple rounds of antibiotics, and post nasal drip.

"TransLater","t5_37a7m","Hey brother, I hear you. I knew that I was trans in my teens, in the 1980's. Do I regret not transitioning then? I mean, it is such a Sophie's choice. By not transitioning back then, I was able to work hard and gain some financial stability. But at the same time, living with untreated dysphoria robbed me of all joy in life and drove me to alcoholism. On the other hand, if I had transitioned back then I might have found joy in authenticity but would probably have struggled financially, and could have ended up in sex work and addiction as so many of us did.

So my recommendation might be to choose safety and stability for now, but come up with a plan to be yourself as soon as it is feasible. And meanwhile, find community.",1688169616.0
"panicdisorder","t5_2xe3j","They key is to try and lessen your fear of death by 1 accepting that death is inevitable and 2 understanding your body. Our body has many functions that it goes through every day all day long so it’s inevitable that sometimes it’s going to malfunction or shut down with us being sick or having aches and pains and these are completely totally normal. I think that you know that these things are normal but you’re listening to your anxious brain and our rational thoughts. The key is that you can’t let these thoughts win, you have to challenge them. If a stomach ache or a pain in our body meant we were doing die everyone would have very short lifespans.. but that is not the case. You really have to challenge those thoughts that are trying to convince you otherwise because they are lying.",1688169616.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","okay, let me start by saying i totally understand what you’re saying and i have had similar thoughts. What helped me is to think of gender the way i think of culture: it’s man-made and fluid. For example, one can feel uncomfortable with the culture of their birthplace and more comfortable identifying as the culture of something else. I am the child of Greek immigrants but I was born and raised in Quebec, Canada. I can be fluid in my cultural identity and can exist as any of the cultures to which I have been exposed. I can be English-Canadian, French-Canadian, and Greek-Canadian, and even as a Greek loving abroad  ( even though I don’t even have Greek citizenship). As I’ve grown older, I can say that I wouldn’t blame anyone if they, from the list of things to which they’ve been exposed, chooses to identify with the one that makes them feel most whole, most complete. Culture isn’t biological and neither is gender. Anyway, that’s what helped me wrap my Gen-X head around it.",1688169616.0

"CanadianInvestor","t5_347i1","Too few equities might be more risky. Remember the most insidious enemy of long-lived retirees: inflation.

If you retire at 65, you and your spouse are statistically likely to make it to 95. That's at least thirty years you're going to need to fund. At the start of your retirement, you might be able to go to McDonalds for $10, but by the end it could cost as much as $22 (if inflation is tightly controlled) or more if you live longer!

Your money will need to grow if you want to be able to enjoy a comparable quality of life as what you start with. Something like a 60/40 stock/bond mix has better odds of funding a decent, sustainable retirement than 100/0 or 0/100.

Another alternatively would be to tilt even more to equities but have a couple years worth of expenses in a GIC ladder. That way when the market tanks, you won't have to sell to fund retirement expenses and can just use your GICs. When the market recovers, sell then and rebuild your GICs.",1688169617.0

"FFXVI","t5_2wbh2","I think you're probably right, she was just a character that I didn't want her to be. For someone who wanted to atone, she was so *passive* and like I get the desire to atone for your sins, but I feel like she was just kinda waiting for the opportunities to fall into her lap rather than getting out there and doing it herself.

What I don't understand about her arc was if she was going to be forced to kill either way, why wouldn't she just kill the Ironblood herself years ago? I don't remember if they specifically talked about that, if they did then I definitely missed it. But it makes a lot more sense to kill the ones who enslaved and abused your people rather than the ones they're pointing their fingers at. She could still feel like a monster for having done so, but I think it's a more complex and compelling idea to feel remorse for having killed your actual enemies rather than just killing your enemy's enemies.

I confess the growth you mention flew right over my head, and to a fair degree, that concerns me because I grew up gay in a Southern Baptist household. Constantly being told that being gay is an abomination, that there's no room for gay people in this world, etc etc and it took me *decades* to get over that, to find my own self love and self worth. And I had to work *hard* to achieve that. None of that growth resonated in me when I watched Jill's journey. Maybe the circumstances between our situations were just too different, I've no idea, but I didn't really see it. 

The part in act 3 I was talking about was immediately after Cid died. They were in Dhalmek, walking into Hugo's trap to save the Bearers, and when they spat at his feet and told him they should have left them alone. Clive said something along the lines of ""They'll change their minds eventually"" and Jill only replied with ""If you say so...""",1688169617.0

"DebateVaccines","t5_3jwf7",">How do you know it was they were vulnerable desths? You don't even know if they were vaccinated. Again, you're inventing facts to fit your erroneous beliefs about the shots.

The authors control for age, so vulnerable deaths would be those that occur among the elderly. I do, however, grant that this doesn't explicitly account for other dimensions of health (e.g. obesity). I also grant that the vaccination status of the individuals isn't observed. Completely fair issues to raise.  

>Or the Democrats didn't use healthcare post-vax because the vulnerable among them died, leaving the more healtby people who were less likely to be hospitalized and die post-vax. No matter how you try to twist things, you can't get around those pesky confounding variables.

It seems like your argument is akin to the following: 

>Prior to the vaccine rollout, two things were true:   
>  
>1. Unhealthy Democrats were *more likely* to die than unhealthy Republicans.   
>  
>2. Healthy Democrats were *less likely* to die than healthy Republicans.   
>  
>These two effects cancelled out, yielding roughly equal excess deaths for Democrats and Republicans in the pre-vaccine period.   
>  
>But because the excess deaths among Democrats were initially more concentrated among the unhealthy, the population of Democrats alive during the vaccine rollout was healthier than the population of Republicans alive during the vaccine rollout. Thus, we see higher excess deaths among Republicans during the vaccine rollout. 

If I've interpreted your argument correctly, then this is a hypothesis consistent with the observed data. However, my priors are against such an explanation because of the assumptions that would be required to stake the claim. 

One would have to explain what mechanism leads to higher excess deaths among *unhealthy* Democrats and lower excess deaths among *healthy* Democrats such that excess deaths among Democrats and Republicans are equivalent ***only*** for the year of the pandemic prior to vaccine rollout, but not for the year of the pandemic following vaccine rollout. 

Perhaps it's just a lack of imagination on my part, but I find it difficult to think of what mechanism meets these criteria.",1688169618.0

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

Putting them in bigger pots is a good start. 
Pots with reservoirs and good drainage are a good way to go for patio plants.
Getting them into shade during the heat too. There is shade cloth or outdoor cloth you could get and set up with a staple gun/zip ties/thumb tacks. 

Joanns has coupons all the time on their website and outdoors type cloth. Of course there are garden stores too….

There are those pot irrigators-I think sometimes they’re made of glass. You fill with water and you turn them over, put in the soil, and it will slowly drip water by the roots. 

General rule is to water young plants until they are established. Then one can cut back but if you see the plants struggling after additional watering then they need shade and possibly bigger pots.",1688169619.0

Update: The first direction here is the route we took. We have removed the carpet, and the carpet pad, have sprayed the entire area with mold  and have been using dehumidifier and fans all day. 

So far, this seems to be working very well. Not sure if any of the base boards or carpet will be salvageable. But from my untrained eye, it seems like the drywall is safe and dry. 

FWIW: I decide to do this myself for two reason. The remediation companies are all booking several days out. And, we had a very helpful insurance field adjuster/inspector that let us know that these companies charge outrageous prices for work that is very doable for most semi-handy folks.

2. Kikuyu are not similar to tutsi they are similar to other bantu speakers in their region. The Kikuyu were absorbed by later populations, not the other way around.   
3. The Bantu migration theory is well documented and very serious, stop the cap I don't care if you don't believe it.

Sure enough, a few minutes later, a woman that lived nearby who sometimes attended our ward and had a son around my age pulled up and asked if I needed a ride home. 

I still don't know how or why she came back around that long  after school got out, but to me it was a sign that someone up there heard me and was looking out for me. It's an experience that has stuck with me for a very long time and was the foundation of my ""testimony"" for pretty much my entire time in the church.

Personally I loved the first half as much as the second half. It's funny, charming, and entertaining. It starts you off in a false sense of security, thinking ""Oh it's going to be a cute rom-com Freaky Friday."" Then BOOM the drama and confusion hits and suddenly you're on this wild emotional roller coaster. And because it starts off so light-hearted and innocently, it's able to subtly plant a bunch of seeds and hints, little things that don't make perfect sense but you don't think too hard about because this is just a cute rom-com right? But no it's actually plot-relevant and foreshadowing and all that. Haha. Good stuff.

In a way it also portrays the experience of the characters themselves. Because things are so light and breezy, until suddenly they're not.

You've also got to consider that a big reason the second half makes such a big impact is due to this intense contrast between the first half and second half. Shadows are darker because of the light, the light is brighter because of the shadow. That kind of stuff. It strikes a good balance imo.",1688169622.0

"Cloud","t5_2qznf","This is a very broad and complicated topic. In general you need to understand application, database, and network security. Each of these have dozens of sub-branches of related concerns. This is going to seem overwhelming and it should be. My goal is to just give you a fire hose of topics to start researching. You'll find your way from there.

First, I would look into studying the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/#). Learning about these can lead you down a myriad of paths related to security so start here.

You can also check out /r/Netsec subreddit and their [quickstart guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/netsec/wiki/start.

If you're looking at Azure as a cloud provider (God bless you, I'm sorry) you can specifically learn Azure security. Specifically Azure Active Directory (AAD), the Microsoft Identity Platform, Azure RBAC, managed identities, service principals, app registrations...the list goes on.

If you're looking at AWS, you'll need to learn AWS Users, Roles, Groups, Access Policies, Trust Policies, Cognito, etc. It's much more straight forward than Azure.

You can look at learning things like OAuth, Open ID, and the JWT ecosystem in terms of specific technical implementations.

If you need to know specifics about encryption and identity you will need to know Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificates. More generally you should learn the difference between *asymmetric* cryptography and *symmetric* cryptography. If you want more specifics around cryptography you will want to learn about how RSA and ECC work.

If you're want to learn more about organizational governance and security you'll need to research things like SOC2, GDPR, PCI, DSS, ISO 9001, ISO 27001, etc.

If you're looking at IoT specific cloud based security you can look at something like the [IoT Security Foundation](https://iotsecurityfoundation.org/).

I'm sure I'm missing a ton of things but this should get you started.

Good luck!",1688169624.0

Also, while people disliking other people for their religion or race or some other personal unchangeable aspect is unfortunate, it is a fact that some people feel that way about other people. People should only be forced to tolerate other people, not agree with them or support them. For example, a doctor should have to do heart surgery for gay man, but they shouldn’t be forced to help with a trans person’s gender reassignment surgery. One of the best thing about countries like the US is that, as long as you aren’t violent against others or verbally or emotionally harassing people while unprovoked, you can technically hate everyone and have no consequences. Being able to hate people or ideas or other societal aspects without consequences is a very important aspect of society that shouldn’t be downplayed.",1688169624.0

"kingsnakes","t5_3h2fn","Ya 10-12 months is probably about right, this year’s eggs are already in incubation and will be hatching in the next month or two, so chances are it’s last year’s clutch. So this is they way I look at it, out in Nature, small snakes are on just about everything’s lunch menu, so they are programmed to run, hide, and fight as a last resort. So chances are they aren’t just going to come to you, if you’re going to wait for that, you’ll never hold your snake. So generally when they are right about this age is when I really start working with them, just confidently reach in and scoop them out, I’ve found that is probably the most important part, being confident in reaching in, because if you are all scared and hesitant, that gives the snake a chance to run and hide again, and pretty quickly the snake gets worked up, because in its mind, you’re trying to catch and eat it, the more worked up they are the harder they are to handle and the more likely they are to bite, musk and poop on you, and the longer they take to calm down. I also keep a warm washcloth close at hand, because if they do poop on or musk on you, or bite you for that matter, you don’t want put them back right away, that’s reinforcing the behaviour gets them what they want, which is to be left alone, so they will do it more and it’s harder to break them of it. Ya just reach in and grab him out, walk them along your hands for a minute and usually they will calm down, that’s when they will usually wrap their tail around your hand or fingers to get a better grip, their movements will slow and not be so jerky, it just takes time for them to realise you aren’t going to hurt them.",1688169624.0

Deinonychus was actually one of the most important dinosaur discoveries because the deinonychus actually caused the Dinosaur Renaissance. It is because of deinonychus that many people now believe that dinosaurs were warm-blooded animals, and that people do not see all dinosaurs as big, sluggish, slow-moving lizards, but rather as swift and agile creatures.

Hurricane matters more frequently for Ashe and on-hit champs since it applies said on-hit effects at 100% strength. This can be a pretty huge deal when it comes to lifestealing back up. Additionally being able to slow 3 melee champs could effectively cripple the enemy comp.

"reactivedogs","t5_3jbj2","Thank you for posting this. Collar/harness slips happen, even to trainers. My most recent collar slip was with my non reactive younger dog while I worked a renfaire. He slipped a double lead harness and chased a literal herd of  ponies, the guy who wrangles the ponies also had a puppy in the puppy/beginners and beginners+ class I put on for the other workers at the faire. I'm lucky that my pup didn't take a kick, and had it been my reactive senior? I don't know that he'd have been spry enough to not get kicked, and at 45 pounds soaking wet? that pony would have seriously damaged him. 

I think that unless someone is doing something they know will put their dog over threshold, we should give them grace as you've said. I've dealt with all types of people on the other end of the leash when it comes to reactive dogs, and honestly the ones I don't have sympathy or grace for are the ones like a client I just had to fire a month or so ago. She continued to take her very dog reactive 150lb mastiff mix to an off leash dog park and refused to muzzle train. This dog had level 5 bites on two different dogs, and on one of the owners of one of the dogs. I don't have a lot of patience or grace when they don't take their dog's reactivity seriously.",1688169625.0

Masturbation in semi-private settings like bathrooms or your car in a not-too-crowded area so you can drive away if you think you're spotted.

If you're with a guy, let him cum somewhere on/in you and then not clean it up and go to public/semi-public places.

I know some people here might call you crazy, but if your son is 21 (an adult), has a six-figure job, and owns his own house, and still listens to you and lets you police who he dates, I personally feel no sympathy for him. When I was that age, I also had my own apartment and a well-paying job, so if my mom or dad told me what to do and who to date, I would honestly break down laughing.

&#x200B;

>There was a post here where a 19 year old was dating a much older man are yall were telling her to break up with him, he deserves to die and were saying the mom was bad for letting it happen.

21 is seen more of an adult than a 19 year old and it was the 19 year old asking for advice not someone else trying to make a decision for her. I would tell her to break up with him too however if it was someone else (and if she had her own job and place to live) I would probably say to let it run it's course.

"Emory","t5_2rscc","So for training I lift 6 days a week with 3 of those days being dedicated lower body. Right now we are placing more emphasis on my quads and hamstrings over my glutes to build mass and balance everything out. My upper body split is heavily biased towards what I need to work on. My lifts are all 4-6 exercises, 2 warm up sets, 2 sets to failure (and I mean real failure). I do 30 minutes of cardio a day for health and that’s the only part of my training that changes. Increases in cuts lol. 

Diet depends on what phase I’m in. I’ve been mostly massing this last year. I’m not enhanced so this is really important to make me even somewhat competitive at anything other than a local show. Protein is always high, fat and carbs aren’t far behind. I really prioritize Whole Foods in general. Average meal is beef or liver or salmon with rice or potatoes and eggs. In cutting phases I stay away from powders and bars because it doesn’t sit well digestion wise and imo makes me hungrier. I usually slash calories a lot in a cut because I’d rather diet for less time. For actual preps though protocol might be slower but that’s because getting stage lean is different than normal lean. 

I won’t share exact protocol bc it’s super specific to me. What I will say is that if you focus on training with intensity and prioritize nutrition and recovery most people can do amazing things when dialed in.",1688169626.0

So, I decided to get him to stand on his own and took my finger out of his hand. His older brother was standing solo for short periods of time for DAYS before taking his first steps, so I wasn't expecting the little shit to actually take 3 steps towards me. My sister (his mother) was in the other room. She came in when I called her and we spent the next hour having him walk back and forth between us. She wasn't the slightest bit upset that she missed those first 3 steps. 

Also, how many babysitters/daycare workers end up being the ones to see their charges' first steps/hear their first words?

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

I’ve spent far more time at BJJ than I ever did at TKD and I’m a blue belt. MMA isn’t a style, because everyone in MMA has a vastly different style. MMA is basically exactly what you’re describing you wish it was, it’s possible you had a bad MMA experience but there’s isn’t nor should there be an MMA curriculum. I don’t think that it can be successfully argued that “knowing a good amount of an art” by itself will make you a “better fighter” than MMA, otherwise people would just do that, and be successful in that route, but they aren’t. Even the best specialists cross train in other arts because there isn’t one art that’s actually going to train you in every area you need. If there was, MMA wouldn’t exist.",1688169627.0

* Please take a moment to **review the sub rules**. Ignorance is not an excuse for rule breaking.

* All your prices should include the shipping costs, unless international shipping is requested by the buyer. 
* Please **DO NOT** remove prices after an item is sold. Prices MUST stay on the post. Please wrap the item in `~~` characters to ~~strike through~~ the text instead.
* Any ""Want to Buy"" threads should use the weekly stickied ""WTB"" thread.  
* If you're looking for a Price Check, please use the stickied ""Still Available / Price Check"" thread.  
* If you're looking to sell EDC gear, that's fine to do here as long as there are more knives in your post than gear in both value and number. Please consider using r/edcexchange as well.

Természetesen utána fickónak áll feljebb, hogy nem akarja, hogy a lánya mellett üljek, mert maszkban vagyok.

SII has better video assist items for sure though and ibis is superior in the lumix.  Fuji focus racking really needs work, autofocus itself isnt bad, but it's the sudden jumps that makes it look bad/not smooth.  Lumix also loses PDAF in FHD60p and higher, for some reason so keep that in mind if you shoot FHD.

The xh2s is also better at photos, in general, though I do like the FF look.

I use the main Reddit app. The ads aren't a big deal at all. Hardly invasive and I don't even notice them half the time, unlike say.. YouTube.

As for the mods, big deal. If they need new tools, I'm sure Reddit will add them on their official app. They have a business to run so they aren't going to just sit there and do nothing. Tbh I saw another mod say that the mod tool excuse was way overblown, and mods can moderate just fine with the official app.

This whole protest thing is so cringe. I saw it on the news the other day and even the casters on TV couldn't understand why it's such a big deal. Just Reddit users overreacting like they always do. No one will be talking about this in a month, promise.

"ToramOnline","t5_39750","They've done a terrible job, in my opinion. Localisation should be about keeping proper tone and meaning, even if it meant changing words around. Toram's English localisation team doesn't seem to get this idea; they simply choose to go with the route of translating for the sake of translating.

I *genuinely* think it's not a group of native English speakers that they've hired to do this. We've seen issues where Indonesian texts were found *in the English texts* — so, my theory is that they've simply hired a team to translate from Indonesian to English, rather than Japanese to English directly.

But seriously, Chapter 11 through 12 (and now 13) has the **worst** immersion to date. Where were the *passable* dialogues we had from earlier chapters, or the decent ones in Chapter 7?",1688169629.0

Shadowhunter is fine class with pretty cheap gem set up. Accessories are expensive and it only does average dmg . It is very tanky and I enjoy bussing with it. I can usually get through most hm without using pots as the healing is alright. Does most mech very easy like Star mechs, Prokel or counter mechs.

Glavier is decent aswell . It will change to entropy backatker which is not everyone playstyle.  Accessories are pretty expensive due to sharing a lot of them with slayer aswell. Tbh I prefer both slayer and deathblade more as backatker than my glavier. 
It will still do better dmg than Shadowhunter.",1688169630.0

Giles appears to Spikes emotional need to connect with Buddy when he chides Spike that friendship with the Scoobies 'are not the way to Buffy'. 

Perhaps Spike is protecting Dawn because he wants to get to Buffy's approval. The summer after season five was not shown, but we can surmise that the presence of the Buffybot for Spike was sufficient for Spike to pretend to be happy and supportive of the Scoobies.",1688169630.0

Those are 3 completely different things. Active duty is a lifestyle where you will be committed to the Military 24/7 for X amount of years. Guard and Reserve is part time, 1 weekend a month and 2 weeks in the summer. You’ll be a civilian almost every day of the year.

"EveHome","t5_2nxofj","The Eve Light Switch is clearly documented as intended to work in a 3-way configuration with a conventional switch.  Parts of it seem to work well.  The Eve Switch remains connected and available regardless of which of the two traveller lines is hot.  It doesn't assume that it's solely responsible for turning on the device, either, presumably because 3-way is intended to be a supported configuration.  I assume it attempts to monitor current drawn across the load output and neutral - as the documentation states that the load needs to draw at least 3W for the switch to work correctly.

It just seems that there's something not quite right about how that mechanism works.  I've read prior posts from others who claimed that it started working for them when they switched back to incandescent bulbs, but obviously that's not a good long-term solution.  Given that my load should be drawing a total of 27W it's well above the specified minimum.

I appreciate your suggestion, which is certainly a creative approach, but given the trouble I've had so far I'd rather stick with what the manufacturer explicitly recommends.  At this point my plan is to switch to a 3-way Leviton dimmer configuration using their companion switch.  It means accepting some Wi-Fi devices alongside Thread, which is a shame, but I'd rather run an intentionally supported configuration.",1688169631.0

Ask for an inspection while it is in for the ac service

Ask their advice on the transmission fluid drain and fill, there is a risk at high mileage if it has never been serviced. They will know best what to advise

All the other systems are risk free to service

If the transmission acts normal, and the fluid is somewhat pink or red or even orange, i advise a drain and fill

If the transmission is jerking and acting up, the fluid is black, and there is no history of service ever, i usually advise running it into the ground at ur mileage

This is complicated and a case by case service

You’re making a lot of assumptions about me and my values, so kindly keep them to yourself. 

I would like to see some sort of reform here. Currently, for example, if I knew who you were I could file a police report alleging domestic violence and depending on where you live, you would have a restraining order taken out, you would need to find a lawyer to represent you, you would need to go get fingerprinted and shortly thereafter you would need to appear at an arraignment. During the entirety of your case, which could take years, background checks would show your charges, and you would have to explain them to your current employer or struggle to find a job. 

And all of that without any evidence that we know each other or that anything constituting domestic violence had happened. 

If this is the system we need in place to protect victims of domestic assault, then it is what it is, but I struggle to believe there aren’t improvements here that can be made to limit harm.",1688169632.0

And in reality those people who would now be considered right, were actually the ones opposed to slavery. The anti-slavery revolution in Britain was not pushed by radical labor but rather by liberal free trade people. 

There is no concept of universal left and right. I guess one could argue there is a universal construct of keeping things as they are and changing them. This issue exists in every society and its a modern western concept to label them as 'left' and 'right'.",1688169632.0

I think its audience has shrunk or stagnant. The entire comicbook film landscape feels passe.

And a lot of the same fans seem to re-watching them, which just illustrate the shrinkage.

I'm still surprised by the lofty expectations on Flash.

Shoutout to Biden too. He knew exactly what he needed to do in 2020 to win. He correctly predicted that Democrats wanted a stable hand and someone who could defeat Trump and he leaned into that and won the primary. Even after the media left him for dead before the South Carolina primary. It was also smart to cozy up to his relationship with Obama as much as he did.  Then in the general election he very much leaned into being a stable leader after four years of craziness and Trump’s disaster COVID response.

No deep cleaning unless the damage is so bad that it's visible in pictures or bad enough guests will say something. They spend most of the time on their phones waiting for laundry to get done. Make it look decent enough for pictures, send to owners, and move on to the next one.

Not expecting you to understand or change your mindset, but take a step back and look at the world around you- ranging from the infrastructure you drive your car on everyday, the structure of the building you work in, the doctor you see when you’re sick, etc… there’s people working on keeping the community you live and work in going all which are meaningful jobs that we had to study to get.

ok this is a situation where i’m really at a loss
i (15m) was hanging out with some friends a few days ago (15 f and 16 F who we’ll call Casey). we were in a jewelry shop in our towns downtown mall and Casey wanted to by a ring and a necklace, but forgot their wallet. i had cash on me, and since i was going to Casey’s house right after, they agreed to pay me right back. the total was $48. 
we went to her house, and she didn’t have that much cash on her, bc she (and her parents) all use card. the only reason i had that much cash on me was bc i got it for my bday a few weeks back. anyways, we decided venmo was the best idea. neither me nor her has a venmo account, but our parents do. so, she sent me her moms (i didn’t remeber my dad’s in the moment and he was working) and i sent it to my dad. i explained the situation to my dad, Casey explained the situation to her mom, and they both seemed to have no big deal w it. 
now, fast forward to today, me, my mom, and my dad were eating out at a restaurant. i mentioned the venmo thing, just reminding my dad to get the money bc i wanted to buy something online with the $50 (me and Casey agreed that she would give me $50 bc i also got her a drink later on). my dad was just asking more details, and my mom sort of LOST it. she said it wasnt “socially conscious” to ask my dad to request money. she said it wansnt “proper etiquette” and i was beyond consumed bc since when were we in the 1500s???? she made it a big deal, and i was very confused and made that very clear, which she saw as me challenging her or something. we ended up arguing quite a bit in the restaurant (a pretty causual place so it wasnt a HUGE deal), and she stormed out after we finished eating. i, still puzzled, just wanted the whole thing to be over so i caved and said i would send my dads venmo to C to send to her mom so that C’s mom would send him the money, which is what my mom claimed was “proper etiquette”. she was still mad at me while we were walking back to our car, and threw the “you made me feel horrible” and the “i guess i’m just a horrible mom” cards that she always does.  throughout this whole fight, she was deadnaming me. i cant be really mad at that bc i literally JUST came out to her, but it made me really angry still. 

so, AITA for not understanding that it wasn’t “proper” to ask my dad to request money on venmo and continuing to ask my mom to clarify on what she ment by “not socially conscious”??? i feel like i may be in the wrong and there’s just some unspoken rule about venmo that i don’t know bc i don’t use it.

"supportlol","t5_3abd1","If perfectly programmed bots were playing LoL, all kills would be given to carries. It is true that your team gets the most value from gold when its on a carry.

That's in a perfect world, and soloq is about as far from a perfect world as possible. 

Use judgment; is a kill about to happen, and there is no chance for them to escape? The gold is better on anyone else but you as a support, unless it's some elo terrorist inting troll, in which case yes, take the kill. The grand conceit of the support role is that we have restricted income because we elevate our carry in other ways.

Is there a chance they get away? Absolutely, blast them and make sure they die. Also, since it's impossible to predict or coordinate team damage output, you are just going to get some kills sometimes. Are some fragile K/D queens going to bitch? Yes. Immediately mute and report them. They're too caught up in their main character syndrome and you won't hear anything worthwhile from a player like that anyway. Instead of figuring out how to get as much advantage from this kill, all they're concerned with is typing cause their K score didn't +1. Fuck 'em.",1688169637.0

These are the practical, tangible benefits of diagnosis, let alone the emotional benefits. Validation, self-image, connection with other autis and ND folk, sharing and learning from others similar experiences, having a language and framework to map out your own experiences...

"florida","t5_2qh7q","I would consult with an attorney.  I had a couple of cousins (third cousin and her husband, so cousin by marriage) here in Florida, who were not the most savory of characters. They did a slip-and-fall scam in a major retailer and got a huge settlement, which they promptly blew on ATVs, new cars, and basically any type of toy that most people don’t really need and that promptly depreciates once it has left the retailer.  In addition to their poor money management, they had poor hygiene as well. When their teeth started going bad, they decided to have them all pulled and use their Medicaid to have themselves some dentures made.  They were shocked to find out that Medicaid had found out about their settlement and assets and dropped them.  So they ended up toothless for as long as it took to sell a bunch of their toys to get enough money to buy the dentures.  I am sure there have to be safe assets (like maybe a retirement account or something) that is not subject to the public assistance asset scrutiny, but I am NAL, so I wouldn’t be able to tell you directly.

Of course, you can buy things that are collectibles as an investment, but they are not all one and the same. You can buy things that are not collectibles as an investment too. 

And you’re wrong about the point. The point is to use them for your profile picture/avatar. That is it. Any other use case has been made up by the users. The fact that they were at one point worth more than people paid for them is not intentional on Reddit’s part. 

Are we getting into technicalities? Sure, you could argue that. But just because something is collectible doesn’t mean it has any inherent value.

"DadForAMinute","t5_3mqmt","There's no reasonable way to deal with unreasonable people.  You have to try and find a way to become financially independent of them so you can call their bluff and walk away.  Figuring something out will take time and effort,  but it will be worth it.  Do you have a friend or relative who might take you in?  Can you get a job and a rommate?  Try your school's financial aid office.  Maybe if you were independent of your parents and went to school through the summer you could get financial aid and live at school year round.  

I'm not telling you to leave your parents.   Only you can decide that.   But I do think you need to stand up to them and stop their overbearing expectations, and to do that you need to have a backup plan in case they're  not willing to see your side.",1688169638.0

"wildfrostgame","t5_4yjkzn","I don't know how much you've played, but the more runs you do the more things you unlock and the more tools you get that will make runs much easier to play around. Also, as you play you should get a feel on how to manage your resources and what enemies you should prioritize and kill with what you have. Against any given enemy your first thought should be ""How do I get to a strong position as quickly as possible?"" What can help you is purchasing crowns, since starting off with more cards on the field is very action-efficient. Don't be afraid to use your turn to hit the redraw bell before it's free if you have a hand that can't get much done. Don't be afraid to use allies as meat shields if you have to, and on the opposite end don't be afraid to pull out an ally and slap them back in the deck for some healing.

I think it's going to leave a sour taste in my mouth and I don't think I'm going to like it. And I hope this doesn't make me (eventually) leave the game :(

My sister (who died about 17 years ago) gifted me (now 23)  a cookie monster plushie when I was a child.

It was left in the basement for over a decade, so when I found it again I decided to sell it at a flea market.
I didn't question my decision until my mom said that I shouldn't have done it.

I still have pictures of my sister around and use other things like her tableware almost daily. She's not forgotten, I just didn't know what else to do with the plush as it has no purpose for me anymore. So I wanted to make another kid happy with it instead.

I told my mom that I'm gonna sell it before I did and she didn't stop me, so I thought it's ok until she complained about it later.

My mom thinks what I did is morally wrong because of the memory that's attached to the item and because my sister searched really ambitious for it to cheer me up.

"BB_Stock","t5_3q7f1y","I agrée with some of this. A few points to add. 

You should take another look at the AGM presentation. One of the IVY slides from this week basically reads: “Blackberry Ivy: Now with Blackberry Cylance AI&ML”. 

Plus, they’ve had a Qnx/Cylance solution for the car since 2020 CES where they presented Cylance in Jaguar/Land Rover model. 

Also, upstream is a cloud based EDR solution. As far as I know they don’t do cybersecurity with a preventative approach on-device like Cylance does. CerebrumX, to my knowledge, doesn’t play in the cybersecurity space. Fleet management, data platform for insurance use cases, is more their jam. 

All that said, I don’t think you’re wrong that they could spin off Cylance and use QNX/IVY for any number of cybersecurity providers. It very well may be the best approach regardless of their internal convergence plans.",1688169639.0

Just gotta work on maxing that first deck. And looking at yours I’d change it asap. 4 legendaries in a deck as a f2p will take insanely long compared to a heavy common/rare focused one. And honestly it doesn’t look like that amazing of a deck anyway. The best heavy legendary decks seem to be something like Rg or bridgespam. 

It is possible to max it and if you love the deck then stick with it and learn it. It’s just going to take longer to max out. You do have a lot more features (wild cards, trading, season shop, level up chests, etc) nowadays that help you max out cards. A lot more than I had anyway.

If you don't want people to comment, you have no business posting on a public forum. If you choose to post, people have the right to comment. People have the right to say things that you didn't ask for, or that you don't like to hear.

>I look forward to babysitting and that thought didn't even cross any of your silly little heads because you apparently despise children so much. I get it they're annoying af but like I said this woman is like my sister. This is my niece we're talking about.

You yourself say that children are 'annoying af'. Why would this child be an exception? Purely because she is your unofficial niece? If a child acts annoying, why would it matter whether she is your niece or not? The child being your niece won't make annoying behaviour any less annoying.

&#x200B;



>My friendship is rock solid. I cannot explain enough times.  


Friendships often change when one person has a child. A lot of rock solid friendships worsen or end because the parent stops giving a fuck about the childfree friend, and/or takes advantage of the childfree friend for free childcare.

When I go to concerts and festivals especially, but even at bars and clubs or just out on the street it's very common.
Not all of them are available even, some are walking around with boyfriends, but they'll find some reason to compliment me and talk to me a little.
Could be absent of intent in some cases but I have gotten better at seeing that in the eyes.
I'm too picky to care 99% of the time, but I wear great outfits and I carry myself well, so it's just inevitable lately.
The biggest boon of this is when I am on a date and my date sees so many people drawn to me and wanting my attention, while I am more focused on her. I think that raises her opinion of me massively, and makes her feel more special for being there with me.
However, I rarely go on dates that would involve such crowds, so the opportunity isn't always there.

Attractive girls kinda just don't hit on anyone btw, not in my experience. I think they're so accustomed to getting that kind of attention that they never learned how, and many of them are insanely shy because of it.",1688169640.0

"boxoffice","t5_2r1ky","Warner Brothers had 6 flops in a row (and might get 1 or 2 more this year) for their DCEU and they are not taking a 10 to 20 year break with their next reboot.

If DCEU is taking just 2 years break what makes you believe the MCU would take one for 10 to 20 years?

I don't believe there is any chance MCU would be put aside for that long. 

And just some comments about the state of MCU.

I would like to point out the fact that Quantumania the MCU flop still made more than the last 6 DCEU movies.
And both before and after it were MCU hits.

I understand that people see Black Panther 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy 3 as disappointments, but both were successful profitable movies.

Since No Way Home the MCU had 4 hits and a single flop with the average box office still at 770m. MCU is in much better condition than some people give it credit for.",1688169640.0

I think the most savings ends up being one of those trilogy bundles...and I'd hesitate to tell somebody to buy an entire whopping trilogy of a series they've never played. It's pretty laid back and gives me enough feels-good energy as a sort of palate cleanser after a depressing story. But uh...don't go into these games expecting any sort of deep, moving plot.    

My Switch titles are filled with Zelda and Xenoblade recently lol. Recently finished Tears of the Kingdom, but might head back in after a break for completionist purposes. I've been giving the Pikmin 4 demo a shot, since Commercial_Poem mentioned she loves the series. It's honestly a bit addicting in a way I can't explain. For third party, I'm thinking of maybe picking up a few visual novels, just for the convenience of the form factor.

>I have not made any claims to hold a position for or against slavery as it holds no relevance to the the argument in your pos

Dude, the paragraph before you literally talked about rape, murder and torture, somehow that has any relevance to the debate? Anyway, let me make it easier for you:

*""You can't say you're against slavery while actively engaging in slave victims.""*

The reason why this argument has relevance in the debate is because if you agree to have any unnecessary electronics made by slaves, you either: aren't against slavery, or are against slavery but actively engage in slave victims, which makes you not only an hypocrite, but a DOUBLE hypocrite, because you'll be criticizing non-vegans for something you do",1688169642.0

It doesn’t treat the root cause of gastroparesis (it doesn’t affect emptying/motility and can cause constipation as a side effect, at higher doses) but it got rid of the baseline nausea I dealt with. I could do and eat a lot of things I couldn’t before because the BASELINE nausea was gone.

The Rising Sun is still used by the Japanese Navy as their official flag, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces uses a variant of it. The Rising Sun was adopted by Japan in 1870, whereas the Swastika was adopted by  the German Nazi Party in the 1930s. Yes, nations harmed by Japan (especially in Asia) during WWII don't like the flag, in much the same way that many middle eastern nations don't like the US flag after our many conflicts in the region.

My advice to finding love is to not seek love out at all, but instead seek out what thrills you. Take up a new hobby, something that gives you a new lease on life. Put yourself out into the world.

Even as a layman, this makes no sense to me. The cracking sounds ARE the weak points breaking, but with every crack the overall structures dynamics change and you have no idea what a “safe” pressure is anymore. I would think after ONE crack in a carbon fibre hull that hull would be compromised and need to be inspected and tested to determine if it’s characteristics are still the same.

You made that up. You still haven't shown any Scripture where Jesus required His followers to disobey God. Do you have any examples of Jesus telling people to make sure they don't do what God said to do? 

He said that no part of God's Law will change and that anyone who doesn't follow it and tells others not to follow it will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. Then He said that those who practice and teach Torah will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. Why are you so comfortable opposing Jesus? 

>So please, I will ask one more time: can you tell me how to ""walk"" as Christ? Be clear and specific. 

I've been clear and specific the whole time. Go back and read what I said again if you need to. I just scrolled up to re read what I said, it's still there and easy to find. Look for the comment that starts with **me quoting you asking the same question** ""How are we to ""walk"" (you refuse to use a more detailed word)?""

I remember being clear and specific when I wrote it.  I quoted Scripture to demonstrate how John used the word ""walk"". 

>Don't dance around the question anymore.

If you want to abide in Him, you must walk even as Jesus did. Nobody is going to force you to abide in Him. It's your choice. To be absolutely clear, nobody can force you to abide in Jesus. But if you do claim to abide in Jesus you must walk even as He walked.",1688169644.0

"ControversialOpinions","t5_2srrs","This has to be the most unironically ignorant comment I've read lol.  a plastic cosmetic surgery... No. There are literal horror stories of children growing out of their ""trans"" phase when in reality they were just confused because of all this propaganda, now they have mutilated their genitalia which is irreversible, they have done permanent damage to their body via hormone treatment, which the damage those do can also be irreversible. You know who the primary victim of this is? Gay boys and lesbian girls. They are essentially made to think that because they are not masculine or feminine, they must be trans, and I'm being literal because I work in the medical field lol. 

It's common for children to feel out of place in their body at times, in fact that's a completely normal psychological process growing up for a lot of kids. What do you think all this trans propaganda is doing to children experiencing these feelings? It's making them falsely believe they are trans, making irreversible changes to their body and forever damaging their psyche. 

So no, it's just another cosmetic surgery. Farthest thing from it.",1688169644.0

"Screenwriting","t5_2qupf","It's always been a constant battle for me, but I got pretty good at dealing with it. I've learned many tricks over the years, but the biggest was setting a realistic \*\*time\*\* writing goal every morning and using a timer on my phone to keep track of that, and refusing to touch the internet while that timer was ticking. 

So let's say you're a parent with a day job and you've got a full work day ahead, plus a kid's soccer game in the evening. By writing 30 minutes in the morning or evening and on your lunch break, you could reasonably get a solid hour in. So that's the goal. Then it's a matter of just opening the document, shutting off wifi, putting the phone on airplane mode, and starting the timer. When you have to stop writing, you pause it. When you hit your 60 minutes, congratulations, you just achieved your goal for the day. Write more if you like, but feel great no matter what.

Do this every single morning and you will get things done. An hour a day really adds up, even if that's all you can manage.

Some people like to set page count and word count goals. Those aren't necessarily a bad thing (especially if you're on a deadline), but sometimes you truly are doing good writing work when you're thinking hard about your story, and my feeling has always been that that time should be counted.",1688169644.0

I'm not in the US and the 300/300/100 protocol that the US seem to use is not done here. We just stay on it until we want to stop, and the fact that it's free and not dependent on insurance cover makes it easy to do it this way.

I was in therapy last year and diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder and cyclothymic disorder. Here’s some information for those of you who don’t know what it is. 

https://www.everydayhealth.com/cyclothymia/ 

I grew up gay in Tennessee. I came out in the 8th grade and was harassed a lot of the time. The only time I tried to stand up for myself (after the fact that the teacher who was not even five feet away didn’t say anything) was when the teaching assistant took me out of the classroom, closed the door, and gave me a speech. Basically telling me to shut up. 

I have really nasty violent intrusive thoughts. However, a lot of the time, I just go through really heated arguments. From having a narcissistic father who wouldn’t bother trying to hear me out on arguments, and what happened with the teaching assistant, as well as other things similar to what happened, I’ve had to deal with these with my anxiety for the past seven years now. 

I say that I’m borderline agoraphobic because I know damn well that people can be down right bat shit crazy. I say that because there’s a fear for me since I always heard about people in my school that a family member of theirs planned to kill someone because they’re lesbian or gay or whatever.  This has made stay kept inside, which has ruined my health. I’m vitamin d deficient now. 

I’m trying to work on getting out of the house more to better myself in that way. 
I like how someone else put it. It’s not linked to our sexual orientation. It’s linked to how we were treated. 

So I do agree with you!

I’ve felt mentally healthier lately for the past few months. I wish and hope there is a day where you can be the same. 

I wish you the best of luck!",1688169645.0

We were very young when we got together and had some rough spots but ultimately we grew and changed for the better together, and most importantly we changed in the same ways. Our life goals are aligned, which is very important.

He's my best friend. My soul mate if you believe such things. My one and only forever. I have decided that, should something happen to him and I'm alone, I'll stay that way. I will never be able to love anyone else as much or give as much of myself to anyone else other than him, and that wouldn't be fair to the other person. 

We don't want children but if we had any I know I would agree with OP and love my husband more. It's kind of an obligation to love your children whereas my husband was my choice, so I totally agree with and understand OP.

>Os tugas que saíram desde 2008 começam agora a voltar, começaram a descobrir que o el dorado não é assim tão dourado e preferem voltar a portugal, e mesmo os com mais cursos. Sim não falo dos lavadores de sanitas.

Todos os 15? Comparar a ordem de grandeza das centenas portugueses retornados com as centenas de milhar de imigrantes que cá permitem viver de forma extremamente precária é intelectualmente desonesto.

&#x200B;

>As zonas do Alentejo que estão agora nessa situação estão assim pelos abusadores tugas.

Suponho que te estejas a referir ao patronato, e não às mulheres e crianças assediadas nas ruas, praias e escolas. É para prevenir situações de exploração laboral que pagamos impostos e temos um governo (ou deveria ser).

&#x200B;

>E não é de todo reflexo do Portugal inteiro.

Tornou-se no que é em menos de 5 anos. Quando será para ti a altura de rectificar este tipo de situações?

&#x200B;

>Portugal, tem contas a pagar por mais de 500 anos de abuso sobre outros países

Errado. Nenhum português vivo deve o que quer que seja a qualquer outra pessoa viva por causa de ""maus tratos passados"". Se assim não fosse também exijo uma indemnização a Marrocos por causa das mulheres que raptavam das vilas costeiras de Portugal continental e dos arquipélagos dos Açores e Madeira. O mesmo vale para os franceses, pela guerra napoleónica. E para os italianos, pelo genocídio dos celtas na península ibérica.

Os filhos não herdam as dívidas dos pais. Se te causa azia é problema teu, e mais ninguém tem de sofrer pela tua auto-flagelação.

&#x200B;

>E ainda por cima ainda fazem o que não queremos fazer.

Não insistas nessa mentira. Fazem o que não é possível fazer pagando renda em casal e tendo o que comer.

&#x200B;

>A redução da qualidade de vida é resultado da crise e não dos emigrantes.

A redução da qualidade de vida dos portugueses em início de vida adulta decorre directamente da situação da imigração. Quem está agora a tentar sair de casa dos pais é forçado a competir com rendas absurdas, porque custa mais a um casal juntar 2000€/mês do que a 15 pessoas a juntar 133€/pessoa/mês.

&#x200B;

>Além disso a maioria dos trabalhos que ficam por preencher bem pagos em Portugal ficam por preencher por falta de estudos e não por falta de gente.

Hás de me explicar porque é que a emigração portuguesa é de mão-de-obra extremamente qualificada, então. O tecido empresarial português não os absorve porque não está disposto/capaz de pagar salários dignos. Não faltam engenheiros e arquitectos a trabalhar a recibos verdes (conheço pessoalmente uns quantos).

&#x200B;

>A maioria dos emigrantes que vivem aos 10 num t1 fazem o que os portugueses fazem quando emigram. O trabalho que ninguém quer.

E isto é suposto legitimar a situação?

&#x200B;

>Pois entre 1994 3 2008 tivemos uma subida de 1000 a 2000 crianças ano. E reduziu e depois estabilizou. Ou seja, nada abonatório para a manutenção das nossas pensões.

Ordenados baixos têm baixos descontos. Não é a explorar imigrantes a receber ordenado mínimo que este problema se resolve, até porque estes ditos imigrantes envelhecem e vão precisar de usufruir de pensões, também.

O problema é estrutural e tem de ser resolvido. O garrafão está roto, mas em vez de o remendarem pôem-lhe mais água.

&#x200B;

>O problema não é de todo Português, é mundial.

Exacto, é estrutural do capitalismo conforme tem sido praticado. Não é explorando imigrantes que vai ser resolvido.

&#x200B;

>Mas mesmo assim gera os problemas como os que estamos a ver em França.

Os problemas em França são o resultado do multiculturalismo. Não preciso de me alongar demasiado, **mas ninguém perguntou ao cidadão francês se queria ser substituído por imigrantes que não se assimilam na cultura francesa** (idem com Portugal).

&#x200B;

>Logo, sim, vamos precisar de toda a gente que queira ter filhos em Portugal.

Estou grato por viver num Estado laico e democrático, em que as mulheres têm os mesmos direitos que os homens e em que quem não for heterossexual não é executado. 

A importação em massa de pessoas que discordam fundamentalmente com essas e outras liberdades conquistadas pelos meus antepassados leva à erosão dos valores da minha cultura e sociedade.

Os portugueses não querem isso e estão no seu direito.

Quando os brasileiros, paquistaneses, angolanos, búlgaros se fartarem de Portugal podem voltar para o seu país e encontrá-lo com a sua cultura e religião; para o português e o europeu ocidental o mesmo não é verdade.

&#x200B;

>A maioria dos grandes países da europa só se tornaram grandes graças aos emigrantes.

Falso. A imigração em massa é um fenómeno que teve a sua génese em meados do século XX. As pessoas imigraram para a europa e os EUA porque eram países desenvolvidos; não foram para lá para altruistamente os desenvolver.

Mas também podes consultar os vencedores dos prémios Nobel, a ver se lá encontras emigrantes não europeus. Não encontrarás muitos.

You step in and help her, first at the circus and then by letting her see the world outside of circus life. What she does with that experience is up to her. I do think she idolizes the PC a little too much at the start, but that's also understandable. She's had a very sad life on the surface and you swept in to save her. Helping her overcome her trauma with kindness is only a benefit to her. I think the only point of contention is whether or not it's ethical for the PC to have a romantic relationship with her. But she isn't as naive as she seems, she's not a child and you never formally entered into any doctor-patient relationship. 

Jaheira is definitely on the rebound for young dick and needs to be stopped.

Viconia is probably more traumatized than Aerie. Hers is buried deeper and she treats others like shit, so it's harder to see. But she wakes up screaming in the night, remembering what she went through underground. She'd do better with some real kindness that doesn't have any sexual motive.",1688169646.0

I can not think of any harm it would do to her if it was moved forward so I think that is being pretty petty.  If she is this bossy now it will be much worse if you marry this girl.

Before others start about how compromises have to be made in a relationship I fully understand and agree with all of that.  But to not be able to move that speaker to the edge of the stand.  That makes absolutely no sense to me.

My experience is arriving from ireland (where passengers pass thru US customs and immigration at Dublin). I could summon an Uber when the aircraft doors opened, walk off the flight, take an escalator down to arrivals, and walk out to the kerb in time to meet the driver. 

If you do need to check a bag there was an issue because there was only one baggage carousel available for domestic / ireland flights, but that should be fixed with the recent renovations. 

AFAIK there is currently roadway construction at T5 which likely means you need to get to a different terminal to catch a hotel shuttle",1688169647.0

They originally came across Malaysia by accident as they were touring at other SE Asian countries and their only last option was like some other country and Malaysia. Since then, they have loved Malaysia so much, they are willing to find a way to get citizenship in Malaysia despite being difficult. 

But, I think their channel is kind of different from the other channels because as of now, they are making videos of being in China, of all places?

If your mom is calling you 5x a day when you’re 29 yourself, your mom has serious issues.

You know why he did it?  So people like you would direct their anger towards scotus when they inevitably ruled against Biden’s attempt to forgive loans.

You should be pissed at the career politicians (like Biden) who, for decades, have ignored a broken system that continues to drive higher education costs through the roof.

The politicians won’t fix it because there are too many donors in higher ed who contribute to their re-elections.

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","In ESO many Orcish clans still follow the Code. Yes, it varies greatly in practice and application; as you say, it's comparable to Jewish legal debates. Each Jewish community might take a different approach to covenantal law, and the Orcs are the same. For all the claims that Orcs don't follow the Code, the majority of clans we see follow it in one way or another. Bethesda isn't backpedalling, it's advancing and developing the lore.

I think that the Code is often underappreciated because of confusions from TES V. Within every single clan in TES V, there is deviation from the Code, because that's entirely the point: it's an interpretive framework. The general principles that we know instruct the ruling family of the stronghold, but there are many others, often contracted to the mines. There are siblings allowed to stay, there are aunts as wise women, there are step-children of the chief.

The Code as initially presented to us isn't erroneous, it's incomplete; we never had the fullness of the stronghold explained.",1688169648.0

"LearnJapanese","t5_2qyls","#Question Etiquette Guidelines:

* **1** Provide the **CONTEXT** of the grammar, vocabulary or sentence you are having trouble with as much as possible. Provide the sentence or paragraph that you saw it in. Make your questions as specific as possible.

>Ｘ What is the difference between の and が ?

>◯ I saw a book called 日本人の知らない日本語 , why is の used there instead of が ? [(the answer)](https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/68336/difference-between-%E3%81%8C-%E3%81%AE-and-no-particle)

* **2** When asking for a translation or how to say something, it's best to try to **attempt it yourself** first, even if you are not confident about it. Or ask r/translator if you have no idea. We are also not here to do your homework for you. 

>Ｘ What does this mean?

>◯ I am having trouble with this part of this sentence from NHK Easy News. I think it means (*attempt here*), but I am not sure.


* **3** Questions based on DeepL and Google Translate and other machine learning applications are discouraged, [these are not beginner learning tools](https://old.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/stepqf/deeplgoogle_translate_are_not_learning_tools/) and often make mistakes.

* **4** When asking about differences between words, try to explain the situations in which you've seen them or are trying to use them. If you just post a list of synonyms you got from looking something up in a E-J dictionary, people might be disinclined to answer your question because it's low-effort. Remember that Google Image Search is also a great resource for visualizing the difference between similar words.

>Ｘ What's the difference between 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意?

>◯ Jisho says 一致 同意 賛成 納得 合意 all seem to mean ""agreement"". I'm trying to say something like ""I completely agree with your opinion"". Does 全く同感です。 work? Or is one of the other words better?

* **5** It is always nice to (but not required to) try to search for the answer to something yourself first. Especially for beginner questions or questions that are very broad. For example, asking about [the difference between は and が ](https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/wa-and-ga/) or [why you often can't hear the ""u"" sound in ""desu""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_phonology#Devoicing).

* **6** Remember that everyone answering questions here is an unpaid volunteer doing this out of the goodness of their own heart, so try to show appreciation and not be too presumptuous/defensive/offended if the answer you get isn't exactly what you wanted.

If the bug was dead when fed to the trap: the trap wasn't stimulated enough that the plant recognized it as food. The initial stimulation triggers the trap to begin closing, but it's the struggling of the insect inside the closing trap that really tells the plant to begin sealing the trap fully and releasing the digestive enzymes.

I think my plan is what you mentioned: so arriving at like 930ish, through the west entrance - estimating an hour at most to get inside, and then asking someone about where to fall in line. If I manage to get into line for the panel that is before my 1230 panel then so be it. I’ll stay until my panel starts. Sounds good? LOL and then afterwards I’ll stay for the 2:30 toho panel. By that time I would have no food in my stomach. Please tell me there are like food stalls or bathrooms in that hall??",1688169649.0

"AITAH","t5_446kys","I’m not well endowed so I like to help level the playing field. Before I used to just overcompensate by giving more head and learning to be better at it, but surprisingly without toys my ex was very satisfied. But when she got her first toy (a g-spot vibrator), I MYSELF, wanted to please her even more. So with her at least, we elevated our sex life together. I have plans to buy a little toy soon, something similar to what we used to use.

Edit: I say it was “surprisingly” because I’ve always been self-conscious about my body :( she always reassured me that sex was amazing, but I always let my mind get the better of me. Sorry for the ramble haha idk why I needed to add that",1688169649.0

American brown toads are pretty happy with any temperature and humidity you are happy with. Anecdotally, younger toads like it more humid than older toads. Having a shallow, large water dish allows them to hydrate and use the bathroom as they need. They survive well on a staple diet of earthworms, crickets, and anything that is clearly small enough to fit in their mouth. Dusting their food with any amphibian calcium/vitamin supplement is a great idea. Ensure it is for amphibians specifically, some reptile specific vitamins can be harmful. Other than that, make sure your hands are clean or gloved when collecting your toads (and make sure to comply with any local, state, or federal legislation regarding the capture of wild animals.",1688169649.0

I don’t know if what you say is true, but lots and lots of musicians are famous for drinking heavy, abusing drugs (not just prescription like Michael), skipping sessions and yet they can create great music. The presence of one doesn’t negate the other. 

Plus he was going through legal and personal issues right before recording History, and still created a great album (my personal favorite). So in what way would Invincible be different in that regard, to now assume he’s maliciously taking credit? 

I don’t really understand fans who continuously feel the need to criticize and pick apart someone’s life (especially one who’s passed) and act like they’re doing something new, and to standards they wouldn’t even hold their own lives to (just based on a quick glimpse through your comment history).

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","Your wife supported you through thick and thin and now you are in a good place you want to leave her because of your guilt for how you maltreated her- if you do it you will be making her pay for your mistreatment of her which is not fair. 

You love your wife dearly and found a new level of appreciation and respect for her hence the guilt, this sounds like a woman who you can build a good life and long-term relationship with; to work on it look at your trusts, attraction to each other, be honest and each other's support and much more. Men who date can attest that there aren't many women who would stand by their man through rough times like yours have. Friend, the grass is not always greener on the other side (in this case your crush). Your wife has not caused an offence or series of offences to justify ending a commitment relationship that you have with her. From what you said, the sole reason why you have a temporary interest in that other woman (not your wife) is because you haven't mistreated her. Your guilt can be used to remind you how you never want to treat a woman that you adore. This is an opportunity to redeem yourself for mistreating your wife by treating her in the way she deserves. Treat her better for your sake and for her sake. If you don't respect the woman you love you will likely repeat this mistreatment of women with others.

Take this opportunity as a chance to grow your character. Do not let your guilt cause you to make a series of mistakes. When you have love protect it and cultivate it and not abandon it. Regularly demonstrate your respect, admiration and appreciation to your wife.

Edit:

I am sorry if I come across as judgemental, don't mean to.

You are a good character for reflecting on how you mistreated your wife, with this knowledge you can adjust your behaviour so you don't cross the line that you don't want to. Permit your wife to respectfully call you out when you are offensive to her or to another. Correct your wrong doing, I hope that you become the version you wish to be and that you have happiness in yourself and your relationships. Best of advice to you.",1688169650.0

It's not like your wife has a career that she loves and refuses to give up because there's upward mobility or personal satisfaction or helping people or whatever. This is entirely a job that she has taken to get away from her kids and in order to do this job she's putting more stress on you and costing the family money. That is a very selfish choice.

&#x200B;

To answer your question in more specific and spoilery detail:

>!When their mother was already pregnant with Annette, she made a wish for a son on the cursed coffins passed down in the family line so that she could maybe possibly be slightly less abused all to hell by her husband the duke because a wife's only value, only purpose in this world is to birth male heirs. To make this wish possible since she already had a girl fetus inside of her, the avatar of the curse adds a demon fetus in her belly alongside Annette so that they'll be born as twins and then magically added a veneer of humanity to the demon to allow it to blend in. There is a panel showing the two children inside the womb and the demon does not have an umbilical cord. When they are born, if I'm remembering right the demon child takes a moment to look at baby Annette while still appearing as a demon to kind of calibrate his human illusion. It is debatable how much sentience or agency he has in this action given that he is an infant. The mother and nurse maid now know that the baby John is a demon and not human.!<

&#x200B;

>!The mother never once treats John like anything less than an untouchable, horrible monster but initially does so by neglecting him completely. The nurse maid sometimes shows a crumb of pity towards him but otherwise does the same. For his part, John doesn't seem to be self-aware of the fact that he is not human as a child other than that moment at his birth. However, Annette and John are otherwise raised as brother and sister with a relatively ""normal"" childhood and it isn't until a specific incident around maybe age ten or so that John is confronted by his mother and explicitly told that he is not human. So there's your answer. Strictly biologically, no. But in all other respects they were raised as siblings and never once stop thinking of each other as brother and sister, they just add more labels to their relationship but don't really take those familial ones away.!<",1688169651.0

-
OP account posts the thing, second account asks where they can buy it, then the OP or a third account links to their store page selling gear with copyrighted/trademarked art that they don't have rights to nor did they pay for.

Eventually it gets reported to the printing company that the OP is breaking their TOS, so their store page is deleted and OP creates a new one with another account and repeats the process.

It's such a common thing that many subreddits have rules specifically targeted at it and named them: ""T-shirt spammers"".

#1. NO, WE DO NOT DISCLOSE OUR ACCOUNT AGE OR KARMA REQUIREMENTS.

#2. NO, WE DO NOT GRANT EXCEPTIONS.

#3. NO, WE DO NOT OFFER VERIFICATION.

#4. NO, THE BOT DIDN'T FUCK UP, IT IS EXCELLENT AT COUNTING.

#NOTE: WE EVALUATE POST KARMA AND COMMENT KARMA SEPARATELY.

#IF YOU MESSAGE US ABOUT ANY OF THOSE THINGS, YOU WILL BE MUTED.

"Re_Zero","t5_3e076","There are some things to be considered: 

1) Emilia's magic is fire and Satella's is shadow. It is stated that someone's magic is permanent and cannot be changed. 

2) In Arc 3, when Subaru tells Emilia he returns by death, Satella kills Emilia. If she is Emilia herself then she would have killed her younger self, leading to a time-loop paradox. If she died that day in Subaru's arms then she would never have become Satella and would never have been able to kill herself that day, therefore she should be alive. Its a paradox. The only solution is multiple timelines, but thats messed up.

3) Re:Zero has, since episode 1, been known for its unpredictability, its extremely difficult to predict anything that is going to happen. So, I feel like its highly unlikely that such an unpredictable show would choose for such a predictable finale.

I too personally believe that Emilia must have some kind of connection to Satella, there MUST be something, but TBH... I have NO IDEA what it is. But I bet my salary that she is not Satella herself.

What are your thoughts on Emilia's Mother? I feel like this is very relevant to this subject of Satella, I want to hear your theories about it.",1688169655.0

Met the baby daddy who was the dealer. Not her. And by October of that same year she was busted with 12 gs of meff. That’s it. In a nutshell. No big cartel debts. No “putting in work” in the streets. No making name for herself. No sewing arms to Carlos who heard she was a nurse lol. None of that, just another pitiful story of an addict. There are millions of stories just like that. Usually, people in recovery skip that part by “qualifying” in 2-3 sentences and go on to the actual recovery.

"tifu","t5_2to41","This is the exact reason that I, as a gay man, would not even put my face on Grindr back when I used to use it. 

When I was 18, I originally had a hiking picture up. Seemed like the general understanding was ""NPNC"" (no pic, no chat), so I caved and did added a picture albeit I was still closeted at that time. An older, mid 50's, man tried talking to me extremely aggressively. Like, sexual harassment aggressively. I didn't have any more blocks left, and I was enjoying a couple conversations with others on the app, so I just ignored him. His messages got more and more intense and I finally blocked him. 

About 2 weeks later, I was grocery shopping with my grandmother and the same guy approached me. He's obviously unhinged and he approached alone as my grandmother was on the other side of the produce area. He was asking me if I thought I was too good for him, and why I'm such an entitled little queen (I'm not even flamboyant, so that was an odd remark). My grandmother noticed the commotion and came over, to which he told HER that she raised an ungrateful little bitch who needs to learn manners and not disrespect the people that fought for ""our"" rights. A few more words were exchanged where she told him to leave me alone, etc, and we left the store. 

So I got to explain to my very Christian grandmother that not only am I gay, but I was on a gay dating site. She looked into it and saw it was for hookups (was not my focus at the time) and went even more ballistic. I ended up getting kicked out with nowhere to go until I started college 3 weeks later, and my entire family was told against my wishes. 

I'm currently 26 and in a very happy, 5 year long relationship, but back when I used Grindr following that instance (or when my bf and I used it for threesomes) I refused and will refuse to put up a picture identifying me. I will gladly give it to someone, should we chat for 10-15 minutes and I can know they aren't crazy, but I won't subject myself to the same risk. 

TLDR, similar thing happened to me. Ended up with me getting kicked out of home and outed.",1688169656.0

These are not sitting around with only root login for any period of time. I'm fact once our packages are installed, root is strongly restricted.

A device in your apartment or your neighbor's apartment heard or misheard something and spoke out loud.  It happens all the time.

De hecho sali´ó un estudio hace poco que dec´ía que los alumnos universitarios rend´ían mejor cerca del mediod´ía, pero, bueno, no es aplicable caso por caso. OP: Encontr´á el horario en que te ande mejor la cabeza para esto.

Hay diarios tipo el New York Times que vienen con una advertencia de cu´ánto tardar´ían en leerse todos los art´ículos, lo cual a m´í me parece medio una cagada. Como que hay un culto por “no perder el tiempo” que hace que no usemos tiempo en nada y lo terminemos perdiendo.

I’m very verbal with my husband, because the man is either clueless or forgetful. I would say “that’s the spot don’t stop” or “this helps me keep going”, etc etc. Ya may not be hittin’ what she needs to be happy and satisfied.

ALSO he is not innocent either… he should have been a bigger man and shut it down).

That said, this is not OK. I know it’s a competitor but this does feel like something you are in your rights to let his employer know. It reflects on his company. You said yourself that you recognized him and where he works. If it were me I’d work out someone in HR at his company to send the video with a matter of fact explanation of what you saw and what he did.

"bassfishing","t5_2quue","Uni: Great knot all around. Not the smallest, not quite the strongest, but it's reliable. Even works with braid, though you may need more wraps. BONUS: variations can also be used to form bobber/bead stops, snells, and splices. If you only want to learn one knot, this is as good as you'll get.

Palomar: Very strong knot. Very easy to tie. Probably the best knot for braid. Awesome for non-terminal tackle, such as a Carolina rig's swivel, because you can control your breaking point with a weaker knot at the very end. I personally don't like using it with large lures because it wastes more material on the tag end, and I don't like using it with multiple treble hooks because it often tangles in them.

Improved clinch: I grew up with this one. It worked great for years. Then one day I broke off every lure I tied with this until I started tying the Uni. Took it as a sign and never went back. I'm almost certainly just being superstitious, because everything I hear says they perform similarly.

Personally, I tie the Uni more than anything else. The Palomar is also good to know, if only for drop shotting. Like I said though, it's also good for controlling your weakest point in the rig.",1688169661.0

The US (I’m sad to say) literally can’t build these types of things. Too much corruption and legit legal issues with private property to ever complete this for less that $500B which then makes the exercise pointless. 

If you want public transport move to Europe or Asia. It ain’t ever going to happen here. I grew up in Germany and Asia and yea their system is awesome but it just won’t happen here. It doesn’t matter who you vote for. I’m sorry but this is America. You will drive and be stuck in traffic sometimes and there is nothing that will ever change. 

If for some reason the city found $500B to spend on this and compete it in the next 20 years, the following two years would fill it up with homeless degenerates who then disgust everyone to the point that they would no longer than the public transport and the roads would once again be fucked.

"instacart","t5_3178u","I’m sorry you’re unable afford a tip but unfortunately drivers rely on tips. If you don’t tip, you’re essentially asking/wanting the driver to pay money out of *their* pocket to make sure you get your groceries delivered. 

No tip for them means: 1. They’re not getting paid an hourly wage (or any wage for that matter) and 2. The gas it took them to get to the store then deliver the order to your house would be paid for using their own money. That’s not right and I’m sure you wouldn’t come out of your pocket for some person’s groceries on InstaCart. 

Just a little tip to maybe help you afford a tip in the future— there are websites you can sign up on to take surveys and get paid. One I use quite often is called Ipsos Isay. They do product testing and surveys. One of the payment options is a Visa gift card. Once you earn enough points to redeem, all you have to do is click the Visa gift card option and it comes to your email immediately. You can then use that gift card to pay for a tip! :)",1688169663.0

"MDEnts","t5_2sjb5","Some price increases aside, most are result of vendor costs going up… some of us been warning about this coming. These are contingent of NEW BATCH PRICES: 

Curio everyday is $35 pretty much across the board, $50-$60 for exclusive. Carts are fluctuating big time… goodday, goodnight, GI are $35 now, other ones $33.. 

Culta 3.5s that were $30 now $40, cost per unit went up from the supplier… some $45, $50, top tiers $60. 

District that aren’t low testing are $10 a gram… $140 halves of the devils driver, spritzer, layer, etc. Gelato Cake went from $25 retail to $28 this week. 

Holistic is one that hasn’t skyrocketed. 3.5’s have stuck around $35, Garcia some are $45 now, but some up at $50 again. for them I don’t care, a few more bucks is worth it. 

SML concentrates are up, was $42 at first, now most are $45. Snoop 3.5 is a whopping $45 (yea right… all yours rec folks!!), cookies carts are back up to $70. 

NH RSO went up $5. 

I could go on… this can explain some price increases but dispos that are charging $65+ for Culta are blatantly price gouging. Don’t support them.",1688169663.0

"ukraine","t5_2qqcn","Agreed. I really shouldn't have brought it up. It just angers me so much that such public figures are able to be that unhinged from reality and actually spread extreme misinformation. I would also like to point out it was not a stab at the US either (not that you thought it was) the vast population of the US are not like that at all. We have similar dickwits here in Australia... Social media man. It's powerful in all aspects. It can connect as strong as it can segregate. 

In this community, it is profound how many genuine humans there are. It's something. Most of the World is backing Ukraine and I too look forward to the day the war is over. The senseless destruction, pain, suffering and death is heartbreaking. All because of an unhinged ""leader"".

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I got one in High school during a collision in a football summer camp scrimmage with no pads. I remember seeing the ball in the air, thinking I was going to catch it, then suddenly I’m standing on the sideline. 

Apparently I got up and walked off the field, but I have no recollection of it. When I came too the coach was asking “how many fingers am I holding up”and “what day is it?”

At that point I felt okay, slight headache, but extremely confused. They gave me water and had me sit down. Before we got in the van to go home the coach asked me if I felt nauseous and I said no. About two minutes after the van started moving I had them stop and I threw up. Had a constant headache and light sensitivity for about a day or two after. 

The way I describe a concussion is take the worst hangover you’ve had, then double it.",1688169663.0

For the price of a big Mac meal, I believe it's around 10$ right now, I can buy 1lb organic chicken breast, head off lettuce and buns and make two meals. I don't really have any authority to talk, in my 20s I agree shit all the time but once I had kids I wanted to give them good food to eat so I had to learn to cook and I'm glad I did. Then I started small with growing food in summer, some tomatoes, corn, potatoes and it got bigger ever year. Ultimately you are right, but good health from eating good food is a worry while investment and initially requires some adjustment financially. It's costing me about 650$a month to feed 6 people in my house mostly organic, it was significantly cheaper before the pandemic, but it is what it is now.",1688169664.0

"GoRVing","t5_2qu0e","This is factually incorrect.  You start needing a CDL when the GVWR of the vehicle exceeds 26k lbs and the vehicle is being operated commercially.  ""OPerating commercially"" typically means that the vehicle and/or cargo do not belong to the operator or that the operator is transporting goods they DO own for sale OR ... and here's the big one ... the operator is being paid to transport the vehicle.

The 5th wheel guys who get Class 8 trucks are exempt because there are specific exceptions explicitly for privately operated recreational vehicles and/or the vehicles towing them.  The race teams with the Class 8 trucks and giant haulers have CDL drivers to run them.

Could you run without?  Sure.  Are you likely to get away with it in this case?  Probably.  At least for a while.  But, once you get caught doing it, you're in a lot of trouble really quick.  Best to just not play that game.

As for the state-level restrictions, you're right.  However, of the states that I am aware of, those restrictions are BASED on interstate commerce regs which do not apply here because a) it's an RV for which there is an explicit exception, and b) I'm not engaged in commerce so none of that actually applies anyway.

The whole point of the game is that teams of hunters (or a lone wolf if you'd like, but you'llbe fighting teams) go in to hunt a big boss monster and get the bounty. However, there's only 1-2 bosses to go around among 12 people, so people will inevitably kill each while finding the boss, killing the boss, and trying to get out with the bounty. You'll also find plenty of people who prefer to chase fights over strictly playing the objective. 

I usually get 1-2 fights per match, which could be me and my partners instantly killing some poor, unaware whiteshirts, or it they could be every player in the server descending on a compound at once and having a 10 minute mix of brawls and stand offs

There are 4 main bosses and a brand new mini boss. None of them are particularly hard on their own if you know what you're doing, but they can screw if a fight breaks out while you're fighting them.

She thinks that no matter what she does that you won't leave her and you think that the affair is over simply because you discovered it. Only one of you is right.

Cutting out the AP is reconciliation #101. She still works with him and sees him every day at work. He actually spends more time with her than you do! Whilst this situation exists then it'll only go one way.

Any solo night out is suspect this early in reconciliation. This one especially. Either he'll '*just turn up unexpectedly**^(TM')* or she will just forego the night out, maybe cut it short, so that she can go on a date with him. 

There's a fair chance that most if not all the co workers know about the affair: affairs don't happen in silos. They'll cover for her. They *like* both your Gf and AP and want them to be 'happy'. It's a fair bet that your Gf has done a hatchet job on your reputation with these co workers and they *don't like* you due to this.

When faced with infidelity some people realise that the relationship is over immediately. Others require more pain to be inflicted before reaching the same conclusion. I get that you aren't in this place mentally and don't want the relationship to be over. Reconciliation takes her to be in the same space mentally too & she just doesn't seem anywhere near to it right now?

Why not treat one of your friends that she doesn't know so well to a night out at the same venue that her co workers are going to if you require more evidence? Everyone is a reporter/PI these days due to cell phones.",1688169664.0

The Super Professional has a longer seat tube and I would have needed to go down a size. I think you could ride either the 52 or 55 cm space horse, but would probably want a 52 Super Pro, especially if you're going to use a dropper post. All-City's sizes are based on seat tube length measured to the top of the top tube, while other brands go by the actual seat tube length.

"skinwalkerranch","t5_2ynpk","MantisAwakening , thanks for how often you reply to my commentary on the subreddit. I believe that it's likely that Demons do exist, but to seek them out, you're probably as likely to create your own experience as you are to run into something ""real"" --- as in not false.  
in christianity and many other religions, Satan / lucifer / the devil / etc is defined as ""the father of lies"" etc, and so wouldn't it be logical to make sense that an underling of ""the father of lies"" (or a demon) would be under a defined goal of lies and deception and other forms of untruth.   
I know that doesn't help with anything if you can't ever really prove something is or isn't legitimately a demon, but the ""FACT"" is either ""true"" or ""false"" , whether or not we know the factual answer. the best thing to do, in my opinion, is to imply that we don't currently have a perfect method to measure for what is or isn't demons. That makes it really hard for science to have anything remotely similar to a conclusion on what is or isn't ""demons"", and that bugs me, but I accept it because I just don't have all the answers.  
there's also a chance that a spirit or ghost is pretending to be a demon for one reason or another , if they wanted to be perceived that way, we'd have no way to negate a perception beyond what is or isn't ""true"" ... and we can't measure for what is or isn't a demon, so we're kinda stuck with guessing , or maybe making an educated guess. That's all I can say on the topic, all I can really suggest on the topic from a scientific perspective. At least in my opinion anyway.",1688169665.0

"law","t5_2qh9k","I understand what you mean that Plessy was engineered to take to trial, but the fictional gay wedding website case was not (unless you believe the plaintiff - who made up her case out of whole cloth - engineered her work of fiction specifically to challenge the law. Which... I know SCOTUS heard the case and ruled on it, but they should have tossed it out. When your ""facts"" are actually lies, there's nothing stopping you from changing them as you see fit to get the outcome you desire. In Plessy, there were still concrete facts of the case and the man who was arrested was a real man who was really arrested.

So again I reiterate, the only similarity here is that SCOTUS also ruled Plessy incorrectly, but since you seemed in your first post to agree with SCOTUS' decision to hear the fictional gay wedding website case, the implication I took was that you also agreed with Plessy.

As for the other comment, I saw that and agree with the other poster. If standing doesn't matter, then you're opening the floodgates for millions, if not billions of lawsuits, many of which will be double jeopardy, most of which will be incorrectly filed, and so on and so forth. Standing is not only important for showing there are actual facts to the case and actual harm caused, but also to prevent exactly this sort of nonsense like someone reading a law, imagining a fictional scenario, and then suing because their imagination scares them.

It's the legal equivalent of your girlfriend breaking up with you because she dreamed you cheated. This SCOTUS is a joke.",1688169665.0

Might as well ask when will the general public will be able to fly to Mars on vacation or own their own regular flying automobile to take to work, because we could have already been doing that if enough R&D resources were put into it since we have the tech already. 

Could look at any of the timelines in sci fi like Fire fly, Star Trek or the Expanse for when space travel became common place and that would be as good a guess as any. 

If the governments have had alien space travel tech for as long as some think they have and weren't corrupt as fuck then we could already be doing it, maybe on a personal craft level or at least a cruise ship vacation level. 

It's just impossible to do more that speculate for fun because the level of tech and government shenanigans are unknown. 

With more theoretical detail, a better guess could be made. For example, has the government just recently discovered in the last few years how to build a craft that could get us to Mars in days with minimal fuel? Or have they already been warping to other solar systems or even galaxies for decades? 

The same type of speculation relates to guessing where the aliens came from in the first place, which would correlate with their tech. Are they an ancient human civilization that lives on the far side of the moon or under the Earth's oceans? Or are they from another planet in another solar system? Is the solar system close to us? Other side of the galaxy? Another galaxy? Another dimension? 

The space travel tech would be vastly different between each and would effect Earth tech in vastly different ways, without even considering how human corruption would effect the timeline for the public to benefit directly.",1688169665.0

"Showerthoughts","t5_2szyo","I used to work for a company like that, we would get paid near minimum wage hourly, but the 2 to 4 man install crew would get paid 10 percent of whatever the customer paid split between them. They started us out with smaller jobs, and if we worked fast we got bigger jobs, or 2 in a day.

The lazy people got filtered out pretty fast since if we didn't do a job exactly right we had to go back and fix it, and people being lazy and taking shortcuts had to go back often, which could mean an entire day lost.
Also everybody was pretty open about what they were making, so the people who couldn't do jobs fast or correctly felt like they were being underpaid.

Only reason I quit was because one of the managers was a total dick, and only had the job because he was friends with the owner. I was on a couple jobs where he took lead on the install and everything he did looked ugly and amateur. Then he would call people out to job sites that were sometimes hours away for the smallest thing like a screw being found in the gravel that lined the driveway. Also he would get mad when my crewmate and I would refuse to do something unsafe, which would sometimes extend our job into the next day so that we could do it the safer, slower way.

&#x200B;

The official app peels like a port from the website. Like they just went ""stick the website on mobile and we'll just tweat it best we can"". A lot of the third party apps went for a mobile app that shows reddit content. If that makes sense.

When I was on baconreader (stopped working a few hours ago) I had it set up like Tinder. Swipe for next loading, don't have to go in and out of posts, subs nothing. Just next next next next next. It was also set up to autoload everything and hide things I hadn't read. So if I'm on a sub/front page, reddit for a while. Go and do something and come back, all the things I've seen are now hidden I don't have to go scrolling looking for unread stuff, everything is fresh and new. A contast thing is people saying ""this gif doesn't have sound"" then people replying ""oh click the thing to go to the site and it'll work"" taking you out the app, well it just played the sound.

You even been on the facebook app and then tried to use the mobile browser version? That's how it feels using the official app. Sure, it works. But it's not great. But I'm sure if you always used the mobile browser you think it's fine.",1688169667.0

I'm too busy laughing at such naivete to have time to try to ""prove"" anything to you or any other denier. 

>One thing that is racist is to give someone an edge

You're still missing the whole point of my initial comment, so I will reiterate: affirmative action is not a matter of being fair (or ""giving an edge"") to one particular individual. I understand why efforts to combat systemic racism looks like 'reverse racism' to racists, and as I suggested above, I am uninterested in trying to sort out their confusion. If you are interested in sorting out your confusion, then go do that instead of fruitlessly trying to trigger some sort of reticence on my part to not be either racist or confused about the issues.

>Which is why you arle being downvoted to hell and increasingly lashing out when you get proven wrong.

LOL. Recognizing the existence and impact of race in order to decrease bigotry is good. Refusing to recognize the existence and impact of race and bigotry is bad.

>Taking race into account in any way shape or form in official hiring or admissions process is immoral, racist, and illegal. And rightfully so.

So that's one vote for perpetuating the status quo of endemic, institutional, and systemic racism against Black Americans from u/lostboy289. Thxkbai",1688169667.0

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","this is a controversial take, but I think Riot marketing shot themselves in the foot by including new rigging and animation in their legendary+ price tiering.

That was fine when champs were made on a budget of 2 weeks and animation fidelity was limited, but new champ releases have a ton of work put into them, and I doubt animators want to downgrade the quality of their craft for the base champion so the legendary can look better in comparison.

That said, they can still make animations that look *different*. Or add additional features in base animation, like a wider variety of animations that can be played. Which is a huge letdown for recent legendaries.

As in terms of rigging and skinning, it’s even worse. The fact that they re-rigged old legendary skins meant that the original was rushed and simply not up to par for the animation quality they were aiming for. 

For rigging I think it’s fair to  instead add extra features on top of an existing rig rather than doing the entire thing from scratch just for the sake of it.",1688169668.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I'm not sure you do either. No offense, but my thinking is showgirls was a major motion picture. The only thing that gives it cult status is how bad it is and part of that is how funny it is to have been intended as a major motion picture but just gone off the rails. Probably because it was intended to be a measure motion picture. Films that are major studio films but bad so you watch them for that can be cult films, sure. But you can't really claim it's actually bad as if it doesn't deserve cult status. It literally is good because it's so bad.

Edit funnily enough I had a mtf unit idea semi similar to yours where basically their job was to handle portals that would appear around the world and would help cover up and explore these other dimensions and would help integrate the more human looking anomalies that don't intend to cause harm into society or the foundation. They would essentially be warned of a new doorway as I called them in an area they would have a fob set up from there they would check the energy signal coming from the portal if it's unknown they would send in specialized drones first in order to check what's on the other side and then go in themselves. I did also have it that they would be allowed to use some levels of anomalies as long as it was cleared by both the O5s and the ethics committee. I really need to rewrite this.",1688169670.0

First, I don't know what you mean by Western Turks? You mean Thrace Turks? They are similar, but not same. Greeks from Thrace have also Slavic component, while Thrace Turks usually lack that (unless they are from Bulgaria). 

Ethnicities cannot be just ""same"". They can be close, they can overlap, but that doesn't mean are ""just same"". 

If you mean all Turkish people from Western Turkey, then absolutely not. They share Anatolians as common ancestors, but all Turks here score some Turkic while Greeks don't have that. There is a big difference between Anatolia and Greece & Balkan. There is a reason ""Anatolian Turk"" coordinates exists in Illustrative DNA or Gedmatch results.",1688169671.0

Every person they share a table with and eat with is simultaneously contributing to the belief that what they’re eating is healthy, moral, and completely fine. 
It’s likely a spiritual, mental, and emotional defense reaction. 
If you learned something incredibly disgusting about yourself you’d be a little upset too. 
And the vast majority of human beings are on the side of eating meat and doing whatever the f*** they want despite the effects on future generations and the human race at large. 
But after a pretty quick search on the internet the appendix is a storage unit for bacteria for the large intestine it seems. So if they’re storing a lot of bad bacteria “IE” the kind that arises from eating cheese, milk, butter, eggs, and other food that is not supported by the digestive system of human beings, then of course it’s going to eventually die. Much like colon disease, breast cancer, immune system failure, brain degeneration, etc etc etc… 
Shit I mean stop feeding your plants specific nutrients for a while and they too will die. 
The body can only handle inflammatory foods for so long before the people themselves mutate into literal cancer cells themselves. 
Killing themselves and others around them. 

It’s pretty wild if you think about it from an evolutionary perspective. It’s a bacterial highjacking of the body, mind, and soul unfortunately. 
Those bacteria are literally parasitic bonds inside people telling them things so that they can eat.

You say that like it's any better. They're still used up women by that point. 

>That could be mitigated if we encouraged young marriage whilst also recognising that if it doesn't work out, that we should make it easier for them to continue having halal relationships. 

We should encourage young marriage and sustainable healthy relationships where women aren't working, manage domestic tasks, obey their husbands, and the husbands provide for their wives/are good to them. You know, what common sense and Islam encourage.

>Instead of encouraging thought patterns of ""I'm not ready for marriage because of the responsibilities so I'll just date casually""

"FanFiction","t5_2r5kb","Perfect world scenario, the two main questions are ""does it take anything away from the original depiction"" and ""does it add anything to what is already there for the character"".

If it DOES take something away, then is there something now replacing what was removed? If not, can't recommend it. If it ADDS something to what was already there for the character, what is being added? Is the addition tactful (i.e. not horrifyingly off-color, you know exactly what I mean), and is the addition meaningful? If yes to all of the above, then I say go for it.

Changes like that are best when intentional. Do it when there's purpose to it, otherwise someone WILL question it. Better to already have a decent answer, etc.",1688169672.0

"prowrestling","t5_2qhk0","Hello! Please do not use fatphobic phrases or words such as big. Hurtful language about body image can have significant negative impacts on an individual's mental health and self-esteem. It may also be triggering. When someone is subjected to derogatory comments about their appearance, they may begin to feel ashamed or embarrassed about their body, leading to feelings of low self-worth and poor body image. This can result in harmful behaviors such as disordered eating or excessive exercising to change their body in an attempt to conform to societal beauty standards. Moreover, hurtful language about body image can also contribute to the development of anxiety and depression, leading to long-term consequences on an individual's mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to promote body positivity and refrain from making negative comments about someone's appearance.

That's not what fun means to most people I know.

Mind you, if no raid wipes were caused by it, I generally wouldn't care, I've been trolled a couple times (never successfully) and in a sufficiently overleveled raid will just kill charmed people on purpose so no one wastes sleep bombs. But having everyone troll each other and needing to reset the gate 3 times because of it would be the exact opposite of ""fun"" for me, and I'd be very surprised to be in a raid like that.

You can also use it to pick the ball up off the ground at pretty low speeds if done well. Or just the usual wavedash-cut.

Along with your tip #2, learning how your car slides at different speeds, angles, under acceleration, while reversing, while counter steering, etc… can be very useful. Something to play around with is to hold powerslide and do a 180, but about halfway through reverse and counter steer. You should easily do a 360, which you can continue indefinitely. Change timing to change direction. This method pairs well with your tip #1 (for any landings), wavedashes, and half flips. 

You can also use the 360 method in weird positioning situations. You can pretty much rotate in place to hold your ground without committing to a jump. Or “cancel” your wavedash turn if a teammate gets a lucky 50/50 or an opponent whiffs as you were about to rotate.",1688169673.0

After trying to think of a more tame idea that'd be more happen to prone in real life, I realised that there are a lot of situations where people would wanna try things but just have no way of trying them and may feel more embarrassed to trying them, so I thought of a story of two friends which attend university together, the guy being much more focussed on his school work and settling for a career before going out and really caring about finding love, while the girl, while also smart and academic is a lot more outgoing and extroverted, this puts here in a situation where she ends up talking to a guy that she likes and that she knows is into her, and while the two of them have a lot of good cemistry when it comes to being friends, the girl has no idea on how to do practically anything intimate, this includes the basic standards of making out, having sex and other more erotic things that people do in university with their partners, this leads to her having no choice but going to her best friend and asking for help, in which they both decide that it's best for them to experiment on one another as it would be solely plantonic with no strings attached, which is what they thought, the more the experiments went on the more the two realsed that they were turning less and less into experiments, what started off as awkward kissing turned into countless nights together and the two ended up closer than ever, this is until both of them begin to second guess themselves and guilt begins to creep in. 

Other than that there is really nothing else I've got to add as that's all so far, as a foundation, I apologize that this is fairly vanilla but I enjoy both aspects of romance that being emotional and intimate, I don't mind much about writing style, and all I ask is that the RP be done on discord, if you are interested then let me know, if not, I wish you happy searching!

Feel free to admit you're wrong at any time.

And here is the text of it:

Hi I need a gut check to see if I'm being unreasonable here or not. My partner is not okay with the amount I've approved for her monthly discretionary spending? I handle all the finances as she's had spending problems in the past, and money stresses her out. No kids. The numbers are below:

Annual net household income of 114k, we each earn roughly half of that

Annual expenses approx: 12k(we've paid off our house and share a used vehicle)

Net Worth House is worth about 220k(no mortgage) and we have about 350k in investments saved for retirment.

I'm very focused on retiring early, and although she's on board for it, she's not okay with what it takes to get there. On her spending problems she had a lot of student debt before we got together 10 years ago. It was around 50k. I paid it off before we got married. In addition I also paid of a CC debt of around 1200 she had accumulated for a period where she was not working and upgrading her schooling.

Currently she's only allowed 15 dollars/month without talking to me about the expenditure, and says it's not fair and overly restrictive. AITA?

Edit: Because people have asked here is the context for her spending problems, basically she had been hiding away funds from me the past 2 years in a separate bank account and has spent the 6300ish she amassed over that time on hobbies and other stuff, so like 260/month on average.

She says it's because I was initially unreasonable with her discretionary limit(which to be clear she can spend more, we just have to discuss it so we're aware) of 15 dollars/month which has been in place for years now.",1688169674.0

The planet neptune is in you 6th house with the north node. The 6th house is all about you how you live, work in your day to day life and taking care of others.
Neptune can make you  feel dreamy and imaginative, but not so organised and to focus on the details. A structured daily routine is a must and also taking good care of your health holistically with exercise and diet. Avoid toxic substances such as drugs and alcohol! You may also be aware that neptune can be deceptive especially when it comes to realationships and dealing with people. You may be too generous and trusting, but you want to stay grounded and stay in touch with reality so you won't be taken advantage of or mislead.
 
In your aspects you have neptune trine your north node. The north node is about your fate in this life time. You may prosper in a creative career or have a big interest in spirituality and the occult. This is likely where you will meet people and make relationships.

"wallstreetbets","t5_2th52","It’s not a matter of them not being able to pay it off and therefore being “desperate” for loan forgiveness. It’s about the percentage of their life where they are impactful consumers in the economy. 

Take a lawyer for example. A lawyer doesn’t get hired at a law firm making $250,000 as a starting wage. An entry level position at a law firm will get you $50,000 to $80,000 per year. You don’t start making the big money until you buy into the partnership. It will cost anywhere from $50,000 to $200,000+ to buy into a partnership. Therefore, from the time you get hired until you become a partner, you are firmly middle class. The longer it takes you to pay off your student loans and buy into the partnership, the longer it takes you to become a significant consumer. Considering the student loans for a law degree can easily stretch into the $100,000 to $200,000 range, this delay between finishing school and becoming a partner is getting longer and longer, which results in lost economic potential.",1688169674.0

As a European man with an American fiancée (we both live in Europe right now), I have an interest in following this. How do you defend the fact that education is harder to get now?

"askgaybros","t5_2vgfw","You don't need an old person to answer this, you can ask a doctor too. The last section of the intestine is the anal canal and rectum. The body is designed to keep this part empty. So unless you have a very full colon and already have the urge to ""go"" even the longest dick will probably never hit anything. See for yourself, stick your finger in as deep as it'll go 100 times and see if you ever find anything on it. 

What's changed? People today have a different diet, especially in western countries, with far less fiber which promotes healthy bowels and firm solid bowel movements that leave no trace, so you can poop and then have sex with no worries. Mindsets also change, if you took your date out to dinner and then went home for sex and he pooped before, the world wouldn't end if there was a brown spot or a little smell during and after sex, it's anal sex for god's sake it can occasionally get messy and you both laughed about it later. 

Preparing for sex was getting all dressed up and trying to find the right guy. If you clicked and got lucky, you had sex and the vast majority of these anal encounters were disgust-free. Even rimming was OK in the time before douching, people liked man-smells and just wanted to have fun. Hope this helps!!!",1688169675.0

You can try but another external cases and put in that, though keep in mind a lot drives solder the boards to the drive meaning swapoing into another case is a no go.

You can open up the case to see. It shouldn't be too hard.

In the future it's best to buy the drive itself and a case to put it in. That way if the board on the case went out you're not SOL as you just buy another one.

The warn and noise just mean it gets power, and could be the board or the drive itself. Without trouble shooting it you won't know for sure. You coming here tells me you don't know much about that side of it.

SWVXX is the money market fund at Schwab I sweep cash into and it's paying out 4.9% these days (subject to changes in interest rates).  You could also buy T-bills to lock in ~5% for a set term, as well, through Schwab, and you might want to read up on bond ladders.

I don't know what your winners are vs your losers in terms of stocks but harvesting your losers and shifting the funds into index funds seems reasonable.  Then with any new money you put in keep pushing into the index side and over time the portfolio will balance out and eventually the indexes will move ahead.  It's harder to cash out of the winners, at least it is for me, I tend to let them run (and sometimes run back down too far down off their highs...).

If you do sell off the losers and shift into index funds read up on tax-loss harvesting.  Losses suck, but they can help offset capital gains in the same tax year and help you shift more quickly into index funds.",1688169676.0

"INTP","t5_2qhvl","I’ve journaled since I was a child. My mom has kept them all and says she’s going to give them to my children when they’re old enough to read. My mom (an Intj) journaled when she was a child too. From middle school to present she would give me a journal of hers to read when I was going through a hard time and needed to know I wasn’t  alone. My mom is not very sympathetic, it’s hard for her to deal with tears and other people’s emotions but in those journals were things she could never think to speak out loud. I partly journal to keep the tradition because I think it’s a really sweet tradition but I’m naturally pretty apathetic even though deep down inside I’m really empathetic. I’m also known to hold it all in until I finally explode. Journaling helps me understand and process emotions rationally so I can take a good look at what I’m really feeling, what’s the source of my feeling and how do I fix it. I don’t journal every day, sometimes I’m just neutral and I have nothing to really say, I go weeks or months without journaling at all (just like how I go months or even years without talking to my friends and then I’ll hit them up one day like nothing ever changed). Journaling is really whatever you want it to be, it’s just a clear calm way to interpret one’s emotions or really hone in and focus on improving writing. There’s no right or wrong way to do it.",1688169676.0

(I need. ten dollar word meaning dumb ass who realized too late views were wrong; that’s m. If I can shed my recidivist ways I might be able to save my marriage.) First step is to get comfortable with yourself. Second, really examine why body count is important and why it makes you feel insecure. 
  On a side note, Google searches are no replacement for actual professional advice. Good starting point but unless you’re a medical professional with a MD or PhD, it’s it guess work with limited information.

You have a relative who's sick, and dies due to waiting in line for a procedure. What horrible people decoded that was okay? This must be why one of the largest demographics for none elective procedures in my home state, are ironically Canadian... 

In regards to your assertions, they're  inaccurate and triggering. There are 10^¹²³ avanues that circumvent the need for foreclosure, and orders of magnitude more programs that offer assistance, financial aid, etc, etc. I have no idea where this myth that the Western medical system is destroying lives, but I suspect it's from a movie with Denzel. In 2017 my wife failed to yield while taking our children to school, and was subsequently T-Boned by a truck. Her and my youngest son were killed, our 8yr old was in a coma for 8 weeks, where he later circum to his injuries. I literally went millions in debt overnight, and other than the inexplicable pain of losing my entire family, the fees are more than manageable, with the vast majority being taken care of. My wife was originally from B. C. and I'm intimately familiar with Canada's complete shit system, so I have no idea why Canadians espouse it's magical, while literally legions of them flock to my home state, to circumvent the prolonged, Canadian wait times. 

Presumably his father was concerned over having a large debt, while desiring to retire, so overextended himself to pay off this debt. Unless you're in the top 1% of earners, the debt is MORE than manageable, for receiving the highest standard of care on tf planet.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13",">American officials had previously told The New York Times that they believed pro-Ukrainian groups were responsible for the Nord Stream attack. More recently, American officials have said that groups loosely directed by Ukraine’s government were responsible for a series of covert attacks, including on the Nord Stream pipelines.

>The intelligence report was based on information provided by a person in Ukraine, the Washington Post said, adding the CIA shared it with Germany and other European countries in June 2022.

>While officials acknowledged there was some early intelligence pointing to Ukraine, they said it was contradicted by other material, in essence saying they did not believe the European warning was a smoking gun.

After reading 3 different articles and the wikisite, i conclude that some group of ukrainian origin is the most probable saboteur, but first: nobody is sure and second: nobody knows if it was the ukrainian state or ukrainian ngo's* and there were still suspicious movents of Russian ships, capable of deploying submarines.
A boat was found with residue of lightweight explosives, wich was probably used by the ukrainians..
They rented it with fake passports and a ukrainian firm in Poland is supposed to have something to do with the een

>Even US intelligence has publicly admitted that Ukraine where responsible for it. You can't seriously still believe that Russia blew up their own damn pipeline?

Now tell me where your information comes from that states it definitely were Ukraine. Ofc it doesn't look good for Ukraine but there's lots of information we need that the investigation will provide.

Recreational pot, which has been nothing but a boon of tax dollars and has weird fringe benefits like reducing syphilis infections in states like Colorado, failed with a shocking majority of the vote even though there is a dispensary on every corner. OK has a much stronger community orientation and local identity than many places I've been and yet local politics follow state follow national in amplifying these problems. Ive had so. Many. Okies tell me that there isnt racism here and as long as someone is a good person who works hard and contributes they will be accepted and yet someone disembowelled a rabbit and left it smeared across the porch of my Black co-worker. I get that not every Okie is like that, most arent. But you know what they say about secrets dying in the light. Denying these things are real is keeping them in the dark. The issues you highlighted aren't things that are happening to OK, these are things OK is asking for when they go to the polls, when they talk about issues over lunch and common sense is too afraid to call out the bullshit, when the majority of organizing happening is angry facebook groups of grown adults with a singular mission to tell elementary schoolers where they can pee. 

I live here. I bought a house here. I'm not a tourist passing through going ""god this place is a shithole"" but I also recognize I don't have the history or ties to be able to tell okies why they do these things or what they should and shouldnt do. That's not my place. These are just observations from a social scientist outsider embedded in the culture and trying to do community development work across the state, so I see a lot first hand. I could 100% be wrong and I really wish I was. 

I'm more optimistic than many that OK isn't destined to stay a red pit because I do think the potential and low cost of living here will drive more younger folk in from the coasts which will bring fresh blood and help. That's my hope at least. Everytime I try to hope though some new awful thing happens here to call my bluff. And we won't get into how much I've been trying to sell this place to other educated young professionals with no luck or the slight taint I took on in my professional circle for *willingly* moving here.

And yes, the flags of many nations represent traitors at some point. Thank you for agreeing.

Clearly the OP used traitor as an insult, as if being a traitor is an objectively negative thing.  He basically said fuck people who commemorate traitors…now maybe he hates the US or the US flag, but I got a hunch he’s celebrating the 4th of July next week…a holiday that commemorates the traitors who rebelled against the British.  The reasons for the rebellion is irrelevant…they were still traitors and were seen that way by Britain and their fellow British who were loyal to the crown.

He could have said, flying a flag to commemorate people who were proponents of the institution of slavery in America…but no, he said traitors….",1688169679.0

Simply refusing to invest the enery to get agitated and just allowing the experience to do its ""worst"" out of deliberate curiousity rather than automatic fear or outrage can override the fight or flight response when it's not appropriate or necessary. Create that opportunity for choice to ""not do"", in the Taoist sense.

Also mentally stepping aside, almost as an objective observer of ourselves, by using fearful instinctive reactions as an opportunity to examine and question those reactions seems to also defang the fear response to tame anxiety in the moment rather quickly.

It's also an interesting way to handle nightmares and often resolves them into a more constructive storyline. Rather than being terrified, you sort of just go with it and mentally say ""that's wild, let's see how this story plays out and take something useful away from it"". Easier said than done, but it sometimes works when becoming fully lucid and breaking character doesn't seem to.",1688169679.0

I was also the co-leader (a producer) of a theatre club (Rude Mechanicals) my senior year of college! Met tons of friends, pushed myself out of my comfort zone, and had a creative outlet when not doing school stuff. I was also involved in RC Players, which was entirely student-run and funded from donations. That group was very casual and the main goal was to have fun working together to put together a show from scratch. While I did act in some shows, being on-stage is only one of the ways you can get involved, and I spent most of my time on the production team behind the scenes, working on organization, sets, planning, and smoothing the path for other people to do what they do best. I think most groups are open to anyone that is genuinely interested, and while you might not get cast as the lead in a show off the bat, they will find a way for you to be involved and contribute.

"sweden","t5_2qofe","Det handlar om att supermoderatorer inte längre kommer kunna vara moderatorer i långt fler subreddits än de egentligen borde vara. Detta beror på att automationen som dessa moderatorer förlitar sig på kräver tillgång till Reddits API, vilken otillgängliggörs idag.

De pådrivande moderatorerna gjorde vilseledande påståenden om att de ”protesterade” för att alternativa appar till Reddits officiella kommer försvinna, men den egentliga anledningen är alltså att moderatorernas makt på Reddit kommer minska.

Det främsta beviset på att det enbart handlade om moderatorernas maktbegär, och inte om användarnas upplevelse, var att alla moderatorer på hela jävla Reddit omedelbart öppnade upp sina subreddits när Reddit gjorde det klart att de skulle förlora sina moderationsbefogenheter om de inte gjorde det. Moderatorerna var alltså endast villiga att uppoffra sina medlemmar och deras upplevelse till förmån för ändamålet, men de var inte villiga att uppoffra någonting själva.

I was right where you are. Down to the anxiety and depression. Sadly, most of the time bullies bully just to bully, or because they're miserable with themselves and feel the need to take it out on someone else. 

I never did anything to the kids who teased me, too. I was just an easy target I guess. If things get too hard to handle, please don't hesitate to reach out to your support systems. And way, way easier said than done, but whatever those kids are teasing you about? I guarantee you it's coming from a place of unhappiness deep within themselves. 

I know that doesn't help with the teasing, but it's a good thing to keep in mind. Their words are coming from either a dark place, or a nasty one. Some kids are just mean, others are struggling and wrongfully taking it out on those around them. 

Either way (no matter why they're teasing you), you don't deserve it, kiddo. You don't deserve to be teased, and whatever it is they're saying? Don't let them get to you. Every time they say something nasty or unkind, think of something about yourself that you like. Whether it be a talent, something physical, how you handle yourself, something about your personality, anything. Just make sure to give yourself a compliment and some love. 

Always combat unkind words from others with kind thoughts to yourself. Treat yourself kindly. Once you're done with school, you can say goodbye to those kids forever. You just gotta make it through school, and again I am so happy to hear you have a good support system. That'll definitely make it easier. :)",1688169682.0

I don't presume to know why people would be buying AMC - which is guaranteed to lose value after the consolidation with APE - instead of buying APE. Or both, as the gain in value of APE will more or less offset the loss in AMC if you own 2 APEs for every 1 AMC you own. 

Frankly, the best play might be to have AMC and allow it to be lent out since the borrow fees on AMC are insane right now, or to sell covered calls which are  never going to hit, as option premium is high as well. Those could offset any losses you might endure in the post-split.

"jobs","t5_2qhnd","I have an extremely irrelevant degree but had 5+ years professional experience in general (graphic design, mostly freelance). I’m in programmatic advertising which you would only learn in college if you somehow already knew it’s what you wanted to get into and were at a school with a media program and even then it would be unlikely. I’ve only ever had one intern who had taken a programmatic specific course. I never even used excel prior to this job - just learn how to use a pivot table so you can say you do in an interview. That’s the most advanced thing you’d need to know and no one I’ve trained/hired has ever used them before.

That said you could get any similar job (paid search, paid social, SEO, media planning) without any relevant background on paper. Just do the bare minimum research (trust me that’s more than most I’ve interviewed can manage) and don’t be dipshit on your resume and during your interview.

Publicis, IPG, WPP, Omnicom, Dentsu - these are the 5 largest media agency groups in the world and have tons of agencies under them. There are always entry level positions. Depending on your clients you can have a very different experience than I described. I worked over 60 hours a week for 9 months before I quit my previous agency for a different one. YMMV, but those shitty experiences at least make for a lot of open positions and opportunity for you. Get in, learn, quit or transfer internally.

Edit: I’ve also been fully (FULLY) remote since February 2020. My home office isn’t even in the state where I live. There is an office in my major city, but I don’t even know where it is",1688169683.0

Ano passado fiz uma amizade com dois colegas de turma, já os conhecia mas não tinha nenhuma afinidade e aconteceu de ficarmos mais próximos, e esse dois eram péssimos nos estudos e no final do ano os dois ficaram de recuperação (esperado). Tinha combinado com um desses amigos (ele vai se chamar peixeiro) de e fazer as recuperações dele (ao contrário deles, eu estudo muito) por um preço obviamente. 
O peixeiro e eu desenvolvemos interesses um no outro, só que o peixeiro queria algo mais sério e eu não. Eu fiz a recuperações dele, ele passou de ano, me agradeceu e disse que ia me pagar em um certo dia. Ok

E passou e passou ele não me pagou. Chegou no momento e percebi que ele tava tendo um interesse demais em mim, então fui clara com ele e disse que não tava interessada mas que seria ótimo continuarmos amigos. 

O problema é que depois disso ele passou a me ignorar e só fala comigo por tabela, e adivinha? Ele não me pagou. E diz que não vai pagar de jeito nenhum (ouvi de uma colega em comum).

"TrueUnpopularOpinion","t5_lrajx","Take a loan, loan accrues interest overtime, meaning that already sizable chunk of change has more cash to it. Hope you can get a good paying job right off the bat and pay down the debt as fast as possible assuming that your cost of living is zero or less than $5k because enough live with your parents and still it will take you years. 

I graduated with $31.5k in debt total. Parents luckily were paying off the yearly interest while I was in school, which was an in-state tuition school I had scholarship money to and $15k per year from a fund my grandparents set up, Covid happened so I paid reduced tuition and no housing costs AND I moved off campus my junior year so I wasn’t paying housing costs and was on a $1k per semester meal plan (normal is $3.8k. Now I’m extremely lucky that I can live with my parents and I got hired to a job right away that paid ~$75k so I will be able to pay in about 12-18 months after paying taxes and such. 

$31.5k in debt still after all those lucky breaks, and not paying it back in a timely manner (a lot of people take  10-20 years to pay it off) fucks with your credit score which also effects interest rates on future loans by, spoiler alert, making it more expensive to take loans in the future. It is absolutely predatory because it’s charging Everest sums of money on credit to people with no credit history, and even if they go to state schools with scholarship money and do everything else right STILL have to pay that mountain of debt. 

Life is seldom as simple as “just pay it back” because you aren’t just paying the basic cost of of the loan but also the interest on it and it screws you overtime by making any other credit or loan payments in the future that much more expensive. As much as it would like it to be as simple as the world you live in, that’s not reality. Come in with an actual argument instead of making an ass of yourself",1688169684.0

"bronx","t5_2ruo6","Oxford English Dictionary:

**gen·tri·fi·ca·tion**  
noun  
**1.** the process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, **typically displacing current inhabitants in the process.**  
  
**2.** the process of making someone or something more refined, polite, or respectable.  


Gentrification is essentially new age colonization. What happens during gentrification is that developers come into poorer under-resourced neighborhoods and began rehabbing abandoned homes. Then they charge an arm and a leg for rent/sale; which means that usually only people with more money than the locals can move into these nicer places. 

As the process goes, the wealthier people want nice things so we see new businesses opening up that cater to these people who have higher disposable incomes. Once we see these new businesses come in, we see more people coming in. Those people need places to live so we see more homes being bought and flipped, apartment buildings being rennovated and new-constructions going up. Again, all of these are costing more than is typical in the neighborhood. It starts to become painfully obvious that these things are generally not for the locals who probably can't afford, or if they can just don't want to pay these absurd prices to live where they have been for generations. So as time goes on these people are forced to leave or pay the high rent, more people leave as they than stay.

 Some places don't even rehab, they just jack up the rent on tennants because they can.  Property taxes go up, and if they don't raise the rents they end up selling to developers who continue the process. 

In my home city, Philadelphia, developers actually force people to sell through legal (sometimes actual illegal) harassment and threats, or by straight up tricking older people. 

Many, but not all, of the people who move in, the transplants ***(and I'm speaking as a transplant myself)*** come from places that are different to the neighborhoods they move to. They expect everything to change to fit them, they use police to attack people they don't like, especially people of color, and they make it a point to seperate themselves from the locals who built the neighborhood. They pretend it's to get rid of crime, and make things safer, but in reality all they're doing is helping the developers get rid of anyone who doesn't have the money to throw at the new properties. IMO there is nothing wrong with transplants moving in, as long as they assimilate and respect the people who have been there the whole time. Which is what I plan to do. We arent special and don't deserve special treatment, we should become part of the neighborhood and help make it better for every, not be selfish and only care about our own interests.

A lot of peopple only pay attention to the second definition of the word, pretending that gentrification is just to help everyone by making things nicer. But the truth is that gentrification doesn't help anyone, even people who can afford it initially start to suffer as time goes on and prices continue to rise on real estate because of ""supply and demand"". In the end, the only people who truly benefit from it are developers. It's not just bad, it's horrific.",1688169684.0

"Methadone","t5_2sz9e","So if your brother has been on it for 10 years, it will take 5 years at least to taper. Methadone is an extremely strong, long-acting medicine, so it will take a long time to taper if and when he's ready. I understand you love your brother, but it sounds like you don't have any experience with opiate or methadone treatment. It's true that you don't really understand unless you've lived it yourself. Some people feel they want to be on it their whole lives. I got on it at age 22 after all other options had been exhausted. I'm 33 now, I've been on it for 11 years, so to answer your question, being on it 10 years is normal. I would say 150 is a high dose, but that's the dose he felt is right for him. You can't do anything about that. It's his body, his choice. I'm gonna be honest, after being on 150 for 10 years, he won't be able to find an equivalent of pills for thar dose unless you want him taking like 50+ pills a day. 
As far as taper, it's taken me 2.5 years to go from 165 mg to 91 mg. It's been a slow and bumpy ride. I know it's probably going to take another 3 years to get to 0 mg. If you have any more questions or just need someone to talk to with methadone experience, you can always talk to me. Much love ❤️",1688169685.0

So basically, yesterday I heard from somewhere online that studies have shown that the sweetener aspartame could potentially cause cancer. I immediately thought of my girlfriend because I know she drinks Diet Coke often and that contains aspartame. So me being a little paranoid about health stuff, I told her that I heard that and she responded saying “oh I’ve known that forever, that’s not gonna stop me from drinking Diet Coke tho <3” which made me feel like she didn’t care whether or not it could cause bad things to happen. 

So I told her I didn’t want her to risk her health and why consume it if there’s a possible risk? She responded by saying the chances are really low and whatnot, which is fine I understand that, but when I kept trying to explain that I was just trying to help and was concerned about it initially, but she responded with some hostility and was saying it was stupid and that misinformation upsets her. I reassured her that I didn’t know if it was 100% true so I used words like “potentially” and I just wanted to make sure she was aware of the possibility, but she just kept getting more and more upset. 

I explained how I felt that she was making it seem as though she didn’t care about if it was dangerous before, and she continued to respond with hostility saying it was annoying and stupid. She said how it bothered her that I told her “misinformation about something she’s educated in”, and I responded by telling her I didn’t know she knew about it before and I was just trying to help, but she said it wasn’t the point. 

So, I asked what the point was because I have a hard time thinking clearly during conflicts, they make me anxious. From there, she responded with “idc” to anything I said. After a few minutes of this, I told her I understood that she was upset but communication is still important and I really didn’t mean to upset her but I’m sorry that I did. 

She said “idc” again so I said I knew she still cared about me and and my feelings, to which she replied with “nah”. I was upset, and I probably should’ve responded differently but I said “uh huh, you’re just saying that because you’re mad at me.” She said I was talking down to her and told me to f off. I told her I was sorry and didn’t realise it came across that way, and all she said was “don’t speak to me.” She’s reading my messages but hasn’t responded in a while. AITA?

**Buyers and sellers, use the link above to verify where to redeem codes to ensure 4K codes redeem properly.**

**Feedback Logging (*Does not apply to GIVEAWAYS*)**

* Once a trade has been completed, one user (doesn't matter if OP or not) must create a comment (can be in-line with the trade discussion) tagging both `DCTbot` and the user they transacted with, for example u\/juansolo298.
 * The u/ is required.
* Once this is done, the tagged user must respond to that comment for feedback to be logged.
* If successful, the bot will respond to the second comment with ""Added"", and the number will increment for both.

All discussions/negotiations about a potential trade must be made via comments. Exchange codes via PM or Reddit Chat. This helps to prevent scams and track trusted traders. **DO NOT RESPOND TO OFFERS MADE VIA PM OR CHAT.**

* If you believe you have been scammed, please [fill out this form](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=r/uvtrade&subject=I%20Think%20I%20Have%20Been%20Scammed&message=*%20Username%20of%20the%20person%20scamming%20me:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20the%20thread%20where%20the%20transaction%20originated:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20Link%20to%20screenshots%20uploaded%20to%20imgur%20of%20my%20conversations%20with%20the%20scammer:%20%0D%0A%0D%0A*%20An%20explanation%20of%20the%20situation:%20).

And as a PMC I typically run with ether a PPSH or an SKS  if I'm not running the AK-74U 

- making gun builds is still fun in the game and you can still go for rule of cool with your builds, just because someone has a gun with good stats dosnt mean they automatically win the fight you can out play the person with better positioning and knowing when and where to be aggressive or to back off.

-recoil isn't that bad it's actually in a very balanced state in my opinion. not everything needs to be a laser beam like it was waaaay back in the day and again the PPSH was a shit weapon that you could barely hit anything past 10 meters, right now I would say the recoil we have now has made it serviceable at 20 meters tops on full auto and I think it's now a pretty good smg now personally.

- In terms of lighting I feel that as a whole is 100% an opinion based thing so sure I personally have little issue with it but if you do that's fine.

- Audio I'll agree is something that's been broken for awhile but I find I've have minor issues but again other people have a lot of issues and it's a known thing so I agree the audio needs to be fixed. 

-I'll agree that locking things behind quests is kinda dumb and there are some items where I'm like... why is this a locked item but as someone who dosnt run meta gear most things I can unlock by level like level 26-27 and I'm done leveling there is only one thing that's like quest required and that's the PST ammo for my PPSH like it's typically all early quest stuff.

I don't run meta and I rarely feel left behind or at a disadvantage  but I do agree I don't like where say I want something but it's behind 5 different quests 

- you can still play tarkov how you want... hi I'm one of those people 

- I don't quite understand your issue on the risk vs reward system I agree that the found in raid system is kinda eh compared to before but I don't see it as a big deal personally but I think I understand and agree with the sentiment you're trying to make.

-for scaving I understand your point but scav runs are fun and they're a good way for more casual players to just go in play a raid and then maybe do something else. There are people on the sub who hate scav runs with a passion but personally I don't see the argument. Because who cares if someone has millions of rubles it dosnt effect your gameplay at all, if someone wants to money farm and just play the game and not worry about money... let them, it's not going to make them any harder to kill and really those players who focus scav runs if they do decide to do a kitted out PMC run they're a free loot pinata because they're not practicing pvp or even killing scavs half the time so cool free loot I just don't understand that argument of ""it's free money and free gear"" well the gear you typically have is shit and the money dosnt effect anyone but the player who has it so let them be, if you don't want to do scav runs then just don't, simple as that. 

Last thing I want to talk about is the flea... I still love the flea but I agree found in raid put a dampener on that but at the same time  when I find something found in raid I'm like ooooo I'm excited to sell this  

But yea this comment is long but so was your post so I mean there's some things I agree with some I don't.",1688169690.0

"CPS","t5_2srim","I have a story for you that you may find solace in.

When I was a child, my dad was with a really abusive alcoholic. Like we were talking, she would demand to have intercourse with my dad and claim SA afterward. My dad tried his best to keep her away from me and my 2 younger siblings, but her children would abuse us with her. 

My mom called CPS, and after 3 years of suffering, my siblings and I were removed from the home and interviewed by CPS. They gave my mom emergency custody through the state for 6 months while they investigated and told my dad that he could pick us up for school and doctors appointments, and that was about it AFTER she assaulted a CPS worker drunk. She tried kidnapping my siblings and I from our schools several times, and eventually, CPS put a restraining order against her, telling her she couldn't be around us or talk to us until we were 18. 

The degree of abuse varied on what she drank. If she drank wine, she would beat us with the bottles. If she drank beer, she was verbally violent. If she drank whiskey, she would beat herself up or throw herself down the stairs and claim my dad beat her when my dad was nowhere around her. If she drank sake, she was extremely physically violent. 

Most likely what would happen with you is that you get full custody because he isn't responding to CPS and CPS in RARE cases will force the other parent to pay child support if one parent had full custody with no visitation.",1688169691.0

*Instead of answering, Mazu bade him to bow down in reverence.  No sooner had Shui-liao bowed down than Mazu stamped him to the ground.  Curiously enough, Shui-liao, was enlightened right on the spot.*

*Rising up, he clapped his hands and laughed aloud, saying, ""How marvellous! How marvellous!  Hundreds and thousands of Samadhis and innumerable spiritual insights have their root and source in the tip of a feather!""  After bowing once more in reverence, he retired.  When Shui-liao became an abbot, he often told his assembly, ""Ever since I received Mazu’s stamping, I have never ceased to laugh.""*

Comment: I made this comment after another user made a false and misleading claim above regarding enlightenment, and I'm ad-libbing, but they said something along the lines that all ""enlightenment experiences are seen as ordinary and mundane and as nothing special by those that have attained enlightenment.""

The user, whose name I can't exactly recall but it begins with 'Eastern' and has been following me around to try to prove me wrong in some way on every post recently, then promptly deleted the comment in embarrassment once he was proven one hundred percent wrong here.  If anyone knows any way to somehow view a deleted comment on Reddit, please feel free to share it here and it would be greatly appreciated.  People like that should be regarded with caution, because they're unknowingly operating purely in ego and thus tend to constantly spread delusion and ignorance.

Delusions and misinformation surrounding enlightenment are common and I'm used to correcting any misunderstandings based on my actual study of the subject in good faith, but I find it entirely disingenuous and deceptive to not let such a comment stand so everyone else could see where he was in error once he was directly proven wrong by myself and even others.",1688169694.0

>  
>Those aren't historical in any way, but still very popular.

Because it is a massive change that offers a huge noticeable practical difference in capacity and gets to attract people who always never bought a 1911 simply because of capacity (perhaps the number one negative I see people say). Even 1911 haters admit the gun feels good, they just hate capacity. Even having the Glock mag options sort of shows they are trying to reel in people who have Glocks/Sigs and always say ""I'd never buy a 1911 because single stack mags."" The 1911 traditional lovers also want one because they get to buy a double stack that has a familiar feel. They don't need to get ""that damn polymer junk"" to finally be on par in capacity.

>Talk about a 1911 using a barrel like a SIG or Hi Power:

The thing is, nobody, atleast the layman in the gun market, cares about barrel lug design or links. That doesn't attract the people who otherwise dislike the 1911 being an old, heavy, single stack. The people who dislike the single stack 1911 wouldn't care about those changes.

The people who like the single stack 1911 like it because it is what it is (muh history). And even if they were willing to consider this new option, they probably wouldn't see the point of buying as your criteria only really has one in-hand user noticeable change which is the grip safety. What you propose won't convince either party to drop $1k+ over their Glock or over their traditional 1911. The gun market doesn't have your brain that cares about the more minute details.

I'm not hating on what you want in a 1911. I'm just saying there probably isn't a big enough draw for manufacturers to trip over themselves trying to make it. Which is probably why no one bothered or will bother.",1688169694.0

This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

Napoleon fought 80+ battles and won nearly all of them. He was consistently outnumbered throughout the entire time but managed to also consistently outmaneuver the enemy army and win his battles very decisively (as in, he had an army twice as small but manage to inflict triple the casualties. That happened many, many times, actually - I'm not exaggerating).

Napoleon is famously considered by nearly every historian as a military genius and (one of) the best army commander(s) in history.

France was by far the strongest military in the world during that era (in big part due to his strategies) and was only defeated when literally the entire Europe worked together to finally defeat him - saying that he ""surrendered twice"" is a very disingenuous take for anyone with even a modicum of knowledge on the subject (which the guy above has, since he knew quite a bit of details).",1688169695.0

"Ayahuasca","t5_2s8ss","I understand. I could only imagine the suffering you've gone through. 
I by no means mean to downplay your experience and as others might have interpreted, bypassed your pain. 

The hope you asked for is in the life you believe you can have. If your beliefs are debilitating, no one will ever be able to save you. You are in control of your life and it sounds as if you have lost that control due to your experiences of fear and trauma. 

The reason I said what I said is because I know the truth of who you are, which is enlightened love. The persona you've created, consciously or unconsciously, through your experiences might not be in alignment with this truth, however that doesn't take the essence of who you are away from you. It only reveals itself out of the harmony or disharmony in your life.

I find it discomforting that the world we live in sees the reflection of hope, in the spirit of allowing someone to reflect on a possible future where they are happy, content, and filled with gratitude, as a bypass and something that's considered unnecessary pressure. 

I believe that you can do anything you want to do. I understand that it can be quite difficult to reprogram beliefs, however it's not impossible. It's simply a matter of putting in the time and energy to train ourselves to think differently. 

Most people in this world don't want to take this type of responsibility. They want there to be someone to blame for the life they're living. The truth is that you're creating all of this because the truest self of you is all of this. 

I know you can begin to make micro changes in your thinking routine that can help bring you towards a future you want to be a part of. When you get to that future, I trust you'll be in a situation to look back on your life as necessary and even feel grateful for all of it. These are all choices that you can consciously make to direct your life with intention. 

If I could recommend anything to you, it would be to read the book The Master Key System by Charles Hannel. Take the time to do the exercises and regain control of your mind. 

It may feel daunting to realize that this is all part of your reality and that your subconscious has created this through your level of awareness. However freedom lies within the truth. 

I wish you peace and happiness and true healing in every way, shape, and form. I truly believe in you because you are already Whole, Perfect, Strong, Powerful, Loving, Harmonious, and Happy. ❤️

Blessings to you as the blessing you are.",1688169696.0

"antiwork","t5_2y77d","I understand the frustration tbh. 

I’m debt free for a number of reasons, no siblings, family was able to prioritize assisting me with college over other purchases, etc. not everyone has those advantages and I understand that. 

However, I also made a lot of sacrifices to save money. I went to a state school rather than the Ivy that I qualified for, I couldn’t afford it. I never took vacations, I worked through much of school, lived very frugally etc. Those sacrifices were meaningful, especially not getting the Ivy degree, and it would be galling if people who irresponsibly borrowed money so they could have those things got that debt forgiven. If I’d felt comfortable taking 6 figures of debt as a 19 year old, I would’ve gone to Cornell, I would've taken vacations, and been able to work unpaid internships, and probably would be well ahead in life relative to where I am now, with better memories of youthful adventure or whatever. 

That said, the student debt crisis is ridiculous, and we have to do something. My solution is just to forgive all the debt, and then give everyone else debt-free a similar amount as a check. We can’t let everyone be choked under this debt, but we shouldn’t punish people for sacrificing in the name of financial responsibility.",1688169696.0

"PurplePillDebate","t5_2ya42","I’m sure the majority of people on this sub with these sorts of opinions just like to pretend to be a rapist on the internet, but I always wonder how many are actually the real thing.   
   
Anyways, like it or not, men using their superior strength to take advantage of the women they want is bad for everyone. Women of course, but also men. Most non-sociopathic men have female family members/children/friends that they care for, and when those women suffer the men who care for them also experience negative emotions. It also creates a lot of potential for upset and social tension- if you decide to use your superior strength to take advantage of another man’s wife, and he decides to get a gun and come shoot you, that’s not a great outcome for anybody. How do you imagine things will run smoothly in the real world if you see your waitress, or your kids‘ preschool teacher, or your neighbor and decide to use your superior strength to take advantage of them?  


It is obviously in the best interest of everyone who is not a sociopathic rapist to work together to shun and punish those who have sociopathic rapist tendencies.",1688169696.0

It's a matter of not doing something that your partner is not comfortable with. Most people are not comfortable with being in a non-exclusive relationship with someone. Specially when it's been that long you dated.

If she is fucking around, this just mean either she is dumb or she doesn't care about your relationship.

If she cared about your feelings she would have clarified this point with you. I doubt that she really tought you had no problem with this.

On other hand, I guess is a good practice to set your relationship boundaries from the get go, as what is cheating can be a bit different for every person.

And that's before riveting so even without rivets, mine have always fit really tight.

- Starting of by deciding to do a full trilogy with no plan and singular vision behind it.

- Having a golden, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have almost all of the original cast return, only to waste them on a deconstruction that was purposefully made to be polarising.

- Having ANOTHER golden opportunity with the stars of the Prequels returning, only to waste them on a show that was middling at best, and almost completely forgotten months later. Probably should have hired someone who had actually SEEN Episode 3 to write your Obi-Wan show, Disney. 

- Having a hit with the Mandalorian, only to throw away two seasons of solid storytelling and emotional payoff in a spin-off show, with a third season that just repeated the second season’s story beats and brought back the old villain because reasons. 

- Continually attack fans that criticise these decisions by throwing generalised racism and sexism accusations based on a few YouTubers or tweets with double or sometimes single-digit followers lmao. It’s creating this narrative that only “alt-right grifters and fascists” are fuelling the hate for these movies, which gullible wannabe-activists are falling for.

"whowouldwin","t5_2s599","Hoplites smoke the Walkers. They are heavily armoured and fight with large shields as a unit, making it very difficult for the Walkers to get any attack in. Their long spears are not the best possible melee weapon for killing a Walker but nevertheless can do so, while also holding them at a distance. The hoplite also can employ their short sword at close range for insta-kills. This is not a close fight, zombies get rekt.

Bonus: without infection, the Hoplites smoke the Crossed. Crossed are as fast as humans but usually much stupider. Many of them are incapable of even using firearms, meaning they have clubs, hatchets and knives against elite armoured infantry. Once again, zombies get rekt.

You would need a Crossed ambush directed by an intelligent Crossed such as Horsecock, *with* infection and preferably some firearm using Crossed, in order to make this a fair fight.",1688169700.0

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","I could describe to you what putting your toes in the pool feels like couldn't I? It's cool. Ite relaxing. The cool breeze is refreshing and calming. The sun is warm. Maybe it burns? 

But did you feel any of those feelings? No. You didn't. Because feeling something and describing feeling something are inherently different. 

So a trans woman could describe feeling like a woman, and you might go ""yeah but that's bullshit, I've never felt that."" And that's kinda the point? If you had felt it, your not only understand but you'd be trans yourself. 

But you don't feel it do you? Because you aren't trans. And both of those experiences are totally okay. 

What isn't okay is thinking you know what someone else is going through without being in their shoes. 

But if we absolutely must, my friend who is trans has described the feeling as this: nothing. At least now that she's out. Before she realized she was trans there was this inherent feeling that something about her experience was wrong. Like she just felt bad about herself her body, she didn't recognize herself in the mirror. I believe this feeling is called gender dysphoria, which has symptoms that you can look up.",1688169700.0

Confronting her is difficult. Meth is one of those addicting drugs that's kind of... ""on the edge"".... where maybe you can get better, but maybe not....

"Stoicism","t5_2r4kq","I think you have to be wise what you consume, and where you spend your online time

I have a rift from a family member, and I did tryout the applicable Reddit sub but it overwhelmed me.  So much sorrow, so little positivity, so much wallowing.   Now likely  people go there to vent, and having posted out there to the Redditverse, many of them maybe leave it at that and get on with their day.  But it was not a helpful place for me, and I haven't been back there.

Some of these online communities can be frequented by people who post in their distress when they can't sleep or if they have drunk too much or whatever.   That is all they are, even if people say they are looking for advice they are not always, they are just venting.  Maybe like your post is?

My take would be - make yourself strong (this is a Stoicism sub, so naturally I would point you towards Stoic resources which are actually super helpful), then if you decide you really want to help people be Wise in what you do.  Perhaps help a neighbour or someone in your family or community, offer skills to your community or volunteer where you can.   If you think you have comments that you can usefully offer, tap into one of these communities in a measured way and maybe reply positively to one or 2 people.  It is not appropriate to reply to everyone, or to take on board their issues personally.   Sometimes just a little guidance or a pointer, even an ""I hear you"" can be just the thing.",1688169702.0

"kindafunny","t5_2vhlq","*Breath of the Wild* is a fantastic first Zelda game, as it changes up the formula by going fully open world and doesn’t require you to have any prior knowledge of the series (although most of the games are standalone stories anyways). That said, here are the games I would recommend as essentials (in no particular order):

- *The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild* (and *Tears of the Kingdom* if you want more afterwards)

- *Super Mario Odyssey*

- *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe*

- *Celeste* (if you haven’t played it on PlayStation)

- *Super Smash Bros. Ultimate*

If you like retro games or online multiplayer as well, I’d highly recommend signing up for Nintendo Switch Online. NSO gives you access to a library of NES, SNES, and GameBoy games, and if you get the NSO Expansion Pak you also get N64, GBA, and Sega Genesis. NSO also gives you some great freebies like *Tetris 99*, which is also a top recommendation.

Here’s a few games I would recommend but are more down to if you’re interested or if you enjoy the games listed above:

- *Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury* (great 3D Mario that uses more of the 2D games’ style. Great for single player or up to 4 players)

- *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* (if you like or are interested in Pokémon)

- *Metroid Prime Remastered* (remake of an FPS metroidvania classic)

- *Mario Party Superstars* (the best Mario Party on Switch)

- *Dead Cells* (if you haven’t played it on PlayStation)

- *Cuphead* (if you haven’t played it on PlayStation)

- *Hades* (if you haven’t played it on PlayStation)

Also if you want more classic Zelda experiences, there’s a few options you could check out.

- **2D:** *Link’s Awakening* got a remake on Switch, or you can play the original *Link’s Awakening* and *A Link to the Past* on NSO.

They gave businesses the right to refuse requests for customized orders.

>Example: I make wedding websites. Each website is unique. I don’t believe gay marriage is moral. I can choose to not accept requests to create gay-themed sites. 

Or, to further simplify:

>I sell paintings of fish and accept commissions. You ask me to paint a turtle. I can say “no, sorry, I really only paint fish”

And yes I am gay fwiw. The woman in this case who refused to make a gay wedding website does indeed sound like a bigoted homophobe. However, it is perfectly within her rights to be one.

If they didn’t rule in her favor, it would almost imply that anybody can request anything, no matter how vile and contrary to their beliefs the subject matter is. You could have a white supremicist force a Jewish baker to make a nazi-themed wedding cake, for example.",1688169703.0

"msp","t5_2slwq","I firmly believe our job is to empower end users to accomplish their tasks, not complete those tasks on their behalf. With that being said, I probably would have done the same thing you did.

I also work for an MSP that manages surveillance systems for some of our clients.

For those clients, we have designated employees with view only access to the live feed  (each employee has their own login credentials for auditing purposes). If there is a need to download videos, we take care of that for them, and it is documented in a service ticket.

It sounds like your organization doesn't have a designated person (or department)  responsible for the surveillance system, so by default, the system was assigned to I.T. (""It's a tech thing, right?"" - Some Manager, probably.). I recommend fixing this first.

If your department is (eventually) tasked with maintaining the surveillance system, I have a few recommendations:

1. Segment the surveillance system from the rest of the network (VLANs are your friend!)

2. If your users don't have individual accounts, create them now (with MFA, if available).

3. If your users have the ability to delete camera footage, either remove this attribute (Check with management first!) and/or confirm their actions are logged.

Good luck!

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","#uh oh, reddit had a fucky-wucky because you are using it too much~

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

"movies","t5_2qh3s","In real life the adoptive parents were far less savior figures. Michael was already good at football, and he wasn't a functionally illiterate child like gentle giant. Michae oher in real life worked really hard to better himself and look out for himself and was a capable kid even before he was taken in by his adoptive family, they didn't shape his football career nearly as much as the movie portrayed, and he really disliked how they portrayed him as intellectually deficient. They also portrayed his football skills as him being naturally gifted with little effort, he had to be molded by others to succeed, whereas in reality he had to work really hard of his own volition to get to that point. He did get a lot of guidance and mentorship, but it was more a wide variety of coaches and teachers over the years who influenced and encouraged him vs a few key savior figures like in the film. 

Oher stated that the movie made his life harder for him, particularly professionally, because it gave him the reputation that he was an intellectual dullard but an amazing football savant, and neither of those things were true. 

So overall, that movie diminished the personal efforts and achievements of a poor black kid to make some nice rich white people (who already come off well in the REAL story) look even better.",1688169704.0

If they can manage to pull off the 40k one, a good ME live action is 100% possible as long as all people with say in it are invested in the source material.

If the 40k one doesn't go that well then my ME attitude stays where it's been and is currently at for most of my favourite books and games. That a live action adaptation would be great, but I'd rather they just didn't even try, than run the risk of tainting something I love. I can't handle another Eragon.

"dating_advice","t5_2s4kl","Okay, being a girl, I say you bring it up once things are going well, where you know her intention are and there is no awkwardness. 

I say let her know because first time can be awkward and well if you are dishonest, then the mood gets spoiled and you'll be more anxious and self conscious but if you let her know before things lead to that, there won't be no awkwardness and you can work together to make your first time a blast. Anotjer perk is, if she is truly onto you she won't mind this but if not, you lose her and save yourself from losing your virginity to someone who didn't value you.

This is my personal opinion, I like honesty and communication and if a guy open up about his sexual past or being a virgin, I really won't care as long as he is honest and let me know because I can work with him to find our likes and dislikes without any awkwardness and worrying about if I did something wrong, you know.",1688169707.0

"TalesFromYourServer","t5_2v480","I will tell you from my perspective. I have been a server. And I do not think I was a good server at all. 

As a single customer I don't want to hear about your life. I came into the restaurant to eat and have a desirable eating experience. I don't want you sitting down at my table and telling me about all the things going on in your life because honestly all I want to do is interact with my phone and eat preferably a nice dining experience. I'm not rude to you. I can tolerate it and expect it but I wonder sometimes why you can't understand I just want to come in there and eat I don't want to know about your life. One place I frequent it was very nice I loved it I went in there you know had my dining experience I was pleased I tipped well and then once they see you start coming in there then they want to start interacting in a way I would prefer they didn't. Now that's just me and I could be the aberrant person that doesn't fit into the square box cuz I'm a  round peg..
 And as long as the service is good I tip very well 30 to 50%
But honestly I really don't come in there on a regular basis to learn about you the same as many service probably don't care learn about me.

I have been going to a certain place once a week many times on end and the lady seeing that I tipped well she'd be like oh you're my favorite customer at the end of my service night. Okay I get that. And then one time she was going on and on sitting at my table yakking at me and I brought up my brother and I told her that I chased him down with a knife it was well deserved don't get me wrong and then she looked at me and said well maybe you're not my favorite customer after all.

Daizy is $99 on the Jelly Roll unit and RG is $150.... it's just weird since it's not the usual 3 or 4x from regular retail.  If that makes any sense.

"BreakUps","t5_2ra79","So, let's start at the beginning. I met this boy at summer camp when we were younger. I was never really friends with him nor did I like his friend group or him. (I didn't know it then but he and the girls in his friend group were pick me.) I had a crush on him when I first met him and my friends knew about it. Nothing ever really happened because it was morally a secret. Flash forward to recent times, I liked him in school again because his hair was different and he was less of a pick me. I would see him during my passing period and catch him looking at me all the time. My friend got the smart idea to text him and say, ""My friend likes you."" at the time I didn't care because I thought it would be okay, but... she then practically spills it to him on accident that I had a crush on him. At that time I wasn't really 'over' another guy that I had liked and I knew damn well he was going to play me. So, he acts on it and then asks me out, we start dating and doing the whole 'boyfriend-girlfriend' thing. At first, this relationship was so great and it was awesome. As the relationship went on he put less and less effort to the point where I was crying every single night and overthinking everything. I had confided in one of his best friends, who turns out hated him so much and thought that I was downgrading. Initially, his best friend talked to him for me and he changed and apologized. When he did apologize he didn't say what for and it was because of lack of effort and putting everything else before me. He was constanally rude to my friends. One day, I was super done with it because even after the talk with his friend, he still acted the same. he would like to read my messages and then not respond although when I would delete them then he would, he never had any interest in anything I did (sports, etc) or my interests. The next day he says that it would be better for me to have us break up and it was mostly a mutual agreement. I was never really over him though and it took such a long time. I spent weeks trying to get over him and when I finally did, Summer camp was starting up again. I found out we were counselors of the same group. He would constanally tell my friends and other people that I 'mentally abused him' and that I ended things harshly. I didn't, he initiated the breakup. I then realized that people started to lie to me and say they couldn't hang out but would hang out with him. I figured out he was saying this and then I corrected everything and got my friends back, but it took a while. In the end, I realized he mentally abused me and ruined my reputation. It's great. I'm still in the same group w him and all the kids ship us and it's awkward but I'm surviving. But, I always catch him looking at me whenever I talk to his friends who are my friends too, or whenever I say anything he stares. It's great but I guess it's fine.

From the time that Obama took office, Democrats have held a filibuster proof majority in the Senate for only 72 days total. Al Franken's victory was delayed due to several recounts. After Al Franken was seated, Arlen Specter switched parties from republican to democrat that democrats briefly had 60 votes (although Ted Kennedy was not a reliable vote due to his ill health). When he finally passed away, he was replaced and for a brief period of time, Democrats had enough votes to overcome a filibuster. That was until Byrd started falling into ill health and missing votes. Unlike Kennedy, though, he was replaced by a republican. Could the Democrats have nuked the filibuster? yes they could have, and in hindsight they should have. The problem is that they labored under the assumption that Republicans still dealt in good faith.",1688169709.0

1. Sticky Accelerator: Sometimes the accelerator refuse to comeback to the original resting position and sticks to the max. Very scary happened to me twice. I dont have car mats etc, so don’t think that’s the problem.

2. Gear slippages: This tata guys know this very well as it is very common. The gear software shifts it to neutral while climbing up and ones needs to apply brake and go to A— N— A till they get the drive mode back.

3. Horn doesn’t work. Due to the placement of the airbag the centre horn is very hard to press. The one on the sides of the steering wheel doesn’t work while turning.

4. The bonnet gap. The hood has a big gap as a part of the design. Due to this the engine compartment gets filled with dust and it is not possible to clean.

5. Rusting: Some screws were already rusting within a few months of purchase. Body has started to rust after 1.5 years.

6. Engine power. The engine is underpowered compared to the body weight and it is very difficult to overtake when there is need. 

7. Poor plastics: Bad quality plastics are used everywhere. They have become discoloured very quickly. 

8. Tata Services: Worst ever, takes a huge time, unable to fix anything properly. My car headlights are not aligned and one points to near and one far. They never could align it properly through the three services.

9. Big gaps on the door frames etc where the dust/rain accumulates. 

10. The list is endless. I always tell people: Tata nei mujhe punch maar diya.

Obanai was at full strength when landed 2 pointless hits on Muzan in the final fight  because once again he was useless in IC. He proceeds to get bodied and land strikes because Muzan decides to run away. He died from much less severe injuries than Giyu before DKT awakened which Tomioka was still standing for.

"30PlusSkinCare","t5_379gw","I grew up in a working class poor family. Mum did her best but there was no money in the family budget for teenage skin care products. I had oily skin with classic teenage acne at the time and sebaceous filaments on my nose. To make it worse, my Dad was a habitual pimple popper (having grown up with acne himself) and passed the habit on to me.

I got a part time job when I was 15, and spent my money on St Ives Apricot Scrub, TN Dickinson’s Witch Hazel Toner and Clean & Clear Oil Free Moisturiser. Oh, and Biore pore strips. I begged my Mum for Proactiv (the ads were constantly on TV in Australia in the early 2000’s), but I was always told it was too expensive. I would scrub my face raw, bathe it in the witch hazel toner and only felt good about my routine if my face was pink and stinging when I was done. I hardly ever used the moisturiser I bought, and dabbled in the Avon make up testers my Aunt gave us. No sunscreen of course - I wasn’t an outdoorsy type, which is probably what saved me in the long run.",1688169712.0

"playstation","t5_2qh6b","Played and finished all three, I would rank them with some reasoning behind it. 

1. Elden Ring, tho it’s not my favorite souls game the game for sure unlocks some game key memories, if it’s the scenery or a boss design… the game gets you if you are into fantasy heavy stuff. 
It offers the most amount of playtime and is fun to replay.

2. Ghost, this one is kinda hard, the setting is awesome and it looks great too. The gameplay feels smooth, if you are into samurai stuff you will love it. But overall it was just a decent experience… it feels like you played this formula a dozen times before. But it does it pretty well! 

3. Hogwarts, I was ready for a full on ride with this one and damn it was fun. But that feeling was overshadowed pretty quick for me sadly. The world didn’t feel alive if looked at more then once, the gameplay, while smooth, was very repetitive and to easy for my liking. Character progress felt like one big jump and loot doesn’t feel rewarding most of the time. A lot of potential but barley used half of it.

I had the worst anxiety attack of my life followed by multiple days of disassociating, self loathing, and lack of appetite. It was absolutely horrible but I’m lucky enough I have a support system of friends that were able to reassure and support me. It’s hard to imagine how I would’ve handled it without them.

"dysautonomia","t5_2scc7","Could be..  I most likely have parasympathetic excess..  in my teens, I used to have syncope and some sinus issues. Then when I was my most active and was having 6 eggs a day, I was at my healthiest without any issues. 

I only started smoking regularly in my mid 20s and at that point my only complaint was reflux esophagitis i.e. constant burping..  

I had stopped smoking once in 2010 for 3 months and had no symptoms, but I started having panic attacks when my circadian rhythms were affected by travel (multiple timezones).  That improved and was doing well. I then stopped smoking again in 2017, and was fine until an auricular acupuncture session flared me up. Soon after, I started a weird pattern of waking up at night at the same time due to the gut  and not being able to sleep..  it was probably the most dread I have experienced for 3 weeks .

I was then put on mirtazapine which gave me other issues, and I quit when it no longer worked for sleep in 2019. This is the point where my  dysautonomia blew up big time.  So there appears to be a complex interaction between histamine and  nicotine, which was made worse by the drug that triggered this 4 year long episode.  

I tried smoking in between just to see if it made me feel better, but it didnt make a difference.  So this year, I restarted smoking like a drug - 1-2 a day. Again, there were other interventions this year that probably have played a bigger role in my feeling better than nicotine, but at this point I am enjoying a relatively functional life. Another data point for me is that many fellow mirtazapine users on another forum are suffering similar issues, which makes me believe that once I heal from the drugs effects, I should be able to get off nicotine.",1688169714.0

"AskGayMen","t5_2wlnp","Just because the other person is gay, doesn’t mean you will be friends.
Give up the idea of trying to have sex with a straight man. Attempting to turn them gay will do no good. 

Learn about safe sex. This will help you in the long run. Sure, prep is good and all, but it only helps with HIV, but not STDs. Also, learn about HIV+, but undetectable. I used to say no to anyone who was hiv positive because I was uneducated. Now, I’m more educated and will actually take caution. 

Take caution with people. Anyone for that matter because some people are sneaky snakes. 

Learn queer history. Look up Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera. Look up gay and trans people who lived way, way before they did. 
Educate yourself about different gender identities. 

Learn to spot a red flag. Not only for romantic relationships, but platonic ones as well. 

Don’t do drugs and stay away from those who do. 

Lastly, surround yourself with good people who will lift you up and make you feel good about yourself as well as help you in life as much as they can. Also, learn how to be there for someone if and when they need you.",1688169715.0

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","#uh oh, reddit had a fucky-wucky because you are using it too much~

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

Byte code is usually machine independent code that an interpreter will execute on the fly. This is how Java works.

Assembly language is a human readable format that closely corresponds to the binary machine language of 1s and 0s that the Atmel CPU on the Arduino board can execute.

The build works like this… source code is compiled to object code, which is the binary microprocessor instructions (but just for your code) 

Next, this object code is then linked to the libraries (object code for all the Arduino functions and such) where all the addresses for the functions and variables is worked out. This is the final executable image that can be loaded into the microcontroller memory and executed.

This binary image is often reformatted into a hex file, which is a bit more compact than a flat binary file. I can’t remember offhand if Arduino does this or not.",1688169716.0

"love","t5_2qhnh","Well, do I have a story for YOU… This is a copy/paste of a post I made recently:

“I feel like the luckiest girl in the world...

We all grow up with all sorts of ideas and expectations surrounding love, but we never truly believe that fairy tales can exist. Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella...these are all just stories, right?

Wrong. And I'm here to share my tale...

Rewinding back to 2007, I make the most important decision of my entire life, though I never quite grasped the gravity of it until recent months. I made the difficult choice to leave a bad situation at home despite having no plans for what I could/would do.

My older boyfriend (B, moving forward) at the time brought me back to his place with his two roommates, who all generously agreed to let me bunk until I could get on my own two feet. Here I am, this vulnerable, scared 18 year old girl who has been so sheltered she has literally no clue what she is in for...

I meet his roommates, we'll call them J and A. J and I were instant friends, as if we'd known each other forever. We bonded over shared interests, humor, activities, you name it. I can still remember the road trip we took to  a theme park, then we both spontaneously decide to go visit a cave along the way. We always had so much fun together, never arguing, always cracking each other up...

Fast forward to 2010, I meet my current husband (H). H was always threatened by J, believing he had feelings for me. I denied it, assuming J would have said something had that been true. Deep down, though, I knew that wasn't true, and I also began to question my feelings for J. Life happens, H and I move 2 states away, get married and begin our lives, albeit unhappily, I now see...

So fast forward again to April 2023: I am diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes and also decide to lose a ton of weight to improve my health. By this time, I'd gone through several social media accounts and never really used them anyway, and especially didn't care to post about my personal life. For whatever reason, I decide now is the time to post.

I get a DM from J, whom I haven't SEEN in 12 years at this point, nor have I spoken to with any sort of consistency over the years. He offers words of support and we begin catching up on so many lost years of communication. One thing leads to another, and he ends up confessing his love for me. I instantly realize that I have always felt the same, I just wasn't seeing it for what it was. It's like we were both wandering, lost in miserable, unfulfilled lives with people we don't belong with (both married), and suddenly it's like we were able to find one another again and fill the void we previously could never fill. Everything felt right, all at once. We knew, this was it. We were always meant for one another...

The spiritual connection we have is unfathomable. We read each other's thoughts, reach to text or call the other at the exact same time, say the same thing at the same time, and weirdest of all? We can FEEL each other from 570+ miles away from one another. (Ex: we each will randomly get the feeling the other is upset/sad/mad/depressed/anxious/etc and when we ask the other about it, whatever we felt was wrong is EXACTLY correct)

We're both in the process of divorce and selling our homes, and I plan to move back 'home'.  I know it sounds crazy, I know it sounds too good to be true, I KNOW THIS...But, none of that matters for the simple fact that I also KNOW what we have is one of a kind.

He is my Soulmate, and I his. If we can beat the odds we have beat, then so can you. So to whoever needs to read this: DON'T give up! DON'T lose hope! Just when you think all is lost, you may only just be getting started...❤️”

The moral of this story: GO FOR IT!!!! You have literally NOTHING to worry about. She may be waiting for you to say something, or maybe not. But you will never know unless you say something.

Don’t be like myself and my guy…we lost 17 years together because we couldn’t speak our feelings, then I moved 600 miles away.",1688169716.0

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

 Please read all the rules before engaging in this sub. We're adults here, so communicate, please!

"Dreamtheater","t5_2r25x","I got some EarPeace Music concert plugs awhile back that I think I've only used once largely because I go to *just* few enough concerts to not have a routine established and I end up forgetting them.... but I recall them being decent, they come with three different filters for different noise reduction levels and I remember I wanted to change either up or down after that show but otherwise they worked well enough.

Not a very informed recommendation I know, but for a long-term reusable solution they were affordable and I got them after seeing a lot of other recommendations, so consider this me forwarding those. 

As for DreamSonic, I of course forgot them so I bought some of the cheap foam ones on the way to the venue and I ended up off and on having one out during AAL and Devin so I could actually hear music and tone instead of just a wall of muffled noise, and then just left them out entirely for the whole DT set. And I have to say, when I got out of the show and got in my car my ears were a lot less compressed and weird feeling than they have been for most concerts I've attended unprotected in the past. I don't think they're running this tour very loud at all. And I was literally in the front row near the end, face to face with speaker cabs. 

I wouldn't officially recommend not wearing protection, but I would say if you're gonna do it for a show, especially a DT show, this would be the one to do it.",1688169716.0

"RemoteJobs","t5_2vs4i","All of these things are normal for a job to ask for. \*\*\*The thing to consider is WHEN to give them these details\*\*\*

The appropriate time to share documents is after they have offered you a job IN WRITING and you have a start date. **In fact, you can offer to give these sensitive details (SSN and DL) on your first week, to be safe. That is the smartest way, and only HR should be asking.** 

 I work remotely, and have for years, and yes - this is what they need AFTER you have accepted an offer and have started work. Usually, HR will ask for this during your first week, although some ask before you do your due diligence and research the company - big time. Be smart, but maybe don't screw yourself out of a job. :)

Let's talk about your list:

**Full name:** needed, obviously. You have to pay taxes and receive a check and whatnot.

**Home address:** needed, again, for tax purposes, where to send your W-2 or tax forms - they also need to acquire workers comp in your state if you are in a different state- lots of reasons for your address.

**Picture of Social Security:** They ask for SSN to verify your identity and work authorization and perhaps to complete a background check; but a picture? That is only sometimes a requirement. 

**Drivers License: This is very commonly needed, especially if you will be driving for the company but even if you arent.** Still, ask the person who needs this stuff why they need pictures and not just the numbers, especially if they have never seen your face and cannot possibly be using it to check for a visual match of your person...Ask them and don't accept anything but a reasonable answer.

\*\*\*It is perfectly acceptable to send them the basic info (Name and address) only in the email, and leave out the SSN and DL, asking them exactly why they need copies and not just the numbers. Also, what exactly are they needed for? How will they be filed? Do they have a secure way for you to transmit these documents? 

I know it's tempting to just ""do what you have to do"" to get a remote job, but scammers are hoping for that. A legit employer will be glad you care about protecting your information because that shows you will be serious about protecting their important information, too. 

Good luck, you got this!!",1688169718.0

To check charging method, when plugged in, go under Settings -> Battery and Device Care -> Battery.  It should tell you if it's fast charging(15-18watt), super fast charging (45watt) or super fast charging 2.0 (45watt)

The S22 and S23 don't have a toggle to turn off Super Fast Charging.  Only toggles Fast Charging and Fast Wireless.  The Fast Charging toggle does toggle on/off Super fast as well.  

As far as chargers. If it supports USB-C PD 3.0 with PPS it could be flakey.   And you do need 5a cables to get 45 watt.   


I have a RavPower 90 watt USC-C PD3.0 w/PPS that will Super fast Charge (25watt) my S22ULTRA and S23Ultra but not SFC2.0(45watt).

More recently, now that I have insurance, I have followed up on what PP had told me and finally got treated for insane fibroids and got the hysterectomy that I wanted for yeeeears, through my PC.

If you want to express your strong disagreement with the API pricing change or with Reddit's response to the backlash, you may want to consider the following options:

3. Cancelling your subscription of Reddit Premium

6 MONTHS of NOTHING? What is your problem? Neither of you was interested in a date, or it would have happened. YOu did not show any interest, so he found someone else. What did you expect? - Both of you pining for years, without anything happening?

"Wavyhair","t5_33ywz","Wavy hair post

I have fine, high density, high porosity, wavy/curly hair (2C-3B). 

Some texture notes: I have a mixture of S-curls and thick ringlets underneath. My hair gets wet very easily and it dries very quickly. Until I realized it was Not Straight, I preferred conditioners with thick texture and felt like my hair was always dry. 

1. All washing is done upside down

2. clarifying shampoo: 1-2x/week (1x/month with Overtone The Fader) 
*right now I’m using the rest of my Prose subscription shampoo bottle, which I maintained for several months but didn’t love. I may try Lus brand next. *

3. Co-wash: Rinse, then Curlsmith co-wash, from root to tip, squishing. *I don’t love Curlsmith products. I spent the money on the sample sizes and I barely use them at all. The co-wash is nice, but I won’t rave about anything else.*

4. Moisturize/curl enhancer: Rinse again. Section hair approximately by feel and apply Shea Moisture High Porosity Smoothie sparingly (really, sparingly — like, a thin layer on my three middle fingers) on the sections, squishing again. 
5. Detangle: Using a flexible curly detangling brush and still upside down but moving my head in every direction, like flipping from side to side, I brush “hard” in every direction against the natural grain of the hair (overdirecting? Idk, not a hairdresser 😅). By “brush hard”, I mean I make sure to get the brush deep into the density of the hair and especially into the crown, so as to get that tension I need to encourage the curls. I wind up with my hair all slicked up along my skull and the lengths curling a little. I think I squish a little here too. 
6. Bowl Method: I fill a mixing bowl about half full of warm water and rinse my producty hands in it. Dunk tresses in the bowl, not all the way to my scalp, twisting my head this way and that.
7. I now have soggy, dripping “ropes” (I think this is what’s usually called clumps). 
8. **Important Tip that I figured out if you have trouble with stringy texture and hair not clumping:** try not to squish with claw hands, because that will separate those ropes/clumps into thinner sections.  Instead, I think of it as squishing with my “palms”. So instead of having my hand open and my fingers wide apart and scrunching, I keep my fingers together, let the rope coil into my palm as I move it up toward my scalp, and “fold” my hand in half to squelch the water out of the individual ropes without separating it into smaller strands. 
9. Repeat dunking and squelching 3-4x. 
10. Dunk one more time, and with ropes dripping, apply gel. 
11. Gel: I use Prose’s custom gel and I really like it. It has quinoa protein?? I love that it’s in a jar instead of in a squeezy tube. I dip my fingers in and get 1/4-1/2 tsp. Spread gel over hands and grab a little water from the dunking bowl to loosen it up. 
12. Use slow praying hands to smoosh gel all along a hand’s-length section of individual ropes, making sure to get a section that is all bangs. (*I think of this in terms of slowly smooshing gel along the length, sort of like lengthwise pulsing, rather than sliding my hands down*) 
13.  Then squish ropes upward to the scalp individually, again being careful to squish my bangs as individual ropes. At this point the ropes are pretty thick and squiggly, like beanie baby snakes 😂 
14. *NO PLOPPING OR EVEN MICROPLOPPING* I literally take an old T-shirt and just hold it along the tips of the ropes and lift toward my scalp to grab the last drops of water. Any more squeezing or water removal than this at this point and I lose the clumping I’ve worked so hard to enhance. 
15. If I’m washing in the evening, I pile it all on top of my head into a silky bonnet overnight. No pins or clips or scrunchies or anything. 
16. If I’m washing in the morning, it’s straight to diffusing! Hover diffuse with cool air upside down and moving my head around gently, until the cast forms, then pixie diffuse until about 50% dry. 
17. Mousse: I like Not Your Mother’s Curl Talk or Herbal Essences Curl Enhancing Mousse. I use a tennis-ball size of mousse, smoosh it in my hands, flip my head over, glaze it over everything, then apply what’s left to the roots. 
18. Then keep diffusing, piling the clumps into the diffuser “bowl” and trying not to separate them at the root. 
19. I stop at about 85%-90%. It feels crunchy af and weird as hell 😅
20. When it’s all the way dry, I scrunch out with scalp oil! I have a bottle of Prose scalp oil that I got in exchange for completing an R&D survey. I have no idea what it’s supposed to do, but it’s very soft and lightweight and I like what it does for my waves. I use the eye dropper to put drops all over my scalp (about a half eye dropper, so maybe 12 drops all together?) then I put 3-4 drops in my palms, warm them up, and focus on massaging my scalp with my fingertips before moving to tousling close to the roots and finally flipping my head over and scrunching the ends.",1688169721.0

You're missing the point. *Almost everyone* uses the default subs *in addition to the smaller subs*. 

If a million people read r/funny but they also each belong to a small sub of 1000 people, and those small subs become unsuable, they'll stop coming to the site. And those million r/funny subs go away at the same time. 

You cannot look at reddit just through the lens of its biggest subreddits. That's a fundamental truth about the site. Reddit's appeal is in its very deep, very specific content.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NAH because Raj is truly just freaking out in an attempt to protect his kid, but that doesn't mean that Raj is right. He isn't. *You* are right, OP: this is not sustainable, and it's likely to cause other significant problems that matter to you to protect Maya from, even while it is very slightly reducing the risk of choking.

Raj, I had a similar concept to deal with recently, but one which is a little more obvious to see, so let me tell you about it. My teenaged son is going to Europe this summer, on a group educational program. It's a ten hour flight from our home airport. 

Our family is intensely cautious, even now, about Covid. We are all multiply vaccinated, and so the odds of any of us dying from it are fairly low, but Long Covid is a monster that ruins lives. I can't even begin to think of my beautiful, bright son whose life is really just getting started, cut off from most of the things I know he wants most by a disability which resembles my own. 

I have severe fibromyalgia. I know how limited my own life has been because of my disease. I managed to make a life, of sorts, but it's very limited. If my son gets Long Covid, his life will resemble mine pretty closely. I don't want even to think about that, let alone to risk it. 

And so my son wears masks any time he's indoors with people who are not our immediate family. So do the rest of us in my household. He doesn't mind; he understands that there are still real risks despite the number of government agencies which have yielded to politics and declared the pandemic to be over. 

The problem is this upcoming flight. A ten hour flight plus airport time and transit to/from the airport at both ends is about 15 hours. And he *cannot* safely go for ten hours in a dry environment without eating or drinking due to the mask. This isn't guesswork -- we're Jewish, and so we fast fully (no food or water for up to 24 hours if your health can handle it) a few times every year. We know *exactly* how long he can fast before he begins to get dizzy and nauseous and risks passing out. Not as long as this. 

And so, despite my own -- truly rational! -- fears about his catching Covid and developing Long Covid from it, I daren't tell him to maintain strict mask discipline throughout the entire time on the plane. If I go too far to protect him from the problem that I am personally most afraid of, I won't go far *enough* to protect him from something else. 

You and your daughter are in the same position. If you do truly *everything* in your power to protect your daughter from choking, you're going to run much higher risks of other problems that are important to protect her from at all. The risk of falling severely behind in school because of how much time she's spending chewing her meals, both at lunch and at home, for instance. Or the risk of her suffering significant mental health troubles due to the obsessive pressure (and the likely social ostracism that follows).

So, like me, you need to find a compromise -- a way to protect your child *mostly*, keep them safe enough that you can't do better without messing up something else for them pretty badly in the process. It's hard! But we don't have a choice... parenting involves keeping track of so *many* factors that are necessary to keep your child safe and thriving. If you focus passionately on the specific one that frighten you, you won't be able to focus with equal care on the others. 

Raj, I went into this saying NAH, but that's only because I know you really don't mean to harm your child. You're only trying to keep her safe. But you're still in the wrong here, even if you're not an AH, and you still need to do it differently, or your daughter and your wife will suffer badly.",1688169725.0

It took me 2 years to heal my nostril, and the second year was incident-free; it was just THAT slow and stubborn. And it was my only healing piercing! 

Biggest thing you can do is avoid sleeping on them, gently clean them when they're crusty, and otherwise LITHA. Next best thing you can do is help your body out. Get enough sleep if you can. Drink lots of water. Take your vitamins. Cut down on alcohol, drugs, and sugar - all can lower your immune system and slow healing. Eat a clean and healthy diet. Saline is good to use for cleaning but it won't magically heal anything - it's just a gentle enough cleaner that it usually doesn't irritate unless you overuse it. 

Patience, patience, patience. I get the urge to ""do something"" about pissed off piercings but unless there's a clear issue (i.e. injury or wrong jewelry) just letting your body do its thing often works wonders.",1688169726.0

That’s 11 hours a day if done in 90 days from nothing. ~9 hours a day if already A2 — and that assumes there’s no diminishing returns. It’s not realistically possible.",1688169728.0

"flyfishing","t5_2qoeg","Lived here for almost 30 years, worked for Orvis  for 16, had a house on the Battenkill in West Arlington for 10 years. I’ve never caught a trout in the Battenkill and I have fly fished all over the river and the country. I think it’s more legendary than a great fishery. 

I don’t think anyone at Orvis is going to give up their good spots. 

That said I have recently fished the west branch of the Battenkill and have had fun catching small native Brook Trout and some small wild Browns. 

You could try pulling off on some of the spots along River Road in Arlington. I don’t think there is one place any better than others. There are fish all along and some really decent ones too. It’s just challenging. 

You could also try the NY Battenkill. I’ve heard people have better luck there.

During a period where all the factions of my world wared over a series of flying islands a group of bards invented a way of controlling people's minds via the use of songs and conversations that contained subliminal messages known as Mind Whispers. When these bards would perform for someone, they would implant an idea into a target's mind that would change the behavior of the target. Often the Bard's were hired by various nations to implant harmful ideas and behaviors into the minds of the enemy. Often these ideas made the bard's targets hostile to thier neighbors or extremely paranoid to a point where they didn't trust anyone they met. Some bards implanted ideas that made the victim believe that thier bodies had been overtaken by intense pain, leaving them completely incapacitated. Even worse, some bards found a way to change the target's actions so that they would unwittingly spread the bard's Mind Whisper to other people. The people who fell victim these bards were usually soldiers, but many nations were just as fine using these techniques on civilian targets. Luckly, these techniques were mostly lost in the fallout of the war and outlawed by the surviving nations.

I suppose I can use the very simple explanation that if you ingest a the thimerosal in a vaccine or pour it on your skin, then yes, bad things happen. But when it's part of a larger mixture and *injected* in smaller doses, it's not fatal. I mean, I already explained that latter part before, but you don't want to listen because I'm a mercury-brained idiot in your mind.

Do you need to have an in-depth explanation of the difference between the effects of ingestion and injection? And those of large and small amounts? I can do that for you, if you want.",1688169729.0

When my son was 2 weeks old I was sitting and nursing him and realized he never looked up at me, never made Eye contact, while we were nursing. I called my husband at work in tears because I was convinced my newborn was blind. 

My husband, the sweetest man ever, said ""there are all kinds of amazing, accomplished people in the world who are blind. Just look at Ray Charles!  Maybe our son will grow up to be a wonderful musician like Ray Charles.""

 I wailed and said, ""I don't care if he becomes Ray Charles. I want my son to see his mother's face!""

 I called our pediatrician and the reception is said to come in at 9 AM the next day and she would make sure we were the first people seen for the day. And we were.

The doctor put my son on the exam table, picked up a zebra toy, held it in front of him, and moved it. His eyes tracked at the entire time. Soooooo, not blind.

This is so bizarre that I’m struggling to believe this post is even real.  This type of testing is expensive when done by a psychologist.  Like, thousands of dollars in Canada for ONE person.  You don’t get it done for fun, or for family therapy.  You get it done because you are struggling with learning, behaviour, daily life functioning, etc.  At the very least the two kids are by all accounts doing well at school.  So why on earth did they need IQ tests?  Why did the whole family!?  

And in theory, a “trained therapist” would have explained that a full scale IQ actually involves multiple domains and there is nuance in reporting an overall IQ much of the time.  It’s not like they just give you a number and go “you’re smarter”.  If your daughter was higher in overall IQ but your son had a processing speed at the 99% percentile, how do you decide who is “smarter”?",1688169731.0

Tiafoe I could see getting to quarters vs Alcaraz.  Meddy if he makes it to quarters is more likely to be against Norrie (as much as I hope he gets destroyed R1 lol) or another darkhorse in that quarter.

Sinner might be able to pull through, But I can absolutely see Fritz taking him down.

"MedicalCannabisNZ","t5_3hm4kz","Well in terms of effects it’s the perfect all rounder for my needs and conditions.

It has significantly helped with my fibromyalgia nerve pain severity, in terms of my PTSD, while I’m mentally not in a good place at the moment due to *gestures at the world*, it tames those symptoms to a much more manageable level, intrusive suicidal thoughts or visual intrusions, like for instance sometimes I can look at a pair of scissors and my brain will give me a visual of any possible “BAD” pathway that item could do in terms of hurting me, this strain has slowed down those triggers so I can try catch them/acknowledge them before my fight/flight goes off. And for my Ankylosing Spondylitis, arthritic damage and fusion throughout my lower back and wide spread inflammation throughout the whole body, this strain puts a weighted blanket on those radiating areas.

Don’t get me wrong, still in pain and have to medicate throughout the day but it’s the only strain to tick all of my conditions in one? And it’s given a really nice equilibrium sort of vibe between mental, emotional and physical health.

"HuntingtonWV","t5_2wu1p","Imma speak more of my experiences views on the area and less so on prices.

Personally, I fall in the category of being cynical regarding Huntington and Wv in general. But I live in the Guyandotte area and I just dislike seeing so much unused land or buildings.
 

Despite this, I do vouch that Ritter is a lovely area, nice and shady. It’s charming.

East and West Pea ridges are nice.

Nobody has mentioned this smaller community but near Barboursville on some more back roads there is a place called Williamsburg colony where I grew up. Really nice. Very nice actually.

I think it looks nicer than it did when I lived there at some parts. Lovely neighborhood.

This neighborhood is not far from Bville and is near Bvill park too. 

Bville is known for some events and having grown up there it’s a nice town. 

Huntington is close by. Huntington is a Uni town that works in tandem with Cabell huntington hospital.

I don’t think others have mentioned but, Bville is near the Huntington mall more so than Huntington itself ironically. 

So basically, Ritter area is more suburban than anything. But I feel living in Bville, since it’s close to huntington anyways, has more to offer close to you. In regards to shopping, Bville park, events, depending on where you go can be quiet. Where as huntington you’d be closer to Pullman, the big sandy arena. The River, despite being dirty can be always nice to drive by.",1688169732.0

You could also try to remove them from the HOA. Start going to meetings and let the neighborhood know. Supply all the evidence you have. If they are doing this to you they are probably doing it to others. Most members of an HOA don't show up to meetings so it leaves a few people running the whole HOA.

"startrek","t5_2qixm","It was a theory since the Voyager crew landed in the 1990s Los Angeles. It basically says ""Due to Timetravel, the Timeline has been changed in the series subtly each time."" The evidence and reasoning is the canon inconsistencies tend to happen after a Time Travel episode. 

TOS & The Cage: Technology, and Timeline changed, from The Cage until ""The City on the Edge of Forever"" Star Trek had a different look, and even different characters, the change was subtle, and it's a blink and you'll miss it. But since City on the edge of forever was the second to last episode of the first season, and the second season had Chekov as a main cast member without fan fair, or acknowledgement of him being new, and with Star Trek Wrath of Khan having him remember Khan who was 1st in ""Space Seed"" season one. A slight retcon happened at this point. 

These kinds of things kept happening in Star Trek, and with all the time travel episodes, and movies, Voyager was the last straw. Canon said Eugenics War happened in the 90s, Khan escaped Earth in 1999. So you can see, the problem here with mid 90s Voyager crew in LA. No mention of the Eugenics War. So people created the theory to explain why the eugenics war had not yet happened. 

&#x200B;

The line about Khan being 30 years late was soft confirmation of the fan theory. Meaning that yes the ""prime timeline"" is subject to change due to Time travel.",1688169734.0

"recruitinghell","t5_3bwcw","Assuming you are actually getting contacted by Internal Recruiters and not Agency Recruiters, as that is going to change how your day goes.

Internal: 

* It is a game of triage. We typically have between 25-70 jobs open at a time (and more on the 40+ jobs open) for various sections of the company. I have on average between 40-70 jobs across an entire coast of the United States. 
* All of those requisitions are at various stages of being filled. Some need to be posted, others candidates moved through to interviews, negotiations on some, offers, and helping candidates go through the entire onboarding process. Each I get about 50-100 new candidates every day across all my positions that I have to move through (interview scheduling, answering questions, declining people so they get notified and are not ghosted, calling to see if an offer works, etc). 
* In addition to that I need to meet with the managers as most of my day is spent talking with the actual hiring managers so that I can nail down why this position is open for so long and fill it (by changing the pay, the skills, faster interviews from them, or clarification on business needs). 
* Then I also need to be in about 3-5 hours of meetings a week (team meetings, 1 on 1s with my manager and their manager, training other recruiters or getting trained myself, company wide meetings and updates with the hiring managers on their reqs for leadership). 
* I also have to make sure all the data from the above is tracked or else a req goes unfilled or a candidate doesn't get an offer or they get stuck in interview pending with no feedback for weeks, and to do that I have to update in triplicate of about 2-4 systems each depending on the task. 
* Truth be told, updating the trackers and moving people through the system along with getting hiring mangers to respond is the bulk of my day. 
* I do not actively source for candidates in that time as it takes on average (although probably less in this market) 2 and half hours of just sourcing to get one candidate for an interview. Not a hire just an interview. Typically I have another department that is overworked and understaffed who just does sourcing (I had to train the last one at my previous company).

Agency Recruiter: 

* Meetings with your boss and other team members
* Posting requisitions and getting hiring managers to actually call you back (as you do not work for their company directly) and are usually given poor information on what to do your Boolean searches with (that is how they find you to send you that generic message).
* Then it is sourcing through multiple job boards and cold emailing (is that a word?) candidates as again the average time it takes to get a candidate an interview is 2 and half hours of work for one interview and as an Agency recruiter you don't get access to the hiring managers as much so you probably have to increase that time although again in this market it is easier to get a response rate.
* Than you need to negotiate the salary for them, call them, get ghosted half your day, do phone screens for the rest of it which takes up a TON of time.
* You also have about 5-10 requisitions so multiply all of the above by that number.

Being a bad recruiter is very easy, but bad recruiters typically don't last long as they don't get commission or are overwhelmed and let go within a year or two. Being a good recruiter is very difficult. In this market it favors companies so the bad recruiters are going to be worse at their job while also making more placements (because people need to eat). In addition most companies are laying off half of their recruiters and giving almost the same workload to the ones that remain.

I know that doesn't make what happened to you right. It isn't but  the above can give you some clarity of their day and I hope that helps at least.

Sorry, he’s being a POS.

Your abdomen is being cut open and a 10+ lb mass (baby and placenta) are being removed.

Ask if the next time he has major surgery and is bleeding from his bottom and stomach, if you can invite the entire family to see him hours after he wakes up and is in recovery?

Also… if both sets of grandparents, siblings, and his siblings (with spouses?) are coming, are you supposed to fight 8-14 people to hold your baby??? And if you’re planning on breastfeeding how are you going to latch with that many people there?

And why, on the day after your major surgery when you should be resting and recovering, are you offering for that many people coming to see you as a compromise? That’s not good for you or baby.

You need to stop referring to this as a birth. Moving forward, you should need to refer to it as *your major surgery*. Your husband needs some reconditioning.

 - “Yes, my major surgery is scheduled on X date.”
 - “What? You want to visit me the hour after my major surgery? *surprised face* No, I’ll be recovering.”

Admirals can't go chase Pirates and end up destroying cities and killing tons of civilians, whose job is protecting in the first place. Again Kizaru's feelings is irrelevant.

I 100% agree that completely dismissing some of their experiences only serves to further alienate... These men have experienced real rejection, disgust, anger, disrespect, etc, and however much they might deserve it it does not make those experiences less real.

They lack the tools to understand why women are treating them poorly and what they can do to improve relationships in their lives, and when all they hear is hate and people dismissing their feelings they will dig a deeper hole into their bubbles and forums and echo chambers.

Anyway, I'm so sorry about all the shit you've had to endure because humans can be shitty and cruel. But I'm sure that you are on the right path to healing and I hope that things get better and that your experiences and those of people in similar situations can serve as inspiration for people who otherwise might have chosen hate instead of love.",1688169736.0

I don't really see why you ought to be rude over my ignorance instead of informing me. I'm well aware there are products made for literally any company to slap their label on. However those companies need to meet a standard for their product. Amazon has no obligation to do so, they'll sell whatever any AliExpress vendor will throw at them, even if it literally emits harmful radiation which has been the case in the past.

For an item to be food grade from the looks of it, based on what the regulating bodies require, it needs to be cured properly and not have harmful elements in it like formaldehyde.

I already addressed your ""multiple instances showing otherwise"".  10s of millions of people are not there showing off their kinks.  You are being deliberately misled by people circulating these handful of images.

And you are blowing those ""questionable"" situations way out of proportion using *deliberately misleading descriptions*, as I already explained, because all of the questionable situations I have seen aren't even rated R.  They are being shared on reddit without a NSFW label, that should tell you something right there.

If you think society is too lax in general about lascivious dancing and scanty apparel then go out and crusade against it by all means.

What I see on this sub however is one attack after another against gay people, using every vector of attack possible.  This isn't the latest is a string of attacks on racy public behavior, it's the latest in a strain of attacks on gay people.  The repeated theme here is ""gay bad"" not ""sexy behavior bad""

I went to the dealer with excellent credit, stated my intentions to get it below MSRP and that I’ll go to multiple dealerships until I got what I wanted.  After a few days, lots of dealer visits and emails, and a 5 hour “I won’t budge” attitude, I got my 22 Blue DCT for $34 flat.  Just stay patient and you’ll get the price you want.

So I (16f) don't want to give my room to my aunt when she comes to visit. Some context my aunt is coming to visit us for 10 days and my mom is planning on giving my room to her and she is just expecting me to go along with it. 

This is where I might think im the asshole. I said that I didn't want to give my room to my aunt because its my room and not hers she said that it would be rude to make her sleep somewhere else and that she's my aunt and that i should just give it to her. Am I being the asshole for not wanting to give my room to her I don't really think that it's very rude not to?

It's not like my aunt doesn't have any other options on where to sleep when she comes to visit, we have a spare bed in the basement that she can use which really isn't bad because it's cooler down there and it's gonna be pretty hot when she comes like 25 - 30°C. And if she doesn't want to sleep down there which I understand because it is unfinished we can move ot upstairs into an office space we have that has plenty of space for the bed and her belongings. I just don't want to give my room to someone I don't even know I like only met her like once when I was 5 and I don't  even remeber that. I'll be honest I've been going though a rough patch lately realizing stuff about myself and I just feel like I would have no privacy by giving my room to her. It just feels so uncomfortable to imagine someone else using my room.

They note that he liked her in college, but the feeling wasn't mutual, or at least she didn't take initiative herself, given that Barry never would've being nervous, awkward whatever. Then they meet years later but it's at a point where being near him is great for her career because his Dad's case is the big story in town right now. So all of a sudden after years she's into him at the exact time his Dad's story is the hottest thing to be writing about.

"Equestrian","t5_2r4or","As others have already said, it really does matter what level of fitness you’re working with. The individual horse’s disposition also factors in. I think the majority of horses could truly care less about whether they get worked or not, but there are those who need it or they’ll go full ham. 

I own a mare like that. If she were a person, she’d be a crazy-eyed workaholic who suffers from rage issues and functional alcoholism. Leave her for more than 2 days and she’s a goblin. To be fair, she is a very fit, upper-level event horse, but obviously we limit the jumping regardless of what we work on in a given session. 

When it comes to more vigorous things like that, well, we all know the old adage that every horse only has so many lifetime jumps in them. Other than that, you could breeze that ding-dong for an hour most days and she’d still be a pain in the ass.

I have a gelding, on the other hand, who was retired from the track after 8 starts because…wait for it…he LEFT THE START GATE AT A TROT AND THEN WALKED OVER TO EAT GRASS. I have the video footage of this tucked away somewhere that his old trainer sent me. She was absolutely disgusted 😂 but ethical and pulled him that night to find a second “career” (snort, giggle, snort) for him, after which he eventually found his way to me. This beast has never in his life felt compelled to so much as trot if he’s not feeling it, and he could care less what other horses are doing. I’ve never seen anything like it in my life. I still make him put some time in multiple days each week, but he’s equally content to just sit and tell everyone to piss right off.",1688169737.0

"datingadviceformen","t5_2vu13","Bruh chill. Nothing abnormal here in this text communication.

You're not going to make someone more attracted to you over a text conversation. Keep it light and use it for logistics. 

If you have plans for Tuesday then just confirm or shore up the plan at some point this weekend.

Also, she may ghost you. She may cancel. It may not work out. That happens. It's out of your direct control. There's no magic words you could have said or way you could have gone about it differently to affect that outcome. It's not about you. That's just one person with a whole life you have little to no influence over, let alone know barely anything about yet.

So don't take it personal, because it's not. Just keep meeting more people, exposing yourself to new opportunities, working on yourself, and some good relationships will develop so long as you aren't doing anything alienating or toxic.

The surfer doesn't make the wave, but he doesn't have to get on his board and paddle out and be ready to catch it.

I'll admit, I'm like you, and very skittish about snapping due to what feel like statistically unlikely streaks of bad beats.  But playing a lot of Conquest, where there aren't really any stakes, has helped me get more comfortable about snapping.

Funny story: three times in the last week, I accidentally started a ladder match, not realizing I wasn't in Conquest.  Because I thought I was in proving grounds, I very casually snapped, then realized it wasn't Conquest, then actually won!  Three times!

Joking aside, I've generally found it super interesting how many trilogies end up like that.

"GachaClub","t5_2bhjdp","Names: Nono (left) and Nini (right)

Alias: The Creepy Twins

Ages: 9 (Nono's the older twin by 15 seconds)

Nicknames: Big Sister (Nono, often used by Nini) Little Sister (Nini, often used by Nono)

Birthday: June 2nd

Pronouns: She/Her (for both twins)

Personalities: Outgoing, energetic, sneaky, observant, protective (of each other)

Likes: Each other, cold weather, drawing, playing games, killing bad people

Dislikes: Rude/entitled people, crowded places, hot weather, losing when it comes to games

Species: Demon

Background: While these two grew up, they experienced death all around them, they were neglected and blamed for all of the family's problems. They eventually killed their parents and discovered a farm in the middle of nowhere, where they now live. Due to experiencing consistent death, they started to kill people who just so happened to get too close to their farm. They have no conscious, thus having no concept of good and evil. Despite this, they only kill bad people. Nono mainly goes after corrupt politicians and rapists, while Nini mainly goes after bullies and entitled people.

Alignment: Chaotic Neutral

Weapon of Choice: Hatchet (Nono) Kitchen Knife (Nini)

Aesthetic/Fashion: Lolita (Nono) Dark Academia (Nini)

Method of Killing: Nini will sneak up from behind the victim and hit them as hard as possible with a baseball bat, knocking them out cold. Nono will come out from the shadows and both twins will drag them to their house and to their basement and tie the victim up. When the victim wakes up, the torture will begin until the victims die. From there, the twins will dispose of their victim through burning the corpse, a body bag, etc.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List of Detailed Abilities

Repeated Strike: When the opponent makes eye contact with either Nono or Nini, the other twin will speed towards the target, intending to attack. If the opponent switches to the incoming twin, they will immediately halt, and the other will continue the assault. Rinse and repeat. The opponent may only make eye contact with one twin at a time, and the other will use the distraction for a devastating strike.

Delay: Nono and Nini create an after-image for close range. It can dodge melee attacks by confusing the enemy into attacking somewhere else.

Distortion: This ability allows Nono and Nini to deflect bullets and other projectiles away using an invisible shield in front of them. This skill also deflects physical attacks.

Elemental Barrier: Nono and Nini summon a barrier in the shape of a sphere around them, this sphere/barrier can take on any element, which has ranging effects.

Fire Manipulation: Nono and Nini possess excellent skill at manipulating fire, which allows them to enhance their weapons with this ability. They're capable of forming fireballs that can burn entire cities within seconds.

Curse Magic: Nono and Nini can use this ability to afflict powerful curses onto their opponents. They can use malevolent curses to harm opponent and weaken their power along with it, as well as afflict beneficial curses for healing and for other forms of combat support.

Monster Summoning: This ability allows Nono and Nini to summon various monsters to aid them in combat, these range from demons to eldritch horrors.

2.东北的人口流出情况其实和关内一众劳务输出大省比少很多，整个东北加起来一亿人实际上净流出只有不到六百万，甚至辽宁还是净流入省（大部分移民都是河北河南人），而关内人口和辽宁差不多的江西就净流出有六百多万。
3.东北目前的老龄化比例看似还挺乐观，“只有”30%出头，但是考虑到上世纪62-75年这一波婴儿潮的人开始步入老年，对应的到2035年，东北老龄化比例很大概率达到50%，到2050年，大概率超过60%。
4.东北目前只有三个城市能勉强跟上关内同级别城市（实际上曾经稳稳的全国前十大连相比之下已经衰落太多），但是即使是这三个城市也很不乐观，只能靠虹吸周边城市的人口来维持，尤其是辽宁有沈阳大连两大城市要供养，辽宁的鞍山朝阳抚顺锦州曾经也是二线城市目前早就全都人口负增长甚至gdp也负增长。而吉林的长春也不太乐观，曾经长春人口和gdp都只占据吉林省的不到四分之一，而如今人口占比达到了全省的一半，gdp更占据了三分之二，长春也荣获全国首位度第一的省会。曾经gdp是长春六分之五的吉林市（吉林省下的同名地级市），现在只有长春的六分之一。这也意味着吉林省基本被长春虹吸干净了，目前黑龙江也有这种趋势。
5.三省中财政最健康的是辽宁，前几年还是财政盈余省，但吉林和黑龙江财政状况非常不乐观，去年财政自给率只有20%出头，全国除了新疆最低，而吉林一个省财政收入加起来甚至比不过苏州的一个县级市昆山。东北的衰落是全方位的。",1688169738.0

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","#uh oh, reddit had a fucky-wucky because you are using it too much~

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

I think Rasmussen, Kostin, Kasper, & Edvinsson(after a potential slower start), will have big years for us, and the aforementioned direction we are heading in! 

The KHL team just said they are no longer trying to compete for Kostin, now that the Wings have him. Danielson is a character, leadership type guy. Becoming the Captain of the Wheat Kings at only 17. I think Yzerman see's himself, when he drafted him. I think Danielson and Kasper will elevate their offensive game big time/be steals of their draft years, like Mo was! And will be our 1C & 2C one day! I think ASP has potential to be like a Karlsson/Makar mashup type player, but only time will tell.

I am a lifelong Red Wings fan from B.C. Canada, where Yzerman is from. I became a Wings fan watching the 97, & 98 cups as a 7 yr old girl with my family. I have been a fan since then. I am distant relative of a former HOF captain, so hockey has always been an interest/the only sport I watch. I am super excited seeing what Stevie is building, more reminiscent of the team I watched him captain back then! After so many years of a bad, soft team.. And yelling at Blashill on my t.v. screen, for putting Sheehan on the pp after an 81 game goal drought in a single season, ect..

I am beyond excited to have Yzerman at the helm, building a multiple cup winning team like he did in Tampa! It just takes time with what he was given, and bad lottery luck, ect. I trust the Yzerplan 100%!",1688169738.0

"survivinginfidelity","t5_2x8ez","**found husband being sexual with others online and not sure what to do**

To be blunt, if you're comfortable being cheated on, disrespected, treated like a 2nd class citizen, and are ok with him contacting various women through porn sites, and possibly making plans to meet them for sex, then do nothing and let him keep doing what he is doing. You come across as somewhat dependent on your WH (wayward husband) and afraid to confront him. I can tell you exactly what he is going to say when confronted: 1) You are paranoid 2) You're seeing things that aren't there 3) You're delusional 4) You aren't meeting your wifey duties 5) If you really loved him you would know that he would never do anything to hurt you 6) You never pay me enough attention--blah, blah, blah. Those all come straight out of the ""Cheater's Handbook"" on how to handle a BW (betrayed wife) when she confronts you. I've seen it thousands of times--same song and dance.

If it were me, and, really, to get his undivided attention, I would sit him down and tell him something to the effect of, ""<husband's name>, don't interrupt me until I finish as I have something important to tell you. I have loved you for the past 16 years and have tried to be a good wife to you. However, you are now showing all the classic signs of an unfaithful spouse, hiding your phone when I'm in the room,  being distant and moody, so I can only assume you are cheating on me. So hand me your phone and unlock it and if you refuse or if I find you are cheating, I am going to make an appointment to consult with an attorney asap, as I absolutely will not share you with any of your love interests. So, what's it going to be?""

Do not give him a chance to delete his messages/texts. His refusal to hand over his phone would be a deal breaker for me. Don't let him know you have read his texts. Ask him questions that you know the answer to and see if he lies to you. It's possible to shock him back into reality and get him to seek help with an IC trained in infidelity.

"Catholicism","t5_2qi4f","I have the privelage of leading RCIA formation, but as a creedal Catholic I can - in many ways - relate more to you journey than the Protestant path. As such, there are many things I could say but I will summarize shortly with three questions:
1) The question of God is a yes or no question. 
2) The question of Jesus (as divine) is a yes or no question.
3) The question if the Catholic Church is a yes or no question.

If I understand, you have affirmed the first, but are agnostic to the second and third. Therefore I will recommend three resources:
1) Addressing the second question specially, Brant Pitre's ""The Case for Christ"" - phenomenal graduate level book accessible to non-graduate readers on how can we trust the Bible? 
2) Adressing all of them, Thomas Aquinas. You appear very philosophically minded and I know of two agnostic philosophers (Alasdair MacIntyre and Edith Stein aka Saint Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) who became Catholic upon studying his writings.
3) Prayer: ""one moment of prayer, of weak worship, confused contrition, tepid thanksgiving, or pitiful petition will bring us closer to God than all the books of theology in thr world"" (Peter Kreeft, Prayer for Beginners).

"polyamory","t5_2qu5n","It is fair to ask if this scenario really is fulfilling for you.  Polyamory does not mean lower standards.  Be sure you are your primary partner.

There are three areas people engaging in non monogamy really need to strengthen which aren't immediately obvious:

Social support network. You are engaging in an alternative relationship style perhaps for the first time in your life. You likely haven't worked through coming out to friends and family yet and you are lucky to have one close person other than your partners to discuss issues with and get support from. Monogamy can heavily value a partner as a best friend and the nuclear family structure heavily isolates us from engaging supportive communities. In order to thrive in polyamory you and your partners must have unique social circles and put time and energy into them. They must be genuine in supporting your own values and the new vision of who you want to be. Partners are not enough in themselves.

Self soothing. There will be many times a partner is not available to you or your are not the immediate priority. In addition to social supports, you must rely on yourself to keep perspective, refocus on your vision of what you want to create, and ensure self care is an ongoing priority. The best way to care for others and have thriving connections is to put yourself first. This way your partners will know you are not compromising or emptying yourself, confident you will assess and assets your own needs, AND know you will reasonably care for yourself in alignment with your values.

Compartmentalizing. Mostly just learning that polyamory is not a group hobby. One relationship really has no direct or automatic impact on another. Your feelings will differ, sometimes dramatically. Compartmentalizing is a way to acknowledge and make space for each relationship in its current state while not ""dragging the shit home."" This is again why social support networks are so vital- you can have safe processing spaces without poisoning partners long term view on eachother, as inadvertently as it may be.",1688169740.0

Si referitor la faptul ca nu urca curierul sus.. Ce sa mai zic. Te gândești ca poate vine cu o duba pe care nu o parchezi asa ușor fără sa nu blochezi pe alții.

"baccarat","t5_2z9lt","I used a flat bet and 1 step marty also positive 1 step progression. It works fine for me. 

Here it is: 

Bet 1 unit, if win  press to 2 units. if Win again you are +3 units.(W+2W=+3 )Reset to base bets.

Bet 1 unit, if lost, next hand bet 2 units, if you win you are +1 unit. (L+2W=+1) reset to base bet. 

Bet 1 unit, If Win, press to 2 units next bet, if loss you are -1, bet again 2 units, if you win, you are +1, reset. If lost, you are  -3 units, reset to base. 

Bet 1 unit, if lost you are -1, next hand bet 2 units, lost again, you are -3. Max lost total per micro game is minus 3. Reset to base.

Minus. 3 units or more is not so hard to recover just a little grinding and target profit of +5 units per session. Session Stop loss at -15  units or 5 micro game loss of -3. Get up and live to fight another day.

If you have a good solid strategy coupled with this money bet selection, and strong discipline  , you can win most of the time  and hardly wipe out your bankroll. I recommend the total size of your bankroll at least, 5 times or more of your stoploss units. 
I play onlylive casino online  never been in brick and mortar. So far, my ""business"" is doing good. Take my 5-6 units per session and Im out! Of course, there are lossing days but I grind it out. Approach this game in mind as a business investment, and not as a  degenerate gambler.

Also if your options are limited you may have to bite the bullet to receive the care that you need. 

It can be very nerve racking when your confidence in your doctors’ competency comes into question.

For everyone pounding that drum of HOW DARE SHE NOT BE PROFESSIONAL!!! What do you expect from the Bible Belt? OP has been ok up until the last year.

"dndnext","t5_2vbgl","No op but I'd like to try, it will be kinda hard for me to describe as I don't have much experience with pf2 (although I can confirm it FEELS great). But I am gonna try.

So, first thing is they're free. You can do them every single turn if you so wish which is fantastic compared to manoeuvres. Another thing is they're genuinely equally good, at least depending on build, wheras there are some Manouevres (trip attack) that are almost always the best pick, so they actually feel like proper choices. As a fighter with Sudden Charge i can lock eyes with an enemy 75ft away and know I can fuck them up while perhaps someone who took Power Attack instead would want to wait till they have 3 actions available to cut that guy in two, basically the various choices feel very impactful turn by turn as they can drastically affect how you play. 

Also I feel that comparing them to Fighting Styles isn't the best, they're mostly just choosing a weapon group and occasionally an actual change in your method of fighting that will be worse than just going with the weapon styles. 

Higher level ones are also more impressive, a unique interaction I love is that Sudden Leap and Felling Strike can combine for a 3 action activity to Jump a massive distance and slam something out of the sky which is just the coolest shit. Both of these feats are level 8 but at level 9 fighters get an extra feat, so it's not too high of a level requirement (by pf2 standards, from what I can tell campaigns often go to higher levels than in 5e).

Anyways this is a not great explanation as to why I think PF2 Fighter feats are a lot more interesting and fun than 5e fighter stuff, I'll also mention that pf2 combat is just inherently a lot more tactical than 5e due to having more viable options to work with and a more complex action system but again not really enough experience to go too in depth about it.",1688169742.0

* It is about 90% finished

* Cavs plays a 1980s Simmons electronic drum kit on it

* An NPR article described it as the second part of ""a two-parter about climate anxiety""

* It was written in the same way as Ice Death and Petro with the band doing super long jams and each song being created by stitching together the best parts of a jam

* Regarding its relationship with Petro, Stu said ""Some people will listen to them and be like, ‘These two records are nothing alike’ and some people will listen to them and be like, ‘These are a mirror image of each other.’ I’m curious to see how that plays out because everybody listens to music in a different way and intellectualizes what they listen to differently.

Questions about [SEASONS](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/14fzvlj/psa_faq_seasons_seasonal_and_nonseasonal/), Crossplay between PC and Console, the Battle Pass or Monetization, are preferably also posted there, as the FAQ might already have an answer to your question.  

This helps to keep the subreddit and people's reddit feeds more readable and overseeable. It also makes it easier for the community to respond to such questions, which increases the chances that you get a fitting response to your specific issue.  

Questions / Requests for Help about Issues with Hardware, System Requirements, Controllers / Keyboard / Input, Monitor / Screen / Widescreen, Visuals, Lag, Connection, Login, Errors, etc, can also fit in the most recent [Weekly Technical Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Technical%20Help%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).

My wife was unfaithful and it was heart wrenching. What I would recommend is, when you're calm enough to talk, try letting your kids know that you're just not ready to talk right now. If you don't hate them, say that. If you're just in pain but you still love them and are just confused right now, say that. Their whole world just got turned upside down too, I'd imagine this is a strange and scary time for them too. As someone who is a step dad to some great kids, I just want to point out as a few others have that the title of ""Dad"" isn't necessarily given, it's earned. And it sounds like, if your kids are reaching out to you during this terrible and scary time, that you've earned that title regardless of what a piece of paper or some genetics say. I'm not going to pretend it's easy. I hope you get the help you need and find a way to pull through this. Good luck to you OP",1688169743.0

What I do get annoyed with is her claiming god does everything for a reason yet lobbying against LGBTQ+ folk and their treatment despite the fact that supposedly god made them in his image, and also supposedly god made her infertile yet she’s going out of her way to treat it.

Alright if you're bunkering down you need the basics. 

Canned food. Dry goods. Bottled water. Gallons and galleons of water. If you have access to a water source get a lifestraw or some kind of survival tool to filter the water if it's contaminated.

If you don't already have one get a bike. If you have to get somewhere and public transport isn't an option it's faster than on foot and you can carry more supplies easily. 

Get a solid backpack. If you have one make sure it has your tools, snacks, drinks and electrolyte solutions (think Gatorade). 

Get a first aid kit. Not just bandages you need gauze, medical tape, self adhesive glue, stock up on whatever pain killers and anti-biotics you have access to. I know when I went to Italy it was easy to buy over the counter pain killers. Get whatever you can afford. 

Save up some currency. Get small bills at first. Get a few hundred euros worth. You might not he able to Pay for what you need if the grid goes down because the power is disrupted. 

If you have weapons make sure they are cleaned and prepared. Lubricate and sharpen your blades/metal surfaces. I know you have a a gun but font plan to use it. Make sure it's impossible to easily obtain. Only have one key to your safe and make sure you don't get it taken from you. You might not wanna use your gun. That doesn't mean other people will feel the same way. 

Talk to your neighbors. Don't tell them everything that you're doing until you know you can trust them. Even still don't volunteer information unless asked. 

Get an emergency radio. Some walkie talkies. Head lamps and flashlights. If you can find them get physical maps of your area. Learn the streets by name. Make sure you don't get lost and if you encounter rioters you need to know how to avoid them. 

Good luck from a Yank across the pond. 💙",1688169745.0

I think it’s always good practice to keep them in their own cricket enclosure, because I never feed off the crickets the day I buy them. Since I breed my other feeders, I know they’re safe and healthy, but it’s always chancy for me bringing in feeders from an outside source—I’m a worrier. I like to keep the crickets a few days before feeding, so I can make sure they’re all healthy and gut-loaded. I keep the crickets in a large critter keeper with substrate and springtails, give them fresh veggies & protein daily, and haven’t had to deal with any smell. Deaths are rare, too, but I make sure to remove those as soon as I see them. I buy crickets maybe once a month, and they last the entire time, until every one of them is fed off.

I have managed to get a retinol to work for me without freaking my skin out, but I have to be veeeerrry careful with exfoliants or I can throw my skin into a month long freak out. (Not suggesting retinol for you, just letting you know my routine) I have found that using a Foreo Luna once or twice a week keeps me from having any flakiness but doesn’t over exfoliate. You use it with your regular cleanser, so it isn’t introducing a whole new product into the mix. It’s very gentle exfoliation and deeper cleansing without overdoing it. I also suggest azeliac acid as another option. I use one by The Ordinary, and it was the final piece of my skincare puzzle. It’s very gentle, can be used daily (for most people, but always phase in ANYTHING new since you’re sensitive), and it really improves skin texture. Here’s the link for both:

>Unless you think soldiers will be willing to gun down civilians assembling because they’re ordered to I don’t see how you reach this conclusion.

This is the key point of your comment, every dictatorship scenario eventually comes down to this, there's 3 outcomes:

- The military sticks unanimously with their leader (either due to fear or because they actually believe in him), and the population would be able to do nothing about it even if they were armed (North Korea is a good example of fear, and you also have examples of the tiananmen square massacre where soldiers did not hesitate to kill anyone).

- The military starts falling apart because soldiers don't just blindly follow their leader and refuse to gun down civillians during a revolution (this was the case in my country, Portugal, back in 1974, where the population protested and put flowers on the barrels of the military men's guns, who refused to fire because they cared about the people).

- An extreme scenario that rarely happens, third party intervention (for example Hitler being stopped because there was a literal world war, not because the german military turned on him).

If anything, I'd argue an armed population is even less likely to overthrow a democracy, since it's a lot easier to convince the military to gun down civilians if the civilians are armed and trying to kill them.

Having guns wouldn't change any of these 3 scenarios if they happened. It would only make scenario number 1 more likely.",1688169745.0

As a reminder to commenting users, “Vent/Rant” posts are here to give our subscribers a safe place to vent their frustrations at an uncaring world to a supportive place of people who “get it”.  Vents do not need to be fair.  They do not need to be articulate.  They do not need to be factual.  They just need to be honest.

Unlike most of the content on this subreddit, Vents should not be considered advice threads.  In most cases it is not appropriate to try to give the Submitter advice on their issue.  In no circumstances is it appropriate to tell them “why they are wrong” or to criticise them, their decisions, values, or anything else.  If there are aspects of their situation that they are able to directly address themselves, the submitter can always make a new thread with a different flair asking for help once they are ready to tackle the issue.

Vents are an emotional outlet, not an academic conversation.  Appropriate replies in these threads are offering support, sharing similar experiences/grievances, offering condolences, or simply letting the Submitter know that they were heard.

As always, if there are inappropriate comments please downvote them, REPORT them to the mods, and move on without responding to them.

To the Submitter, if you DO want discussion to be focused on resolving your situation, rather than supporting you emotionally, please change the flair of this post, and then report this comment so we can remove it.  Thank you.

Again you’re missing what he was saying. You’re hyper focused on nuclear families for some weird reason. It wasn’t even the point he was making. 

He wasn’t talking about nuclear families he was talking about the era that Walsh is obsessed with which happened to have an association with the nuclear family. 

You know, we’re minorities couldn’t use the same drinking fountain or bathrooms as whites people. Where women couldn’t divorce men no matter what, when women couldn’t get jobs. 

It’s like “Germany needs to go back to the good old days when you could freely say the things you think at bars” 

And then you going “bars are amazing they’ve only help society, nothing is wrong with bars, here’s studies to why bars help the world “

"WritingPrompts","t5_2s3nb","The alert blares from my phone alerting me that a nuclear device will be detonated in my area within the next 10 minutes and all I can think of is “well fuck”. It’s summer holiday, the kids are home from school and dad and I have been off from work since his second confirmation of cancer, having moved from his lymph nodes to his urethra. We’d already had the talk before about what we would do if the worst were to happen, if he were to die. But none of those conversations had ever entailed what we would do in a situation like this. We looked to each other and got to work fast. Dad packed as much canned food as he could into three suitcases while I packed the clothes, birth certificates, all of the old money we kept in the safe, and enough clothes to last a week. Then we packed all of our guns into the car and drove to the old school just a couple of miles from town. There was a storm shelter built into the old one room schoolhouse that dad knew about because he had gone to school there. Our plan was to wait there. We weren’t the only ones on the road that day, but we appeared to be the only ones headed that direction as the counter ticked down. There was but three minutes left by the time dad had shot the lock to the storm shelter and grabbed an old piece of wood to jam into the doors as all four of us crammed inside. It was dark and cold, with nothing to do but wait as the timer kept ticking. I held our children close as I rocked them, trying to keep their fear at bay while my own strangled my throat. When the last ten seconds were being counted down we hunkered together, a bundle of tears and “we’ll be ok” passed around. Five seconds, four, three, two, one. My heart dropped as the last second ticked away, only for nothing to happen. I looked to dad, confused as one minute passed, then ten, then 11. Dad cautiously went up to where his phone could get a signal and when he came down he was madder than I’d ever seen him in my life. Wordlessly he handed me the phone

“This test of the emergency alert system was brought to you by Oppenheimer, in theatres July 21st” I read aloud and then I laughed in a hysterical way “it was a fricking ad for a movie!”

Well I’d be having some choice words with whomever had this bright idea, and I’m sure we won’t be the only ones.",1688169746.0

One of my huge passions in life is creating space for, connecting with, and helping people. He’s a huge homebody and introvert who doesn’t enjoy going out almost ever. 9/10 times I go out I go alone, which I was ok with for a long time but now I just wish he wanted to spend time with me and witness and love me in those moments. I’m an entrepreneur and business owner with wild levels of ambition, he is completely comfortable with mediocrity, and is fine in his job that he’s not passionate about, and has no growth opportunities. He recently switched careers which I supported him through, but gave up the job search after a couple of months and settled on something not in the field because no one was getting back to him (IMO he put little effort in). We have a large age gap, and I recently decided I want to have kids in my mid 30’s. That would be fine if he took care of himself, but he doesn’t. I feel like his mom a lot of the time, and I don’t want to have a partner who can’t pull his weight when it comes to childcare and domestic labor. His mom doesn’t show me any love, and if anything has been super rude to me, and treats me like a placeholder. His dad is pretty lazy and his mom did (and does) everything for the family and household while also working FT and that’s what she expects of me as well. I’m passionate about growing, learning, and working hard to become a better version of myself, while he is quite stagnant and stuck in his ways, constantly saying things like “I am the way that I am”. I feel like I’ve surpassed him in emotional maturity and it’s hard to see him as an equal. Our intellectual conversations mainly consist of me talking and saying my ideas, and him agreeing with little input. I want to travel, and love learning about new people, cultures, and ways of life. He’d be content staying home 365 days a year. In hindsight, I should have realized a lot of this a long time ago, but I’m so comfortable with him, he’s a genuine person with a wonderful heart and I think that’s why I’ve stayed for so long.",1688169748.0

A few notes, if you post (or comment) in this subreddit and you have an OnlyFans account, or if you have posted links to OnlyFans elsewhere on Reddit, our automatic moderation bot will flag your account and you will be banned - we are kid-friendly and E-rated and due to the incessant spamming by literally hundreds of people before you, we've been forced to moderate this subreddit this way. This also includes accounts that post explicit content anywhere else on Reddit.


Please do not SPAM the group with reposts. This means posting a new pic when you've recently posted, or deleting your old post and reposting a new pic a day or two later, especially if you've not interacted with guessers in the first post (aka you're farming karma). We do notice, and that will result in a temporary or permanent ban, depending on how grouchy your mod team is that day.


Please REPORT comments on your post that are creepy, insulting, harassing, comment on your appearance (positive or negative) or otherwise shitty. We do take them seriously and will ban people who behave like this, with no exceptions.


We will delete any posts where we suspect you are posting someone else's photo. You will be banned and asked to provide a verification picture to remove the ban. (Screenshots are a big red flag).


Do not engage with trolls - two wrongs do not make a right. We do take action when comments/posts are reported... give us the time to review, we're not here 24/7.


Any other questions? You can always send your mod team a mail message.

"AmItheAsshole","t5_2xhvq","NTA. HOA dude was way out of line.

>Mailbox color violation

Have HOAs gone too far?

>a retired man who lives in the neighborhood recently volunteered to help the board enforce violations

Doesn't he have anything better to do with his retirement?

>He does a drive every few weeks to check up on houses

Not like we need to cut down on pointless polluting travel in order to mitigate impending climate disaster or anything.

>Before he made it up to my door the friend told me the HOA dude walks up to him and starts to ask him questions, says he is in direct violation of a hoa code. My friend tells him he does not live their and hoa dude does not buy it

Does HOA dude have no friends or visitors ever? Or even contractors doing work on his home? I'm baffled that he refused to believe your friend.

>When I open the door I hear HOA dude pulling the ""do you know who I am card.""

To which your friends response was presumably ""no, I don't"".

>Hes raising his voice

Time to call the cops about an angry, threatening man on your property?

>when I but in, also not knowing much about him. He goes off about the mailbox to me and how its making the neighborhood look bad.

It's. A. Mailbox.

>Dude started to cover his tracks to me saying that my friend was the one with the attitude and sarcastically answering questions and was ""full of shit"".

HOA dude better hope none of this got recorded. Yelling at strangers and swearing at teens isn't a great look.

>I asked my mom on what to do and she said its up to me since im adult now. Im leaning towards reporting the guy due to his condescending tone, unprofessional behavior and raising his voice at my friend who was genuinely just very confused about whats going on.

I think he deserves to be reported. The only purpose of his job is to immiserate people, and his approach to it is bringing the community into disrepute. I understand if you don't want the hassle and risk, though. The HOA board could easily close ranks or even retaliate against you and your mom.

>I dont think he even knows what a HOA is.

Truly, ignorance is sometimes bliss.

>My friend and I joked about it once he left but still I dont want another person in our neighborhood to get yelled at like that.

You're a good neighbor.

>I wish one of us had taken a video to show as evidence of behavior

I wish you had too.

There’s no way to know if Carlos still has feeling for her so of course Valentine would be uncomfortable with that. 
And while Valentine is polyamorous, Carlos is not. So in Valentine’s mind it makes no sense for Carlos to remain friends with someone he had feelings for when he’s in a committed relationship.

Also, the withdraws can be pre-tax to reduce their taxable income.

 The benefit to graduates would be less stress about making monthly payments regardless of their employment status (payments are deferred if they're unemployed), removal of rigid payment amounts and schedules (higher wages = loans paid off sooner), and a shifting of their financial burden to budgeting around a predictably reduced paycheck.",1688169751.0

"AutismTranslated","t5_zlszm","On another note, I feel like I’m becoming more and more aware of the fact that I’m very likely autistic with each passing day. Hell, with each passing minute even. It’s like the floodgates have opened up now that I’ve vocalized the thought, “I think I might be autistic” to someone other than myself.

Signs from throughout my life have been racing through my mind. To the point where I keep thinking, “How did I miss that?” But I don’t think I did miss them. I just think I rationalized them all away as “quirks,” “growing pains,” and “typical anxieties“ and fell back into my usual stream of negative self-talk.

It’s overwhelming. I feel overwhelmed right now. One minute I’m almost “giddy” or buzzing with energy, and the next I’m crying for reasons I can’t quite understand. And then sometimes the emotions come on all at once. Wild. I also have an intense urge to share right now (hence this follow-up), which is not a feeling I’m used to. (Yet at the same time I feel my usual discomfort at divulging my personal feelings right now, even to strangers on the internet.)

So I guess I’m saying I don’t feel embarrassed anymore. I’m glad I mentioned the fact that I think I have autism spectrum disorder.

And thanks for the supportive comments.",1688169752.0

I was living alone and no one was there, so I know that no else could’ve put it there. There were no traces of poop around the room so I definitely couldn’t have brought it from somewhere else. 

I also checked my butt and legs to see if it was dirty because at that point I had started seriously questioning my sanity lmao, but it was all perfectly clean.

I never understood ppl that say that certain dogs and dog breeds are ugly… all dogs are gorgeous in their own way and their souls are beautiful and that outshines and compliments any physical quirks. 

In fact, people of all sorts can be viewed as beautiful as well, no matter what they “look like.” Truly beautiful souls always shine through and make everything else not matter. If the world could figure this out, there would be beauty everywhere. Anyways, I digress…

I hope your gf is not superficial and can see past the physical. We are all just souls trying to make it here in the physical bodies we are born into… bodies that age and die…

So he can direct traffic. Thats where you stand when you direct traffic. If a cop is standing in the corner everyone in the world, except you, would think hes blocking only that lane.

>Their speed has a lot to do with it, its the reason he should of seen them, they weren't blazing down the road at 80 so they were thousands of feet from the intersection, they were cruising at 15-20 and at the intersection just as biker came into view, (with lights and sirens on, work on your situational awareness if you are that deaf).

Glad you admit its the cops fault and he was in the wrong for tackling someone.

>They aren't going to immediately slam on their brakes, but they need to increase their awareness for where the lights and sirens are coming from.

Again, you need to give someone more than 2 seconds to assess their surrounding before you tackle them.  So the cop was in the wrong again.

>If there is a traffic officer you DO NOT PAY ATTENTION TO THE LIGHTS. that is why they are there.

The cop isnt directing traffic though, hes just standing in the corner watching the bikes ride by.

You have engaged in proselytizing or other religious activities on my property without permission.
You have threatened or harassed me or my family members.

"XboxSeriesX","t5_2ac5sx","> Why does everyone here WANT this deal? I’d rather Microsoft not absorb every studio it can tbh.

The people who know that ABK wants to sell are probably the ones rooting for Microsoft to be the buyer because of Microsoft’s years-long track-record of putting their games on the widest variety of devices on day one at the lowest cost to the consumer. No other potential buyer has that reputation or policy.

Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from advertising spam, ban evasions and abuse, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions, you need to build up some post, comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our subreddit rules:
   
>/r/memes/about/rules

>r/memes/about/sidebar

In order to achieve the threshold, we ask you to post to other subs around Reddit, and contribute in comments to build up your post and comment karma. You can hover over your karma on your profile to see the difference between post and comment karma, as we do **not** evaluate your overall karma. This may explain why you often see someone with ""lower"" overall karma able to post. *You are welcome to comment in r/memes* in order to spend some time getting to know our community, then you'll be welcome to make submissions.

1\. No, the bot did not make a mistake. The bot is excellent at counting.

2\. When the bot stops removing your posts, you'll know that you've finally met our requirements.

3\. We will not tell you how much karma you need.

I've seen other profiles where people do this as a couple and I'm more comfortable with that since it's all disclosed up front.

Which is the winning strategy? 

A. Investing in something that has a rate of return of 10% for the next 15 years and then declines by 1% per year for 5 years and then declines by 0.5% per year for the next 10 years

B. Investing in something that has a rate of return of 5% every year.

Keep in mind, you can swap investment strategies partway through. 

A is the clear winning strategy - shell and other oil majors can invest in oil until projected returns decline to the point of parity with renewables and then swap to investing in renewables, and they'll have made a shitload more money in the front end - enough to simply buy out the renewable companies if they wish.",1688169755.0

Tre shot more FTs last year than Tyus ever has, and is a very, very good FT shooter--suggesting, along with the three point data, that he's going to get there as a shooter. He drew twice as many shooting fouls last year than Tyus has ever done in his career, which tells you something about his ability going to the rim, which is far better than Tyus' has ever been. He took as many charges last year as Tyus has taken in the last 6 seasons combined.

You just described soo many wars, it’s not that unique. 


>Just so were clear, what exactly do you want to see Canada and NATO do about this invasion?


Canada is not united with other NATO countries on how to deal with the invasion. 


The EU is pretty well united (excluding a few oddballs), because this is a war in their backyard. They suffered directly as the result of the invasion, whether its the refugees or energy crisis. 


The USA will remain the police of the world because we want them to. 


While the rest of NATO begins to re-arm, re-tool and prepare to deter a potential large scale conventional conflict, here we are arguing what’s the point of even having a military force to deter Russia when we can just outsource that to Ukraine. 


Never-mind hallowing the ghost of a military we currently have for Ukraine, for which I suspect we will never replace that equipment. 


I just want Canadians to make up their mind, because there is a very clear disconnect between the population, the government, and the international community about how to proceed with this.",1688169757.0

Presumably it handles them the same way most yeast does, which is to say it's probably less than ideal. I remember reading someone who tried to experiment with big temp swings and kveik when making beer, but given how fast the yeast works at high temps it's possible the fermentation was done in a day and never experienced the swings the poster subjected the brew to. I can say from person experience that my brews have tolerated swings between 70 to 80F with no noticable off flavors in a hydromel, but the 30 degree swing you're proposing is considerable

All of this is is to say, I'm not sure anyone really knows what will happen for you. If you report back you'll be doing us all a favor!

We have one ACCA and one CIMA chartered accountant based offshore and few more clerks. 

I will definitely look into what you have suggested. Would you say that the the chartered accountant must be resident in the U.K? 

I see you that you implied that this could perhaps be quite risky for the accountant joining us a director - why is this? Do you forsee that incorporating the articles in such a way could be seen as an illegal loophole?

1. People who were annoyed with how popular it was when it came out. Which I can understand. I get annoyed by songs and movies easily if they are hyped a lot and you’re sick of seeing them advertised/people talking about them. 

2. Problem who have never seen the movie. I’ve had multiple people in my life complain about the movie only to find out they never watched it. One of my friends was like that and I kept telling her “nope. It’s good. Try it.” Finally she did on a 6 hour flight because there wasn’t anything else she wanted to watch. She ended up watching it twice (three hour movie so she actually could on a 6 hour flight 🤣) crying a lot 🤣 and texting me once she landed “OH MY GOD YOU WERE RIGHT IM SO MAD I NEVER WATCHED THIS”",1688169759.0

"fatlogic","t5_2wyxm","To be honest, I don’t think intuitive eating is the best option for 95% of modern population, not just for people with eating disorders. Maybe it works in a magical land where all kinds of food cost the same amount and take the same amount of effort to get/prepare, but we don’t live in such a world. E.g. I might intuitively choose well-prepared healthy food over unhealthy food, but when the unhealthy food doesn’t require effort then I will gravitate towards it. Potentially subconsciously, which will also mean intuitively. 

If I am tired and cranky after spending an hour cooking a healthy meal, then guess what, I will “intuitively” avoid that healthy meal. I will genuinely listen to my tired body and say “f cooking”. 

Unless you have a private chef or a health conscious partner who cooks for you or something, you have to use your brain while deciding what you eat, and can’t just “listen to your magical intuition”. Our intuition integrates all kinds of input, not just pure feedback from our body. Let alone the fact that a lot of food feedback can be delayed by hours/week/months before we actually feel negative or positive consequences in our bodies.",1688169759.0

"AstralProjection","t5_2rylp","Thanks for sharing your experiences! Here is what I know.

It’s my belief through my experience. Is that we all project. Probably quite often. It happens more as a child. And the work we do here in astral projection, is t really to project, but to remember them. To connect the dreams. The dreams of the physical realm caught in time, and the dreams in the astral caught free of time and “space”. Space meaning the physical plane.

The book “the illusion of method” helps you connect with your inner subconscious being. And that can bring awareness to your mind.

There are also different levels of awareness or remembering when we astral. Sometimes it’s more real then the physical and other times it’s hazy. 

Please note. A year ago when I personally started this journey. I was an atheist and a material world, science only kind of thinker. But now I fully feel and know of the inner being/god/subconscious mind. I started because I just wanted to see my dad in a dream.

Even thinking it wasn’t “real” I just needed to see him after he died. But what I found on the path was more valuable then all the riches in this earth. You don’t have to have an open mind. Just try.

Learn techniques, read books and read and study all the top posts on here.

You are, from your post, a naturally gifted projector. And also that’s really common with people with trauma. For some reason trauma and pain cracks the door open for many of us. Almost like the power or energy of the emotion does the work.

So what you need to learn with knowledge, is how to practice. How to navigate. And how to remember them.

After you get the hang of it, the cost goes way up from there.

"SexAddiction","t5_31933","Hi, I'm GFR and I'm a recovering sex addict. It took me around a year of trying to stop to accept I was a sex addict. First off, nobody here is qualified to diagnose anyone as a sex addict based off a Reddit post. None of us know you personally. Instead, I'll share my experience that led me to conclude I am a sex addict.

For a long time, the behaviors I became addicted to caused no issues at all. They didn't affect my life. Since I really enjoyed engaging in them, and nobody got hurt, I had no reason to stop. This went on for several years. I got to the point  where my life circumstances changed, and it was time to stop or else I'd lose my marriage. I love my spouse, but my behaviors progressed to the point where they were now affecting my marriage. That's when things got interesting. 

First off, I realized that I could not stop despite my honest desire to do so. Despite my best intentions, I always seemed to wind up in the same place over and over. Some strange phenomena seemed to happen:

1. My mind came up with reasons to act out again. Once the urgency to stop died down, my mind justified using only a little bit, even though it wasn't a little bit. 
2. Sometimes I found there was almost zero rational thought happening prior to and during my acting out sprees. This happened despite nearly losing my marriage. 
3. I noticed that once thoughts of acting out formed in my mind, I slipped into this trance-like state where the only thing that seemed to matter was the next clip, the next profile, the next message etc. In this state, hours flew by like minutes. I noticed that once I started engaging in a behavior,  I couldn't seem to get enough. I'd tell myself to go to bed, but I couldn't pull away from the screen. This seemed to happen more often than not, which wasn't the case when I was younger.

I learned that sexual addiction is progressive in nature. Over a long period of time, I had to go to greater lengths to get the same effect I was used to. I learned that sexual behaviors were my drug, and I was addicted to the high I got from doing them. Here's the crazy part though - my mind was incapable of seeing the truth about my behavior. I had this capacity to compartmentalize everything so I was unable to see the full picture. It wasn't until my life started falling apart that I became willing to admit I have a problem and I needed help.

That's my story. I hope you find this helpful. Thanks for reading.",1688169762.0

The middle child barely made eye contact with me for 2 years because she thought we left them out those holidays. The damage those lies make is real and sad. I made her spill because she was not responding to texts for several years. She finally admitted that she had an issue because of those holidays but the reality is we were told that me and my sister weren’t allowed over to my dads house (this is what was final straw in my dad wanting to divorce her recently)! After we told them the truth and my dad corroborated, the relationship improved a hair. But I’m sure other lies and they are pretty cold towards us.",1688169762.0

"legaladvice","t5_2rawz","The debt having been sold doesn't make it any less valuable.  Your choices are to pay the debt, offer to negotiate a partial payment or an installment plan, or to not pay it and take a hit on your credit score and risk possibly being sued (if the debt is enough to make it worth the debt collector's time and effort to sue).  If they do sue, they will add interest and filing fees, so you may end up owing more.  I once had to pay a debt after the collector actually filed suit and I did end up having to pay the filing fees as well, but negotiated down some of the additional charges they were trying to tack on.  More often, they will just let it sit, mucking up your credit, and make occasional efforts to get you to pay.  


Debt collectors will often be willing to accept either a partial payment or installment plan (or both) because it's basically all upside for them if they collect anything at all (and they bought the debt for a fraction of its face value).  If you negotiate a partial payment, try to get them to agree (explicitly, preferably in writing) to mark the debt as ""Paid in Full"" rather than ""Paid as Agreed"" on your credit history.",1688169762.0

"fo76","t5_jrw25","There is a big 'bump' for a toon at Level 300 when more Legendary Perks unlock. And then that's it! So any toon Level 301 or whatever should be able to take on a Level 800 guy, there's really no difference in theory. Except the high-level player has probably seen way more serious weapons than you, heheh... so be polite.

When I hit Level 300 we partied, then I settled in for the long march to Level 500 which I believed to be the next tier. But there is no next tier and that's it (duh), not sure where I got that idea from... LoL

I have a couple of tricks that might help another player I guess? I use four types of weapons, and I perk the four weapon groups Basic/Expert/Master 1\* each. Thus all my weapons are covered with a grand total of only twelve stars. Because there are oh so many other delightful perks to run... 

Personally I have put all of my Legendary Perks, now maxed out, exclusively into SPECIAL! I have +5 to all my SPECIAL (except Charisma) because... oh so many delightful perks.

Oh - and I usually run 2\* Blocker but if your guy is dying a lot, you may need 3\*. Things like 3\* Blocker, 3\* Incisor and 5\* Adrenaline are great and they really work. So good luck to you friend, L8R",1688169762.0

I really struggle with this too. I'm trying to meet new people and be open to people who I'm not normally attracted to but it's not an easy battle. 

One really simple thing you can use as a practical tool is that many (if not most) women will find a way to let you know they like you. They will respect your time and not leave you always wondering where you stand. If you spend significant time with someone, go on a couple of dates or whatever and you still can't tell, I'd say definitely time to consider asking them. And be wary of who you instantly like and do some research about attachment styles and learn your own and that Will help a lot.",1688169763.0

"AmericaBad","t5_10gh3w","A war crime is a war crime you can’t justify it… dropping 2 Atomic bombs on cities of innocent people is completely indefensible.

The decision to use atomic bombs was fuelled not by strategy but by sheer inhumanity. The war was won before Hiroshima and the generals who dropped the bomb knew It.

“The use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender.… In being the first to use it, we…adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.” —Adm. William Leahy, Truman's Chief of Staff

“the Japanese position was hopeless even before the first atomic bomb fell, because the Japanese had lost control of their own air.” - The commanding general of the US Army Air Forces,  Henry “Hap” Arnold

“the atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan.”- Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz, the commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet

“the first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment…. It was a mistake to ever drop it…. [The scientists] had this toy, and they wanted to try it out, so they dropped it…” - Adm. William “Bull” Halsey Jr., the commander of the US Third Fleet

“Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives”. He later publicly declared, “It wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.”- Dwight Eisenhower

“the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.”- Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay, the head of the Twenty-First Bomber Command",1688169763.0

This position/environment is different, but is considerably more challenging in a sense. I recall often having to make the decision of—admitting how much I don’t know or just kind of avoiding teaching/engaging in certain things. I think….I have mild baby PTSD from often saying—I don’t know the answer or let’s look it up and appearing/feeling incompetent in my previous position—that I’m somewhat terrified that it’s going to be a repeat pattern where I *perceive* my students losing faith in my knowledge.

Also only buy used OEM off eBay or new aftermarket from SBT or WSM. 

All the China replacement crap is notorious for frying electronics as it’s not manufactured specifically for the machine. Look at the compatibility list on China starters and you’ll see what I mean. They list… ATV’s, Boats, Jet skis and dirt bikes which all have different requirements for voltage which is a red flag on its own.",1688169764.0

I understand why he said that you were not a good wife that night. You embarassed him in front on his brothers by pulling of his ..hat? And threw a tantrum FIRST. You don't even know why you were mad because it's not like he did anything wrong to you, but it seems that you just took your anger or frustration from the baby crying out on him. It sounds like he felt a bit hurt by that but he acted stupid as well. By demanding him to leave his brothers house you DID act like you were the man of the relationship and wear the pants. Things could have went differently if you just asked him to go home.

I don't find feeding the baby a good reason not to cook a meal for your husband. Just make sure his meal is prepared first or cook their meals at the same time so you have all the time to feed your baby AND have a happy husband who isn't grumpy because he's hungry from work. It's not that hard.. I feel like you both have different love styles hence why you may feel like his is childish or immature. He may want you to take care of him as well and be wifey to him. You don't have to do everything but atleast do something for him too.

As the man of the house.. he did come first. He is the leader of your pack. His needs do not come first before the baby though but yes, you and him were together first before the baby came along. Without him, you would not have this baby. Don't just disregard him now that the baby's here after he's helped you create this lovely child. I don't think that he is jealous of your baby.. I do feel that he feels very frustrated that you don't seem to even  try to understand where he's coming from and only call him a big baby.

"exmuslim","t5_2s7k2","""Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them. Indeed, Allah loves those who act justly.""
Surah [Al-Mumtahanah: 8]

But there are verses like this too:

""And kill them wherever you find them, and turn them out from where they have turned you out. And Al-Fitnah is worse than killing. And fight not with them at Al-Masjid-al-Haram (the sanctuary at Makkah), unless they (first) fight you there. But if they attack you, then kill them. Such is the recompense of the disbelievers."" 
[Al-Baqarah 191]

""O you who have believed, indeed the polytheists are unclean, so let them not approach al-Masjid al-Haram after this, their [final] year. And if you fear privation, Allah will enrich you from His bounty if He wills. Indeed, Allah is Knowing and Wise.""
[Al-Tawbah 28]

The example of those who were entrusted with the Torah and then did not take it on is like that of a donkey who carries volumes [of books]. Wretched is the example of the people who deny the signs of Allah. And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people.
[Surah Al-Jumuah 5]

""Or do you think that most of them hear or reason? They are not except like livestock. Rather, they are [even] more astray in [their] way.""
[Surah Al-Furqan 44]

""The example of those who disbelieve is like that of one who shouts at what hears nothing but calls and cries cattle or sheep - deaf, dumb and blind, so they do not understand.""
[Surah Al-Baqarah 171]

"avengedsevenfold","t5_2shpy","It's not bad and I don't hate it but it definitely feels like Sevenfold watered down and at their most basic. There's some good ones on there but I don't think there's anything on there that really grips me. It's a good gateway for new listeners as it's pretty accessible and wouldn't scare them away like anything off the Seventh Trumpet and a lot of Waking the Fallen. But at the same time that might be it's biggest issue. 

You'll have lots of gatekeepers saying casual listeners shouldn't be allowed. Casual listeners will definitely be more attracted to HTTK than the others so it'll get hit hard by gatekeepers. Again, personally I don't hate it but even I would choose other albums to introduce my friends to Sevenfold (White Album and City of Evil usually are good as they show their wild side but also their more mellow and accessible side. HTTK to me personally wouldn't explain to a newcomer why people love them so much.). So really I don't find much value in HTTK. Again it's not terrible bad and horrible. There's good music on there and I'd rather listen to it than the majority of pop music but it just doesn't feel like Sevenfold at their very best and trying to push the metal genre in some way.",1688169767.0

It’s a substituted amphetamine which means it has the structure of the amphetamine molecule, but the hydrogen atoms are replaced or substituted. So while methamphetamine is a type of amphetamine, it is not amphetamine (e.g. Adderall or Vyvanse) despite having fairly similar pharmacological profiles

The rush and longer duration comes from methamphetamines higher lipophilicity. The higher lipophilicity allows the molecule to cross the Blood Brain Barrier much more easily so it’s able to bypass the high concentrations of the MAO-A enzyme found in the liver and lungs

Whereas amphetamine has a lower lipophilicity so it can’t pass the BBB as easily. So more of it circulates in the blood and passes through the liver which allows MAO-A to break it down more readily

With AI, your smartphone, which is already amazingly useful for creative people on the go, is the ultimate creative assistant. I had it produce detailed outlines for a story idea I had and wanted help fleshing out. With all the help from just the free chatgpt app and copying and pasting the responses into my phone's notepad. I asked it to help me make an outline with a complex prompt describing the story idea I had already been developing for a while, and it just kicked my creative productivity into overdrive in like a matter of seconds. 

It was useful for helping decide on the names of my characters, how story arcs could play out, and what their names and relationships symbolize and how the themes I want to explore could potentially be fleshed out.

 It's all up to the user to make use of this immensely powerful new tool. We are no longer mere consumers, banish that word from the lexicon forevermore! There are endless potential applications for it, and people have only scratched the surface so far. I feel more empowered than ever as an aspiring writer. I won't ever use ChatGPT's output verbatim in my story, that would be lame, but it helped me bust through some tedious mental work in no time at all. Creative writing is all about making choices, and with chatgpt I could get it to brainstorm me a list of potential choices I could make to push the story along further, then narrow down on a few, it refines its output based on the new things I say, and it just keeps getting better, but it falls short of actually being able to generate truly new ideas or great works of art. That's still on us to choose our adventure. 

Although I did have it brainstorm me lists of completely  new neologisms based on its exosting knowledge of suffixes and prefixes, and that was a fun exercise. Its suggestions weren't great, but they sparked an idea that I came up with, I shared it with ChatGPT, and it was like ""great job man, that's even better!"" Lol, it was nice and encouraging every step of the way, and constantly felt the need to stress that it had no preferences or emotions whatsoever yet it seemed content to help encourage this new story idea. I was thoroughly impressed with the brainstorming and outline session I had. 

Sorry I'm rambling, but I've just last night had this amazing interaction with ChatGPT and I'm still excited about it. Once everybody experiences how useful this new tool is, it's going to accelerate even more, and i'm guessing in far less predictable ways.",1688169769.0

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","#uh oh, reddit had a fucky-wucky because you are using it too much~

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that comment of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary comments from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your comment has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

And no, that comment will **not** be unremoved (unless the Reddit admins make a major U-turn), so don't bother asking.

In case you have a limited-scope question about a Technical Issue that may only require short and/or simple responses, please consider to instead post your question / request for help in the most recent [Weekly Technical Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Technical%20Help%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).  

This helps to keep subreddit and people's reddit feeds more readable and overseeable, and also makes it easier for the community to respond to such questions, which increases the chances that you get a fitting response to your question, since that thread is specifically made for Questions / Requests for Help about Issues with Hardware, System Requirements, Controllers / Keyboard / Input, Monitor / Screen / Widescreen, Visuals, Lag, Connection, Login, Errors, etc.

"stupidpol","t5_hitz3","Things always seem simpler to people not in a career, even if it's politics which is generally very visible. There's a reason why presidents very rarely just sign 100 executive orders on their first day and just spent the rest of their term defending their executive orders.  There are a shit-ton of important issues that people view as just as important or more important than student loan forgiveness, and, if we assume a president is very well intentioned and wants to do the most amount of good for the most amount of people^*, then that means he has to plan these things out right...this means tons of meetings and strategizing, spacing things out right, testing hte waters, drafting bills and executive orders, consulting with lawyers for plans and backup plans and backup-backup plans, whipping votes, making deals (""if you support plan X, I'll make sure your state gets funding for Y""), etc.    

As I explained in my other comment, Biden started speaking about student loan 
early on.  He tested the waters by forgiving many people's student loans.  He deferred student loan payments by years, waged a SCOTUS case, did an executive order, and still has other plans.  I don't really see why he's doing all this if it was ""just for the midterms"". The ""politician X only did this for the elections"" argument doesn't hold much water when we have elections every 2 years and the presidential election cycle itself is like a year and a half.

Biden is not a socialist and is a career politician, so I don't really trust him as a politician generally speaking, but shit, Nixon funded EPA, is it so crazy to think that Biden is pursuing the rather obvious policy goal of forgiving student loan forgiveness, a very popular policy amongst his core constituency and a policy that many economists agree with?

I just don't understand the kneejerk cynicism on this sub sometimes.

Edit: after looking at the legend a bit closer I think the airspace depicted in those boxes is specifically controlled areas. It seems any area not in a shaded area is just uncontrolled to 14,500 by default i think?

"PremierLeague","t5_2scup","When Salah finishes his career he’ll likely have more goals than Aguero… as a winger. 

Salah is the best winger in PL history and probably ends up in top 5 all time goalscorers, again, as a winger. 

Only person that comes close from the wing is Hazard in terms of ability. 

Stats aside I also think Aguero’s peak ability wouldn’t get him into the PL top 10 strikers.

Kane, Henry, Shearer, Cole, Suarez, Drogba, Rooney, Owen, Torres, Cantona, Fowler, Tevez

"fragrance","t5_2sda0","Arab countries love coffee and regularly drink it in the blistering heat. That doesn't necessarily mean hot coffee is a refreshing summer drink (I still drink it too, but...). I'm thinking it's more cultural than practical, if agarwood came from Canada things would probably be different. That said, there are some mainstream Western style summer fragrances that feature oud. For example it's a top note in Tom Ford's Costa Azzura. I think the fact that it's not sweet makes it pretty versatile, there are always exceptions to fragrance ""rules"".

There's also an economic factor. Designers would probably use it more if it wasn't so expensive, my understanding is that it eats up a lot of the quality ingredient budget. If it's not an oud-focused scent (heavy, warm) they probably want to use that budget elsewhere. For Tom Ford prices we get a little oud in our freshie as a treat. It's relatively cheap in the Middle East so there are a few companies there that simply make cheap clones of popular frags and add oud because they can.",1688169772.0

But that passivity, that desire to just work with grace, humility and decorum, is also what allowed republicans and the media to change the narrative, and blame so many things on Obama and have the public buy it. 

At least with Biden…I think his voting base will know without a doubt, who to blame for taking their rights away. If this happened under Obama, the GOP would successfully spin it as his fault.",1688169773.0

"ftmspunished","t5_addfp","ALERT! Here are some common issues with comments that may result in removal. It is also solid advice and doing you a favor if you were planning on just sending a few characters in response. It’s not too late to edit!

 - Too little effort: only saying “DM me.”

 - Too little consent: introducing a new kink without asking, that the OP did not reference. Try to aim for what seems like is being asked for. With something like a humiliation flair, yes, misgendering or body-shaming can be part of humiliation, but you don’t want to assume if it’s not referenced by OP.

 - Here’s how to horny-comment just right: your comment should interact with the kink (post, title, flair) and person (user flair, profile). If you’d like to play in DMs, you may ask if they’d like to chat further, or go ahead and DM them if they don’t say not to in their post, pinned posts, or bio. The OP can and may also DM you themselves if they like your comment.

"audiodrama","t5_2s7g2","I was thinking right along the same lines, but one of the reasons behind my supposition is that I think it might be the missing link to proving >!that the Matokah ritual is the Book of the Dead. During the 2nd Dynasty, the Matokah ritual would have produced more peaceful zombies possibly even ones who were fully submissive similar to voodoo. They would have functioned as a cheap workforce and integrated part of society as the mysterious 10th caste. They did not have a personal concept of death because they knew their body would still be showing up to work the next day. From that frame of reference the ritual of Ratak instead tells the story of how the arrival and forced zombification of these Tall People resulted in strife.  
What I'm spinning with right now comes when I combine that idea with the context provided by the graffiti and the second depiction of the afterlife coming from inside what would've been the zombie prison. Was it something about the Tall People which caused them to maintain sentience through the zombification process and did that lead to the fall of the empire? Possibly by becoming a ravenous horde during their internment?!<",1688169773.0

Such as?  According to overbuff (which is not exactly a reliable source of data) this month, in master and grandmaster Sym has the lowest pick rate. In diamond only Roadhog has a lower pick rate and win rate, and the reason why that is is pretty obvious.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Oh I'm simply exploring Christianity at the moment so I am not that knowledgeable unfortunately! I am taking some courses and being taught by some christian friends. But here is a nice passage about the relation between Jesus and the Father:

John 10:30-38

30 I and the Father are one.”  
  
31 Again his Jewish opponents picked up stones to stone him, 32 but Jesus said to them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?”  
  
33 “We are not stoning you for any good work,” they replied, “but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God.”  
  
34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your Law, ‘I have said you are “gods”’\[a\]? 35 If he called them ‘gods,’ to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside— 36 what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world? Why then do you accuse me of blasphemy because I said, ‘I am God’s Son’? 37 Do not believe me unless I do the works of my Father. 38 But if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I in the Father.”

On top of which, if I remember correctly, jesus was removing the sins of people, something only God can do.

This passage as well for me is quite interesting: Matthew 4:1-11

The Holy Spirit led Jesus into the desert to be tempted by the Devil. After forty days and nights without food, Jesus was hungry. The Devil tempted Jesus to turn stones into bread, to which he replied “Human beings cannot live on bread alone, but need every word God speaks.” The second temptation was for Jesus to throw himself from the highest point of the temple and order angels to catch him. Jesus replied “**Do not put the Lord your God to the test**.” Finally, the Devil offered Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in return for worshipping him. Jesus replied “**Worship the Lord your God and serve only him!**” The Devil left Jesus and angels came and served him.

And finally John 18:36:

Jesus said, “**My kingdom is not of this world**. If it were, my servants would fight to prevent my arrest by the Jewish leaders. But now my kingdom is from another place.”",1688169775.0

"LibbyandAbby","t5_298rgl","Just my opinion but I feel the defense is just trying to muddy the waters and get as far away from the actual murders as they can. If you remember, early on when RA was arrested, his lawyers said that they and RA were confused as to why he was arrested for these murders. His lawyers were also talking to any reporter that would stick a camera in their face and telling the public that the states case against RA was flimsy and they looked forward to proving his innocence. The gag order then came and that all stopped. 

A few months went by and we didn't hear much and then the bad conditions RA is in and how he is treated like a POW all started from his defense team. We see the photo of his stained shirt but find out he had just been on the yard and had a chance to change clothes but refused. The photo was taken shortly thereafter. He looks bewildered, makes sure his prison jumpsuit is undone  to his waist to show off the stained shirt and he also makes sure to put his cuffs/shackles in full view. That's all a strategy to get him moved closer to his lawyers so the defense doesn't have to make the 2 hour round trip to see him. They sent an intern to see him sometimes instead of going themselves. They just want convenience. Then we hear he is losing his mind, going on hunger strikes and refusing to sleep for days, breaks his tablet after KA abruptly ends the call when he admitted guilt, wets his Discovery and eats it, etc. RA is probably a control freak and the hunger strikes and refusing to sleep is really the last bit of control he has where he can control the situation and he knows it.  

RA and his lawyers saw the states evidence long before the public did. I feel that when they saw the evidence, him admitting he was there, witnesses see him before Libby and Abby get there and a witness see's him walking while wet, muddy, bloody and looked like he had been in a fight after the time of the murders. But not a single person saw him during the time of the murders. He admitted he was dressed similar to BG and was on the bridge. He admitted he owned that gun and nobody ever borrowed it. He parks at an odd location which is the abandoned CPS building and parks his car backed up to the building, maybe to hide his license plate? 

He has very good lawyers and in the beginning it was ""we and RA are confused why he is arrested"" and then its straight to motions about living conditions and mental incompetence. I just feel that the defense knows and RA knows he is done for and they started throwing shit at the wall to see what sticks. 

In my opinion, if RA is losing it mentally, it damn sure isn't because of living conditions. It's because he knows what the rest of his life will look like and how he really messed up, not only the victim's families but his own family. He doesn't have alcohol to cope with his problems anymore and I'm sure it's all very clear how he messed up his cozy little life because of one VERY stupid ass decision.",1688169776.0

Finding the path to your true self is a homecoming. I am also an artist. I have been mostly weaving  baskets and designing mandalas recently because I needed a more still repetitive practice. Repetition is very healing for people with trauma backgrounds.

I have read some of Jung's work however now read more philosophy and fiction that use mythology/archetypes. I find these more personal, accessible and interesting. Here are some books which have really helped me - they may or may not be for you and/or suit where you are at now in life.

Lol at you trying to affect a ""i dont care"" tone after that message. I called Sherman a war criminal who killed women and children, and you celebrated. I said that he killed southern children, you responded with ""I'm fine killing slavers."" I don't why I ever thought you were capable of making a point not rooted in slimey bullshit and frothing-at-the-mouth insults.

"shitposting","t5_2usxq","#uh oh, reddit had a fucky-wucky because you are using it too much~

As you are no doubt aware by now, the Reddit admins have decreed that the activities of [the average reddit user should only incur 4166 API calls in a single month](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/13wsiks/api_update_enterprise_level_tier_for_large_scale/jmmptma/). This amounts to up to a total of ~4166 combined upvotes/downvotes, posts looked at, media viewed (subreddit icons, profile pictures, post contents, adverts thrust upon thee, flair emojis, etc), notifications recieved, posts made, and comments made.

Therefore, to protecc the dewicate wittle fwower known as the weddit sewvews from the rampant overuse which you, by making that submission of yours, is subjecting them to, r/shitposting is trialling a brand new feature which will proactively prevent these unnecessary submissions from overwhelming the reddit servers.

This is why your submission has been arbitrarily removed - to ensure it cannot waste these pwecious API call responses which Reddit wants to charge a ludicrious amount of money for.

If you have any complaints, we would like to remind you that the Reddit admins (such as u/spez) are responsible for this change being enacted, and to direct all complaints to the reddit admins for fucking over reddit itself.

"forestry","t5_2s5wq","Depends.  So environmentalists will mention everything bad about old growth and forestry will mention everything good about it.

From a forestry perspective each year the tree adds a ring.  So you'll either end up with large trees with spaced out rings or a bunch of tight rings.  Tighter rings mean stronger wood, a s bigger rings mean bigger wood.

Usually bigger wood makes fancy products which are large and not glued together.  So fancy furniture or doors.  Because this wood is rare and the products made are expensive there is an economic advantage to this wood and it sells for a premium.

Stronger wood is better for building stuff, which also sells for a premium.

So old growth is better wood but typically old forests are spaced further apart so you have to cut more ha to get the same amount.  However, you can cut less trees down and get more wood per tree so it makes harvesting more efficient.  

You can also just glue small wood together.  Which also makes a strong product.

The environmentalists perspective is you get monoculture from replanting the same tree after logging.  Then there are soil issues as if there's no longer trees to keep the nutrients in it can all wash away.  Usually though they leave the stumps which keep nutrients in.  Sometimes there are issues with streams as fallen timber in streams causes fish issues or landslides hurts migrating fish and it raises the temperatures of the streams (trees provide shade)

Then there is measures from forestry to combat these issues such as leaving patches of old growth, (not logging all of it) replanting different species and different genetics.  Storing genetics in databases.  Leaving trees around streams.

Then there are some issues where forestry and environmentalists are on the same side such as forestry being a store of carbon in lumber.  So idea is tree sucks up carbon, then you build stuff and it stores the carbon until you need to rebuild the stuff.  And then you replant to suck up more carbon to help make forestry carbon neutral.  Other building materials such as concrete and rebar are leading causes of carbon emissions.  The very process of making concrete releases co2, there's no way to reverse that it's literally in the chemical process.

So really there's just pros and cons, I think a balanced approach is ideal.",1688169779.0

"Entrepreneur","t5_2qldo","If you live near a good college or have the chance to go to college, definitely go. I can't stress enough how much environment plays a role in your development and success. You gotta find proximity to where you wanna be in life and imo, college is the best way because there's such a mix of people there. I also come from a low-income family and was able to get scholarships and grants which helped reduce my financial burdens. My college had a mix of young/old rich/poor people and also my college had a lot of technology and resources that we could use. There were also student clubs, some of which were entrepreneurship-focused. I really wish I had taken advantage of that more and made connections. But unfortunately, I was very insecure, not confident, and had a lot of mental and family issues.

Now that I'm older, working on myself, in therapy, and in my career, networking and socializing really is how you'll get somewhere. So learn how to do that in college! And remember to have fun too! Don’t just be all work and no fun because when you get older, your body just starts to break down like a car and you always have to maintain it lol

It doesn't hurt to invest either but it's not gonna make much of a dent if you don't have a lot of money to invest in the first place so work on your hard and soft skills. I invested during college and although I made like 200-300% gains with each stock, it didn't make much of a difference because I didn't have a lot of money to put in anyways

We did quite a few tests on him to rule out more serious possibilities, so definitely work with your vet, but I think our guy just has an exceptionally sensitive belly. 

As for the runs… I gave him monthly baths and kept the area around his butthole trimmed with clippers. I got a rec from a Samoyed owner to use ear wipes to get discolored butt hair whiter, and that helped; we keep baby wipes by the backdoor and any time there’s a poop, we wipe.

Women believe they can get whatever they want because frankly they can get an easy hookup anytime no matter their looks and status. So anticipate single moms are getting DMd and railed constantly and therefore have a totally inflated sense of their sexual/social market value. Women with no kids are picky and you lose to any man with no kids. 

Looks, money, brilliance, humor, connections - they won’t help. 

I got 25 years of non-stop female attention. It’s gone now. I gave up on women and dating. Life is what it is. The other option would be give up custody in favor of dating - that’s a horrible choice imho. 

Sorry, but that’s the brutal reality, and I batted 100 with extremely desirable women for decades.

As for where they haven't passed a federal law on abortion I don't think they could realistically or legally. It's too politicized of a topic here you would never get enough Republicans to vote for it. And that's taking in that the majority of Americans by numbers would support some form of abortion legislation. So since that won't happen like with many things it comes down to the States and every individual state gets to make that decision either by allowing their citizens to vote or simply passing legislation. The reason that the federal government couldn't pass that law legally actually has to do with the 10th amendment which says that anything that isn't specifically mentioned in the Constitution is an issue that needs to be deferred to the states. Obviously hundreds of years ago they did not put abortion anywhere in the Constitution. Hypothetically you could get a specific constitutional amendment through that protected abortion however that requires 2/3 of both houses of Congress to even consider an amendment and then 3/4 of states have to agree on set amendment.

John 14:15-17: In this passage, Jesus promises to send the Holy Spirit as a Helper or Advocate to be with His disciples forever. Here, Jesus refers to the Holy Spirit as ""another Helper,"" indicating that the Holy Spirit is distinct from Himself and the Father.

You get a continual supply of cooler air and more consistently and efficiently disperse the waste heat.

The Court of Appeals specifically addressed your claim, saying ""We disagree. We conclude that the Commission’s order merely requires that Masterpiece not discriminate against potential customers in violation of CADA and that such conduct, even if compelled by the government, is not sufficiently expressive to warrant First Amendment protections.""

They note also that ""Phillips refused to prepare a cake for Craig and Mullins before any discussion of the cake’s design"" and later ""We note, again, that Phillips denied Craig’s and Mullins’ request without any discussion regarding the wedding cake’s design or any possible written inscriptions"".

However, my advice is to not worry about labels. Labels are just neat little boxes and people can get so invested in being in the neat little box that they cut themselves off from just enjoying life and seeking what is actually comfortable for them. So, do what feels good, what feels comfortable, what feels authentic, and the right label will reveal itself. If you’re doing a lot of gender exploration, which it sounds like you are, you really are in an exploratory phase and not in a defining period. And as you explore much more may be revealed to you, but that is only going to come with time. And even things you thought were true for yourself may change. I’ve had gender fluid and trans masc friends who said they never wanted top surgery and then ended up getting top surgery, and I’ve had trans masc friends who debated taking T for 10 years before deciding that was the best decision for them. A couple of them didn’t want to always be read as men, and years later they are very comfortable always being read as men— but they take a very gender expansive approach to life and are very expressive in different ways with their clothes and accessories. Lots of things can shift and change. Just take it one day at a time, be yourself, and do what feels right.",1688169784.0

"Makeup","t5_2qrwc","What a wonderful gift for your mom! I am of that age with light skin and prefer the no makeup look. This is what I use and would recommend:

**Foundation:** 

\- Clinique Even Better Makeup. Lovely light to medium coverage and very natural looking. Good for all skin types.

**Brows:**

\- This is something I personally don't splurge on because I find drugstore products are just as good. I use NYX and ELF. If you want to gift something luxe, Anastasia Beverly Hills or Benefit are the go to for brow products.

**Eye Shadow:**

\- This is something I will pay for quality! Charlotte Tilbury Eyes to Mezmerize in Oyster Pearl for an everyday, versatile look, or Champagne for a no makeup look. I only wear creams (or some powder metallics) now because matte powders are very aging.

\- An alternative would be Bobbi Brown or Laura Mercier Eyeshadow Sticks. Bobbi Brown has some dual ended shadow sticks that would be a nice gift.

**Mascara:**

\- Tower 28 for volume, or Rare Beauty for a more natural look. I also love Clinique High Impact.

**Blush:**

\- Cream looks more natural. There are lots of great options. Merit Flush Balm, Tower 28 Beach Please, LYS Higher Standard Satin Matte Cream Blush, Bobbi Brown Pot Rouge, NARS The Multiple.

\- Drugstore options are Honest Beauty or Milani.

**Lip Product:**

\- If you want to go all out for something special, Dior Glow Oil or YSL Shine Lipstick Balm. Other high end options, Merit Lip Oil, NARS Afterglow Balm, Tarte Maracuja Juicy Lip, Bobbi Brown Extra Lip Tint, Bobbi Brown Crush Infused Gloss.

\- Mid range options, Clinque Chubby Stick Moisturizing Balm, MAC Lustre Glass Sheer Lipstick, Fenty Gloss Bomb.",1688169786.0

"Eve","t5_2qil9","Many years ago CCP added a trade good livestock item called a fedo. They then gave one to everyone for free. It looks some what like a slug with legs. 

The in game item description:

> The Fedo is an omnivorous, sponge-like creature. It has reddish skin and numerous small claw-like tentacles which it uses to move around and protect itself. A primitive being, the Fedo's method of eating and absorbing nutrition is slow and inefficient. This means that food stays for a long time in the Fedo's body, and will most often have rotted or turned foul before the animal passes it out of its system. The Fedos eject fumes from their body which, for the reasons explained above, have a most horrible odor. The Fedos possess a fantastic sense of smell and so use these fumes to communicate with each other; they are however both blind and deaf, having no eyes or ears. The mouth is located on the underside of the beast, and the Fedo feeds by positioning itself over the food and lowering itself down on it.",1688169786.0

Maxed out hours and always the same pay, or in my experience it goes down with frequent no shows and cancelations in that industry so the therapist is giving you a whole effing lot for very little in return.

Radio stations would just play your music because everyone knew about you. Nowadays every artist is just 1 tiktok from being in everyone’s ears. More artists are given a chance nowadays than in the past which in my opinion makes it much more impressive for those artists that for so long manage to keep their standing in music popularity for multiple album cycles.

I understand you’re hurt.  I understand you need to protect yourself, but don’t be an ass about it.  I hate all these “fuck them over as much as possible!” comments.  It’s immature honestly.  The only concerns you should have is that you get what you deserve (within reason! Trying to purposefully fuck someone over isn’t reasonable!) and protect your kids.  Everything else is just you lashing out because you’re mad.  And as they say “hurt people hurt people.”  But you can do better and go to therapy or whatever you need to get through this with a level head.  

The fact that she doesn’t want but visitation rights and seems like she wants out of everything in her life doesn’t sound like just cheating to me.  It sounds like a mental breakdown or depression.  I’ve battled depression my whole life and it feels exactly like that.  An overpowering feeling of needing to escape, all means necessary and no longer wanting to live the life you live, be it be changing your life drastically in the attempt to feel better or by ending your life completely.  So while cheating may also be occurring, if you have any love for her at all, I would try to check in on her mentally.  She could very well be just an awful human who is cheating and wants to dump her family.  I don’t know her.  But if this seems like it’s not the woman you married, I’d seriously check in with her and try couples’ counseling.  She may just really need support right now before she goes off the deep end.  She sounds extremely stressed too if she’s the sole earner in the family.  She might be triggered.  And while I understand if cheating is a firm like crossing and no coming back kind of act, it might be also healing for you to find out the reason why if she is actually cheating.  Some people with mental health issues cheat when they normally wouldn’t if they weren’t having mental health issues.  The reasons can be varied like serotonin chasing (i suggest looking it up if you don’t know what that means), feeling like her life is uncontrollably spiraling and she needs a sense of control, or since she’s not getting sex at home (again, not your fault but a possible additional reason to the mental decline) the only way she feels loved at the moment is through someone loving on her physically.  None of this would be your fault unless you really haven’t been all that attentive to her needs as a partner in life.  But either way, cheating—while not okay—isn’t always so “she/he’s an awful human being doing this solely to hurt you and fuck you over.”  Many times it’s a result/symptom of bad mental health and/or is a sort of plea for help.  

Again, you have every right to consider it a total dealbreaker.  But I do ask you to be kind still.  Work through the pain and feelings you have and don’t bring them to the divorce.  Make sure your kids are taken care of first and foremost and try to not act in anger towards your wife.  

As a kid of a messy and angry divorce at a young age I can tell you that it messed me up so much.  Of course I agree with my parents divorcing.  Parents should never stay together just for the kids since it shows them untrue love and a dysfunctional example of love that they then might fall into since that’s what their role models did.  But parents should NEVER be angry towards each other in front of the kids.  The kids shouldn’t be the collateral damage in your divorce.  And while it’s okay to explain in the future if it’s true like “Mommy and daddy aren’t together because mommy chose to love someone else over daddy,” any anger frustration or negative emotion should be hidden from the children.  Don’t make them talk between you two.  Don’t let them see the hurt and the pain and the lashing out.  Because it may be nice for you but it will mess up your kids.  And that is an asshole move.

Also, I believe this for ALL divorces, regardless of which person is the SAHP or cheating or whatever.  It’s not an extra sympathetic to the women opinion.  I truly believe women who try to fuck over their husbands in divorce are equally scummy people.",1688169787.0

The USA has a long and proud tradition of making our futures and fortunes by hard work and self sacrifice. The problem has become, and has been for several decades now, we are no longer making ourselves prosperous but rather benefiting large corporations. And we're brainwashed to think it's good to sacrifice so much to them. 

The mindset that helped my parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents prosper in the early 1900s through the mid-80s hasn't been good for the family since the mid 90s. We've tipped, in the USA at least, passed capitalism (which was arguably beneficial for the entire global community) into what I consider corporatism (and I think it is going to be the death knell of my country).",1688169787.0

Its cool if you want to be a blind Oda fanboy but you have to accept that many many people actually have critical faculties and good taste and can recognise terribly written characters when they see one.

You literally haven’t given a single counterargument to any of my points because you know deep down that I’m right about everything I said. Kaido is a hollow, badly written piece of trash that doesn’t even land in the top 100 best manga villains.

"TalkTherapy","t5_39dpu","Damn. There's a lot here. I'll try to address a few things you said based on my own personal experience in therapy and you do with it what you will. (Take it or leave it, I guess.)

>Therapy doesn’t solve one’s problems, change one’s life circumstances or one’s brain function’s 

I sort of hate this take. It's not wrong, but it's reductive and it really puts a lot of pressure on people who may not be ready or even *want* to make changes in their life yet. I think I see therapy more as a space for you to figure your own thoughts, feelings, and ideas out and your therapist provides that space and helps facilitate that process in a unique way, free from judgement and with a compassionate ear. What I get from therapy is largely support and a place for me to feel uncomfortable feelings in a way that isn't so lonely, and every once in a while I'll get some new insight into who I am as a person that may or may not change my perspective or outlook on things. I don't get ""coping strategies"", solutions, advice, homework, or anything like that. I know I wouldn't listen to them or do them even if I did. 

>There is no internal reason, need or wish to “improve” or do anything with my life.

Honestly, same. I'm not actively suicidal, but I definitely have a large part of me that doesn't want to be alive. That's just the truth and I'm very open about this with my therapist. What's great about her is that she provides space for me to feel that ambivalence towards life. And weirdly, just having her give me that and letting me talk about how I don't want to live without her making a big deal about it in turn helps me feel better. It's fucking weird. But that's just been my own personal experience, YMMV. I actually made a comment about it on another thread recently:  [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkTherapy/comments/14cheu7/is_anyone_else_unable_to_do_their_therapy_because/jokt1s1?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

>BUT ISNT WANTING TO DIE AND NOT PARTICIPATE IN THIS WORLD A LEGITIMATE CHOICE/WISH THEN?

I think, yes. My first therapist put it in a way that resonated with me. To paraphrase, he basically said that he views suicide as a personal choice, but the fact that I keep showing up to therapy (and haven't actually done it) means that there is at least *some* part of me that wants to live. I agree with that. I think by posting here, there is at least a small part of you that is at least interested in what therapy has to offer. 

The thing my therapist focuses on now is putting words to my feelings because she believes (and I agree) that if we don't talk about the uncomfortable things, we tend to act them out. What this looks like for me is punishing myself for things I've done or acting the part of messages I've internalized (like I'm lazy or incapable of whatever). And even though I'm consciously aware of this, I need to work through this on an emotional level, and frankly, that's just not something I can do alone - that's where the space of therapy comes into play for me. So all in all, even though I admit that I don't want to change yet, I'm not ready to, I want to keep punishing myself and believe I deserve that punishment, I'm trying to honor the other parts of me that still try and still have *some* belief that maybe it doesn't have to be this hard or this bad; the parts that are scared of dying because it might not be what I actually want deep down.

So, that's how I experience therapy - and I grew up with a *strong* anti-therapy stigma surrounding me so it took a bit to arrive at this perspective. But as I've continued to stick with therapy over the years, I have noticed that some things have gotten easier. Little by little the part of me that wants to live is growing. I don't see therapy as ""work"", I see it as something I like to do. I like my therapist; I trust her, I feel safe with her, I enjoy talking to her. Honestly, when so much else in my life sucks, it's kinda nice to have her around if for nothing else than to just feel a little less lonely.",1688169789.0

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","He was absolutely hilarious in his Sandy Hook trial. There was a moment where he pretty much confessed guilt straight up. He and his idiot lawyers in the process of discovery sent his complete phone records to the prosecution.

And when the prosecution said, ""I don't think you meant to send us this, would you like to withdrawal?"" They spent weeks not doing shit. By the time they would've acted, it was too late.

There's a beautiful video clip of Jones getting railed for it, in which he calls his prosecutor of having a ""Perry Mason"" moment. Which is just the worst admission of guilt as you could hope for.

"Supplements","t5_2qhb8",">I didn't mean it to be click bait. Dude look at my posts. Does it seem like I'm trying to farm for karma?

Motivation for clickbait doesn't need to be karma. Maybe you just want to cause a media scare. (Or legitimately overreacting.) The reason doesn't define what it is.

>I wrote cancer because what do carcinogens do? Cause cancer. But I realize it's still a very different thing and I was also probably drunk, stoned, and sleep deprived when I posted that and was being lazy dumb.

The strongest term ever used in this case is ""possible carcinogen"" (which is a lot level, below ""carcinogen"" and below ""probable carcinogen"" and the article is also careful to mention that it's the same category as mobile phones.

your reaction was over the top bad, but I've been in a relationship with a partner who repeatedly got me nothing or super low effort gifts for my birthday/christmas and what everyone seems to be missing is that it makes you feel shit, not because you didn't get anything good, but because it shows what they think you're worth. 

Being shown, through actions, that you're not worth the time, money, or effort to get a gift for a special occasion really drags down your self worth.

I F 16 and my boyfriend 16 have been together for a little over a month, and have seen each other often. We love and care for each other so much that the thought of losing him makes me sick, but now I did lose him. I got in an argument with my mom, and things had gotten pretty heated. She said how she wasn’t going to let me hangout with my boyfriend alone (P for privacy reasons) because she didn’t want me to be touched sexually. I told her in a very sarcastic way “oh yeah and he fingers me every night”, I assumed she had taken this as a sarcastic remark since I told her I would get pregnant. She did not take it as a joke, which I didn’t know at the time. Later into the evening she came into my room explaining how disrespectfully I had treated her. I agreed and apologised to my mom. It is important to mention that before this I had my phone taken away, but I did text and call R explaining I couldn’t talk to him until tomorrow because of my mom.

My mom tells me how she told my dad about it. I call my dad and he is relieved to hear that I have never been touched in any way before, but he informs me that he told P’s dad. P’s parents had one rule, don’t touch her, and now they believe that he broke it. He and his sister blocked me and removed me from every single thing (I don’t know if he did it or his parents). P’s dad told my dad that there will be no communication between P and I ever again. It’s the middle of the night and I check Snapchat and see the “x” (this is what you see when someone has blocked you), but I can’t click it because I need to see his name. I asked my two friends to tell him I love him, but they both had gotten blocked. No one has heard from him, they only saw blank and empty snaps which he never sends; I have no idea if his parents let him use his phone or someone is logged in to do his streaks.

I sent P’s parents a letter in the mail apologising and begging to let me see their son again. I have to mention this, P did touch me, and I write about it in my journal and sent him my journal to read. I know his parents went through our text messages, but I have no idea about Snapchat. Over text we had talked about the things we wanted to do with each other, and the things we already experienced. My dad and mom thinks it’s a joke that went horribly wrong, but I have no idea what his parents know. If he confessed to it and told them other things (like how I sent him a picture in my bra and underwear and the journals) then we are done done. Right now there is still a glimpse of hope with the letter I sent to his parents, but other than that the only thing I have been doing is crying and looking at pictures of us.

TL;DR I made a sarcastic joke to my mom about how my boyfriend had fingered me and now his parents think it’s true and cut off all communication between the two of us, but it is true, he did touch me and I have no idea if his parents believe it or not; my parents don’t know it’s true, and they can’t know or else I am done for.

I have some bad news for you.

You are married to an unhealthy and emotionally abusive person.  At the best, he's a passive aggressive.  I'm not going to play armchair psych and tell you what some of the worst options are.

Save yourself some angst and grief and start putting up your protective walls.  This person will never be safe for you to love.  If you take someone like this to counseling with you, you're going to be shell-shocked with what you see.  Don't do it.

ETA-one thing you should do starting today, since you're looking for advice, is to stop yourself from thinking of this person as an option for sex, love, socializing, romance, etc.  He doesn't want to have to sex with you?  Ok.  You don't want to have sex with him, trust us.  Good.  He doesn't want to have sex with you.  He doesn't want to be nice to you.  What does he want?  He wants to **punish** you.  Read that again and let yourself get angry about it.  Anger will help push down the sadness and will help you move on.",1688169790.0

"MHRise","t5_34tust","Great tips overall, for beginners worried about buff management the dual kinsect is a great way to avoid the hassle. I would like to add that there isn't really a need for earplugs as the orange + white buff gives u max earplugs and since red buff is one of the more obvious and easier buff to obtain (usually the head) I recommend the orange dual kinsect for beginners so the moment u hit a monster for the first time (aim for wings or feet) and absorb orange and white then u will be immune to the first roar for the free red.

However, once u are comfortable with the IG playstyle really give the new support kinsect a try as the better you are at aggression the less u will need to reset buffs.

Personally, I main IG in 4U, world and sunbreak. I'm by no means an expert on it but it's my go to weapon for any difficult challenges. It's a fun weapon that does great damage and has incredible mobility and options for avoiding damage. 

There's a lot of videos available for guides and the sunbreak meta build compilation has a really extensive break down on IG builds and combo that I highly recommend.

"relationships","t5_2qjvn","My opinion is that you should stay with your wife. Don’t expect the grass to be greener on the other side, a lot of times it’s actually not. One big reason I see is that your wife seems to be devoted to you in an unparalleled way, anyone new you meet will take years, years, to become as devoted.
Thing is, if you love your wife as you say, and you feel as though you can live together in harmony, then you have the perfect conditions to foster a loving and caring family. Yes that means you will sacrifice the opportunity to explore a life with this other woman, but as of now she is only a fantasy since you don’t know her. And fantasy can be very dangerous.
Also imagine in your future, how happy you will be that you get to age together with the woman who stuck by you when you were at your lowest. You two have a special kind of bond that won’t be the same if you go for a new partner.
Oh, and definitely talk to her that you feel regret about how you treated her for the first five years. This gives her a chance to understand you, and perhaps give a perspective that will make you cope with it. Relationships, and especially parenting, is all about communication and teamwork. I’d say that love partially turns into teamwork over time.",1688169791.0

They probably had a life before they met close to eachother otherwise they wouldn't have had a relationship in the first place.

He might even have started the fight to get her attention lol. I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, exes can be dangerous so don't let him get too close. From what I'm reading though your girlfriend seems trustworthy and it is normal to help someone you know when he/she is in a pinch.

Here are some nice quotes which might be calming:

* ""Live life as if everything is rigged in your favour"" - Rumi
* ""You are never destroyed by anyone except yourself"" - Friedrich Nietzsche
* ""I do what is mine to do, the rest does not disturb me"" - Marcus Aurelius
* ""To think too much is a disease"" - Fyodor Dostoevsky
* ""We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are"" - Anais Nin",1688169791.0

"Clobenzorex","t5_8nbhpk","Good, im glad you aren't naming the source of this drug.

I don't think it ever should be named, because it could, especially in a sub dedicated to it, get it taken off the place that markets It.



I don't think it's supposed to be taken before every meal.


If you took it before you at your evening dinner, it would keep you up.


Instead, i think its helpful to take it all at once in a day.


However, i have found a  only headache causing form of this, with the last Numbers on the foil pack being 143.


Anyway i am curious what the number on the foil packs say for you.

For me, it's always like 2301 14 something

It never changes..

What are your numbers on the foil pack, at the bottom of the back.?


I think that something is going on with the production of it that is producing a not fully formed clobenzorex molecule, leading to a headache



So far its only happened with ones that end in 143.


But if this is a legitimate pharma product shouldn't the numbers always change on the bottom?


Anyway,  its probably nothing.


But again, im curious if you could tell me what the last 3 numbers are in the number section.
Which is the left side of the bottom of the pack

The right side is the ""expiration date"" which i think always reads as Enero 2026(which is January)",1688169793.0

Might have actually been taken within the time frame of it actually failing. Which could be a small window of 4-12 hours. Pending on how long it took then to get your second draw of blood after saying you was in liver failure.   For example you went in today, they give you meds day one then day two or three they draw blood. See you have live failure do blood work again a day or two to later to double check liver is fine. So within a 1-5 day period. And by the time the second blood draw was taken shows a normal liver.

Your [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/14ngc04/my_m_20_girlfriend_f_21_is_acting_weird/) was removed for the following reason(s):

&nbsp;

> **It appears to ask for moral judgment or judgment on your actions.**

&nbsp;

Per our [moral judgment rule](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/ivahe5/meta_autoremoving_moral_judgment_threads_also/), any requests for moral judgment (generally any yes/no questions) will result in the removal of your post even if you ask for specific advice as well.

&nbsp;

Your post is a moral judgement if it contains any of the following:

* Is it normal?

* Is it right/wrong?

* Am I right/wrong?

* Any variation of “Am I The Asshole?”, including AITA

* Who is morally good here?

* Does anybody else...?

* Should I have done this…?

* Am I justified…?

* Would I be right to do...?

* Am I overreacting?

* Is this a big deal?

* Is this reasonable?

&nbsp;

Please remove any questions that ask for judgment of a situation and instead request specific advice that could not possibly result in a yes/no answer. Any variation of ""Am I The Asshole?"", including AITA, also falls under this rule.

If you are attempting to make posts that are unjerk or are serious (and likely angry-jerking), they will be removed.  While good content with poor titles is often upvoted, it's a waste of good content.  The highest upvoted posts on this sub repeatedly, consistently, without exception have non-serious, full-jerk titles.  Many, many, many examples of proper circle jerk have been provided in the sidebar links.  Just search ""circlejerk"" in the Reddit searchbar.

Do not attempt to message the mods.  **DO NOT ATTEMPT TO EVADE THIS FILTER OR YOU WILL BE BANNED INSTANTLY.**  We read the auto-moderation logs to determine if a filter is too tight.  In every single possible case, a full-jerk title will not be caught by the filter.

* Always refer to r/fuckcars as ""our undersub"" in titles
* Do not just title your post as a rant about r/fuckcars aka our undersub
* Come up with something full-jerk
* Do not make /unjerk or /uj post titles (discussion is what comments are for)

I could go to Rutgers(main campus) for $36k a year in state tuition including room and board. NJ is one of the highest cost of living states in the country. I’m sure it’s much cheaper in most of the country to go to a state university.

It has always been the case that if you decide to go out of state or well regarded private you will pay a premium. To do so now is clearly a terrible decision without significant scholarship or aid.

He doesn’t seem to care what women think of it. Claire mentions he had affairs even before the war from the early in their marriage. It isn’t just Claire’s opinion that he disregards. 

It will be interesting to learn what Frank knew. We already know he knew some things. We will find out he knew quite a bit more for sure. I wonder if he was surprised and dismayed that Claire wound up being one of the time travelers that I think he encountered earlier and possibly had evidence of their skill. I think a man like Frank prefers mysteries like time travel through ancient artifacts remain superstition and imagination not real. But he has the curiosity and intellectual discipline to pursue the clues. He protected Bree and I think he protected Claire too. He didn’t just do it for Bree.

"furniturerepair","t5_6tdrfq","the only problem with the colored sticks, even adding powder to the filler, it will never replicate the grain pattern of the wood, you would need a topical paint/pigments to truly recreate the grain through the repair to match the surrounding wood. So i just use gray bondo because i touch up over the filler in every repair i perform, so its concealed behind my touch up, therefore no need to add pigment or even use a colored filler.

adding reinforcement,  like staples or nail heads for filler to grasp onto better is a good idea for large areas, i do mention in the book!

if you don't french polish, how do you repair gouges and blend them in on, for instance, a nice mahogany table with a gloss sheen? you can't just spray that with a toner and have it blend with the surrounding finish?

yes, this is my sub, but it's really our sub, im just the custodian.  i have every aspect of furniture repair covered in the book, you can just click on of the links if interested, i even have a cheaper pdf version available for download, but a physical copy is probably better for reference.

You are pretending that all progressives wanted was for Biden to use the Higher Education act which is a half-truth. The *reason* they wanted him to use it is because it allows him to cancel the debt immediately.

"diablo4","t5_2rzx9","Hi! It looks like you have made a thread about a General Question. In case it is a limited-scope question that may only require short or simple responses, please consider to instead post it in the most recent [Weekly FAQ Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20FAQ%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).  

Questions about [SEASONS](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/14fzvlj/psa_faq_seasons_seasonal_and_nonseasonal/), Crossplay between PC and Console, the Battle Pass or Monetization, are preferably also posted there, as the FAQ might already have an answer to your question.  

This helps to keep the subreddit and people's reddit feeds more readable and overseeable. It also makes it easier for the community to respond to such questions, which increases the chances that you get a fitting response to your specific issue.  

Questions / Requests for Help about Issues with Hardware, System Requirements, Controllers / Keyboard / Input, Monitor / Screen / Widescreen, Visuals, Lag, Connection, Login, Errors, etc, can also fit in the most recent [Weekly Technical Help Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/search?q=flair_name%3A%22Weekly%20Technical%20Help%22&restrict_sr=1&sort=new).

Dont question why i keep mentioning the 3 djinns when thats what this entire reply chain was about to begin with. If you want to rehash the story word for word with no ounce of care put into why its like that, make your own post. But im not going to entertain an argument with someone who thinks theyre smart because they understand the conflict of a story made easy to digest for the 13 year old boys it caters to in the shonen boys magazine it was printed in. 

You act like magi is a non-fiction book and like its plot points are unchangeable facts, and not a fantasy story in some womens head. You act like its gospel and not a flawed story made by someone who was overworked and on a deadline. You act like anyone who doesnt wax poetic about the story is offending you personally, and you cant even hold yourself back from getting angry about it and attacking others. Im willing to bet you’re literally refreshing your browser several times for my reply with how quickly you keep responding to me. 

Its shameful how little reading comprehension you have, but how bloated your ego is that you still feel the need to start arguments to prove to yourself that you know more than others. When in fact, your knowledge of the story you choose to obsess over is surface level at best, and you wouldnt know a theme or metaphor if it was beat over your head by your 3rd grade literature teacher. How can you call yourself an enthusiast when you cant appreciate a work for its flaws and all? You can only inflate it in your head to be the best thing ever and close your eyes and ears to all critiques and completely stop consuming other media.

"Addictedtotheneedle","t5_1yie53","Before I started shooting up I always thought it was so annoying when people tried to talk me out of it and would just say like “don’t even start you’ll ruin your life and regret it!”, I did not believe them. So I switched from snorting to shooting a few months ago. Yeah, umm, they were right. This is so much more addicting I can’t even describe it. I’ve only been injecting for like 3 months but I’ve already spent multiple nights crying on the bathroom floor shaking as I tried to prepare a shot of ONLY WATER because I couldn’t get anything and I NEEDED to see my blood register and shoot ANYTHING into my veins. Btw, I already have really no good spots left. At first it was easy now it’s a fkn chore to even register and get it pushed the whole way in without missing and having ti re-register it because my veins already suck. If you haven’t really started and got dependent on this, I swear to you I’m only telling the truth- you do NOT want this. I’ve had cotton fever from rinsing old cottons, swollen/red/painful spots from partial misses. But yeah I guess the worst part tbh is psychological…. like I feel like I honestly can’t live without this. It’s the strongest pull I’ve ever felt from an addiction. At this point, the drugs don’t even make me high. I usually get a rush for a few seconds and if I do a huge one maybe a lil nod. But then nothing. I really think I’m mostly addicted to the process of it. It’s terrible. Imagine thinking about sticking a needle in your arm 24/7. Yeah. I’m not exaggerating. That’s what it does to us, man. And, I understand and respect if you don’t take my advice cause like I said I didn’t listen either. But I feel like knowing what I know now, I can’t just sit here and be quiet. I don’t have a life anymore. My life IS that needle.",1688169799.0

"AskOldPeople","t5_2yg69","Had something similar happen.  I have an old prof that I've known for ages. Kind of a weird person, so I keep my interactions very infrequent though I check in every once in a while just to make sure they're okay.  There's a very particular song that I equate with this person and I think about them every time I hear it.  One year I wrote all my Xmas cards and thought, ""I wonder if I sold send them a card."" Then I decided against it and didn't think too much about it.  Then I proceeded to hear this very particular non-holiday song three times in a row,  during Xmas season,  so most of the music everywhere was Xmas music.  

I figure the universe is trying to tell me something so I fire off a last minute card. A couple weeks later it comes back saying person has moved.  I didn't think that was true so I sent an email.  Turns out the post office had been returning this person's mail for quite some time and they had no idea.  They got it all straightened around and finally started getting mail again.  A year or so later, I get an email telling me how grateful they were and how that little problem had almost caused so many issues.

"NoStupidQuestions","t5_2w844","Because that wouldn't change anything. First of all, there's no way for a bunch of SWAT guys to correctly identify gang members at a glance. Second, even if you could tell exactly which people were gang members, that doesn't mean you can prove they're criminals in court.

And even then, if you took every gang member in, say, Baltimore, and kicked them all to prison, there would be gang activity again practically overnight. The reason gang activity exists, is because it offers economic opportunities to people living in areas with no economic opportunities. It's been this way going back to the Irish mob and Tammany Hall in the late 1800s.

So if you take out the gang members and leave the poverty, you're gonna have gangs again in no time. It happens across the world like this.",1688169800.0

Wake up, and go spearfishing for fresh snapper in my dive gear. Blue angels are flying over me all day practicing. 

Twice a week I got beer league softball practice and a game, aftwards we go out and try one of the multitude of new restaurants and chic eateries that are popping up with the mass migration happening here..

"SaintMeghanMarkle","t5_481xkf"," I share with you that the victims who wanted to speak directly and denounce them had the right to do so and have been denied by the NDA. Honestly, what you expose bothers me too.  

But I don't think they have been financially compensated in the ""take this money and shut the fuck up"" style. You considers that one of the people abused was not an inferior employee, but was Samantha Cohen, a trusted person of the Queen, and others were Amy Pickerill and Melissa Touabti. Without leaving aside Jason Knauf. Four victims are known who they were and I think there were even witnesses to the matter, I think it was Touabti who was crying on the Australian tour and that Rebecca English saw her and found out that she was crying because Megain was rude. 

 Knauf was even excused from his NDA to expose Megain in court in the letter case. But why didn't the other people, whose identity was known, report them? They could do it even with NDA, because they would not win their case, but they would expose Megain. So, if they didn't, it wasn't for simple financial compensation. Something else was converted inside the Palace. And I think several of them are still working at the Palace.  

I honestly don't think ""taking action"" against Markle would have fixed the problem. Because, and I am speculating totally open to debate: if Megain had been exposed in court for her conduct, what punishment would she have received? Pay the victims. But she wouldn't have paid, because she didn't have the money. In the end, Palacio would have had to pay. And Megain would have even used that court to victimize himself, with ""they have been told to say those bad things about me."" 

  
I have a conflict with exposing Megain and releasing the NDA to the victims, because I don't see that there would be a benefit for the victims in the end, because I think that Megain would still have evaded his responsibility in any way. In fact, part of Megain's reason for going to the USA was precisely that issue. And what is the use of taking her to court if Megain is not a UK citizen? They were not going to deport her for a labor cause. And neither would the end result have been truly liberating for the victims. Otherwise, it is something to see that in the USA Megain's behavior has not changed and neither have his victims denounced them. 

  
What I don't understand, and there I think we will agree completely, is why the RF excused Megain when they saw that she was a rude and disrespectful woman since she was Hazz's girlfriend. There I do not understand why the Queen did not put a stop to it and withdraw the authorization for the wedding, when she herself witnessed how rude Megain was. And I don't understand why the Queen didn't take more forceful action when she found out, from William, that the Harkles were being rude to the staff. Ah yes, I think the Queen failed. It was not a good idea to call Lord Geidt to keep an eye on the Harkles and inform him, because the one who complained about the Harkles was no longer a secretary or a clerk, but William himself. I believe that the Queen erred on excessive prudence or lack of proactivity to have taken measures at that time. And the problem was that Charles and William couldn't take stronger measures without the Queen's permission. There I think there was a big mistake that was beneficial for the Harkles. As Bower said, Megain smells weakness.",1688169801.0

A blush was planted on her face, mostly because of how awkward holding all those cans was. She looked around and found a place to place them, “hey… I’m sorry about that. I just thought it was funny that first week of camp if I already found someone…since like people don’t really have crushes on me and..well it’s funny because… you know, like first week of camp! Met a boyfriend or something. I guess if I have to explain it it’s not that funny.” She bit her lip and then giggled, something she rarely did. This was awkward.

I mean, of course I knew the Beatles from musical education class in school and the songs that I heard ocassionally on the radio. But I only knew a handful of songs like Yellow Submarine, Help or the obligatory Let it be.

But ""1"" just blew me away while listening to the album for the first time. The progression of their sound and the songwriting from the simple but effective ""Love me do"" to the later expiremental songs and at last the sentimental Ballads from Abbey Road and Let it be.

I successively bought all of their records and took a deep dive into their material.

I would estimate some time in the late 19t/early 20th century, where rifles began to possess ranges significantly over just a few hundred metres and rates of fire of once every few seconds.

[A Lee-Enfield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%E2%80%93Enfield) was the standard-issue weapon for British infantrymen in world war 1 if I'm remembering right, and I think based on a bit of research and some half-remembered psychotic rambles from my granddad that it'd punch a big enough hole for the polar bears to drop in less time than it'd take them to close a hundred paces or so. The fact that machineguns were coming into use is another noteworthy advantage.

[The Lebel 86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebel_Model_1886_rifle) is an earlier weapon that has similar bear-killing specs and was produced in 1886. This is around a similar time as the [Maxim machinegun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) which also remained effective long after its creation.

&#x200B;

If these two weapons' widespread utilisation alone isn't enough to make the bears obsolete, then advances in artillery that came shortly after definitely would. I don't see humans proving less effective any later than the 1910s at worst.",1688169802.0

The charging port, however, is fucked. Ive had to use the insurance twice to get a new one which cost a $150 deductable both times. The phone I have had now for about 4 months is already getting wonky with the charge port and I had to have it cleaned recently.

Why?

Because the Reddit Admins have decided that [they want to kill off all 3rd-party apps](https://old.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/), [3rd-party bots, and everything else that makes Reddit barely usable](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/). And, of course, that includes bots such as [\/u\/QualityVote](http://reddit.com/user/QualityVote), [\/u\/SaveVideo](http://reddit.com/user/SaveVideo), [\/u\/AuddBot](http://reddit.com/user/AuddBot), etc.

So you'll just have to put up with automod and a worse overall user experience in the meantime.

^(Can't wait for everywhere to get flooded by spam when the admins finally kill off the moderation bots that we rely on to prevent spambots)

If you have any complaints, direct them at [the reddit admins instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12qwagm/an_update_regarding_reddits_api/), because they're the ones seeking to ruin everyone's user experience.

I need a solution since I'm only going up from here. Any recommendations? Also any idea what I can do to soothe my hand in the meantime? Thank you!

If you are thinking about getting a R6ii, at the refurbished prices, you can currently get a R6 ($1299 - the fact that this is half of what I paid!) and R7 ($1399), that's almost the same as a new R6ii.  Unless video is really that important or you love shooting electronic shutter, the difference between R6/R6ii isn't that big.

"Weddingattireapproval","t5_2h5s92","THANK YOU. I saw the post about the pink dress that had a slightly sheer mid section and I thought the dress was totally fine for a wedding. I feel like the majority of this sub is very conservative or older generations. Wedding attire is evolving because women are evolving!! Obviously no one should be trying to wear something that overtakes the bride (and don’t wear anything white)-but geeze people, if there is a small cut out in a dress it’s not the end of the world and the bride will not care! 

I have only been in this sub for a couple of weeks and I am very disappointed with it. But glad that someone finally said something! 

It’s also dependent on what part of the world people live in and the bride/grooms views. Ex: if it’s at a church, I would say wear something more on the conservative side. But I think it’s about finding a balance- if you want something low cut, it shouldn’t be short too. If you want something with a stomach cutout, it shouldn’t be low cut. If you want a high slit, don’t have a stomach cut out, etc. Picking 1 thing to be more revealing rather than having everything out IMO.",1688169804.0

"carnivorediet","t5_hpayg","what helped me with my last 2 stomach bugs: the first one i fasted for 72 hours and it was gone. 

the second one was a bit more tough as i seem to have gotten food poisoning upon refeeding after a 4 day fast (unlucky lol), so this one took around a week or so more probably. ACV and activated charcoal helped a bit but were not magic bullets. after a week i could start slowly eating. i actually had to refeed with some crackers, plain old white rice and bone broth after 6 months on pure carnivore. it actually went fine and i feel like it was the correct decision even considering the enormous amounts of carbs. my digestive system is kinda alright now, although i still feel a bit of background nausea, ~10 days after. back on meat & fat train woo.

if you dont feel hungry then you should definitely fast, your body’s asking for it. maybe try some home remedies too - plants should be used as a medicine in cases like these IMO. its probably gonna suck for a few more days but I bet you’ll be fine, hope you feel better soon:)",1688169805.0

"CryptoScams","t5_3n82c","I can't speak on behalf of the other legit investigations companies, but I don't think I've ever seen a total cost be that high from us. We have more of a 2 step process. The first is an Initial Analysis, which depends completely on how many TX's we have to track/trace. If we can't find an offramp or entity that can be subpoenaed, that's where we end it. That's typically a few hundred. But if we hit the jackpot and the client chooses to go forward with a Forensic Report to hand over to LE, it'll end up being a few thousand for the work. Again, it all depends on the hours we think it'll take to complete the work. However, the logic still stands in the sense that it's really not ethical to charge a few thousand when you lost under 10k. The model is way more palatable and justified in cost when the victim loses more.",1688169805.0

"Genshin_Impact_Leaks","t5_3l2acu","Tighnari question. KeqingMains poses the concept of using a charged attack before deploying his Burst to add his A1's Elemental Mastery to it. That said, if Polar Star is in hand then this conflicts with using the Burst first to load the 18% ATK into all three of the charged shots. Thus, is it better to miss 18% ATK on one charged shot to get the 50 Elemental Mastery in the Burst, or miss the 50 Elemental Mastery in the Burst to get the 18% ATK into the first charged shot? Neutral values are 1,280 ATK and 337 Elemental Mastery after Dendro Resonance's base 50 addition.

With Polar Star, is it more valuable to add the A1 Elemental Mastery to his Burst, or add the 18% ATK from deploying the Burst to his charged shot? This assumes opening with a normal shot then an uncharged aimed shot before the Skill so that those stacks aren't missing.",1688169806.0

Well, we have the soap box, the ballot box, the jury box, and that other box that will get you reported to admins if you mention it.   

The soap box is where you try talking about it, having a discourse about it.  

The ballot box is where you try to vote to rascals out.

The jury box is where you try to hold people accountable.   

That final box is a bit problematic because most of the stuff that would help a group resist have been made illegal or prohibitively expensive.   Which wouldn't be a problem if they hadn't been selling full-scale military hardware to domestic police departments and trying to amass or manufacture arms that would be required to minimalize casualties would get you either on a watchlist or in jail.   

I'll admit that its a tough nut to crack.   Right now the most cost effective way I've come up with to effect change is to fund scholarships for any aspiring physicist that wants to work on generating a false vacuum decay.   For the uninformed, a false vacuum decay is where you cause a fundamental change in the weak nuclear force that would create a new spatial bubble that would expand outward at the speed of light, effectively exchanging one universe for another.   Being at the point where blowing up the entire universe is cheaper and easier than effecting societal change isn't where we want to be, yet here we are.",1688169807.0

"Jewish","t5_2qtts","I think reddit is not the best way to litmus test the feelings of the world oflr political movements. Theres all sorts of isolated and concentrated hostility online like that.

I specifically didn't say israel should allow itself to get hurt. I reject the narrative that leveling buildings, which has happened recently enough, and armed raids stop hamas in any meaningful way long-term. The teens watching you bomb their buildings and drive down their streets will pick up whatever mantle your target has left to them. We make martyrs and enforce the dovide constantly. 

We dont have to beat people in Al aqsa to prevent lethal hamas attacks. We dont have to fuck up a funeral because of people flouting flag laws to stop hamas. Using explosive ordinances and air strikes in populated areas will never be previse enough. A single innocent killed trying to go after our enemies is a tragedy we should do everything to avoid. 

If leftist opinions are the only thing keeping one from going far right, then they were always far right. Ones political identity should not be formed in reaction to another. It should be instrinsically constructed, scrutinized, and defended. If Israel is forming national policy in reaction to what edgy political theorists on reddit say we are all in trouble.

I would rather no Israel than a fascist theocracy called Israel. (Which is what the far right want, not what Israel is today or has been).

More important than sympathy garnered is actual progress towards peace. A far right israel embracing violent solutions only leads to genocide of palestinians or endless conflict and either of those is a worse tragedy for the Jewish people than the Shoah.",1688169807.0

"GenX","t5_2qur9","Please please please everyone be aware that if you become disabled by long Covid or whatever, immediately apply to have your federal student loans forgiven. Even if you haven’t receive disability because that takes forever I believe your doctor can still complete the form. They don’t even follow your income anymore like they did when they forgave mine.  

It used to be that you had to report your income every year for three years and if you earned above the poverty line I believe it was the balances would come back but after three years they completely went away they show as paid in full on my credit report. 

It was actually really good for my credit score because the if I remember right the underlying loans showed paid and closed because they transferred from the original lender to the Department of Education and then they were on hold for a bit, then they showed paid and closed. So I have all these paid in full credit lines with perfect payment histories. They’re all old now and will fall off soon, but it doesn’t even hurt your credit report. It makes it look like you had a bunch of credit that you’ve paid off. 

I believe Biden changed it so they don’t even follow your income anymore, and I also believe that it’s easier to apply now but I don’t remember the details.

Seriously, and the substantial gainful activity amount to apply for Social Security disability right now is $1470, meaning if you have a disabling condition and you do not earn $1470 a month you can qualify for disability. And then your student loans can be forgiven. And nobody says you have to be disabled forever, you can choose to go back to work and give up your benefits later if you get better. Don’t be afraid to do it it’s easy Peezy to get the student loans forgiven, getting disability, not so much. It took me three years before I started getting money after becoming disabled.

(this is not legal advice and when I say disability I mean SSDI, if you have not worked enough to qualify for SSDI, if you have assets and money you may not qualify for SSI which is the form of disability that you get if you didn’t work enough. Even if you don’t qualify for SSI because of assets you should still be able to get your loans forgiven)",1688169808.0

"unrealengine","t5_2x11n","I've solved my own problem and in my research I saw many with the same unanswered question so Ill put it here.

I was partly wrong and partly right in a way. I managed to get a custom linear .EXR file to work well with my custom mesh. So in all reality it is just a linear black to white texture you need with 32bit information atleast. However, Epic kinda cheated when they made theirs, or atleast I still cant figure out how they did it. Their file is .HDR which allows 32 bit or more information. However if you upload a .HDR it can only be imported as a Texture Cubemap like as HDRIs are normally used for and Texture Cubemap cannot be used like a normal texture. So I assume they have some behind the scenes code or something they used to allow their asset to be a HDR texture without being a cubemap, thats atleast as far I could find. I found no way or option to convert an .HDR to a regular texture. 

So In short if someone is recreating the eye material with their own assets like me all you need to do is make your own copies of the texture maps with the most important being 32bit .EXR for the displacement map. Aswell the Normal map that is used at the beginning of the material I used a baked world space normal from substance painter. Otherwise just loosely copy the rest of the Asset with the UV map being the most important part.",1688169809.0

They got rid of the ""racoon"" suit (except for the one time they brought it back for no reason)

In 3D Land and 3D World, the super leaf turns you into Tanooki Mario. Then in the Special Worlds you got the Silver Leaf (Lucky Bell in 3D World) in which Tanooki Mario wears a bandana for the version that turns into stone. 

In 3D World they gave the turning to stone ability to the Lucky Cat Suit where the visual difference is that he wears a bell collar.

I suppose the only actual reason for the Racoon suit existing is because the game was in 8Bit and they couldn't display the difference between the 2 versions outside of Mario only having ears and the tail for the inferior one.",1688169809.0

>This is one of those common criticisms that Internet people have thrown at the Jedi/Republic because they heard a youtuber say it, causing the myth to spread. It's utterly fake, but is also more than a little bit hilarious -

The child soldier thing comes from the Republic Commando novels from the pre-Clone Wars cartoon canon. One of the Jedi characters, Etain, struggles with how the clones appear in the force. There's a childlike element to them that adds to the ethical quandary that the books spend their time exploring. It's not from some YouTuber, it's not something made up - it was a major question from a popular series of books that ended up being quite influential, even if they eventually became legends.",1688169810.0
