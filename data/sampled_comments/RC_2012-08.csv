"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","*Worst* kid story? Ok. I grew up in a neighborhood with what seemed like 30 other children + or - 4 years of age from myself. Probably closer to 10-15 total. It was awesome. The older kids had all the cool toys and the younger ones had their adventures. There were no cliques or groups. Well all had a genuinely fun time.


Christmas time was the best because each household got to showcase their latest and greatest toys. I for one, was showing off my brand new Nerf Bow and Arrow. I live in the south, it doesnt really get cold in the winter so we are all playing outside. Everyone. We have big wheels racing around, power wheels scootin along the sidewalk. Footballs and soccer nets. Baseballs and a new basketball hoop. It just seemed so lively. 


But me. Me with my Nerf Bow and Arrow would hunt my sisters down. I'd fire an arrow, hit them pick it up and run away. One of them eventually got fed up and threw a rock she had gotten from our walkway in my direction. I took cover behind a tree, but I was relentless. I fired another arrow, and another. It seemed like I had an endless supply of arrows! But... they had more rocks. And my sisters, being among the older kids in the neighborhood encouraged the others to join them. So in a matter of minutes, I was firing arrows blindly into a barrage of rocks from behind a tree. They would whiz past my head every time I poked out for a shot. I was trapped. There were 7-9 kids throwing rocks at me.


Finally my sister calls a seize fire, casually walks up to the tree... and bunkers me. She hit me with a rock in the stomach and boy was I mad. I wanted to tackle her and spit on her face so I chased her. I chased her in a big circle. Across the street into my neighbors yard, caddy-corner, our neighbors yard and was coming back to my house.... where the kids awaited each with a rock. 


I got stoned. So much so that I had to get 7 stitches on my left eyebrow, not to mention the other cuts and bruises that resulted from getting pelted with rocks. As soon as I let out that wail, all the kids fled. I didnt know how bad it was until I looked in the mirror on the way to the hospital. Blood running all down my face. They had to give me a sedative just to put the stitches in. I still am terrified of rocks.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;So, a woman born without ovaries then should not be considered a woman

Not exactly, she was born as female. Gender doesn't come solely from the reproductive organs present, that was just a point of affairs where i would reconsider this. It's not hard at all to deal with malformations etc.

&gt;Also, that calls for a third gender/sex category for official forms, at the very least.

No, you are the gender you are born with(Hermaphrodite being the exception for obvious reasons). To consider law-wise a change in gender is worthless until you can reproduce like someone on that gender. For that should be the only distinction the law makes(you know pregnancy and all..), that i can think of.

&gt;So, the dictionary trumps all other forms of understanding?

I have not said this, i suggested you did visit the dictionary, no more, no less. Although language-wise the dictionary is the authority for definitions, so... in order to properly speak it is advisable you keep to dictionary definitions.(assuming information is the point, that is, excluding poetry and others that gain from playing with words)

&gt;What about if I find a scientific definition that disagrees with the dictionary?

The dictionary isn't static, words change for stuff like this.

&gt;Should I still treat the dictionary as the exclusive arbiter of what the parameters of social categories are?

That's as irrelevant a question as it gets, i have not demanded this nor implied it is so. No, you shouldn't.

I don't know how you get to the dictionary is the sole arbiter part, this ""For more on this i suggest"" should have let it clear that it is only a good source of info. It all sounds just like rhetoric, instead of arguing the real point which is there's no reason the law should recognize them as females besides them wanting it. Same way i won't, because there's no reason to do so.

&gt;I'm reading this argument as 'the government shouldn't respect your identity'

So you are reading it however you like instead of how it is stated? &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

Do not confuse your identity, with what you want your identity to be. Else i'll want to be God on my id. Because i 'feel' like one. It is ridiculous to acknowledge this sort of 'sex change', as an actual sex change, it's peoples bodies and their fancies, and i'm fine with that, but putting it in the law is completely pointless.

I could agree to having a 'transgender female' on their id, for easy identification(by police and so on), but that's all. No actual sex change is going on. And legally speaking they should still be treated as their gender.","1343779205"

"ireland","t5_2qhb9","Like legalising (at least medically) cannabis: sure, it's not the number one pressing concern of our times. Stoners want to have their fun legally? Who cares? Right? Let's focus on employment, education, lowering the crime stats and an end to all forms of institutional and political corruption. Right? 

No.

I pick this example because I think most redditors are aware or what a waste of time and resources the whole prohibition of cannabis thing is; it permeates into everything and a change in it's status could change everything. At least a little bit. For the better. Not just on the level of common sense economics, and all that correlates to, but that it poisons the minds of the populace against this largely benign form of intoxication. 

Now, oppositewise, keeping some animal in cruel conditions for it's eggs or fur or whatever is legal and so the populace continues on it's unemphatic, uncaring, thoughtless trajectory about such issues. 

Being cruel can be fun for some and is, perhaps, necessary sometimes (debatable), but... Fur? Really?  Should it be a commonly accepted and legislatively condoned practice?  

C'mon! Fur? Right now, we really, really don't need it in this part of the world. Let the peoples in and around the arctic circle take what they need on that score. But for anyone else it's either mindless, vacuous vanity or a very sick and twisted sense of comportment.

It may not seem like THE most important issue but it fucking permeates. It's part of a tapestry of ideas that trickle into everything. Don't divorce yourselves from what you know is right because you're afraid of seeming too PC (sharp intake of breath)... I mean... carry on, nothing to see here. What? Nobody said PC...

The sole reason I don't feed my own dog raw is that he requires a low-protein diet due to kidney problems and is small, so it simply wouldn't be practical to purchase/use the tiny amounts of meat he'd need before it went bad.

"cars","t5_2qhl2","i would say one of the culprits to you being kind of brushed aside, is that you have a 4 almost 5 yr old car, with 105k miles on it. 20k miles a year is pretty high. most coverage ends at 100k miles, i would check to see if yours has run out. i would be willing to bed they're thinking *YOU* are the reason the car is having so many problems. i work at a buick dealership myself, in the repairs / detailing area. i havent heard of an Enclave having this much trouble, so im not gonna lie, it was my first thought as well. You may have just had the skunk of the run for that day :(

the cost of the radio replacement sounds high, but i wanna mention a few things. 80% of the features you listed, is thru that unit itself. there is an antenna, a camera on the back, and the speakers. the rest is the unit itself. you could buy an aftermarket radio for cheaper, but unless you want to install it yourself (honestly, is fairly easy, esp if you use Crutchfield), it'll cost 100-300 to have it installed properly, depending on where you go. This link is a generic search for Navi units that fit in your car, thru Crutchfield.
http://www.crutchfield.com/g_300/Car-Receivers.html?tp=5684&amp;nvpair=AG_Type%7cYCNavigation
the cheapest one is $600. im not even sure that will even use your reverse camera, either.  so looking at all of that, it doesnt sound so bad. you would get the one that is designed specifically for your car. Personally, i would just go that route, or just upgrade the whole system (unit/speakers/sub). sounds like you are in the vehicle a lot, so a fresh more crisp system would definately get its money's worth in usage.

you can also go into the dealership, ignore the sales people, and go to the parts area directly. you can ask the person at the counter if they can order new units, or refurbished only. if it's a refurbished unit, i would pass. if it's a new unit, i say get it.

ALSO keep in mind, since you are probably out of your warranty now, the salesmen are wanting you to trade it in for the 2012 model. while they may not be pushing that notion directly at you, its is most definitely their state of mind.

EDIT: i just read this, and i noticed i sort of imply how you are being treated is justified, im sorry, it most definately isnt. it shouldnt matter if you are buying a brand new car, or just getting repairs, you shouldnt be getting this sort of runaround. perhaps you should look around for the next dealership that is within a reasonable travel distance. they may give you the same answers as the local place, but at least you wont be getting this cold shoulder attitude it sounds like they are giving you.

The American public is so indoctrinated that whenever anybody goes against the mainstream core values of this country for the purpose of analyzing and improving, people shut down and won't talk because they don't have the facts and don't want to admit they've been duped. We've all been scammed, myself included, and that's okay... only if we have the strength to acknowledge our shortcomings and work to improve.

I walk in and my dog takes off towards the other side of the office (she normally goes right to my office) so I follow her. I don't see anyone and then she starts running to the conference room.

I look over to see my coworker very freaked out and started to walk over (thought he was stealing something) walked in on his wife half naked trying to get dressed as fast as she can. I turned around and tried to walk away quickly telling my dog to follow me. She wouldn't but I kept walking and calling her. She finally came running after me and they left as fast as they could.

This is the essence of my post. I don't see how it's not relevant.

Nobody is talking about ""creating a favorable class."" I have absolutely no idea where you're getting that from. We are talking about what the law should be. If the law were changed to conform to what HarryWaters is suggesting, then a father would be able to marry his 18-year-old daughter.

I'm not sure how to make this any clearer. It's possible that you're just referring to a different post than I am.

Hey, I'm not the one who invoked the ""natural order"".

&gt;Since two men or two women are not ordered by God to be capable of full natural unity through sexual relations

Explain? The sentence just doesn't make much sense. I'm getting the impression from the following sentence as well that ""order"" and ""unity"" have special biblical definitions here, especially since all biological evidence indicates unity (in any typical sense) is indeed possible with homosexual relationships.

So it would appear that you're taking the option of using the literal text of the bible as substantiation- my question then wouldn't concern infertile couples as it would concern *any* sexual act between married couples which wasn't initiated with the intent to procreate. By your definition, having sex with one's partner outside of the monthly cycle of fertility would be sinful, unless both partners were completely unaware of the timing of said cycle.

Your argument that preventing same sex marriages saves people from spiritual harm is fallacious- you seem to accept that homosexuality itself is a natural state, so why do you think that a homosexual in a heterosexual marriage would be any more likely to *want* to procreate with his or her ill-fitting partner? The sex in such a relationship would essentially be serving the purpose of conformity, not procreation, and would therefore be equally sinful. Not to mention that, again, I have yet to see any evidence that marriage facilitates sex. I know that it ostensibly facilitates sex *for Catholics*, but I encourage you to take other ideologies into consideration when pondering nation-or-worldwide principles like this.

&gt;A problem with your three cases is that none of them consider the moral imperative of helping others to achieve salvation.

Actually, I believe that would fall under the second case- ""literal interpretation of scripture"". In which case you're doing a rather poor job picking that one passage to make a fuss over, while doubtless violating countless others yourself.

&gt;Turning the other cheek would probably be a good option here.

This brings me to a point that has always bothered me: if you are so discontented by the sexual attitude of society, then maybe you shouldn't allow society to teach your children sexual attitudes. Be open and frank with your children about sex from a young age. Teach them the many benefits of having a ""Christian"" point of view about sex and sexuality. Remind them often to respect their body as a wonderful gift from God and teach them that it is a thing of beauty, not to be ashamed of, as well.

She literally thought we go to the shops and purchase our groceries and say to the clerk ""Thanks cunt!"".
A lot of people abroad don't realise cunt is still highly offensive in Australia (unless you're some mega huge bogan). Some of us might say it to our mates (I say it very rarely).

Our American brethren are unfortunately very un-worldly, and Reddit is one of the avenues where we can actually break stereotypes and show how we actually are. But nope, we carry the dumb stereotypes by going around saying ""Fuckin' straya cunt!"" and some don't even understand this as a joke.

tl;dr the whole ""cunt"" thing doesn't do us any help and makes us look silly","1343779219"

2. If you could promote one thing that someone else completely unaffiliated with you is doing right now what would it be?

4. What are your top costs that caused the recent forced downsizing of some of your minor shows like This Week in Science?  Should you regain footing would you consider bringing them back?

5. All preferences and ideal situations aside, what devices and programs do you use on a daily basis?

6. All hypotheticals aside, what devices do you recommend on a daily basis more than others and for what reasons?

7. What went through your head when your mother was your first caller on Call for Help?

With the exception of some well established and important federal ones that have come over the years. (I don't have a problem with the civil rights act, etc.) But the state ones would probably be subject to influence and bought just like the current federal ones. Corporations couldn't hide behind departments and regulations that they've influenced and bought and paid for. Example, if they are poisoning the local water supply they are subject to criminal penalties associated with basic human and property rights and would go to jail. (Same way if I came over and poisoned your water). Rather than pay a fine or a slap on the wrist from the EPA.

&gt;no worker rights and no guarantee of equality under the law

Where you get this idea blows my mind. Libertarians believe unions have the right to organize and they could and would (especially if the people running companies are so terrible as you believe). The bill of rights and constitution guarantees our basic set of rights. How would there be no equality under the law? That's an outrageous comment. Please explain.


You know I use to be a very liberal guy(could argue I still am), was a registered democrat and voted for Obama in 08. After constant disappointments with him and listening to Ron Paul in the debates I've done alot of reading and research on libertarianism and to me personally it makes sense, has the best parts of both parties combined, and is just something different. I would ask that you take a little time to do your own reading (browsing /r/libertarian would be a great start) and come to your own opinions and conclusions. And unlike what this link and hardcore progressives will tell you, their philosophy is far from hostile towards yours. Progressives and libertarians both see the same problems, they just offer different solutions. If we could at least start working together on the shit we agree with (ending war and prohibition) and stop demonizing each other we can get some work done.

Nice group of people, and a wonderful community. I know several people still in it. If you ever feel lonely or wanting things to do they would probably welcome you to join in. I am super duper glad I did themed housing. It made my college experience so much better, and I felt my hall was super close. I made so many life long friends there. I really recommend going up there to check things out every now and then. I think that is the 4th floor. So the rooms are pretty tiny though. You will also want box fans (2). Maybe even a smaller room fan too. As for the noise. It depends on your neighbors. The hall really doesn't have much to do with it unless you are in specific (themed) housing or one of the really nice dorms. Most likely you'll be able to get sleep as long as you aren't the world's lightest sleeper. If people are too loud after midnight (that's a reasonable time on week nights, but not weekends. Weekends I'd say 2 am) then maybe ask them to be a little more quiet or ask an RA on duty for help. But nobody likes a party-pooper either, so don't be a jerk about either. Your RA will have a sign outside their door saying who the RA on duty is and where you can find them. You may have to knock on their door, but it is their job to help you. Dorm living is different for everyone. Just use common sense. You can't really change too much about your circumstances now, so it is best not to worry yourself to death. 

In addition, Newman has a pretty good location. You will be outside Hokie Grill, Owens, the library, Squires, War Memorial Gym, and the Graduate Life Center. The new dining hall is across the drill field on that general side of campus behind west end, so you are closer to it than many other dorms are other than the corps cadets' dorms. It does suck if you have classes in Litton reeves or want to go to McComas. But hey this is VT and our campus is huge so get used to walking and enjoy the beautiful scenery that only Blacksburg has to offer.

It didn't last long. Honestly, 10 years later, all I can remember of it is that we held hands at the lunch table (which was supposedly illegal in the lunch-aids' eyes) and our version of breaking up was forgetting that we were together over the summer. Literally. We both forgot.

I felt like a cool kid, having a pretty girlfriend. It really wasn't necessary, and I don't think anyone really cared too much.

I don't remember how it came to be though, really I don't. It was 6th grade!!

Go to [RealTraps](http://www.realtraps.com/index.htm) to see the type of thing we are talking about. There is a lot of good information on that site if you dig a bit. If you don't want to go this route though you can still get good sound.

NHT is a well known brand in the audiophile community. They make great speakers. That said you have a lot of good options in your price range. The best thing that you could do would be to go out to local hi-fi dealers and listen to speakers in person. People have differing tastes in what sounds good to them. There is no guarantee that you will like what others like.

If auditioning in person isn't an option for you than I would look at ordering from an internet direct company that offers an in home trial period. NHT does offer a 30 day in home trial and they even pay return shipping so you are good there. However, since you focus is on music I would take a step up to the NHT Classic series. You can get a 5.0 system with the Classic Fours as your mains for about $3100. The Fours have built in subs so living in an apartment I wouldn't even and a sub to the system.

Other internet direct manufacturers that are worth a consideration:

[Ascend Acoustics](http://www.ascendacoustics.com/pages/products/speakers/SRM1/srm1.html) - A 5.0 of their Sierra bookshelf speakers would run about $2050 but you would need to get stands for the mains at least.

[Salk Sound](http://www.salksound.com/songseries%20speakers.htm) - 5.0 of thier Song series would run about $3200

[Swan HiVi](http://www.swanspeaker.com/product/htm/view.asp?id=249) - Not actually an internet direct company, but you can get a 30 day home trial through [audioadvisor](http://www.theaudioinsider.com/product_info.php?p=swan-diva-6-2-floorstanding-loudspeaker&amp;products_id=29&amp;) who is an authorized dealer. You could get a 5.0 with the Diva 6.2f as mains for $2160.

This all still leaves a fair bit in the budget for the receiver. If it were me I would probably get an [Emotiva](http://emotiva.com/) pre/pro and amp, which should run around $1300.","1343779225"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","I currently swim with the Blue Dolphins and here's my take.
(+) Friendly, nice group of people.
(+) Large range of abilities. There are people learning the basic strokes, to former college people.
(+) Varied workouts. Usually: Mon IM, Wed Distance, Friday Sprints. Fastest lane is doing 3,000-3,800/hour.
(+) Convient practice times/locations (M,W,F) 6-7AM, 7-8AM, Tues PM @ UIC, Sunday AM @ UIC.

(-) We just lost our pool contract for weekday AM at Moody Bible Institute and the coach doesn't have a new one lined up at this time.
(-) Coach Fitz spends more time at the swim studio (most likely where he makes his money) then at the practices. Normally there are 2 college-age people at practice. They are friendly and will gladly help you with technique if you ask. I've read the Yelp reviews for Blue Dolphins and there are a few really negative one because people didn't ask for help. I've vastly improved my flip turns, backstroke, and breast (weakest) because I specifically asked for help.

Recommended? Yes, but there might be a big change coming up at the end of August when we no longer have a slot at the Moody Bible Institute pool for M-F 6-8AM practice.","1343779229"

Depending on your interpretation of karma and rebirth, you'll have different views of suicide and euthanasia. I'd also like to point out that death does not lead to peace and enlightenment. These are experiences and, in your view, death is the absence of experiences. 
 
But mainly I'd like to say that there are other ways out of depression that you probably haven't tried. For example, Ketamine has been shown to instantly cure depression in some cases.

Same-sex parenting:

Gay and lesbian parents are consistently shown by research to be as capable as heterosexual parents.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_parenting (the wiki article cites seven mostly academic sources so you can copy those)

Homophobia and mental health:

30-40% of gay, lesbian, and bisexual youth under 21 years old have attempted suicide. This represents about a threefold increase in suicide attempts when you restrict to sexual orientation minorities.
http://www.sprc.org/sites/sprc.org/files/library/SPRC_LGBT_Youth.pdf

About 20% of LGBT youth in the USA are homeless.
http://www.nationalhomeless.org/factsheets/lgbtq.html

The 20% number is likely a low estimate, since pressure is always AGAINST outing yourself. Some studies report numbers as high as 40% for LGBT homelesness. LGBT people comprise between 30 and 43 percent of clients served by homelessness outreach programs. This is awful, but not all that surprising, given the abundance of stories of LGBT youth being kicked out of their homes after coming out.
http://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/Durso-Gates-LGBT-Homeless-Youth-Survey-July-2012.pdf

(When you compound LGBT and homelessness, you get even HIGHER rates of suicide attempts, up to 53%)
http://www.jahonline.org/article/0197-0070(91)90080-6/abstract

In states that passed amendments banning same-sex marriage, rates of psychiatric disorders among LGBT individuals increased measurably after the ban. In the case of generalized anxiety disorder, the increase was about 250%.

Conversion therapy:

Conversion therapies have been determined to be ineffective and to pose a harm to the health and even life of their victims.
http://new.paho.org/hq/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6803&amp;Itemid=1926

Recently the president of a leading Ex-gay organization, Exodus International, revoked his opinions on reparative therapy, saying in no uncertain terms that there is no cure for homosexuality, that the promise of such (as typified by Exodus International's slogan ""change is possible"") gives false hope, and that such therapies can even be harmful.

"microbiology","t5_2qirk","When I swapped jobs almost 2yrs ago, my starting salary was about $90k. It is really hard to answer your question because the starting number will vary depending upon where you live in the US. There are some good websites out there like glassdoor.com that show what people's salaries are in certain job descriptions. It also really depends upon the company (e.g. start-up vs. medium-sized company vs. established big pharma company). In general I'd say probably anywhere from $70k+ - although it could be less if it is hospital oriented or academia. Also, if you were planning on doing a post-doc, that won't be much more than 30-40k/yr I think... but don't quote me on that. I really don't know since I won't be doing one. Hope that helps!

&gt;So from just the 2 racks of bodies I can see, i count 5 rows and in each column 7 deep. So that's 35 bodies on each shelf, I see 6 shelves visible, so that's 210 bodies per entire rack. Clearly at least 2 racks, so 2 racks we get a minimum of 420 bodies. That's not even factoring there is more then 2 racks, since we only see 2. So at retail price estimate at $6,800 (each) x420 bodies that's $2,856,000.00 just in bodies! WOW!!!

&gt;I don't even know where to begin with the lenses, too many variables and unseen shelves/racks. Anyone want to guess the total retail value of that room? Given the low estimate $2.9M in bodies, I'd say at least $9-11M USD!!!","1343779252"

I was late to the Six Feet Under party, so I never did get to read much viewer commentary.  That said, what you mentioned doesn't surprise me in the least.  Brenda WAS written to be a supremely complex character.  If a viewer is not able to appreciate Brenda as she is between-the-lines, mental health and all, they deem her the ""batshit feeemale,"" which is this really nebulous, lazy notion I see bandied around far too often when a woman shows any kind of complexity in character (they do with Lori in TWD, also).

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; ... should be about discussing the topic not discrediting others work.

If the work has no scientific backing, then it is fine to discredit someone's theory. This goes back to our fundamental difference discussed elsewhere: there is a _[very specific definition of the scientific method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method)_, and failing to meet that standard, what that video discusses isn't science.

You seem to think that ""all viewpoints should be discussed,"" but in science, the viewpoints are only as strong as the evidence that supports it. Please, I beg of you, _at least understand this part_.

You gave the example of people thinking the Earth was flat. [Anachroisms aside](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth#Classical_world_2) (that is, that was overturned _fairly early on_), in the absence of evidence to support the claim, a spherical Earth _shouldn't_ be taken seriously. However, as stated in my link, there is plenty of evidence in the form of seafaring observations to counter the flat earth belief.

&gt; I am just so tired of the know it all attitude in here.

I think you only see that because you adopt the ""science doesn't know everything"" attitude - and you are right! Everything _isn't_ known. **However**, it doesn't mean any random and baseless speculation or hypothesis should be addressed. _It shouldn't_. If there is a significant enough controversy or uncertainty, you will see that stated.

The requirement for evidence is what separates science from philosophy.","1343779265"

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","There have been comparisons of household income vs household expenditures but they suffer from the same problem as household income, its nearly impossible to account for changes in demographics (falling household size), changes in income profiles (more women are working, women earn less) and the three changes in the way we calculate CPI since 1970.

While personal income is not subject to many of these problems comparing it to a rise in costs is subject to the problem that most living expenses are incurred at the household level not the personal level, how do you account for this?

One ""back door"" way to look at this problem though is via [RECS](http://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/). RECS looks at what devices households own based on various types of demographics, including household income. While we can't use this for a direct comparison its useful for understanding how people are doing, people generally don't buy a new tv if they can't afford food, and the trends from this gives an indication of if the amount of true disposable spending power, after basic living expenses, is increasing or decreasing. The two dips in the last 30 years are 90-92 and 07-10 but otherwise all indicators are trending up for all income groups. While we can't use this to definitively state that people ""have more money"" then they did previously it does show that the purchasing power of those people has increased.","1343779268"

While I appreciate the Rush entries... I'd honestly have been fine with them just putting ""Hemispheres"" on the list and making room for such influential, important albums as ""Hot Rats"" by Frank Zappa, ""Tarkus"" by Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer... they should have limited it to one really important album per band, and made room for other acts like the above, plus later ones who kept the genre evolving like Marillion and Porcupine Tree.

It's just a shame that a Top 10 list for such a diverse genre is populated by a bunch of albums by the same few bands, some of whom don't even deserve it.  These are all great albums, but...

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","The Catholic Church doesn't ""support"" a metaphorical interpretation of Genesis; it does allow members to make their own judgement as to whether Genesis 1 is a literal, 6-day telling of the story of creation, or whether it tells a story of what really happened using symbolic language. In other words, the Church has no official position on Young Earth Creationism vs. Old Earth Creationism / Theistic Evolution.

However, the Catholic Church has made it a matter of official Church teaching that Adam and Eve were two, real, unique human beings, and that every human is descended from them. Otherwise, the doctrine of original sin would make no sense. (Pope Pius XII, Humanii Generis)","1343779274"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","When someone sees me coming up behind them at a restaurant or store, and just lets the door shut in my face. I was raised to hold the door open. My dad taught me that if someone is within 10 steps of the door, go ahead and hold it for them. If it's iffy, hold it anyway. Always be that guy, because if someone's having a bad day, a stranger showing the smallest consideration can be the thing that turns the day back around for them. And if *you're* having a bad day, knowing that you did something to make a stranger's day .001% better could have the same effect.

When someone sees me and just lets the door shut, and I have to catch it to avoid getting hit by it, I don't know.. it feels akin to being spat on. Kind of like, ""I know you're there, but fuck you.""

It's probably irrational, but it really gets to me.","1343779275"

That being said, for this to work you need a way to manipulate -other- users cart accounts. This can be accomplished by: Man in the middle attack if the original merchant does not use SSL or XSS injection vulnerability on the same page as the checkout is happening on.

Something else that I'd like to see would be a kind of metaphysics for the Dresdenverse, kind of like what you're putting out here. Could it be that the Fae and Dragons (and possibly even God) are more than just forces of nature, but that they're anthropomorphized because they were created by the belief of humanity? It would match up well with the Fae ""sealing their power"" from the actions of the Brothers Grimm, and the existence of the Oblivion War.

So where was i?

This is part of the sacred trusts in the sultans palace, or Topkapı Palace, in Istanbul. I've seen this myself. It's mostly bullshit. Allow me to explain.

This is a collection of Mohamed's personal effects, or sacred trusts, that the Turks looted from the Arab world after they assumed the Caliphate. In this part of the palace are gutters from the Kaba, locks from the Kaba, cloth from the Kaba, etc etc. I recall that room VIVIDLY. Slight racist moment, but you could smell that room before you saw it. There were so many arabs/muslims elbowing each other to get into that hot, hot, room that it was basically a B.O. incubator. There are armed police, with machine guns in each room keeping the mob of devotees in line and pushing them along. I say ""line"" but there is no line, just a mass of worshipers praying and shoving each other to get closer to the glass and see these pieces of their prophet, in the same manner catholics do, but with that irony that only comes from seeing people who will stone you if you draw the prophet because you might worship the picture, groveling and touching the relics of that same prophet.




Below is a list of the artifacts I remember seeing:

* The [Sword of David](http://imgur.com/AtcBU): A surprisingly hard piece of steel for a small impoverished nation state just [coming off the bronze age](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeology_of_Israel#Bronze_Age). 
* The [Staff of Moses](http://imgur.com/0kN8T) (please hold laughter until the end): Well boys and girls, this is it, the staff of moses. Obviously the real thing because it's behind glass! This thing looked to be about 3ft tall.
* Mohamed's Beard: Yup that's right! The beard of the prophet was collected after he shaved it off and distributed it after a pilgrimage, and we all know how much science agrees with the quran, so I'm sure the muslims had it tested.... oh, nevermind.
* [Mohamed's Tooth](http://www.thesacredtrusts.com/):
* Mohamed's cup: The cup is wooden, but someone covered it in silk, so all you could see was the lip of the cup. I learned after the tip the REAL cup is in London. I saw a replica.
* Mohamed's sword, bow, and quiver: They were pretty. As I stood there looking at them all I could think was ""so that's the pen that mohamed drew the boundaries of his empire with.""
* Mohamed's Mantle: Who knows if this is real or not, but there is a lot of silly... WORSHIP of mohamed that can be observed through this. The Ottomans used to kiss it on the 15th day of Ramadan. They even once dipped one button into water and gave drops of that water to favorites, and they all CURE PEOPLE! Magic! This was also CARRIED INTO BATTLE to inspire the sultan's troops to fight harder to spread islam! So peaceful, mashallah. 
* Abu Bakr's Sword: Maybe? The Ottomans ""decorated"" all these swords in gold and jewels so GL to who ever has to verify thier age when the muslims let them get tested for authenticity. 
* Omar's sword: eh.
* Ali's sword: THIS I DOUBT. This was NOT Zulfiqar, as it was not split at the end. yeah I know some say it wasn't, but ex-Shia here so I heard dif stuff than you.
* [Fatima's Dress](http://imgur.com/aVPfI): okay, i kinda doubt it.
* Hussein's ""mantle""/dress: lol.

I also leaened the Ottoman's rebuilt the Kaba! [After a heavy rain and flood in 1621 and further in 1629 the walls of Kaaba fell down and the Masjid was damaged.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram#Ottomans) That's right the HOUSE OF ALLAH, built by adam (who didnt share his building techniques with the cavemen...) and Abraham, **fell down**.

You can use any kind of meat in this stew. Chicken, ribs, beef chucks, even fish. I like mine with oxtail so I'll go with that.

If you're going to cook oxtail, you need a pressure cooker since it's really tough to cook. Add enough water to cover the meat and cook it until tender (if you need more info on this, let me know and I'll get the specifics).

Once the meat is tender, add carrots, corn, potatoes, cassava/yuca, plantains, salt, pepper, cilantro and any other starch you want. I don't usually add sweet potato since this tends to be more of a savory dish instead of a sweet one, but whatever works. Cook in the pot until the veggies are done and serve with lime and avocado. If you want to get especially Colombian, serve with a banana. I know it sounds weird but it's actually really tasty.

Also, you can either add the cilantro while it cooks or sprinkle some on after you serve it.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I believe that it is a life-changing, eye-opening way to see the real world. As an 18 year old male who has to somehow adapt into this monstrosity of a world, I find it incredibly hard to bear. Reading news reports of how men were put to jail simply because the woman's word was trusted (there was no proof) and how men would have been fined insane amounts. Luckily a few of these men had proof (audio and video recordings, like the taxi driver who told the three teenage girls in his cab to not smoke) but the evidence was cast aside as ""not enough"" to do anything against the women. 
This has led me to constantly think of breaking up with my girlfriend (planning on getting married after we finish university) and I am sometimes unable to sleep at night due to the insane double standards. Not only this, but people laugh at men's genitals getting harmed in movies or other cases, but if 1% of the equal was even mentioned against a woman, the shock would be unbearable for the audience. 
To be completely honest, I have considered suicide around 12 times now, attempting twice. It is very tough to know that one day when I have little children of my own, who I provide for, feed, love, raise, and nurture, will be taken away from me in the blink of an eye because one woman decided that she suddenly did not want me anymore. It is heart-wrenching, disgusting, and very degrading. 
MensRights is truly a necessary medium for public records against men in daily life to be kept.

"travel","t5_2qh41","I don't know what people's love affair with Visa Service's are.  The best and easiest way to get a Visa processed is direct through the consulate.  

I understand that people fret because they don't want to miss any of the finer details and miss out, but it's not rocket science.

My best tip for preparing a Visa application is to look at what the country (China, in this case) tells other countries for the same visa.  The reason I do this is because sometimes things do get lost in translation and formatting.  The way something is explained to a US Citizen, a Canadian Citizen, or a New Zealand Citizen might be different, but all mean the same thing.  Two you might go ""well that makes no sense..."" and one you go ""ah yes, I know what that means!"".  

Comparing [this](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/hzqz/zgqz/t84245.htm) for the USA and [this](http://au.china-embassy.org/eng/ls/t286322.htm) for Aussies for the exact same information is a good reflection of the same.  

For example [if you're an Australian trying to get a Z Visa](http://au.china-embassy.org/eng/ls/t286322.htm)

&gt; **2. How do I apply for a Business Visa (F Visa) if I need to visit China on business?**

&gt; You should provide the following documents: 

&gt; * (1) One completed Visa Application Form with a passport photograph attached; 

&gt; * (2) Your passport with at least 6-month validity and at least 2 blank visa pages; 

&gt; * (3) One of the following documents (original or photocopy): 

&gt; * - a. Invitation letter from the competent office of the Chinese government. 

&gt; * - b. Invitation letter from the host company in China. 

&gt; Please note: 

&gt; (1) Apply for the visa only 1 to 2months before your planned date to enter China. 

&gt; (2) People born in China must provide their names in Chinese characters to column ""1"" of the Visa Application Form. 

&gt; (3) Fill in every column of the Visa Application Form, using ""N/A"" if not applicable. 

&gt; (4) The supporting documents will not be returned once lodged with the application. If necessary, please make copy beforehand. 

&gt; (5) The ""PICK UP FORM"" you get when you lodge the application is the only proof for collection; when lost, only the passport holder himself with proper photo ID can retrieve his passport. 

&gt; (6) Please be aware that no modification will be accepted once the application is lodged. 

&gt; (7) Please pay for the visa on collection (Please refer to Question 11, 12 for the visa fee), and please pay in cash, bank cheque, money order or company cheque. The ""payee"" should be CHINESE EMBASSY. 

&gt; **3. How do I apply for an Employment Visa (Z Visa) if I am going to get employment in China?**

&gt; You should provide the following documents: 

&gt; * (1) One completed Visa Application Form with a passport photograph attached; 

&gt; * (2) Your passport with at least 6-month validity and at least 2 blank visa pages; 

&gt; * (3) Employment Permit (the original one and a photocopy are needed), and ""Visa Notification"" letter (the original one and a photocopy are needed), which are both from the competent office of the Chinese government. 

&gt; Please note: 

&gt; (1) Your employer in China should get the Employment Permit and the ""Visa Notification"" letter for you from the competent office of the Chinese government, and then forward them to you to support your visa application. 

&gt; (2) After presenting to the embassy the original Employment Permit and the ""Visa Notification"" letter, please ask for the return of them and only leave the photocopies to the consul together with the application. The original ones are needed when you go through procedures inside China. 

&gt; (3) The Employment Visa is valid for 3 months. Bearer of the Visa should make the entry into China within this 3-month period, and apply for residence permit in the local Public Security Office within 30 days after arriving China. If need be, the bearer may also apply for a multiple re-entry visa in the same Public Security Office. 

&gt; (4) The ""PICK UP FORM"" you get when you lodge the application is the only proof for collection; when lost, only the passport holder himself with proper photo ID can retrieve his passport. 

&gt; (5) Please pay for the visa on collection (Please refer to Question 11, 12 for the visa fee), and please pay in cash, bank cheque, money order or company cheque. The ""payee"" should be CHINESE EMBASSY.



The instructions are similar (but not the same) for [applying yourself](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/hzqz/zgqz/t84245.htm) as an American wanting the visa.  Why pay someone to do it for you, when the instructions are fairly simple?

I have found that the Chinese consulates around the world are some of the friendliest to deal with.  You can email them, you can ask them questions, and sometimes they'll even help you (I had one girl refuse to accept my form because it wasn't filled out right...she told me what I needed to fill out and where)","1343779300"

"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","You can do this. You *can* do this. In many ways, its the only option you have left. She's told you she isn't interested in sex, and you've seen that you can't force it. It's either this, you learn to accept a sexless lifestyle, or divorce. 

So she's told you to do it but she never wants to hear about it. So you do it, and you maintain the highest level of secrecy possible. Don't think you have permission for an open marriage, instead think of it as classic infidelity. The better you keep the secret, the smoother things will go. 

Never bring it home in any way, shape, or form. Never text, email, or call girlfriends while you are at home. Don't even bother looking at your phone. Never prioritize a girlfriend/sex friend over your family. Remember that sex friends are **friends** and shouldn't be treated as such. You wouldn't give priority to your poker buddies or office co-workers. Same deal.

The other half of the bargain is that in doing this, you let go of any sexual expectations you may have for your wife. Let go of the anger, bitterness, resentment. Redefine your marriage as one in which you are close in every aspect aside from sex. Truly accept it, come to terms with it. And enjoy your wife for everything else she brings to the table.

So, sometime in the middle of the night, I snap awake to the sounds of quiet muttering from a strange female voice. I am scared out of my wits at this point, ready for someone to kill me in the dark, and then just as I am about to accept death, I hear a moan coming from the bed across from mine. Apparently my roommate wanted to hook up one last time before the semester was over, and over the next hour or so they slowly went through foreplay while I was ""sleeping.""

I would love to tell Reddit that I was brave. I would adore giving you some story about me stealing her clothes and making a break for it. It would be fantastic to say I had a threesome. I would not lie to you like that.

Aside from that, given that his batting numbers are exactly the same as Blanco's and Blanco is significantly faster around the bases, Blanco is a more valuable player for the team than Nate's been this year (hence the limited play time for Nate).

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","&gt;I didn't say they magically discharge, I said accidentally. If you're a fan of American Football you'll probably remember when Plaxico Burress shot himself in the leg. Not everyone is as careful as we would like them to be.

What happened with Plaxico was negligence. The weapon discharged because the trigger was pulled. 

It may sound like playing symantics, but it's an important distinction because it's so common to come across reports of ""the gun just went off,"" which is why so many people are terrified by the mere presence of a gun. It also tends to place blame on the weapon rather than the person. 

Plaxico was negligent and held criminally responsible for that negligence. It's also worth noting that he didn't have a valid license to carry the weapon in the night club where the incident occurred.

&gt;It would be a much better place if when that happened people didn't have a gun in their pocket. In fact it's even better to prohibit the guns if the owners are usually law abiding, as they would then be more likely to not bring them in and possibly cause incidents.

I don't understand how this logically follows if people that have a valid license to carry a firearm are statistically *less* likely to commit a violent crime than the population at large. 

Wouldn't we expect them to commit crimes at an equal rate, if not higher, if people are more likely to fly off the handle and act irrationally because they have access to a firearm?","1343779329"

Story mode does jump up to a higher level than you will be if you go right at the recommended level. Just keep doing hearts/looking for DEs, keeping in mind that you can explore other starting areas, maps, and their hearts/DEs as well. 

I was underleveled for the story, seemingly by design since I did the story quests right at recommended level, and so I just kept doing hearts and events in other races' areas. I **only** did hearts/DEs and I had no problem casually cruising around, doing hearts/events when I came upon them, the occasional vista, and leveling up to where I needed to be. There is an obscene amount of exp-content in the game and all it takes is some running around.

"baseball","t5_2qm7u","II've heard people reporting that the prospects the Reds gave up were number 5 and 7 in their system. I don't know where that is coming from, but most Reds fans would agree it isn't accurate.

Joseph is a good lefty bullpen arm who dominated in two levels this year. He made the team out of spring training and got shelled and quickly demoted. He completely fell off the team's radar as far as prospect status goes, but he worked on his mechanics/delivery and is a different pitcher now. He was expendable because most of the Reds pen is signed through next season, Masset may eventually get healthy this year, and Hoover is still ahead of him on the pecking order in AAA.

Sulbaran is an intriguing prospect, but not thhe Reds #5 overall. I would rate him their fifth best SP prospect behind Corcino, Stephenson, Cingrani, and Travieso. He's young for AA, thhough, and he has a good skill set. He was an international signee a couple years ago. He has a live arm but has struggled with control. Realistically, he might be three years out still. Optimistically, he could comme up sometime in 2014.","1343779337"

THC, Cocaine, Amphetamines, Opiates, and Phencyclidine (PCP). 

Although psilocin and its two deamination products are observable, after derivitization, by conventional chromatographic instruments, most laboratories are not set up to perform this analysis. 

Even if laboratories conducted the testing, psilocybin and psilocin are very quickly metabolized and usage through urine or blood testing cannot detect these substances after about 3-7 days. Hair drug tests are not set up to look for them either. 

Obtaining an accurate result is very difficult due to the very small detection window and the fact that the metabolites are very unstable once they are collected and move through the body very quickly.

He had a difficult time getting his sugar under control. If we could get it under 200 we were happy. He would go to low like to 25 or so. He had one seizure on me when it was too low. Keep a syringe filled with honey o molasses so you can rub some on his gums if he is acting lethargic (sleepy) and and if he has a seizure. We lost him this past March at the age of 7 as he had a seizure and a stroke while he was in the vet hospital the last time. He was only 7.

Lots of cats respond very well to diet and insulin and sometimes can get off the insulin. Thor gained wt. rather than losing and he got up to 24 pounds but was down to 19 when he died.

"ottawa","t5_2qpoo","this program is only good for businesses who use most of their hydro during the day, NOT RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS! (for more information, read on..)

With the new smart meters in place, we now pay different rates during different hours of the day. you'll see that you are charged 3 different rates during different times of the day.

Off-Peak 	$0.065/kWh - nights/weekends

Mid-Peak 	$0.100/kWh - evenings

On-Peak     $0.117/kWh - business hours

I'm pretty certain these are the rates. I remember mine being 3&gt;&gt;6&gt;&gt;9cents but whatever.

These guys lock you in at a flat rate of 7 or 8 cents. this is not a good idea for residents, as everyone is usually at work during the day, and usually use more hydro during evenings, nights, and weekends.

Therefore, if you're in a business, SIGN RIGHT UP! you'll see loads of savings, however, residential customers will see their bill effectively double, and cancelling requires you to pay upwards to 1000-2000 dollars.

=

NOW, IF YOU PAY NATURAL GAS, NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO LOCK IN YOUR GAS RATES, CONSIDERING SUPPLY IS HIGH, AND DEMAND IS LOW. COMPARE COMPANIES, AND LOCK IN YOUR RATES!

* ALL of the dorms have a kitchen.

* NOT all of them have AC units. I know that Speed doesn't, they're only in a few rooms in Deming, and BSB has them in every room. Not sure about the triplets though.

* Strategically speaking, BSB and Deming are top choice since they're closest to the academic buildings. Now, Deming is closer to the Union (with the cafeteria) than BSB, but BSB is closer to the parking lots and is only about 5 steps from the closest academic building. (They're all linked.) That's important for when it rains or snows.

* The triplets have the nicest common areas, and BSB probably has the worst. Of course, if you're in BSB you'll probably spend more time in the SA room, RA room, or your group of friends will settle on a room to hang in.

* BSB has the largest rooms.

If he stays healthy and sober, Williams is a serviceable LT. If he dedicates himself, he could become a good LT. Lichtensteiger at LG, Montgomery at C, and Chester at RG are all good.

We *only* play with the core sets of both games, and I find that they're pretty well balanced -- usually I'll win a game, then she'll win a game, etc.  Without buying the extra cards, you're more at the mercy of the draw, but the core sets are still rather fulfilling and fun.

Overall, I'm very happy with both purchases, though I think I like GoT a little better (I'm way into the source material right now), though the art isn't as nice as on the Warhammer cards.

Let's say Zimmerman was carrying a long hunting knife.  Let's say the same thing went down but ended with Martin being stabbed.  Do we blame hunting knives?  Do we blame whoever sold him the knife?  Do we blame the laws for allowing him to have a hunting knife?

I say NO, fuck that.  We must take personal responsibility for our own actions and hold others to the same account.  

And, if the reports are true that Martin followed Zimmerman back to his car and started beating the piss out of him, then that carry permit may have saved Zimmerman's life.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Very good advice.  
I think the last part ""Instead be a friend but casually flirt and increase how much you flirt the more you find you like a girl."" has a big potential for backfiring if she's uninterested. Your persistence may be viewed as creepy if she's not interested, or ""confident and cute"" if she IS interested. This is why I wish I could read minds, especially when I flirt with a friend to no avail one moment, then they act like we're dating in the next moment.   
  
It's funny how things can go completely opposite ways:  
""Tell me how you met?""  
Answer 1:""Well he asked me out and I said no...but he kept asking and asking,  he wasn't gonna take no for an answer! I finally gave in and said yes...it was so sweet, he wouldn't give up till he had me all to himself, and we've been together for 20 years ever since!""  

Answer 2: ""Well he asked me out and I said no....but he kept asking and asking, he wasn't gonna take no for an answer! I finally gave in and got a restraining order, so now that creepy fucker leaves me alone.

He spent an hour talking about his discovery of pot in Too Fat for 40, which was a good story but a testimony to how far he had fallen in terms of what is relevant for him to discuss.  Sure it was a good story, but it wasn't topical like what people preferred.  The first DVD was the best cause he dropped names.

He was always self-deprecating and foolish - he put himself in a massive credit card debt to make Clerks, which turned out to be great for him.  Still a very stupid thing to do.  He will always be the first one to pan his movie rather than the critics.  That made him endearing to people but that could only last so long.

One night after a long night of binge drinking, I got a ride home from my then dealer, purchased eighth on the way, and put it in my pocket. I stumbled my way in the front door only to see my hyper conservative Mormon mother standing in front of me.

Mom: ""You're drunk arent you!?""

Me: ""N-No i'm *hiccup* not""

Mom:""You're lying. I can smell it and you can hardly stand up. You're going to sit with me on the couch and sober up so we can talk about this""

As I followed her to the living room all I could think about is what if she decided to check my pockets? (She would routinely do it looking for cigarettes/evidence of drinking) 

As I continued to freak while sitting next to her on the couch, I came up with a brilliant plan to reduce my chances of getting caught. I ninjaly shoved the eighth between the arm rest and the seat cushion and told myself I'd get it the next day. 

Fast forward 2-3 months, walk in the living room to watch TV after school only to see my mom and young brother casually watching TV with the eighth just chillin on the coffee table. I assumed i was in deep shit so i just sat on the couch awaiting the verbal punishment. She said nothing... After an hour or so I figured they no idea and attempted to casually pick it up while leaving the room. As soon as I felt victorious I hear ""Why did you put that moldy stuff in your pocket?"" and proceeded to take it back and open it up. ""THIS IS WEED ISNT IT?!"" *Que long speech.. ""drugs are bad"" and ""weed makes you stupid""

"Anarchism","t5_2qh5j","You are assuming they would plant more treas.  This is an assumption not borne out by existing capitalism unfortunately.  If you are concerned about language, I suppose you ought to drop the ""capitalist"" because we anarchists are going to hold you to it.  As for the available evidence, we have the actions of capitalists and the historical record, which shows beyond a doubt that capitalism is a state-based economic relationship, from formation to present.  You'll try to wiggle out of this with your special definitions of capitalism (unique to ancaps, interestingly), but the evidence even shows that markets come from states, so you still have a problem.  

The final straw is that ancaps, when it comes to the poor and working class, almost always take the side of the boss in conflict.  This usually takes the form of ""just get another job"" or ""no one is forcing your to work there"" which, aside from being straight up idiotic, point to the fact that when ancaps apply their theories of capitalism, they throw their special language out the door when it comes to the status quo.  If this isn't capitalism as you would like it, then you should have no problem with me and my fellow workers either expropriating the workplace and setting the boss's mansion on fire, or redistributing all of her wealth.

Nope. She needs to stay in her personal boundaries where she is comfortable. In no way should she force herself or be forced into sexual encounters that she doesn't want to be involved in.

- If it's untrue and harmful, it may be defamation, which is illegal.  
- If it endangers people it may not be protected speech (e.g. screaming ""he's got a gun!"" in a showing of Batman, if nobody actually has a gun).  
- If you are pretending to be an expert and the state licenses that particular kind of expert (e.g. a doctor) then you may be practicing without a license or committing malpractice.
- If you threaten someone's life, the threat itself may be illegal.
- If you are screaming an explicit description of sex acts in public, and a minor hears you, you may be liable for some obscenity charges.

But look at the Westboro Baptist Church.  They are completely within their First Amendment rights to say things like ""God Hates Fags"" and so forth... but they are still assholes.

That being said, they don't make it easy on you, and even telephone service seems limited in what they will tell you (no hand holding!). 

If you're with Sallie Mae though, I might be able to help a bit. Log into your online account, and hover over Customer Support -&gt; Forms Center. Scroll down and find the IBR documents. If you filed taxes this year (as in had enough income to declare), you send Sallie Mae the form. It basically authorizes them to contact the IRS to get a copy of your tax return, they have to get it directly from the IRS. As you might expect, they will drag their feet, but if they don't get it in in time, as long as your paperwork is in, you are placed on a temporary deferment until they make a decision. If they don't, call them and make sure that you get that deferment. 

If you didn't make enough to pay taxes this past year (which was my case last year), you need to use the alternate documentation form. I'm not sure what is the ""prime"" thing, but I actually sent them bank statements for 3-4 months so they could see that there was not any source of income and wrote a letter in which I gave the info of my parents (was living with them) and said that all living expenses were being paid by them. 

Even if you get on it they aren't that good on contacting you. I mailed them all my information and they went silent until suddenly my monthly bills started dropping in with a $0 due. Also keep in mind that you have to ""reapply"" yearly. From what I recall you can't be booted off the program (worst case is you make enough money to pay full monthly amounts as you would under 10 yr repayment), but they do need to recalculate your income. I started working mostly after 2011-2012 taxes were due, so this year I plan on calling them and asking if copies of my pay stubs are acceptable.

"pics","t5_2qh0u","top left pic: I can see one strap saying 5D MK iii (top left shelf, middle), so assuming they are all the same model (I would guess it would either be that camera or a 1DX which is a lot more expensive, so this would be a minimum guess. These are Canon's 2 professional level DSLRs) each shelf is 7 across and 3 deep, and there are 10 shelves in that picture if you imagine a similar shelf cut out from the frame in the bottom left. I would estimate that since there are cameras missing there is about the equivalent of 8 or 9 full shelves there, which makes it about 190 cameras. Looking online the body only is around £2800, so in that picture alone there is about £530,000 / $830,000 of equipment

It's hard to estimate the other pictures because it's hard to see which exact lens they are, but they are all L-series lenses which are Canon's top line, and are anywhere from £1500 - £10,000. Top right and bottom left pictures look to be fast prime lenses, based on online prices and a quick count I would estimate about 60 lenses in the top right pic and 108 in the bottom left (2 deep - can tell from other picture of the other side of the shelf unit, 6 along, 9 shelves) and £5000 average price would be about £850,000 or $1.3mil.

Bottom right pic I have no idea what they could be, look like small L-series zoom lenses which are a bit cheaper (relatively) to the big ones. Top middle shelf looks to be 24-70mm 2.8 and maybe a few fisheyes too.

TLDR: I would estimate at least £1.5 million / $ 2 Million RRP

EDIT: Ah didn't see the higher-res photos linked, in the top left they are 4 deep instead of 3. Changes it to £630,000 / $1,000,000 in that pic I would say.","1343779403"

They would not have a voice change, and they would not develop excess hair on their bodies. They would also not look like large children, as there is still development that happens, it is simply different - for males you would be missing many of the masculine facial features, and it would be closer to that of a young boy in structure, but still obviously not a young boy.","1343779403"

While the word itself has little to nothing to do with regulation, cartels are really only maintained by artificial barriers to entry. 
Because if the cartel were in a free market, a market without artificial barriers to entry, than at the first sign of price fixing competition could enter the market and undercut them and even if, for some reason, no competition entered, every single member of the cartel has the incentive to undercut their cartels buddies and reap their costumer base.

"AskWomen","t5_2rxrw","I'm guessing you're oblivious because you're not used to talking to women and/or you don't think enough of yourself to consider the fact that women would be interested in you.  I can't help with the second--that has to come from within.  Confidence develops naturally with experience and the right attitude toward success and failure.  When you have confidence, your self-esteem is strengthened.  So, we're going to concentrate on the first one to help you get the second.

Connecting is a good place to start. It's like riding a bike: you gotta start with training wheels. When you get your sense of balance, then they can come off.  So, how would you meet women? The first thing is to get over the fear of women. We're humans. Really. I bet a hundred different women on this forum could write the same exact thing you just did. 

So first we need you to connect with us as friends, so you get used to thinking of us as people you can approach. Everyone loves friends. When you can count women among your friends, your social circle will have expanded. Even if you never get confident about approaching women, you will have more friends, do more things, live a happy life.  I assume you do fun interesting things. I assume some of these things women also do. Can you join co-ed sports leagues? Maybe volunteer on the weekends? Browse meetup for things in your area? 

Right now, you're doing it to make friends. Some will be women, some will be men. You're doing it to enjoy yourself, learn knew skills, get better at old ones. You're going to meet lots of people. Some will annoy you. Some will seem really awesome... only to later turn out to be jerk-faces. Some will blow you away, and continue you to do so weeks later because they're so cool.

You're joining this to socialize, to broaden your social network. So yes, in that sense, you're doing it to ""just meet women"". But in reality, it's so much more.  Don't treat it as an opportunity to find a date for next week's happy hour. Treat it as an opportunity to meet new people. At least for now. And down the road a bit.... it's okay to do things for multiple reasons.

Alternatively, do you have friends with girlfriends?  Can you hang out with them in group settings someway? Maybe invite them over for a BBQ at your place? Host a board game night? Invite them out to the beach for the day?

But, I think once you start interacting with us, connecting with us, someone will probably catch your eye, and you'll feel confident in your ability to connect with us as friends (and the basis of healthy romantic relationships is friendship...) to ask her out. Who knows, she may even see you for who you are and ask YOU out.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","the point  of people (especially pros) getting dorans is so they don't fall behind early, or to extend an advantage. especially at high levels of play, players will want to press advantages early and often (usually by forcing trades). as an ad carry, if i go double dorans vamp zerkers, and my opponent has zerkers and bf sword, i'm going to try to zone him or kill him at every opportunity. this is because i know i have better fight potential at that moment. dorans items give the best stats for their cost out of every item, so if you spend the same amount of money on dorans as others do on 1 major item, you are going to be stronger.

on top of this, dorans give all around great stats. ring gives ap's ap, mana regen, and health; all the stats ap casters need. same with blades for ad carries/aggressive brusiers/ad casters and assassins; and the same again with shields for tanks.

if you spend the money that could get 2 dorans rings on a blasting wand, you only get 1 of the 3 necessary stats (ap), and this will leave you weaker in a 1v1 vs the other ap mid (assuming he got 2 dorans).

however, the disadvantage to dorans is they take up an inventory slot for something that you cannot build into a better item. therefore if you can get an early lead (like most teams do with alistar jungle) than getting a big item when around 1k gold ahead will make you much stronger in the long run, and you won't be far behind early (because you have a 1k gold lead)","1343779412"

Certain champs scale really well off their base values alone and don't need lots of AP/AD/Tanking early game to do their thing. For example TF + GP10 is a common thing I saw lots of pros doing, TF was able to stay back in lane and farm with Q and then gank with his ult so his damage wasn't that much of a factor early on.

 Nunu can run full GP10 setup while jungling and end up WAY ahead if the game lasts 25+ minutes. Alistar, naut, blitz, are other examples of champs that don't need items to be effective really early on. In the end you have to look at what you're trying to accomplish and how your champ will fare without that dorans, catalyst or phage early on. ","1343779416"

In America, generally, elite gymnasts come from middle class to upper middle class families, where if they didn't want to compete, then they would probably see an INCREASE in their quality of life.

You wouldn't need to give polygamists any extra tax benefits, just the same ones that already apply to married couples. They could file a joint tax return, and all the spouses and incomes could be added to that return.

Obviously this isn't perfect, seeing how I wrote this just now, but I'm sure people more qualified than myself could add qualifiers to limit fraudulent filers and improve on it.

I agree with the other's rest it as much as you can the week before, if you must do exercise then do exercises that **do not** cause the ITBS pain.

A few things that helped me a bit (to manage it on race day):

* IT band strap (although not entirely sure if it had much/if any affect)

* Shortened my stride, upped my cadence (maybe like most/all runner's it hurt at the point where my left knee was fully extended), so I shortened my stride doing the ""ironman shuffle"" as they call it and that made sure my IT band wasn't rubbing as much

* Maybe not so relevant but other things were hurting at that point so although my IT band was complaining a bit it was tossed in the mill with all the other aches and pains of the day :)

I found my snowboard bag which had my snowboard bindings in it was missing, knowing there was nothing I could do about it and feeling like an idiot I moved on. A year later I was snowboarding at our local hill with my friends. One of my friends with me rode up and pointed to a kid and said ""hey nacho, aren't those your bindings that went missing?"" (the bindings were union forces that I customized by swapping parts with my friends, so I knew they were mine because there weren't any other pair out there on the market.).... so fast forward, we asked the kid about them, first he said his dad got them on the internet. We asked him what website, he said craigslist, then ebay, and kept changing up his story. He must have knew he had been caught because after this he rode down the hill away from us as if he was going to the parking lot. We followed him, he took the long way around the lodge (parking lot was 10 feet in front of him, so he walks 1000 feet around the lodge?) Anyways before this gets too long, I went to the cop who was patrolling the parking lot at the hill that day and he confronted the kid and the kid broke down and gave them back. Justice had been served. 

TL:DR; Caught dumb kid who stole my custom snowboard bindings out of my car one year later and got them back","1343779437"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","WAAAAY too many to list, but my FAVOURITE has to be from three years ago when myself and my SO got picked up by this little old lady and her little old husband, niether of which spoke a LICK of english, only french.

They picked us up outside Thunderbay Ontario, and drove us roughly 6-8 hours to Sault Ste Marie. We kept trying to converse, but none of us had ANY idea what anyone else was saying. Then about an hour or so into the trip, the little old guy goes into his glove box, and pulls out the BIGGEST joint I've ever seen and lights it! This guy had to have been like 75+ years old, and him and his wife (I assume) just started puff puffing away and passing it back to me and my girlfriend.

From that point on, not a word was said, but every half hour he'd light another joint and pass it back. I found it hilarious that even though NONE of us had any idea what was being said, we'd all four of us just spontaneously burst into fits of giggles and laughter.

"gaming","t5_2qh03","I played Rift last year when it came out. I may as well have played a single player game. From the first moment you start, you get sent on a lovingly crafted series of quests, sent from quest hub to quest hub. You never needed help finishing these quests. Because many of them were chains, you couldn't team up easily(since of course you can't jump into the middle of the quest chain). And even then you only stick around a quest hub for 30 minutes to an hour tops.


Soo.. Yeah. There is zero community, zero cooperation needed. Its just a miserable solo grind of quest after quest that you don't even stop to read after a while. Just follow the prompts, get reward, move on.

I'll take a good EQ camp any day for leveling. At least then you socialize with people during the frequent down times. 

Camps for items... I think I could do without that. Or at least get rid of the concept of a rare item on a rare spawn. But I'd prefer fancy items be gotten from long quest chains that take a lot of effort. Leave the leveling to hillside grinds.


Also, am I the only one who really loved the 8 spell limit for spell slots? It made you think about what you needed, what was useful, etc. Honestly, when Diablo 3 implemented their new system, first thing I thought was 'Oh, its like the EQ spell slot system'.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I think Pandora, etc. are fantastic resources for discovering music, but the problem with all of the music services is quality.  That might sound snobbish, but to a lot of people, there's a very discernible difference between the sound of streaming audio coming through laptop speakers or a headphone jack and a CD or record played through a decent system.  

As someone who recognizes and appreciates all the hard work and attention that musicians and engineers put into their craft, I feel that listening to a lousy digital version of a song does everyone involved - especially the listener - a disservice.  I guess sometimes it doesn't matter, but to me, great music is something to be revered and treated accordingly.  Listening to 128 kbps mp3s of your favorite album through some shitty earbuds is like boiling a perfect cut of prime rib and putting ketchup on it.  

It's usually not too hard to find high quality versions of what you're looking for on torrents and download sites.  I worked in a record store for about 5 years and this is ultimately why it shut down and I lost the best job I've ever had.  That's just how it goes and I understand that it's not going to go away.  I still buy as much music as I can, but I've also downloaded tons of music from filesharing sites myself.  

At the end of the day, you can't *make* someone care and most people won't.  It's a two-way street, though.  If the artists you love aren't making a living because you can't/won't pay for their art, they might stop caring, too.  Show them some support.  For every album you rip, buy a few mp3s or a t-shirt and some stickers or something.  It's not as much as they deserve, but most will never get that anyway, and every little bit helps.  

If you truly love what someone does and have even the slightest grasp of how much blood, sweat and tears go into making that music, it's the very least you can do.    

And for fucksake, get some decent headphones.  They're not that expensive, sound a helluva lot better, are more comfortable in most situations, and won't ruin your hearing nearly as bad as earbuds will.  ","1343779450"

I'm sure it's not how they work in AP. And of course SPPs that the player builds as part of missions require Crystals, but all of the default SPPs I've looked at have Crystals listed as a secondary, and they seem to have a lot more Crystals in stock and the Universe could possibly be producing.

GoD took all the Ore out of my Ore Belt - didn't even leave any vacant asteroids where the mines were, then it brought them all back one at a time over the course of a day.

This morning it had taken the SPP in M148 - where I have a lot of external CLSes and a food complex. 

Then when I checked this evening, it had built two Medium Weapons complexes in M148. So I upgraded my food complex to an SPP loop with extra food, and it's going gang busters now.

I think in AP, GoD may be a little more helpful than in TC. I think it might get rid of all of it's resourceless SPPs as you begin to build your own factories.

And FWIW, the AP Plots give you all the same rewards without he ridiculous wares delivery requirements of TC.

"electronic_cigarette","t5_2qmlu","Nice write up! I am in love with my rebuildables, but there's still that nagging feeling of finding the perfect setup that's easy to rebuild, looks nice, performs consistently, and can last for a long time. There will always be different levels of features and gimmicks, but I agree, once you find a rebuildable you like, you're pretty much independent of hardware vendors. It's pretty easy to stock up on wire and wick/mesh to last a long time and then you're down to just juice, batts, and maybe a pretty new mod every now and then. I've been slowly acquiring rebuildables for all my mods and I'm looking forward to not having to buy atties or cartos anymore. The last holdout for me has been a bottom feeding rebuildable, but I'm in a coop for the ERA bottom feed RBA from the Philippines, and I'm really hoping that will be the end-all-be-all for me. With DIY juice and rebuildable atties/tanks, you basically just need to stock up on the ingredients and you're done. It will definitely be interesting to see how the market changes as these gain even more popularity and availability. Thanks for the input.","1343779459"

First mistake.  Doing cardio for fat loss is a waste of time.  Adjust your diet instead.  The cardio should be to improve your blood pressure.

Second mistake.  You won't just wake up one day and look like a pro body builder.

Liberty does not give one the right to infringe upon anyone else's liberty, safety, or dignity (that is liberty (free speech) is not the right to act immorally.)

Setting aside the problems with deducing immutable truths about human behavior from chimpanzees (we have as much genetic code in common with bonobos as we do with chimpanzees, and the former resolve conflicts not with violence but with sex), the study you link to involves a situation of artificial scarcity being imposed upon the subject chimpanzees -- the very opposite of the dynamics of a communist society.

Moving back to the original point: you are simply asserting that humans are inherently predisposed toward theft or selfishness. But this is flatly contradicted by the many examples of pre-class societies that don't have these ailments, many of which are described in [Engels' Origin of the Family, Private Property, and the State](http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1884/origin-family/index.htm). It's a Marxist classic and you should definitely take a look at it, as it provides a very sharp answer to the age-old contention that socialism and communism run counter to human nature.

"Anarcho_Capitalism","t5_2qorf","&gt;we shouldn't so hubristically claim a human-centric ethos is what the Universe has ordained for all of reality.

I'm not looking at this from a ""Universal"" point of view in the sense that ""the universe"" has ordained it.  I'm saying that - just like humans have two eyes - they have an objective moral code *inherent to their being*.

Guilt is the most obvious introspective proof.  *All humans* experience guilt.  By definition, guilt is the result of violation of a moral code - it *cannot* be due to mere subjective preference, as *regret* is.  These are distinct states.

&gt;But, it's far from the truth to equate me with a murderer, thief, or rapist. In practice, I'm indistinguishable from a de-ontological ancap.

In thought, you are nearly the exact opposite - content with ""whatever works"" for your purposes.

&gt;One could be threatened with violence, death, or the destruction of what s/he cares about if they do not assist in the building of certain structures, materials, etc.. In such an instance, even as inadvisable as or immoral a course of action might be to you, its execution does not mean the actor shared the exact same preferences as Hitler.

Excepting the possibility of sabotage, you would be right.  Unfortunately, sabotage is not only an option, but a quite successful one given the fact that they needed to come to you in the first place.

&gt;I never said that in the objective sense in which you want or think morality to be or can be.

Then you should refrain from making moral arguments like ""you should too"".  The ""should"" or ""ought"" realm *is entirely moral*, and has nothing to do with self-interest.  Of course, you are also presupposing that people *should act in a self-interested manner* with regards to ends *you* think should fit that.

&gt;There's a subconscious Id that predates all of your ""conscious decision-making."" There is something so fundamental to the fabric of who you are that it is beyond your questioning of it. You, like Mises and I concede, must take it for granted.

I'll let Mises himself answer your nonsense this time:

&gt;Action is will put into operation and transformed into an agency, is aiming at ends and goals, is the **ego's meaningful response** to stimuli and to the conditions of its environment, is a person's **conscious adjustment** to the state of the universe that determines his life.

I am referring to human action, not mere impulse.  Further, as I pointed out, the conscious mind *chooses between contradictory impulses constantly*, and can even - as you, yourself, point out - negate those necessary for very survival.

The subconscious Id cannot make decisions - only stress optional ends.  It cannot make decisions because *it is self-contradictory*.  I have, for example, an impulse to take as much leisure time as possible, and another to work as long as possible to better my situation.  It is the *ego* that must decide between those.

&gt;Many of us see this trade-off right now and elect for civilization over barbarism.

Moral judgments from a subjectivist.  These are all over the place.  If you were truly being subjective there can be no such thing as 'barbarism' or 'civilization'.  There would only be what exists and what is preferred - and only on an individual level.

&gt;when consequentialists make recommendations, they're doing it purely out of self-interest.

Then you cannot say that *I should do anything*, without having evaluated my goals.  You certainly cannot say *I should accept your ends as meaningful for me to seek*.

&gt;Why? What if they're a criminal?

If they are a criminal, they are violating your domain, and not the other way around.

&gt;But, there are no objective or logical reasons to adopt it.

So you claim.  I find your claim to be groundless, for multiple reasons.  For one, people will invariably find actions taken against them to be wrong - they protest.  You cannot protest such action without objective morality - you are arguing that another person (for instance, those running the State) should be held to a moral standard *that you share*.

For a somewhat silly example, in a Calvin and Hobbes cartoon, Calvin was proclaiming that he didn't believe in ethics, that it's a dog eat dog world, that if someone is in your way you have to push them out of the way to get ahead, and that the end justifies the means. All of a sudden, Hobbes shoves Calvin to the ground. Calvin yells WHY DID YOU DO THAT? Hobbes replies, "" You were in my way. Now you're not. The end justifies the means.""

Further, there are always some consistencies.  ""Men have differed as to whether you should have one wife or four. But they have always agreed that you must not simply have any woman you liked.""

Even a murder will not argue that murder is acceptable as a subjective value, and he just disagrees with everyone else.  He will maintain his innocence of the charge - that what he did was *not really* murder when all the facts are examined, because of X, Y, and Z.  (Of course, you may argue that his long-run interest is to try to get off, but then you would still have to explain why no individual who is not committing murders argues the same idea.)

""[Quarreling] looks, in fact, very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of Law or Rule of fair play or decent behavior or morality or whatever you like to call it, about which they really agreed. And they have. If they had not, they might of course, fight like animals, but they could not quarrel in the human sense of the word. Quarreling means trying to show that the other man is in the wrong. And there would be no sense in trying to do that unless you and he had some sort of agreement as to what Right and Wrong are; just as there would be no sense in saying that a footballer had committed a foul unless there was some agreement about the rules of football.""","1343779467"

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","You are right that simply having the shit-testing done to us isn't firm enough ground to necessarily be upset past the point of being annoyed. However, in relation to the direction I believed the thread was going, being shamed, emasculated, dehumanized, etc., over failing it, which seems to us men as minuscule in importance at best, is what drives us to find such bitterness in the nature. It's like being asked to give a brief oral synopsis of the events of Othello, and if you're wrong or just simply don't know, you get your car towed and your name listed in the newspaper. And on the off chance you're right or lucky, then nothing happens and all is normal. It's a rather ridiculous endeavor from most men's experiences. 

As far as pushing legislation for this, I thought they were just over exaggerating their disapproval of shit-testing; I highly doubt they seriously believed there should be a law against it. I think they were more leaning towards the idea that it should be socially removed as an acceptable action. But, as someone had mention later (I think it was you actually), that the shit-testing is more instinctual than anything, women can't control it. But the humility and disrespect that often comes from failing it is what men want to do away with. This is what I was getting from the discussion. ","1343779467"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","Yes, I always wondered that anyone could write a book based entirely on the interviews of members of the company. That would be like asking Patton to write an unbiased version of the war. Who do you think Patton's going to make look good? Where are the opponents? Not even the points of view of ANYONE else in the battalion?

I wonder how did one company get SO heroic? Not making light of their achievements, but it is blown out of proportion. Dick Winters is a hero and his DSC (and MOH nomination) says so. But how many other men got DSCs or even MOHs? And this is just the Americans, what about all other forces? The 101st got two Presidential Unit Citations. Easy Company never did. Hell, the 506th never got one. For all we know every single company in the 101st was like them. Numerous companies, RCTs, and battalions got the award, especially a lot from the 82nd Airborne. Where are they in the story?

I think Easy Company started out as a project to show how in war men show their best and worst qualities, and just about any man could become a great man or a hero. It ended up being a cult fest on Easy Company, and people have lost sight of how heroism was everywhere.","1343779469"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Since other people gave the interpretation, I'll give this unsolicited and probably unwanted grammar lesson. The underlying sentence is
&gt;Athletes inspire fans.

We can use ""just"" to say inspiration is the only thing they offer:
&gt;Athletes just inspire fans.

But AT&amp;T wants to say they offer more than that, so they negate the sentence with ""don't"":
&gt;Athletes don't just inspire fans.

However, they put those things in the wrong order, which completely changed the meaning. First they said that athletes are not inspirational:
&gt;Athletes don't inspire fans.

Then they said that the only thing they do is not be inspirational:
&gt;Athletes just don't inspire fans.

I think there's more to it grammatically involving the role of ""do"" as an auxiliary verb, emphatic versus negative, but I can't figure it out.

"WTF","t5_2qh61","There is merit in what you're saying - but I still cannot agree. If islam was not a religious belief system which is absolutist and seeks to establish a theocracy - it simply wouldn't matter. When I see Sikh men in turbans, I am quite happy for them. When I see Sikh women wear leggings for modesty, it simply is not an issue. When I see Orthodox Jews wear side locks and nineteenth century clothes - or the Amish wear early nineteenth century clothing - none of this is in any way an issue. None of these belief systems seeks to impose itself on everyone. None claim to be beyond criticism or secular law. None o them burn embassies or detonate bombs when a cartoon is published. None see themselves as being a special case. None are quite so hyper sensitive to criticism. None have rape laws and shariah courts which hand down horrific and vile treatment to women. None seek to create a caliphate. Islam does. Therefore what I see in the burka is not simply a personal choice. It is a choice which its adherents seek to impose on all. I think France has it right - those who live in our society have certain moderate expectations placed upon them. If the covering is banned actually there may be many women who would find themselves considering a freedom they would not have considered themselves. There are none so oppressed as those who voluntarily close their own jail cell doors and hand over the keys 'for their own safety'.","1343779471"

A little back story first. I signed myself up on OkCupid last April/May, just for shits and giggles. Didn't think anything would come of it, but I stayed hopeful. I noticed a girl on there who lived kind of close, and was really cute, with an intelligently funny profile. She immediately sparked my interest, but with having no college education, or good career worthy job, I didn't think I had the chance. I wanted to make sure I make a good impression with my first message, so I spent a week trying to perfect it. That didn't work and I got fed up and just let her know I thought she was pretty and funny and wanted to get to know her over dinner. I'd wait a week and if nothing came of it I'd just delete my profile and give up. She responded the next day and we set a date. The day of I was excited, yet terrified. bought a new outfit, made sure everything was as perfect as possible, the whole nine yards. We talked rather easily and came to find out our 98% match on okcupid was actually completely correct. We have some differences, but nothing negative. Most of our interests are the same, tastes in music, love of movies, and being outdoors. So anyways, after dinner we went on a walk around the city, and ended the night soon after. We pretty much each said we we were interested in each other, and I even grew the balls to go in for a kiss. Next date was locked in.
 We became serious after only a few dates and I couldn't be happier. She finds a way to make me laugh every day and I'm looking forward to a long life together with her. She's not a redditor (or so she says) so she won't see this.
TL;DR OkCupid worked for me","1343779474"

I have another idea, and it's that you could make a call and arrange to use the [casino shuttle](http://www.victoriacasinogambling.com/) to get from where you are to the casino, which happens to also be right by a major bus terminal in Langford, which you could then use to get downtown.  I don't know if it'd work but maybe.","1343779479"

i fail to see the relevance of context here.  hes just showing how ridiculous our legal system is and how something like that can happen.

regardless of details, those two acts SHOULD NEVER be treated as the same and the fact that you can get the same sentence for both is insane.

9 pounds isnt very much in terms of trafficking and is less than $20,000.  im not sure how that equals assaulting a little girl, but then again it must be the context...

edit:i said 9 pounds to show how context wouldnt really matter.

theres packages leaving town here with 5-10 times that much and if he would have been busted with lets say 100 pounds, would that be any different than the 9 he was caught with?

does 100 pounds of weed equal sexually assaulting little girls?  

i also said rape because thats what instantly came to my mind when i read sexually assaulted.   someone suggested a bra strap snap could have been the act that resulted in sexual assault.  one has a victim, one doesnt.  one has a little girl being scared and afraid of a (bra strap, hairy penis, insert context here) and one is victimless.

Aside from that, consider dropping the optical drive and picking up a cpu cooler like the hyper 212+.

Also you can probably step down to 8gb of ram, I know you will be video editing, but unless you plan on using after effects heavily you would be fine with 8gb, it is also very easy to add on to later.

With your case, I don't particularly like it, there are better cases for that price such as the NZXT Source 210 Elite and the CM 690II

For your psu, you can get an OCZ modular one for cheaper, just thought I would let you know.

As to why the person you mentioned might feel that way, you might like to consider taking a look through some of the books in the recommended reading. In particular, Harris' *Letter to a Christian Nation* and Hitchens' *God Is Not Great* might speak to, and help explain, that kind of sentiment.

Well, maybe the _real_ way to deter people isn't just long sentences, it's sentences that run on and on with no clear purpose, with a stream-of-consciousness structure that includes apparent non sequiturs such as the fact that I taught my cat to do tricks simply by rewarding the behavior I liked, and if that's not enough of a deterrent, perhaps we should try using sentences that contains some many grammatical errors and spellings mistaches that it really does serve as a deterrent, and if u rnt de-turred bi that 4 starters, we can reely mak u sffr.

Because the one thing that torrenting or giving your music away for free doesn't hurt is ticket sales to a band's concert. In fact it only helps. Because the more people hear your music the more people you have that will potentially buy tickets to your show. And bands didn't really make any money off of album sales unless they were in the millions anyway and FUCK Creed. 

So personally I think EVERY band should just give their music away for free.","1343779491"

Whenever she mentions that she has a busy work week coming up, I cringe knowing she'll probably have a freakout. But I'll do my best to help- clean the house a bit, offer to make dinner.

"running","t5_2qlit","I am a huge advocate of low heart rate training.  I basically languished around a couple years after I started running, doing 20-30 mpw and two speed workouts a week, and getting injured fairly often.  Then I found an epic low heartrate training thread on the (now defunct) coolrunning message board and jumped in on it.  I was able to raise my mileage very quickly and haven't been sidelined by an injury since.  I did nothing but maffetone paced runs for a year and built up a huge base and massively improved my times.

I haven't read Rich Roll's book, but maybe I should, even though I don't do ultras.  How does he calculate his training zones?

Some other resources for you to consider are [The Article that Started it All](http://www.philmaffetone.com/files/Want_Speed_Slow_Down_2007.pdf), Maffetone's Big Book of Endurance Training and Racing, Slow Burn (by Stu Mittleman -- there is another book called Slow Burn about weightlifting which is unrelated), Hadd.pdf (just google it), and Healthy Intelligent Training (no heart rate content, but it validates the methods).  There's a group on RunningAhead full of people who follow low heart rate training that post daily as well.  

Also another guy that I really like is Joe Henderson and his Long Slow Distance philosophy.  You can get his books on kindle for like $2.99 each.  Keep in mind they are from the seventies.  They don't mention heart rate (because monitors werent available then that could be used in the field), but his training style is the same.

And anything you can find by or about Ernst Van Aaken.  Another guy who trained runners this way before heart rate monitors came out.

If you don't read anything else, my advice to you is that if you want to do this, use it as an opportunity to ramp up your mileage.  Whether or not there's anything ""magic"" about 180 minus your age, or whatever you choose, the thing about running super easy is that it allows you to run LOTS.  In all of the old threads/groups, the ones who improved most are the ones who used it as a way to ramp up their mileage.




Edit:  I just bought it on Kindle and read the chapter on training.  It looks like he's using the Joe Friel approach (specifically, the lactate threshold test gave it away, and the fact that his coach primarily trains triathletes).  It's pretty solid.  You don't have to get the lab test, you can do it in the field.  [Here's how.](http://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/2010/03/physiological-fitness-lactate-threshold.html).  and [Here's how to find Zone 2 based on your lactate threshold](http://www.trainingbible.com/joesblog/2009/11/quick-guide-to-setting-zones.html).  More information in his book Total Heart Rate training (but note he does not advocate a low heart rate (ie zone 2 only) approach in it ... my understanding is that a lot of triathletes do this, however).  Friel Z2 training works great, personally I prefer Maffetone though  (its a little bit slower for me).","1343779494"

Angelic Intervention should maybe just say ""your creatures become 4/4 with blah blah"", but worried that might be OP with all the 1/1's lying around. Needs playtesting.

Angry nutter should have enough counters, there should be lots of counters flying about. He can take all kinds of counters, including opponents. Again, might need playtesting. :)

A couple of the planeswalkers don't make sense, I agree. The one you mention (Chagnar Faugn) I've had trouble figuring out, especially since I'm pretty satisfied with the other elder gods. I'll look closer into that and Balder. Don't really know what they would actually do as magic cards, since they're both *ahem* 'real' gods.

Color balance, creatures vs spells, all that will be more finetuned when I'm getting closer to done. Work in progress etc!

For most players and most builds, the same set of three net properties (Damage/Mitigation/Vit) are what really matters, on a given item, for any slot.  For most slots, I can shop for all three of my A3 farming characters by changing nothing but the DamStat I'm shopping for.  Crit builds have that to worry about as well.  Attack Speed is also nice, but should be understood as Damage+ProcRate, rather than as a distinctive property of its own.  Then there's LoH.  That's about it, for most players.  
  
The upside is, this boring base set of stats doesn't preclude the introduction of further, more interesting stats.

We are looking for other people who want to start a LP inside a new world with other like minded members. The only major requirements are you doing recordings from the world, and you are serious about it (we aren't looking for people who are going to come and build a dirt house and never come back).

No age or subscriber requirements. As long as you can act mature and respectful of other peoples builds/videos, that's good enough. We don't care if you have 0 subs or 100,000 subs. 

Send me a message telling me about yourself, or even better a video. Even though a video application isn't required, it is a good idea. That way we could get a good idea about who you are, and verify you can actually record.

Any questions, feel free to post it here, or comment inside of the video.","1343779499"

"ECE","t5_2r2sg","Theory one: The closest you can get is by mimicking GPS. You'll need three transmitters with highly accurate atomic based clocks -- the easiest way to get the timebase is through GPS, but that would be undermining the whole purpose. You could use rubidium based clock-oscillators, but I don't know how that will affect accuracy; anyway, three transmitters; and a receiver that measures the difference in time of the signals received from the transmitters. Again, there is a tough timing challenge as with GPS the difference in time is milliseconds; line-of-sight terrestrial radio range is down to the micro and nanoseconds. Accuracy can be millimeters to kilometers, depending on how good the equipment is.

Theory two: Triangulation. This will require two to three base stations within line-of-sight range. You hold a transceiver that transmits an arbitrary tone that the base stations pick up and triangulate. Then they send position info to the handheld transceiver. Accuracy again lies in the equipment, but is doomed to be a lot less due to multipath and fading. Say a mountain is to the west of you and two of the bases pick up your transmission as a reflection from the mountain, while the station on the mountain picks up your true beacon to the east? Then you're position will be off by many miles. 

Theory Three: use infrared or GPS. ","1343779503"

Mine were certainly grained, though it was more a case of logistics than necessity. I got the leavings from a nearby market/deli (minus the pork, of course), and also the old, unsold produce from a supermarket in the next town over.

There were periods when that was the vast majority of the feed the pigs got (&gt;75%), and they did absolutely fine. Of course, in my state, that also meant that I couldn't legally sell the resulting pork to consumers, because the pigs were fed ""garbage"". This wasn't a problem, since the breed is critically endangered and I sold all of the piglets as future breeding animals. And it certainly didn't stop us from eating the pork, which is completely unlike ""the other white meat"", as you might imagine.

In my utterly humble and unbiased opinion (Ha!), feeding pigs ""garbage"" is the only environmentally reasonable way to raise pork. Too bad it's illegal.","1343779506"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","TL;DR: Yes and it's working.

Yeah, but I don't really blame them though. We've been here for almost 3 years, it's a small base with very little to do if you're used to city life, and temps around and above 110 for most of the year. There is hiking and camping, and lakes, which is how I grew up, which is only 3 hours away from here. But everyone else says there's nothing to do, so they drink, and they get in trouble, but they don't care and do it again, and again. Going an entire month without an alcohol related indecent is rare. We see 30 days up on the board by the gate and we're impressed.

So this summer they started cracking down, giving no more warning, which sucks for someone who screwed up once, but most of these people  have made a habit of it. They could do a general order 1, which bans alcohol completely from the base and keeps people out of the bars too, but that would mean the commanders would have to give up their alcohol too, which I guess they aren't willing to do since they've threatened a gen order 1 numerous times.

And I'm sick of the frat type guys getting everyone else in trouble. Some idiot gets in trouble over the weekend, EVERYONE has to come in and work the weekend, if their lucky. Sometimes they have to stand a parade attention out side in the heat for hours and hours for a uniform inspection. And this whole ""punish everyone"" thing doesn't work anymore. Back in the day the idiot would get his ass beat, but that's not acceptable anymore, he doesn't care. It's high school all over again.

So yeah, they are being discharged, no warnings, for alcohol related incidents, and guess what, the board by the gate says it's been 50 days since the last one.

Marriage is a Judeo-Christian institution. As a Pagan or Atheist, the government forces us to join in with a christian institution in order to get the same rights.

This, again, is the government barring people from certain rights unless they follow the 'christian' way, which, as a nation founded by atheists, heretics, pagans, and monotheists, which supposedly grants us freedom of religion, I find abhorrent.","1343779520"

I volunteer on some weekends and work on others which is good because it keeps me away from school. I feel like I haven't accomplished anything because there is so much I want to know and learn about. I have carefully selected over 700 books (on my amazon wish list) over the past 8 years that I would like to read someday, and I only have time to read maybe 3 a year right now. Also, I am not happy with my body, which makes me avoid a lot of contact, and I don't have the time to improve it - although I think I may try to implement a 3 day schedule rather than the 5 day schedule I used to use. I'm a biology major, I love the topic and most of the classes - I just hate how it ends up being more about trying to figure out what will be on the test than actually learning anything.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;&gt;Parents that are unable to support the child many times keep it, and the quality of life is very poor. 

OK, I assume this is of the premise that the parents are aware that they cannot provide for the child.  In which case they could give it up for adoption. Since neither of us KNOW when life begins, and we have a 100% foolproof solution to this problem without potentially ending a life, reason says adoption is fine.

&gt;&gt;There can be child abuse, abandonment, neglect, etc.

Again, see above.  Also, there can also be all of these things with regular, wanted pregnancies.  By this logic, ALL should be aborted, because there is a chance the parents suck.

&gt;&gt;Then even with adoption there are negative outcomes, the new parents could be abusive. 

Again, parents who are 100% not going to get an abortion can suck too.  Nothing here to do with abortion.  

&gt;&gt;If the child is carried to full term with the expectation of adoption, and the adopting parents back out, then the child can go to foster care and live that life.

Does this happen?  I was under the impression that it is difficult to find a baby to adopt in the US, and that most foster care children were brought there not as infants.

I feed my corn a fuzzy once a week, which is typically the amount of time it takes for the mouse to work its way through his digestive track. 

Also, some people recommend feeding in a separate tank to keep your snake from getting aggressive whenever you go to take him/her out. Some snakes might start to relate the opening of the tank to feeding time.

First off, you're making a staggering amount of assumptions regarding my political views, based entirely on my three, short sentences above. 

I'm *not* a Sverigedemokrat, in any way, shape, or form. I find their views on immigration and their general outlook on swedish society reprehensible. You know what else I find reprehensible? People like you who like ""educate"" people on, for example, reddit. These people you educate are most often foreign and are thus basically clueless about swedish society. You take this fact and use it to shove down your own distorted and biased views and feelings about Sweden into other people's throats.

Let's brake down your posts:

&gt;there are quite few both Jews and Slavs in Sweden. I don't blame them for moving

This is where I pointed out that you were wrong about Slavs moving out. I didn't put any thoughts or feeling into this fact. Instead you put words in my mouth.

&gt; theese things

This is where you  made the connection of the rise of neo-nazism in the 90's (or the fact that Sverigedemokraterna used to be much more extreme) to a decline in our jewish population. I corrected you, and I will do so further now: Today's politics and society have seen a shift from the 90's, where nazis are no longer as prevalent. You will probably agree with me that Sverigedemokraterna isn't targeting jews. So, why would a history of nazism in Sweden, a nazism that is heavily in decline, affect jews' desicion to move in any major way today? Especially when there are far more pressing concerns for them elsewhere.

&gt;jews and muslims are diverserse communities.

Where in my post did I state that *all* muslims took part in these activities? I simply stated that, if anyone is harassing jews to a point that would cause them to flee, then it is mostly caused by muslim people.

I don't need a history lesson. You can read my other posts in this thread to see how disappointed I am with how Per-Albin and the rest treated jews seeking refuge in Sweden. I also don't need a lesson about nationalism and how inane and destructive it is.

I definitely didn't want a lesson in how to write a pointless, completely erroneus, banal comment, written in such a manner as to produce as much vomit-inducing douchebaggery as possible. But that is what I received. I suggest you vent your built up, pseudo-intellectual anger elsewhere. ","1343779533"

"chicago","t5_2qh2t","Read comments about the Blue Dolphins, I have more to add. Due to them not practicing at the end of August at Moody Bible Institute, I've start to look at other teams.

The Chicago Masters (http://www.chicagomasters.com/ HORRIBLE WEBSITE from 1992) is another major team. They are more intense than Blue Dolphins; the practice is 1.5 hours long, the workouts look harder, and apparently there are 2 former Olympic swimmers that practice with them.

The only downside is that it is really early in the morning. They list 5:30 - 7:30 AM practice with a 30 min open swim warmup so the actual practice is 6-7:30. For me that would mean getting on the Halsted bus really early, like 5:30 am, uf.

From what I know, the coach is the actual UIC Men's swimming and diving coach and he is at the practices. The Yelp review is really positive and says that he 'checks in with every lane' during practice.

I emailed the coach to see if I can do a few practice sessions and he said that I can come up to 2 weeks to give the team a real try -- awesome. I'm going this Friday.

Morning practice is at UIC in the 'big' (50) pool. Chicago Blue Dolphins [currently] have the Moody pool, which is nice, but is a 25.

3. I've heard that if you delete/readd files to your SSD it can screw it up overtime, how many times do you have to repeat the process of deleting/readding before SSD starts to show its wearing and tearing?

4. If I have had my 1TB  HDD for almost a year now and I want to add a second one and put it in RAID 0 format, would I have to wipe my first drive before adding the second?

5. Will seagate mess up the Samsung Spinpoint F3 series? I really like that HDD and I want to add a second one but I've heard a lot of mixed reviews about seagate so I don't know what to do on this.

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","&gt;when you're a new mother on maternity leave it's your fucking job to breastfeed your kid and to take it on yourself to do the best you can

It's more complicated than that.  Yes, it's your job to take care of your kid the best you can, but for some women, breastfeeding is painful, very difficult, and not conducive to bonding because of those factors.  We like to imagine that mothers breastfeeding their babies are always gazing in rapture and flooded with bonding hormones, but it's not like that for everyone.

Some women don't have a full milk supply through no fault of their own (this actually happened to me with my 3rd baby, even though I was already an experienced breastfeeding mother and lactation specialist.  Sometimes body parts fail to work perfectly.  And I really don't need people in my business about why my baby is having a bottle when I apparently have breasts available.)  

I don't see many mothers who are like ""meh, breastfeeding is better, but I just don't feel like it.""  I do on the other hand see mothers who feel uncomfortable about it (unsurprising when our breasts have been so sexualized), but give it the old college try because they know it's better.  Most mothers work their butts off for their kids, and I think it sucks how much we judge mothers.  Especially when there is plenty of abusive and neglectful parenting out there that is *actually* harming kids.

As far as pushing a product, if the formula would be generic, would that make a difference?  Hospitals provide food for all other patients, why not infants?  It's not like a mother who wants to breastfeed will change her mind and use it just because it's there.","1343779540"

Should get near identical performance as your. A few weeks or months down the line you can add another identical RAM stick and it will improve performance

If you want to make it even cheaper, a 6850 will still play all those games at decent settings. Also you can get a monitor that isn't as good, but for $30 less.

Monitor is main part of build though - it's something you won't want to replace down the line. i'd suggest you keep same monitor.

btw for the RAM - a 1x4gb ddr3-1600 will be slightly faster; 1333 is almost same though. if you get one for $2-3 more, get it.

This build will perform slightly better in photoshop, actually. although it doesnt have 8gb of ram so not really.","1343779541"

Sometimes it makes me feel like an asshole, but really I have the option of doing things I am interested in or hanging out with people and not doing things I am interested in. 

I spend a lot of time on my own keeping myself busy, so if you want to hang out it better be something cooler than what I do on my own time or else I don't want to do it or take the time to be your friend.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","Fencing isn't as simple as giving each point to the competitor who isn't stabbed first.  When both players hit each other, priority is given to the player who starts their attacking motion first.  This is often a matter of judgement and has nothing to do with the lights.  For example, if I lunge to hit my opponent, I have priority.  If, however, my opponent blocks my sword and proceeds to hit me, my opponent gets the point even though both of our lights may go on.  (In fencing terminology, blocking the opponent and counterattacking is known as parry and riposte.)  The lights just indicate that the sword has contacted the opponent.  If you watch a match from close-up between quick fencers, you cannot possibly tell if the sword hit someone or missed by an inch.  That being said, decisions need to be made beyond who got hit first.

The other purpose of the ref is to manage the flow of the match.  Did a player intentionally step out of bounds?  Did a player position his swordless hand in front of his body illegally?  Is a replay needed?  These are questions where a human is needed to make a judgement.  Like most sports, the majority of calls are straightforward, but you always want a person to be there for those calls that aren't as obvious. ","1343779548"

"DotA2","t5_2s580","I recently went Viper against SF mid and it was pretty easy. 

I knew that @ lvl 1 and the standard SF starting items meant that he would most likely have 46 damage, while I hovered 53. I used this knowledge to my advantage and last hitted better than him knowing the fact I do more damage. I also made it so that if SF wanted to go in for creep kills/ denies, I can just orb walk him and he won't be able to retaliate. With (on average) 7 more damage than him, this meant that after 4 creep kills he would have a 1 damage advantage on me. I made his life difficult so that he couldn't get that 4 creep kills

So SF had pretty much 2 choices. Either go in for the creep kill and get some HP shaved off, or just stand back and not lose HP. He chose the former and pretty much lost his lane. If I was him, I would stay in EXP range until lvl 2 and just farm with razes. 


In my game by the 5th minute I had 23 creep kills and 15 denies while the enemy SF had 3 creep kills and 4 denies, and I had a full level advantage on him plus a kill soon after.

In case you want to see the match for reference, ID: 29253589

If you don't like playing Viper against SF (although I can't imagine why since Viper shuts down SF SO HARD). You can ask for smoke ganks from your teammates, assuming your teammates are competent. I think thats one of the reason why the pros stopped using SF in pro games, cause of the fact that he is squishy + no escape mechanism.

TL;DR last hit better harass harder.","1343779550"

Can you please give me a synopsis of what each is, how it's achieved, why we want it, and how it functions in practicality.

&gt;I am working on it. Forgive me if I'm trying to accelerate too quickly you past a year of the ideology that blinded me for a year. I am just saying you will one day be grateful, just as I am. :P

Maybe, but a blind man who knows not what sight is not blind in his perspective.

&gt;OK, I will stop mentioning them. I would get started, however, and read general philosophy or take a class in college - like Intro to Philosophy (usually Descartes, Socrates, Hume, Kant, Nietzsche...) or Political Philosophy (Rawls). They help A LOT in bringing you back to Earth - because I know for me I was way out there before hand.
It is strange but true for me: there will come a day where you actually support the work of a subreddit like /r/EnoughPaulSpam. I apologized to all of them one day when I realized they were actually doing a good thing.

And in my second semester this year, I'll be taking a philosophy course. Hopefully, I will be able to get my hands on their works.

Also, what's the deal with that subreddit? Paul supporters? People just pissed off at Paul's campaign? What gives?

&gt;Yes, it can. In fact, everything is (and this is the philosophical tradition following Immanuel Kant). Just like Self-Other, we find there is a Subject-Object relationship that functions in a very similar way. Without subjectivity, there can be no objectivity; and vise versa.

Without subjectivity, wouldn't everything be objective? And vice versa?

&gt;There are many possible solutions. I suggest you make a thread in /r/DebateACommunist and ask the Marxists how this gets done. It's actually a good question, depending on how you word it. Listen to and heed what they say, many of them are very wise beyond my years.

"gaymers","t5_2s9n5","Hi, I'd like to reply to this. Let me know if my reply doesn't make sense though. It might be scrambled since I've got a bad headache.

I'm a bisexual woman, which I think puts me somewhere in between heterosexual and lesbian. I'm also heavily mixed, but very lightskinned and I can tell you that things are about the same on this front. Personally, because my skin is light, I get seen as 'exotic' rather than 'ethnic' (at this point, I'd like to say I tended to avoid people who spoke like this) and I ended up highly fetishized for being slightly physically different without being, as I said, 'ethnic'. 

From my experience, sexual racism is not specific to mm relations, but I cannot comment on that with full conviction because I have never been a gay man. From what I've seen, nonwhite gay men tend to be the most open to dating other nonwhite gay men, but rarely date outside their own background (and white men.) 

That being said, it's the same for people in my group. My straight black female friend is less likely to be asked out by white guys than I am, yet she prefers white guys far more than I do. I don't have a racial preference but I have never been approached by a nonwhite person romantically. 

As far as my take on all of it, as much as I disagree, 'white' skin is seen as conventionally attractive, at least in my area. It's similar to how height (tall men / shortish women) and weight / body (built but lean men / thin but curvy women) are seen as conventionally attractive, so there's a cultural tendency to pursue those types. I think it really sucks, but there it is, I guess.

Anyway, I don't know how relevant my opinion is on this matter or in this sub, but I figured I'd give it a shot.","1343779557"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Early in my relationship with my boyfriend, I was still emotionally messed-up from a bad breakup with my ex. At one point, my ex talked me into meeting up with him, and I - stupidly - did so. I told my boyfriend I was going to visit my parents, and instead drove to my ex's college, and hung out with him for a day. We talked, and kissed at one point, but I did not sleep with him. 

When I got back, my boyfriend did not suspect a thing, but I felt so guilty I told him anyway. He was (understandably) furious, but I begged him to forgive me and cut off all ties with my ex. He ended up forgiving me, I worked hard to become a person more deserving of him.

Four years later, we are still together, and have an amazing relationship. My boyfriend is a wonderful person, and I feel like the luckiest person in the world to be with him. 

TL;DR - I fucked up big time, but my SO forgave me and our relationship recovered.","1343779560"

My friends were also worried when I said that I'll be uploading the movies to the internet, but the way I see it, movies are a form of art so colleges aren't likely to call you out for making an edgy or shocking film.

If you look at the images side by side you can see that in the image you posted that the two black cleats near the arch of his right foot are at/above the yellow part of the shoe on the left foot. In the image I posted they are *just* above the yellow. 

Let's work our way down. If you look in the image you posted, you can see the black cleat on the bottom of the right shoe. On the image I posted You can see that it is obviously off the ground and if you look on the left foot there is a small black cleat near the white side/toe area of the shoe. Now back to the larger image, the white of the shoe is clearly visible as well. With a little bit of zooming it is possible to see that same small black cleat.

Lastly, look at the shoe laces on the left shoe in the image I posted. They are both nearly horizontal. In the larger image they are a little harder to see because of the white paint on the field. They are also horizontal and even have a very similar shape to those in the image I posted.

In conclusion, it is my professional opinion, based on the images shown that these two images were taken at the same moment in the play. ","1343779571"

Just because some founding fathers were religious does not deter from the fact that the country was never founded as a christian nation.  These people understood that no matter what they persoannly believed the idea of having a religious group involved in government ment that there would always be one religion raised above others.  At this time in history, the founders saw how badly this idea went for the church of England and swore this would be happen here.  I really don't see how the fact that some of the founders were theists degrades this argument.  If anything the theists also saw this danger and agreed that it could not be a dividing line in the country.  To remove this threat they declared that the church and state to be seperate.  Thus the sole purpose of the government is to govern the people and secular law.  History shows clearly how religions come and go, and these people knew Christianity would not last forever and that to be effetcive government people needed to be free to express thier own beliefs.

You think devs should implement a FOV setting on the horizontal axis but at the same time limit the vertical axis only? This would make triple screens possible as well as limit the FOV in sane way.

Also, a lot of games get triple monitor setups right. Especially ones these days. At that point, the horizontal FOV is just so extreme that fisheye occurs, no aspect ratio troubles there, just FOV. HUD issues are really one of the major things that are wrong with most games on triple monitors, technically most modern games work fine aside from that.

I'm by no means trying to bash tall, skinny, model looking women here, but those are nearly the only types of women who are portrayed as beautiful and desirable by the media. 

And the problem with that is that the vast majority of women are not naturally that skinny, or that tall, but since we are told over and over again that that is beauty so many girls starve themselves to death, quite literally, or just feel ugly and worthless because they can never look like that. It's by no means a healthy image to promote.

Maybe do a little research to see the active ingredients and formulations in the birth control you have now and see if there are any that have a similar formulation since you don't want the unwanted side effects.  Even ask a pharmacist.

Sure it could. Have any other non-Trill character have a former partner who *is* a Trill. All other particulars remain the same. Interspecies romance is so common on Star Trek it'd be hard to list all the hybrids in the Federation.

&gt; I don't think they chose Dax as fan service.

Not my contention at all.

&gt; I don't think it was intended to be fan service.

...yeah, intent doesn't matter to me here. First of all, we can't retroactively read the minds of the producers; second, the insertion of fanservice often happens without stated intent. I'm not saying that this inherently makes it fanservice either; I just find it peculiar the logical leaps to which you seem to be going in order to define it as definitely not fanservice, by some arguments that seem kinda specious. It makes it seem like you feel conflicted about both liking the episode, and acknowledging that the perspective that it might've been exploitative, was somehow valid.

The stigma that Fast&amp;Food is unhealthy, bad, and so on, is an embarrassment of riches, as the food is taken care of for reasonable quality and there's hardly any reason for people to go hungry.

The Doom Preps can then waste a good chunk of their lives fooling around, firing their ammo training for the worst, heck wasting money on weaponry rather than on food and on better conditions...

The trouble is that resources are actually finite. Life goes by quick. The kids of the Doom Preps might soon grow old and have to deal with life for real and then the missed education opportunities and so on might make them less able to compete in these modern societies. Would any of those kids have learned a second language? Would they be looking into doing their Masters after school? Heck, would they be ready for sports of some kind?

The warhound has better defined legs, and the weapons/arms are more distinct from the central body compared to the goliath. And the missiles being launched off look good, having a slow curved launch initially, then speeds very quickly to the target.

But I don't care for that shield like thing on the warhound, and I don't care for the laser like attack it uses.

"casualiama","t5_2sxwp","This will be a long response. I have a lot of reasons for making this choice:

The biggest factor of starting my own business is that I'm going to be doing a lot of travelling over the next few years, and there is no way I'll be able to hold down a normal 9 - 5 job. With this, I can generally manage things while I'm on the road. The fact that I'll be travelling could even open up new markets to me.

I've had a few experiences with jobs that pushed me towards it, both positive and negative. I got laid off by one company, and I worked as a delivery driver for a while (had a terrible store.) Those experiences made me want to do everything I could to not work for large corporations again. It instilled the idea that I could maybe do things better one day.

I also happened to work for a local screen printing company doing graphic design. They started off working out of their house and are now a multi-million dollar company. It was pretty inspirational to work for them. I got to see an up close and personal perspective about what all it takes to be an entrepreneur. I really learned the value of how local businesses effect and support the community around them. It just feels right to me.
I've also had this overwhelming desire to help those around me. I eventually want to start a non-profit later on in life. For now, a business seems like the best way I can help others while still maintaining my own needs. 

The market thing is still iffy for me. There are billions of photographers and artists out there who do what I do, so it will definitely be an uphill battle. I'm hoping that my personal way of working with people and organizing will be a driving factor for my clients and customers. My main market for photography is going to be doing work for other businesses. I've found that they're usually willing to pay for quality work, and normally won't go with someone with poor quality just because they're cheaper. If they do go with someone else, I can rest assured that it's because they're genuinely better in some way. I'm also aiming to build an image for my company (and myself), that appeals directly to ""alternative"" individuals. So, We'll see if that works. :]

The retail aspect of my business, is really out of a love for making books. There's just something about making a book and holding handmade books in my hands, that is amazing. I'm hoping others out there love it as much as I do. :]

"running","t5_2qlit","Have you considered that this may not have anything to do with motivation? Not enough information up above to figure this out, so take it for what it's worth... 

Sounds like you where pushing through exhaustion. There's a time and place for that, but, if this is your first marathon, it may not be the right time. 

I am not the right person to analyze your training plan, but, if you post your background, PR times, and training plan, more experienced runners/coaches can provide you with better feedback.

If this is your first marathon, here's what I think might be happening (for all that's worth). You are running too fast too early in your training. I am not an experienced runner, but I've done some personal research on the topic. I'm a fan of the Lydiard method of long distance training. It relies on building a strong base of long miles while keeping your running at the high range of your aerobic ability. If you don't have that base then you might be pushing into anaerobic running too soon.

Just something to consider.

At any rate.... Don't beat yourself up over this. Running is a lifelong endeavor, and one day or one week or one month is not going to make a difference. Keep it up, and try not to get discouraged.

If there is a combination of either of these plus being a monopoly, monopsony, oligarchy, etc. then the answer isn't as straightforward.

They thought Colin Farrell was Scottish, and that scotland was a part of Ireland (dafuq?), one of them was ""*so excited to use her british pounds in ireland*"" They worried about the ""language barrier"" bacause they couldn't speak ""Gaaaaylick"", and they wondered what they'd drink because they didn't like guinness, and wondered if they could buy bottled water over here. They also thought Yeats, Wilde and so on were English. 

Luckily I managed to stike up a conversation with a lovely irish lad across the Isle seat from me, and we managed to drop into every sentence a hint that we were irish, and how the euro is screwing our economy, and how the English were lucky to still have their pound over in england.

"bjj","t5_2qn02","From my understanding the philosophical difference is that 10th planet is more transitional in its attacks, the question they ask with their training is ""what is the next move in the chain if this one isn't working?"", and they put value in submissions that are different/obscure/unorthadox because it can be easier to catch someone out with a submission they are unaware of.

Gracie Jiu Jitsu places a higher value in gaining and maintaining positional dominance, and the question they ask with they training is more likely to be "" what am i missing/what do i need to do to make this move tighter, more effective or more difficult to escape?"" in this instance you are less likely to be caught out by something you don't know, but are far more likely (if you've rolled with your partner before) to know exactly what he intends to submit you with, but still might not be able to stop him. 

10th planet Jiu Jitsu gets far more flak, but this may be because of the silly names used for techniques ( which is actual a great memory trick) and also because coaches of non 10th planet clubs are sick of newbs asking to learn the twister or some other gimmick on their 1st session which they have heard/seen on the internet.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I agree with much of what you said, you are very correct that relationships are more complex, as is attraction and friendship - perhaps in my case there were a host of other facts that explained my success for a overweight and average looking guy.

I was (and am) tall (6 foot 2), and while I was overweight I also carried a fair but of muscle (played a lot of rugby) I was a bass player in a band, I was fairly popular amongst my male peers and generally confident. I could handle a drink and was a friendly drunk, my social crowed tended to be of the rock/indie/band groups in one of several rock clubs where I loved. I lived in a city with a popular art school that had a fairly large attendance of intelligent artistic (and often stunning looking) girls - and although I'm not an artist (though my graphic design, CAD and 3d rending skills are decent enough) I did enjoy talking about art.

All these things might have contributed to my success with women, and these may not be things which apply to anyone reading my advice - which is why I stayed away fro claiming it was ""get girls"" advice, and simply general good advice for starting a conversation with anyone.

So yes, YMMV is true as always.","1343779626"

You didn't witness or participated in slavery, nor the holocaust, so I don't see why that's relevant.  This however, you did witness, you had evidence, and you quite simply, chose to protect a predator because he was your friend.  Yes, you told the woman, but it was obvious that you didn't like her and she would likely have felt the same about you, thus making your warning easier to brush off.   You could have taken it to someone who WOULD listen, but you brushed off any further responsibility since you felt that it was now off your chest, even though your message didn't get all the way through.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Like you said, I'm not entirely sure if he's truly OP, but laning against him top solo early on is a fucking nightmare.

He can trade with you with seemingly no penalty. He bursts you for 50% of your health on anyone other than Malphite with a dorans shield, and then immediately stomps you on CS. You get closer again to get a little cs, and your chunked for another 40-50%, or just chunked + ignited and your dead. He then immediately comes back with more gear, and does it again.

You are either giving him free CS, free kills or permission to roam the map and destroy every other lane. I have not come across a single Xin since the remake that didn't go at least 9/1 at some point of the game. Luckily he falls off later if he's building pure damage (which many are right now) so it balances back out, but he can do irreparable damage.

He's like facing a Wukong when you don't know how to deal with Wukong, but there doesn't seem to be a clear way to deal with Xin. You have to play ridiculously passive and pray your jungle is strong, or you are just losing lane.","1343779628"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","Agreed to both points.  In fact, if you look at some of the option stuff from Martinez that they've been doing from the gun, it all has roots in the late 90's option game.

Regarding pro players from NU, you're absolutely right.  For years they sent OL, RB, and all kinds of defensive players (the Blackshirts were the real deal).  But the negative recruiting doesn't need to make sense, it just needs to damage the school in question.  Most HS kids aren't going to look up the numbers of NFL prospects from NU and what position they played, etc, they're just going to hear a coach dogging the school that they showed interest in and then they'll question what they know vs what he knows.

"funny","t5_2qh33","The retirement community my parents moved into is several small neighborhoods in a gated community in Florida.  You have to be a minimum age to own a home or live in the community.  So if I inherited the house tomorrow, I'd have to sell it rather than live in it.  Inside the community, there is are tennis courts, pools, small lakes, a club house for socializing, exercise rooms, etc.  The community takes care of all of the landscaping and outdoor upkeep.  My parents did scale back from a large house to a much smaller one.  They were having some health issues so they needed a place with milder weather and less strenuous physical activity, like yard work or shoveling snow.

We moved several times when I was a kid so we never lived near family or had classmates we had known for several years.  I saw my grandparents once every couple of years; my aunts, uncles, and cousins every five to ten years.  I haven't lived in the same state as any family member in over ten years.  So I don't have any childhood friendships.  I'm also adopted so I don't know any of my blood relatives either.  For some of us, community is what you make of it.","1343779628"

"pics","t5_2qh0u","My Dad high sided on his Harley. he slid about 200 ft and landed in some bushes. He was wearing a helmet, leather chaps, boots, and a Kevlar jacket (his ""summer"" jacket). He had 2 raspberries on his skin one on his knee, one on his shoulder both about the side of a silver dollar. (raspberry is where the skin is pealed off to the point of bleeding, see road rash) He had a broken/dislocated rib and a bruise that went all up one side of his body from about the rib to the middle of his thigh.

None of his gear was fully compromised. I say fully because the jacket's first layer was ripped at a seam exposing the second later. The chaps had some scratches but fully intact. His helmet (3/4 face) had scratches all up one side of some scratches through the plastic shell.

The little road rash he had the doctors said it was from the friction of the road grinding on the material.

Think about that; The heat from sliding on the pavement caused the material to heat up so much that it burned his skin. Now think about if there was nothing there. Rub your hands on some pavement and feel how it grips your skin it is like 1 grit sand paper. Within a matter of milliseconds with no protection you are looking at losing your skin. After that you are grinding away muscle and eventually down to bone. If it is your skull sliding on the pavement. if your head manages to not be cracked open upon impact you would quickly lose the skin and then have it grinding on your skull.

Depending on the crash he could survive wearing that little. However I care to guess that the damage would be so severe that he would require so much fixing or would die in the hospital. Wearing full gear he would take the odds and flip them (as it stands he is more likely to die, with gear he would be more likely to survive)

With seeing what happened to my dad; along with the hospital bill (5 years of accident free riding before he wrecked; 50,000 dollars in medical bills about 90% of which was covered by his insurance) I will always wear all my gear. If it is too hot to wear all my gear I will take my car.

TL;DR You don't need a bomb suit but a little bit of gear goes a long way.","1343779638"

"politics","t5_2cneq","anyways just want to publicly apologize for the ad hominems. I am just sick of the culture of hero worship surrounding soldiers, as well as the euphemistic language being used to more or less brainwash less intelligent members of the public.

My issue with calling the weapon in question a riot gun versus a grenade launcher (or even gas grenade launcher as a compromise) is manifold. First and most obviously riot gun implies that any time it is being used there is a riot. 

Police have riot guns? there must be a riot. It just plants this idea in peoples heads right away, and automatically places the police in a defensive position, because hey rioters! even if these ""rioters"" are peaceful protesters. Secondly, it is less descriptive - in keeping with george orwells ideas of newspeak, it seeks to strip the identity from the word describing the object. 

Think about it

Riot Gun = something that shoots riots? what sense does this make? It is clearly not a gun. Riot cannon or riot mortar maybe, but no guns shoot 38mm rounds. This is a clear misnomer, intentionally used to make the weapon sound less menacing. Gun sounds better than mortar, cannon or launcher because hey civilians can own guns - the word is more familiar, and as such less apt to draw criticism or attention. 

Compare this to Grenade Launcher

Does it launch grenades? yes

Even if it only shoots CS grenades, these are still grenades. The term is clearly more accurate","1343779640"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","&gt;*For example, Adam and Eve. If that isn't literally true, that puts a huge dent in the concept of original sin.*

This is a strawman, the story of adam and eve has been interpreted allegorically since before Christianity existed, but within the christian tradition let me quote Origen writing in the 3rd century:

&gt;&gt;He composed a texture of both kinds in one style of narration, always concealing the hidden meaning more deeply; but where the historical narrative could not be made appropriate to the spiritual coherence of the occur­rences, He inserted sometimes certain things which either did not take place or could not take place; sometimes also what might happen, but what did not:  and He does this at one time in a few words, which, taken in their “bodily” meaning, seem inca­pable of containing truth, and at another by the in­sertion of many.  And this we find frequently to be the case in the legislative portions, where there are many things manifestly useful among the “bodily” precepts, but a very great number also in which no principle of utility is at all discernible, and some­times even things which are judged to be impossi­bilities.  Now all this, as we have remarked, was done by the Holy Spirit in order that, seeing those events which lie on the surface can be neither true nor useful, we may be led to the investigation of that truth which is more deeply concealed, and to the ascertaining of a meaning worthy of God in those Scriptures which we believe to be inspired by Him.

Original sin works just fine as an allegory for the human condition of separation from god with Adam and Eve as a personification of this principle.

&gt;*If the jews didn't escape the egyptians and if Moses wasn't on Mt. Sinai then God didn't give him the 10 commandments.*

This is only a problem to Orthodox Jews, so if you want to discuss the actuality of the event go find Namer and have him explain his cloud theory or whatever. For Christians the spiritual truth of the story is what is important not the actuality. We can learn many things from this story about God's relationship to the Israelites and as an extension his relationship to us through this story... that is what is important about it.

&gt;*I gave examples of what IS in the bible, but you said those things mean something contrary to what they say.*

I don't hold a biblicist position, it doesn't bother me that you read something in the text that I don't, I don't hold that the text is totally accessible to any rational reader with no background in history, theology, and ancient languages and working from translations. Furthermore, I have given you my understanding of all the passages you have suggested, I am happy to further explain my positions, but your response of: well I'm just reading what is written, is not a very good one as what is written in English as interpreted in the 21st century isn't always the greatest yardstick for what the text actually means. Furthermore I would maintain that there isn't necessarily a single objectively correct interpretation for everyone, rather much of the purpose of the bible is its roll as a subjective text speaking into the immediate circumstances of the reader.

&gt; *YOU changed what they did/meant to suit your own morality!*

From where I'm sitting it looks like you are distorting the text to suit your own polemical position. It strikes me that there is a strong emancipatory message within the text that should be understood in the scenarios of slavery and injustice. Furthermore, Jesus gives explicit principles by which to understand his moral teachings, this principle is reiterated by all the major commentators in the NT. My interpretation squares with this principle and with the broader message of the text, yours simply isolates a few passages and reads them as literally as possible in Modern English. So I am confused why I am being accused of misrepresentation.

&gt;*Do you even know the bible? It doesn't say that much about hell but it does say it's eternal (rev 14:11) and final (heb 9:27). No it's not physical, but much worse, it's spiritual or conscious torture.*

Certainly I know the bible, and certainly I am aware of the ""eternal fire."" But I am reading the text in full, not simply stopping where it suits me. Likewise I recognize my epistemic limits when it comes to this subject and refrain from taking a hard stance on the matter beyond a few clear principles. 

But just to deal with your two examples:

As for Revelations, well I'm entirely happy to read it for what it is, apocalyptic literature. Really I see no reason to read this as a literal statement of what hell will be like. For the same reason I don't think there will be a literal 10 horned beast a la Daniel 7 and Revelation 13.

As for Hebrews, it only states that there will be a final judgement... It doesn't give any indication of what happens in between death and judgement, when or how that judgement happens, who gives the judgement... simply that it will happen. I agree and it is entirely consistent with what I had previously said.

I think the verses you were looking for were in Matthew 8:12:

&gt; “But the subjects of the kingdom will be thrown outside, into the darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”

But this makes no mention of the fire that is elsewhere... suggesting that neither is a literal description of hell, but that both are allegorical. This severely limits what we can say about the actual nature of hell, besides the themes of the allegory, namely, separation, punishment, and destruction.

aslo Mark 9:48:

&gt; And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell, where
&gt;“‘the worms that eat them do not die,
    and the fire is not quenched.’

But this is again not a literal description, but rather a quotation from Isaiah 66:24 where he is speaking about the final judgement, again in highly poetic and allegorical terms. 

Fundamentally this is the problem with hell, no one ever speaks directly about its nature, but always through stories, poems, allegories, and so on. As such there are many conclusions one can draw as to its nature. As it happens, we live in the shadow of the late medieval tradition of Hell whereby Dante and Milton inform most of our Christian eschatology and we understand these texts through that lens.

&gt;*God still doesn't exist and the case for it gets weaker every time I talk to a theist.*

In honestly I'm not trying to convince you of such. If I was trying to convert people there would be much more useful things for me to be doing than having arguments on the internet ;).

"AskSocialScience","t5_2sml9","I don't have any sources to back this up, but as someone who used to smoke pot quite frequently and knew a lot of people in the ""industry"": 

Let's look in the places where weed is... ""75% legal."" Meaning, states like Colorado, California, where you basically just need an easy to obtain doctor's signature, or in the Netherlands where it's not officially legal but the authorities just look the other way. 

Weed is *pretty much* the same price in those places as it is on the streets of a big city (at least in the US). Approximately $30-60 an eighth, or ~$300-400 for an ounce. It's not really going to be a question of price, but rather quality. Obviously you can get much more potent weed in places where it's quasi-legal. 

If you're selling weed *legally,* there are a lot of additional costs you have to factor in: greater overhead costs (if you run a dispensary), state and local (and in the future, possible federal) taxes, and a higher level of regulatory compliance. 

Conversely, if you're not selling weed legally, you have to deal with much greater financial risks in case of busts. But you're also free from regulations that go hand in hand with legalization. 

I don't buy the argument that if weed were legal, prices would plummet. Overall, I think they could be less, but it just depends on how much it would be taxed. 

TL;DR: Price would probably stay around the same; quality would probably go up. ","1343779643"

2. I am blown away by Waze - this is what crowd sourcing could be. iOS and Android.

3. TWiT has been profitable since day one. First with donations from listeners, more recently with advertising. We grossed $3.75 million last year, should break $4 million this year. Currently I'm putting most of that back into the network. (EDIT: I checked with Lisa today and it's more like $4.25 million last year. She's aiming at $6 mill this year. We grossed $447K this month, up 47% over last July, so maybe she'll do it!)

4. Like any network we will cancel shows that don't interest the audience and replace them with shows that (we hope) do. I hate canceling shows (I am talent after all) but it's the only way we can be profitable. I don't want to do shows people don't want to watch.

He went on to explain that we went through the same things, albeit to a lesser degree, so he started doing all sorts of cardio to replace the running and lessen the impact.  His routine now is to run two days a week, bike two days, and get on the elliptical two days.  He says on the days he doesn't run he simply does the other exercise for as long as it would take him to run however far his training plan calls for on that given day.  

Of course I'll do other cardio when I'm recovering but I don't see myself ever moving to a system like this until I get older; getting on an elliptical for an hour and a half sounds like torture compared to going on a 10 mile run outside.","1343779649"

Kim Kold is actually a really nice guy. quick story: when i first saw this a couple of years ago, just for shits and giggles, i added Kim Kold on FB. i didn't know if it was his personal page, a PR page or a fan page. every now and then i'd see him signed on to chat but i never said anything because what would i say? anyway, ages later, a friend of mine was in a really bad place in his life. we'll call him D. D isn't the easiest person in the world to get along with. his social skills were limited, at best and he's really angry in general. his own dad suspects him of being autistic in some way. personality-wise, he's very similar to Dennis, only really pissed off, somewhat violent and not nearly as cuddly. D is a body builder who dreamt of going amateur and then pro. his dreams were crushed when he was lifting and horribly tore a muscle in his arm. this required multiple surgeries to repair and no gym for D, which was really his only outlet. on top of that, a few weeks after the injury, D's mom died. drank herself to death, basically. D was miserable. really really depressed. so one morning, before work, i noticed that Kim Kold was signed into chat. so i im'd him just on the off chance it was really him. i explained that i really know nothing about body building but was a huge fan of Dennis, told him D's story and linked him to D's fb page and said it would be really cool if he could maybe give D some words of encouragement. i figured it would brighten his day a bit. no response, so i signed off and went to work. get home from work and sure as shit, there's a response from Kim Kold saying that he sent D a message, thanked me for my service (i'm in the military) and thanks for being a fan. i thought that was really cool and promptly forgot about it. a couple of days later, D's brother called me and asked me wtf i did. i had no idea what he was talking about so he told me D's been roaming around bragging about his new best buddy - Kim Kold, the world class body builder. D's  brother knows me well and knows the shit i can get up to. turns out that Kim Kold not only sent him a message but actually opened a real dialogue w/ D, passed on really helpful advice about how to recover from his injury, words of encouragement, etc. D was totally over the moon. i never told D what i did, neither did his brother and neither did Kim Kold. D got out of his rut after a while, recovered from his injury and is now back in the gym, angry as ever. 
tl;dr - Kim Kold is a fucking awesome human being and deserves reddit's wholehearted support. ","1343779650"

For instance the first few days are tough, then maybe you're good for a couple weeks then BAM--outta the wild comes a craving at 3-4 weeks.  You stare those down and BAM -- another wild craving leaps out of the brush at the 3 month mark.  

Bottom line, you should understand that we are addicts.  We will never be *fully* rid of the nicotine imp...he will tap you on the shoulder once in a while...nothing to be bothered by, but something to be prepared for!

Also, the further along in you quit you go, the easier it is to justify 'just one'.  Or else you simply forget how much it sucked to quit the first time.  Or else you lose sight of the reasons why you quit... **do this:**

1. Make a list of the reasons you quit.  Be VERY detailed and specific.  Keep this with you for 6 months.  

2.  Don't light up another cig unless you are willing to return to your previous rate of consumption.  Within a day or two (or hours) you will be smoking as much as ever.  

If you are serious about quitting...spend some time educating yourself about what is involved.  *The more you educate yourself, the higher your odds at success!!* Two resources often recommended include whyquit.com and Alan Carr's book are both excellent resources to challenge the way you view nicotine.

Also, politics and money will find their way back into society, as power and greed are just part of humanity. That is unavoidable. So if the goal is a utopia, the plan is probably destined to fail, anyway. That honestly makes it seem even less desirable.","1343779659"
"Music","t5_2qh1u","On paper, this would be the ideal scenario if all things were equal, but what people forget is the reason things sort-of worked in the past, wasn't because musicians just put up with the record company greed, is was because in exchange for their cut they took care of business, while the musicians took care of the music.  

Most musicians don't want to be captains of industry, that's not why they learned to play the guitar, or wanted to write songs.  The missing piece of the puzzle is about editorial.  

If someone likes your music that's great, but they probably didn't check you out in the first place by randomly searching the internet.  They were directed towards you by other factors.  Maybe you have nice teeth and happened to strike just the right pose at the halfway mark on your YouTube clip, so the thumbnail appealed to the right demographic, or you've got an eye for fashion and know how to ""be hip"".  

This overly romanticised notion that all we have to do to get back to the garden of eden, is do away with everything but the music — you know, just like it used to be — is complete horse shit.  Do you think Joni Mitchell was blind to the fact she was a pretty young blond?  Do you think Frank Zappa wasn't all too painfully aware of the fact he didn't sell as many copies as the fucking Monkeys?

The difference with music made back in the days when all the listener had to look at was the gatefold sleeve and the vinyl spinning round, isn't that it was free from commercial pressures, it's that it was made by people with vision, talent and absolute dedication.  These days every 15 year old with a few hundred Facebook likes thinks they're owed fame and fortune, just because they have a nice haircut and a girlfriend who once made a sex tape with that guy with tourettes on some reality show.

But even worse than that, this all serves to lead the music journalists and opinion formers in that direction too.  When was the last time you saw a talented guitarist on TV, just because he was a talented guitarist?  When was the last time you saw an actual musician playing an actual instrument in a music video?  

500 channels of ""Ow my balls"" and not a single solitarily gap in the schedule for music lessons, or pro-tips on how to record music properly in a budget home studio.  

Yes, there are myriad reasons why the utopian ideals of this cartoon are not being realised and yes the giant corporations are largely to blame.  But this fanciful idea that if they were to just vanish overnight, people would start paying musicians again, is utter claptrap.  Music isn't a product, it's a service.  It should be a privilege to play music for people, not an expectation that it will automatically lead to being paid as well.","1343779659"

So my Dad owns a contracting business and along with it a lot of expensive tools and equipment.

Anyways, a couple days later, my mother in law tells me that someone called from a number with my dad's shop name looking for a taxi. This was a common occurance for them to get taxi calls since my inlaws number was one digit off from the cab company. It clicked in my head and holy shit, this moron called a cab as his getaway after breaking and entering and stealing from my dad's shop. What kind of bad luck can a criminal have to call the boyfriends parent's of the daughter of the man they just ripped off? So, my old man calls the cab company and gets them to go over their records for a call at such and such time. He gets an address, and presto chango, we've got an arrest.

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","You cannot possibly deny that the social concept of race is a thing! It is inarguable that there is a history within the US and abroad that the social construct of race exists and that people's lives are different based on the fact that other people will react to a black person different than a white person based solely on the knowledge that one is black and one is white. This is a fact and that fact does not go away just by you saying that we shouldn't acknowledge skin color. What you're arguing for is commonly called the colorblind theory and studies have shown that teachers who ascribe to it in classrooms when dealing with children of different ethnicities are actually more prejudiced than teachers who do not use this attitude because people who say they don't see race are **only** saying they don't see race because **race is built into the very foundation of our society**. You can't just take the attitude of ""well if I just say race doesn't exist, then it no longer exists right!"" because the historical damage of saying that race does exist has already been done and, now for what seems like the thousandth time, just taking back that attitude **doesn't just make the very real emotional, social, monetary, esteem, etc damage go away**. Hundreds of years of racism and prejudices have lead to a society with the two deeply entrenched within it and have literally manifested it as an unavoidable aspect of social life, either by determining how other people react to you, as a black person (for example, crossing the street when a black man is walking behind you, which, if you were a black male and it happened a hundred times to you, would have a huge impact on your esteem, confidence, comfort, etc.) or by determining **what you can ignore**, as a white person (people are less likely to cross the street if a white male is walking behind them, thus it's easy to say as a white male that the esteem issues caused in the black man are not correct or real). All of these outcomes are real. How do you expect those people to be able to say ""Hey, white people doing this to me, like always crossing the street because they think I'm a thug, makes me unjustly feel like a criminal and like shit and makes me feel like I can't be anything more than a thug"" when you are literally telling them ""The thing that is responsible for the way you've been treated your whole life doesn't exist and thus your reactions to them are invalid."" You can't get over things by ignoring them. I'm saying we have to acknowledge that race exist instead of simply superceding the past several hundred years of our society and just saying ""jk."" You're not moving past anything by simply invalidating it; you're just shutting down any conversation that can lead to social and emotional growth in the subject. ","1343779665"

"sports","t5_2qgzy","The full text of the Facebook post for the lazy:

&gt;To Rodney Erickson, and the rest of the Penn State Nation, I hope that this status goes viral so you will someday read it. I am a Wounded Warrior, wounded in combat by a gunshot wound through my pelvis. I have never asked, or tried to hide my scars or have them removed. Why? Because they are reminders of who I am and what I've done. All those things I've done may not have been good, but I am man enough to accept and face that. You should be man enough to face your past. We do not remove the Lincoln Memorial because he started the Civil War, rather we leave it as a reminder of the good he's done. To some, the statute may remind them of the Sandusky Child Molestations, and I understand that. However, how are you to move forward in this life if you do not know where you've been? We study history to remind us to not allow it to repeat itself. Some have said that no man, coach, or player is bigger than the school. I disagree, because all the administration has done is prove that Joe Paterno was Penn State. Joe Pa lived for the school, and had the backbone to stare adversity in the eyes, and was able to put blinders on to ignore what the media and speculators said, to do what was needed. Even until the day he passed away, Coach Paterno lived with gracious integrity and still to this day, has been the only staff member to admit he was wrong. And if this status goes viral, all I ask is that the school be punished through a conventional process, not the court of public opinion. I also ask that ESPN give a sincere and public apology for dragging the school, Joe Pa, the victims, and the fans, alumni, and families of Penn State through the dirt by giving an unfair and completely biased, opinionated report. Much like my scars will always make me who I am, Joe Paterno will forever be Penn State.

IMO, there are a lot of sentences in there that, in isolation, are crazy (which of course is why Deadspin wrote an article on it in the first place; because they are the kings of cherry picking).

But the sentiment isn't bad.  The university's history is forever intertwined with Joe Paterno; no amount of whitewashing or discrediting will ever change that.  The Board of Trustees just wants to turn the page and move on, but it's not going to happen, because you can't spend a half-century building someone up as the public face of the university and then go ""oh, nevermind"" at the end of it.","1343779670"

 Recently I watched this great documentary called Jiro Dreams of Sushi (which everyone should watch, it's really enjoyable, and pleasing to watch). Jiro is the world's best sushi chef, and at 85 years old he still strives to improve and attain perfection in his craft. In the film he says ""if your sense of taste is lower than that of your customers, how will you impress them?"" He also mentions how he is envious of Joel Robuchon's (highly renowned French chef) sense of smell and taste, saying if only he had his nose and tongue, he could make even better food! This is one of the best chefs in the world saying this, mind you. 

It's quite evident that chefs value these senses very highly, it allows for them to critique their own flavours better, and improve on things better as a result. ","1343779674"

The answer is yes and no.

There's a limit to how much it'll help and that limit isn't very high.  It varies with the person too.  If I remember right, a few people got ""It helped but you can barely tell and it's definitely not worth it"" to ""yeah, my beard did get fuller.""  No one got anything impressive out of it though.

Rogaine is also not a ""one use and it's good forever"".  The effects apparently fade if you stop using it.  Also I do believe some people say it dries their skin out and is troublesome to apply.  And remember, it's not cheap.

A) People annoyed no one has been arrested.

"funny","t5_2qh33","[Determine what your BMI is.](http://www.nhlbisupport.com/bmi/) The site tells you the healthy, under/overweight and obese levels. But really, it's a bit different for everyone.

Personally, I think the Victoria's secret models are underweight. If they are not, they have body types that are not usually common. The Dove women do not look obese to me in the slightest. If anything, some are a bit overweight, but mostly, they all look very healthy. They are curvy, but don't seem to have excess ""flab"" on their underarms or stomachs, which is pretty common to see if someone is truly overweight or obese.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","You are right that simply having the shit-testing done to us isn't firm enough ground to necessarily be upset past the point of being annoyed. However, in relation to the direction I believed the thread was going, being shamed, emasculated, dehumanized, etc., over failing it, which seems to us men as minuscule in importance at best, is what drives us to find such bitterness in the nature. It's like being asked to give a brief oral synopsis of the events of Othello, and if you're wrong or just simply don't know, you get your car towed and your name listed in the newspaper. And on the off chance you're right or lucky, then nothing happens and all is normal. It's a rather ridiculous endeavor from most men's experiences. 

As far as pushing legislation for this, I thought they were just over exaggerating their disapproval of shit-testing; I highly doubt they seriously believed there should be a law against it. I think they were more leaning towards the idea that it should be socially removed as an acceptable action. But, as someone had mention later (I think it was you actually), that the shit-testing is more instinctual than anything, women can't control it. But the humility and disrespect that often comes from failing it is what men want to do away with. This is what I was getting from the discussion. 

Also, I respect, and somewhat agree with your argument that it's just a part of dating and life that guys are going to just have to get used to. But it think that men are getting the feeling that it's being taken too far how women will treat someone that they feel is inferior, and that it's even becoming socially acceptable for them to do so.

Are you saying that God should have created man to be automatrons that are programmed to be always good and please? 
Accept that you are possibly unable to completely understand God and so am I and everyone else. So I seek greater understanding of God.
I believe in a God as father. Like a father who loves his children, he does not control them yet disciplines them as a father. And He wants us to love him in return. Can you or would you control every action that your own child makes even if you could? No. Of course not. Since most agnostics do not believe in a spiritual realm, they believe that death on earth is the end. But most that believe in God believe in life eternal in a spiritual form.

There is a certain body language that accompanies this type of aggression. Usually it comes as a bit standoffish, you can tell they haven't interacted with many foreigners in their time, then they try to sneak it in on the side. The last time it happened to me I was away grabbing a drink and this guy had joined the table while I was gone, came back and all the girls were like ""oooOOo you're a player huh? That's what this guy said."" It was not an act of friendliness. The guy could have made friends with me, I wouldn't have minded if he went for any of the four chicks we were chatting with, but instead he acted like a little cunt.

I've had guys that don't know me walk up to me clubs while I was chatting with chicks and say ""Oh hey, I met this guy earlier, he said he was a player."" I've had guys (who don't know me) try to pull girls away from me and tell them that I'm a player.

I've been shit tested with this at least 4-500 times in the last eight years. Every coworker I have has said to me at one point ""man, I bet your good with the ladies."" in some form or other, this doesn't bother me as much of course.

Asian guys think white guys have magic dicks. White guys think black guys have magic dicks. Black guys don't give a shit.

Japanese guys know that the women here have playeritis, and they use it to their advantage when they can.

Edit: Oh and yeah, when a girl accusses you of this, it's slightly different, and not really aggressive, but in the context it's definitely racist. Like I said before, you realize it's racist when it happens to you every, single, time. The reason it becomes so obviously racist is hard to describe, but basically it's because at this point in the conversation I've done nothing to warrant the title of player. Walking up to someone and introducing yourself is hardly the smoothest thing you can do. Yet within minutes of doing nothing more than conversing a random guy decides to amp up the psycological warfare with this type of stuff. It's racist, as racist as it gets.","1343779694"

Floors

When choosing flooring, stay away from wall-to-wall carpeting which traps allergens such as dust mite allergen, pollen, and pet dander. Bare floors like hardwood, laminate, tile, slate, linoleum or vinyl are better choices for allergy sufferers, because they can be thoroughly washed. There are no places for allergens to hide!

When installing hardwood flooring, be aware that certain finishes can trigger chemical sensitivities as well as asthma and allergies. Many stains, varnishes and sealants are quite toxic and their fumes can linger long after they have been applied to the flooring. Breathing these fumes is not healthy for anyone, allergy sufferer or not. Choose pre-finished hardwood floors or use low VOC products if they must be used. Do not remain in the house while these products are being applied, and don't return until the odor is gone. Ventilate thoroughly and use an air purifier fitted with carbon filtration to help adsorb any remaining VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds).

    char first_row[9] = 0; 
    // Alternately 
    char first_row[9] = '\0';

This means you'll need to increase the size of the arrays by one to account for the null character and explicitly null terminate them as I did above.

The reason it's printing progressively longer strings is an artifact of how local arrays are arranged in memory.  `printf` is coded to continue reading and printing characters from memory until it encounters the `'\0'` character, which it does, only by accident mind you, after the first_row array.

A rough, probably not useful at all, drawing:

Really? You're splitting hairs here, and the fact that you won't even acknowledge that primary evidence for the existence of Jesus (keep in mind, I haven't mentioned anything about his divinity or not) tells me this conversation can't go much further. 

Finally, the NPR link you sent me, in which Bart Ehrman mentions discrepancies of the Gospels, does nothing to demonstrate that Jesus did not exist, only that the authors saw him from different perspectives, from different people. Just as a liberal and a conservative might write *extremely* different articles on Bill Clinton as a President, no one doubts their contradictions lead to questioning the existence of Pres. Clinton as a person. Or if you'd like a more appropriate example, I'm sure not all of the accounts mentioning Caesar saw him as a god as many others did, and only as a ruthless conqueror and usurper. I don't hear any questions about his existence either.

If you're unaware, the last link you sent me contains a link at the very top which leads to a page addressing the concerns of the original author point by point, claims that were disproven.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Nice try. However, notice that my response was on the basis of common law

Which would be awesome, if there were a common law criminal claim for fraud...  Which there isn't.  Good shot, though.  I mean, lots of people might actually be cowed by that kind of distinction.

&gt;I could say that there was fraud based on there being a misrepresentation (the evidence on this thread is enough alone) upon which people relied to their detriment

Which doesn't prove criminal fraud.  You're thinking of a *civil* claim.  Again, good try.  Lots of people also don't know that criminal fraud and civil promissory estoppel aren't the same thing.

&gt;However, you seem to want to find something to quibble about based on what I perceive to be your dislike of my tone.

I could not care less about your tone.  You are making incorrect statements about the law, and speaking as someone who actually *knows* what the elements of criminal fraud are, it irks me.

&gt;he's preoccupied himself with institutional stability and preservation above all else.

You seem to misunderstand ""it would be a violation of a very explicit part of the Constitution to retroactively apply new law"" for some kind of silliness about whether someone supports a new law existing.

&gt;That's because the law, as it exists, preserves institutions before all else.

So, you're saying that the law is wrong, but you object to Obama's actions because he failed to enforce the law?

"AskACountry","t5_2tphg","He didn't ""kill"" our space exploration program. The Space Shuttle was a bad idea from the start. Elements of the government and military insisted on certain design elements that made the shuttle too heavy, thereby limiting cargo capacity and making every launch that much more expensive. The design of the vehicle necessitated the use of sophisticated heat shielding (i.e., the tiles) that would prove to be prone to problems. In other words, the shuttle was over-engineered and over-designed.

Anyway, the decision to retire the shuttle fleet was set in motion years before Obama took office. All he did was drop the hammer.

BIG deal? No, not really. Manned space exploration is awesomely exciting but it is not cost effective. Scrapping the shuttle will allow for more robotic exploration throughout the solar system, meaning more missions for the same amount of money. Besides, why should NASA waste its resources acting as a taxi to the science lab in the sky? Let the Russians handle that (building international relations at the same time) until the private space industry is mature enough.

I've always been very excited about space exploration, and yeah it kind of sucks that we don't have a launch vehicle of our own right now, but a replacement is in the works.","1343779706"

&gt;At the Jerusalem fundraiser, Romney offered additional ammunition for his critics when he pointed out the general good health of the Israeli people and their ability to keep medical costs down. Noting that healthcare spending in Israel is 8% of GDP compared with 18% in the U.S., he said, ""We have to find ways, not just to provide healthcare to more people, but to find ways to find and manage our healthcare costs.""

&gt;Israel, however, has a national healthcare system, with some similarities to the President Obama-backed U.S. healthcare plan Romney has vowed to repeal. (The Obama plan was based on the Massachusetts plan Romney approved as governor.)

I think it has to do with our early human male ancestors being attracted to healthy, fit females as they would make the best mates and thus keep our species alive (and vice versa). I believe that those ideas have been ingrained into our personalities. Females, to attract a husband, want to look attractive, and males, when finding a healthy wife, want them to have the aforementioned stereotypical look as that means that they are healthy. 
One thing that bothers me is that the dove women are considered healthy. Geez people grow up and realize that compared to the above model and a middle of the road healthy citizen they are NOT healthy.","1343779724"

The music analogy tries to point out that such concerns are like the volume of the music you are listening to.

"OrcsMustDie","t5_2sz2r","The differences between the starting traps are more substantial than you realize: the Tar trap affects every enemy that walks across it. It is one of the only traps with no down time. The Ice Vent has a long reset time, but since frozen enemies take more damage and it can be spec'd to be placed on the ceiling (i.e. instant kill to fliers), it has some niche uses that are very effective.

The Acid Sprayer inflicts damage over time, so it must be placed more strategically than the Arrow Wall. Also the Bile Flyers (or whatever they are called) resist acid damage, so Arrow Wall is more effective against the first fliers that you see for a while.

The Sorceress' charm ability makes her MUCH more capable of handling ogres and other large enemies that are typically the bane of the War Mage.

How much, exactly, do you need to come up with?  How do you plan to pay the loan back?  What happens when the rent is due again next month?  Going further into debt when you're already broke isn't a great idea.  Do you have anything you can sell?  What about the car?  You might want to consider selling the car and buying something for a few thousand dollars less if that's an option.

Also, talk to your landlord and see if he'll work out some kind of arrangement with you to push your rent payment back until you get some more money.  It can't hurt to ask. 

If you're intent on borrowing as the solution, do you have any credit cards (I typically wouldn't advise this, but it's got to be better than a loan shark)?

"xxfitness","t5_2ryzy","Of course I don't mind! 

I'm super simplistic in my work out routines, partly because I'm still pretty unsure about what I'm doing and also because I'm just generally adverse to complication. 

I push for 30 minutes of cardio 5 days a week, but that doesn't always happen. I work two jobs, I'm remodeling my apartment, and I'm also taking summer classes. Because I have so much going on, that 30 minutes sometimes turns into 20 and that 5 days sometimes becomes 4. 

I don't beat myself up over less productive weeks than others, though, and I think that has really improved my relationship with the gym. I like going 5 days a week, and I like spinning my little 30 minutes away. It doesn't feel like a chore to me any longer, and I attribute that almost solely to the fact that I don't get resentful or angry about not going as often as I feel like I should. The gym is my friend, and we make time for each when we can, but we're not resentful if something comes up. 

I also try to have the same relationship with the cardio machines. For a long time, I really enjoyed running. I'd log my three miles, sometimes more, (I never stop at 30 minutes if I have the time or feel like I have it in me to continue) like a champ and go on about my work out. After a few weeks, though, running on a treadmill just became impossibly monotonous and boring. I wasn't enjoying it any more and I knew when that happened, I needed to make change. If I'm not enjoying it, I grow resentful and unenthusiastic. I don't want that in my gym environment.

So I tried the elliptical for a while. I enjoyed it but also grew bored. I'm spinning now and although my ass is always sore, I enjoy it so much! When that ceases to keep me excited and eager, I'll start running and the cycle will begin again. 

With that being said (sorry it's so long, I got excited), I usually lift and squat. I don't get fancy, frankly because I don't know how to get fancy. I get my 10lbs or 12lbs weights and do 3 sets of 10 of the following: shoulder press, bicep curls, and tricep dips. I later take the same weights and do stationary lunges until my legs are shaking, and I feel like I'm making a noodley fool of myself. I just recently became interested in squatting, so I've been experimenting with that - 45lbs, 3 sets of 10 usually finishes me. To all of those who are squatting so much more: ULTIMATE RESPECT. That shit is hard.

All of my ab exercises come from a YouTube video called 8 Minutes Abs. It's an early 90s video that seems silly, but it's actually really effective. I try to do the 8 minutes abs as often as I can, even if just bits and pieces of it. You have it memorized after watching it a few times. 

Beyond that, that's it. I usually just try to listen to my body at all times. If I'm not feeling well, I don't work as hard. If I'm feeling like a champ, I push it to the max. If I want a piece of cake, I'll have two bites of cake. My goal is just to stay on good terms with the gym and food. As long as I have healthy relationships with both, I think I'll be okay.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Are they regulated more heavily than firearms?

For a firearm purchase, even person-to-person, there are certain requirements that must be observed. Age, residency status, and a reasonable belief that the person must be eligible to purchase and possess a firearm.

Cigarettes?  Age, if its even checked.

Driving? Age and a minor proficiency test.

Alcohol? Age.

My point is, there must be a balance between freedoms and safety.  In this country's case, it has been affirmed (and reaffirmed again and again) that access to firearms are a natural right.  

Do they kill people? Absolutely, though at a *much* lower rate than any of the items above. Are they heavily regulated? Absolutely.  

If you've read my comments, you'll see that I'm pretty squarely on the fence as to how, if at all, personal sales should be regulated.

Its not a matter of simply ""requiring a background check"".  The repercussions of changing the laws on personal sales can potentially be broad and far-ranging.  It is an extraordinarily nuanced subject.","1343779743"

"programming","t5_2fwo","Harken back, my friend, to the days of yore when King Arthur ruled over the land of Camelot with the guidance of his wizard Merlin!  These were dark times, however, when the evil sorceress Morgan le Fay was known from time to time to appear in the guise of Merlin and to give Arthur the wrong advice on matters of the gravest nature.  So whenever Arthur consulted his advisor, he had to verify that the advice he was being giving was of the soundest sort.  Fortunately, although King Arthur did not share the great wisdom and insight of Merlin that let him find the best solution to a problem, he did have enough intelligence to be able to check such a solution to see that there was nothing wrong with it.  Furthermore, King Arthur had a knack for being able to ask several related questions to the problem which could only be answered satisfactorily if the advice he was being given was sound, whereas if he was being lied to he could always root out the contradiction and thus expose the fraud that was Morgan le Fay.

Now let us return to the present age where we have well advanced beyond these times as our King now has *several* wise advisors instead of just one --- though they are not as wizardly as Merlin, of course!  Unfortunately, the problems that our King faces are even worse, for from time to time *several* of his advisors will occasionally turn traitor and team up against him!  Fortunately, just like King Arthur, our King is a clever man, so when he asks his advisors for advice on the gravest of matters he will often separate them into different rooms so that they cannot communicate, and then ask each of them questions that sometimes uses answers from other advisors.  If their advise is sound, then his questions can be easily and soundly answered;  if their advice is not sound, however, then because they cannot communicate with each other he will eventually get one advisor to say something that contradicts another.

Fast forward to the future, however, where our great scientists tell us that we will one day all have quantum computers embedded into our heads!  The question that the King wonders whenever he hears this is:  will his strategy will work in this world?  After all, although he can physically separate his advisors, he has no way of knowing whether they conspired to share an entangled quantum state beforehand that allows them to coordinate their answers.  Fortunately, the powers of communication begotten by an entangled state are limited:  all that they allow you to do, in a sense, is to know what others would see if they looked at the state in a particular way.  So the question is, is our King smart enough to still ask questions in a way that allows him to overcome this advantage that his potential traitors might have, while still getting excellent advice from his advisors for the (hopefully vast majority of times) that their advice is wise and sound?

I can hold a baseball. That is a fact.

That baseball that I drop will always fall to the ground on Earth. Also a fact.

That action that causes it to fall we call gravity. However, the observational fact of gravity is separate from the descriptive theory of gravity that explains WHY it falls. Observations are facts, science can have absolute facts.

What it does not have are absolute theories since a theory cannot ever be proven, only disproven if a fact comes along that shows it to be incorrect. 

For example, we know General Relativity is not the best theory of gravity that exists because it fails in the quantum realm and does not even incorporate the uncertainty principle. ","1343779761"

I have been watching and listening to you since the Screen Savers days and I was only 10 or 11 years old. I loved your shows and watched the premiere of The Lab on G4TTV and every episode since. After you left Call for Help, I discovered TWiT. I was about to go on a trip with family and burned all of the available (25 I think) episodes onto an MP3 CD and listened to them all! After getting back I began working a paper route (still only about 12-13 at the time) and listened to a podcast or two every day, my personal favorites being TWiT and The Daily Giz Wiz. I am 18 now and you and your associates have shaped who I am today, my family's tech support and hopefully soon a programmer by trade.

Sorry for the ranting, question time!

1. Were there any hurt feelings with the end of Call for Help and The Lab?
2. How do you maintain patience with the technology-disabled on your The Tech Guy show and what would you recommend for someone going into the field?
3. What was your favorite show to work on?
4. Did you know that old episodes of The Lab and Call for Help are still in rotation on G4TTV in Canada?

Thank you very much for everything you've done and I hope I hear back from you.","1343779767"

As for meteorite, if you want it that badly, dont make a bridge. But really, it's not very useful. 

If you want mobility, a skybridge is also bad because it will take time to get up there. Just grind to rocket boots (much easier as of 1.1) and learn how to use them and hermes and a grappling hook for fast travel.

Source code not required, but you need to at least say whether it's a VM getting resized, or allocating more compute cycles to a zone/chroot jail, or something else.
- You need more details on what is or isn't supported.  Sure, I'm interested, but I'll be annoyed if I sign up only to find out that this only works with Clojure and Ingres.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","As far as I know, Gandhi's specific movement was peaceful, but his success lay in the fact that the alternative to Gandhi was violent resistance. After ww2, the Brits were aware they couldn't hold India militarily if the Indian population didn't want them there. There were factions advocating violent rebellion (one had even sided with the Japanese in WW2)

The British government was left with a choice- An all or nothing war with rebels in a time when public opinion around the world was firmly against empire, or a graceful bowing out where they retained a lot of political and economic interest.

As for the article itself, I take the view that it's remarkably easy to smear any prominent figure who's lead as long a life as Gandhi did. The guy was human and subject to all the contradictions that entails. Some of the claims are likely true, some are probably based on unreliable sources, and some are taken out of context.

At the end of the day, he's the reason there was a (mostly) peaceful transition of power instead of a bloody war, purges, and basically the sort of shit that went down when the French were chased out of SE asia.","1343779771"

"Militaryfaq","t5_2tf5m","Hey, no it's not too late I still check it periodically.  When it comes to minimum weight, it really depends on the recruiter and how willing he/she is to work with you.  Honestly it has less to do with the recruiter and more to do with the recruiter's boss, because the boss sets her own rules when it comes to minimum weight.  The real answer is that if you are a few pounds under your minimum weight, it's really not that big of a deal...I deal with underweight applicants all the time, they're seriously not an issue.  As long as you aren't so drastically underweight that you appear anorexic then you're fine.  As kind of a rule of thumb though I wouldn't typically process anyone that was more than 10 lbs under their minimum weight because they wouldn't typically meet the body mass index (BMI) minimum...which is like 18 or something, can't remember exactly what it is.  Anyways if you're just a few pounds under and that recruiter refuses to work with you, find another one.  If, however, you're more than 10 lbs under or so then I would seriously try gaining some weight.  

The best way to gain weight SAFELY is by consuming lots of protein.  I strongly recommend drinking a protein supplement, you can get them easily from most health food stores like GNC etc.  Light workouts (WEIGHTS) are also highly recommended, I would try to avoid cardio as that's going to burn a lot of calories and will cancel out the protein you're taking in.  Protein supplements will ONLY help if you're doing some weight lifting or other muscle building exercises.  Muscle is built (and thus weight gained) by tearing (good tearing, not bad tearing) of your muscles through strength training exercises.  When the muscle tears, new cells form around the torn muscle and heal it.  

This is why your muscles hurt after a good strength training workout...they've been traumatized and torn to bits (in a good way).  When the new cells form, they build your muscle, thus causing more weight to exist in your body.  High amounts of protein facilitate this process by both speeding it up and providing more nutrients for the cells to feed off of, so that a higher amount can grow.  I know this is all technical mumbo jumbo, but I only explain it so that you can understand why it's important to not only take in the high protein, but also to exercise!","1343779773"

"conspiracy","t5_2qh4r","Yes. Facts can prove it.
Take a look at syrian proviences, the ones that are mainly pro Assad (such as Tartous) are civilized open minded people with a high education rate and a low crime rate, and take a look at the majority protesting areas, they are extreme islamist who dont allow their young daughters to finish their education, and a high crime rate, even tho both areas have the same health care and the same laws, and all thru out syria education is free, including universities. 
Im not ""acusing"" them of these things, these are facts and statistics that you can look up. 
The supporting people of bashar all happen to be educated, open minded people both poor and rich, and they live in comunities that consist of muslims, christians, jews, and atheists openly with no extreme terrorists who attack under the name of god. I know this first hand, because while my parents were driving accross syria about 15 years ago, my dad got attacked in one of those areas and they told him that it is because my mom doesnt cover her hair. Over the past 19 years, i remember multiple occassions when i was in syria and got harrassed by those people for similar reasons, while in the supporting areas, i am encouraged to er open about my believes (atheist) and a woman is considered part of the society. Im not cruel, but the ""rebels"" took away 3 of my family members during the past year simply because we are from that certain city, my family members are no activist, they do not work for the government and they have nothing to do with politics. 1 of them was a 16 year old female, the other was a taxi driver, and the 3rd was a truck driver. We know that it was the rebels who did it, because they sent us videos of them doing it, they said and i quote ""after we win, we are coming for the rest of you"" (it was said in arabic) . These are the three that got attacked after the revolution, i have lost other family members over the past years under the excuse that we are ""infidles"" . When i see my syrian soldiers walking with guns, i feel proud of president al-assad and the saftey that he is trying to bring back to our homes after decades of THEM attacking us. Everytime One of those rebels die, the world loses 1 terrorist.","1343779774"

Soda is a heavy salt intake source?

I used to be pretty overweight (235 peak, 225 for the longest period of time) till I started a keto diet in January.  Did that for about four months, got down to 180 (normal BMI), and now I just eat generally low glycemic index (so, avoiding sugars/grains/starches in general, buying sweet potatoes and fruit for carb sources).  However, I tend to really crave salt, so when I eat salads (usually olive oil, vinegar or lemon juice, and salt) or meat or eggs I tend to salt it a fair bit.  Not, like, caking it, but I like the taste of salt.

I generally am avoiding fast food and not touching soda.

I think there's a *decent* -- not 100%, but a *decent* -- modern consensus that Augustus was complicit in Cicero's murder.  Things were incredibly unstable at this point; Antony (who ordered Cicero's proscription probably) did not have a power hold over Octavian--they each effectively carried a veto over the other for serious, important matters (or at least a balance of power).

&gt;If all the books in the world were destroyed, including science books, and everyone forgot everything and we had to start over, would religion come back the same way?

As a (partial) pagan, I think so. Sort of.

The pagan, or country, religons evolved more or less organically. Secular practices began to be associated with the gods- don't forget the beliefs of yore where created as a way to explain the (then) unexplainable. Conformation helped to strengthen the beliefs.

If the country beliefs are right, then the gods will walk among us again as we turn to them for safety and explanation, because mortals have learned our place in the order of the world OR they will evolve to incorporate our new values/understandings (See the Rick Riordian series for how I imagine that would go). 

If they're wrong, then the beliefs of the gods will grow again, but in different form.

&gt;So, why doesn't this glaring bit of crazy stick out to theists?

You know, you've mainly addressed this post to Christians. But this does stick out . And not every religon claims to be ""the one true way"".","1343779783"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; and stockpiling them.

I've never understood the irrational fear that someone is ""stockpiling"" guns. Is a crazy person with 50 guns more dangerous than a person with 3? Guns are heavy, ammo is comparatively not. It would always make sense to carry more ammo and less guns once you move past 3.

So why do people buy more than 3 guns? For variety and fun in the sport of shooting.

On this subject, another example of a gun control law that makes zero sense. In California (and I believe other states) there is a mandatory waiting period on all new gun purchases. In CA it's a 10-day wait and you can only buy a pistol once every 30 days, *regardless of how many guns you already own*. 

So if I already own a 9mm, .45 and .40 caliber pistols, then I buy a .357 magnum on the first of the month, I'd have to then wait 40 days to take delivery of a .22 caliber pea shooter. 

These are what some people think are common-sense gun laws, and while the majority of gun owners in the country don't even want to discussion to come to the table. ","1343779785"

Atheism is a lack of belief, you can't believe in atheism.

&gt;So, what proof do you guys have that athiesm exists or can exist?

Atheism exists because there are atheists. I think you're trying to ask though why we think that a god wouldn't exist. The reason why I, and most atheists, do not believe in a god is because there is no evidence to believe in one.

&gt;I havent seen any proof but Christianity has a whole book on why its true. Thanks for ansering the question!

The bible is inaccurate, contradicts reality as well as itself, and is unverifiable in all accounts that haven't already been proven false. It is not valid evidence in favor of Christianity just as any other holy texts do not provide proof in their respective religions.

I love how matter of fact that is. ""I'm a jackass IRL AND on the internet. At least I'm consistent.""

&gt;I'm stating facts here.

I dare ask. Have you ever been to a funeral? Do you state, matter of fact, the imperfections of the deceased? I mean, it would be both unwarranted and highly rude. Consistency seems to be something you're proud of.

&gt;You're an ass for singling me out and grouping me with the ones that criticized her wildly.


Well now. How rude of me. If there's one thing that's rude it's calling out one bully, but not all of them.

&gt;Again, you're a jerk and your white-knighting is sad.

Very sad. So sad. Look at how pathetic I am. :[ So sad. The meaning of all of those words put together has inflicted quite the grievous emotional wound upon me.

&gt;And FYI, cosplayers show their costumes to... show-off and have fun. It's only natural that people will take pictures and share them.

I didn't realize you were the voice of all cosplayers.

&gt;If you want to remain anonymous and blend in with the wall, then don't put on a god damn costume.

Damn. Now if ever I saw a great quote on how to blame the victims of bullying for being bullied, this would be it. ""It's not your fault you're so easy to pick on."" 

Now here's a novel idea: Try not being a bully. BAM. So easy. 

&gt; I JUST THINK THAT SHE AND HER FRIEND ARE OVER-SENSITIVE AND STUPID FOR READING SOME RANDOM IDIOTS' NECKBEARD INSULTS.

YEAH VICTIMS OF BULLYING. GROW A THICKER SKIN. IT'S OBVIOUSLY A PERFECTED SCIENCE BY NOW.

Other nobel prize winning ideas using claz's logic:

Put an end to murders by not dying during attempted murders.

Put an end to world hunger by not being hungry.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","I've had a thought for a while that may be an interesting (and challenging to make!) addition to the game and I'd love to hear your thoughts. 

Is there a way to have 'seasons' in the game? As in, things would grow slower and die easier in 'winter?' No more snow biomes, instead have most of the maps snow in 'winter?' You could turn seasons on and off too when making a game, so you could do it easier or have the challenge of stocking up etc. 

I have no idea how to code it or if it's practical, it just has been banging around my head while I've been playing that it would be a cool element to add to the play.

"DragonsDogma","t5_2smmb","1) Randomize the enemy spawns in the overworld.  Let big monsters have huge roaming territories, while small monsters spawn in semi-random format to keep the area fresh.

2) Eliminate stat growth's dependency on class, letting people freely choose vocation.  Encourage switching classes to take on different challenges.

3) Provide different ways for each class to heal itself so that mages aren't mandatory.  Second winds, vampiric attacks, healing shields, etc.

4) Create more dungeon delves, destinations with specific rewards.  Put more off-the-beaten-path destinations on the map to encourage players to challenge themselves.

5) Allow players to craft weapons at a blacksmith.  Conversely, have stats even out at the highest upgrade tiers so that people can choose gear based on looks, not on higher numbers.

6) Unlink sidequests from the main quest, allowing you to progress at either one without lockouts.  Put serious effort into improving the flow of story.

7) Make romance a choice via the Arisen's Bond.  Giving someone the bond starts the actual romance part of the quest, everything before that is just amiable acquaintance territory.

8) Add lots more monsters.  Add more variants of each monster so that a big creature has several different styles, mid-tier monsters like warg riders or dire bears that can be mixed into groups, and lots more small monsters with plenty of unique individuals (so you have five or six styles of saurians based on their weapons and strategy, without even touching the different species).

9) Turn the ""kill 10 wolves"" BS into randomly generated bounty quests.  Pick up a quest to kill a manticore raiding the caravan route, and a manticore is spawned on that route for you to slay.  Simple, clean, fun, efficient.

10) Put the plus into New Game+.  Allow players to crank up the difficulty, going beyond simply increasing the stats.  Something similar to Bastion's god system, where the player can activate voluntary challenges to change the game, adding more enemies, increasing their power, granting them immunities, etc.  Let players volunteer to have their game turn into a hellscape filled with impossibly strong nasties to let thrillseekers craft their ultimate challenge.

11) ?????

12) Profit from one of the best open world RPG sequels in years.","1343779798"

There's also this:



1.Navigate to the Microsoft software download page. See Resources.
        



2. Select ""Controller"" from the ""Type of Product"" menu, ""Xbox 360 Controller for Windows"" from the ""Product"" menu, then your operating system and operating system language from their respective menus. Click the ""Go"" button when finished.
        



3. Click the ""Xbox 360 Accessories Software..."" link, then save the file to a location on your computer.
        


4. Double click the downloaded file and follow the prompts to complete the installation.
       



5. Plug the USB end of your controller into an available USB port on your computer.
       


6. Launch Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.
        



7. Use your keyboard arrows to scroll to the ""Configuration"" button, then press the ""Enter"" key.
        


8. Press the arrows keys to scroll to the ""Controller Setup"" option, then press the ""Enter"" key.
        



9. Press ""Enter"" to select the ""Configuration"" option, then choose the ""Joypad"" option. The game will automatically recognize the Xbox 360 controller at this point and map the controls for the game accordingly.


Tips and warnings:

Once you have installed the software for the Xbox 360 controller, you will be able to play many other games on your computer with that controller. All that is necessary is to connect the controller to an available USB port, then select the Xbox 360 controller from the game's menu.


In many cases the game will already recognize that the Xbox 360 controller is connected to the computer, and will set that as the controller for the game automatically. To see if that is the case, attempt to use the controller to navigate the menus once the game has launched.

I don't think the expectation here is that people see this and change their life.  It's about creating a culture where it is not ok to blame other people for your weight (for better or worse - that's a complex issue I'm NOT passing judgment on here).

Saying that this kind of stuff is useless is like saying cigarette advertising was not effective (it is mostly banned now, because it was so effective).  Of course it doesn't make anyone start smoking, but it creates a culture where the discussion around smoking is that it's ""Ok,"" much like the media in America has created a culture that makes talking about your weight as if it was caused by your genes acceptable (and here I AM passing judgment).","1343779809"

The entire notion that it's ""illegal"" to sell to people you think might be criminals is retarded. The only legally defensible thing you need to do is prove that you didn't ""know"" they were a criminal/were going to use it for a criminal act. How could anyone prove otherwise?

The fact that you even do background checks at all shows you understand this problem. It should be required for essentially *any* sale.

It makes *zero* sense to have it only apply in certain situations. Especially when an ""individual sale"" is exactly the kind of sale a criminal wants to begin with. No paper trail, no receipt and possibly even no recollection on the part of the seller.

The Bad
its slow, really really slow. It barely hits the top speed of 25 on the flat...after a run up. 
The traverse is actually pretty good for a heavy, terrible for a medium (a bit of guess there, i don't own a tier 8 medium or have any high tier that can turn on the spot, but it felt quite good turning on a spot). 
low pen on the gun, this pretty much means you need to beat up lower tier tanks or get lucky. There is a possibility that the new match making will give it top spot each time, if that is the case, the SP might be OK.

• fonts iOS lack (Myriad Pro &amp; Sketch Block)
• bookmarks to a word in the document
• equations (from MathType)

While all these can be seen on the Mac version, the iOS version changes the Myriad Pro and Sketch Block to Helvetica, removes the bookmarks and turns the equations into grey boxes. But even if I edit, say, a word on the iOS version or pages of stuff to the document, the Mac version retains the equations, bookmarks and even the style (so my Myriad Pro doesn't get changed to Helvetica).

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Here's the thing: premarital sex is a grey area. In biblical times, Jewish kids got married young, like as soon as they hit childbearing age. The idea of ""teenage years"" and adolescence is a 20th century development. So young people didn't back then have to navigate through this morass of abstinence or ""saving yourself for marriage.""

I don't know what the right answer is. To be honest with you, in high school, I had no idea how to talk to girls, so premarital sex wasn't exactly a temptation that I had any realistic chance of falling into. Then I went to a Christian college, where I did learn how to talk to girls, but most people (not all) were in the waiting-for-marriage boat. 

For whatever reason, God has made it easier for me to abstain. It might be even easier for me now that I'm 23 and out of college; I have a much better idea of the woman I want to end up with, so why settle just for the sake of losing my virginity? I'm not someone who's really been there before. I wish I could offer you advice that speaks to your experience, but I can't.

So I can only repeat what I've heard. Of all the married Christians I've talked to, they all unanimously have said: Don't have sex. These include people that have had premarital sex. I don't think it's the end of the world if you do, but apparently it's better if you don't.

It doesn't matter what modern culture might tell us - sex is powerful. Sex is the most intimate expression of love between two people, and it has permanent, lasting effects on our hearts. It's not something to be given away lightly. 

Lust is a sin. There's no way around it. It's not circular reasoning - Jesus said it in the Sermon on the Mount: ""You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’ But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. (Matthew 5:27-28 ESV)"" Even though Jesus fulfilled Old Testament law and set it aside so that it no longer condemns us (Romans 8:1), we live by Jesus' teachings, and a lot of Jesus' teachings was reinterpreting the Law for us. So if Jesus calls it a sin, it's a sin. 

As the Heidelberg Catechism goes, ""What is your only comfort in life and death? That I am not my own, but belong body and soul, both in life and in death, to my faithful savior Jesus Christ.""

My personal opinion on premarital sex is that you won't find the Bible explicitly condemning or condoning it - it's not an instruction manual - so you need to search your heart: am I doing this to show God I love Him, or because I want my own way?

"femalefashionadvice","t5_2s8o5","Okay, so I saw this contest and at first thought, ""yay pretty clothes to look at! I wonder what noma is...""

I then looked up Noma, and discovered that it's located in Copenhagen. I'm currently traveling through Europe, and will be in Copenhagen in a few days, and I started wondering... do I have anything that I could wear in my exceedingly skimpy wardrobe that might be appropriate for such a place as Noma?

As a background, the tops I brought are 4 t-shirts, 6 tank tops, two spaghetti-straps tops (black and white), and a few 'nicer' shirts from Target. The bottoms I have are a pair of jean shorts, a pair of leggings, and two pairs of jeans (one that is sort of nice). I also have a pair of fingerless gloves, a beanie, and a scarf.

I focused on the scarf. [It's a very nice scarf](http://i.imgur.com/bdmidh.jpg). My friend bought it in Morocco.  If there's anything in my closet that could be nice enough for Noma, it would be this scarf.

I have absolutely no fashion sense; that's why I'm subscribed to FFA.  However, I've seen quite a few different ways to wear a scarf, and I'd like to think that I'm somewhat creative.  I also have a lifetime of experience of wrapping a bath towel around myself after a shower and pretending that I'm a fashion designer, but that's another story.

So anyway, I wrap myself up in the scarf. [My first attempt is not bad](http://i.imgur.com/5bKFih.jpg), I think. [I use the scarf as a shirt](http://i.imgur.com/yYOOkh.jpg) and wear the legggings under it.  However, there was the slight downside of [random fringe hanging over my ass](http://i.imgur.com/cFDLPh.jpg).  That would not do; therefore, my first attempt I consider a failure.

[For my second attempt](http://i.imgur.com/u9JbVh.jpg), I wore the black spaghetti strap top, arranged artfully enough so that it seemed to be a tube top.  I used the scarf as a skirt.  ""HAHA!"" I think, ""This is awesome! I am a master of fashion!"" I then take a few pictures.  Things seem to be going well, until I realize that [I'm still holding the scarf up with my hand](http://i.imgur.com/77HQ4h.jpg).  Once more, my attempt is a failure.

Third time's the charm, however. I muster up all of my creative talents and pull together [a moderately respectable outfit](http://i.imgur.com/XOGfJh.jpg) that only differs from the second in that I don't use my hand to hold the scarf on. Instead, [I used a hairclip](http://i.imgur.com/TEDrRh.jpg).

TL;DR: If I somehow end up going to Noma next week, my mysterious benefactor who is paying for my trip will have to take me shopping beforehand.  [I don't have any good shoes anyway](http://i.imgur.com/0xhOYh.jpg).

I'm sorry if this somehow breaks the rules of the contest; it's 2am here and I'm having trouble sleeping so I did this instead.  Insomnia tends to make me feel inordinately clever. But at least I had fun? :)

But you know what? that is not a reason to throw your vote away.  If you really don't like either candidate then write in a third party candidate that you would want to be president and I mean someone you seriously want to be president not Steven Colbert, Jon Steward or Mickey Mouse (you would be surprised how many votes Mickey gets every year). But a two party system where both are more and more moderate is just the way a first past the post system, which we have, works. So until we change our voting system this is what you have to deal with.

And if you really don't think your vote counts start participating in smaller elections! These happen *every* year! I vote every year on every proposition, referendum, school board election *because* I am in the minority in my home state and if enough people like me vote things will change. And honestly it doesn't take that long. My state you can do early voting by mail and they send you a booklet with all the props (what they are and arguments from both sides) and candidates (and their campaign statements). With a couple quick internet searches you can be done in a night.  I usually vote while watching TV. 

Your city and state governments are actually what influence your life the most and where you can make the most impact. Lets not forget the cesspit of inaction and partisan bullshit that is US Congress. I am pretty sure your vote makes a difference in your congressional elections.

This kind of attitude to boycott elections is the reason we have one of the lowest voter turn outs in the world. And it doesn't change anything!! Nobody may count defensive votes, but you can't count a vote that doesn't exist! You aren't making a statement by not voting you are just being apathetic. There are many reason people don't vote (couldn't find a babysitter, just didn't have time, working, etc) so the powers that be do not think no vote=protesting the system or the candidates.  They think no vote=no vote or worst no vote=one less for the other guy!

I am of the mind set that if you don't vote you don't get to bitch.  You didn't exercise your right to participate in the decision making so you don't get the right to complain for the next four years.

I am sorry it really annoys me that people don't vote.

In your section ""1"" - Church Membership and the Sacraments are seen as a normal requirement for salvation. We do not think this is ""instead of"" God's grace, but rather, how God communicates His grace TO us. It's rather like saying, ""God has a gift for you. Here are the conditions on which He wants you to receive it."" It doesn't stop it being a gift.

Mary as Mediatrix is a separate topic. I would recommend this article: http://www.ewtn.com/faith/teachings/marya4.htm

In your section ""2"" You asked, if the Catholic position was so close to evangelical faith-based salvation, why not just say so and avoid the whole Reformation thing? I would answer that it's quite different to say ""You are saved by God's grace"" (which the Catholic Church has always said) and to say ""you are saved by faith alone,"" which was Martin Luther's contention. The Catholic Church rejects the faith-alone argument, because it is not scriptural. Luther based his argument on the book of Romans, but the words ""faith alone"" are never found together in Romans. Paul wrote that we are saved by faith, but never said faith alone. The only place in the Bible you can find the words ""faith alone"" put together is in James chapter 2, where it is written, ""You are not saved by faith alone.""","1343779837"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","I can elaborate more, but I wanted to refrain from a complete wall of text.

1) I would be more offended than those who come up yelling that I'm the devil. When a theist saunters up trying to friendly me up and say how Jesus loves me, it's implied that even though i've read the bible (in most cases, more thoroughly) that **I just missed some big truth or am not smart enough to process what it's trying to get across.** It's condescending in its' very nature.  
The fact is, as a whole atheists are more knowledgeable of the bible... which is WHY we don't believe it. It's faulty evidence, through and through... nothing you say changes that. 

2)I can't speak for everyone, but I view religions the same way many theists view those swindlers who ""talk to the dead"" on T.V.
They use peoples fears and loss to their financial advantage, it's sickening and angers us. 
It's a damaging thing to believe, that this life doesn't matter and it's all about some magical afterlife, and we're hostile to that. It leads not only to suicide bombers and mass murders but to less direct things like dangerous political choices which take away peoples rights.

1) I got the 6770s for $75 each, but when crossfired they are [supposedly comparable](http://www.guru3d.com/article/his-radeon-6770-iceqx-turbo-crossfire-review/19) to a HD 6970. Considering that the cheapest [HD 6970 on Newegg](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814150517) is $340 I feel like I got a good value for performance in this situation.

2) As for the hard drives, first I have them running in RAID 0 and I got them for $50 total including shipping from someone over on [r/hardwareswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardwareswap/). As you can see those drives are $62 each new online.

3) The G. Skill RAM was included with the CPU, Mobo, and one of the GPUs when I bought them for $280 off of Craigslist. Those items combined are $377 new. I picked up the extra RAM because it had the same timings and someone was selling it for $20 on Craigslist.

I agree it's very odd, but in the end I saved a very large amount of money, which was the driving factor of my purchases. I hope that helps answer you're questions!

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt; They said the Earth was flat. The video you linked is not about pseudo-science, it is about theoretical physics. It is science, like it or not.

The video strings together actual scientific theories in a way that _isn't_ scientific, therefore it isn't science. Furthermore, many references are made to things that _isn't_ science - for example, the whole conscious observer bit, quantum suicide, and the many-worlds interpretation. So by incorporating these ideas _as if it is science_, the video is promoting pseudoscience.

&gt; I agree that the observer doesn't have to be conscious. But for that event to be recorded or communicated among humans requires consciousness.

That's more philosophy than science, especially since consciousness in this sense is very poorly defined. That's precisely the reason it isn't science.

What do I mean? Take the two possible scenarios:

1) Let's say it is, in fact, consciousness that collapses a wavefunction (or a chain of wavefunctions).

2) The opposite: consciousness is not required for a wavefunction to collapse.

Can you devise an experiment to differentiate between the two? This is the simplest test for whether something is scientific. Well, from your argument, since any test actively requires consciousness, there isn't a test we can do to separate 1) from 2). So asserting that consciousness is required is interesting _philosophically_, but it isn't _scientific_.

Please note that I'm seriously not just trying to shit on your ideas. I just want you to understand the differences between your idea of science and the subreddit's definition of science. You argue that there is a ""know it all attitude"" when in fact none is presented. We do, however, present an argument with as much confidence as is allowed in the scientific method (that is, a very substantial amount of confidence in many areas), and that's probably what you disagree with. But I, amongst others, believe you're overblowing the amount of uncertainty in what's discussed here.","1343779862"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Well, I'm a lifeguard at my local pool and all of my favorite shit stories come from that horrible place.

1 - kids frequently poop and then refuse to use toilet paper. they simply shove their hand right in the crack of their ass and go to town until they think they are sufficiently clean, at which point they look and find that apparently the wall is the only proper place to dispense of the filth that is currently making their hand smell worse than all of the shits in this thread combined. 

2 - somehow people make the mistake of trusting their small children to realize that the pool is not the correct place to take a massive shit. Lucky us, the lifeguards get to hop in, goggles on and armed with a net that would be useless catching and holding a butterfly let alone a huge turd.

3 - my personal favorite has to be this one. A mother of three had decided her youngest son (less than one year old) had to be breast fed while they were sitting on the stairs leading to the shallow end of the pool. It was at this precise moment that her oldest son (probably 4 or 5) was on the diving board.

2) I don't like having to worry whether or not my system can run a new game well. With consoles, I ALWAYS know that my new game will work on my system.

Changing your perspective is incredibly hard sometimes, but it is possible. If this is purely about the relationship and your own self perception, I'd recommend counseling and literature with regular reflection time (*12-Step Guide for Codependents* is good). It sounds humiliating and cliche, but those twelve step programs are around for a reason, and they DO work if you put the work into them. You may even find by forcing yourself to work on that, you've already changed things just with the commitment and concentration.

If you just need a change, MOVE. New locations are scary, can be depressing but they are also exhilarating and liberating if you go into it with the right frame of mind. Get involved wherever you choose to live and open yourself up to platonic, volunteer, work and hobby relationships. 

Lastly, I recommend you get the fuck outside and breathe. Just being outside lightens your mood. Walk, sit, get a dog and play, I don't care. Just do it. Feel free to contact me if you want someone to talk to as well.","1343779869"

Pardon my metaphor, but every single guy knows that, just as much as any LoL player knows that hitting skillshots is better than missing them. A tip on how to actually improve your skill shot accuracy, would be better.

 Something in the lines of: Wait for the opposing AD carry to go in for a last hit, then quickly unload your skillshot(s) at him/her. Thit is a secure way of ensuring that your skillshot(s) are going to hit, as the movement of the enemy is predictable as well as the wind-up animation on his/her auto attack makes it impossible for him/her to move at the same time as going in for the last hit.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","He *can* create good (and has, in the creation of the universe), 
but any *person* is free to do evil.  

Each day He creates a batch of people.  
Each of those people will commit some wrongdoing in their life of which they are guilty.  
Nearly all of the people will have positive and negative effects on others in their lives.  
Some of the people will choose to seek God's mercy.   
All of the people will die (except those present on the last day).

Or a tapestry of billions of threads.  

Suppose the threads of the people that are in right relationship with God by the end of their life  
are gold-colored at that end,
and those that are not saved are rust-colored at their death end.  
Some people had rust at first, then a stretch of gold, then they drifted away and are back to rust.  

You could ask ""why doesn't he just *not create* any threads that he knows will be rust-colored at their death end"".  

His *goal* is that each thread is gold-colored at the end, and He is actively working at the present point 
that each currently rust-colored thread should choose to become gold.  He is interacting at the present ""edge"" 
with the whole world.  

And with the threads which currently have a gold section (people currently in right relationship with Him),  
He is currently working through those to give ripple effects on the rust-colored threads

Guys don't wear skin tight outfits like women, so the only indicator of how in shape they are is broad shoulders and a narrow waist which is only apparent if you wear slim fit clothing. No woman can tell the difference between a guy with no gut at 15% body fat to a guy at a shredded 7% body fat with an 8-pack when he's wearing clothes.

Get in shape because it will definitely boost your confidence and having a lower body fat percentage will make your face more attractive (more defined jawline and more pronounced cheekbones).

What I see this as is a girl can have sex with her boyfriend (or a hookup whatever you want to call it) and when she gets pregnant due to teenage idiocy she can just frolick to the abortion clinic and end a human life. I personally don't think that is okay. But if the girl is raped or some other case of forced sexual intercourse then that is fine because and only because it wasn't the girls fault that the person who raped her finished inside her. This could also be the case in a relationship where the female does not want the male to finish inside her but he does anyway (can be considered rape to some extent). 

tl;dr - girl getting abortions just cause she can =/= okay. Girl who is sexually assaulted and needs abortion - fine. 


Now I'm not too sure that this is the conservative point of view but I know almost all of my republican friends feel this way.

Neither of those is a working strategy, so he needs advice from other people who have been in that situation to tell him what WOULD work.

Now, most guys wouldn't really need to ask advice about this, because that's shit they learned how to deal with back when they were 15 making out with girls in their parent's basement. But some guys didn't get those formative experiences, so they need solid advice","1343779888"

"occult","t5_2qhmc","That's rather fascinating, as I came to largely the same conclusion about history through studying eastern and continental philosophy and lacanian psychoanalysis. Schopenhauer, Lacan, Confucius, Xunzi and Dogen when mixed together with some meditation and high quality lsd kind of arrived at the same point.

There is something odd on a formal level with the designation of the word “afterlife”. While its use calls to mind visions of heavens, angels, valhallas and the like, there is the more literal interpretation here presented: what happens after-life.  To look at it from another perspective, the earliest forms of human religion seem to have stemmed from the worship of dead ancestors and fertility deities, which may have been intertwined at their root. Ancient people believed that honoring their ancestors ensured the continued fertility of the land, their animals and themselves, extending the formal gesture that they were the result of their ancestor's own fertility. Almost like the Freudian concept of drive, this ritual conception seeks to ensure the conditions of its own propagation in an endless cycle. Add to that the driving force behind everything, the dharmakaya, the thing-in-itself, the will of all, the schopenhauerian will...

I remember that my mother said to me once, ""this wasn't supposed to happen"" and I instantly was sent for a loop, because logically such a proposition makes no sense. Things are either supposed to happen or they don't because fate is in-essence hindsight on history. There's the countless dead ancestors who lead to my existence and the countless dead me's that led me to this point, the sheer weight of inertial entropy   where I seem always to be living out my past decisions in the present moment. I cannot be the same person I am now when this sentence is done.

While I'm not a thelemite by any stretch of the imagination, I did have this thought the other day: ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law"", as compared to Confucius' ""History is the law of heaven,"" and ""The Law is love, love under will"" as compared to Nietzsche's Amor fati...

Before the FDA existed, people used to buy all sorts of snake oil bullshit.  Hell, in some parts of the world they still do.

&gt;  Absent the FDA I believe that firms would hire their own independent companies to do tests on these things, independent companies that are known and trusted for these things so that a product would have ""independent company name here"" proven written on the side. 

Nobody is independent if you throw enough money at them.  Also if a real independent tester disapproved of my product, I'd just setup my own “*independent*” lab to approve it for me.  Most importantly, if the free-market could have done this all by itself, it raises the question:  Why didn't it?

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Hey there!

That's a great question to ask!  There are many different parts of testing that goes into medications.  As others have mentioned, we do clinical trials to show that the medication works, but for certain people.  We do more studies afterwards to show that it works in other people (for example, different doses for adults and children).  This is, for the most part, how we can determine what is a safe and effective dose for patients across the age spectrum.  However, this is on a per medication basis.  

We also monitor for side effects of the medications.  We can tell if a patient is getting too much if the patient starts experiencing the side effects.  On the other hand, we can also tell if a patient is getting too little of a medication if the patient isn't getting any better.

There's too many things to list about my job, but I think it's the experience of working as a fundamental part of a healthcare team.  Together, we strive to make sure that the patient gets better.  I also get to see a lot of things I wouldn't be able to see if I were working in a Walgreens or any other retail pharmacy (though, my colleagues are definitely working in the trenches, props to them).

Many programs are moving forward and starting to require a bachelor's degree to get into their Doctor of Pharmacy programs (more commonly known as a PharmD).  The PharmD program is a 4 year professional program.  It's usually a minimum of at least 6 years of college.  I personally did 6 years of college and am currently in a postgraduate training (residency) program.  I would like to say that for some of my classmates, it is their second or even third profession.  I plan on going back to school to become a physician (MD) so I can better help patients.

I would like to give you some little bits of wisdom...if you can even consider it that.

* Take your time in deciding what you want to do in the future.  It's a huge world with lots of different types of science fields.  You're young and already have an inquisitive mind, a bonus to any field.

* This is how I always go into my daily routine: Patients are my #1 priority, and the day that I don't care about my patients is the day that I quit.  That day has and will not come.

Thank YOU for having such an interest in what we have to offer.  I sincerely wish you good luck in the future!","1343779900"

"darksouls","t5_2sazo","Even though you just played a strength character, for helping out hosts I’d go strength tank again. With faith like Emayerage said, that way you don’t have to rely on your new to Dark Souls friends healing you when you need it.  
  
I’d run zweihander, stone armour and eagle shield, all of which you can get quickly at the very start of the game with a few suicide runs (eagle shield is a little harder but you can easily use dragon crest shield until you find it).    
  
OK playstyle and justification on why I chose what I chose. You don’t want to just run in and kill everything for your friends, it will be of more benefit to them if you are able to act as a diversion keep enemies focused on you while they run around and attack/backstab them. This way your friends don’t just have someone playing their game for them. This is where the eagle shield comes in handy, that thing eats hits without eating stamina or needing 50 str to wield, you should be able to tank for quite a while without fear of having your guard broken quickly while you buddy wails on the enemy. The zweihander is used for its flattening ability and poise eating swings. If you’re buddy is getting stunlocked or having a hard time with an enemy you can use the R2 to flatten it and give him from breathing room, or if there are a few enemies on him you can use the wide swing to stunlock/break the attacks of them. Now because this weapon has some big wind ups you’ll want some decent poise, hence the stone armour. You’re not good to anyone if you can’t swing you weapon due to getting stunned all the time. Another good thing about the zwei is you can go the elemental/divine route and not waste points trying to get it to scale with str, whilst still having it do serious damage. This leaves more points for you to put into vitality, endurance and faith. Stone armour is great too as it doesn’t need to (and can’t) be upgraded so you have more souls to put into upgrading yourself, your zwei, your shield, and your pyro flame.  
  
Onto the miracle side of things, I’d run healing miracles (and when you get high enough level use the Princess Guard healing miracles so you can heal you friends too) and lightning spear, but run a pyromancy glove and combustion/great combustion as well for those bosses immune to lightning (Gwyn, Ornstein) and for something quicker casting than lightning spear. This way you have lightning to use against Quelaag and Ceaseless and fire to use against Gwyn and Ornstein.

The [Federation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition](www.fpmt.org) has centers all over the world. They usually have teachings on a regular basis on a number of topics but mostly covering the idea of being happy/positive.  

On another note, beating yourself up over your negativity is just creating more negativity.

A stoic quote I like 'We were created for our own good, we were not created for our own evil.' At least that's the jist of it. Feel free to PM me with any questions or discussion. 

Helping others to be happy and free from anger and the ignorance leading to negativity is regarded highly in Buddhism. It's a bit religious-promotional but the lack of dogma (strict rules) in Buddhism really takes the 'sell' out of it.

Third, you *need* sufficient momentum to mount effectively. You can get onto the saddle with a little hop but without momentum you're just waiting to tip over while you fumble around with your pedals.

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","In a nutshell:

It has the occasional joke, but the premise of the show isn't humor. I would say the main premise of the show is a group of 6 best friends learning ""the magic of friendship"" with a different lesson for each episode.  season 2 branched off into other general life topics such as taking care of babies and family appreciation. 

Most ""lessons"" are learned in an episode, but the season openings and finales are usually 2 parters that are pretty epic and play out like a movie. 

The show appeals to a lot of people I'd say because the 6 main characters all embody different personality types that people can relate to. My favorite character is the bookish and introvert purple pony, because I can relate to her. I've yet to see another character anywhere that I can relate to as much as her. She hooked me on the show right away. 

I think the show's lasting appeal is it's focus on the underdiscussed topic of friendship. This is the first show I've yet to see that takes the topic seriously (every other cartoon I've seen is overly corny) and does a damn good job with it.  

So yeah. ","1343779908"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","Would this differ from a non-gendered culture? Personally, I think our (meaning Americans and Europeans) have a high measure of gender fluidity. Other cultures, not so much, but ours do. That means though that both progressive and conservatives positions can be taken. A woman can be deeply entrenched in all the stereotypical ""female"" things and no one should have an issue with it. She would be reinforcing stereotypes merely by existing (i.e. ""girls"" do like pink, throw softly, spend large amounts of money on make-up, etc). She can embody that entire concept in a gender fluid society. It would be impossible, given this is the case to eliminate gendered phrases. We could possibly dilute them, which I also think we are doing. 

I don't know if your understanding of such a society differs from my own. I also don't know how beneficial it would be, for people that like those things naturally. I'm a relatively stereotypical guy, and while I don't feel forced into the position I'm in, I might have to go on the defensive if these stereotypes became abhorrent for some reason. Would I be mocked for my ability and choice to adhere to ""archaic"" stereotypes in the new society's eyes? Shifting things around, broadening, and restricting can all have *some* negative impact. 

On topic, I don't have an issue with your objective, but I challenge how you are trying to bring it about. You shouldn't take a position of superiority over those that *do wish they hate bigger boobs* to appear more feminine in order to be ""fair"" towards the woman that gives no consideration to her breasts because they don't embody her gender. I metaphorical minefield if I've ever seen one. 

As for policing their actions, societal pressures are strong. They have little to do with gender itself as they do what the majority is comfortable with. I obviously don't want people to act in a manner they are uncomfortable with, but I can also be against society's freedom to be uncomfortable with certain individuals. I'd rather build up the individuals comfort though. In spite of what the majority (or minority) has to say about you, you are free to act in whatever responsible/safe manner you see fit. That message should be more important than the superficial changes you've listed, although they too seek to achieve the same end goal. Think about it this way, if aren't a gender-fluid and tolerant society how do those that go against expectations manage to do so? Without support of family or friends, or society at-large they can literally thrive as individuals. That is what I want to see more of, not the safety bubble around public perceptions. 

Sorry, this got a bit ranting and mostly due to a personally issue on the issue. I do hope I was able to make some sense though. Also, I do thank you for your consideration and effort in doing what you think is right and working towards bettering society! ","1343779910"

"relationship_advice","t5_2r0cn","I would want you to tell me, no question. Are you SURE it was her husband, and are you SURE he was holding hands with another woman, and that it was romantic, not a family member? It seems odd that a husband would be walking around holding hands with his mistress in a place where he could be spotted by a family friend.  It's one thing to get caught holding hands in a private booth in a darker part of a local restaurant, but literally *walking down the street?* Why would you even walk down a street with your mistress anyway, seems like you'd be quite a bit more cautious.

I'd tell her what you think you saw, or what you saw. She'd possibly be able to rule it out being her husband if he was not at that place, or she'd be able to put the pieces together if that was a night when he supposedly had to work late or had a business dinner or something. If it's just a misunderstanding or if you were mistaken I don't see a problem. I wouldn't get mad at somebody in that circumstance, I'd appreciate them looking out for me. Now I *would* be mad if it was definitely not my husband (like if I had been with him at that precise time), yet they *insisted they knew it was him* before I told them we were together at that time, because then that person would be basically lying and I'd know their word is not trustworthy.

I don't get these people saying that because you didn't rat her out years ago you can't tell her now. Personally I struggle being friends with people who are cheating because of the very uncomfortable situation it puts friends in. It forces you to basically betray one of the people by sitting back while they're being mistreated. I would be very hurt if I knew I had even relatively close friends or family who knew my partner was cheating on me and didn't say anything--I'd find it absolutely and completely humiliating, salt in my wound. Heck, I once felt just totally devastated when I found out a guy I was just sleeping with (not even my bf) was also sleeping with a mutual coworker of ours--people knew he was sleeping with her and seeing me as well, but I really had no idea he was sleeping with her or I NEVER would have. Why would two girls work together, both sleeping with the same dude, and be all friendly and stuff like we were? It was awful.  

But anyway, in the past I was friends with a couple where I knew the husband was a completely unrepentant cheater. I had to just stop being friends with them because it made me feel like an ass to smile at this woman and pretend to be her friend when I was basically helping out her philandering husband by keeping his secret. (In that case I was not really that close to the woman, so really me telling her felt like a big case of me sticking my nose in other people's business--I was not close to her like you sound like you are with BOTH these people.)","1343779912"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I LOVE telling this story.

It must have been about 7 years ago when I was stuck on a small country road about 40 miles from my desired destination. I had ran away from a bad situation going on at my home and felt the need to get away from things for abit. I didn'thave any money for any other sort of transport, infact all I had with me was a change of clothes and a small pen knife (which i regularly carried around for general use). I was thumbing at most cars that went by not really expecting to get very far as I didn't really have any sort of experience with this sort of thing.
   Around half an hour of trying I was unexpectedly picked up by an old frail looking couple that said they would take me as close to my destination as possible as long as it was along their route. My lucky day.. These were just he type of people I wanted to get picked up by as they would prove no threat to me and were able to take me directly to my exact destination.

I cannot simply debate you to change your mind. This does not work. I have to become evil and self-destroy it from within. This is not strictly logical, it cannot be. Your ideological position is held emotionally and psychologically. In short, I need to take the place of your superego.

That's truly a wonderful quote.

In order to make money in a capitalist society one has to find out what consumers want and give it to them at a price they are willing to pay. In doing so they make their customers happy because they give them a good or service that they want at a price they can afford. They also employ people at a wage they agree on creating jobs and wealth for everyone involved. So in my opinion greed is a good thing in capitalism. You are saying that they somehow change the odds in their favor by cutting corners. If they decide to do that by trying to screw people over with lets say cutting their wages, their employees would most likely quit and find a different job that pays more. If you try to increase prices, consumers will buy a cheaper good then yours and your profits will decrease. So in a capitalist society being successful will benefit everyone around you.","1343779924"

from page 260 of the study:
&gt;Although in the
early years the magazine focused almost exclusively music and music culture, by
the 1970s its covers regularly featured an array of pop culture icons not limited to
the music world. Today the magazine is well known for its coverage of politics,
film, television, current events and, of course, popular music. Its covers generally
feature a wide range of celebrities, including comedians, actors, musicians, models,
politicians, record producers, military analysts, civil rights activists, journalists, film
directors, athletes, and more.

I doubt moving away from rock and roll has made Rolling Stone any more interested in representing women in much other than the discourse referred to in the article, but I think you're right that Rolling Stone is a reflection of what celebrities are being churned out by the political machine, Hollywood, the military complex, etc., which is why they chose the magazine.","1343779925"

As far as man in the middle attack, if you use google chrome or firebug, you can edit a page client side, then when you post the data it will post the changes. So it is only reasonable to think that a browser extension can do it also. 

That is basically my main point is that exposing the data client side, it can be manipulated client side before posting to the payment server. I don't have a dibs account, so I didn't know that you could set up your own pages and things like that. 

What all of this bases around is I found a bug similar in certain sites that use auth.net. And I was able to manipulate the data client side in such a way that I could generate a refund from the merchants account instead of a charge. It would also validate the order with the shop so they thought that I purchased goods, when in reality they just gave me a refund for the amount. It is the first payment system bug I found and got credit for. It just looks like these other are affected by the same thing. ","1343779927"

"lotro","t5_2rfus","Well, this exercise certainly reminds me of a certain bit of fantasy RPG silliness...

The value of the coins must be at least equal to the value of the underlying metal, because otherwise we'd have the current situation, where people are hoping laws regarding the destruction of currency will be repealed or altered so they can melt their old pennies for the copper. (And certainly, in LotRO, where one has reasonably easy access to forges, you could just melt your currency down anyway.)

So let's take as a reference coin the US silver dollar, which has a volume of 1.102 ml. Let's also assume an ingot of gold is about 12.4 kg (the weight of a standard gold bar in, say, Federal Reserve vaults). Gold has a density of 19.30 g/cm^3 -- meaning that a gold bar has a volume of 642.5 ml. (Excuse the strange units.) This means that, with all these definitions, we can say that, assuming perfect efficiency, you can mint about 583 coins out of a bar of metal.

In LotRO terms, then, this means that, if you could melt down your currency, a bar of copper would cost about 5s. In today's economy, that's certainly not a bad deal. On the other hand, if you could counterfeit coins, you could get about 500g from a single gold bar. So think about that next time you're in the North-downs.

Regarding this last point, the big question remaining is: who is the fiscal authority, that can issue coins such that there is a perfectly stable exchange rate between Michel Delving and Thorin's Hall, without causing terrible fiscal calamity in the economically underdeveloped Shire?","1343779928"

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I was thinking of back in the day as in the Regency period, things kind of evolved up to a social peak if you will at that point.   With the statistics you link to you have to remember to factor in widows and prostitutes into the numbers. 

 In the 16th and 17th century children of all classes were engaged to each other very young, often at birth.  The upper class would marry as young as 8 especially if it was a political/aristocratic connection but they would with stay separately at either their own house or the girl would be sent to another to act as a lady in waiting while he boy was taught lessons if there was a aristocratic connection. They would actually move in together as husband and wife from the ages of 15-17, probably depending on the girl and if she was strong enough for child birth.  The problem is that there are no reliable figures at all for the lower classes, we can say it's probable that they were married at 15 but all the books and records were written by the Upper classes who at that time couldn't give a rats arse about the poor.

  If you want a good starting point that isn't the first hits on google then a good place to start is the book [Bess of Hardwick](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bess-Of-Hardwick-First-Chatsworth/dp/0349115893/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343779846&amp;sr=8-1) which goes into great detail about how women lived in the 16th century.","1343779929"

You actually felt like an adventurer since you had to travel across many zones to get to where you wanted to go. There were so many interesting zones, creatures, and the more was really cool as well. Meeting new people was great also, I made lots of friends who I still hang out with. I didn't even put that much time in wow, it just didnt feel the same. I remember camping hours for a damn robe, camping FOREVER just to get items to drop for my epic (if you lucky enough to catch the mob still alive! DAMN Phinigel Autropos, he was so hard to catch), and then finally moving onto the planes to meet and eventually kill the gods. That was so cool.


However I eventually had to quit, the game geared itself way too much to hardcore raiding guilds. Casual players would not progress, and the gear we wore vs the difficulty of the new zones got out of hand. Unless you had top raiding gear, good luck doing anything without a group. Which towards the end of its life when wow rolled in was impossible to do.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","My husband and I had just bought each other 4th generation ipods (not even three months old at the time of this incidence). Our house had a carport and my husband's truck was literally parked less than 5 feet from our door. My husband had a horrible migraine and went into the house and laid down. Well, he was feeling so sick that he had forgotten to lock his vehicle's doors. We wake up the next morning (Easter Sunday) and wake up to find that his ipod was stolen from his truck. Well, he had his info on the ipod and even had a reward sticker on it simply for this reason. Well, we told his parents who own a gas station/pawn shop a block down the road from our house. No kidding, I could look out of the office window and easily see the store. We told them to keep an eye out for an ipod matching the description that my husband had given his mom. Sure enough, some moron kid comes in and tries to pawn it. They were the only pawn shop in the area that was open on a Sunday. Well, the dumb ass had no idea that he was trying to pawn my husband's stolen ipod to my husband's mom. She walked to the back of the store for a moment and she called the cops. The guys started freaking out when she told him that he wasn't leaving the store with the ipod and that she had called the cops. We had reported it stolen earlier so it was on record. I am sure they would have stolen mine too but my doors were locked. The douchebags (another kid helped steal it), never did get in trouble even after being caught red handed. I am glad that we got it back and if we had been given the opportunity, we would have pressed charges. There are a lot of break-ins in that area and my in-laws' store have had things stolen several times.","1343779938"

Then I quantify both the energy savings and the corresponding cost savings, estimate the cost of installing/commissioning the changes, then present it to the customer.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Grad student, yes. The theory of quantum gravity that we use is general relativity, but quantized. There is a misconception that this can't be done, but it just happens to be a problem at very very high energies. While people are looking for exactly what happens at very very high energies and trying to come up with theories at those scales and then working their way down to check if they really have a theory of quantum gravity, we look at low energies and try to figure out what is happening when the theory starts breaking down. This is called the ""effective field theory"" approach, if you want to google.

To QFT, the main ingredients are quantum mechanics and special relativity. You'll need to know very well how to work on second order differential equations (Green functions, fourier transfors, etc etc); Complex analysis is also very important; Knowing functional analysis is also useful from times to times, but not extremely necessary.

The assumption here is that the owner made a decision, either consciously or unconsciously, that the emotional distress would be greater than the pain. If they felt that the pain was greater than the emotional distress, they would not have made the decision to put their animal first. I should note that people don't always correctly assess the pain and distress, and thus may make a decision that doesn't best benefit them. But selfishness is about how the owner views it (again, consciously or unconsciously) when making the decision. ","1343779949"

So advocating models be average is unhealthy the same way advocating that models nowadays are the most beautiful women on the planet is unhealthy, because they are unhealthy.

And saying 100 years ago larger women were deemed more attractive is silly because fashion ideals changed nearly ever decade in the 20th century and continue to do so in the 21st. If you go back to the second half of the 19th century the fragile and elegant body type was in, it changes so often saying ""larger women were seen as more attractive people in the old days"" is silly.

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6","There were literally hundreds of unforgettable moments on TechTV but one of my favorites wasn't on air. It was before the channel launched when Kate Botello and I roamed around the streets of SF with a camera crew recording bits for the opening sequence of the original Screen Savers. As you might remember it was a parody of a 70s cop show. 

It was special because it was before we launched and we had no idea how it would be taken. We were naifs walking innocently into the future and it will never be the same. So much fun!

A similar moment was when we did our first personal appearance in Las Vegas. The Screen Savers was only a few months old and we didn't expect much. In fact, we had to beg TechTV to send us. Kate and I pulled up in our rental car and I remember her nails digging into my hand as she said, ""there are people here!"" We were so surprised. We signed autographs for a couple of hours and that was the beginning of an amazing run of personal appearances all over the country, each bigger than the last. 

On one, Patrick and I stayed so long that the rental company came and took down the tent and platform, but we kept on signing!","1343779955"

I mean, I'm hugely supportive of gay rights, but if you want to believe that homosexuality is wrong, that's your prerogative. It's a free country.

But when you vote to keep consenting adults from having the same happiness that you enjoy (or financially support such an endeavor), then that's an issue to me.

If you want to keep your congregation anti-gay or your denomination anti-gay, I don't believe in fighting you on that. You have the right to believe.

But when you vote to impose your religion, or your interpretation of your religion upon other people who do not share that religion, that's an issue to me.

Would you like it if people could decide whether you could get legally married or not? How would you feel about that? 

How would you feel if a Christian with a stricter interpretation than you have about the Bible were to impose his or her beliefs upon you? All of a sudden, BAM!

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Our house underwent attempted robbery a while back, while I was home with my sister and mom. My mom went outside to get something from her car and found someone casing it for an escape vehicle, I suppose (we learned the thieves had been dropped off). He gave a brief deer in the headlights look and said ""...We thought nobody was home."" So he and another guy ran back into the neighbor's fairly expansive cornfields, though they had been been harvested and were flat at the time.

I learn about all this as mom comes inside screaming to call 911, which I'm immediately doing with only moderate haste, as she's not even yelling half as loud as she is wont to do when she sees a 6-inch garden snake from 40 leagues. As I finally gather that there's an in-progress robbery, I hand the phone off to her mid-conversation and run out to the shed to make sure the guns haven't been raided yet. While the deer-rifle and shotguns were still in the locker, dad had apparently used the .22 recently and it was out (I'm the only one who de-chambers and puts away guns) and they had taken that. So I mention that to my mom, then shortly thereafter found the gun lying in the yard next to a plastic bag with some porn stolen from the tenants' place (we rent out a mother-in-law apartment over the garage). In the meantime my mom had said the word 'gun' to the police, which combined with an apparently slow day for local law officers, results in a small army of cops scouring our property in no time, who eventually found the criminals thanks to a stray dog that we proceeded to adopt and name 'Trooper' in after the first responding state troopers.

Oh yeah, the dumb part. We learned that the neighbor's house, which is a palatial estate (unlike ours, haha), was undergoing renovations or expansion or something, and they were out of town for the duration. Clearly someone in the know had tipped off some thieves that a very wealthy person's home was unoccupied and unlocked between some specific hours, and to just rob the place at their leisure. **TL;DR**, the perfect crime, wrong address, suddenly 40 cops. Also, take the guns when you're making your exit lest you commit armed robbery.","1343779974"

"politics","t5_2cneq","These are all common misconceptions about the mitigating role of risk in business which makes me think you probably don't have much experience in the business world.  When risks exceed rewards generally businesses (unless they are run by people who are incompetent or malicious) tend to not engage in whatever risky behavior is being discussed.  Whatever the reason, the end result will be a loss of profits and dissatisfaction of share holders (which we all know is the motivating force for corporations to actually reform bad practices).  At least these people aren't protected by a monolithic state with a monopoly on violence like government is.

&gt;Unless your libertarian society somehow magically turns such things into criminal murder charges leveraged inclusively through a corporation's hierarchy, all you'll do is remove the shackles of business to commit more fuck ups,

I'm not sure what you mean by the corporate hierarchy bit.  Seems irrelevant to me.  The law of the land would rule over whatever corporate hierarchy you're talking about in all cases.

&gt;the price of which will only incur itself if wronged party can actually take them to court

I can't imagine a case in which a person could not find someone to represent them if they actually had a real case.  If you don't have one then there's no legal system that can help you no matter how many regulations you have unless you write a law that says ""even if you don't have evidence that this person harmed you you can still collect damages"" which is absolutely retarded.  Now whether you pollute or not you have to pay in one form or another and if you have enough money you can circumvent the law entirely.  Tell me how that's preferable to everyone being held to the same legal standard.

You think you're so clever with your wonka smile bit but you're just making the same failed arguments with strained circular logic that I've heard a thousand times before.  It's really all the same points liberals tend to make who have an emotional connection to validation from authority in the form of government.  I get it, you think the only way any progress is ever going to be made is by using government as a weapon to further whatever agenda fits the liberal hive-mind.  I don't agree with that and I never will, period.  Real progress comes from the people, not government.

"keto","t5_2rske","Hi and welcome!

1) I don't know the answer to your question, but I just want to clarify that the sugars in wine are not sugar alcohols. Sugar alcohols are fake sugars that are added to low-carb foods like Atkins bars and low-carb ice creams. The sugars in wine are just regular sugars. I don't know how to count the carbs in the recipe you describe - I would use the full carb count for the wine just in case. 

2) Again, I want to clarify your terms. You said *sucrose* which is real sugar. You probably meant *sucralose*, which is Splenda. I just wanted to point out the difference so you'll be sure not to mix them up when you read labels. 

As for tolerance for artificial sweeteners - this varies greatly from person to person. In my case, I avoid artificial sweeteners because they make me crave real sugar and they slow down my weight loss. A lot of people drink sucralose-sweetened drinks a lot and have no problems with it. My personal advice is to avoid them at least in the beginning because it will help you lose your sugar cravings, but if you do decide to drink them, be sure to keep an eye on the pace of your loss and kick them to the curb if your loss slows or stops.

Good luck!","1343779978"

"keto","t5_2rske","I think that for traditional, i.e., non-keto diets, too much weight loss in a short span of time is unhealthy. Crash diets typically sacrifice muscle mass and water weight which is why they don't work in the long run.  Because of the metabolic changes associated with keto coupled with the fact people feel less hunger, it makes weight loss easier and faster. Plus you only see a massive drop if you are very overweight or if you are in the early stages of keto. In the first week, much of what you lose is water weight. Then the process is more sustained. If you are very over weight then you might continue losing 3-5 lbs for a couple of weeks but as you get closer to your goals a host of factors, as well as the dreaded plateau can slow your progress. 

That being said, in my experience it will take you a long time to gain back the weight you. Lose on keto when you switch to carbs. You will probably gain 5 lbs right away just by going off of keto (water weight)  but it will take a while to gain back weight in excess of that. Plus keto is really just a ticket to a healthier lifestyle. In my perspective, I don't want to eat voraciously because i will appreciate what i have accomplished.  (Not that I'm finished)

"Bass","t5_2qpc3","I am a little late to the party but I have some experience with this. I hope not to be to long in my explanation but I fear I will be as there is a lot to it. 

In 1995/6 I was on active duty in the US Army. I was in Germany in a just for fun band and we entered in a military battle of the bands competition. We didn't expect to win but we did in our local competition and then we were sent on TDY orders to compete in the Europe wide competition. After winning that one we were sent to the States on TDY orders to compete at the all Army competition were we took third place. While at this competition they select people from different bands, pull them out of their units and send them to Ft Belvior VA where you are given 30 days to learn 180 songs then off you go to places USO bands couldn't go at the time. The band is called U.S.A. Express and I believe that it is still created once a year and sent off to entertain troops all over the globe. We had to be able to play a country show, a pop show a rock show or whatever wherever we showed up. It depended on the crowd as to what we played. At the time I had done just about nothing but originals and was in way over my head at first. 


 When I got there I had a song list, a CD walkman, a note pad, copies of all of the songs on CD, a guitar, a bass and a boom box. Keep in mind all I did other than eat and sleep for three weeks was learn these songs. We also switched up instruments every now and then so a few tunes I played guitar and others I was on bass and one or two I was on the drums. 


 I took each tune and made charts as someone else mentioned, added my notes about fills or riffs that stood out or solo spots and worked on the changes. The beginning and ending of the tunes are what people really listen to and remember, what happens in the middle you can fake the funk on unless it is being driven primarily by your instrument. This is important as I am sure you already know. If you are sharp and crisp at the beginning and end the rest will fall in place.


 As a band we picked 6 tunes to go through a day to rehearse together everyday. We started with the easy songs and saved the harder tunes for later. We had to learn to play with each other as we were learning all of these songs so that made it even harder. I had to spend hours on my own skipping that POS walkman back to try to play along with some of those tunes all night long at times. After a week or so we started in on the hard songs that would need a lot of repetition and made sure we hit those at least once each day as a group. I still played them on my own whenever I could.

Break it up into sections and do chunks of it at a time. None of those look to be really difficult songs to copy. Some of them have some weird stops and timing things in them but most are pretty straight forward.
If you learn well by writing things down I would strongly suggest doing so. Not to have the notes in front of you but for the memorization from repetitive writing of the ones that you have a hard time remembering. 
When I did this it was well before you could get an iPhone or iPad. Now there are programs that will run tab or sheet music across an idevice that you can keep on the floor or tape to the back of the drummers head. Just seeing if you are still reading, lol. 
there really is nothing wrong with dropping notes on the floor or having a book of charts the go to if you need it until you memorize all the parts. I see it all the time in cover bands now. 
If you learn best by teaching write a short paragraph to your fictitious bass playing friend telling him/her how to play the tune. Make it funny and you will be able to remember the jokes and it will refresh it in your head. One of the tunes I had to learn was Plush from STP and every flipping plush animal and lush drinking joke I could think of went into a letter to a friend for me to remember those changes. Not sure why I had a hard time with that tune but I did. Timing of it I think but the letter to a friend worked for me with that one.
 Any little cheat that you can think of to remind you of the learning process for each tune will help. 

 I knew this would wind up getting long, sorry for that. I wish you the best in learning the tunes. ","1343779991"

As for the Tower of Babel, I hold that the first 7 or so chapters of Genesis are metaphorical (not to be confused with useless).  It is apparent by the style of writing.  Try reading Genesis yourself, you will see a distinct shift in style when it starts talking about Abraham.

All in all, you seem hung up on the fact that our relationship with God must be very similar to our relationship with other humans.  The reason I put the pet relationship in there was to show how the inherent difference in capabilities can change the capacity of a relationship.

All in all, my relationship with God is not supposed to look like my relationship with other humans.  How could it? 

&gt;Is God both willing and able? Then why are we debating whether or not one can have a relationship with God? Why so many different interpretations of the Bible? Why the Biblical mandate for slavery, genocide, child abuse, the subjugation of women, etc.? Why the overwhelming lack of clarity from a God who is said to want ""relationship""?!

&gt;That example of public bigotry shows what happens when secularists run the show and why secularist attempts to influence Islam must be stoutly resisted.


You are an ultra conservative religious zealot who has systematic hatred for all non Muslims and you are talking about bigotry? That is hilarious.

Face: NARS blush in Orgasm, Boots No. 7 High Lights Illuminating Lotion, Clinique Line Smoothing Concealer, Make Up For Ever HD Microfinish Powder

For nails, Zoya, China Glaze, Orly, OPI/Nicole by OPI and Essie are all really good, but are more expensive. Cheaper brands that I really like are Sally Hansen, Revlon, L'Oreal, Milani, and Rimmel. 

I'm not sure if you're looking for lip color, I just tend to use lip balm and not lipstick or gloss. I've heard really good things about Revlon's Lip Butters, I actually have a few but haven't really used them. I have Peach Parfait, Pink Truffle and Sugar Frosting. Sugar Frosting is a really frosty pink, Peach Parfait is a shimmery peach, and Pink Truffle is actually the color of my lips naturally.

What is he thinking in breaking up? He doesn't have enough romantic feelings for you in order to consider marrying you. What is he thinking in contacting you? He might not want you romantically, but he might want you as a friend. Or he might want a possibility of hooking up. Either way keeping in contact with him is going to do you some fair damage until you can get over him.

I don't know why in this society everyone is looking for a reason when they get dumped. Someone doesn't have to be moving across the country, nor do they have to have some huge concern to break up with someone.

I actually would have liked it if they had added something to that quote that misgendered her showing that it is not ok to use those pronouns (such as replacing it with [she] or putting [sic] after the wrong pronoun). 

I know that when I had only asked a handful of people to start using my preferred name and pronoun, they probably found some reasons to say them more often than they would have used my previous name/pronouns, because it's affirming and a strong reminder that someone gets it and supports you. I don't know if it's what everyone would want, as I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I know that it meant a lot to me, and still does.","1343780007"

I'm not sure what evidence you're referring to. But the question isn't whether wages equalise, it's whether globalisation equalises wages. To that end, why is 2010 or 2011 a specially important year? Did a lot of globalisation happen in those years?

We also love to alternate between piv and oral sex so as long as he hasn't orgasmed yet he can pull out and I can fellate him without any sensitivity issues.  After his orgasm he'll get sensitive and tired and then I won't be able to go anymore.

In the world we actually live in, I think it's actually kinda huge that she's out about being trans. 

&gt; I feel as though trans only really refers to the transition period

Some people feel that way, others don't. For example: I identify as female and I don't want that always to be prefixed with ""trans"", but being trans is still kind of an important aspect of my existence. It's informed my entire life experience, y'know? Not everyone has to feel the way I do about it, but your comment feels like an unintended, but very real erasure of her identity. 

Basically, being a trans woman is like being a tall woman, or a Chinese woman: it's an adjective, it denotes a seperate experience cluster. All three are women, but they have different experiences of that.

that said, there are a couple of companies in my portfolio for reasons of sentimentality and i will be buying these stocks on that premise. i love man united and would love to take ownership over some of it. plus, whatever you think of the glazers, its united i love more and buying its stock will only help lower the debt as the mre people buy the more likely the price will rise.

advice for those wishing to follow suit: when buying any stocks, purchase 'puts' as well. not many do this but it saves you a lot of stress. you can do this with any broker. without going into too much detail, a 'put' is a form of 'option' (financial instrument) that allows you to 'hedge' against the stock falling too far and wiping out your investment. it is insurance. after all, you wouldnt buy housing without insurance would you? buying insurance on a house is a mere form of 'put', the same as buying a 'put' on a stock.

by all means, ask me  for advice or else google will do the trick for you!

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; I'm asking how this would be possible if the two things were truly opposed to each other.

because people are good at dissociating their skill sets. When A scientitist is in church he leaves his reason at the door and does not ask how it can be so. 

When the same scientist is in the lab ""god did it"" is never an acceptable answer. God is never factored into the equation. when doing science the scientist acts as if there is no god, because the moment he allows god into his science he has stopped doing science. 

&gt; Sort of like how you can believe in science without believing in every theory that has ever come along. 

but some theories are non negotiable. You really can't contribute to biology if you reject the theory of evolution. You really can't contribute to geology if you reject plate tectonics. And your really can't call yourself a Christian if you reject the theory of original sin, as without it the rest of the dogma becomes incoherent. ","1343780030"

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt;According to whom? If you don't consider Jim to be counted as a human, as some whites once considered blacks, then you wouldn't have the same status as moral actors.

Objectively speaking, of course!  Why did whites consider blacks to be of a different status?  Partly because they believed that they were genetically flawed or of a different species but we can know, objectively, that this isn't true.  Therefore, there was no reason to consider people of different races as having different statuses.  

&gt;No, they mean what the speaker considers to be good, bad, moral, immoral. That's still an important meaning.

No, simply put, the meaning of these words then become trivial.

&gt;Right. We can still meaningfully state that we personally consider that it was wrong for Hitler to kill those people. Is your argument that you just don't like the conclusion?

That is not my argument at all.  The fact is, and if would dispute this I don't know where we can find much common ground, it can be said that the Holocaust was, objectively, an immoral action (on any grounds of objective moral theory).

As for the need to reconcile the belief in objective morality with the non-belief in God, I don't see this as a problem at all.  Whether or not someone believes in the existence of one or any Gods, that is not a prerequisite for believing in objective morality.  There are plenty of ways to work your way to objective morality without presupposing the existence of a God.  

Now, it's time for you to answer some of my questions!

1.  If the definition of an action as good, bad, moral, immoral is on dependent on the sentiment of the actor, how are those words no longer trivial?

2.  If the meaning of wrong and right are dependent on the actor, how are you ever able to criticize the actions of others that you yourself deem immoral?

3.  Hamburgers or hot dogs?

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","I look at it this way, my wage as a high school student and gas station attendent in the mid 1970s was about $3.50. In my junior and senior year I become a sometime mechanic and bumped my wages up to a little over $5/hr.  If I hadn't used that money and some debt to get a college education (the only person from senior class to do so btw) I'd still, 40 years later, be earning about the same.  Important point here- I paid my way through college through a combination of starvation and lots of hours....  Today, had I not gone to college, at best I might be earning 2x that amount.  Instead, as a result of education, luck and work I'm earning about 40x that amount. 

Is that income difference a result of a rational redistribution which might result from a scarcity of my skills, increases in my productivity or an increased demand for my services? Partially, perhaps but at least some of difference be caused by deliberate actions on my or my government's part to suppress the demand for or worth of those lower skilled positions. 

Stagnation of education and crime rates (and subsequent records) are part of the differences but have we deliberately set up a situation where the services those sort of people can provide are deliberately devalued?   People in those positions have no security, no health care, greatly reduced educational options and higher birth rates, rates of violence and incarceration.  

My taxes pay for all those things- I'd rather the money went to those employed at the bottom end of things- to provide health care and education (for them and everyone else at the same level regardless of income) and if the cost of their services rose that might be fine too- it would increase the DIY segment of the population and reduce the incentive of people to devote themselves to work (at the expense of their own and societies well being) because would no longer be as good a ROI to buy the services of this ""underclass"".  

The underclass don't have healthcare, they don't get police protection, they don't get adequately educated and more than anything else, they tend to replicate their own dismal existence dragging down all of society.  I don't think they ""deserve"" more, I just think it would benefit society overall to redirect their activities toward more productive things and main way to do this is to give them an incentive to work.  When I'm going to be getting $10.00 and hour which isn't enough to pay for an apartment, an education, a car and the other things our society has mandated are necessary, what is the incentive to work? 

Your point is valid but those at the bottom of society do not receive the benefits you speak of.  I'm not saying that any person, without investing in skills should expect constant wage increases, but rather that the money (in the economy) is going somewhere- just not to the same set of things and people as it used to and as result the people who are stuck where I was, or staring out are well and truly fucked.

I am 100%, not trying to make the argument that men do not desire/need love, and that women do not need/desire respect.  I was merely stating a fact, as stated in Ephesians that women need love, and men need respect from their respective spouses.  If this were not the case, then God would not have inspired the author of Ephesians to say as much.

I am not going to speak on behalf of women, but I know that men (in general) have rather large, and rather fragile ego's.  When their spouse disrespects them, especially in public, it can be very detrimental to a man (in general).

Now, I am of course not making the argument that disrespecting a women is not detrimental to them.

Teleport actually allows him to push two lanes at once. If you use it correctly, when you know for a fact that the enemy is coming for you (and you are certain they can't see you teleport and in effect they double back), you will leave them running after a ghost.

Alternatively, I use it on a lot of solotop champions, because you want to stay in lane and farm pretty much 24/7. Not only does it minimize your downtime, but I also use its cooldown as an indication as to when I can go back: I only return voluntarily when my teleport is up.

That being said, I hope you realize how limited its use is. While a spell like flash can be used in a wide variety of occasions, on virtually any champion, teleport simply isn't the right spell for a lot of champions. It's not a bad spell, on the contrary: it's a great spell, but only on a handful of champs.","1343780047"

Isn't there a scene later when they tell Rose at the table and there's a similar joke?  I remember thinking it was hilarious, even though I didn't totally understand it.  I think because all the characters delivered it so perfectly :).  Then several years later I watched Ellen Degeneres on The Rosie O'Donnell Show promoting her sitcom, and when Rosie asked Ellen about what was coming up for the character, they did the whole ""We find out that she's Lebanese"" thing!  And Rosie O'Donnell even says ""I might be Lebanese!"" and that was years before she actually came out.  So, um, yeah, I'm always a fan of this joke!

Straight people can currently be married and receive these government benefits but gay people can't. That is the only issue.

They really were on a Polish holy site, and reporters and journalists need to show a little more tact than screaming questions at him. I'm against the suppression of questions that the Romney camp has been guilty of, but there are two reasons why the reporters were in the wrong here. 
1) Respect. No one who visits the tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States is allowed to talk, or scream anything at all, so why should that respect not be shown towards similar places abroad. 
2) It wasn't going to be effective, yelling out questions. Did they seriously think that Romney after avoiding questions for a week, was suddenly going to address them and spill all? 

Again, folks, I'm not a Romney supporter in the least, but I've studied and practiced enough journalism to know that what happened there was not completely Gorka's fault. He may have over reacted with his profanity, which it appears he apologized for, but I believe something had to be said.

They still hold onto to many different parts of christian theology and dogma, just far less than most other 'christian' churches.

Frankly, I think they would be better off if they dropped the Christianity. Sure, teach that certain things Jesus said are good, but why focus exclusively on Jesus/the Bible?

"Music","t5_2qh1u","somethimg i mention everytime this comes up...

the music industry was never really in the music business.  they were in the advertising, manufacturing, and distribution business.

technology made things like printing tons of cd inserts, building brick and mortar stores, not to mention the cost of diesel, trucks, tires, drivers, etc, all irrelevant.  they had monopolies because artist xyz didnt have access to the millions of dollars in unfrastructure they built up over the years.

social media made their advertising irrelevant.

their executives either didnt even have email, or were having their assistants printing their emails for them while napster was decimating the distribution part of their business.

not only did they not understand what was going on, but they literally didnt know who to ask.  its a little like if your neighbor started talking to themselves in ancient sumerian.  you couldnt hear them through the walls, but even if you did you wouldnt understand what they were saying, let alone know what language it was to ask the right friend to translate for you.

same thing happened with kodak.  they thought they were in the photography business.  rim thought they were an enterprise messaging company.  companies and industries get into an incestuous corporate culture where there are so many rules, players, and billions of dollars in infrastructure that theyre totally inflexible and refuse to budge until the rug is pulled out from under them.

these guys were powerful.  they killed dance music in the us for 30 years and turned it into a joke in our culture because those artists wouldnt play ball.

someone does need to curate artists and drive pop culture, and i think this is where they can recover.  average people simply dont want to think for the,selves and discover music on their own.  nothing against them, but as an analogy i have no interest in diversifying my wine pallette.

She always seems to have that mocking tone, she shows up the Doctor and how he drives the Tardis, expects the Doctor to always come running and eventually thinks that her needs are more important than *the entire universe*. *Maybe* I would let that slide if they showed her doing something particularly impressive, but through the show all she seems to do is:

* Die in *Silence in the Library / Forest of the Dead*
* Not defeat the Weeping Angels in *The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone*
* Bullies a fat guy, tricks some fake Romans and can't stop the Tardis from exploding in *The Pandorica Opens*
* Makes a Dalek beg for mercy, *without* showing a good reason why in *The Big Bang*
* Fails to save the Doctor in *The Impossible Astronaut*, only showing the reason why much later
* Kills some Silents in *Day of the Moon*, which Canton showed isn't very hard
* I'll admit, almost killing the Doctor and fighting Nazi in *Let's Kill Hitler* was fairly impressive, but she was basically a villain in that episode so it's not something to praise her about
* Thinks she's more important than the rest of the universe in *The Wedding of River Song*

I don't like it when the Doctor is arrogant either, but at least he's got nearly 50 years of adventure behind him so that we know he's done impressive things. *Villains* are the ones that are supposed to come in and lord themselves over the Doctor, not the heroes.","1343780070"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","&gt;The only way I would buy music, is if a service similar to Steam existed. Meaning, all my music stays organized in a nice library. If I format my computer, I just fire up the app, and click the albums I previously purchased to redownload. At the same time, sales, lots of sales. I'd like to visit their site, and see a 75% off sale, meaning a $1-5 album for some interesting music. In that way, I'm not really paying for the music, but the ability to have it organized (all the artwork, correct file names, tags, lyrics, etc), and the ability to not worry about backups, since I can just redownload my entire library with the push of a button. Steam has a nice social aspect as well. It would be nice to have something similar to chat with other music loves, build a friend list, etc. We could use something similar for movies as well. Buy movies, they go into your virtual library. Download, redownload, or stream them in any common resolutions. However, this would never work, too many people are inbetween the buyer and the creator, and they all want a piece of the pie.

It is arrogant to ""Play God,"" yea, but i say, ""so what.""  And that's what george Carlin is saying here. He's not telling us to NOT save the planet, he's just reminding us that the reason we do it is to save ourselves, and not some other altruistic duty.

Edit:

Two of my favorite passages:

&gt;“When the wind was in the north you could hear them, the horses and the breath of the horses and the horses’ hooves that were shod in rawhide and the rattle of lances and the constant drag of the travois poles in the sand like the passing of some enormous serpent and the young boys naked on wild horses jaunty as circus riders and hazing wild horses before them and the dogs trotting with their tongues aloll and the foot-slaves following half naked and sorely burdened and above all the low chant of their traveling song which the riders sang as they rode, nation and ghost of nation passing in a soft chorale across that mineral waste to darkness bearing lost to all history and all remembrance like a grail the sum of their secular and transitory and violent lives.”

and

&gt;""He spoke of his campaigns in the deserts of Mexico and he told them of horses killed under him and he said that the souls of horses mirror the souls of men more closely than men suppose and that horses also love war. Men say they only learn this but he said that no creature can learn that which his heart has no shape to hold.""","1343780078"

Yeah, they vary in height and color, but really look at them. Not only that, but who are they to define beauty, you know? To me this campaign says “If you are the size of the average human being you count as REAL BEAUTY. Nothing more, Nothing less.” To me these ads come off as companies attempting to preach about self love and how everyone is beautiful, but sticking to the same basic body type and failing miserably.","1343780079"

Put probes on all 3 channels: CS, Clock and SDO.  Trigger on CS, falling edge.  Adjust the time span so that can see an entire two byte sequence, including CS going low and then high again (somewhere around 40 us, since you have a 1 MHz clock)

This is [wacky](http://www.insideline.net/1999/xiques-0910-99.html) rigged, also [this](http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;qe=d2Fja3kgcmlnZ2VkIA&amp;qesig=jw3XUjcm206AqipFi66oMQ&amp;pkc=AFgZ2tmbKk_1vn7mTi6K2bnOIlf52Dqt-b-Xli63xPjHFCbHPoEpUum-Q3Zjusn7KiudnJcOXpI-c4FMgaRb5o9tOWBvuwXH0A&amp;pq=wacky%20rigged&amp;cp=13&amp;gs_id=1j&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=wacky+rigged+senko&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=wacky+rigged+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=f21b051823c48b05&amp;biw=1279&amp;bih=605). It's just a hook(Wide gap hooks or circle hooks are best) and the senko, hooked in the middle of the senko. That's it. For some resin bass love it and you will for sure catch fish on it. Now I fish it like so, cast it out(on a ledge where bass are holding or just in semi deep water) and let it sink until you have slack line, it might take a minute because it isn't weighted, and then jig it up a couple times. Do that until you catch a bass pretty much. In my experience bass will hit it on the fall(as they do with most baits) and when you twitch it up you will feel it on there so just set the hook and reel in your fish. also the 4'' senkos work best for me. This won't work too good when its windy and the water is choppy because the bait won't fall right so I suggest when it is windy and a little overcast and choppy to throw a spinner bait that is natural colors, strike king, booyah and terminator are good brands.

"history","t5_2qh53","&gt;Polish invasion of Russia in 1919, when the Bolshevik revolution was most vulnerable. Stalin was a bolshevik commander in Poland back in 1920.

I think you mixed something up here, that was an invasion of Poland by Soviet Russia... The Red Army was planning to follow the retreat of the German army until the Vistula (in the middle of Poland). The Polish army engaged them in February 1919 near Grodno to prevent further advance towards Warsaw. The red army was eventually stopped at the gates of Warsaw in late 1920, and the war ended.

It's honestly the first time I hear of a Polish invasion of Russia in 1919.

Russians may have wanted a payback for the invasions of Moscow around 1610 though. 

However the most probable explanation is that they simply wanted the Germans to do a large part of the job they had already done in Wilno (now known as Vilnius), and had to finish themselves in the rest of the country in order to take it over : killing all members of the AK. The Warsaw uprising was a controversial decision among commanders of the Polish resistance in Warsaw, as it was already known to them that all members of the AK who fought with the Red Army against the Wehrmacht in Wilno had been executed by the Russians after the battle.

Nearly all of my experiments are done at the [Spallation Neutron Source](http://neutrons.ornl.gov/images/SNS_aerial_640.jpg) at Oak Ridge National Lab or [NIST'S Center for Neutron Research](http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/jobs/GenGuideHall.JPG) near Washington DC.

I can play marine/tank in TvT just fine vs mid-high master players, but that's purely because of my macro, I still end up with 3 fax tanks in the lategame because my marine micro sucks balls.

edit: And TvZ win rates are pretty bad from what I can tell, so I guess marine/tank isn't all that strong anymore anyway (mainly due to the maps I'd guess and obviously patches aswell.) so for me there doesn't seem to be much of a point in going back to marine/tank and practise my marine micro when zerg seems to have the upperhand at the moment, I'd rather stick to Mech because I have so much more experience with that.

"Minecraft","t5_2r05i","The Good: 

-You voice is good, it doesn't sound like a screeching 12 year old.

-Your mic/voice quality was good, I didn't hear any echo.


The Bad:

-The minecraft sounds sounded like they were being played from your speakers and then being picked up by your mic. Try to find some recording software that records your computer audio, and then wear headphones. This will make your all around video sound much better.

-Maybe edit out the boring parts. The first two minutes of you crouching your way to the castle were boring. Either talk about something interesting perhaps or just cut it out completely. For example do your welcome intro thing when you are right outside the castle. The castle part was pretty fun to watch.

-Record in HD please. 720 p is what you want.

-Record in 16:9 screen size, none of this square shit.

Yet by cherry picking a tiny proportion of (mostly male) deaths and comparing it to a larger number of female deaths by male hands the picture feels right to say it is evidence of a ""War on Women"".

The figures I posted about male suicide were to show how meaningless a ""comparison of numbers dead"" is as a basis for claiming there is a war on a whole gender.

Lets not forget that 2 years worth of FEMALE sucides out number that decade plus total of male's killing their female partners. Of course you can't use those figures because that would imply that the ""War on Women"" was being waged by women through the act of suicide, when the goal is obviously to twist figures to show that men are waging a war on women.

The person who made the initial piece obviously started with the title ""War on Women"" then went looking for pieces of information they could twist to supposedly prove such a thing existed.

Taking suicide out entirely though, men kill more men than women, women kill more men than women.

If there is a ""War on Women"" then it isn't being carried out very well.","1343780110"

"exmormon","t5_2r0gj","This sort of thinking always bothered me. You see the same sort of thing doctrinally, when you hear lessons on obedience or other ""hard"" commandments. You see, if you CHOOSE to obey God's commandments, you are free, but if you wander away and start sinning, the devil has ensnared you and you find yourself becoming less free, because your sin will entice you to sin more, and you become a slave to your sinful nature, instead of the master of your impulses, which you would be through obedience to God's commandments. It's like being a drug addict: sinning is a drug and you find yourself  enslaved because you feel like you can't stop sinning.

Whereas by choosing to be obedient, your bonds are loosened and you have more freedom, because you can choose obedience over sin. 

It always seemed like weird, circular logic to me. What good is freedom if you can only choose one option?

But it's the same sort of thinking your grandfather has. The country is only truly free as long as it is obedient to Christian principles. As it falls away from those Christian principles, Satan's grip over the country grows stronger and although there is the guise of freedom and choice, the truth is that the nation's people will be in bondage because of sin and iniquity.","1343780113"

"politics","t5_2cneq","**TL;DR**:  The recession of 1929, the government's response to it, and the resulting Great Depression are very similar to the economics of today.

&gt;I do see the US response to the depression of 1929 Caused by unregulated financial markets, and ignited by multiple banking failures (sound familiar)

""Unregulated financial markets"" - I assume you're talking about the stock market crash.  This crash was caused by the unsupportable high participation of margin purchases (stocks bought on debt).  When stock prices fell a little, it triggered margin calls that forced more selling, that triggered more margin calls...  The stock market crash was indeed a debt event.

The banking failures of the same time period were caused by banks lending out a much too high percentage of their assets.  When depositors wanted to take some of their money out, they couldn't.  This produced another cycle which quickly lead to many bank failures.  Again, this was a debt event.

&gt; it languished under ""laissez faire"" replies

Not really.  At no point did government spending fall.  It stayed flat in constant dollars, and increased significantly in deflation adjusted dollars.  Government spending increased quite drastically from the first year and accelerated right up to the end of World War Two.  At no point in that time did the monstrous spending result in an improved economy.

&gt; FDR unleashed the power of Keynsian economics.

FDR popularized the disastrous debt fueled spending binge by giving it a shiny new brand name.  He marketed The New Deal.  FDR's New Deal did not accelerate spending any more that was happening before it.  FDR didn't create anything new.  He just branded the same old lie with a snazzy name.

&gt;This massive wealth creation is not only responsible for the majority of the infrastructure that made this country the greatest in the world 

Maybe you can argue that this spending made us ""great"".  But can you argue that it ended the depression.  The more that was spent in the name of The New Deal, the worse things got.

&gt;However, around 1937 people obsessed with the free market myth began to require ""austerity""

There was [very consistent increases in spending](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2013/assets/hist01z1.xls).  1937 and 38 had slight decreases in spending, but still both years were much higher than per-stimulus spending rates.

There was NEVER a policy of austerity during the recession of 1929 or the Great Depression.

&gt;This dampened the recovery - without austerity economics, the great depression (starting in 1929) would have been overcome purely by Keynsian principles applied judiciously

Stimulus spending began in 1929 and decelerated throughout The Great Depression.

Keynsian principles might have some value.  Unfortunately, this model requires the government to pay off debt and reduce spending during good times.  As the recession of 1929 approached, the federal government was already spending heavily and already burdened by significant debt.","1343780114"

"SRSDiscussion","t5_2t5sa","That's fantastic, I'm a firm believer that students learn much better when the topics are relevant to their lives.  It's also great that your sister has the flexibility to teach about these topics.

The U.S. educational system is currently (and has been) moving towards standards based learning.  There are a lot of interesting debates and opinions on whether it is a good idea or not.  But one thing that critics point out is that our students' educational experience becomes rather watered down, because there is less room to teach about topics that aren't on the standardized tests.  In a country the size of the U.S. this becomes a problem, because the cultural experiences of a student from rural Alabama are going to vary drastically from someone who grew up in NYC.

With that being said, there is still room for tailored instruction, even within the standards.  I'm from Detroit, Michigan which is a great case study into race relations.  When discussing the Civil Rights Movement of the '50s and '60s, I can teach about ""white flight"" through the lens of Detroit.  This makes it way more valuable of an experience for the students because they are able to learn about a very loaded and important topic by connecting it to their own experience.  It goes from ""Why aren't there many white people left in Detroit?"" to, ""I understand the causes and reasons why there aren't many white people left in Detroit.""

"gifs","t5_2qt55","&gt;as a guy, it's hard to imagine what non-negative traits separate me from neutral gender

There's a Jewish funeral practice called [Keriah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiva_\(Judaism\)#Keriah) where mourners ritually tear their clothing. I remember an autobiography where the author is _furious_ that her parents, who can barely afford their meals, still participate in Keriah and waste money replacing their clothes. She couldn't understand why.

After thinking about it for a long time, I realized that the cost of Keriah buys knowledge of who is a ""good Jew."" Arguably, if someone is unwilling to sacrifice ritually, they will ""defect"" in other contexts, e.g. collaborate with oppressive authorities in exchange for protection.

In any situation where there's one best course of action, all _possible_ in-group signals are negative. When everyone acts ""rationally,"" making the obvious choices, it's too hard to tell factions apart.

So whenever the genders act as warring factions, their negative traits get exaggerated instinctively. Hence macho posturing, and ""bros before hos,"" among other things. Signaling maleness is _worth_ self-destruction and casual harm to women, if you have certain goals.

I don't think this effect is the _dominant_ force behind that 4chan post, but it's there. I see the poster assuming that men and women are in conflict, that men therefore need to stick together, and that the female strategy he's describing is prevalent and influential.

Clay Shirky's [Rant About Women](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/) is a good example of a (positive?) gender trait detached from this dynamic, but be sure to read [this comment](http://www.shirky.com/weblog/2010/01/a-rant-about-women/#comment-2727), because it's almost definitely still cultural. I suspect the biological sexes differ only in statistical tendencies, like the 4:1 male to female ratio of autism.

_(Woah, I spent too long thinking about this. I focus on male signals above because as a male I notice them more readily. If you notice any other biases, please point them out to me. I aim to be consequentialist and egalitarian.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Its not really the same thing here though. Math is a different kind of abstraction because you are discussing things that can't necessarily be run nor stored in a computer, so paper and ideas are all we have. This doesn't mean its useless, as many of the more abstract mathematical concepts are very important in other sciences. 

How does one discuss ""smoothness"" in a discrete world? How does one discuss continuous functions in physics where there is no such thing as discrete measurements in the physical world? What about irrational numbers? How about an uncountably infinite set? A set with infinite elements is not necessarily uncountably infinite. Think of integers vs. real numbers here.

Sets are not things that have X number of elements in them necessarily. A set can be a set of functions. I am not really familiar with functional programming languages but to my knowledge there is no way to define something like a ""Set of square integrable functions"" in it and this class of functions is important for certain models people have made in physics.

Most of the programming language topics you are discussing sound to me like they are designed for making your code readable by a machine. Human beings are more flexible than that. We can work with abstract concepts a machine won't even be able to replicate (yet). Furthermore, proving something with an algorithm doesn't bring quite the same understanding as proving it in a mathematical proof, and vice verci, but both are ways to do it.

I never had a problem understanding math notation, I HAVE had trouble understanding the concepts but that's pretty normal. Like I said I have some programming experience mostly in Java, C++ and C#. I am not a stellar programmer by any means but I do program numerical methods for various problems. I suppose in the end its whatever you understand the most, I just really don't think there would be any way to replace all math notation with something like a programming language because a programming language is ill-suited to certain kinds of math. Most of these are not ""historical"" either, as people are discovering new things that trickle outward. An example is wavelets, which are exploding right now in their usage in computer vision it seems like.","1343780129"

I don't advise jumping into these if you're just beginning, because of the cost, but they're the best shoes I've ever worn. have lasted me just over 2 months so far and the only signs of wear are a couple of grazes here and there, and the grip is visibly ""used"", as the very small parts of grip at the front have worn down slightly.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","Besides my own thought that adding citations to claims makes a list like this *way* more convincing to those outside the MRM, there are a few points that I'm unsure of regardless:

I need men’s rights because ... I will make less money than my female contemporaries;

I need men’s rights because a man’s appearance, height, and weight has a greater affect on his income income than it does for a woman;

I need men’s rights because the likelihood of my death coming by suicide is four times higher than it is for women, though I receive little support; - In my research, I found that while successful suicides are overwhelmingly men, suicide attempt statistics are not well determined

I need men’s rights because broad gender-wide slurs against men are socially acceptable; - this seems a little unfair, as many slurs have become either mostly meaningless, or have been matched with female equivalents (i.e., dick/bitch, or pig/slut)

I need men’s rights because it is fine to call me a “dick”, a “cock”, or a “prick” on the street or on television; a woman must never be called a “cunt”; - This is fairly similar to the previous one, but I must point out that many slurs are received differently in different places. For example, while ""cunt"" is absolutely unacceptable here in America, in Britain it is thrown around much more casually. 

I need men’s rights because my sexuality is routinely characterized as violent pathology, rather than as a natural part of my human identity; - I'll be honest, I'm not entirely sure what you're referring to here;

I need men’s rights because I believe that the feminist idea that a woman in the United States is equally oppressed as a woman in Afghanistan or Saudi Arabia in cruel and insulting; - I'll be honest, I've never heard this argument be made seriously. I've heard people pointing it out as a way to frame other people's complaints as first-world problems, but I've never heard of any feminists claiming that they have it just as bad as women in the middle-east. 

I need men’s rights because I have the right to associate with other men without legal action forcing me to allow women, too; -  I've heard stories of this happening, but I couldn't find any through google. 

Please keep in mind that the only reason I'm criticizing this article so much is because I think it is really good, and I'd love to use it as a resource. However, people tend to be lazy, and I know that people are gonna just dismiss this out-of-hand if they don't see any relevant links supporting each point. The work you do is great, so I'm pretty confident that each point is true, but your writing is wasted if it's only read by those who already agree.

There were no app stores, no music stores, and apps were 5-10$ each.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Yes.  Your mouse and keyboard control your PC, and your PC outputs to your monitors; as far as the PC is concerned it just has more room to work with - move your mouse to the right of your left-most monitor, it'll go to the right-most monitor.

To jump on to your other question of why: It simply boils down to having more room to work with; and with separate monitors you essentially have 'boundaries' in your workspace that you can use (which you can emulate with software, but it's not as nice) - i.e. a maximized window or game, for instance, would only take up one screen.  Multi-monitor configs are really quite common in the general demographic of heavy PC users (gamers, programmers, media producers), as they dramatically improve productivity; it's basically the same as how somebody would work on a desk: you have materials that you need to use so you lay them out so they're all visible and accessible; on a small desk you might be a bit cramped, and have materials overlapping eachother - so you need to constantly swap which is on top (alt+tab on a PC), but if you have a large desk you can lay out all your materials so you can easily see them, they don't overlap eachother and they're easily accessible.

Some people prefer larger monitors to get this extra space, but a lot of people, and I'd argue the majority - prefer extra monitors.  I prefer extra monitors for two primary reasons:  The boundaries they give, both in terms of OS-level window organisation, and physically - being able to throw two 16:10 monitors side-by-side for a 16:5 aspect ration (so everything is on a comfortable height, just along the width), than having to buy a much larger monitor, or TV, for similar workspace gain - but with an increase both in width and height; and the second reason - for the expandability, if I ever end up needing even more space - it's easy to buy a third-monitor to add than having to throw out my single-monitor and buying an even larger single-monitor.","1343780135"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Norway is the second wealthiest country in the world. It has the largest per-capita capital monetary reserve and second highest per-capita GDP of any other country...  thanks mostly to oil from the north sea. Norwegians have a rooted cultural identity, common value systems, and a government that reflects both. 

America is extremely diversified and historically successful due to emphasis on individual liberties and freedoms from government controls. 

Comparing America to Norway is like comparing Apples to Hamsters...

Norway distributes it's wealth among the general population in the form of laws that ensure plentiful benefits and a high quality of life for the entire population. There's no reason to become a criminal.. Everyone lives comfortable lives regardless of the effort they put forth. America doesn't have near the natural resources to exist the way Norway does.

The suggestion that we simply implement the wrong style of prison in order to generate wealth rather than spend a little extra demonstrates a tremendous lack of international perspective.

When I say long time it could easily be 12 hours (minimum). The fact that the body was removed so quickly means  more then likely the investigating authorities believed it to be a suicide. 

I am guessing prior to this you have never seen a body that has fallen from a great height. I have seen quite frankly more then I really want to count and I can tell you that there are so many factors that go into blunt force trauma from falling a great height you really can not speculate what the condition of the body will look like. 

When you throw in the fact that the media has discontinued covering the event it more then likely means a post-mortem investigation has been conducted and the manner of death has been ruled suicide. ","1343780138"

"Games","t5_2qhwp","In my opinion, a game is ""worth it"" when the # of hours played = # of dollars spent. There are a few exceptions, when the experience is so phenomenal that it leaves the player with a lasting impression, like with me and Red Dead Redemption, but I'll only discuss my ""highest ratio"" games.

*Minecraft: $20, &gt;220 hours.* I tend to pick it up, obtain some really good resources after spelunking in a few caves, then quit. I like securing resources and making practical structures, but I'm no good with building monoliths. After taking a break, I get back into it. And so the cycle repeats. I can imagine putting much more time into this game over the next few years.

*Battlefield Bad Company 2: $35, ~200 hours.* The multiplayer for this game was fantastic. Sure, a match had a maximum of 24 players, but DICE really knew how to condense the action. Too bad they kind of botched that in Battlefield 3, where the maps were either too huge and empty, or too linear. 

*Monster Hunter Tri: $30-40, ~180 hours.* Even thinking about this game makes me want to play more. I may have fought the Rathian over fifty times as a Lower Rank, but it was worth it to get the Plate (3% drop rate) to forge the complete set of Rathian Armor. Unfortunately, the only thing holding me back from picking the game up again is the lengthy process of finding a good hunting party. ","1343780139"

"hockey","t5_2qiel","**Why they will:** New coaching staff with more offensively focused type of play. Additions of Hudler, Cervenka and baertschi will give us some more offensive strength. Kipper has another good year with irving playing backup more often. Getting rid of Jokinen and moss will also help to change the line-up enough it starts to feel like a new and younger team instead of the same one that continuously misses the playoffs. 

**Why they won't:** Iggy and Kipper are getting old, if kipper doesn't play his best (which usually happens after he has a good season) then we'll pretty much be left out to dry with our inexperienced goalies and very average defence, or the new coach doesn't work out and the flames fail to mesh with the new additions and finish low in the league.","1343780145"
"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Language is a mode of communication, nothing more. Communication's main focus is to transfer ideas from an individual to one or more others. If understanding is there, then the rules don't matter. Indeed much humor is based on this fact (including the entirety of puns and plays-on-words).

To set rigid, unchanging rules to communication is as non-sensical as setting rigid, unchanging rules for any other field of expression. Art would eventually die out if that happened. Fields like programming and engineering which are only bounded by their respective sciences would eventually see the cessation of technological improvement.

In the end, mutual understanding should be the only thing that rules communication. If some people only learned by memorization, and hate the thought of having to re-memorize rules, that's their problem and a flaw in their education. To stunt the fluidity of something so beautiful precisely because of its ephemeral nature, well that's just selfish and short-sighted.

The only problem I can see with this is that in the future, they won't understand our dead languages, which are so different from theirs. All i can ask is: just like we don't understand Latin, which our language descended from, much like theirs would descend from ours?

**TL;DR** Fuck haters of popular-usage, language should be driven by that since its ultimate goal is popular-understanding.","1343780145"

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt; The reason people write academic papers is not to express their opinions but to develop what they know and expand on it. Among those who have studied economics, there is very little disagreement, as there shouldn't be.

In economics, the Austrian School (which is the school of economic thought adhered to by most libertarians) is considered to be a heterodox, non-mainstream school of thought. It is rejected by a vast majority of academic economists, and in turn rejects a number of essential concepts in mainstream economics.

And we're not talking about small things here. For example, the Austrian school largely rejects mathematical economics, econometrics, statistics, experiments, empiricism and the use of the scientific method in economics. Another good example is that many Austrian-leaning economists reject the idea of market failure in virtually all circumstances.

Meanwhile, Austrian ideas like the Austrian Business Cycle Theory, malinvestment as the sole cause of bubbles, and praxeology are rejected by all but a few mainstream economists.

[Here's an overview of just some issues with Austrian economics.](http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/whyaust.htm) Note that the author is himself a former Austrian, as well as a professor at George Mason University (the main stronghold of Austrian/libertarian economics in the US), a fellow at the Cato Institute and the Mercatus Center, and a self-described anarcho-capitalist. So he is about as sympathetic to the Austrian School as it gets, yet his disagreements with it still comprise a sizable list.

I had visited her son about 15 or 20 years before. She walked in. I was totally fried on some excellent weed. She asked for her son. At work or something.

Then she asked if I was ""stoned."" I was having trouble standing up, so  I copped to it. Then she said, ""good, if anyone can tell me about anal sex, you can.""

"photography","t5_2qh2a","Learning lightroom is all about playing.  Make half a dozen versions (create virtual copy) of the same image.  Go do something else for a while.  Come back and pick the ones you like.  Figure out what you did with those.

Take any settings you like, and save the presets.  When you do your next image, mouse over them and look at the preview.  At the very least, it's a very, very quick way to see what a lot of different settings will look like.  Sometimes you'll be surprised by what works.

Generally, less is more; you want most of your work done when you hit the shutter.  LR should be like putting on the green.  Just a nice firm tap to get it where it needs to be.

Overall, the more you play/mess with it, the better you get.  You'll learn fast.

I don't think your post work is much of an issue.  The big problem is softness.  Get a real lens that works with your camera body.  I understand you use it for video, but a cheap point and shoot with a hot-shoe would be way better than what you've got going.  You can't expect to do paid work when you don't have the appropriate gear.  Getting the kit zoom lens would be fine for your body.  Otherwise, any of the into-level DSLRs from Nikon or Canon would also work well.  The bodies really don't matter much, unless you're doing action or big prints; the lenses matter.  If you want to get serious about still photography, you need access to the best lenses.  Remember that glass retains its resale value very well, and there's a huge used market available for you to take advantage of.

The lighting and background need some work, too, but that's fixed by sticking to the basics and getting practice.  Plenty has been written about that, so just do some googling and wrangle a friend to be your guinea pig.","1343780153"

"CFB","t5_2qm9d","PJ is one of the true 'guru' coaches at the D-I level.  Others would be June Jones, Mike Leach, Rich Rod, and Nick Saban (defense) as examples of people who are truly masters of what they do.

As far as GT's fanbase, I dunno, I always had the impression ya'll were a little... different... down there?

Success breeds opportunity and PJ has been successful just about everywhere.  But you'll NEVER see him at USC, Texas, Fla St, Ohio St, etc because the boosters and alums just won't let it happen.  They want modern, pro style, 'traditional' (that term is getting more loosely defined these days) offenses.  

At least part of the reason for that is because offenses like those are more injury-proof and more talent resistant, letting the good stay good and the great be great, ensuring wins by preventing losses.  PJ's offense wins games, but never despite itself, if that makes sense.  'Bama's offense wins games because they're better and they don't get in their own way, which is what Saban wants.  Even when they have bad games, they don't have bad enough games to lose.  PJ's offense's bad games are BAD.  This is a big strategic difference between the idea of running a non-traditional offense and running something more vanilla.  If you're better, you want to do the most you can to guarantee a win.  If you're not, you might need to do something to steal a win, although it may be riskier and harder to do right all the time.","1343780154"

Life is tremendously rich and overflowing with amazing shit—not that it discounts our suffering, but certainly our suffering isn't the end all be all measurement of Reality.

So instead I held it in. We started talking and then we started to get worked up on the couch. We then moved over to her bedroom had sex. Like 15 minutes in she starts giving me a blowjob and puts her finger in my ass and starts going to to town. She's done this before and knows that I like it. I was too embarrassed to to tell her not to because I needed to take a shit so I panic and just stayed still. She pulled her finger out and was like, ""Ewwww"" because it was covered in shit.   

She went to the bathroom to clean up and I felt terrible. We never talked about it later and it didn't affect us being FWB for a few years after.

I dont know if non stock weapons works but....

1. Use the tutorial until after the part you copied the proxy materials into the material attribute. (delete all but one)
2. In an attribute called something lime mtiName or something like that, by default it will aim at a scout related texture, delete that scout url, that's it, leave mtiName in blank, or type any key just in case.
3. This is tricky, go to /Steam/SteamApps/Common/sourcefilmmaker/game/tf2/materials/models/weapons/ abd search for the folder of the weapon you want (in my example spy's revolver, w_revolver) go to that folder; w_revolver; and look at the .vmt file name. Copy the url of the file from the models folder part and add the name file (without the .vmt) at the end of the mtiName attribute. In my case something like ""/models/weapons/w_revolver/w_revolver01"" next to the mtiName field
4. Create the preset of the proxy material and in the ANimation Set Editor use the sliders.

If you still have problems tomorrow, in like 8-10h, i will give you images.

"DebateAnAtheist","t5_2ryfy","From a Christian perspective, 

I believe this is a very similar question to ""why does God allow Satan to live?"" (which I happened to listen to today randomly) since Christianity claims it is through Satan by which man is tested. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmOzTY06mBo

Basically, the Bible is silent on the issue, and it asks, via stories like the apple in the garden, that we trust God with the way he has chosen to run the universe and our relationship with him. But John Piper offers a guess (which I feel is very similar to C.S. Lewis's take on why there is evil in the world): it is much more beautiful and glorious for man to have free will and willingly choose God through hardships/tests, than if God were to create us such that we all love and obey him no matter what, in a robot/puppet fashion.

Free will is a serious blessing.

It might have improved again since I moved out. I'll be moving back in this Fall.

It was definitely not MB/s when I tested it, and I know for a fact my FIOS is faster than what I got at the UC and it's Mb/s.

I was also the one who complained like a fucking prick to management, when they said they ""upgraded"" the internet and I was getting slower speeds.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt; Problem is that they often do say that the common definitions don't apply, because ""Christian"" is defined by Google as ""A person who has received Christian baptism or is a believer in Jesus Christ and his teachings,"" and one could reasonably argue that ""Jesus would never agree with the Crusades,"" for example.

One can be of that opinion, yes. But historically, many many Christians disagreed - those that went on the crusades come to mind. And for hundreds and hundreds of years, that wasn't a problem. In that case ""those weren't real Christians"" is just ridiculous beyond belief.

&gt; And individual sects normally have very concrete definitions for their own idea of Christianity, so to that sect it makes perfect sense that others aren't concrete Christians.

Depending on the circumstances, they might not be guilty of the fallacy, actually.

&gt;  And I'm also fairly certain that most Christians, if prompted on this, will point out why the committers in this case don't ""qualify"" beyond ""well, they just aren't!""

They tend to lack comprehensive arguments for why they version of Christianity is objectively better than some other one, though.

"korea","t5_2qiog","Koreans have adapted pizza to fit their palettes and get what they want out of it, just as pretty much every other country has, so let's not talk as though they're inept in the kitchen because something doesn't suit us Westerners. I don't know if it's that they don't understand umami so much as they don't care in regards to pizza. Pizza is considered fast-food by the majority of Koreans so they're not going to be spending a lot of time perfecting the flavors.

Personally, I thought it was really weird to have corn on pizza at first but have since gotten used to it. If I get pizza from Pizza School or the like, I know I'm not getting quality pizza, so I don't worry about the flavor. If you want a more Western style pizza go to Brick Oven Pizza in Gangnam or Crow's Nest in Itaewon.

Escaping slavery is not nearly as unthinkable as *you* claim it to be.

Meanwhile, real people who are attempting their whole lives to escape the demands of the elite who own everything, do not experience those demands as ""voluntary requests.""

You are committing a kind of semantic violence against them, denying the reality of their experience.  You detach yourself from their humanity, and thus you become their enemy, a person who cannot possibly be trusted.

Businesses cannot refuse service to members of a protected class, because the protected class has certain rights that would be curtailed if we allowed businesses to do so. So we've already decided that when it comes to the rights of a business to discriminate, the rights of people, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, trump. 

So now we have a company that isn't even just trying to assert its own right to discriminate against those who would visit their establishment, but is actively trying to legally curtail the rights of a minority. While you may be technically correct that it doesn't currently violate law as written, I think it is pretty obvious that it is violating the spirit.

As for you question about how trying to get the constitution amended and laws changed is violating the civil rights act, well let's just imagine that they were trying to change laws to make interracial marriage illegal.

Top animes, Black Lagoon, Higurashi, Angel Beats, and Durarara!! .
4 pacifists, that are ridiculously powerful when they get serious, a guy who can plan out entire mafia/army conflicts to take down one person, a girl with 100 years of fighting fate and finally beating it, a guy who figures out how to get everyone out of Limbo, and a guy who runs a gang where anyone can join (as in a huge chunk of Tokyo's general population is in it) and actually uses it for good... In all honesty, these characters really wouldn't do much collateral damage themselves, it's their connections that you have to fear. These guys, if they ever found qualms with one another, I fear what chaos they'd leave in their wake.

On pyromania, I really liked it, but the movie, despite being really good and original, I felt cheated out of any actual character to the Pyro. I'm fine that there wasn't a ""big reveal,"" but it really didn't feel like there was any substance added to the character, I mean all you see is that the Pyro is in his ""happy place"" and is seeing things different than reality. Also, I hate how I can't seem to get a Fireproof Diary, people buy 5-6 of them at 20keys, and then sell them at ""1 bud c/o minimum"" right in my face. I know where like 40 out of 500 are, but can't even touch them...

It's getting to the point that either Romeny is the richest and most out of touch person in history who is still making amazing blunders, or the media frenzy over the election is affecting Reddit. Or, quite possibly, political groups are spamming these messages.

Here's another side... You get richer, your expectations of ends meeting gets greater. I complain about how hard it is to make ends meet with salary well below poverty line. But you know what? I still have food, water, shelter, and money to spend on a nice computer. There are plenty people poorer than me who have it harder, but I still find times when it's hard and I might make a comment about it.

That is the most down votes I've gotten on a comment. I guess I'm touched that enough people read opinions voiced on the bottom and decide to vote. 

My point is that I am doing alright, but I would still make a stray comment about how unfortunate my situation is, or how it could be better. So Romney might on occasion as well and might not be considered a complete douche-bag, and it would be easy to portray someone as such. 

I personally believe he is a rich bastard who is looking to benefit other rich bastards, but I like my political debates to be rooted in serious issues. Granted, American elections provide barely any facts or evidence to go on, so it's basically just a bunch of witch hunts. I was mainly just trying to be fair, and say that all these stories portraying him as disconnected are gratuitousness.","1343780185"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","WARNING, THIS IS A BIT GROSS

A faithful day arrived in Kindergarten when my tiny little bladder decided that it was time to release some urine. So, as protocol dictates, I stand in line in the bathroom. There's about four or so people.

The first person goes ahead and proceeds, then leaves. The next person enters the bathroom. Now, allow me to elaborate on this ""next person"". He is a foreign kid who speaks zero of the king's english, and who (not used to the customs of our culture) often exhibits behavior unlike ours. Anywho, this student enters the bathroom, and takes the longest time anyone has ever taken in the history of the planet (at least it felt that way to a five-year-old). Finally, he emerges from his lair, and takes his seat. 

The girl in front of me enters the bathroom. At this point, my bladder is about to burst, and I am focusing all efforts on not pissing myself. Suddenly, the girl, after a mere ten seconds, departs the bathroom, saying,""I don't really have to go anymore.""

I rejoiced! Yes! I may now be permitted by the fates to relieve my bladder!

Trying to contain my excitement (and little kid piss), I rush into the bathroom. Immediately, I found that the foreign kid had left a little gift that took the urge to urinate right out of me.

The young saint had taken it upon himself to re-paint the dull wall color. From much deliberation, I guess he settled on painting from a palate of HIS OWN SHIT. Then, finding the floors rather grimy, he must've gotten down on his hands and knees, and scrubbed the floor clean, with a SPONGE-TURD. Finally, I guess that cold, bland porcelain needed something in the way of insulation and decoration, and what better candidate than NICE, HOT FECES. Ultimately, the entire room had undergone a fecal metamorphosis, except of course the inside of the toilet bowl, that remained clear and clean.

TL, DR: Shitty renovation. ","1343780189"

&gt;       
&gt;To her amazement, the car started straight away. 
&gt;       
&gt;""That's incredible,"" she said. ""You've been here less than a minute and you've managed to fix it. I'm so grateful.""

&gt;""All part of the job, madam. That'll be $250.""

&gt;       
&gt;""I can write you out an itemized bill if you like."" 
&gt;       
&gt;""Yes, please,"" she said firmly. 
&gt;

I suppose I should be more clear. The technical aspects of a computer are divorced from art. The computer itself is not art. The processor frequency, RAM, etc. are quantifiable and measurable; they aren't art. They aren't meant to facilitate any emotional response directly. We don't judge a film as being necessarily better if it is on Blu-ray simply because it has more pixels per frame and more color depth. That is stupid and no serious film critic approaches art that way, while every film critic still accepts Blu-ray as technically superior.

The PS Vita is technically superior to the Gameboy. This does not necessarily make one or the other artistically superior. Yes, they are both computers, but they are specifically designed to facilitate artistic expression unlike most computers, so they can be judged on that level.","1343780202"

It sort of tried to be both and didn't do either particularly well.  Much of the humour was very low brow, like, ""Let's have a racist midget!  That will be funny, right?"" and many of the jokes fell flat.  
  
I kind of feel like a dark comedy needs to either be overtly ridiculous (like Death To Smoochy for example) or subtle and dry.  In Bruges vacillated between the two and came off as inconsistent as a result.    
  
Inconsistent kind of nails the movie for me actually; it's nominally a dark comedy but the tone was really all over the place.  The first time I watched it I liked it well enough but on a second viewing it was tough to get through - it really drags towards the end.

There's a nice little middle ground where people look out for each other without dishonestly representing what they have seen.

Edit: What the OP is ""pretty sure"" about is that the husband is having an affair. She seems to *know* what she saw. She doesn't need to tell her friend things she doesn't know (""Your husband is having an affair.""), but there's nothing wrong with telling her things she does know--""I saw a guy who looked like your husband [or who was your husband, depending on how sure she is] holding hands with another woman.""","1343780214"

Je me suis dit la même chose, mais ça semble être le gouvernement fédéral du Canada qui décide quelles sont les substances illégales!
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Drugs_and_Substances_Act#Schedule_II

Le cannabis est en Schedule II
et selon les quantités définies en Schedule VIII, une possession personelle de plus de 30g de Cannabis ou 1g de hashish peut entraîner un maximum de 5 ans de prison... (wtf)

Je ne sais pas si une province peut quand même écraser cette loi en en créant une nouvelle dictant que le cannabis est complètement légal... à voir! (mais regarde la réponse de ProudCanadiEnt, il semblerait que l'Ontario est en voie de légaliser le cannabis)

_ENGLISH_
Even if provinces have the power to regulate alcohol on their own, cannabis is illegal as defined by the federal CDSA (in Schedule 2) : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Drugs_and_Substances_Act#Schedule_II

I was hurting my team by continuing to play that class because it offered nothing that the other classes were able to do better, so I switched. And before ppl claim I jumped to the FOTM with Assault Vanguard, I didn't even play Assault when I switched. I was a Shield Spec tank.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Hi, and welcome

&gt; I'm not sure that I believe in ""God"".

You *might* be atheist. 

If you do believe in some kind of deity, that's theism. If you don't have theism, that's atheism.

&gt; I believe in balance in the universe. Basically like karma

That's not relevant to atheism, unless you think it involves a god of some kind. You sound like you lack what I'd regard as a suitable amount of skepticism, but that's (at least mostly, see below) a discussion for another time, and has no relation to whether or not you're an atheist.

So just one question for you to ponder (no need to answer it to anyone but yourself, unless you want to):

What's a reliable reason to think such a thing? What principle can you apply by which to arrive at the conclusion 'this supernatural claim is true'?

&gt; Do you think I'm an atheist? 

I can't tell for sure, but you sound like there are no gods you award belief to, which would imply that you are an atheist.

(Though frankly, I don't much care whether strictly speaking you are or not. You're not likely to be doing something stupid or mean because you think some deity said to; that'll do just fine.)

&gt; I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit, sorry if it's not.

Yes, this is *absolutely* the right subreddit for posts like this.

If someone takes a chunk of profit margin, I simply follow him down. This is a problem with Gevlon's logic because he can't know how far someone is willing to follow him, so by his initial action, he sacrifices his own potential profit for zero competitive advantage. It's a game of chicken in a way. The only time this is advantageous for him is if he acquired the goods for a lower price than I did -- which means that in the end, he can still make a profit when I have to break even.","1343780246"

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","&gt;So because other people do bad things that may harm children, we should as well?

Oh, **that's** fair.

No, my point was just that I find the whole ""what about the children"" thing pretty annoying.  If the only reason not to do something is that some random person's kid might then do something else as an indirect result, sorry, you haven't compelled me to change my actions.

By the way, I'm not saying it isn't gross to leave a used tampon hanging out on the beach.  It is.  It is super double gross.  It is gross to adult humans and that's a good enough reason not to do it.  I'm worth just as much as some random kid who isn't even smart enough to know better than to suck on a used tampon.

But this whole ""oh noes, won't someone think about the children, it's not fair to expect parents to always keep their eyes on them"" is a poor argument.  I pay my taxes.  I pay a premium for health insurance to subsidize people who decide to have babies.  What I'm obligated to do for other people's kids?  I'm already doing it.  So please spare me the guilt trip that I'm not moved because people don't watch their kids with perfect vigilance.  Sometimes this means the kid bumps into me, which annoys me, and I do my part for society by being tolerant of the kid instead of snapping at it to watch where it's going.  Seriously, I don't ""owe"" parents just because they have kids.","1343780252"

If you hit them to make them do what you want, you can expect them to hit other people to make them do what they want.

Of course, if you want your children to hit people to make them do what they want, then that's fine, go ahead and teach them to hit.

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","A little while ago, bush decided that the people werent learning well enough. Now thats a hard problem to fix, and no real simple obvious answer. He though that teachers werent trying hard enough and were all getting payed weather the students learned or not. his solution to the problem was the NCIB. basically, they give a test to all the students and see which ones actually learned from their teachers, and the kids who did poorly got less money for the teachers, and the ones who did well got more. But now we have a bit of a problem, because even if the students can all get 100% on that test, the teachers can, and its not hard to find the questions, or at least the type of questions they ask. the end up basically only teaching what that test will cover and spoon feed those answers to the kids. Now the teachers are set, but the kids dont really learn anything. they only know the answers to THOSE specific questions. also if your subject/area/topic isnt on the test, good luck trying to convince your principal to let to spend any time on it because they are all worried thats not time making the students memorize the stuff that will make them money

sorry a bit long, but the best i could do

TL;DR
Teachers only teach things on the test that determines funding and not teach other stuff, or teaching at all.

The Universe was some lawful place. Today we see science as producing predictive explanatory models. We call those models theories. The term law survives as a vestige of the old views. In general a scientific law is a short pithy saying or concise formula that captures some ""core"" notion in a model. But laws are subservient (so to speak) to the models, they exist only as they are embedded in the model. The best example is f=ma, one of Newton's Laws.

Then if THAT happened, researchers would be forced to publish in lower journals with lower publication costs, and the overall Canadian impact on science would go down.

To answer the original question, he's clearly not worth the salary he is being paid at City. If he was as good as Aguero, say, then he'd be playing for City and be worth that money. He's not, so he's not. 

Adebayor needs to recognise this and he needs to recognise that City have done him several favours in trying to help him move- which most people seem to overlook- through loan deals with both Real Madrid and Spurs. At some point he has to repay this good faith or he has to earn his money collecting the cones and the nets at Carrington. It's his decision.

"doctorwho","t5_2qhek","You raise a lot of the same points I have about *Doctor Who* currently and Moffat.

Both RTD and Moffat could write some wonderful individual episodes but they both have a problem with the overarching plots. They always end up falling short. It's no surprise to me that Moffat has seemed to recognize this and is focusing on more individual stories next series.

I have to also agree with you on River Song. Alex Kingston is a wonderful actress, but the character of River Song has fallen far short of expectations. Maybe it's suppose to be a tragic love tale between her and the Doctor but I've yet to see any evidence that suggests the two really love one another. River certainly likes the Doctor and flirts with him quite a bit. The Doctor certainly likes River but I think it's more like he likes all of his companions.

Her being [spoiler](#s ""Rory and Amy's kid"") came off to me as very fan fiction. That's the thing I've come to understand however. Steven Moffat is living the dream we all have. He's a giant fan who not only gets to write for the show he grew up but also run it.

Overall, I think Steven Moffat has been good for Doctor Who. However, there have been some flaws in his run. I probably wouldn't mind them as much if there wasn't such a rabid fanbase that says everything he does or 11 does is the greatest thing ever.

That's my two cents.","1343780284"

Rather than bitch about inequalities or injustice, and spread hate toward the group that does it (many of which may not even partake in it), raise awareness, educate people to the particular sect (i.e. Westboro Baptist Church) that is acting as a perpetrator, and ACT to dismantle it via an integrity-savvy movement.

"worldnews","t5_2qh13","agree with that. My dad was once working night shifts (also in IT) for a few months and that was disastrous for the entire family. Our day/night clocks are very significant esp to keep in sync with world around us.

I think your argument lost steam there once you mentioned 3-day/wk thing bc at first it sounded like u were treated like slaves. WHICH is actually a real concern for workers all across the US these days (afaik). But the problem is not ""Indians taking off at whim"" ...problem is in choosing to outsource and not being able to execute it well -- you must choose which company can handle your work up to par with your standard. Not every little ""IT Support"" company that's cropped up in India or any other country delivers the same quality as other IT support companies (which might be more expensive to contract). 

I'm saying this bc I've noticed this communication/efficiency/quality gap in a lot of outsourced work (the big gun IT support companies not excluding) -- even though the talent might be there, sometimes it's just difficult to get it done perfectly bc of the distance. Which, again, is a structural change companies need to learn to tackle.

Edit: The reason workers in the US are having to take up a huge chunk of the workload is bc companies are not willing to hire expensive workers in the US -- that is the whole problem. Even though you NEED more manpower here, you're not getting that support.","1343780297"
"DeadBedrooms","t5_2t25p","Yeah...I want a lot of things too. I want my wife to be what I'm getting from multiple other women right now. I want to have sex with her everyday. I wish that she would initiate more. I wish she were into things like threesomes and group play and we could do all of that together.

But that's not happening.

At some point you have to step back, take a cold, hard look at reality, and make the best of what you've got. In regards to your wife, you said ""fixable"" which kind of assumes that she's broken. You have to realize that she isn't. Not everyone is interested in sex. Some people are just low libido. And that's no more right or wrong than you being average/high libido. But you two are married, and not being on the same page here causes problems. So what do you do about it?

You also said ""maintain a happy facade"" if you just accept your sexless lifestyle. Let me tell you now, that's going to be impossible. The frustration doesn't just magically disappear. You wouldn't have cheated if you were okay with the situation. And if you wife truly loves you, she'll be able to see through the facade anyway.

So you do whatever you need to do to make yourself happy. To take away that frustration and resentment, so you can be the husband and father your family needs. Sometimes, that solution isn't pretty. It doesn't always jive with what we consider to be ""right."" But you do it because you have to.","1343780297"

"Fitness","t5_2qhx4","I might suggest rather than using a scale to use a mirror. 

Cut down to a weight you're happy with- some random aesthetic goal is common like someone wants to see their abs. So pick yours and go to that. 

When you get there, you've got a blank canvas for adding weight. Start at +250/500/1000 and keep a visual record record as well as a strength record. 

So in a month's time if you can't see your abs, are you growing in the places you want to grow? Chest, shoulders, legs, back, arms? Are you stronger than a month ago? If yes, you're doing it right, if no you're doing it wrong. 

Lots of trial and error, these things take time. I don't try to make dramatic changes in my calorie intake and I sure as heck don't use the scale. If I'm dieting down I might progressively eat less and less over the course of a few weeks, same thing for trying to grow in the other direction. ","1343780298"

Thornmail does 30% of the damage you deal.

Now Thornmail does 20% of the damage you deal from autoattacks.

So, assuming you have 200 AD and 50 magic resist, and they have just thornmail, so around 150 armor, you're dealing 80 damage a hit, with the thornmail dealing a whopping 16 damage a strike. Lifesteal items can easily counteract it / make it obselete, and thornmail also wouldn't deal real damage. Two bloodthirsters, or a bloodthirster + lifesteal item would completely counteract thornmail, which completely defeats its purpose of being an item that counteracts glass cannon AD builds.

As it stands now, any AD which buys any defensive items is not noticing the damage. That nerf to Thornmail's damage is going to make it useless: why get Thornmail when you would be able to get Frozen Heart with one less armor.","1343780308"

Veganism goes usually a lot deeper (although there are vegans who do it just for dietary reasons). Ethical veganism opposes the idea of using animals for anything, no matter how practical it might be, because morals are superior to unnecessary suffering. And even seemingly harmless quick and painless death is immoral when there's an option to avoid it. Giving somebody option to run away when you very well can leave the being be is also not in harmony with ethical veganism.
So that's no from me, but you might want to ask r/vegetarian, they have quite warped reasoning for my taste :)","1343780313"

As for cap hill specific tips...I don't have much. I have been looking for a good ""restaurant"" to buy take-out food from, so I can take it home and throw veggies and meat in there to make it a bigger dish that last for days. So far, no luck :C

But yeah, if you are strap for cash, try to cook at home more often. Do not drink out. 

Find one or two hobbies that you ABSOLUTELY enjoy, and only spend money on those. Cut down the rest of the luxuries that you don't really care about. 

Consider free entertainment, such as hitting the library and read books for a day. 

Eat well, so you don't get sick often. Go exercise (not necessarily hitting the gym. Running around the block works too). Healthy food doesn't have to be expensive. Learn how to tell whether meat/veggie/fruits are in fresh/good condition. Eat whatever meat, fruits, and veggies are on sale in your local grocery store, given conditions are good (don't buy bad ingredients just so you can save a dollar or so). If you are willing to travel a bit, the viet grocery stores in Intl District tend to have cheap and fresh produce, albeit a little ghetto.

Also, think of the flip side of the coin: What can you DO to INCREASE your income? Being frugal is good and all, but you will always stay at that level if you don't spend time increasing your spending power. Discover yourself. Find things that you enjoy. Out of those, find the ones that you are good at. Now, think about how to use these handful of skills to make more moolahs.","1343780319"

"TrueChristian","t5_2u489","This is quite correct. I'll add my own comments:

The most commonly used translation of the Bible in English in the United States is the New American Bible Revised Edition. Other common editions are the Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition and the Jerusalem Bible.

Actually, the Church does ""endorse"" certain translations, insofar as their use in public worship. The translations allowed for use at Mass in the USA are the NABRE and the RSVCE. In England, they use the Jerusalem Bible.

Beyond that, the Church doesn't typically ""endorse"" translations for personal use, although there have been cases where particular translations were officially condemned as inaccurate. (Example: New World Bible, used by  Jehovah's Witness.)

The Ten Commandments are not numbered 1 through 10 in the Bible. In fact, the passages of scripture we get them from contain fourteen imperative statements. To group them into Ten ""Commandments,"" we have to group some of the statements together. Catholics, Protestants, and Jews have different ways of doing this. It is important to note that the choice of numbering is NOT a matter of divine revelation, but is simply a human tradition. (Doesn't make it wrong to number them, it just means we can't thump a Bible at each other over the issue.)

As far as the second commandment: Protestants have the 2nd Commandment as the prohibition against graven images. Catholics include that as part of the 1st Commandment. (Again, just numbered differently.)

As to the issue of statues, I'm going to paste below an article I wrote on the topic a while back.


""Do Catholics Worship Statues""?
     It’s true that the Catholic Church uses many images, such as the crucifix, stained glass windows, statues of Mary, Angels, and the Saints, not to mention many other physical signs such as incense, holy water, and the sign of the cross. But are they graven images?

Let’s look at what the Bible says. In Exodus 20: 4-5 (where we find the Ten Commandments), it says, “You shall not make for yourself a graven image or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: you shall not bow down to them or serve them.” It may be easy to misinterpret this as a blanket commandment against the use of any kind of image.

Yet, if we turn just a few pages to Exodus 25, we find that God commands the making of certain images. In Exodus 25, it says, “And you shall make to cherubim of gold; of hammered work shall you make them, on the two ends of the mercy seat. Make one cherub on the one end, and one cherub on the other end; of one piece of the mercy seat shall you make the cherubim on its two ends. The cherubim shall spread out their wings above, overshadowing the mercy seat with their wings, their faces one to another; toward the mercy seat shall the faces of the cherubim be.” Similar instructions for the making of images for religious use are found in 1 Chronicles 28 and Ezekiel 41.

Clearly, unless God is contradicting Himself, we must take some other meaning out of Exodus 20. The Church has always interpreted this Commandment as a prohibition of the worshipping of images. In the Baltimore Catechism, Paragraphs 340 and 343, it says: “Q: Does the first Commandment forbid the making of images? A. The first Commandment does forbid the making of images if they are made to be adored as gods, but it does not forbid the making of them to put us in the mind of Jesus Christ, His Blessed Mother, and the saints.” 343: “It is not allowed to pray to the crucifix or images and relics of the saints, for they have no life, nor power to help us, nor sense to hear us.” In 787 A.D., the Church condemned the worship of images at the Second Council of Nicaea. And again at the Council of Trent in 1566 (Catechism of Trent, Paragraph 374). The Catechism of the Catholic Church reaffirms this teaching in paragraphs 2129-2132: ""Already in the Old Testament, God ordained or permitted the making of of images that pointed symbolically toward salvation by the incarnate Word.” (CCC 2130)

Therefore, the images we use in worship are not a violation of the Commandment against graven images, so long as we do not “transfer our notion of God to anything other than God.” (Origen, Contra Celsum 2, 40: 11, 861) We are free to to use images to direct our hearts and minds to God, but it is prudent to be cautious against mistaking the image for the thing itself.","1343780321"

Then I slid up his body and facing away from him, proceeded to give him a bj while letting him watch as prepared myself with my own fingers.

"Games","t5_2qhwp","My guess is that New Vegas was too soon after Fallout 3. It was an improvement by far, but it felt a lot like more of the same and it lacked the quality gap that you see between Fallout 3 and Fallout 2.

Skyrim came out 6 years after Oblivion, longer than some console generations, and I'd say it was a better experience than New Vegas simply because of the technology that powered it. The two also have similar yet different gameplay that appeals to two different audiences. Skyrim's audience is much larger and appeals to both hardcore and casual gamers without ruining the experience for either.

I'd say the problem is not that New Vegas received a low score. In fact, an 84% is fucking fantastic. The problem is with the grading itself. No games ever get below a 50, and so unless the game scores perfectly it's immediately devalued. Everything gets clustered to the top of the scale and it's nearly impossible to say for sure what a game will score, because reviewers are fickle bitches.","1343780327"

There are several reasons for corn-subsidies - [I straight out cite Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_States):

&gt;Established in 1996, direct payments were originally meant to wean farmers off traditional subsidies that are triggered during periods of low prices for corn, wheat, soybeans, cotton, rice, and other crops.

and

&gt;Corn is the top crop for subsidy payments. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 mandates that billions of gallons of ethanol be blended into vehicle fuel each year, guaranteeing demand, but US corn ethanol subsidies are between $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion per year. Producers also benefitted from a federal subsidy of 51 cents per gallon, additional state subsidies, and federal crop subsidies that can bring the total to 85 cents per gallon or more. However, the federal ethanol subsidy expired December 31, 2011.[16] (US corn-ethanol producers were shielded from competition from cheaper Brazilian sugarcane-ethanol by a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff, however that tariff also expired December 31, 2011.[17][18])

Subsidies for farmers in the US has a long history, at least dating back to the 1920s, before the rise of ""big ag"": Check out the [Agriculture Marketing Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_Marketing_Act) from 29

**tl;dr: Corn is subsidised to keep production-levels stable in times when it's too cheap to produce, and to ensure that there's always enough ethanol in gasoline  (which keeps your gas-prices lower)**","1343780332"

i've had my 910xt for a bit over 2 months and use it for riding and running so far. it rocks. you go out, do a bunch of activities, come home, bring it near your computer and it will automatically upload them all to garmin connect. 

garmin connect gives you maps, as well as all tables summarising the activity. it is OK, but not great. i also upload everything to strava, as i use that to track my progress for both running and cycling, uploads are VERY easy, and fast. 

it is dead easy to use, generally accurate (although the elevation data does drift a little, but is still much better than gps). it provides more data than you will ever need and connects via ant+ allowing you to use speed/cadence sensors, hr monitors and footpods.

So now we have a bunch of buyers being punished for giving their opinion (and true, some who may deserve it). This perpetuates a culture of fear and retaliation and to be frank, it drives away business. I can tell you with certainty negative feedback will never come back. 

We are expanding the buyer abuse and report a buyer programs to make them better in our next seller release however to make this process more effective. 


As to returns... buyer protection must be there. Without it, the confident level of eBay buyers tanks, and so does the price of your goods. While I cannot back this with facts, I would be willing to venture that any cost you maintain from the current 1.9% return rate that is on eBay, you would lose much more than that in lost sales and lowballed auctions from fearful buyers. Just my two cents on that, and food for thought on those who only see one side of the equation.","1343780335"

"australia","t5_2qh8e","The trend of a declining suicide rate was already established, however it is undeniable that suicide by firearms did decrease by a statistically significant amount post buy back (with 5% level of significance).  

There is a well put together study analysing the data from the buy back by Andrew Leigh (ANU) and Christine Neill that was published in 2010 (I have a copy saved but don't know how to upload so maybe google it?) it's worth reading.  Basically the 1996 laws have not had any significant statistical impact on firearm homicide rate or total suicide rate.

Gun laws are always an emotive topic and it's hard to see through the trumped up ""data"" from both sides however there has been no independent studies showing any conclusive evidence that 1996 changed anything.  

Interestingly (food for thought) Mexico has some of the toughest gun laws in the world and also one of the highest rates of intentional homicide.  Conversely the Czech Republic has very lax laws and sits squarely between Canada and New Zealand in homicide rates.

Please note that I am not advocating that Australia get rid of gun control!  I am just trying to put some perspective on this shit fight.

And the arbitrary rules don't mesh well with my perception of how dreams occur or play out... Though, I'll admit some of the ideas (namely the multi-layer time dilation) were okay.

"offbeat","t5_2qh11","You are making a fair point, but I don't think you've considered all the angles.  

First- you must understand this is not just a 'no-shirt-no-shoes-no-service' type situation.  You must keep in mind that denying licensed CCWs their sidearms is also denying their means of self-defense.  The theater in Aurora, CO was a posted 'gun free zone'.  Nobody in that theater was armed- except the psycho shooter.  That's the problem with gun free zones- only the law-abiding citizens respect them.  Criminals don't see a gun-free zone, they see a disarmed-victim zone.  So in creating a gun-free zone, you are in fact putting every customer at somewhat greater risk.

Second- accidental and negligent discharges in public places by CCWs is absurdly rare.  There are (IMHO) maybe a hundred per year in the whole country, if that.  (I have no stats on this, I'd welcome any you have to present).  On the flip side there are hundreds or thousands of armed robberies every day.  To me that seems like a much greater threat.  So I reject the notion that benign CCWs will create any measurable risk to a business owner, certainly not more than the risk of armed robbery.

Third- if you are presuming that people are thinking rationally about gun control, I have a bridge I'd like to sell you.  They aren't.  It's called hoplophobia- fear of weapons, or just as commonly people just not thinking a situation through.

Let's say you have a public place.  You want people to be safe in your public place.  So you want to keep bad things out of your public place.  You want to stop gangs, drugs, etc.  And you also want to stop guns.  Because you definitely don't want anybody to get shot in your public place, you want it to be viewed as a safe place to take your family.  So you put up a gun free zone sign, problem solved.

Except problem not solved.  The people who are going to shoot up the place don't follow the gun free zone sign, they bring a gun anyway.  But you aren't thinking about this when you put up the gun free zone sign, you just want to keep armed gang bangers and drug dealers out of your public place.  If you'd thought it through, you'd realize your gun free zone stickers don't apply to them.

If you are a problem drinker, and if you're visiting this sub I'm guessing you have your suspicions you might be, you can't start and stop. ","1343780376"

Have you ever seen sugar or salt crystals under your microscope? If your mum and dad buy granulated sugar, or if you eat sea salt (if you don't you can also grow your own crystals), you can see how pointy they are, even though they grow without a template or anything, that's caused by the way the molecules fit together. [Look how square this one is!](http://chemistry.about.com/od/growingcrystals/ig/Crystal-Projects-Photo-Gallery/Potash-Alum-Crystal.htm)

[Here are some crystals I've grown](http://i.imgur.com/UUVLd.jpg). If you look carefully on the edges they're perfect hexagons. That's because the molecules in the crystal have three lines of reflection (or mirror lines) in them, like a triangle, and the molecules tessellate into hexagons. It's amazing that the maths and geometry you have already learnt are what govern tiny molecules like this!","1343780380"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I always thought I would wait a really long time to get married, and I had a couple 3+ year relationships, but my husband moved in after 3 months and we were married after 3 more.  It actually wasn't impulsive like I'm sure it sounds...immigration was a factor, and after a lot of research and thought, we felt like it was the best decision for us to get married when we did.  In retrospect, I'm very glad we did.

If our hand wasn't a little forced, I never would have married so early into a relationship, but I'm actually pretty grateful that we had a reason to take the plunge.  

Sometimes I feel a little silly admitting how quickly we got married, but every time it comes up, everyone in the conversation knows some couple that got married in even less time and has been happily married even longer.  So in that sense, I guess we're pretty unremarkable :)

Since she's basically terrified of him now, yet he moves back in even though he's not selling the condo and tells Marie about Ted.

It doesn't seem like she would ever go to the cops or anything, but just straight up driving her crazy seems like it will attract unwanted attention. 
He seems to just be more crazy altogether, like hinting to Jesse he should break up with his gf.  He has already done so much shit to Jesse, he can't let him be happy?  I mean that gf chick seems like she has a bit of a ghetto upbringing and wouldn't be ratting Jesse out.
To me this season he is causing more trouble for himself than he ever did previously.  Before, even though he made some bad decisions he was more put into a corner, now it's almost like he's just a crazy person batting at the bee hive of his life.

"ainbow","t5_2tcpq","&gt;of those who did identify as trans*, the majority — 58% — are trans women

&gt;Trans women feel more comfortable than trans men, on average.

I am somewhat troubled by this statistical trend. I understand that our community inherits certain popular sentiments from the larger reddit community, but as socially-aware GSRM folks we largely make the neccessarry adjustments to combat those sentiments that are negative, and so the presence of such a large disparity as this one indicates to me that certain discriminationary attitudes have not been adequately accounted for here in r/ainbow.

To speculate as to why, I will say that I think r/ainbow, and the internet GSRM community as a whole for that matter, has not sufficiently analyzed how male-assignment connects to the dynamics of patriarchy and male privilege. Trans* folks who grew up under male-assignment don't experience it the same way as cis folks do, surely, but a legacy of such privilege *does* exist, one that has significant and continuing effects on our perceptions and dispositions.  

If feel that r/ainbow's understanding of trans* identity has become hegemonic/preclusive to certain aspects of trans* experience as a result of this unchecked dynamic. This means that we are marginalizing trans* men and other trans* people who have been made targets of patriarchy as a result of past female-assignment.

___________


After looking back and seeing [this](http://i.imgur.com/tK1P2.png), I will say that I think the statements I have asserted here could be expanded to include a lack of accountability for the broader dynamic of male privilege and the marginalization of GSRM women in general.

Seeing as he was apparently capable of tapping the Heart's power without the tools (he SOMEHOW became strong enough to fight off the Tribunal, thousands of years after he last possessed the tools), it was probably more for symbolic purposes.

"MensRights","t5_2qhk3","I've said the above things before and for the most part it's been well received.  Most MRAs don't pretend that women don't face *some* gender-specific issues (like snide sexist remarks in a male-dominant industry, the horror), but they are considered rare and/or irrelevant.  Violence and sexual assault are not even remotely gender-specific.  Nearly *all* MRAs acknowledge that women get the shit-end of the stick in third world and developing nations.  It's still irrelevant because men's rights have nothing to do with those nations.  

&gt;I've been the victim of rape, and domestic violence.

You have my deepest condolences.  However, that isn't a women's rights issue, because men are frequently victims of rape and domestic violence themselves.  It's a human rights issue.  Note that this position **does not** diminish the severity of what happened to you nor does it make it less important.  The reason why there is so much focus on male abuse in /r/MensRights is because there isn't much focus on it anywhere else.  Abused women have shelters, nonprofit organizations for support, emergency hotlines, and charities.  It's *wonderful* that women have those resources, I wouldn't take a single one away.  Where the problem lies is that there are no such resources for men.  The injustice lies in the one-sided support.  

Focusing on the legitimate problems of one group does not diminish the problems of the other (something the feminists desperately need to get through their skulls).  But it's important to draw the distinctions between legitimacy and being petty/making shit up.  Feminists claim that mothers rights are infringed upon when it comes to their children, or they are at a disadvantage when compared to the rights of fathers.  What a bold faced lie.  They say that the evil patriarchy demands women shave their legs/stay in shape/wear deodorant!  How petty.  They liken a few women who drunkenly consent to sex then feel bad about it the next day to the plight of women in Afghanistan.  What an offensive and outrageous statement.  

&gt;Inserting a divide and trying to tear down the ""other side"" is a waste of everyones' time.

I wholeheartedly agree!  Trying to discredit feminism is like trying to fill a lake with a teaspoon.  Ignore them, focus on the real issues and let feminists discredit themselves.  Let them waste their time trying to stop MRA while we actually *do something* for society.  ","1343780394"

The possibility of sexual orientation change is completely independent of whether or not I think gay sex is sinful.

"cripplingalcoholism","t5_2s68b","The community seems to be pretty divided on this topic. I've been on both sides of this actually. I'll share my experiences for what it's worth.

I was with a girl (lived together for most of this time) for 2 years who did not drink. Every once in a while she would drink at a party, but never more than one or two. My drinking was a major source of tension is our relationship, and was a major component in our separation. I think this is because we met while I was sober, during my longest stretch of sobriety (about 6 months). If you someone falls in love with you while you are drinking, they probably won't care that you are a drunk, even if they don't drink.

I was with another girl for 4 years (high school sweethearts, moved in together after high school for about 2 years). We discovered alcohol together, and both drank heavily throughout our relationship. The only time we ever had arguments (up until the very end) was when we were both belligerently drunk. We would fight about the most trivial shit, and say incredibly hurtful things to one another that we would come to regret in the morning. I would not say that alcohol was a factor in our breakup, rather the demons we both harbored (and were brought out by alcohol) caused the breakup. 

Sometimes with relationships, it's not what you have in common that keeps you together, but the ways that you are different. Think ""complimentary"" and not ""identical"". My sober gf saved my ass many times while I was shitty drunk and about to throw a brick at a cop car or pass out in a gutter, general debauchery etc. The drunk gf was no help at all when I passed out on the el train. She was drunk too and just wandered off. 

But it's hard to make these sort of generalizations from anecdotal evidence.","1343780401"

"IAmA","t5_2qzb6"," Mr. Laporte, Thank You for your time.
 The other day you made a rather blunt statement in the TechGuy Show, that there is no way ARM processors
 would ever make it to the desktop.  Is it assumed, that it is because of the large amount of code that x86 
presents for itself for ARM, along with the battery and heat issues to be dealt with? Is the real determining 
factor, that is that a mobile device is ""acceptable"" or not, (outside aesthetics and icon bending) is it's innate 
ability to pull in fast, clean, and unbroken internet code from all the major sites. I realize that trying to get ARM 
to running regular X86 code would be like a lawn mower engine trying to power a cadillac. But if the big boys 
(intel,amd) can't come down to fit the bill on their side. And ARM can't scale up to do it on their side. Who do we
 send in (or invent) to pop the cherry in the middle. As some of your tech people have said. ""What wouldn't they
 pay to have their desktop experience riding on the back of their hand"". I wonder with your vast knowledge, if 
you couldn't come up with a suitable action on your part to help this little problem on it's way.  Thanks for your 
time. Hope I'm not wasting it, with such a monster question.","1343780407"

And if the world did indeed bend to our illusions every time, then the illusions would be real enough. Our mind would have power over the matter and reality, like in dreams.

Logic is valuable because it matches with the reality. It is not valuable by definition. And you can, and do verify it with reality all the time.

We will notice immediately if logic stops matching with reality, everything stops making sense. Our thinking falls apart, computers cannot perform useful operations, your predictions start failing, wall is not wall, floor is not floor, hurting yourself does not hurt, history and future do not match, directions stop making sense, objects stop being objects.

You can occasionally notice in your dreams how these things happen, since your brain fails to simulate logic accurately, and fails to bend the simulated reality to match your thinking.

And if logic falls apart, all arguments fail. But religious arguments fail even more, because they have much longer chains of logic on top of the basic logic.

&gt;Calling yourself a libertarian today is a lot like wearing a mullet back in the nineteen eighties. It sends a clear signal: business up front, party in the back.

&gt;Their whole ideology is like a big game of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It’s all make-believe, except for the chain-mail–they brought that from home.

The entire article just keeps attacking people who support libertarianism labeling them as drug addled, sex crazed idiots who wish to be cool and in actual fact don't understand what they are supporting. Not once does the writer attempt to coherently explain what's wrong with the actual political philosophy.

Personally, I am neither for or against libertarianism as I don't completely understand the philosophy. 
After reading this article the only thing I learned about libertarianism is that the OP is very strongly against it. I wish he'd clearly and objectively told me why, so you know... I could make my own informed and unbiased desicion.","1343780415"

also, PRO-TIP: if you have an ant problem you're sure is coming from outside, call a pest controller and tell them to bring [Termidor](http://www.pestcontrolamerica.com/product_images/u/427/Termidor-SC__97453_zoom.jpg). best ant treatment ever.","1343780425"

Yes, the SI unit of time is the second. But in real life, we use minutes and hours and days and weeks and years. We use them because they are convenient correspondences to real life.

Understand, my beef is not with metric units per se. There is nothing more or less useful about a gallon than a liter. What bugs me about the metric system is that it was designed to make MATH easy, not human interaction with the world.

I totally support the use of the metric system in science. It is of immense usefulness there. But imagine how fucked up it would be to use 2.6 x 10^6 seconds when you mean a month?

"keto","t5_2rske","If you eat enough carbohydrates to kick yourself out of ketosis, then you will have to go through adaptation again. At the same time, ""keto flu"" is actually a symptom of an electrolyte imbalance and should be most easily avoided by having a 1-2 grams of sodium (or 1-2 cups of broth), which I normally still supplement even though I haven't been out of ketosis since I started almost six months ago.

I'm out in the sun &amp; am on my feet a lot, so I start suffering those same keto flu symptoms (headache, light headedness, abnormally exhausted, cramps) if I don't have that broth before I go to work. And I usually drink a Powerade Zero as well to be on the safe side in this hot weather.

Back to keto flu, this is why people frown upon cheating in this subreddit. I'm pretty sure there was a note somewhere to not make posts endorsing cheating too for that very reason, but maybe I'm imagining things.

For example, right now there is some back to school thing where if you shop at certain stores online you get double points. 

I can log into a website where I can exchange my points for other things too, like hotels or cruises, but I can only use Southwest or Jet Blue for air miles. The amount of points for a flight is proportional to the cost of that flight, if you get on their website you have an option to see the cost in ""points"". 

The card itself has a yearly cost, so you have to really be using it enough for it to be worth more than the $100 or so you have to spend. You also have to be careful not to go crazy with it, like any credit card, because obviously they are betting on making money off impulsive spenders.

"CampingandHiking","t5_2qqom","If all you're doing is boiling water, then get the Jetboil. It boils water extremely fast and very efficiently. If you ever want to do much more than that though, I strongly suggest looking to something else.

I use a [caldera cone](traildesigns.com) and it is really one of the better alcohol stoves out there. May not look like much, but the windscreen and can stove that it comes with make for a very efficient little set. My friend used his jetboil and I used my caldera on our JMT hike we just finished and I think neither of us have any complaints. In case you want some real world numbers, I most likely used about 10oz or so of alcohol for the entire 17 days and he used about 1/2 to 3/4 of a small butane canister in about 9 days. He bought a brand new one halfway through the trip at our resupply, but was pretty sure he could have made it the entire 17 days on a single small canister. I would say that's pretty dang efficient!!","1343780436"

In every situation, at least one of two things is true:

1. My nonviolence will defuse a violent situation because love is the only thing that can win against hate.
2. God is just, and will either protect me against unjust violence or give the violent actor their due, whether in this world or the next.

I don't think it's my responsibility to take down oppressors.  I work through acts of love to subvert systems of oppression (this persistence *is* my responsibility), but at the end of the day, I haven't personally failed or succeeded based on whether the oppressive system still stands.

"TrollXChromosomes","t5_2sekm","Im seconding gearsntears, you are not supposed to wear any underwear with bike shorts. If you do a bike ride, then get home and shower the time in the shorts is minimal, and there are certain synthetics that are better for moisture transmission than cotton. In my case I was in Afghanistan for 6 mos, and the only days I was comfortable and didn't have swamp crotch all day (and the recurrent excessive smell) was when wearing wick-away underwear. Thick fatigue pants didn't help either :/. 

BUT in any other situation, I agree that cotton underwear washed in dye- and perfume- free detergent is probably the best bet. 

They make special compounds that also help with friction in bicycle shorts, but for the love of your labia DO NOT use the cooling or mentholated type! If you are on your period then its probably better to use a tampon w/o a string or tuck it or a menstrual cup. Really though I switched to re-usable cotton pantyliners or use no-chemical disposables when I don't use my cup because I found that the conventional pantyliners make me feel itcy and sore for a couple days after.

We cannot observe a counterfactual of shock / no-shock, except maybe in experimental economics.

However, you've often seen campaigns on the internet to say ""No one buy gas to protest X"".  In this instance, the shock isn't even permanent, as behavior only changes at a very micro level (a day), whereas overall consumption for the week remains (likely) the same.

Looking at this scenario is a practical sense, I doubt the blip would last long enough to have much of an effect.  People have to drink and eat.

"DebateAChristian","t5_2ryd5","I see your point. like I said though,I don't know the struggles of homosexuality and couldn't give you an honest opinion on it. If you want a better understanding it would be best to ask a homosexual Christian. 
I could give you another example that may better explain, but still wouldn't truly compare to the homosexual style for a variety of reasons. 

When I was younger I thought smoking weed on a regular basis wouldn't be a problem either. I mean it doesn't show long term effects, peoples parents are pot heads, successful people smoke weed, and the list goes on for the ""positives of marijuana."" I smoked pretty much every evening. 
I don't want to go into a long drawn out story so heres what I found. It  destroyed my relationship with my family, made me slow witted, drained my wallet, destroyed a couple friendships, and created new ones that ended up getting me robbed. I found it kinda changed my personality as well, and became something I turned to for comfort in place of God. I was someone that was totally convinced that smoking weed wasn't that bad and something I could be able to spend my life doing as long as I used moderation. What I have found is that it is nothing anyone should invest themselves into, it became a destructive behavior and difficult to quit when it came time to move on in my life. It almost took away college from me, and then almost got me kicked out of my program I had worked in for for years.(almost completely ruined a career, because I smoked on the wrong day after a long time of not smoking) 

I hope that helps a little once again. This is no doubt a terrible comparison. My point is not that homosexual individuals should give that up, If their not a Christian we at no way have a right to impose our life styles upon them. ""Free will"" is literally that, we may live this life anyway we choose. Christians are not trying to force our morals on homosexuals (if you gay and have no faith in God, by all means live as you please ""free will"") What is happening with the whole gay marriage thing is that Christians feel that homosexuality is pushing its morality upon us and our institutions (marriage). Here's the thing though, marriage for us is something conducted before God not before Government. We see the final authority as God and no marriage is real for us unless its before God, which is why we do these usually with a priest in a church. Now I'm pretty sure no one in the LGBT community wants a marriage before the Christian God. There asking for marriage in the most legal sense just before the Government so they can enjoy similar rights with their partners. This is what a lot of Christians can't understand, they are not asking for our definition of marriage, but an earthly one. I think eventually the LGBT community will achieve that. So in short the arguments between communities is not about bigotry, but just trying to protect whats sacred to us, and a misunderstanding of what that is.(on our part). Now this brings up another issue though, (adoption) See now this is where your gonna run into problems with me I'm sure. I am extremely wary of adoption of children to gay couples, I think their is something to be said about having a mother and father. I believe if a child is going to be adopted out it needs to be to the most capable and complete idea of a family unit as possible.

(To be eligible the gymnastic athletes must turn 16 during the Olympic year). Dong also lost a sixth-place result in the individual floor exercises and seventh in the vault. FIG recommended the IOC take the medal back as her scores aided China in winning the team bronze. The US women's team, who had come fourth in the event, then moved up to third (bronze medal).[28]""

Brides are beautiful, regardless of their size. I'm not really into weddings or dresses, but I've seen shows about brides who try on dresses. Some of those brides are overweight, and they still look great in their wedding gowns! Just try to focus on finding one that's flattering to your body type.

As for taking photos, I think you should at least allow the guests to take photos with their own digital cameras. You won't want to regret not having any photographs to remember the special occasion. There are photos I look awful in, but having photos as reminders of special things I've done is more important than looking good in a photo.

We're all our own biggest critics. I still sometimes ask my boyfriend if I'm ""conventionally attractive,"" even though I get compliments from others.

"cad","t5_2qwha","20% is a 5:1 slope. (100/20=5) Draw a line at an angle across the contours where the distance along your line from one contour to the next (say the 4950 contour to the 4951 contour) is at least 5' long. the easiest way to do this is to draw a 5' radius circle at any point on your tightest (steepest) contours. If your contours are 2 foot contours meaning you the go from say 4950 to 4952 then draw a 10' radius.  

Use the first line that you draw as your centerline, then offset the centerline to each side half of your road width.

Then to do x-sections say every 20' draw a circle with a 20' radius at the beginning of your road centerline and then draw a line from the intersection of the circle and the centerline perpendicular to the edge of your road. Copy this circle by the center point of the circle to the intersection of the circle and the centerline. Over and over along you road centerline. (Circles are the same distance in all directions and therefor are very helpful to draw with.) 

To figure out the elevations at the edges of your road draw a line from each point where the circles intersect your centerline perpendicular to each side of your road. Look at the contours and guess what the elevations are by looking at the closest contours. If you need to be more precise you can figure it out using rise over run.  

To do that you just need to extend your line from the edge of the road to the nearest contour on each side of your road. The rise will equal the difference between the two contours this line touches. Say your road width crosses 3 contours the closest to one edge is 4947 the closest to the other edge is 4950. Your rise will equal 3'. The run will be the length of you line. Say your road is 24' wide but to touch the closest contour you had to extend your line 2' on one side and 3' on the other. This will make your run 2'+3'+24'=29'. 3/29=0.1034x100 gives you a 10.34% cross slope on your road.  

To figure out the actual elevations at the side of your road trim out the middle part of this line leaving the 2' and 3' extension lines off the side of you road. We'll say the 2' line goes from the side of your road down to the 4947 elevation. Multiply 2 by your x-slope of .1034 and then add it to the 4947 elevation because your road is slightly above this elevation. 2x0.1034=0.2069 + 4947=4947.2069 so this tells you the elevation on the low side of your road is 4947.21. For the other side of your road multiply 3(extension off road) x 0.1034 (cross slope)=0.31032. This time you need to subtract this number from the 4950 elevation because your road is slightly below this contour 4950-0.31032=4949.69.

Here's a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/Hbm8H) of what I'm trying to explain. Once you get all of your elevations you'll just need to draw a grid to draw your cross sections on. So it should be at least 24' wide to show the width of your road and 5' or so tall to show the elevations at each side of your road. You'll draw a line on this grid 24' wide going from  the 4949.69 elevation down to the 4947.21 elevation for this particular cross section. I would make the middle of your grid 0' and then offset it at least 12' in each direction at 1' intervals.  ","1343780454"

&gt; Whether it's a waste of money and time is strictly your opinion.

It's a question of fact, which could be answered objectively though I don't have the data and I'm guessing. Do these programs lower crime?  For the resources they consume do they lower crime more than alternatives? Etc.

&gt; Are those people thieves, yes. Is it the police's job to arrest thieves, yes. 

It's also the polices jobs to arrest people who commit a multitude of other crimes of varying magnitude. If some old law was on the books which made it a felony to drive without shoes on with a member of the opposite sex in the car, would you support a crackdown?  Why not? It's a crime and the job of the police is to arrest people who commit crimes.   After all, the nice thing about shoeless mixed gendered motoring is that it's pretty cut and dry... etc. 

I think the job of the police is, in fact, not to arrest theieves.  The job of the police, as well as every civil servant, is to make the community a safer and more productive place for everyone including piece of shit criminals.  One way they can do this is, often, by locking up thieves— because the harm to them of locking them up is easily offset by preventing and discouraging theft.  But I think that every action still must be held accountable to the higher goal of advancing the community interest. And catching retards with implausible bait?  It just seems like a fun way to generate attention and to look more productive than they might actually be.

"funny","t5_2qh33","That's pretty awful advertisement. Neither Victoria's Secret nor Dove are trying to promote social agendas or anything of the sort. They're trying to sell product.

VS is selling an image. You buy our lingerie, and you'll look this good! That works for people buying high end lingerie, because you're buying it to look good and feel sexy. Otherwise you'd buy granny panties out of the Walmart bargain bin.

When you're buying soap, you don't care about beauty. You care about cleanliness. Cleanliness provides us comfort. You know that feeling just after you get out of the shower and you lay on your clean bedsheets on a Saturday morning? Yeah, that feeling is what they're selling. Women, who don't have ""perfect"" bodies posing nude evokes comfort. And of course you have people like the OP who will buy the product on principle, assuming that Dove has any agenda beyond selling product; they're banking on that too.

They'll continue photoshopping because it serves the purpose of selling product. If they stop photoshopping, it'll be because market research tells them that un-shopped images sell more product, not because of any social reasons.

e: I tend to agree that our perception of body image is somewhat warped (as this entire thread is a testament to), and it is certainly the fault of marketing in a large way, but they aren't going to change their position because of that. Marketing has one goal of selling products, and they'll do that in the most efficient way they can. It's best to regard any marketing material with that knowledge so that as a consumer you can make informed purchasing decisions.","1343780465"

"Denver","t5_2qn3i","I live off of West Colfax. I'm a 5min bike ride from Auraria Campus. It's much cheaper here than Capitol Hill – rather it's about the same but you get more over here. I'm paying $900 for a row house, 1 bedroom but about 1,000 sq. feet, fenced yard, 2 car garage, plenty of parking in addition to the garage. My neighbors place is smaller, maybe 550 sq feet but has a fenced yard and garage as well. He pays $600. The area gets a bad rap because it used to be pretty shady, but It's rapidly gentrifying. Likewise the Auraria neighborhood just south of campus. There are a lot of housing projects along Mariposa St. in that neighborhood so try to stay closer to Santa Fe st. 

Capitol Hill is fun if your young and like to go out on foot or bike a lot and don't mind driving around for 45 minutes looking for a parking space, and living in a smallish place for $700 but it's definitely no ""safer"" than the west side – a lot more petty crime and street level drug dealing. I know several people who've been mugged in Cap Hill.  Over here on the west side it's more gang related crime which, if you're not in a gang, and good at minding your own business, doesn't impact you. 

Lower Highlands is close to campus and is really nice, likely a little more expensive and safer than West Colfax and Capitol Hill. Likewise Uptown could be good if you'd live in a high-rise or condo.

If safe to you means suburban – i.e. no crime ever – then Glendale, as mentioned, or along the South light-rail line. Or there is a new west Lightrail starting next year that goes out to Lakewood which is also really cheap and safe. 

*I should ad that on the whole Denver is safe for a city. The worst neighborhood in Denver is WAAaaayyy safer than a bad neighborhood in Buffalo NY or Jacksonville Fl. not to mention Chicago, LA... Campus is right smack dab downtown so to live walking distance you either have to pay $$$ for utter safety in a downtown high-rise or live in a lower income neighborhood like mine or a high density urban area like Cap Hill. If you go 3-4 miles S, E, or W (not N) it's likely really really safe. ","1343780465"

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","&gt;No doubt, a religion is not just it's highest philosophical tenants but neither is it manufactured dogma of it's adherents

I didn’t have time to fully address this earlier but I wanted to take issue with your idea that a religion can have ""highest tenants"".  That statement has an enormous amount of bias that needs looking at.

Lets pretend we are aliens visiting this world for the first time and observing humans. Better yet we can time travel and view the activities of humans over their entire short history.  One thing we would notice is that most humans performed rituals to effect magic in ways to improve their circumstances in this life or a perceived afterlife.  They would often do this within the context of organized social groups that defined a cosmology and accepted ritual practices.  That’s what we would define as religion.  We would probably notice also that a few nerds sat it universities or monasteries pontificating on abstract philosophical topics and a few others would engage in other activities to induce mystical experiences but we would not consider those actives indicative of average or the most impactful religious action.

So how do you come by the notion that that philosophical speculation is ""higher"" or ""purer"" than the dominant religious activity of ritual behavior? It is in fact a totally arbitrary value judgment on your part. You as an intellectual may have more affinity for that aspect of religion but there is nothing more inherently primary, special, important or pure about that type of religious activity.

We watched the fucking shit out of Star Wars. And it was 3 in the morning when we finished Episode VI. We were grinning like idiots at the end and sang along with the closing theme. And then you know what we did.

We sat up until 6 in the morning talking about Star Wars. It was absolutely freezing and god knows we should have gotten close and freaky under the covers, but we were having so much fun arguing over who was the best character (we all know it's Han) and making up our own theories and argued about how awful the Prequels are. 

Those were the best days of my life. I have never played KOTOR, I have never played anything other than Star Wars Battlefront on the XBOX in relation to Star Wars games, I haven't watched the movies since that night. I just kindly ask that you gift me The Knights of the Old Republic, so I can show the same girl I joked with about her striking resemblance to Jabba the Hutt a new game that she might be interested in playing, so we can once again joke about the stupid shit we'd spent a whole night doing a year or so ago.

However, I'm still against the federal government. It does some good, and has the capacity to do more, but it builds that good on a heapin' helpin' of hurt. The fact that there is actually a job in this country where one person can decide who lives and who dies based on rumors? Sounds like cockamamie nonsense to me. Harmful cockamamie nonsense.

And the fact that the government isn't limited by the laws it makes for me really puts in my head the idea that these people aren't my legal representatives, and couldn't be even if I elected them. Add to that the fact that I don't know who elected these people anyway, unless every voter in the country (who actually votes) is forced to put O'Bombney 2012 stickers on their foreheads. But of course, that won't happen, because they're supposed to be anonymous by law.

So now I live in a place where violent, uniformed men go around authorizing the shooting of pets and the blinding, beating, shocking and shooting of people for smoking or selling marijuana. In other words, for doing something that's actually harmless and is only so harshly punished because the punishers claim the right to do so by being granted it from a faceless, invisible authority. And said authority can't be challenged, except by accepting its claim on my life and hopefully speaking out in meek enough tones that I won't be labeled by the public as a lost ~~soul~~ cause. As someone who doesn't *believe* in G-VT. As a sinful, heretical anarchist.

"politics","t5_2cneq","If an oil company has a union and the workers vote to run ads against Green Peace, it's not the same thing as the union suits or the oil company executives making that decision. That's what I'm saying.

&gt;Because I'm sure all the teachers get to participate, none of them are pressured to vote specific ways, and everyone agrees so nobody is forced to pay to represent people/causes they disagree with.

Paranoia gets you nowhere in this discussion.

&gt;Why not let the teachers choose to donate to the political ads, if they really believe that's the best way for their money to be spent?

Probably for the same reason the government doesn't let people choose whether or not to pay their taxes. When it's an individual choice, very few people participate, and everyone loses out, but when everyone knows they're in it together, a lot more money is raised and the goal is reached. But that was a good question, and perfectly reasonable to debate about. The thing is, just like the question of being able to opt out of the union, it's unrealistic. You can't benefit from the union, working alongside union employees under the conditions they bargained for and then not pitch in. It just doesn't work, in my opinion. But I wonder if you fight just as hard for the right of non-union workers to unionize?

&gt;A good teacher should make a hell of a lot more than they do now. I just think bad teachers should be able to be fired, and poor kids should be able to go to same schools the rich kids get to go to. Fuck me, right?

Your problem is that you're not well-informed about this stuff, and you ignore people who are well-informed. I've talked to you about this stuff before, and you didn't want to listen. Bad teachers can be fired, good teachers aren't helped by union-busting, privatization or standardized testing (which is what the anti-union folks have been pushing), and studies show that vouchers don't help the poor. Fuck you? No. Fuck ignorance. Fuck ignoring what teachers have been saying and listening instead to politicians and rich businessmen. ","1343780485"

They aren't even close.  The Galaxy S3 is definitely still a phone.  I think this kind of logic would be sound if you were looking at the Note, but its simply not the case with the S3.


&gt;as I already own an iPhone, I already have an Apple Store account, a lot of apps (paid for or not), so if I take an SGS3, I'd have to give up my different apps (even though I might find some similar ones on Google Play ...)

Yes, but you are already have one Android device which you will be buying apps for.  Almost any app you buy for the Nexus 7 will work on an Android phone.

"Libertarian","t5_2qh63","You posit some interesting questions.

&gt;is it cool for me to set up an immigration business where I ""marry"" people for a fee to help them get a green card for being married to a citizen?

I'm no expert, but what's stopping heterosexual men and women from doing that now?

&gt;What are the rules for joint tax filing if there are twenty spouses in a marriage rather than two?

This is not a discussion on the legitimacy of polygamy.  This is a discussion on the legitimacy of homosexual marriage.  What's stopping you from doing that now is largely based on state laws, no?

&gt;I don't think your solution is as simple as you think.

It is.  It really, really is.  We're talking about something as simple as offering the same benefits to two people of the same gender as we do to two people of the opposing gender.  What's stopping heterosexual couples from corrupting the process the way homosexual marriage could? 

Also, consider why it just makes sense from a business standpoint.  As long as marriage is run by the state, it'll be beneficial for homosexual marriage to be allowed, economically.

Take [Maryland](http://escholarship.org/uc/item/7q28k8q6) for example.  The economic impact of gay marriages in Maryland should lead to a net gain of 3.2 million dollars each year to the state budget.  The gain is attributable to savings in expenditures on means-tested public-benefit programs and an increase in sales and lodging tax revenue from weddings and wedding-related tourism.  Come November 6th, should the people approve it, gay marriage should lead to a significant economic boost for a state known for its blighted urban regions.

I started around spring of 1943 and we were let go after VE Day sometime before summer 1945. 
Speaking of love, I was asked out by my (married) foreman at the factory, and also by at least one guy who worked there, I am not sure why he wasn't at the war because he seemed fine.

The economy was brought down, in large part, due to banks fucking with mortgages.  Part of what they were doing was selling mortgages, and thusly changing ownership of the deeds, very rapidly.  Since the paperwork takes time to complete, and the banks were trading and selling very rapidly, the banks lost track of who held the deed.  Since the deed denotes ownership, this is a big deal.  In order to work around this problem, the banks forged information saying they owned the deed.  Then, years later, when people couldn't make the absurdly high payments they owed, the banks decided to take back 'their' property.  Except they couldn't supply a deed, because they never legally obtained it.  And nobody really knows who owns the land without having to shovel through paperwork and trace back the various trades and whatnot.

So I ask you this.  If selling property you don't own is impossible, and forging information regarding the ownership of said property is illegal, then how did these banks not break the law?  At BEST they **should have known** there was illegal activity.  At worst, they willingly committed fraud.","1343780512"

"science","t5_mouw","Look I apologize if I sound like a jerk - but you are spreading so much misinformation in this post that I had to jump in and say something. CCD is NOT caused by pesticides and pesticides alone. Pesticides KILL insects. One of the major CCD symptoms is a complete absence of bees altogether. Nothing dead anywhere. Not a body to be found. Pesticides, while harmful to insects (which is their intended purpose) is definitely NOT the sole cause of CCD. Which pesticides are you even talking about? Neonics? If so, look at Illinois - neonics are used extensively throughout the state and yet there has not been a CCD case here in recent memory. In fact, I swear it's only been 1 case in 10 years or so. The health of the honeybee is not nearly as bad as it was in years past. Check the latest research.

Your claim about management techniques was correct only to the point about driving bees from one side of the country to the other - it places unneeded stress on a colony, which probably does not contribute to its overall health - but the rest of your claims don't seem to make any sense either. Do you have any research to back up the claims that we can read? ","1343780513"

I fantasize about that every night before I sleep and it takes away from this horrible country we call the *land of the free*.  ""I want you inside of me, Neil"" I yell out to him.  He makes a witty science related pun before removing his space themed tie.  He flips me over and tears off my clothes. He tosses my pocket protector to the ground and folds up my Linux-based laptop.  ""I'm going to pound that sweet pale ass with my Large Hadron Collider"" he tells me before tearing apart my underwear like the incredible black Hulk of a man that he is.  ""TAKE ME NEIL! TAKE ME TO THE MOON!!""  I moan with pleasure.  His thick, black cock is large and throbbing and I want it inside of me. INJECT ME with your logic and REASON!  He looks down at me the with that sensual and sexy gaze and runs his fingers through his fro.  With one thrust he is deep inside of me. It hurts. But it hurts so good. Thrust after thrust he goes deeper and faster. ""FUCK ME NEIL!"" I shout. He fucks me asshole harder and harder. 

#####Hours pass and he's still slamming me with his powerful, throbbing cock of Science.  He grunts  and spanks me.  ""Who's your gOD?"" he shouts. I reply ""gOD's NOT REAL!!""

#####""gOD'S NOT REAL""

#####""I am so ready"" I reply with wet anticipation. By this point my neckbeard is dripping with sweat and there are dozens of empty cans of Mountain Dew on the bedroom floor, consumed by Tyson as he fucked my asshole.  My back is covered in orange Dorito-stained hand prints.

#####NDT gives one final thrust into the caverns of my anus and ejaculates a wave of logic inside of me. ""PRAISE SAGAN!"" he screams in pleasure.  It feels so good. I never want the feeling to end.  He pulls out and flops next to me on the bed.  After buttoning up his shirt he says one final thing to me; ""Strong. Then kill"". As he left my bedroom, a couple of the cart boys started to whistle and cheer, soon shoppers joined in and even the cashier. He gave a wave and went off with a feeling of accomplishment.

"whatsthisbug","t5_2s3bw","More bad news:  german roaches fucking suck.  

Their reproductive cycle is *crazy fast*, to the point where in order to actually effectively control an infestation, you need to eradicate no less than *95%* of their total population or else they'll just bounce right back.  
They're a really fucking hardy species and *horribly* resistant to most forms of pest control - once again, they breed *crazy fast* and produce a monstrous amount of young per breeding cycle.  
They are also, as you've noticed, quite small, considerably smaller than American or Oriental roaches, meaning they're really good at *hiding*.  They can fit in itty bitty little cracks and wait out your attempts to murder them.  

Even more bad news:

One of the worst parts about a german roach infestation is the smell - when excited or startled, they'll give off a *really* nasty reek.  If you've been noticing any terrible smells around your apartment, that's them. 

Count this as a second vote for *just move*.  

Meanwhile, keep your shit as clean as you can - they love meat, grease and sugar but will eat literally fucking anything - including each other - if they absolutely need to.  
They hate the cold, so start keeping everything you want to be assured is roach-free in the fridge, if you have to.

And move the fuck out.

"AskHistorians","t5_2ssp3","I think you are not talking about the lack of general intellectual thought, right? Though if you are, lavalampmaster is very right. Tocqueville believed our society was discouraging to enlightenment.

If you are talking about our cultural ignorance and the world's perception of us believing the world revolves around us, my theory is that this is a fairly new phenomenon, but not really. Let me explain.

A lot of Americans are blindly patriotic and very ignorant of other cultures (read: 'MERICUH IS THE BEST). But this is due to a number of factors. In Europe, there is a lot more cultural mixing, and a lot of history overlaps. There are a lot of regions housing many different cultures, but there was never a dominant power. For example, Germans and French living in Alsace-Lorraine remained mostly their own culture although switching nations from time to time. Therefore, modern Europe is educated very well regarding overall European history, which includes 46 nations other than their own. (I am aware they are educated more on American history than we are on European history) Here, American history is taught, which revolves around mostly just us. The Canadians aren't very different from us anyway, and Mexico is just about the only truly different culture from us. And we hardly consider them peers. I'm not being racist, just being realistic. Where France and Germany may consider themselves ""rival"" powers in a sense that they must respect each other, the poorer infrastructure and lesser economy and military in Mexico has (WRONGLY) led some Americans to simply believe they are better. This, along with a lack of other regional powers, engenders a feeling of American superiority and the fact that the world revolves around us.

Furthermore, although we have had a lot of immigration and ethnically can consider ourselves diverse, the fact is we want most of them to assimilate to American culture. This is different from Europe. I'm an Asian-American, but except for my physical differences am pretty much American. Immigrants from other continents in Europe probably undergo something similar. But the amount of mixing in between European cultures means that French people in Germany can pretty much remain French, especially if they live close to the border. Europeans learn bits and pieces of other European languages simply from the amount of interaction that they have with each other. All of this leads to a much more cosmopolitan society, meaning the Europeans are fairly aware of the culture and languages and customs of their neighbors. America is not. (FWIW, a lot of Americans are quite aware of Mexican culture and customs; most schools teach Spanish as a second language, and Cinco de Mayo is pretty big here, too.)

However, this could possibly have a deeper root. In the Victorian era, when the USA began emerging as a power, the middle class in America was much stronger. Built on our economic strength, the middle class had significant power and the foreign world saw a lot of the middle class, whereas in Europe their power was projected by the aristocracy and economic elite. In that era it is safe to say the American middle class was more educated about foreign cultures than the European majority of poor uneducated laborers and farmers and craftsmen. However, the world never saw any of the poor class of Europe (or America, for what its worth). For example, immigration of the poor aside, why would any European vacation to America unless they were rich? Yet the American upper middle class COULD afford to go to Europe for pleasure, although not remotely close to the accessibility today of course. And compared to the European elite, of course the American middle class were probably not as educated. Therefore, in the Victorian era and early 20th century, the European elite viewed the Americans as perhaps more culturally ignorant, while the truth (OF THE TIME) was that the majority of Europeans were more ignorant. This was a time when American education and literacy was on the rise and soon would be rated among the best in the world. But of course the bigger factor would probably be the general geographic isolation of the Americans in relation to Europe.

TL;DR It's a matter of geographical isolation and distance that has led America to have a reputation of cultural ignorance.","1343780526"

2. If you're going to work on the web you will need to know its 3 client side languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There's no way around them. And generating those languages with tools will only get you into trouble. (JavaScript is not Java)

3. Besides the 3 client side languages you will need to know some server side technologies. I will recommend using a web framework on top of a programming language because the alternative would be to reinvent the wheel at every step, and you don't know enough web programming to do it. Some alternatives are Python with Django, Ruby with Ruby on Rails, C# with ASP.NET MVC, and PHP with Symfony. 

4. You will also need a persistence layer. For now use whatever database the web framework that you choose uses.

5. If you need something ready right now instead of in a few months then you might want to use a prefab CMS like Wordpress or Drupal instead of learning points 3 and 4. They have plenty of plugins that will be useful to you. But if you're going to create anything unique you won't be able to skip those two steps.

Plus, the rigors of his program means he is more fatigued than his competitors as well-- all in a sport where winners are determined by hundredths or tenths of seconds.  Truly magnificent.

It would be the equivalent of Usain Bolt winning the 100 the 200, the 400 and the hurdles at multiple distances.

Phelps now has 19 medals, 15 golds.  Here are the next best in swimming:

Overall medals: three have 12 (Jenny Thompson, Dara Torres, and Natalie Coughlin).

Golds:  Spitz has 9

Swimming may have more opportunities than most sports, but he's shattered what any other swimmer has done.  And he's calling it quits at 27 years old, where he could probably rack up more medals in 2016.","1343780531"

You are MOST welcome!  =)   


&gt;It's so comforting to hear that someone else has gone through this...It'd be fantastic if my SO and I could go through this together,  

i think that time will come.  Even though you are going through it earlier now, you will get to be with him when he does and it will be thrilling for you!!  See his mind open up and you can show him what you have learned.  In a sense you will still get to do it together.  Maybe not today, but eventually.  

&gt;Especially to hear how happy you both are despite all the rebuilding that had/has to be done, the trials and everything.  

Good!!  Im also being very honest, im not sugar-coating anything, (we have all had enough of that in our lives).  But again, the weight lifted off our marriage is insane.  We feel like it can be US and we can do what we want WHEN we want.  If wanna go party with people from work or the gym, we can!  If we wanna go hiking with them, we can!  No guilty feelings because of association, just simply unadulterated fun and friends!   
  

&gt; I will try very hard to keep your words in mind and follow your advice.   

Please do!  Mine and everyone elses, this is a great community and you will find more unconditional love here than the hall i assure you.    

&gt; I will PM as more thoughts arise...Still not even sure what I have to know at this point.  

And that is OK!  Take it at your own pace.  Those two sources i listed have been absolutely stunning and eye opening for my wife and I.  The book is written by an ex-governing body member, he tells things like he saw them, not with bitterness or anger at all.  But his experiences highlight how NOT spirit-directed the org is.  JWfacts is nice because it has just that, FACTS, easily verifiable with other sources and your own experiences.  Poke around there.  I have the crisis of conscience E-book, if you need it i'd be more than happy to send it to you.  

But again, if you have any questions about the whole ""process"" and dont want to make an entire post about it, contact me, if youd rather talk to my wife i can put you in contact with her as well.  Dont get discouraged, this isnt the easiest path and you have a lot to lose, but its worth it, the mental and physical freedom is like nothing you know if you grew up in the truth.

"GuildWars","t5_2quyl","I think it is mostly a matter of what the other skills are. 

To use AR+FA you need a larger mana pool and will struggle a bit if you are heavy on the side of mana-costing chants/shouts as opposed to adrenaline-only shouts. However, once it gets going, it is very strong and requires little upkeep but you will nevertheless encounter mana issues. The low adrenaline cost is why many IMBAgon builds for DoA and other areas use AR+FA (with ""For Great Justice"" too, which is another 100%) instead of SF - because ""Save Yourselves!"" cost 8 adrenaline each time. Conversely, if a build NEEDS a ton of adrenaline, AR+FA is often the only way. One of the only reliable ways to get a heavy permenant +% to adrenaline is also FA, so that is a big plus.

On the other hand SF only costs 5 mana total, which is a 7 fold decrease from AR+FA. The more mana you need for your skills, the better SF as a choice becomes. Adrenaline gain is lowered, however, so many of the best paragon Spear Mastery skills that require a lot of adrenaline would clash with your build if your upkeep shout/chant also costs adrenaline. However, this could be complimented with +adrenaline skills. It really just depend on your other skills. But like it was mentioned above, the other +adrenaline skills just don't really compare with FA.

I personally have found AR+FA a nuisance to use because it costs too much mana. But it should be noted that I let my heroes clear the dungeon and afk most of the time. I click a few buttons, watch tv, and come back. I get annoyed if I my heroes start wiping and I spent all my mana on AR and couldn't use ""We Shall Return!"" Nevertheless, I still think AR+FA is superior.","1343780536"

Ultimately it may become necessary to use a more elaborate model if you require better accuracy.  For transistor models, you typically move next to controlled source models, and then to custom non-linear models.  The latter require having the source code of simulators like SPICE  or a SPICE that supports plug-ins.  In either case, new models can be tricky at that level because most people can't think in the multi-dimensional space or its 1st 2-3 derivatives intuitively so they leave something out of the mathematics added and it causes simulation stability problems.  The history MOSFET models in SPICE is rife with this kind of problem.

Creating a non-SPICE custom program (e.g. in C, etc.) is usually the jumping-off point for creating built-in SPICE models for nonlinear components.","1343780541"

This has served us great but we're looking to expand and be able to do more portrait studio photography for head shots and kids pictures and basically anything else a client may ask for.

I've been looking into many different websites about building your own studio on the cheap, or buy a cheap set up and upgrading as needed. Is there any place where I can order an affordable start up studio set? I've found some on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/CowboyStudio-Photography-Studio-Monolight-Lighting/dp/B001NY1UJM/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1343780426&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=photography+studio), but I'm sure if that would be an OK starting point.

"funny","t5_2qh33","Marriage is ingrained in culture going back thousands of years.  The word has weight and import.  Civil Unions are ""less than"" what, culturally, most people aspire to.  If, for some bizarre reason, every country changes the definition of legal marriage to the phrase ""civil union"" -- guess what -- people will still call it ""marriage"".  Changing the word simply isn't practical.  Seriously: try to pass a law banning people calling all cola ""Coke"" or all tissues ""Kleenex"" or all photocopies ""Xerox"" regardless of brand.  People are going to use the word they want.

It makes a whole lot more sense to simply define marriage as the legal, contractual union of two consenting adults.  We're already there.  We just need to remove gender restrictions.  If a couple then decide to have a religious ceremony (or not!) after procuring a marriage license that is their private business.  And guess what -- it already works this way.  You don't have to do a damn blessed thing to make it work this way except remove gender restrictions.  Yay Occam's Razor!

People advocating the removal of ""marriage"" from all laws are actually advocating more changes to government structure than has occurred in all of our lifetimes.","1343780544"

"science","t5_mouw","Ah, I see.  That type of beekeeping is less widespread here but I can see it being problematic and probably not s great for the bees.

Although just to address a couple of your points:

&gt;to pollinate monoculture after monoculture

It doesn't really matter to the bee's, they are harvesting pollen or nectar which all pollinating plants provide.  They do show preferences to certain types of plants over others but I'm not sure if that is to do with taste or the fact the plants provide more pollen or nectar in comparison to others.  However hives close to single types of flower/plant/trees rarely venture far afield to other food sources, so I would guess taste variance is not much of an issue.

&gt;all the while being fed corn syrup on the they're being driven from destination to destination. Poor nutrition is going to have an impact on any organism.

Well nectar is really just sugar water, corn syrup is pretty much the same.  Bee's get protein from pollen and they are very adapt at storing and balancing their needs.  Consider bees here in Ireland, there can be weeks of rain stopping the bees gathering nectar or pollen, and while they may occasionally need assistance that is not usually the case.  Considering the bees are taken to orchards or crops during the times when those food sources would be most active, I'm pretty sure the bee's would adapt and
store what they needed during the times they could not forage (during transport).

Although those are just assumptions as I have no experience with such types of beekeeping.","1343780551"

If someone started talking about praying to leprechauns or unicorns, the general public would laugh in their face.  These creationists are no different, except that enough people have given them an audience that they now actually want to push that nonsense in our very own schools.  

You mention Climate Change (please stop calling it Global Warming, that's a misnomer).

People existed before government and they owned things before government.

So you get a bunch of people together and form a government and tell everyone you want a tax to build a road even though the roads that were created by people privately are good enough.  but now you tell people they have to pay a tax or go to jail because they aren't violent and you are.

The Audi might have been trying to pass one car because two cars cannot be passed safely, or at least it's more difficult to pass two cars safely because you need more space and more visibility. 

Furthermore, it drives me up the wall when people driving slowly on roads like this speed up significantly in the only areas where it is safe to pass (straightaways with good visibility).

Failure isn't getting turned down for a job, it's getting fired because you found out too late a promise you can't deliver on helps no one.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","&gt;so theoretically if I knew exactly how many protons and electrons where in two objects I'd be able to calculate their electromagnetic attraction to each other?

Basically, although things get more complicated if the charges can move around when inteacting with each other. How difficult this is depends on the exact situation.

Most large-scale objects like the sun don't have any electrostatic attration to each other because they have a net zero charge. Technically they have some small force coming from higher multipoles due to the fact the charges are not all in a single point, but for most neutral objects this is very small indeed.

Some objects can be statically charged (like a balloon), in which case thier exact charge is dependent on the situation. Some objects, like carbon atoms, are deformable (their charges can be moved around appreciably), so they can induce higher multipoles in each other while interacting.

It really depends on exactly what you want to do, what your goal is. If you could be more specific someone might be able to suggest something.","1343780570"

"nba","t5_2qo4s","**Lesser known rules** 

Three seconds: this rule is in place to stop defenses from cramming in the paint to protect the rim. The NBA has an offensive 3 seconds in place to spread the game out. This adds an element of finesse to the game so faster players (guards and forwards) can speed up the game on the perimeter.

Goaltending: The defensive team is not allowed to touch the ball after a shot after the attempt has reached the pinnacle of its arc. If this rule weren't in place, practically any NBA player (and other world class basketball players) could simply time a jump to intercept the ball before it went in the basket. Also, in case of a shot hitting the rim, no player may touch the ball when it is within the plane of the cylinder of the hoop. This means the offense can't tip in the ball when it's still rolling on the rim. Nor can the defense tip it out.

Jump Ball: When two players of opposite teams have possession of the ball, a jump ball is called. The results depend on the league. In the NBA, the entangled players stand at the free throw line and do a tip ball (like the beginning of the game) to determine possession. In lower class leagues (especially in kids basketball) these are common, but as athletes become more refined and handle the ball better, these occur infrequently. Most jump balls happen when there is a loose ball or rebound.


**Late Game Tactics**

These are some of the more confusing aspects of a basketball game for outsiders. Teams behind foul their opponents when time becomes a factor. This is why.

There's a shot clock in most (if not all) professional leagues, so neither team sits on the ball when they have the lead. This rule, again, speeds up the game. In the NBA, each possession lasts a maximum of 24 seconds, which can be reset off of an offensive rebound that touches the rim. In the last few minutes of a game, the team with the lead would like to slow down the game as much as possible so there is less scoring, so they can maintain their lead. Most of the time, depending on the situation, teams told the ball until there is ~10 seconds left, and then they go for a shot. At some point in the game, the losing team cannot afford to lose these 24 seconds every time the opponent gets the ball. They make a calculated risk: they give the leading team a chance at 2 points off of free throws in exchange for the ball without losing valuable time. Free throws, while considered relatively easy, are sometimes missed in the clutch time, giving the losing team a chance. ","1343780573"

"networking","t5_2qkaf","Here's what I do.  I don't know if it's ""right"" or not, but it works for me.

I snap a picture of every switch, router, server, etc.

I annotate them with numbers (ie: port 1, eth0, etc).

Then, I put all of these pictures in a wiki and write some documentation.

This makes for detailed, easy to maintain (save layers in photoshop) diagrams and documentation.

For IP assignments, I wrote a SNMP program in PHP to monitor my networks.  I think that Nagios will do this too, but here's how this app works:

The program scans my networks once a day, around noon.  If it discovers a new device, it tries to query description and location MIB's, then it e-mails me a list of all new IP's and any information it found out about the devices.

The bottom of the e-mail has a link to a very basic web interface.  I used an off-the-shelf, free UI to make a simple table HTML / javascript table.

The table lists the description, device name, group number, ... etc ... , and IP address.

For new devices, the IP addresses (and other information) is automatically added.  I can edit the table right on the web page to insert additional information.  I can add un-used IP addresses to this table for things like DHCP blocks, etc.  The group number exists so that I can group blocks of addresses or devices together.  Have a cluster of servers?  Group them.

Now, this whole thing may sound complicated, but it's not.  It's a very simple mysql database with a web based front end that someone else wrote.  The SNMP poller is the only (somewhat) complicated thing, but even this... I borrowed heavily from online code snips.

So... for me... pictures act as easy-to-read documentation.  A very simple database that tells me when it needs to be updated keeps IP's in line.","1343780575"

So what do the record companies actually do to promote artists?  I mean, aside from chucking cash behind a band they think they'll be able to recoup their money from.  And in order to do that they have to flood major market radio stations with the bands songs.  Dunno about you, but if I want to find new music, a ClearChannel music station isn't what I'd listen to.

In terms of exposing people to new artists, I'd say technology can do a better job of that.

Red certainly did the most damage, but was very slow, and additionally slows down your movement speed. This impeddence can be somewhat off set by dragging the saber (moving you screen counter to the blade), but ultimately it can be countered very effectively by blue. Blue gives you enough speed an mobility, to get in and out dealing damage to red users, additionally, if you drag it, you can actually do more damage than a single red attack. For this reason most mods actually nerf blues damage to 15 from 25 like it was in base. However, blue has limied range which is where yellow comes in. Yellow has very long diagonals and actually does more damage than blue (30), additionally, if you drag it you can get up to three hits on a single swing (90 dmg!). For this reason yellow is often times the serious duelers style of choice as it offers the mobility of blue, while still giving good reach and not locking you into moves as long as red. If you notice the pattern here, red in fact counters yellow with it's longer reach. Because you can out reach yellow, you can actually interrupt it.

A lot of people didnt seem to notice that it was a rock,paper, scizzors duel system and instead just always went for rock. Alternatively many people were taught as you were taoist, which while effective, doesn't always cover the full range of possibilities.

Nothing is an abstract term to symbolize the lack of something. It is not used to reference something.

* 152              Cato the Elder continuously demands Carthaginian destruction on the Senate floor. Cato noticed the trend of Carthage bouncing back from whatever destruction Rome forced upon her.
* 152 - 151      Carthage sends ambassadors to Rome, upon arrival they hear Rome's demands; ""if the Carthaginians give satisfaction to the Romans"" war might be averted. Vague at best.
* 151             Utica suddenly throws it support behind the Romans! Carthage's eldest ally! Imagine the shock that the Carthaginians must be feeling by now.
* 150- 149               Rome officially declares war upon Carthage. Carthage was out more important allies. Rome could smell the underdefended riches of Carthage.
* 149          A fleet of 50 quinqueremes and 100 smaller warships carrying 80,000 footsoldiers and 4000 horse cross the small strech of sea between Sicily and North Africa.
* 149         A desperate Carthaginian ambassador contacts the Romans and tries to negotiate a deal. The Roman concept (deditio in fi dem) was much like the one applied to Germany and Japan in 1945. The surrendering side put itself absolutely into the other’s power and must submit to whatever the victors imposed. The Carthaginians certainly knew this standard Roman practice, nor had their own habits been very different in their Greek Sicilian wars.
* 149      Long year, I know ;&lt;. Roman demands arrive! Now the Romans did start a cat-and-mouse game. The consuls in
Sicily fi rst required three hundred children of the city’s leading
families to be handed over to them as hostages. They then sailed
over to Utica in full strength, where the Carthaginians at their
demand delivered all their military stores – no fewer than 200,000
sets of armour, 2000 pieces of artillery, and other weapons. Then
came a last demand: the citizens must leave their city and settle 80
stadia, about 16 kilometres, inland. The fi gure was not realistic, for
it would have placed a quarter of a million Carthaginians along the
diffi cult range of heights stretching from Tunes to the Bagradas. It
really meant any distance that the Romans would judge convenient,
leaving the city to be plundered and demolished.


Unacceptable.

*"" Carthage exploded with anger and outrage, vividly recorded by
Appian. The unfortunate envoys who came back to report the
ultimatum were lynched by furious crowds, as were senators who
had urged appeasement. Resident Italians were manhandled or
killed. On the same day, the adirim declared war, freed the slaves in
the city, and sent an appeal for aid to the recently-condemned
Hasdrubal – now commanding 30,000 troops in the countryside and
probably shadowing Masinissa. The other Hasdrubal, Masinissa’s
grandson, was elected general too and took command in the city.
Temples and squares became ad hoc weapons workshops; women
cut off their hair to make cords for catapults. The Romans meanwhile
marched down from Utica to open the siege. Masinissa, it seems,
retired to Cirta to watch. ""* 

Good news!

*""The siege of Carthage lasted three years. Her 23 Roman miles (34
kilometres) of walls – including the triple line across the fl at isthmus
outside Megara – defeated repeated assaults from the isthmus, the
sea and the lakeshore. The citizens within the walls were not
completely alone. The forgiven Hasdrubal operated in the countryside
with his army, while Hippacra, Nepheris and Clupea-Aspis near
Cape Bon held out too. According to Appian, the Romans were
supported locally only by Utica and (on the east coast) Hadrumetum,
Leptis, Thapsus and Acholla. Hasdrubal was able to send
supplies in to the besieged, and until the summer of 147 foreign
merchants could still reach the city despite the Roman blockade.
Parts of Megara itself were probably cultivated for food""*

* 148       Piso, the consul in
command, spent that summer failing to capture Hippacra,
while on Masinissa’s death the Numidian lord Bithyas with his 800
horsemen joined Hasdrubal’s army. Carthaginian spokesmen moved
around Libya encouraging resistance. By now discipline in the
besieging army was badly deteriorating due to setbacks and poor
leadership. What had promised to be a straightforward and profi table
expedition was now a war as strenuous, expensive and longlasting
as those in Spain.
* 148         The situation began, nevertheless, to worsen for the Carthaginians.
The army at Nepheris could not seriously harass Carthage’s
besiegers. Sometime in 148 its general Hasdrubal, now in the city
and suspicious or merely jealous of his namesake the grandson of
Masinissa, convinced the Carthaginians that this general – despite
his vigorous leadership – was a traitor. Masinissa’s grandson was
bludgeoned to death by his fellow citizens. More ominously still,
Scipio’s exploits during the siege gained him election as consul for 147 and the command in Africa. With him, incidentally, he brought
his friend Polybius the historian.
* 147      Scipio reinvigorated the army and the siege. New fortifi ed camps
on the isthmus cut all land communications. He frightened Hasdrubal
into abandoning Megara, built a mole out into the sea below the
southern city wall to block off the Cothon – the artifi cial ports – and
seized the ‘Falbe quadrilateral’. A small Carthaginian fl eet, built by
the citizens from leftover materials in the circular port and launched
through a channel secretly dug through to the sea alongside, was
poorly led and suffered defeat. In the city Hasdrubal became virtual
tyrant, murderously intolerant of criticism and reportedly living in
luxury with his troops while the citizens starved. Deaths and desertions
mounted dramatically. During the winter, Scipio attacked and
destroyed the army at Nepheris under its Greek (or Greek-named)
commander Diogenes and captured Nepheris itself, with up to
70,000 enemy troops and civilians reportedly killed and 10,000
taken. All of Libya now capitulated, including the Libyphoenician
loyalists such as Hippacra.      
 
* 146      No more hope for Carthage ;(.In spring 146 the Romans
launched the final assault.

* ""Attacking first through the naval port, then over the lakeshore
wall, they moved past the ‘tophet’ and Cothon to reach the agora
with its surrounding public buildings, like the senate house and the
golden – and instantly looted – temple of ‘Apollo’ (Reshef). Byrsa’s
citadel, the last refuge of thousands of surviving citizens, was
connected to the agora by three streets lined with six-storey apartment
houses where many people were still trapped. Each had to be
taken against bitter hand-to-hand resistance on every level: assault
troops reaching the upper fl oors used planks to fi ght their way across
to another while more fi ghting raged on the ground far below – a
struggle recalling the horrors of Dionysius’ capture of Motya. Once
his men reached the walls of Byrsa, Scipio had all the houses along
these streets destroyed to clear access. ""*

*""Next day, the seventh since the assault began, Byrsa capitulated.
The last Carthaginians, fi fty thousand men, women and children,
came out to be enslaved. Hasdrubal and 900 Roman deserters held
out in the temple of Eshmun until the general emerged, alone, to
surrender to Scipio. In a Dantesque scene the deserters set the temple
on fi re and hurled curses on him before perishing in the fl ames. So
did his own wife, who then slew their two small sons and threw both
them and herself into the inferno.
Scipio put the city to the torch and pronounced a solemn curse on
any who might seek to dwell there. Polybius saw him weeping as he
watched Carthage’s funeral pyre: the general explained that he was
thinking that one day this could happen to Rome.""* 

**And there we lost a civilisation that was and still is one the cornerstones of Western Civilization, weather people realise it or not. After beating Carthage, Aneas son's discovered the secrets of the trade and plunder based empire over the rotting bodies of Dido's children.**

"explainlikeimfive","t5_2sokd","&gt; What are the implications of selling a home prior to paying the entirety of it off? I know taxation would be a big one but is it really as simple as finding a buyer and paying off the rest of the mortgage then and there?

I think the taxation is not a big deal for most people, because of exemptions for primary residences (maybe under some value, I can't recall).  Look it up.

When you buy or sell a house, these transactions are done in a super structured fashion to take care of all these details; you don't just ask the buyer to give you the cash and then give them the house.  So what happens is that you use a specialized service called a title company that (among other things) creates an *escrow account*, controlled by the title company, to receive and make all the payments necessary to close the deal.  The buyer puts their down payment into the escrow, and their lender adds the loan money into it; once the deal closes and the ownership change is recorded with the local authorities, the escrow pays off your lender for your remaining mortgage balance, and pays you the money that's left after that.

&gt; Say I am 2 years in on a mortgage, so I am still paying mostly interest, and all of the sudden I come into a lot of cash (inherit, win, ...steal). Does it make sense to pay everything off then?

I was lucky enough to just be in a similar situation earlier this year.  The money wasn't enough to pay off the whole mortgage, but maybe about a third.  

I don't know what you know about mortgages or loans, but there is the concept of *refinancing* a loan—which means that you take a new loan in order to pay off the original one.  Why would you do this?  Well, there's three scenarios:

* Money-in refinance: the new loan is smaller than the original one; you have to put up some money of your own to pay off the original one.  People do this to reduce their mortgage amount and get better rates.
* Money-out refinance: the new loan is larger than the original one; so you get the money that is left over after paying off the old loan.  If you've heard the phrase ""use your home as an ATM,"" this is one of the  ways to do it.  While this sort of thing has gotten a bad rap in recent years, there are legitimate reasons one might do it, like serious family emergencies, home repairs or home remodeling. 
* Neither of the above.  The new loan is the same amount as the old one.  People usually do this when interest rates have gone down a lot compared to their old loan, or to switch to a different type of loan (shorter or longer term for example).

So what did I do with the extra money I got?  First, I did a money-in refinance and put in an extra 15% of the value of my house.  This reduced my debt, and it got me a much better rate: the old loan was 4.5%, the new one is 3.75%.  I put in 15% because that's the minimum I needed to put in to get the best interest rate available on the loan; I can always later decide to put in some more into the same mortgage.

Afther that I've been remodeling the house (not done yet, but nearly).  So far I've spent about 10% of its purchase value, and I may spend an extra 5%.  This makes the house nicer to live in, and also increases its value, so in a sense I'm paying myself—I'm spending money to make my house more valuable.  There's a cliché that any money you spend on your house you'll get back 150%-200% when you sell it, but I conservatively just assume that putting x dollars into the house increases the value just by that amount, and if turns out to be more then yay.

Then, when I'm done remodeling, I'll probably put the remaining money into a diversified portfolio of stock index funds and bonds.  Why?  Because I'm in my mid 30s, and I still have 30+ years to let those investments grow.  If I was in my 50s I might pay down more of the house. 

&gt; Would I have to pay the interest of the mortgage as laid out for the 30 years or would I just pay the remainder of the borrowed amount as well as the interest it would incur in that year?

No, you just pay the remaining balance and, for some loans, a prepayment penalty (for example, 3% of the loan amount if you pay it off in the first 5 years).

&gt; I feel like the 2 questions above would garner similar answers since selling the home would be sort of like coming into a lot of money suddenly - correct me if i'm wrong in this thinking..

If you have a mortgage on your house, you are legally obligated to pay it off when you sell your house.  This is one of the many reasons for the escrow account stuff I mentioned above—to guarantee that you do pay off your loans when you sell your house.

So when you sell the house you don't necessarily come into a lot of money—you get sale price minus mortgage balance (and penalties if any).","1343780584"

"Poetry","t5_2qhhu","&gt; What I consider to be cool you may not. 

While this may be true in some sense, we can't let the argument of subjectivity hinder our ability to make informed critiques. If I didn't think a poem was cool, I would explain why. And in that sense, it gives the poet a way of being able to dismiss, qualify, or embrace my comment. 

&gt; but will never produce anything great.

Under no certain terms to I disagree with the idea that some have a head start over others. But I feel that ""never"" is very strong. Wallace Stevens was the vice president of an insurance company and only started on poetry very late in his life - yet he managed to become one of the greatest modernists of America. I believe the potential is within everyone, and to reference the original point you have made, I don't feel like academia or professionalism destroys that potential. 

I can agree that some get short sighted and believe far too much in the rules they were taught, but that is a logical flaw, not a lack of creativity. But in this sense, we are delving in to belief without evidence. So perhaps we should leave it at that. ","1343780586"

The speakers I got at a garage sale in my home town for maybe $10 and the receiver I got for $5. It's an old sony 500W, probably 30 years old but works fantastically. I also have an HTPC setup with the thing, but that's adapted from a computer I already owned, and spent maybe $150 on parts to make it be a good replacement for cable. Turntable I found at goodwill for $15, but that's not in the photo. 

Garage sales are great places to pick up old audio gear. Fidelity is fidelity, and it doesn't age like image quality. The speakers I'm using are actually faaaar inferior to the ones my dad gave me, which are 35-40 years old, and some of the best sound quality I've ever experienced.

They laughed at me and said ""MATE will never go anywhere, it's a dumb fork destined for failure"".  Joke's on them now!  Sure, GNOME 3 is improving and the fallback mode has regained the capacity of ""basically useful"" but MATE provides the experience that was proven and polished for years, an interface that many people felt familiar with and had tons of features and customizations.  You don't just ditch that for some ugly redesigned tablet UI.  Sure, a lot of users like GNOME shell, but I find it a poor choice for UI design, especially on multi-monitor setups.  Cinnamon is nice, too, but for most use cases I prefer the compositor to be switchable, as compositing WM's cause a lot of issues (performance wise and window-management wise) when playing games.  For instance, full-screen works flawlessly on GNOME3 fallback/MATE, but if you turn on Compiz or switch to GNOME Shell/Cinnamon/Unity full-screen mode gets flaky (my Skype video has menu bars overlaying it, Minecraft can't properly handle fullscreen mouse input, YouTube has menu bars overlaying it, etc).","1343780589"

How to avoid shin splints - http://running.about.com/od/commonrunninginjuries/tp/How-To-Prevent-Shin-Splints.htm . Have you tried those methods? Have you googled and tried other methods? Perhaps try alternating running and a different exercise - biking, walking, hiking, swimming, etc?

The motivation can only come from you. Think about why you want to make this change and try to remind yourself of that everything you feel down. It seems like you already know a lot of motivating factors, just remember them when you feel down.

"TrueAtheism","t5_2soy6","No, the babbling is good! It's great to hear someone share something as personal as their religious beliefs, and even better to hear that they're taking a great attitude towards it. e.g. having a personal relationship with God, not letting it influence too strongly their social and political views, etc.

I think the main problem that many antitheists have with religion is that it can be, has been, and is currently being used for nefarious purposes, such as furthering political careers or causing detriment to the lives of others (homosexuals for example). If religion was more widely considered a private affair, as you seem to consider it, then these problems would dissolve away and the antitheists would merely become atheists, or even agnostics.

In case you can't tell, I am trying to compliment you in a very roundabout way.

Oh, I did have a question though. When you say ""[my doubts have] always led me to more research and I couldn't not believe that there wasn't a higher deity"", what kind of research are you talking about? Reading the Qur'an? Reading interpretations of the Qur'an? Talking to your local Imam? The kinds of sources that you are researching must play a vital role in the development of your beliefs, after all.","1343780596"

The Killing Joke

Arkham Asylum (I think this is non-cannon... but I like it)

A Death in the Family / A Lonely Place of Dying (Kind of dated art and storytelling but very important to Batman Mythos)

Hush

Dark Knight Returns

Grant Morrison's Run (Just Look it Up)

If you read through that, you'll have a very good understanding of Batman. A lot of new readers get caught up in continuity and chronology, try not to worry about it too much, though the previous is a pretty good order to read through. **Edit:**Oh and as far as Knightfall, I'm very meh on it. I thought the first arc was ok, but I found  it to be silly, the art to be bad at the worst, dated at the best, and the storytelling to be a bit weak. It's a neat premise though, and probably worth reading the first arc if you're interested.

The role of government (regardless if communist, socialist, libertarian, whatever) is to protect its citizens the best way possible, even if some citizens don't like it.  That includes judging how strongly an action and result are correlated and if any laws should be made to regulate or prevent.  It's always better to be safe than sorry.  If the regulation or law doesn't change the result or produce a better one, we can always walk it back or repeal it.  However, if we do nothing we never know if that action could have prevented deaths.  The US is at top when it comes to homicides in self described Western democracies.  Maybe we should look and see what the ones below have done to lower that.  I think gun control would be a safe assumption, including limits on magazine capacity.

So, I tell you with the deepest sympathies, because I can't imagine how  hard it must be to be so stupid, to go fuck yourself.  Mr. Big Man behind anonymity.  You talk to people like that in the real world and you'll be lucky your ass doesn't prolapse from all the foots being shoved into it.","1343780604"
"CrohnsDisease","t5_2s453","Great topic here is some background on my crohns filled life:
I was diagnosed mid first semester of my freshman year of college  and spent a total of two weeks hospitalized and missed another two weeks total on top of that. Fortunately I happened to attend a school only half an hour from my home and even though I lived on campus being close to home is the only reason I didn't have to drop mid semester (well that and completely supportive parents). I spent most of my year on predisone and now go through monthly remicade treatments. I ended up with 24 credits and a pretty decent gpa even with the missed classes freshman year. Im gonna order my comments based on what i consider the most important, so sorry for not being at all organized.

Firsts things first, your gonna wanna let your school know about your illness. A particularly bad flair is more then a justified reason to miss a class and i can almost guarantee your school and professors wont ever hold it against you. 

Next, watch out for school food. Every one of us knows our diets are important and differ greatly but if your school is anything like mine your gonna wanna watch the fried foods and poor quality meats. Almost positive school food is what really messed me up.

As far as other recreational college activities go: If Im having any serious stomach problems I simply don't drink. But when I do (fairly often) I prefer beer which sometimes becomes a pain because of all the carbonation and the quantity you have to consume. Ive found switching it up sometimes helps though but i usually avoid drinks with heavy carbonation (sodas) but seltzer is a always a good option. As far as weed goes, Im not sure if I could have functioned freshman year with out smoking in order to cure the insomnia filled daze that is predisone. But i really used it mostly for sleep... I swear


Edit: **TL;DR** Tell your school, avoid the food and party on Wayne","1343780604"

"shittyaskscience","t5_2sw51","To answer this question, we must turn to Relativity.

As you probably know, time passes slower for an object the faster that object is moving, and when the object exceeds the speed of light, time passes backwards for that object.

Ordinarily, exceeding the speed of light is impossible because the mass of an object approaches infinity as the object approaches the speed of light. However, photons are massless so this doesn't matter.

The only way to have spoilers is to know how the movie/book/story ends. To know how it ends, you must know the future. And to know the future, you must have observed the future. And to have observed the future, you must be from the future.

And to be from the future and exist in the present, you must have traveled backwards in time.

Thus, we can conclude that no, Spoilers would not cause speeds exceeding the speed of light. It is in fact the opposite, traveling faster than light causes spoilers.","1343780606"

"bookclub","t5_2qktu","At the end of the book, Bailey finds Marco's huge book--remember, Marco was trained to use writing and diagrams to make magic, versus Celia's immediate interaction with the world. 

Most of the pages of the book are taken up with pages dedicated to each person employed by the Circus. It includes their signatures (from the contrasts) and a lock of hair (or equivalent). Marco placed a copy of this book in the bonfire the night it was lit for the first time--and the bonfire serves as the anchor for his magic in the circus. 

These pages are what 'locks' the performers into the circus--as long as the bonfire is lit and the magic is keeping the circus together (as it has gotten to the point that it would fall apart without magic), everyone is 'locked in', and, like the circus itself, is made incapable of decaying or degrading. This is why it is a Big Deal when the fire goes out during the climax--the longer it's out, the more likely the circus will be destroyed, taking people with it. 

Why not Poppet and Widget? While they did eventually sign contracts (Bailey discovers their pages in the book, and rips them out so that he and Poppet may grow old together), they were born during the lighting of the bonfire, so they weren't 'part of the deal'--and thus aren't a part of the magical stasis everyone else is in. It's likely that Marco may have even deliberately not included them on the deal later on (i.e. never tossed copies of their pages into the bonfire), seeing as people would notice twin 2-month-olds never aging.

And I didn't interpret it as 'love conquers it'--but that Celia taking after her father (the magic) and her mother (suicidal tendencies, something she states overtly during the climax) is what screw it up. Love certainly didn't conquer the competition for Tsukiko and her competitor--the competitor kills herself, ending the competition. ","1343780609"

Along the same line of reasoning, if you have a cream or soap that you can make a good lather with, stick with it for the most part while rotating the blades. I've settled on feathers and know which creams/soap work for me and also know that even with a good blade, I can get a bad shave if I'm using a bad lather.

"dwarffortress","t5_2qyn1","I made a test track to be sure I can tell you every step right. To answer your question, the departure stop should be linked to the stockpile of finished goods you wish to transport to the resident area. I am not aware of a way to have them load the cart directly from the workshops.

I went to build a track layout like this:
A and B are the stops, = is the track, and s is the stone stockpile.

B==========A ssss

1. Set a track to be carved (d-T) in stone. Straight line.
2. Built two track stops at ends. Highest friction, dump west on one of them.
Be careful: both B and A are build on the track itself, not before and after it.

3. Made a stockpile near end A.
4. Created a hauling route, added two stops. A yellow ! appears at each. Let's fix that.
5. Select Stop 1 (end A). Enter to define it. Deleted all the conditions. Made ""Guide west immediately always (at most 100%)"". Enter to set stone as desired item. Added stockpile link for stop A to take items from the stone stockpile. Repeated the same for Stop 2, with condition to guide east when empty.
6. Assign vehicle.

A dwarf brought the cart and started guiding it continuously from one end to another. The condition for Stop 1 wasn't right. I selected it from the route menu and pressed c to change the condition to ""Guide west immediately when full of desired items."" Everything works as expected now.","1343780616"

Pistachios cannot be found cheaper anywhere else.  Their $2 wines are entirely passable, and fine cheeses are available in bulk.  Also, many gourmet items don't sell so well and thus end up marked down dramatically on a regular basis.

The Grand Lake farmers market is a must if you are at all serious about food.  The area is on the whole quite diverse and friendly, but there are reactionaries and occasional incidents.  Call the cops if there is a lot of shooting and/or blood.","1343780617"

No. What I said was things don't have an *intrinsic* purpose. We can give an object a purpose, but this depends on how it's used, not about how it was designed

&gt;Also, here are some examples of guns that aren't designed to kill things.

It's important to understand that the above quote is not my principle argument. The point was that I was granting you the premise **just for the sake of argument** that the purpose of an object is predicated upon its design... which is actually false.

From [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism):
&gt;Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist.[4][5][6][7] Atheism is contrasted with theism,[8][9] which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists


From our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/faq#Whatisatheism)

&gt;atheism can represent several different viewpoints, but is most commonly conceived of as a lack of belief in gods.

From the [American Atheists](http://www.atheists.org/atheism/) website:

"askphilosophy","t5_2sc5r","I think you've got value the wrong way round. Ask yourself - does real gold have inherent value? If you look at gold for a reeeeaaaally long time, will you see a label that say ""this is worth x amount per x amount"". No, you won't. If it's fake gold that convinces everyone that it's real gold, then it's worth the same amount, regardless of what you do with it, because for all the market cares, it is real gold. Suppose even the person who sold it to you forgets it's fake - then how is it not real gold? It's indistinuishable from real gold, people are willing to pay the same amount for it, you get the same pleasure out of owning it. Why does the history of the item make a differene? Answer: it doesn't. 

Think about Nikes. Nike makes some shoes. Before they stick a giant tick on them, they are worth x, because people would only be willing to pay x for generic shoes. Then they stick the giant tick on it, it's worth x+y, y being the value associated with the brand. Where does this value come from? It comes from the subjective value placed on it by people who want to buy Nikes. 

In your dirt example - different situation. You're assuming that he could go outside and pick up dirt and be just as happy, or he could do something else with the $100 and be just as happy. In the bottled water case, you're relying on being conned to impart value upon the item. If the only thing that would make him happy was to buy that particular dirt, despite the fact everyone else thought it was worthlesss, and there was nothing else in the worth he could spend $100 on that would make him as happy, even if you consider the fact he could resell whatever else he bought for more, then yes, he would be happy and would gain utility from buying it.

This tends to be another of my problems. The more I die, the more likely it becomes that I will die the next time. Short of going back to town and resetting the mission, I get those stacking debuffs to my health. The silly part (to me) is that often when I will die, the NPCs will rez me in the middle of an enemy DPS pit, over and over. This kills me again before I can do anything, and by the end of one fight I am already at 50% weakness.

im just saying i personally would be afraid of what the in game community was like if the first replies on reddit that i got were ""reddit is not your father"" and ""stop spamming""

i'm just saying this because i am a huge fan of videogames as a whole and want everyone to see what they have to offer (especially if it a game i have been playing a lot recently). and because of my passion, i always try to convince people to be respectful and nicer than normal to new players, so they have a good first impression, and will (hopefully) want to play the game more as a result.","1343780634"

"haskell","t5_2qh36","But the point still holds. I did not claim that we have a priori names for everything; I claimed that we do not go about naming things. Certainly, for lack of names, we use language to construct phrases and expressions which we intend to pick out various things in our surroundings. But those expressions are not names. They are prone to confusion; they are ambiguous; they are contextually dependent;... of course, for the same reasons, most proper names aren't ""names"" either--- that is, not in the sense that philosophers want to discuss.

Indeed, my whole point is that we stumble around to denote things as we can; but, for all the stumbling, we aren't giving names. Whereas in programing we're giving names all the time. We give names to new types, give names to new functions, give names to local variables. Even in languages with large standard libraries, we rarely have the breadth and depth of vocabulary that we do in natural language. Natural and programming languages are very different in this regard. We're stumbling to denote in both of them, but that stumbling looks very different. And in particular it looks very different with regards to naming, which is at the heart of ideas like RT.

When Frege and Russell and Carnap and Quine and everyone else was talking about RT, they were worrying about how it is that names denote. Not *what* it is that names denote, but *how*. But the fact that there are certain contexts where we can exchange one name for another, and other contexts where we cannot, throws a wrench into their attempts to understand and explain the phenomenon of denotation. That's the reason why they were concerned with RT. But if you go back and read the papers, their examples are all about the use of names. My argument is that their focus was due to the fact that their object of study was (European) natural languages, whereas in PL theory our notion of RT must necessarily diverge because of the differences between natural and programming languages with respect to names.","1343780634"

"Guitar","t5_2qi79","Try replacing your preamp tubes. Take a known good preamp tube and try substituting it for each of the existing ones in turn and see if you get a sound back.

Note: I'm not familiar with your amp, but this advice assumes that all your preamp tubes are the same kind (probably 12ax7) which is a reasonable probability in most cases. Check before you try this. Only ever substitute the same kind of tube as you took out unless you know *exactly* what you are doing.

If it's a power tube, you're gonna need to take it to a tech for rebiasing after you retube it anyway. You don't want the buyer coming back at you in a few weeks' time and telling you that the amp has stopped working again already... so do your due diligence and get the work done properly.","1343780635"

Private watchdog agencies can lose their credibility quickly if they're found to be unreliable or to constantly put out fake reports for the sake of profit.  The market would provide a reliable alternative FAR faster than government would anyways.  Not only that but they have no real power to take advantage of other than maybe misrepresenting the facts for the sake of profit which would easily be labeled as fraud.  They'd annihilate their reputation in the process and take a potentially fatal hit for fraud charges.

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","&gt;But you're not going to see that on a resume

In a surprising number I'm willing to play the odds that the person is grossly over stating competency. There are exceptions but there is limited time in a day and I will go with the best probabilistic course.

&gt;and even in an interview

I've found that candidates usually either have a proficient grasp of technical subjects that they indicate expertise with or they do not.

&gt;Sometimes, you find a candidate who is completely the wrong fit, but you know they are going to make a great employee.

I don't really understand this. In my mind ""great employee = good fit"". . We don't hire except unless we need to fill a particular slot. That slot invariably has requirements based on the need. There's simply never been an instance of interviewing someone and deciding they're so overwhelmingly talented that despite not meeting that need it's still worthwhile to bring them on.

&gt;Hell, if you say you speak Spanish on your resume and you don't actually speak it, and it's not important to the job, I might let that slide.

(1) If you claim to be an expert in Spanish and know nothing, how can I trust you and your work in the future? I work in a environment that requires me to trust you with significant responsibility. A person's integrity and honesty drive that trust and without it he or she will not succeed here.

(2) We either care or do not care about the skill. If it's necessary (e.g. require expertise in statistical methods and software) then overstating that is pointless as we're sitting you down with a stats PhD to assess competence. If it is not necessary it is extraneous information and not going to be used in a hiring decision.

Fudging is understood. What I don't understand is lying about core job requirements. It wastes the candidate's and our time.

Reasonable people can disagree. This is my particular firm and personal take on it however. ","1343780640"

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","Alduin was never really revered. Feared, yes, but the way that the ancient Nords worshiped him is...complicated. They feared him, and worshiped him because of it, basically. But the only actual ones who worshiped him were the Dragon priests, the Dragon Cult they created was practically brainwashing (many were those whose souls were taken by Akatosh, becoming the draugr we know now). Alduin has always been considered by Nords as the World-Eater, an incarnation of pure evil (see the book I linked to in my previous comment). 

I'm not quite sure where you got the concept of Alduin mantling Akatosh, they were always known among the Nords as two distinct and highly contrasting figures. 

Your concept of his defeat is totally plausible, though. They weren't very specific on the details, so there could be any manner of explanations. But the Greybeards believe that even now he isn't truly defeated, suggested by the fact that the Dovahkiin cannot absorb his soul as he does with other dragons.","1343780641"

"gaming","t5_2qh03","&gt;because homogenization of class roles SUCKS!

I blame PVP for this. EQ enabled PVP, but they specifically never balanced for it, and certain classes could trounce everyone else.


There is much to be said about balance though. EQ was great, but gameplay and solo viability for certain classes was atrocious. Warrior gameplay, for instance, was autoattack, then click taunt, bash, and kick. Warrior soloing was even worse, and you could only bandage up to 50% health. 

But it was awesome how most every class had something they were best at and were desired for, both in battle and outside of it. ","1343780644"

I was a total nightowl. I mean, I was either running or surfing or working, every night. And I'd built this kind or narrative in my head, since I was always out, and always comfortable in the dark. I wasn't just some schmuck, I was a ghost, a *ninja*.

So I see these people on the beach, and I incorporate that into my ninja narrative. I'm going to jump over them, and because I'm so stealthy silent, they're never going to notice, or they'll only notice when I touch down on the other side of them, and then they'll be awed at how badassed I am.

The girl probably had a narrative like, ""...And he was *so* romantic, and we had sex on the beach, under the moon, and I didn't get *any* sand in my vagina, and I really think it's *true love*.""

And the guy was probably just thinking, ""Sexsexsexsex"" until he heard me coming, which triggered that primal male, ""Someone's coming for mah woman! Imma kill 'em!"" narrative which lives in all our brains, somewhere...

And then it all goes south in an epic trainwreck of trashed expectations, where we all go home that night feeling like assholes.","1343780656"

As far as objectives go, know your ABCs: Always. Be. Cloaking. Send out a few ES waves to clear yourself a path, cloak, complete the objective.

FBW is pretty solid as most areas give you hallways to spot enemies and everything is roughly 30m at the farthest which means ES can easily clear out an entire pathway for you.

[Paul Grayson used to work for Cerberus, but fled to Omega and worked for Aria under an assumed name. Kai Leng found and retrieved Grayson, killing his girlfriend in the process, who happened to be Aria's daughter (although nobody knew it). Grayson is then forcibly injected with the Reaper nanobots, which control and enhance him. The Illusive Man intended to kill him after experimentation, but a raid on the Cerberus lab by the Turians prevented that from happening. To cover it all up, The Illusive Man enlisted help from Aria to get Grayson killed, withholding lots of information and leaving Aria to believe that Grayson intentionally betrayed her and killed her daughter. Grayson is eventually shot by Anderson and finished off by Leng, thus leaving Aria in the dark from what really happened.](/spoiler ""Mass Effect Books"")","1343780657"

No. Marriage as a formal, essentially permanent, pairing is not owned by religion, as much as they wish it was, and as hard as they try to claim ownership.

If tomorrow a bunch of religions you don't award belief to started claiming drinking coffee was a sacrament, would you accept that every time you drank coffee you were paying homage to some deity you never heard of?

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","Yes, that's what I thought you were arguing. And I disagree.

You say that men do want love and women do want respect but the language you are using is diminishing those two desires and elevating the female need for love and the male need for respect. You seem to believe, correct me if I'm wrong, that the need for love is higher in women and the need for respect is higher in men.

This is a really old fashioned idea and one that I've never bought. While I'm sure my husband enjoys my respect, I know for a fact that his sole preoccupation is with whether I love him and whether I show affection. And my primary preoccupation (thanks to my idiot pride) is being the kind of woman that he can admire (respect). I've dated men before who were more concerned with respect than love, but I've also been in relationships like the one I'm in now. I see no reason to believe it's a universal thing or even a majority thing. Same with women.

Ephesians as a book makes an argument for the whole complexity of relationships. Yes your verse alone would make an argument for those two things being prevelant above their counterparts, but the letter as a whole? Not so much. And even if it did, there is more than one model of how a relationship should go in the Bible. They vary wildly and account for individualistic changes.

"listentothis","t5_2qxzy","This submission has been automatically removed by the AutoModerator Bot.

Listentothis follows [strict submission guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/r/listentothis/comments/q0x6q/meta_the_listentothis_rule_review_a_restatement/) decided by the community. If you don't feel like reading this entire post, then take a look at the titles of the submissions in listentothis right now and ask yourself what you did differently.

* Titles must follow the format: *artistName* - *trackName* [genre tag(s)] *anything*
* You *must* include the artist, the name of the track or album, and at least one genre tag.
* You *must* use a delimiter such as - or 'by' between the artist and the track name.
* There are no exceptions even if this is your own music or a friend's band.
* If this music is *NEW,* *LIVE,* or *RARE* please include those tags in your title.
* Try to use [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/), [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/), [Soundcloud](http://soundcloud.com/), [Bandcamp](http://bandcamp.com/), &amp; [Grooveshark.](http://listen.grooveshark.com/)
* Do not spam your music blog. Link *directly* to media. 
* Leave your opinions and links to your blog in the comments if you like.
* Gushing about the artist or begging for attention *WILL* get you downvoted.

Delete your submission and try again. If your new title matches the rules it will be auto-approved by this bot within ten minutes. If your title does follow these rules and this was still blocked, double check that you didn't make a self-post! This happens often particularly with new submitters. You can submit a link, or submit a text post (self post), but not both. If you saw this message in your inbox, then this is the mistake you made. Pay closer attention to the submission screen.

If that wasn't the problem, then there was a problem with the genre tags you used - either there weren't any, they were too vague, they appeared somewhere other than at the *end* of your submission title, or you used tags this bot doesn't recognize yet. Read on.

---

This bot will not honor these genre tags *on their own:*

* indie alternative remix mashup cover soundtrack score singer songwriter band

If your music is 'indie' then it is actually 'indie rock', 'indie pop', 'indie folk', or 'indie electronic.' Indie by itself tells us nothing useful about the sound. Tags like indie and alternative are ignored for vagueness and won't get a submission through on their own. Meaningful tags are *essential* for scrapers syndicating our content, and for priming the reddit search engine. 

The list of valid genre tags is below. Partial matches are allowed. For example, when you see 'rock' below, it will match post-rock, rockabilly, rock'n'roll, and progrock. We aren't checking to make sure your tags are correct. We're just checking to make sure that meaningful tags are present. If you can think of any tags that are not on the list below but should be, please message the moderators of this subreddit and they will have them added to the list.

The *NEW* *LIVE* *RARE* tags are not parsed by this bot. They are for the human moderators, to help new, live, and rare music survive in spite of the rules against popular music.

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Eh, we're probably talking past each-other on semantics here. It's defined benefit based on how much you invest in, but that's true of pretty much all defined benefits programs. The main difference is that the traditional defined benefit thing makes people think of the system where you get paid based on your average salary or something like that. SS is similar, since higher salary means you pay more in (up to the SS cap) so it is coupled with salary.

Anyway... yeah, my big gripe is that when you die the money goes back into the system and gets fed into the retirement of everyone else.

The Author's gripe is that minorities, statistically, die earlier than white people and their money goes back into the system to be redistributed to the rich white dudes that are still alive.

I'm not convinced there is some big conspiracy and the system was originally intended to ship money from poor people or minorities up to rich people or white people, but I think the system has certainly turned out that way.","1343780665"

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","It's a confusing passage.

Some recent scholars think it might well be a later addition to the text.  

Whether or not that's true Romans is a letter from Paul to the Roman christian community at a time when Nero is in the midst of putting up taxes and there's hot debate about whether to pay them.  Paul (if he wrote that bit) might well be saying ""Don't make waves and bring the Emporor's wrath down on yourselves.""

Also, Paul has a reputation as a troublemaker. He keeps stirring up trouble with the authorities and getting arrested.  Part of the point of the letter to the Roman xtians is to say ""I'm coming to Rome, and here's who I am.""  This passage might well be his way of saying to a tiny minority community ""I'm not planning on making trouble for you when I get there.""

The early church was such a minority within a minority of the empire that most of the new testament is affected in some way by the authors' need to not get Rome offside.  To talk about the kingdom of heaven when Rome saw itself as the kingdom of the gods was a risky business and sometimes required some deft footwork.","1343780668"

Which is fair enough, except I dig deeper and ask why death is bad.  The reasons I come up with don't really apply to the fetus. As far as I'm concerned it's still dead. It isn't mentally born yet. It's more like a plant than a human being. I kill plants. I kill animals.

'Not perfect' is an understatement - it wouldn't work at all. You can't simply rely on others to sort it out, and help it make sense, when the very basic idea itself is flawed.

And that was not my idea, but it is one I agree with. Perhaps some legal consultants should be asked to see if they can work that out - then, and only then, they would begin to work it into a proposal.

Implying that polygamy (recognized and incentivised by government!) is a right is foolish - especially when so blissfully unaware of the clusterfuck that'd ensue.

People work around the current marriage laws, how do you think adding a potentially infinite series of marriages will affect that? Oh - you and your wife (who is from another country) are living in the US now? Okay - I guess that's - wait, she's married to another woman? Who has ten husbands, with three wives each? I guess they'd all better come over!

What Skyrim, and to an even greater extent Oblivion, lacked is setting.  Morrowind is just so much more interesting than the typical fantasy settings that the next two games were.  Morrowind truly felt like a foreign land, whereas the next two games felt like a generic high fantasy setting, complete with boring enemies like wolves and bears and goblins.

"Music","t5_2qh1u","To everyone who keep repeating: ""Louis CK did this""

First of all, Louis CK is a *well known* comedian. If he did this model at the *beginning* of his career, I don't think it would of have panned out so well.

Second, He is a comedian, not a musician. There is a lot more than writing witty lines for lyrics. There are producers, engineers, publishers, distributors, etc. Everyone needs to get paid. 

And when (indi) artists have to release free music, how are they getting paid let alone paying everyone else for their time and services? Even if you pay $5 how is that going to help them pay their bills? 

Not everyone is Rihanna, Justin Beiber, Madonna, U2, etc...

There are a lot of indi musicians out there who are starving not only for a dollar but to get heard by a wider audience but don't have the capital and start up.

Going to a label lis like going to a real shitty bank to get a bad deal on a loan that an artist could definitely use to invest, but at the cost of creative, and artistic oppression (making music the label thinks will sell, not music from the heart), and rights. The artist basically looses all creative and artistic control going to a label because you have to use their money to make a sound that *they* want to sell.","1343780676"

On an individual level it's possible to hate whites and be racist against them but without systemic oppression against whites, jokes at their (our?) expense just don't carry the same weight. You might not like to hear it but shucks, it's true.

And that is totally and completely irrelevant to the conversation. We're talking about racism. Period. Not ""institutionalized racism."" The ones that typically bring up the sociological definition of racism are SRSers trying to justify their shitty behavior. They use it as an attempt to *derail* the thread. Because you can't talk about racism without talking about the injustices minorities face right? Because it's *always* about minorities.

No. What I said was, SRS is a racist and sexist shithole. Despite ""who is on top."" There is no systematic oppression on reddit, or anywhere else on the internet. So get over yourself.

&gt;I never apologized for it. I said it was tactless, but understandable given the context. Never once did I say RobotAnna's comment was okay.

No it wasn't. Democritus made an empirical prediction- if you kept cutting an object with increasingly fine knives, you would eventually reach an indivisible piece. He lamented the lack of sufficiently fine knives and steady hands and keen eyes to test this.","1343780685"

We were each others first - which I am very glad for because we have really grown comfortable with each other. I didn't necessarily enjoy sex at first, although I did enjoy being physically and emotionally close with him. After a couple of months, we really became a bit more comfortable and adventurous with each other. You can always introduce new positions and places (outside is fun!). The internet is great for these types of things! But we have only had ""plain sex"" (except for an accidental anal the other day. Don't try that - it's painful!) I would just make sure that you both feel open and comfortable discussing what turns you on and turns you off. He has mentioned anal to me before, which for me is a total turn off. Make sure that your relationship is one in which both partners feel like they can say yes and no. And then nothing can be boring!","1343780686"

However, I had another take on it (and I don't know whether or not this was what OP was referring to but this was my interpretation). Say that, rather than in this scenario where you had control over and had to control each process, say it was more like autopilot vs. manual (like we might look at our breathing). What if all our lower bodily and even lower brain functions were NORMALLY delegated to their regular systems, however, if we so chose, we could ""switch to manual"" and directly affect them through our own control, even our own thoughts?

In my city, the police tend to focus mostly on underage people at the bars unless they get a call. Fake IDs seem to be unusually common around here.

In the dorms at my school, there's a three-strikes rule in effect for people living in the dorms at my school: the third violation in a single year, and you're kicked out of the dorms and still charged for that semester of rent. If you do idiotic stuff while drunk, you can get kicked out even sooner.

For people with university scholarships, those are usually revoked if there's a second violation before the first is closed and penalties served, or if there's a third violation within a single year.

And why the hell would they leave out minutes, seconds, months, lunar months, fiscal quarters and so on?

If you are talking progressively larger units of time, the progression is hours/day, days/week, weeks/year.

And what is this BS about Saturday and Sunday? So is there an equivalent common saying ""24 hours a day, 5 days a week, 261 days a year, unless the days fall such it is only 260 and not 261""?

How many businesses are open 24 hours a day but closed on Saturday *and* Sunday? I cannot think of one.

I'm no chemist, but gasoline is chains of carbon and hydrogen.  The carbon pulls lots of hydrogen close to it (like two or sometimes even three atoms of hydrogen per atom of carbon) so that you end up with more hydrogen packed in than if you just had hydrogen atoms floating around on their own.





Each molecule in gasoline might have like 20 or 30 hydrogen atoms.  Each molecule in liquid hydrogen has exactly 2 hydrogen atoms.  That might help explain why, but I suspect a full and detailed answer requires a proper chemist.","1343780697"

I also gladly pay the $10 a month to subscribe to Spotify and Grooveshark before that all the way back to Emusic before they started limiting the subscription by a certain amount of songs per month. 

I feel that most music lovers would gladly pay for a decent service that gives them unlimited access to lots of music even if the price was higher than Spotify now. The key for people like me is that it has to be diverse and have access to lots of music as I am a junky and go through all sorts of music each month. 

People who aren't really into music are not going to ever give a shit enough to pay it back. These are the people that would only listen to the radio and maybe buy a cd or two each year in the pre-piracy days anyway. ","1343780699"

I don't understand - my wife doesn't either.  We'd rather have the cash.  But whatever.

However, I did spend about $5,000 (don't worry, I can afford it) on an engagement ring (and this was from my good friend, a diamond merchant who could sculpt any ring, at cost), so, if it was retail - it would be $10,000 - $15,000.  My fiancee, who is the least materialistic person in the world (she admires my 200,000 mile Corolla), loves to show it off.  It's her prized possession.  Even she's surprised how much she loves it.  It was worth every penny IMO.

In other words, don't underestimate girls showing off their engagement ring.

"australia","t5_2qh8e","It's a little tongue in cheek, but it's typical of what happens in government.

So much effort is spent justifying, recording and verifying expenditure, to try and stop the very abuses that appear on ACA, while simultaneously people whinge about how long it takes to get anything done.

Catch-22.

I note that the full list is printed:

&gt;They were: customer service officer, asset management manager, acting personal assistant asset management, transport co-ordinator, community land planner, community planning manager, finance and administration officer, community liaison officer, personal assistant to managers, community and recreation development co-ordinator, communications co-ordinator, personal assistant general manager, public relations officer, community development director

A lot of those seem like ""FYI"" positions that *every* job request has to go past.

For instance, the transport co-ordinator has to be aware of any requests, in case the work would have an impact on traffic conditions. (ie do they need to set up a detour because half the road's being torn up?) 

Now people's first reaction is, ""oh this is just a sign, surely it won't have that big an impact."" Which is true in this instance. But the transport co-ordinator is the one who has to make that call, because not all requests are that simple. What if the sign needed a new road island built to accommodate it? The transport co-ordinator has to see these jobs, even if they just forward them onto the next person with a ""no action required"" stamp.

The community liaison officer has to be aware of what's going on in the area (to liaise with the community properly) so they've got to be in on the deal. Otherwise, we get rate payers jumping up and down because work's occurring and they haven't been told. 

I can see it now: ""why do we pay for a community liaison officer, if they can't tell me what the hell's going on in the area on a given day?""","1343780711"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","&gt;&gt;However, the basic statements that I stated are not all held facts. And if I take away the ""life starts at conception"" part, then ""abortion is murder"" can no longer hold, and more importantly: given that there is only one living individual in the abortion procedure (again, assuming life doesn't start at conception), then it is a matter of personal health, and is therefore healthcare.

This logic is flawed.  You're saying that life beginning at contraception is not a fact, which I accept.  However, where life begins is not a fact at any stage, be it 1 month in the womb, or 40 years out of the womb...not a fact.  Therefore with your very logic, your mother could kill you at 40 years old.  

But wait!  The best is that there is no factual information of when life begins, correct? (This is not rhetorical)


So, you're saying that if we can not determine it to be a life using facts, it has no rights?  (Also not rhetorical)


Therefore, since you demand a scientific fact for when life begins in order to give something human rights, we have not been able to determine the mother as a life.  Therefore, she also has no rights.

As you can see, your argument also lacks consistency as you demand ""held facts"" which are unattainable, yet on your side of the argument you replace those necessary ""held facts"" with an assumption.  Actually, the very same assumption your competition is trying to make.","1343780712"

If that's not an option, your best bet is to offload data to another HDD (a friend's perhaps) until your HDD is at or below the capacity for your new SSD, then use a defrag program to push the data to the front of the disk, shrink the partition, and clone it to the SSD.

Though, he couldn't fly with JUST electricity, he had to use an item to actually fly, much like Aang with the glider.

I would also recommend getting an e-reader (kindle or something).  At first I was kinda against it because, hey books are awesome, but once I got it, its pretty much the best thing ever lol.

Seeing as your diction already seems quite strident, I'll take your words with a grain of salt; I rarely fault the ignorant for their sophomoric, haughty attitude. Should you not know the difference between respect, whatever the tone, and prostration, then you should spend a bit more time delving into the realms of logic. I went into the topic with a sympathetic attitude, leaving a true and honest comment to the effect that *not all of these people are the extremists who are gay-bashing, warmongering, anti-islam extremists* - a common caricature of the modern Christian. I wished to appeal to them, yes, but not in a subservient way. That being said, I was on /r/christianity, so did not want to come off confrontational; appealing to the friendliness, hinting at the opportunity for evangelism, merely offering an open door for enlightenment, for education, is a much more diplomatic and productive approach to *absolutely anything*, be it something as controversial as Christianity or as mundane as the policies of Starbucks' creation of the monstrosity of an iced upside-down caramel macchiato. 

Now, understanding that tactfulness is not your strong suit, and that you obviously were overtly offended by my post (that's why you're being a dick, right?), I forgive you your defense-by-offense tactics in this short conversation, and hope that you find a bit of peace in yourself - if not for your own wellbeing, then so that you might show a bit of ***fucking respect*** to another human being, regardless of your self-entitled (and completely unwarranted) superiority complex. 

Also: big ideas don't need to come from big words. My vocabulary is used at my leisure to most concisely express whatever it is that I wish. The fact that you found my use of a three syllable word an attempt to upstage or intimidate you tells me that you are not used to people using words of such complexity. I apologize for scaring you. 

P.S. Fuck off. 

[edit] Also, I was not attempting to spur debate, as I clearly had said, I just wanted to see a bit of conversation between like minds on a topic that is affecting a large community filled with people who are focused on making the world a better place, regardless of how misguided I may consider their focus to be.

"Economics","t5_2qh1s","This isn't the case, many benefits, for instance unemployment insurance, etc are mandated.  The value of benefits (for instance 401K matching contributions) are directly correlated with wages and many health care plans are only for those well up on the wage scale and thus indirectly related to wages.  Further, the benefits of subsidized by the Government and thus society at large in a non-rational way.   The only real ""benefit"" of employment is health insurance and that is both rationed and of limited utility- it's wasted when it's not utilized and insufficient when it's needed (chronically you are old or suffer a catastrophic illness or acccident/bill)

Compensation is a variable cost, most benefits are very inelastic so really wages are what are fixed by the competitive market and in most cases the first to suffer and the last to recover in an overly competitive, commoditized marketplace (the reality of the situation for most of us)","1343780726"

"pugs","t5_2rl4o","I will second, third and fourth the comments already listed here.  I will also add a few of my own.  I have had pugs for almost ten years now and they are the most adorable, funny, clown dogs.


I have adopted both of my full-breed pugs from rescues. They are WONDERFUL dogs. You can go to the petfinder.com website and search for pugs in your area. Rescues generally charge around $300. Petfinder provides a link for all reputable shelters, rescues, etc.

I LOVE my two pugs and wouldn't trade them for the world, but I hope you understand that pugs are VERY expensive dogs to keep. They require a LOT of care. Most likely they will need eye surgery or they will go blind. That costs a minimum of $1500. They also get respiratory infections a LOT and each vet visit is about a hundred dollars. 

Also, pugs shed a LOT. . . . ALL THE TIME. . . . . If you want a dog that won't leave hair EVERYWHERE, don't get a pug.

Also, pugs are VERY people oriented dogs. You can NOT leave them at home alone because they will become very lonely and destroy things. Lastly, please remember they are NOT outdoor dogs at ALL. In the summertime, they have to be kept in the air conditioning because they are VERY prone to heat stroke and can die VERY easily.

Pugs are WONDERFUL with children. When our first pug puppy was only about 7 months old, we had 12 Cub Scouts at our house. These 9 year olds just kept playing with her, but being young, they were pretty rough. She was just WONDERFUL with them. Never laid her ears back, just had a good time.

Lastly, be VERY careful about where you get your pug.  Do NOT go to a pet store to do it; most likely those dogs are from puppy mills.  Petland is especially guilty of this.  I bought my first pug from a pet store (not knowing about puppy mills) and she died last year of liver failure due to so much inbreeding.  I truly recommend getting pugs from rescue.  All of my other dogs have come from rescues and, although they have had issues, I love all of them and the look of gratitude they have.  They KNOW you saved them from where they were before and they love you for it.  Good luck and welcome to pug world.  Oh, by the way, pugs are like potato chips - you can't have just one.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Good question! X-men happens to be one of my favorite comics... particularly because of the idea that gene 'x' causes such a wide variety of features.

Unfortunately, a single gene could not be responsible for so many things at once. Example? Angel or Warren Worthington III, who has giant wings that give him the ability to fly. 

The development of functional wings is a complex process, involving small mutations in hundreds of genes. You need the bones to be told to grow, the muscle for those bones' movement, the nerves so you can control them, and the feathers to cover them. 

A single gene could not give someone wings, but a host of many different genes might. (If you can get around the problem of birds having feathers and being reptile-cousins instead of mammal-cousins.)

However, many genes contain alternative forms that can help or hurt you. 

Take for example a gene for a protein in muscle. The gene ACTN3, which codes for a particular kind of actin. Actin is a part of the muscle that is involved in force generation. It's what the muscle grabs onto when it activates. 

Some people have mutations in this gene which cause this form of actin to not form. Surprisingly, this mutation has been linked with long-distance runners, because it forces all their muscle that would have used this protein, to use an alternative protein and behave differently.

However, the exact same mutation is also linked to an increase in inflammatory myopathies, or group of diseases that involve chronic muscle inflammation, accompanied by muscle weakness.

So the question of what makes a mutation hurt or harm you can be a subjective one. Being able to run long distances is good, its almost like a super-power, but having lifelong muscle inflammation would hurt a lot.

Genes mutate randomly, and fairly frequently. The copying process isn't perfect and sometime an error is made. Children often sport at least one mutation that wasn't found in either parent -- these mutations are often in the non-coding part of the genome and thus have little chance of being harmful.","1343780730"

If the catholic church built a golden building on the back of donations I will still say it doesn't sit with their claims to be great defenders of the poor, because it simply doesn't - It's okay to not prioritize the poor, but when you're saying you do while spending money on a golden building in a country with some of the worst poverty in the world I will not believe you.

"Parkour","t5_2qk85","As Yokimme has already said, you're jumping too far up in your first jump (or set). This is leading to a lot less height in your frontflip. Try taking a long, low jump as a set-up, and make sure you're feet are in front of you by the end of it. This helps to ""block"" your momentum and send you upwards instead of forwards.

Also, when you're about to throw your flip, you have your head down and are throwing your arms down to flip... This will throw your flip towards the ground, rather than up in the air.

After your long, low jump, punch off the ground with two feet, but throw your hands **UP** and follow with your head. Then, instead of bringing your chest to your knees, pull your knees in and **bring your hips UP AND OVER your head.** Hold your tuck until you can spot your landing, and kick your feet out to the ground.

**TLDR** - long, low jump. Punch off ground. Head and hands **UP**. Hips **UP AND OVER**. Spot landing and land.","1343780736"

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","There are two types of crustal material, continental crust (which makes up the continents) and oceanic crust (which makes up the crust at the ocean floor).  Oceanic crust is denser than continental crust, so it's generally always oceanic crust that subducts when colliding with other crustal material.  Continental crust is lighter and tends to float - so when continental crust collides with continental crust, they both stay on the surface and combine into a larger coninent (such as the formation of Pangea).  Due to the large momentums, the continents will tend to ""scrunch up"" at the collision site to form a mountain chain.  

So, in short, it's unlikely that much continental crust has subducted due to its tendancy to float above the mantle.  ","1343780738"

"stopdrinking","t5_2s7yr","I have struggled with this a lot. One thing, and maybe this is a totally typical evasion, is that it bothers me how ill0defined an vague ""alcoholic"" is. Who knows what this or that person thinks it means? So, when of I tell someone I am an alcoholic, I have, in a sense, no idea how they take it. They may know a lot of people who drink like I drank, but they don't consider THEM alcoholics, and they think it means something totally far gone, naked arrests at the wheel of you car and all that. 

I only found the strength to stop drinking by a  massive cop-out on the question of, am I really an alcoholic? I decided it didn't matter what I called myself, what was needed was a change in my behavior, and that seemed undeniable. I had run the typical course of trying to control my drinking, and no dice. The longer I go on, the more I feel compelled to say, yeah, of course I am an alcoholic. People who aren't alcoholics do not, simply do not do the things I have done, for starters, including quitting drinking totally as an alternative to escalating to some hellish endgame stage of abusive drinking. So, trying to be objective.....the conclusion is becoming clear. let's say.

But to me, the most important part of my little rambling story is, I found that I could actually make progress by just not worrying about the label too much, and actually stopping drinking. I don't really understand what happened, I guess you'd call it a moment of clarity. Just do it.....if you know it's what you need to do for yourself, and you'll have plenty of new free time to think about what it all means :)

EDIT: apologies, I was mistakenly thinking you were still just thinking about stopping, since I didn't look at your badge. OK, bed time soon.","1343780744"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","Actually the meaning of informed consent is fairly obfuscated on its own. It is not always clear what counts as consent, and I think it is counterproductive to claim it is a simple issue.

For instance, is it consent if the word ""yes"" is never actually spoken but every form of physical consent is present? This has happened to me before.

Or, can you (or to what point can you) consent while inebriated? If the consumption of any alcohol negates the possibility of consent from either party, then I have both raped and been raped many times.

Consent is complicated.","1343780744"

This random civilian would have to prove that the ""air"" around his land was not only cleaner before the plant, but would have to come up with an exact price as to how much the damages are, and the litigation, etc.

This is unavoidable no matter what solution we have for pollution.  The alternative is a government bureaucracy that is likely to be even less efficient.  Also, typically pollution happens in a wide area, so it would usually be a class action lawsuit which would have the resources to hire a good lawyer and consult an air/soil quality expert.

&gt; I'm sorry dude, but you REALLY need to get out of the libertarian fantasy land.

Nearly every thinking man in the early days of our country believed in limited government.  That is why in the constitution in article 1 section 8 there is an exhaustive list of the powers given to the federal government.

I have to say that it worked pretty well for a while.  Most of the problems we have now are due to unconstitutional power grabs that have occurred over the years to the extent that now the president has the authority to assassinate citizens on a whim!  Rights like free speech have little meaning if I can be assassinated by the president for saying the wrong thing.

I would say it is you who needs to get out of fantasy land.  Historically it is seen that big powerful governments always take away your freedom in the long run as the checks and balances and limitations on power erode and the political class gain more and more power to do as they please.","1343780753"

I wish I had gone to the disabilities office on my campus and requested consideration or assistance or whatever for my classes. I really just needed professors of early morning classes to cut me some attendance slack since my fatigue was unbelievable, but I was really nervous that I would get shot down if I tried to ask, and I also didn't want to think of myself as someone who needed help. My own psychological issues aside, if you haven't already (and I'm sure many younger Crohnies reading this have) you need to start standing up for yourself, instead of a parent fighting for you. My mom always did everything for me with Crohn's stuff and when I went away to college, I had to learn that no one cared that I was tired or my stomach hurt or I was stressed or I had to go to the bathroom all the time. I had some really unforgiving teachers, but had I gone through the disabilities office, I'm sure they would've given me the consideration I needed.

I can't really comment on much of the other stuff, nor do I want to be long winded.

**TL;DR** Go to the disabilities office, tell your teachers, be upfront, demand the consideration and help that having Crohn's entitles you to.","1343780756"

"AdviceAnimals","t5_2s7tt","The being rich thing isn't the problem. The problem is that he seems not to understand what it means to be a normal American. If you see an interview with Bill Gates, you get the impression that he, while the richest man in the world, has an idea of what normal people do. Romney does not. 

Obama is rich by any definition. But he's still relatable because he acts like a normal person. Romney, on the other hand, has been so far removed from anything close to normal for so long that I doubt he really understand what life is like for a normal American. 

It was like when George H.W. Bush went to a grocery store during his campaign and was amazed at the UPC scanner in the checkout aisle. Knowing about grocery technology has absolutely nothing to do with how good of a president someone will be. But if a person hasn't been to a grocery store in so long that they think cashiers are still typing in prices by hand, then that person probably has no idea what's going on in the real world. 

So the problem isn't necessarily that Romney has friends who own NASCAR teams; the problem is that he's so far removed from everyday life that he seems to think that's normal, and that he should say that sort of thing to a crowd of lower-middle-class NASCAR fans. ","1343780758"

"personalfinance","t5_2qstm","Thanks for those two options. I didn't know they existed (Prosper and LendingClub.) Unfortunately, I went through a messy divorce about 5 years ago and it wrecked my credit. They don't accept people like me. I only need $500 bucks, and it's short term. I live off grants and student loans, and they will be distributed in less than a month. But there are always hang-ups when it comes to financial aid distribution; so it could take up to two months. 

I just recently moved out of a house I couldn't afford to a place where I am paying half the rent I was before, but it's a new landlord who doesn't know me, so I can't begin our lease agreement with special concessions, you know?

The only hope I have is that my student loan cash will distribute in the next 30 days, or I will be screwed. Sometimes I feel like people like me get swept under the rug, considered a financial outcast because I went through a divorce. Before my divorce--and being laid off because of my divorce--I had perfect credit, and I made very good money. But banks have deemed me unreliable, so I have been treading water for the last 4 years without credit cards, health or dental or vision insurance, waiting tables for a living. 

I wouldn't trade it for anything, because my education has been integral for who I have become, and what I will do for the rest of my life, but I have been living on less than $10,000 a year for 4 years.

If one takes as an example the American citizen Obama murdered in Yemen, that person never picked up a weapon and never built a bomb; he was a propagandist. And it can be argued that his son that was later murdered did not even do that. In WWII -- when the US faced real enemies with real militaries -- we did not murder Tokyo Rose or Axis Sally.

You'll find that most American gun owners take a VERY dim view of CCWs who act like the police.  The point of a concealed firearm is to protect yourself and those you care about from grievous harm when there are no other options.  If you are in the situation where your only option is to be at the mercy of a criminal, a firearm gives you an alternative option.  That's it.

If you don't believe me, head down to /r/guns or /r/CCW and ask around.  Virtually anyone there will tell you a CCW permit is not a license to go looking for trouble, nor should it be used as one. ","1343780768"

"funny","t5_2qh33","Well you are right; I suppose I do use the term ""every"" loosely but what I meant was size in general not bust size because some very tiny girls can have huge bust sizes (seen it plenty of times) and they do leave the store unhappy. I know that when they measure you and they give you a general size, they sometimes don't tell you that you're actually 3 different sizes. For example, I'm a 34 B but I'm also a 36 A and a 32 C. So sometimes for women you have a bigger bust, they'll recommend a 38 and just say to use the last clip to make it fit. Yeah they do want the customer to be happy, but it's also a business so they want customers happy to spend their money.

And also, smaller band sizes and bigger cup sizes are not AS common as the 32-36 bands and A-D cup sizes so they don't manufacture them much because they won't bring in as much profit (at least that's what they told me because I did ask why they didn't carry AA sizes or anything bigger than D) but I think that that's crap to be honest.","1343780768"

"Tribes","t5_2rdsl","&gt; You think devs should implement a FOV setting on the horizontal axis but at the same time limit the vertical axis only?

I think ideally both could be set independently, but if one has to be locked it should be vertical I think. But yeah, thats more or less it.

&gt; Also, a lot of games get triple monitor setups right. Especially ones these days

Yea, it's getting better, but thats mostly thanks to AMD Eyefinity/nVidia surround, not the game engines them selves. AMD/nVidia often hack around with things at the driver elvel to get it working properly. Like I said earlier, in UE3 games most of the time you can't even get the FOV to stick, you have to bind the command to 'w' or some other common button so it gets re-issued every time you try and move forward or whatever or else it will get buggered up the first time you sprint or go into scope.

&gt; The exceptions are usually console ports that limit aspect ratios to either the standard ones or just 16:9 (looking at you bulletstorm and mirrors edge).

Oh god, Bulletstorm :S Even their shaders were aspect practically locked to 16:9. If you ran at a resolution that didn't properly divide by 8 then performance tanked massively. The competency level of devs (or lack of caring) really does astound me sometimes.","1343780772"

"gallifrey","t5_2tf29","Very well thought out and presented!  This is definitely one of the reasons that I love Classic Who and its EU much more than the new.  There was so much attention to continuity and detail, and adding the level of intertextuality that I feel is lacking in the new series.   Whether or not this is attributed to a different type of audience, a different format in the programming (one hour full stories, as opposed to the classic multi-parters), or something else, I can't tell.  

I really want to find and enjoy this depth in the new series, but feel that the references and depth in story, lore, and legend are lacking...sometimes merely thrown out there as a bone to us old timers.  Because of this it really does feel like the new series is a complete reboot to me, rather than a continuation of the classic.  You do inspire me to dive back into my novelizations, PDAs, EDAs, NAs, and MAs though.  I have almost all of them and they're feeling neglected!

For example [this](http://torrentfreak.com/bittorrent-piracy-boosts-music-sales-study-finds-120517/), [this](http://torrentfreak.com/pirates-are-the-music-industrys-most-valuable-customers-100122/), [this](http://www.gamerevolution.com/news/swiss-government-finds-piracy-leads-to-sales-9847) have shown it to be otherwise.

&gt;A new academic paper by a researcher from the North Carolina State University has examined the link between BitTorrent downloads and music album sales. Contrary to what’s often claimed by the major record labels, the paper concludes that there is absolutely no evidence that unauthorized downloads negatively impact sales. Instead, the research finds that more piracy directly leads to more album sales.    

---

&gt;Compared to music buyers, music sharers (pirates) are…  
* 31% more likely to buy single tracks online.  
* 33% more likely to buy music albums online.  
* 100% more likely to pay for music subscription services.  
* 60% more likely to pay for music on mobile phone.  

Here's an interesting [example](http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101021/10481211524/comic-book-pirated-on-4chan-author-joins-discussion-watches-sales-soar.shtml).

"Parenting","t5_2qhn3","You don't have to ""give in"" to a tantrum... but it never hurts to give empathy.  I have one kid who has had horrible tantrums from the start and we really suffered for quite some time until we figured out things that helped.  One of my kids' preschool teachers offered us the video by Harvey Karp based on his book ""Happiest Toddler on the Block.""  While we never did do his full-on ""toddler-ese"" technique... he is definitely on the right track with his empathy approach.  When I offer my kids my empathy &amp; stay close so they know they have some arms to crawl into for comfort, they are much more likely to calm down.  

Kids who tantrum easily are not spoiled, but they are slower in developing some of their emotional controls.  When they face a problem in life, they flip out rather than thinking through the problem.  They need coaching to slow down their reaction and learn to problem-solve.  They need calm voices, measured/reassuring reactions from adults &amp; understanding.

Punishments only escalate the situation (including time-outs).  We have had much better success with viewing/treating tantrums as a developmental issue rather than a behavioral issue.  Positive reinforcement for well-handled situations is much more powerful than any punishment.

Best of luck - for some kids, tantrums are SO BAD.  It's tough, but it's not about you... it's about them.  Keep positive &amp; although they can last for some years, they won't last forever.","1343780783"

If you don't have proper sender set, you would likely never see the return emails because of a double-bounce condition.

There are many possible problems, perhaps your MTA stopped automatically appending domains to recipients, or started rejecting email from non-FQDN senders. You may have DNS issues trying to validate the endpoint domain. You may be able to fix this as easily as copying over your /etc/aliases file from a working server and running newaliases.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","AD mid was very popular once, I see no reason why would it be so bad now. Caitlyn, for instance gives incredibly tough time to all the squishy APs who stacked MRES and were hoping to win, she basically shreds those 15 armor they have by simply armpen, she basically deals true damage while outranging all autoattacks and some/most skills. She gives incredibly hard time to every mid who is forced to take all the cs by autoattack early on as early on she can stand in the middle of the lane and hit every time enemy approaches, he ends up recalling, dying, or having no exp/cs. Usual problem is bursty champions with mobility like Gragas or Ahri, they kinda jump on you despite your traps and escape and able to burst you down very quickly while your damage is constant but doesn't have any burst to it. It's all about the matchup in my opinion. I successfully countered Morgana as MF with Wits end, didn't care about black sheld at all, used health reduction to prevent spellsteal and was running cleanse to avoid cc. I really think that there are matchups where you could send AD mid and AP bot with support, especially with soraka who gives endless mana.","1343780794"

I do not mean to sound patronizing, but you need to save a lot more. The strategy you've got is not bad as long as you continue to grow your $1,000 (by saving more and more). Let's do some mathematics. Say you can have a return of 10%pa from a mutual fund (ridiculously high, right?) that amounts to $100pa off a $1,000 investment. $100/52weeks is $2/wk (rounded up). Does an extra $2/wk mean that much to you? Now take your $2/wk, cut out a coffee/wk and push bike to work once a week instead of drive, or whatever and you got yourself and extra $8 or so. Coupled with the $2 you end up with $520 extra in your bank account at the end of the year. Then you can invest more, and your $2/wk has just gone up. But, don't ever forget, you could increase your salary by investing in yourself (eg. course, accreditation, etc)","1343780798"

I've already turned it down multiple times as well and I got no pressure from those friends to smoke it.  I know it's best to stay away from the people you did it with, but they're my best friends and I completely trust them to never pressure me, as well as quit when they need to (school coming up).

After having typed it all out I feel that this is more risky than I first thought.  However I've already turned down the next high, so I'm just planning on stopping after this.  I didn't feel any addiction symptoms after the last few times, so I'm feeling pretty confident this is the last time.  I'll be sticking to trees.

and the Lavarnway stuff is probably just me annoyed at the FO's ineptitude. if he can't catch, then stop wasting his time working on catching and just let him hit (he'd have more value as a good-hitting DH than a catcher who can't catch, whose offensive #s are hurt by him catching). and if he can catch, then they're going to have to give him a chance at some point (and the last two months of a lost season seems like a great time). he's turning 25 in a week. he shouldn't be in the minors next year.

He made a soft whirring noise each time his blue sensors scanned an individual. Cel found the noise comforting.

She enjoyed the sights of Illium. It was like a glossed over version of the Citadel; just as much crime, but with a sparkle. It was the kind of place she could settle into. Yet, her Quarian roots pulled her away from settling anywhere. She had grown up a nomad, and now she lived as an exile. Having an actual, grounded ""home"" seemed like a foreign concept to her.

You're a guest in their house after all, and even if you've been friends for years, relationships can still wear thin.

Second tip: Don't be above doing anything that comes your way for money, and don't be afraid to ask for money when you do something(within reason). If someone says 'hey, can I get you to help me move this wood?' do it. Ask them afterwords if they would kindly give you compensation and explain your situation. People are generally good, and need that chance to show it.

Third tip: Always have a backup plan. Find out whose house you'll be staying at next because one wrong argument and you get kicked out and you will be in a tough bind.

How do women view your non-circumcised penis? Is it really that much of a hygiene problem? What about the sex?

I'm circumcised.  If I had the choice, I wouldn't have gotten circumcised.  If I could magically undo the circumcision, I probably would (not that weird foreskin restoration shit).  Truth be told, I actually have a less-sensitive dick.  It takes me longer than it should to get off (and has since as long as I can remember).  I hear about guys taking only a minute or two and I'm shocked...because it takes me like 30-40 minutes of constant stimulation minimum...and that leaves lots of time to go soft (which is ridiculously embarrassing if you haven't experience it...and can lead to some serious anxiety problems when it comes to sex).  I don't know if the lack of sensitivity is because of circumcision...or because I masturbated A LOT as a kid (I discovered it when I was really young...like 6/7)...seriously, a few times I did it so much that I actually bled.","1343780811"

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","That doesn't seem to respond either to my points. My point was that mathematics is real and therefore any metaphysics need to account for that (and implicitly that naturalism didn't). Your reply was that since particular religions disagree that means there is no religion or it is at least improbable. I responded that you can make the same case for morality and that some do and that instead you should regard the for arguments for morality against the con arguments and come to a conclusion. I stated it is much the same for theism. You must confront the bare case without the tradition and go from there. 

Now we are here:

&gt;Gravity has a pretty good physical foundation. We don't know down to the particle reason, but science is comfortable calling it a law.

We have a repetition about science working. So far so good:

&gt;Take something like love. Love is qualitative and isn't physically tangible save the actions we refer to as love.

Ladies and gentlemen we have a dualist! If irreducible qualitative things like love exist we can work with that. Is love real or is it only physics? Clarify that for me please.

&gt;Now take god. There is a 'defined' intangible and his 'creation' could easily be explained a totally different way. So what makes god real besides man's mental gymnastics. Mental gymnastics have created items that are not real in the least - unicorns, trolls, bigfoot, etc.

&gt;Provided all of these common, real, phenomena how is god different?

God is not a physical object but a qualitative experience and metaphysical postulate. You seem to regard metaphysics (or perhaps all philosophy?) as ""man's mental gymnastics"". Do you think that Metaphysics is crank philosophy and that we can never reason from our physical and qualitative experience to any truths whatsoever? If so then you know if God is true if the argument works out.    ","1343780815"

And drink water and eat fiber so your poops aren't horrible. Then you can start adjusting what you want, like if you work out you can go for more protein.

There are Mediterranean diets, keto diets (there is a keto subreddit), all red meat diets, vegan diets, vegetarian diets, gluten-free diets etc and you are allowed to look up every single diet known to man and see which one fits your body and your money better. And know what the pitfalls are, like anorexia nervosa, bulimia, diets that force you to eat NOTHING, diets that force you to eat artificial sweeteners, stuff that you're allergic to.

For most things in life, you *don't need people in authority to guide you*, because there is absolutely nobody who knows everything and biases affect every single person on this planet so nobody can be 100% reliable anyway.  You just need a support circle of friends or even people who aren't your friends, or random people on the Internet to discuss healthy anything with and draw ideas from, be it sex advice, food, or budgeting. 

We have to take advantage of sources of information and piece things together, but many people do not.

I know lots of women are absolutely terrified of being found out that they know NOTHING ABOUT THEIR COMPUTER, so they try to hide it by learning a couple of buzzwords... but it's really as simple as looking stuff up and learning. I think it might be related to people's pride or ""wah, only weak people need help"" but that's so backwards. The mentality of ""This flaw is what I should be proud of:/

If I want to do more difficult stuff like start fiddling around with the stock market, be a dedicated day trader, or publish a book, there are still things I can look up related to all this.

"politics","t5_2cneq","Since its been four hours I'll give it an answer. I disagree with most of what I hear from libertarians but whenever I give a general criticism I always get pretty much the same reply: Not all libertarians are X and I believe Y, or such-and-such wasn't/isn't a true Libertarian or they back off every point until their claims are things that non-libertarians could agree with *anyway*, like an end to drug prohibition. Their disagreement usually comes in the form of wanting to re-define things that other libertarians previously defined for me and they end up only responding to that and not any actual implications of it.

So I think the best critiques of broad groups are typically found in the form of questions. This is especially true of dogmatic belief systems (like most religions) where a disagreement of premises usually shuts down a lot of discussion, so questions to probe and explore the beliefs become the best form of communication. It seems to me that most disagreements that people have with libertarians are disagreements of premises that never get resolved, so I find questions a good form for critique. If I wanted to disagree explain disagreement I would therefore ask several questions and to get an idea of their beliefs while challenging them. Here are some examples:

1. What are your criteria for a truly libertarian society? I hear many things from many people and the terms (non-aggression, no taxes, etc) are usually ill-defined, inconsistent between each libertarian I talk to, or not defined at all.

2. What are some truly libertarian societies in primitive human history? What happened to them?

3. What is the most advanced civilization to ever come about that was a truly libertarian society, meeting every libertarian qualification (non-aggression, no taxes, etc)? Is it still around? If not, what happened to it?

4. What truly libertarian societies with modern civilizations still exist today? If you provide an index of most-economically-free countries, please list only the countries that meet all of your criteria for being truly libertarian.

5. Spontaneous order is mentioned on the sidebar here. Counting all of history, what is the greatest accomplishment that a civilization without any taxes has achieved? I am not asking for an accomplishment without the use of taxes, but rather the greatest accomplishment that happened within a civilization that had no taxes.

6. Do you think that the existence of property rights has made some portion of the population in some civilizations worse off than they would be in civilizations without property rights? In other words, do you think there is a segment of the population of any property-rights-holding civilization that is worse off than the population of nomadic tribes? I am not talking about people who are worse off in and of themselves, such as those with birth defects or unfortunate accidents, etc.

7. Do you think the existence of property rights could possibly lead to some segment of the population being less free?

8. Suppose there exists an island of 100,000 (say, Rhodes) with several springs and two freshwater aquifers, and one aquifer is suddenly spoiled (poisoned or depleted), while the other rests solely on the property of one individual who refuses to sell any of the water, what is the outcome in a truly libertarian society?

9. If 8 ends in an outcome where all of the islanders die except the freshwater owner, who does their property belong to then?","1343780816"

To be honest, the original is better imo, both musically and vocally. It's got a real raw energy to it, and a nice touch mixing in the choral church music to the punk part. But the cover is a nice gesture, and singing the lyrics in English might reach a larger audience.","1343780817"

Also remember that *ageism* like *sexism* and *racism* are also in jokes within the community and that it's pretty difficult to differentiate between what's a joke and what's honest stupidity.

The **Con** and **Lib** reddits, both slightly larger at 9 and 8 thousand respectively, weren't as enthused, with Cons giving it a 3-7 rating, and libs 7-3.

It got decent traction in the **Politics** (1.7 million subscribers) reddit with a 101-32 or +69 rating and 45 total comments. r/Politics is a pretty lib place, of course. Comments in the other reddits: Rep/7, Dems/13, Cons/2, Libs/4. I assume this makes sense, people in Rep and Dem are going to be interested in the practicality and minutiae of the numbers, people in Lib and Con more in theory.

The Lay walker is up to level 4 (I never liked the last skill) and now the big question is how far can the first radiant wizard spell get me. I'm already on level two but I feel that the disadvantages of levelling the wizard now are too severe for a low level character and to use that second spell you really have to be surrounded by few enemies, just for one is a waste. At the same time even one bastard can fuck you up pretty bad... So now I'm in a dilemma between levelling astrology and alchemy. I have absolutely no problems between the conflux, the siphoning and drinking booze.  
My problem is mostly doing more damage (3 or 4 hits for killing a Zomby is too much, I think) and surviving any kind of hits.

Also fucking traps. I don't know how I manage to hit so many. I must be more careful.

That would be the best possible scenario, if we get Belt going it's game over.  On the other hand I've always had the philosophy that you should stack all your best hitters at the top of the lineup to maximize their ABs.  Nobody seems to be putting pence 2nd is this not a viable spot for him? I don't know much about him. God I wish we had Freddy Sanchez, the ultimate #2 hitter. I'd like to see Arias in at short more often I like his defensive game better than crawford's and when it comes to batting it is a toss-up. They should also experiment with scutaro/theriot up the middle. The problem as I see it is that we have a defense-first fist basemen, which is the last spot you want someone for a glove rather than a bat. What if we just signed Bonds and stuck him at first? He's looking healthy from cycling and if you think he can't still hit a big league fastball you are crazy. This comment has gone off the rails and I apologize. ","1343780828"

I want to know how you feel about the direction Wurm has gone without your presence?

Many people who now play that game seem to resent your's and Minecraft's success as they somehow consider you a ""traitor"" to Rolf and the community that has built up around your previous project, do you have any thoughts on this?

It should be noted that I personally do not feel that way, I've always found your work to be quite good as a fellow programmer I was also impressed by your submissions to the challenges and contests you've entered previously (like http://www.mojang.com/notch/j4k/l4kd/) and I bought in on Minecraft when it was first announced that you were moving on from Wurm to start the project.

I doubt there is any possible way you could regret having left Wurm and moving on to your own projects as your success has obviously been a thing of legend, but I wonder if you ever have any regrets or questions as to how Wurm turned out in terms of your vision for it.

Anyways, I'm sure this will be buried under the thousands of Minecraft related questions, but I figured I'd ask in any case just on the chance you do see it.","1343780831"

Like I wrote earlier - you can change your -own- values with for example Firebug, but if you'd like to steal money you need to be able to change -other- peoples form values (and also expose your own merchant secret to calculate your new md5key clientside before submitting the form to your DIBS merchant page), You can technically do if the user installs a malicious extension in their browser.

The bug on Auth.net was probably made possible by either not requiring an md5key (or similar test value) or if there was a bug in the form validation  - while bugs do exist the presence of md5key can in theory always secure form values from being manipulated.

There are alternative ways of integrating payments with your site that only go through your merchant server (end-user never communicates with merchant), but this is usually more difficult and requires you to have a valid SSL cert for your site (that many Small-medium businesses do not have or need).

There are so many people out there who want to get into bass fishing, and redditors in paticular need to get off the internet and go outside.  There are plenty of redditors like me who have been fishing our whole lives and I'm here to offer my tips, advice, help for anyone who needs it.

I have already unsubscribed from /r/fishing because it is nothing but pictures of regular fish (you may have 1 or 2 tropheys) but it turned into a /r/gonewild for fish. 

Now dont get me wrong, I like to see people posting a 10lbs bass, but it seems everyone wants to post a picture of every regular fish they catch for karma.

The difference between the americans and non-americans in master's level theoretical probability and statistics is shocking.  The Americans all make the mistakes the article calls pattern matching.  When asked to differentiate f defined by f(y) = x^y they give the answer y x^(y - 1). These are senior undergraduate economics, actuarial science, and financial math majors also graduate students in a variety of programs.  These are the people taking the ""hard"" senior/master's level course.  We also have a dumbed down course covering more or less the same stuff, but these programs don't accept it for their majors.  The foreign students have no trouble operating at what the essay calls the algorithmic level (which is all we ask).  I won't say it is impossible for Americans to do a PhD in a technical subject.  My two most recent PhD students were Americans, and they were good. But most PhD students in our program are foreign.  And many of the Americans we admit get discouraged and stop with a master's.

"DebateReligion","t5_2snuc","You don't seem to think there is any difference between the terms 'gender' and 'sex'. The medical and scientific community disagrees. Your definition of the term gender is not correct according to the most popular usage, and it does not match the definitions used by science and medicine.

Transgenderism is not a life choice. It is a medically recognized affliction wherein the sex of the patient does not match their gender.    The Americal Psychological Association has determined that gender is unlikely to change, that the best treatment for this problem (gender dysphoria) is to surgically alter the patient's body to make their physical (albiet not genetic) sex the same as their innate gender.

Reading your arguements with 'icecreamwiththeenemy', I assume that you are either unaware of, or choose to dismiss the scientific concensus. If it is the former, I can offer links and reading materials so you can discover more about what is known about this subject. If it is the latter, I'll offer such links as my evidence supporting my arguement, and will wait and see what you have that can overthrow the last 50 years of psychology.","1343780851"

Torrents are an amazing way to find music you'd otherwise never be exposed to), I wouldn't have to procure my music in other means.

  I support the bands I like, by telling people about them, listening to them, and going to their shows, but music companies don't care about the music, or spreading music around, they just want money for nothing and as much of it as they can get, and flood the air with whatever they force to be trendy. 

  I call this ""manufactured music"", no talent involved, just makeup, stupidity, and some shitty ass beat.  Yet bands like Black Joe Lewis, Viza (Visa?) (currently touring with Serj Tankian), Murderdolls, Municiple Waste  or GWAR, don't get get any shelf space at all.

"SRSWomen","t5_2tdoc","If you were one of my patients (dental hygienist here) and you were to confide in me and explain your anxieties, I would do whatever I could to make you feel comfortable with your treatment. Any other hygienist that I know would do the same. 

If you feel that it would help, ask your hygienist or dentist to use the tell-show-do method throughout your appointment. It's a tactic that we commonly use with kids at their first dental visit, or with special needs patients. It may make you feel more at ease if you know exactly what is going to happen.  For example, I would tell you I was going to dry off your tooth with my air-water syringe. Next, I would show you how I was going to do it, what noise it would make, etc. After you were comfortable with that (and only then) I would actually dry off your tooth.

Bring your friend. As long as they are not disruptive, there is no reason they should not be allowed to go back with you. 

When I first started working, I had a new patient that would only come back to my room if her sister could go with her. They are both in their late thirties. Eventually, her sister started ""taking breaks"" by leaving the room during appointments, then she started staying in the waiting area. This morning, my patient came to her appointment alone. She admitted she was a little nervous, but she was a great patient today. It will take baby steps.

I try not to lecture my patients, unless I have exhausted all other options of encouragement. Simply tell your hygienist or dentist that you know you need to take steps to improve your oral health and you need to know what those steps are. That should change the course of the conversation from a lecture about brushing and flossing, to educating you on exactly how to care for yourself and your teeth.

I hope this is helpful.  If you don't feel that the office is accommodating your anxieties, take your business elsewhere. There are a few hardened dentists out there that don't take anxiety issues seriously. You deserve someone that makes you feel comfortable. Most importantly, you deserve to take care of yourself!","1343780855"

so my friend goes back there,and shit you not, hes got a ""9 in Big Boy"" chillin on the seat, and he had ""lost"" his clothes. now, what makes this story better, he came in with a PAIR OF JEANS AND A T-SHIRT AND BOOTS. told him to leave. leaves store. doesnt leave premisses. friend calls me on how to handle situation. he goes to edge of parking lot, tells dude he cant stay the night.
so he leaves.
well, he comes back the next day during my shift. this time in boots and a trench coat, i see him walk in the front door, know his face from the security tapes. switch the cams to look at the parking lot out back, HE PARKED IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT. well at this point, im like, i gotta fuck with this dude. He looks a merch for a few minutes then comes up to me and asks for a 5 dollar video card, and wants to preview a movie. so im like cool, what you got under the jacket??? (its mid summer at this point).

""oh nothin but the usual""....*awkward silence, no action from either side of the counter*

dude, are you gonna be doin more shows like last night???

""no...i...i dont evenknow what you're talking about.""

so if im to call the police and tell them you're back again, they wont find you giant red dildo shoved up your ass? or your van parked in exactly the same spot as it was last night when you got kicked out???

""n...no?...""

i dont remember much more of the convo after this point, dude ended up getting banned, later found a post on craigslist that dude was ""in town on business and wanted to do a show""

Because, you could have a great life like her. The only thing I was trying to state before it has been blown out of proportion is that yes, she had a great outcome, however that does not mean that legal decisions should be made on one possible positive outcome of something. 

So, thank you for putting words in my mouth, you do not speak for me. I believe that there should not be laws that restrict a person's decision to have an abortion if they so chose to do so. ","1343780861"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","The narrative does change, but very slowly over time. To say that the narrative never changes is like saying evolution isn't true because we can't see it happen before our eyes. You have to remember that back in the 50s and 60s, Republicans AND Democrats were often socially conservative, and differed on economic and policy positions. Now, Republicans are considered conservative on both policy and social positions, while Democrats are considered liberal on both policy and social positions. These things change over time, and people gradually take on new positions. 

In terms of honest discourse, you will never find that in the political sphere. There's a book called ""Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America"" by Morris P. Fiorina that argues that most people are moderate on nearly all issues. These people are often on the fence in terms of issues, so it takes powerful (and often very strong and stubborn) positions in order to sway them, which is why you always see the same discourse in politics. Part of this is also fueled by the media (holding onto strong positions riles the people up, makes them excited to watch the news).","1343780871"

That was a pretty while stab in the dark, and missed by a good margin. I'm just confused on how only unpopular stances are ""states rights"" issues.

Every tea partier I know has called himself a libertarian. Suddenly they're not libertarians because its not convenient? 

The financial collapse wasn't caused by government intervention. That's a zombie fact. If it was caused by the government, what law went into effect in 2000 that started the housing bubble? Or in 2006, or 2008? The housing bubble was created by perverse market incentives where CEOs effectively chose their own salaries, and tied them to short term stock value and included golden parachutes, so they have incentive to gamble.

Great Britain's economy has moved basically lock step with ours since at least the Great Depression. They put in place harsh austerity, while we took a weaker stance (but still fired a lot of public employees). Our economy is weak because the public sector is shedding employees, and they're in a double dip recession for taking the same bad idea to a greater extreme.","1343780874"

I, on the other hand, view my car as an object just like my cell phone or a paperback book. It is something I bought because it gives ME pleasure and it has a practical purpose. I don't really care what it's going to be worth when I sell it, really, since I paid for it BECAUSE it would give me pleasure, not because it would hold it's value more or less well than other cars.

But then again, if you do it this way and you really have ADHD you're not really solving the problem. To truly live well with ADHD, you have to change your perspective on your responsibilities. The meds make you more efficient, but they don't fix time management or general irresponsibility (not to imply that you are irresponsible.) In fact, I had a friend who got medication this way, and since he hadn't learned to control his focus, he still missed assignments and projects and failed , in spite of having amphetamines in him.

"buildapc","t5_2rnve","Jumping on this - is overclocking really even worth the effort for real-world applications (even gaming)?  It is often taken into consideration on hardware reviews, and as I was maturing through learning about computers I jumped on the whole ""let's chase overclocks!"" craze without putting much thought into it, but as I have matured and started putting thought into it - it seems much less appealing to do.

A lot of consumer motherboards aimed at the PC enthusiast group typically include auto-overclocking features, but which in enthusiast-circles are often down-talked for ""Not providing a big enough gain"" - but getting that ""big enough gain"" by manually overclocking is a lot more effort, sometimes risks components, possibly reduces the components life-time, and often requires even more hardware to be feasible (after-market coolers).

Most hardware reviews that take overclocking into consideration often have per-game graphics with stats such as overclocking will take a user from 40FPS to 45FPS in Battlefield 3, and spouting what a great gain that is - but for the end-user, I'm doubtful such a gain is even noticable, let alone noteworthy.

With the current state of technology, I'm thinking overclocking is really just over-hyped in enthusiast/gaming circles, and seems to serve primarily as a metric to compare systems / ""skill"" with other PC enthusiasts.

So, what do you guys think about overclocking?  Is it worth it, and does it really have any real-world benefits?","1343780880"

I don't really care what the original claim was. Whether the journalist violated the ToS or not is - as you mentioned - arguable (I personally don't think he did because the information he posted was publicly available). People like you argue that the journalist violated the ToS. Other people argue that he didn't and that Twitter was the one who violated it by suspending his account. It won't matter because it won't likely reach court  to determine who breached what.

My only problem was your claim that:

&gt; Twitter is a private company, it can do whatever it wants regarding it's own free service. It's not a constitutional right to have a fucking twitter account.

My point was once a ToS has been entered, then Twitter can't just do whatever it wants; they have to conform to the terms of the ToS.  Although there is no ""constitutional right"" to have a twitter account, there is a contractual right under the ToS.

&gt;  If this journalist wants to sue, we'll see how far he gets with that.

Likewise, the ""suing"" argument doesn't hold water. First of all, the journalist already said that he doesn't want to sue. He would just wind up losing a lot of his time and money pursuing the case. Secondly, if he does sue, he most likely won't ""go far with it"". But this is not because of your claims that Twitter can do whatever it wants, but because of the disadvantaged position of the journalist in the courts.","1343780882"

"HPMOR","t5_2t5xf","Here's my official hypothesis on the mechanism that makes magic work:

In the history of both our world and Harry's, whenever we've found some bizarre new family of physical processes we couldn't explain, it's turned out to ultimately boil down to the dynamics of pointlike particles constituting a field of probability distributions. There's no apparent reason to think magic breaks this trend, and we can use this as a working assumption to start devising tests as to the nature of magic. If there is a family of new elemental particles implicated in spellcasting, we could assign them the placeholder name 'magon.' At its crudest, magic could work by the Source of Magic emitting magons in all direction, using the bounces like echolocation to detect very specific genetic, neurological, and behavioral phenomena, and responding (per its programming) by firing more magons in a concentrated burst (like a depth charge) to manipulate the distribution of matter and energy in a specific location. Magons then have at least two classes of function, perhaps corresponding to different kinds of field:

1. **Spell Detection**. Humans aren't complex enough to have magic coded into their own makeup, so spells must depend on transmitting information to some computer-like Source of Magic. Magons provide a medium for conveying this information, since sound waves, brain waves, etc. don't seem to travel far enough on their own to be useful to any localized artifact.

2. **Spell Response**. Once the right 'code' is detected, the SoM must output a specific effect.

How does the SoM receive and transmit information rapidly enough for us to not notice a 'lag'? Well, we could test whether there is a lag by trying the same spells on different parts of the Earth; if the SoM is in any specific location, and magons have a stable finite speed, it should be possible to detect roughly where the SoM is by observing minuscule lag between the same spells in different locations.

What if we don't observe such a lag? I'd venture that one plausible reason the SoM can do so much is that it's capable of faster-than-light communication, that it can move energy around arbitrarily quickly. This in fact is its only ability, and magons mediate this ability. This hypothesis has the following advantages, for starters:

- It explains time travel. Going faster than light is the same as moving backward in time, so magons (which might very well be tachyons) could be a plausible mechanism behind Time Turners and prophecy.

- It explains instant teleportation (by floo, phoenix, apperation, etc.). Magons disassemble a person and then either reassemble him elsewhere or simply create an exact copy elsewhere.

- It explains how transfiguration could be consistent with conservation of energy. Transfiguration is simply making one entity disappear (apperation-style) and making another appear in its place. It's absurd to claim there's a real transformation occurring, since the energy released in a lot of transfigurations would suffice to destroy the planet Earth. Far simpler is the suggestion that transfiguration is just 'swap' teleportation.

(We would then need to explain why we can't do one half of the swap to annihilate a thing, or to summon a thing without annihilating anything. The latter question, at least, is easily answered: You can't transport something into a place that's already occupied, even by air molecules. Transfiguration is basically a way of temporarily creating or teleporting a thing to you, which requires clearing a space, a 'landing pad.' The utility of using a concrete object for the bounds of this space is that it makes it easier to indicate to the SoM the dimensions of the object you desire.)

I further hypothesize that magons at low energy levels are almost completely non-interacting (hence their not showing up in physics experiments as yet), and that at high energy levels they interact primarily or entirely with photons. Manipulating electromagnetism with sufficient exactness could explain most spell effects we know of, and also explains why high-magic areas like Hogwarts disrupt muggle electronics, both in canon and in HPMoR.","1343780883"

Granted I've never heard the government tell a person they need to be circumcised as a punishment for a crime. I'm also glad that the government doesn't tell people whether they can or can't circumcise their children. There are many reasons for parents to have their kids cut. :-/ Most seem quite flawed but that I believe is still up to the parents.

Its important to keep in mind that when sentencing a person convicted of child abuse, the aim is to 'rehabilitate' the person. Not simply to punish them. Again, castration as part of a sentence goes against the very grain of our constitution. It falls under ""cruel and unusual punishment.""

Let me give you comparisons regarding other crimes:

* **Money Laundering**: Never be allowed to have money ever again.
* **Drug Dealing**: Never be allowed to have/use prescription medication again.
* **Destruction of Property**: Never be allowed to own property.
* **Forgery**: Never be allowed an identity.
* **Assaulting Police**: Never be protected by the police.

&gt;Nobody is independent if you throw enough money at them.

Yea but if they misjudge a product because of a bribe they wouldnt be very trustworthy anymore and therefore no one would request their services. The market would keep them honest.

&gt;Also if a real independent tester disapproved of my product, I'd just setup my own “independent” lab to approve it for me.

Yea but whose word, as a consumer, would you take? The independent unbiased tester? Or the firm who says ""trust me we tested it and its safe"" and then doesn't have it tested by another party.

&gt;Most importantly, if the free-market could have done this all by itself, it raises the question: Why didn't it? Empirical evidence is the best kind, and if the free market was doing such a good job, people wouldn't have needed the government to create an FDA in the first place.

Because government, no matter what always wants to attain more and more power. Just because the market could do something better doesn't mean the government will let it. For example the market does mailing way better than the government. Fedex and UPS are profitable companies as opposed to the US postal service which is officially broke. There are many other examples as well.","1343780889"

"hydro","t5_2rbou","Yeah, whenever it comes to peppers, I always look to a method that lets the grower control the amount of water the plants get. Most hydroponic methods are built around continuous water exposure, except for ebb and flow, pot culture, and a drip system. The ebb and flow and drip systems will need to be maintained differently for peppers from any other plants on the same system, like tomatoes or cucumbers, which is why I advise pot culture for peppers. Unless one gets an entire ebb and flow or drip system that is dedicated to and setup just for peppers, I think pot culture gives you the most flexibility to grow a few pepper plants. Of course, it would not be difficult for OP to build a drip system for three pepper plants, but pot culture is just so easy, and the results are still great.","1343780890"

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Here's my thoughts on this as a teacher who had worked for in a couple of low-income schools. 

1. To qualify for reduced lunch, a family of 4 will have and annual income of about 42K or less. For free lunch, about 30K or less. So in other words, not ALL people who qualify for lunch programs are desperately poor. There's a big range there. 

2. On the topic of homeless status, school children can qualify as homeless if the family is living at another person's residence. In south Texas, the oil field workers who are part of the fracking will pay a premium price to rent a house. Some families are doubling up in one house, then renting their house for $1000 a month. Even though they chose to put themselves in this position, they can and do apply for homeless status for the benefits. Also, kids who live in ""temporary"" housing such as a motel. And yes, some parents motel hop because they can't get a lease anywhere. In other words, not all these ""homeless"" kids are sleeping on the streets. 

Fun fact: A district I worked for, had some policy that any food given during the day had to be consumed then or thrown away. Some kids would eat half of their breakfast, the put the box of cereal in their bag for an after school snack. We were told NOT to let them do this. We just looked the other way. ;)

Another fun fact: the school lunched are DISGUSTING! Nothing but refined sugars and fat. Our prisoners eat better than our children. 

TLDR: not all kids getting free/reduced lunch are living in poverty. Not all homeless kids are living on the streets. ","1343780903"

Jordan: **$5,900**

Egypt: **$6,540**

It's crazy if you're an asian dude who likes white girls. In Japan, a lot of women don't like Japanese men. The women there hate the traditional roles. But they LOVE American men. Any kind.

I found that going vegan was a much easier way of life than trying to count points or anything, and since I like eating la large quantity of food, I could eat lots of good for me stuff without feeling terrible.  So as a full fledged meat/dairy lover here are my suggestions.

* 1. Don't tell anyone you're going vegan. (seriously)
* 2. Donate/give away dairy/meat/etc.
* 3. Stay away from faux meats, cheeses, etc for the first month(s).
* 4. Go to your local hippy food store (bulk room) and get the basic dry goods (beans, rice, oatmeal, ww flour, spices/seasonings).
* 5.  Salad - not just iceburg, but kale, spinach, cilantro, mesculin.  Stay away from processed dressings.  Learn to love balsamic vinegar.
* 6.  For cravings of 'normal' food, make pizza, sans cheese.  Buy regular tomato sauce and add italian seasoning from the hippy food store.  Make your crust with the above ww flour, yeast, h20.  For toppings, lots of mushrooms, spinach, sauce, and other veggies.
* 7.  Don't freak out if you make a mistake, but just keep on going.  
* 8.  Get a pressure cooker.  Being able to make dry beans in less than 30 minutes is a lifesaver.

I lost my job, went back to eating like shit, and then felt like shit.  Back on it now.  It was a tough transition going vegan (for my family), but I never judged them if they wanted hamburgers.  Slowly, as they started to feel better (physically &amp; not feeling 'overfull'), they enjoyed many of the things I made.  

Here are some fun resources:

* 1.  Vegan Zombie (but uses faux meats/cheeses)
* 2.  Engine2Diet (netflix, or their website)
* 3.  Fat Free Vegan on fb or via their site
* 4.  /r/vegan

Good luck!

P.S.  Be prepared for a better time in the bedroom, both sleeping wise and a... well you know.

"askscience","t5_2qm4e","Hi again!

So my stick is now one light second long.  I'm holding one end (A) in my end, the other end (B) is, of course, one light second away.  The stick accelerates at two light-seconds-per-second-per-second along the vector AB. 

Using newtonian physics, after one second, A will be one light second away from me, and B will be two light seconds away from me, and the distance between A and B will remain one light second.

  If we consider special relativity, how far away are A and B after one second (of my time).  I don't mean how far away will they look if I used my eyes,  I mean how far away would I calculate them to be.  Due to length contraction,  the distance between A and B is less than one light second, so A must have travelled further than B.  I think I'm trying to understand the difference between A's path and B's path...","1343780914"

Again, wrong. The military will never be called in to deal with civil issues. There's something very disturbing about using the military to fight their own people. Even when the riots happened we didn't call in the military despite huge unrest and basically no police that could do anything. 

Using the military would be political suicide. ","1343780914"

"PoliticalDiscussion","t5_2sfmf","""What is so difficult about privilege is that it is a concept that is counter-intuitive to the privileged. Privilege is, by definition, the advantages people have that they don't think about. Understanding it requires an active effort to see things from the perspective of other people. Accordingly, extremely rationalist or scientific arguments, or, perhaps more to the point, the people who make them a lot are often jaw-droppingly bad at figuring out this concept. This can lead to problems both small-scale (chronic inability to get women to talk to you) and large (chronic imbalance in performance in math and science between the sexes and long-term entrenched sexism in the entire scientific field).

Remember - if you have the luxury of only thinking about privilege sometimes, odds are good that you have a fair amount of it. ""

"DnD","t5_2r9ei","**Creation**

1) Keep in mind that the CR for monsters listed in the monster manual is balanced against players using the elite array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) or 23 point buy, so going with something like 4d6, drop lowest reroll 1s, or bigger will make balancing encounters MUCH more difficult for the DM.

2) As for starting items, you can't really start with anything in the way of magical items, by default, as players start with under 100 gold at level 1. If you are starting above that... i wouldn't recommend it for a first time player. As for level 1 gear, I recommend getting a backpack, sack, sleeping bag, rations and torches, chalk, and anything else your character can afford that could be useful. Oh, and never leave home without a towel ;)

**Druids**

1) Animal Companions are like a second PC for your druid player. They are constant, mundane animals and can be killed, KOd, etc. The core rule book should explain what happens if they are killed.

2) Summon Nature's Ally spell summons another animal, just like summon monster for the wizard. These are in addition to anything you currently have, including your animal companion and any other animals that might have already summoned (since at higher levels they last more than 1 round). At level 5, you could in theory have 1d4+1, +1d3, +1 creatures out from the SNA1 creature list.

3) Animal Companion could be either way, since they have their own dex/initiative, though I have always played with them going at the same initiative as the druid. The summons go immediately when summoned, which is almost always on the druid's turn.


Regarding other tips, in no particular order: 

* get a hold of some monster manuals. MM2 and 3 are invaluable for animal shapes once you get wildshape

* look into the magic item compendium for wild clasps so that you can keep your gear in animal form. 

* Get Natural Spell ASAP. 

* WIS &gt; CON &gt; CHA = INT &gt; DEX &gt; STR

* Multiclassing looks fun, but is a significant drop in power for ALL casters unless trying to go for a very specific trick, since you lose out on caster progression, wildshaping power, wildshaping times/day and animal companion growth

* Get light barding for your animal companion, look in the equipment section for unusual shapes. It will make the companion harder to hit and survive much better. 

* Druids can have amazing destructive power in their spells, but they are even better at crowd control and disrupting enemies with their AOE debuffs. Intelligent use of those spells will make things MUCH easier for your 
party. Buffing your animal companion is generally less useful than it might seem, except for animal growth.

* The Riding dog is the best core animal companion, if trained for war as explained in the monster manual. Or if you have access to the Monster Manual 3, look into getting an AC that is not trained for war and getting the Warbeast template applied (it is applied through training, not inherited and your AC is still a normal animal so it can be applied.) Your DM might not be OK with this, even though it is within the rules. Remember Rule 0: the DM has final say, no matter what.

* Be creative. As a druid, you have the WIDEST range of abilities of any class in the game. Through wildshape you can be a melee almost as effective as a fighter. As a caster you can blast almost as well as a wizard/sorcerer. You have unparalleled crowd control abilities. High level spells can destroy towns with one casting. With natural spell you can do all this at the same time. 

* Try not to break the campaign too much.

To reinforce something if it isn't clear: Summoner School games should be taken seriously. If you have been invited to a normal draft game, treat it as such. Only try new/whacky/risky builds if your team is okay with it. Feeding and screwing around in normals ruins the game for everyone.

Any chance you can expand upon the limitations to F2P Warzone limitations? One thing I've always stated is that if I could pay 15$ to play level 50 Huttball whenever I wanted, I would gladly do it. I'm just curious if paying players will be able to specifically blacklist Warzones they despise, or even better queue for only what they choose. 

Because the first 5 times I played it, Voidstar forever became ingrained in my vocabulary as ""Derpstar"" and while the fence addition helped... I still despise it. 

SO: Any chance PVP'ers will get WZ specific queues included in the 15$ they're paying? Or any details you can share regarding the F2P PVP limitations?

 Changing the channel does not make someone more responsible. You can say, some parents will change the channel for 1 reason or another, but being responsible is not one of them. I did not have to explain the reference, because as an adult I can out think an 8 yr old and change his attention for the 5 secs needed to have him forget what the reference was in the first place. I am also an adult (and I was watching it with my sister (adult), brother in law (adult) and not a single adult thought what you did, so no. I will not trust you that adults will think that. 

You would be wrong if you think I would argue that it does not happen all the time. I would argue that it does not happen enough. I find more vague jokes in a Shrek Movie then in a 2 hour Raw. 

If targeting Family is ""better for business"" then targeting a more mature audience, then please explain why sales keep going down? WWE was far more valuable and made far more money when it was targeting a more mature Audience. In fact, once they began to scale back on the raunch and be more ""family oriented"" it seems they began to lose audience and stock value. They had FAR more success when they were more adult themed then they are having now. I would even argue that the videos that sell best are ones deeply embedded in that raunchy past. Steve Austin sold more shirts then Cena does now right?

Simply by looking at stock value, Attendance numbers, Ratings one could argue that targeting families is a bad business model. I want some facts to see where you got this silly notion that for Wrestling, Targeting family actually does make you more money.

I am a 5th year political science student pursuing my BA, and I almost dropped out because I thought it was a waste of time (hence why I had to take a 5th year because I dropped classes in my third). Anyway.. The point of my reply is that the degree will help you no matter what. All job applications in government, management, PR, teaching, etc. etc. etc.  look at the level of your credentials not the field.

If you have a masters degree then you are THAT much more competitive in the job market, whether it be for a job in architecture or not. Your peers are correct when they say that it does not matter what field you are in, it is the fact that you have completed the education that matters. What would you say to potential employers if you dropped out?

""INTERVIEWER: On your resume here it says you attended Blank University for two years but did not obtain your masters degree. Why?

You: Oh yes I decided I would drop out because architecture was not for me. However, I did gain valuable experience while in the program but I thought two years was enough for me. 

Interviewer: So you just have your BA then?

You: Yes ma'am/sir.

Interviewer: Well good day to you.""

With just a BA you are in a much larger pool of people who are also competing for those jobs. You could always exclude that you even pursued the MA in the first place from your resume, but then you really will have wasted those two years.

Stick it out for one more year, walk across the stage and get your degree. One year is a very short time that will be over before you know it. Take it month by month and know in the back of your mind that you will be DONE with that degree FOR-EVER after this final push. You can be finished and never look back. Make your graduation something to look forward to.. A sense of accomplishment for overcoming the impossible and something you absolutely despise. 

Honestly, it is better to push through one shitty year now (when you are younger and can handle a little bit of stress) than to be completely bummed out later in life that you cannot go back and complete the program. Although you are thinking about the NOW, it will be so beneficial for your future and you will have NO regrets. 

Mildly depressed now? Embrace your depression and sit and eat ice cream for weeks at the thought of attending school for another year. That is MUCH better than having a mid-life crisis at 45 because you didn't push yourself harder as a young adult.

You can do it, believe in yourself. Also I am new to Reddit but if there is a way to PM me on here, if you feel like scratching you eyeballs out one day, then definitely feel free to do so.

I bring this up every single time this is brought up on Reddit. The whole reason this is such a big issue is that the banks lobbied for their actions *to become legal* in the 90s. There are, in fact, a few things that people have done that ARE illegal, but I would urge you to look into the fact that Preet Bharara (U.S. attorney for Southern District of New York), who's an awesome guy (worked in his office for awhile this year) has brought close to 70 charges against Wall Street members for insider trading. He's one most of them, too. 

While that's not the same as the credit default swaps and BS loan bundlings, those things were never illegal. At least he's going after them where they actually broke the law. And yes, there are a few cases of people legitimately breaking the law that have come out recently, but these things take at least a year, if not more, to investigate and compile information on.

It forces the behind team even further behind by sacrificing items and gold when items and gold are the things that can get them back into the game.

I'm not sure how I feel about the strategy, but it's certainly an interesting angle I hadn't thought of. Lothars/shadow blade always seems super ""meh"" (with the exception of kunkka), and just about never buy it. ","1343780947"

"ancientrome","t5_2s8l1","Oh, I absolutely believe that Augustus was complicit in Cicero's proscription. However, I believe that the Triumvirate had a series of debates over several days regarding who should and should not be proscribed. Augustus, I'd read, actually argued in Cicero's favor, but was eventually convinced that he was too dangerous. 
  
You are correct, however, in that my source was friendly towards Cicero. It's from Plutarch: ""The proscription of Cicero, however, caused most strife in their debates, Antony consenting to no terms unless Cicero should be the first man to be put to death, Lepidus siding with Antony, and Caesar holding out against them both. 4 They held secret meetings by themselves near the city of Bononia for three days, coming together in a place at some distance from the camps and surrounded by a river. 5 It is said that for the first two days Caesar kept up his struggle to save Cicero, but yielded on the third and gave him up. The terms of their mutual concessions were as follows. Caesar was to abandon Cicero, Lepidus his brother Paulus, and Antony Lucius Caesar, who was his uncle on the mother's side. 6 So far did anger and fury lead them to renounce their human sentiments, or rather, they showed that no wild beast is more savage than man when his passion is supplemented by power.""

There is no way to confirm or refute the truth of that passage, as it was written in the late first century, but if we accept that your quote is authentic then I don't think it's unreasonable to believe that it went down somewhat like Plutarch described it.

"Christianity","t5_2qh6c","&gt;So do you believe it is a sin or not now?

I explained this in my last post, but let me try another way. 

An action can be called ""sinful"" in the same way that an action can be called ""hateful"" but the issue is not the action, but rather the quality which it possesses. So when I say a hateful action is wrong, I'm not objecting to the action as wrong, I'm objecting to hate as wrong. 

So a traditional interpretation of the bible marks all homosexual action as having the quality of sin. Sin being, not an action, but the motivation. 

Is this more clear?

&gt;Which is what I've been discussing the entire time and you choose to change context. I framed my question to coincide with the conversation that at least I'm attempting to have. Think about what I just quoted in context with ""I said, that the a traditional interpretation of the Bible says that homosexual action is a sinful."" So in one case you say sin can be an action, but in another you say this isn't how you can describe sin?

As I said, I was not saying that sin was an action. I was saying an action can be sinful, as in ""possessing the quality of sin"". 

&gt;So you don't no believe that rape is inherently immoral/sinful/wrong?

The term rape carries with it motivational implications. When we say someone ""murdered"" someone, we understand that as being qualitatively different due to the motivation. The implied motivations of rape are bad. Can you think of rape where the motivations are good? The point being here, that motivation is the problem. 

&gt;I don't attend church, so no it isn't defined this way in ""my"" church. That's a simplified definition. Biblical sin (notice the action involved):
&gt;http://bible.cc/1_john/3-4.htm
&gt;Pick your translation. It's described as an act, and and action of disobedience. Would you like more examples?

What law is it talking about? It says it's breaking a law, so please explain what that law is?

&gt;I never said it was primarily an issue of action. I'm discussing an action though, and your view on sin is reflected through action. I've also never disagreed with your view on sin, but you refuse to take your view further than it's most basic aspect.

Okay so we don't disagree... hmmm... I'm not sure if we're still having a misunderstanding or not. My view is that sin is not action, but can be reflected in action, that no action is inherently sin, but that motivation is the source of what is sinful. Do you agree on this?

&gt;This is irrelevant. Everything that is considered wrong for rational reasons is because of their negative consequences. Feel free to give me an example of this not being true.

I mean, I don't agree with them, but there are people who believe something is wrong because it goes against a rule, regardless of the consequences. So there alternative points of view to take into account on that. 

&gt;That's a nice leap you made there with your misrepresentation of what I've said. Occasionally things that cause harm can also have benefits.

I'm having trouble understanding what you're saying here, since it seems to me that ""harm"" and ""benefit"" are opposites. I'm not trying to misrepresent what you're saying, I'm trying to understand what your view is exactly. 

I'm answering your questions as best I can. Please stop it with the accusations against me etc. It hurts my feelings, and I'm trying my best to be honest with you. I've been on the verge of giving up this conversation several times because of the way you've insulted me again and again, while I've tried to be nice. I'm sorry if I've come off condescending etc, I'm not trying to, and that is the limitation of text.

Also sun centred models predicted planetary positions with less accuracy than the Ptolemaic model did. It took some slight tweaks before it was better, and those tweaks took a long time to happen.

Doing next to nothing is just horrible, you have lots of time to think about how pointless it all is.

This might seem like a long enough time to decide but it really wasn't. I would not have signed up for another year if I had know that my job was to warm a chair in an open office and stand to the side of Japanese classes about English (I do occasionally do more, however it's the exception not the rule).

"TwoXChromosomes","t5_2r2jt","I think hardly any of the women in the bottom picture are overweight. But I do agree, I think we should just promote a healthy beauty ideal, which is sadly not the case for most part at the moment. The modern modelling industry is absolutely terrifying when it comes to matters of health, I used to be extremely interested in all that stuff so I would read a lot about it and some of the stuff is simply shocking. For example models eating cotton balls dipped in orange juice just to fill up their stomachs not to feel hungry. Or buying seafood and letting it go off and then eating it a few days before a big fashion show to give themselves food poisoning in order to expel all the ""extra weight"". Or downright dropping dead behind the curtain at a catwalk due to being malnourished. It's scary stuff. 

&gt;""larger women were seen as more attractive people in the old days""

By larger I didn't mean overweight, I meant healthy, curvy women. Even the women who were considered to be beautiful in the second half of the 19th century were still a lot curvier than what the modelling industry looks for today, corsets were just very popular. Basically the ideal look was a tiny waist but curvy everything else.

With me it wasn't a stranger, it was a guy who'd been in my (then) circle of friends for years.  We'd all been at a friend's party and it was time to go home, and he told them he'd escort me home.  Even then I said I'd be fine alone, but he insisted on coming.  At my place, I tried setting him up on the couch, he pulled me down onto him, I said no, he kept at me, and eventually... I gave in.  I know inside I could have been more forthright, or even tried to fight him off (though he was stronger than me - had been in the military), but it was like I just kind of shut down.  I'd had a lot to drink, and I'd spent the night trying to hide my attraction to a girl at the party from my friends (was confused about my bisexuality then)...  But either way, I know I could have stopped him.  Thankfully, there was no intercourse - at least that I know of.  He led me to bed, tried to get me to give him a blow job, and I ended up falling asleep on him.

And I don't want to post this after having written that down, but I will because it's the truth, and I want you OP to know you aren't alone.

"philosophy","t5_2qh5b","&gt; Objectively speaking, of course! Why did whites consider blacks to be of a different status? Partly because they believed that they were genetically flawed or of a different species but we can know, objectively, that this isn't true. Therefore, there was no reason to consider people of different races as having different statuses. 

Okay, I can go along with this.

&gt; No, simply put, the meaning of these words then become trivial.

Not quite sure why that makes them trivial or meaningless.  Would you say that ""tasty"" is meaningless and trivial because it is subjective?  

&gt; That is not my argument at all. The fact is, and if would dispute this I don't know where we can find much common ground, it can be said that the Holocaust was, objectively, an immoral action (on any grounds of objective moral theory).

Well given that I don't agree with objective moral theory, I can't really say.  If you believe that objective morals come from God, for example, then given that God didn't save his ""chosen people"" what possible evidence do we have that God considers this to be morally bad?

&gt; As for the need to reconcile the belief in objective morality with the non-belief in God, I don't see this as a problem at all. Whether or not someone believes in the existence of one or any Gods, that is not a prerequisite for believing in objective morality.

Well it certainly makes it a lot harder to find out what is objectively moral if you don't have a God to tell you.  It's hard to see how you could have any other basis.

&gt;    If the definition of an action as good, bad, moral, immoral is on dependent on the sentiment of the actor, how are those words no longer trivial?

I'm not quite sure what you mean by trivial.  If you mean that all moral questions thus have a straightforward trivial answer, then pretty much yes.  Although there are still plenty of interesting challenges and ethical debates arguing over whether something is logically wrong *given a certain starting moral position*.  And checking that our moral systems are consistent etc.

&gt; If the meaning of wrong and right are dependent on the actor, how are you ever able to criticize the actions of others that you yourself deem immoral?

Because I consider their actions immoral :-)  It should make sense that I would want other people to follow what I consider to be right and wrong.

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","No worries. Typically the more damage you do, the more damage you take. You don't want to fight under towers unless you can tank tower damage. Assassins are typically designed to kill opponents 1v1. Their main threats are burst skills (usually AP based). Since assassins tend to fight in short bursts, autoattacks (and therefore AD), is not usually a significant source of damage (1v1, which is how assassins are supposed to fight). Therefore, they build MR to survive. Assassins are stopped by towers in laning phase and mid-late phase by wards and teammates. This allows opponent tanks or mages to still gain CS, because assassins don't want to push to tower. If MR reduced turret damage, assassins could fight under turrets and dominate early game. 

The tanks argument is pretty straightforward: Tanks build Armor and MR, often equally. They can already tank turret AD damage with *just* their armor. If both Armor and MR both blocked turret damage, you're essentially doubling the amount of turret damage a tank can tank. (i.e. if Rammus had 100 Armor and 100 MR, his effective turret DR would be 200)

He recently started making fake facebook accounts to send emails to her friends, her husbands friends and her husbands employee trying to turn everyone against them with completely false accusations about her husband being a drug dealer. We were able to prove the fake account was him because he was also using it to ""like"" and comment on posts from his stupid facebook business, and the image he had used was a stock photo.     

After we did all this investigating ourselves she took it to the police station crying, because she is scared about what he will do ( he's an ex cop). The cop at the front barely looked at it and shrugged her off, a female officer saw her and looked through all the evidence saw that his style of wording was the same in all the threatening emails and that he had in fact breached the A.V.O.    
Unfortunately he had since moved to sweden because the A.V.O meant he couldn't become a cop again in Australia, so there is still nothing the Australian police can do about it until he tries to return to the country.   So now he is happily sitting somewhere in Sweden using all of his time to send emails and snail mail letter to anyone in my friends life in an attempt to destroy hers.   
It all started with a dispute over $7000 in tax payments from a house that they owned together. ( he didn't want to pay what he owed and took her to court, when the court sided in her favor he went bat shit crazy)  
He has stated in some of the threats that he has friends that are willing to burn down her house while she and her children are sleeping, so she is pretty scared at the moment. I wish there was more we could do! ","1343780983"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","You're right, I wasn't clear.  In context the implication was internal motivation.

If you're externally motivated out of fear for your life or the life of your dog it's not something you want to do, it's something you're *forced* to do.  Nobody is forcing them to take these cars so they aren't comparable situations.  The only motivation they have is internal.  Even if their buddy's say, ""hey man steal this car or you're a bitch"" they aren't being *forced* to do anything.

If a guy robs a bank we know that's wrong.  But if someone stuck a bomb around his neck and said we'll blow your head off if you don't rob this bank we know the person doesn't desire to rob the bank, they desire not to die.

You can argue it's a waste of time and money, but there are countless hours of video tape showing people who stole cars being arrested by police.  Is it illegal to steal?  Yes.  Are police officers paid to arrest people who steal?  Yes.  There's no need to inject what you think about the matter any further because it's a simple equation.  By definition they're being paid to do their job.  Unless your argument is they a) aren't thieves and/or b) the police aren't paid to catch thieves saying it's a waste of money is a dead point.

&gt; real thieves smell the trap

That's interesting because the common thread of most people they catch in bait cars are previous charges for GTA.  The smartest in any profession make up a small fraction, hence why they're labeled elite.  Judging the effectiveness of police work on the smallest fraction of offenders would be more inefficient and a true waste of money and time.","1343780985"

I'll give you an example: when my boyfriend and I first started seeing each other we decided to go out to a strip club. We'd been to strip clubs before but not with each other. The music was pretty loud so we sat close so we could hear each other (which was also quite handy for touching and physical flirting). I thought one of the girls was really cute so I decided, on a whim, I buy my boyfriend a lapdance - but after I got one. I won't go into details but it was a hot lapdance with some boobage action but what was super hot was that my boyfriend and I locked eyes and eyefucked the shit out of each other. Needless to say that lapdance has provided great fuel for our sexual fire.

Also: I earned ""cool chick"" points for buying him a lapdance and having a great time making it rain on the girls.

"berlin","t5_2qt49","I think you'll have no problem finding a place. Take it easy--Berlin is a good city for that. My girlfriend and I have lived in Berlin and visited many times. Here are a couple of sites that we have used with great success: http://www.studenten-wg.de/angebote_lesen.html?fuer=1-Zimmer-Wohnung&amp;stadt=Berlin&amp;PHPSESSID=3715f3cc8c04d0baddb6c70a2ace44e6 (I already selected studio apartments in Berlin for you but you can change the search settings for shared or two room apartments or whatever) and http://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/wohnungen-in-Berlin.8.2.0.0.html (I've already selected Berlin for you here and to have the site in English--they provide this function themselves which is nice and convenient).  
It might take a bit of tinkering and Google page translate function to get the hang of it. Almost anyone you write will know English, and often they will write their ads in both English and German. On both those websites, there is an option called 'Zwischenmiete' or 'intermediate rent only'--make sure and select those. People often sublet in Berlin and you can usually find someone that's leaving for the same period you are staying.  
You can also use Craigslist, although it can be a little bit more shady. 
So, definitely don't sweat it. You can also just find a room people are renting out, and they often are. This is a great way to practice your German :)
Oh, and don't stay stuck on Kreuzberg. Friedrichshain or Mitte or Prenzlauerberg can be great too, and the public transit is excellent. 
So, good luck and have a great time! ","1343780991"

No one saw Day Z coming, and no one could foresee the loose restrictions being such a disaster for a game that needs tight control over what the players can and cannot do.

When a stand alone product is released you will see a lot've these problems dry up. The game will be designed from the base code up to revolve around supporting secure gameplay, and thus all the holes that HAVE to exist now for the other communities who play Arma 2 can then be closed.

I have no long term fears for Day Z, I just wish the mod we were playing on now was a bit more fine tuned, but I understand the reasons why it isn't.","1343780993"

Dont get me wrong my grades are decent and I can run a 1st class PFT, but they wont make me competitive for a slot.  For example, this past year the entire PLC class for my year got cut.  Like they were told ""youre going to OCS this summer"", but then the budget cuts hit and all of them were cut and only 3 dudes got scholarships out of an NROTC battalion of about 200 + and they had an average GPA of 3.7 and PFT scores above 290.

So I would love to be an officer, but it is really just not an option right now.

I went to the recruiter and he gave me a practice ASVAB which I got a 90 on ( a girl that went before me got a 43).  So, I could either wallow in maybes with the OCS thing or go balls deep with the enlisted thing and just realize its going to suck and hopefully get an MOS I enjoy.

And without a case worker keeping tabs on their case, there is NO ONE looking out for those children.

Cataracts are a serious medical issue in North Korea, causing many people to be completely blind. Well this hero-among-men of a surgeon brought some much-needed first world medicine to these people, performing hundreds of cataract removal surgeries over just a few short days. 

They unwrapped everyone's bandages together in a big hall, and amazingly they all had their sight restored. There was a large painting of Kim Jong Il in the front of the room (of course), and one-by-one, they all went in front of it to prostrate themselves, cry, and thank Great Leader for their vision. No one thanked the doctor. 

One young woman even promised Great Leader that she would work twice as hard in his salt mine. 

Yeah, I would say its a lot like God-logic. Exactly like when people thank Him when their lives are saved by EMT's, trauma surgeons, oncologists, etc.

"DebateaCommunist","t5_2t9dp","&gt;The free market ideology is seen as one which most greatly supports the State in virtue of not only their staunch opposition of it but this is also because of the free market's (whether Ron Paul minarchist, or anarcho-capitalist) support of private property (again, are you beginning to see where the EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO CONTROL is violent?), which is precisely why the State exists in the first place (and historically, the two emerged at the same time): to protect private property.

I'm nearly at the point now, where without condoning or condemning, I understand exclusive right to control.

&gt;As such, Ron Paul is someone who sells the free market ideology to unbeknowing teenagers and (white privileged selfish male) youth, allowing for the dogma of oppression, of war, and of violence to spread without them even knowing it. Most people in /r/EPS are radically anti-Capitalism and anti-State for that reason. I would recommend you watch Yes Men Fix the World - it's a really well put together film on this. It paints the picture really nicely, and it's a really funny video. They even interview people at CATO institute and other libertarian think-tanks at one point.

Do you believe that Ron Paul would be knowingly oppressing people with his free market ideology should he won his presidential election? Also, I'm quite curious, why do you capitalize the state? I don't even believe words like that are worthy of recognition in such standards. 

&gt;Mutualists can be communistic, and communists can be mutualistic. But this is not necessarily the case. Some mutualists favor cost as the limit of price, while communists are often anti-economics altogether. The question you're asking about ""how might labour practically function"" is one which many communist responses would be agreed upon by mutualists, because the behavior in many cases is similar (due to the fact that both communists and mutualists would agree that the means of production should not be privately owned).
:) How was your day?

Okay, so Communists and Mutualists are similar. Can you give me a synopsis on the other points I mentioned in the last post? And can you describe the truly defining differences between Communism and Mutualism?

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","Not sure how you feel about spending cash on a ""f2p"" game, but I'd recommend [this deal](http://store.steampowered.com/app/17095/) on Steam.  Its $20 and you get some extra classes and weapons unlocked (the Pathfinder unlocks are pretty boss) as well as a couple perks.  It'd be nice to play around with when first starting.  Mainly it gives you VIP (which you get for spending *any* money on the game at any time) and some gold.  If you like the game, spending the gold on a month booster will substantially speed up your ability to purchase new items (its a temporary 2x modifier that stacks on top of VIP, for a total for 3x over base). 

If not, spending the lowest amount for VIP at least is worth it.  Its certainly not a pay to win game (scrubs may claim otherwise even though the only ""cash only"" items are cosmetics), but without at least the VIP bonus and ideally a boost as well your progress will be a lot slower.  ~15 games for a cheap gun unlock (cheap generally has no bearing on the quality, most of the newer are guns are the cheapest) isn't bad, but 5 games is a lot more fun and exciting.","1343781004"

"Stretched","t5_2tm3i","It's pretty simple, really. Trust your body, it knows then it's ready and when it's not. Once you get to around 2g, don't use tapers any more, use Teflon tape (which can be bought at pretty much any hardware store because it's made for plumbing). Never use any tapes that have any form of adhesive on it because the toxins can fuck your ears up. Not sure how big you want to go, but once you get to around 3/4"" or 1"" you might want to start looking into bondage tape instead, simply because it's much wider so there's more room for you to cut the pieces in a precise way (I noticed that Teflon tape became too thin and didn't cover the wearable surface on my plugs after a while).

Use Jojoba oil to massage your ears with every day, and make sure you wash your ears and plugs every time you shower. After you get to the ""point of no return"", which is like, 7/16"" or something, start taking your plugs out for an hour or two every day. Keep leaving them out for longer and longer intervals over time, to the point where you can leave them out overnight and only lose a size or two (keep smaller plugs handy so that you can put them in first in the morning and let your ears stretch back out to their normal size). This is commonly referred to as letting your ear lobes relax, and once you are able to leave your plugs out over night you will understand why. This technique will eliminate 99.9% of ear cheese without fail and will also promote elasticity in your lobes, which will ease the process of stretching.

Know that only downsizing can make your ear lobes any thicker, and even then it's no miracle solution for shitty lobes. The way people get thin ears is by stretching too fast. You will want to strive to have fat, plump ear lobes that show no signs of blowouts (another sign of stretching too fast).

Don't buy jewelry from any place that calls body jewelry ""gauges"" because that is a telltale sign of ignorance and they will not be able to help you if something seems off with your ears. Gauge is a system of measurement used for wire, it is not a term that is used to describe body jewelry, nor is it a term that is used to describe the process of stretching your ears.

Love your ear lobes and they will love you. And always remember that, when in doubt, downsize and soak your earlobes in sea salt water. It is SO much better to lose a little bit of progress that you've made for like, 2 or 3 weeks than it is to keep going and do irreparable damage to your ears. I've been stretching my ear lobes for 5 years, and have downsized so much, like, I have downsized INCHES over the years. If I added my downsizes to the progress I've already made, my ears would be like, 5""+! A few weeks to a month or so is nothing in the long run c;

Good luck with your stretching, and don't ever let anybody try to dictate to you what you can and can not do to your own body.","1343781011"

"WTF","t5_2qh61","Actually, reddit sort of *is* allergic to content. A post gets propelled up the front page faster if it gets lots of upvotes in a short period of time. It's easier for a short read or a simple image to hit the front page because people can look at it and upvote within 10 seconds, so a new picture might get a dozen upvotes in the first minute. A long article will take a few minutes to read, so even with the same number of upvotes, those votes will be spaced out over more time, and the submission is less likely to rise in rank. Then you take into account that, let's say half of redditors prefer long articles and half of redditors prefer pictures and short content. The long-readers will upvote only a few things in an hour, whereas the short-readers and picture people can upvote a hundred things in an hour, so the front page will be dominated by things with lower content.

TL;DR: Look to smaller subreddits or pages 3+ for submissions with higher content.","1343781020"

What is good about threading, is it pulls the hair from the root when done properly; oftentimes, plucking or waxing can break the hair at the skin level.  If you are sensitive, threading is easier on you skin.  It might feel a bit off at first, but I tend to find it therapeutic.  Threading can also attack individual hairs with more precision than waxing.  Get them done professional first (in whatever method you select) and then do home maintenance in between professional appointments.  I have thick heavy brows naturally, and I pluck every few days and I try to get them threaded every 2 months. ","1343781024"

"truegaming","t5_2sgq6","A lot of people seem to have the problem of trying to chase that first ""high"". I've spent a lot of time in the MMO market trying new stuff. My advice to anyone suffering from this is to try a game very different from the one you started on. Going from Everquest to WoW isn't going to be much of a leap, they're both high fantasy with a common set of rules. Try a Sci-fi game, try some of those thousands of half baked korean MMO's. Try an MMO all about martial arts. 

After spending all the time I have going from MMO to MMO I find that when I go to a new AAA MMO I appreciate it's setting and world so much more than I did when the total number of MMO's I'd played numbered somewhere around 5 or less. 

When I play a new one now I spend much more time in character creation making a cool looking character. I take my time while playing to look around the world and really take it all in. When I finally get to a big city I have to stop and just look at it for awhile and go ""holy shit. *Look* at this place."" I read all the quests and piece together the story of this world in my head.

In short; nothing will ever recapture that feeling I had when I was first playing WoW and discovered that the little island Night Elfs start on *wasn't* the whole game.

Yes, its noob to push the lane and keep it there but its not noob to selectively use it to mess up the enemy's creep control and to hit them with a 200+ nuke at the same time.  The other classic example is mid lane when you use a nuke to make the enemy choose between creep XP or getting the rune. 

Another thing to point out, double clicking the Recall hotkey grabs one of your allies and teleports him to you without having to click on the minimap or a hero portrait.

The build runes and masteries are all depending on the matchup I'm up against.

To carry with ezreal typically you want a kill lane partner, Blitz, Taric, Leona are your best friends. Ezreal's early game is arguably the strongest of all the ADs (I think draven's is crazy good but his kit is lacking)

For runes Run 9.6 damage, and 10 armor pen. This can be achieved with 6 armor pen reds, 3 damage reds, and 3 damage quints. This is optimal between AD and armor pen from runes.

Masteries always get 21 in offense tree, if it's a kill lane bot like graves/corki/leona/taric bottom I'll go 9 into defense, if it's a more passive lane Ashe+janna, go 9 into utility picking up movement speed and extended buffs. Don't go for mana regen.","1343781044"

"AskReddit","t5_2qh1i","I only agree with you slightly.

I'd rephrase gambit87's post to ""Be **wary** of rape/molestation victims"". Patience can go a long way, sure, and making huge generalizations is bad, yes, but it's a very well documented fact that such victims tend to struggle with interpersonal relationships on a very fundamental level, and many have a very slight chance of dealing with these issues without professional help. So it's not an ""over-generalization"", it's a statistical fact. 

Of course it's tragic, but I find it more compassionate to avoid relationships certain people are perhaps not ready for, or will cause them a lot of grief or anxiety, over trying to ""fix"" them and playing the role of boyfriend/amateur psychologist and a willingly allow them to struggle with that difficult relationship.

A lot of people need professional help more than they need a boyfriend/girlfriend.

On a less compassionate note: a lot of people just don't want to have to deal with those kinds of serious issues, and you can't really fault them for that. You'd probably have second thoughts on dating a quadriplegic... why? It's not because they are bad people or it's their fault or anything, it's just that having a relationship with that person has certain implications that you may or may not be interested in dealing with at that point in your life. It's a bummer, and it's sad, but it's life, and in all honesty, you should have the right to choose to NOT DATE people who you know have particular issues (in this case, people who are abuse victims who have not gotten adequate treatment).","1343781044"

I hope that dumb fuck enjoys his moment of glory when his mom is fired.

EDIT: You realize that this type of shit is the reason that /r/atheism has such a crap reputation, right? It's not the belief in God or lack thereof. Just throwing it out there.

EDIT 2: Since I've completely failed to make my point in any post so far, let me be perfectly clear. I couldn't care less if every church in existence burned to the ground tomorrow, if Dawkins were made President, or if everyone in the world lost their faith and turned to science. You do not fuck over your family for any reason, especially when you have no information, only data. 

Pretend that instead of a church, the mother were working at a generic company. OP's friend sneaks in to the book-keeper's room, steals the ledger, looks at it, makes some uneducated conclusions, then posts them in such a way that it embarrasses the company, never even bothering to ask his/her mother about it. How can you see that as anything other than an utter violation of trust? If he'd (I'm just going to assume it's a guy to save time typing) said, ""I stumbled on this, Ma, and it looks pretty bad. I don't want to jump to conclusions, but is this really what it appears to be?"" then I would fully support him. His mother could have explained her view of the situation, told him why the books were that way, or maybe said, ""You know what, yeah, this really is unethical. I'll take it to the board tomorrow."" 

But because it's a church, you're allowing your prejudices to take over, so I'll say again. OP's friend was a piece of shit who should have known better and given his mother the consideration of allowing her to explain, rather than dumping it on Facebook.","1343781045"

"politics","t5_2cneq","Leave it to Fox and Reddit to not understand the laws regarding water.

In states which have prior appropriation-based laws (Colorado and Oregon are two) all of the water which exists in the state is appropriated, and then prioritized, based on who made use of it first.

So, let's say that I start using the Colorado river to irrigate my farm, and I use 50 gallons per year.  If I'm the first person to use that river, my 50 gallons must be guaranteed before anyone else's.  I literally own the first 50 gallons of water that goes down the Colorado river.

So, how does a guy end up in jail for collecting rainwater?  Because that rainwater *would* end up in a river, and thus is already owned by someone else.  In an appropriation system where all of the water (and then some) has already been appropriated, allowing him to take that water would be depriving someone else of that amount of water.  Since the other person's appropriation came first, the defendant here doesn't get to step in and take some water out of the flow of water.

Please do not mistake your ignorance of how the laws regarding water function for villainy on the part of the state.","1343781045"

"teslore","t5_2t5ay","I'd imagine magical based tactics in the Imperial Armies are quite limited. Magical talent is common amongst the Imperials, as it is amongst the Mer, so they would not use casters destructively, they would find the best way to make a few magi provide a big advantage, which as you suggested would be to use them as a support role. I suspect any Mages with an ability for the School of Restoration would be serving as field medics, being able to defend themselves better than an ordinary physician or a priest. I imagine others, especially those with a talent for Alteration would try to strengthen key soldiers, such as standard bearers, or officers, and protect them from blows using shields. In smaller skirmishes I imagine that destruction magic is used, since it would be easier to avoid ones allies, and hit ones enemies, but in larger skirmishes a Mage would not be able to hide behind a fleshy barrier of infantry and do this. I doubt Mages would be mounted personally, the more concetration they can apply to the battle field the better. Although casting from horse back is perfectly possible, it would certainly require concentration to be split between casting and riding, a horse is likely to not act calmly in the middle of a battle. That said though, Illusionists would be able to provide cavalry with the advantage of calmed horses, that would be less likely to bolt, and thus easier to control.

One thing we did know about Imperial Armies is that when the Orcs were a large part of the Empire, they were used as shock troops, because of their talent for wearing heavy plate armour, and love for fighting, something that is ideal for a shock troop who will be at the front, killing as much as possible, and protecting more tactical soldiers like archers and cavalry from the enemies general infantry.

I've mentioned cavalry a few times, and I wonder if the Imperial Legions (as they are properly called, rather than Armies) actually have a cavalry. There were no horses what so ever in Morrowind, so I'd personally take that with a pinch of salt, as to whether or not the legions have cavalry, but sadly they are one of the few times we see a lot of the Legions rather than the Guard. In Oblivion we see the *Imperial Guard* (rather than Legions) riding Horses when patrolling outside of cities, but not in enough of an organized way to be considered a cavalry, and in Skyrim we see General Tullius on a Horse at the beginning of the game, again, no clear indication of a Cavalry, but throughout the games I've seen no evidence of a cavalry beyond the mounted Imperial Guards. The Civil War was not a good time to use cavalry, so I understand why it would not be in Skyrim, as the Stormcloaks use of guerilla warfare would put cavalry in a bad position, and the fighting inside cities is not going to be benefited by Horse Back. If anyone has any insight towards this please tell me, I'm genuinely curious now, I've sadly not read Greg Keyes books yet, nor have I read every in-game book, so there are gaps in my knowledge.

One final note, before I'm all out of topics as Imperial Legion structure and tactics are not my strong point, is in regards to you mentioning Rank Structure in your title. In Morrowind you could play as part of the Imperial Legions and ascend through the ranks. These are the ranks, in ascending order:

- Recruit

- Spearmen 

- Trooper 

- Agent

- Champion

- Knight Errant

- Knight Bachelor

- Knight Protector

- Knight of the Garland

- Knight of the Imperial Dragon

The ranks may vary depending on which legion you join, or which province you enlist in, but those are the ranks for Vardenfells Legions. We know Legates, Dragoons and General(s?) are ranks, though unavailable to the PC in Morrowind.

Sorry, I realise this is a very gameplay experience orientated post, I lack other sources of knowledge in regards to Imperial Legions.
[
Here's the relevant UESP page, which may provide some more information.](http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Imperial_Legion)

Edit: As Ralphlizard suggested, between the Oblivion Crisis and Fourth Era Skyrim a lot may have changed, for one Orismer are probably a lesser part of the armies, as well as other provinces which potentially made up parts of the Legions. Also Tactics will have changed, to match the enemy, the Thalmor are strong mages, and require strong protective wards to be defeated, whilst the Stormcloak are barbarians (by class archetype) primarily, and require outwitting to be defeated without losses.","1343781045"

I think the increasingly improved production value of the series has done a lot for the RPG genre as a whole. Each entry has had a lasting influence in it's own way, and every new feature of a game's presentation has only made it's delivery carry that much more impact. Voice acting is absolutely no exception.

"politics","t5_2cneq","&gt;Trying to think of another period in American history were we fight in expensive and wasteful wars, government guaranteed loans create a housing bubble(and now currently a student loan bubble) that pops and causes Americans to loose their homes while simultaneously bailing out the people who were responsible for it (instead of the Americans who couldn't make the payments). Prohibition leads to us having more people in prison than anywhere else on the planet.

No system is perfect. That's part of my point. Yes those are all horrible but while they all have a bit of a history of being caused by corporations they were all also caused by out side factors; fear and misreading of the available data. If you look at quality of life and equality we are much much better off then we were 100 years ago. 

&gt;Government intervention has only led to corporations becoming more powerful and thus the current state which I just described.

No. The constant dropping of regulation after regulation while making changes based on outside money has allowed corporations to have their cake and eat it too over the last few decades. In the past trusts were busted and the people protected. I agree that some regulations are bad and the result of payed off politicians but saying the govt should do nothing is throwing the baby out with the bath water.

What I would really like to see is 

1) better regulation of the political process to stop much of the influence that money has in politics. This is possibly a moot point with most information sharing being free on the net these days. 

2) Patent reform to prevent corporations form doing many of the nasty things they have been doing lately.

That page, while it looks very interesting, is way to long for me to read and digest in time for it to be relevant to this conversation. What is your point in posting it?

Edit: I just realized you may have misunderstood what I meant by 'laws' in what you quoted from me. I don't mean laws of the US. I mean rules that you must follow to do business with someone. If a corporation is a monopoly or something similar like the RIAA they get to choose everything that happens in their industry. History is filled with cases of technology that was suppressed by a company because they did not want a new better technology to eat away at their bottom line. The book ""The Master Switch"" covers many of these cases including many cases of the govt acting as a corporate enforcer. ","1343781047"

"Music","t5_2qh1u","I'm wagering that the Oatmeal is vilifying the largest record companies, and not independent companies. A lot of smaller record companies do care about the music they are putting out, and their consumers. They are helpful in promoting.

I'm not sure what you were expecting from a web comic? The intricacies of the music industry being explained in 4 panels?

I honestly have no sympathy for any label or distributor who pays RIAA dues and gives these people money to advocate out of date copyright laws, filing lawsuits against parents of minors who download music. They fully utilize scare tactics and extortion. 

http://money.cnn.com/2012/01/05/technology/digital_music_sales/index.htm

2012 was the first year where digital music sales eclipsed physical music sales. Pressing and distribution is one of the most expensive parts of creating an album. High album costs were semi-justified with the technology required to create CDs. We're now 20+ years later and prices have barely decreased. 

Take this New York Times article from 1995 

http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/05/arts/pennies-that-add-up-to-16.98-why-cd-s-cost-so-much.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm

In $1995 the cost to manufacture and package a CD wa $2-3. Yet prices were hovering around $15-20. 

15 years later production is even cheaper and we've seen a decrease to what? $14 dollars?

Add to the fact that digital is increasingly becoming the dominant format. The costs incurred on the label leans less towards manufacturing and distribution. The costs then shift towards recording, mixing and mastering which are less expensive. Yet there is still a price increase of over 500% to the consumers. 

You're right that people download because its free. They download because they don't give a shit anymore, which is justifiable given how major record companies and the RIAA have willfully taken advantage of consumers for the past few decades. 

Technology is circumventing the need for them. The desperate attempts of middlemen clinging onto an outdated business model. Absolutely doing everything they can to fight affordable distribution models has only turned the public against them. We're at a point were our technology has created tools for musicians to utilize themselves, selling directly to customers and increasing their own profits instead of having to sell their master recordings to record labels and only getting 10-15% of the revenue. 

I'm not even going to touch on how the RIAA was one of the largest supporters of SOPA and what a clusterfuck that legislation was. Yet the RIAA (all the labels who are members) were willing to censor the internet (and free speech by extension) just to try and keep their outrageous profit streams going.

I'll fully support independent labels. But I'll have no sympathy anytime a member label of the RIAA gets their product torrented. 

For anyone who does care. Heres a handy list on the RIAA's website of which labels and distributors are members.

"math","t5_2qh0n","Wow, that's not a very effective rebuttal.

&gt;Does anyone know what that formula ((x² + y²)² = (x² – y²)² + (2xy)²) is? Because it’s actually pretty amazing. It’s Euclid’s formula for generating Pythagorean triples (like 3,4,5 and 5,12,13) — it even resembles the Pythagorean Theorem, c² = a² + b² — and it can be very useful if you’re studying Geometry.

Soooo... I will need this math formula in order to... study more math.  Ooookey-dokey.  Got it.

First of all, I'm a practicing engineer, and I've never seen that formula in my life, much less needed it.  I assume a ""Pythagorean triple"" is a 3-tuple that satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.  Nice, but when *exactly* do I need that particular formula for 'generating' them?  Students have a right to ask, and they have a right to call bullshit when the answer isn't any better than the one provided by the author.

Second, K-12 classroom time is *valuable*.  No one seems to appreciate that simple truth.  We already waste hundreds of student-hours of classroom time teaching demonstrably worthless skills like penmanship.  We certainly need to keep teaching math... but we simply do not have the luxury of force-feeding knowledge to bored high schoolers that even electrical engineers aren't likely to use.   ""Pretty amazing"" isn't good enough.  The math we teach needs to be the sort of math that makes kids harder for bankers, politicians, CEOs, union organizers, journalists, priests, and even the occasional dishonest scientist to fool.  

I like the idea, promoted in the TED video mentioned by the author, of deprecating calculus and analytic geometry in favor of mandatory coverage of statistics and probability.  If we had classrooms full of engaged students with all the time in the world to learn, then yes, we should cover it all.  But we don't.  It's goofy to think that we somehow magically have the best of all possible mathematics curricula in place today.  ","1343781050"

Please show me where on the PETA website or in any of their literature that they don't gently suggest that people consider trying a vegetarian and/or vegan diet.

"offmychest","t5_2ranw","""Didn't know how to say no""

Pretty simple actually.  Its two letters.  One syllable.  Repeat as often as necessary.  Or don't, and just call the person who didn't read your mind a rapist later on to make yourself feel better.

Now getting you drunk and stoned and taking advantage?  That's plausible, but if he 'raped' you so much, and you broke up with him, why did you go and get drunk and stoned with him?   Why would you place yourself in a pliable state with someone who used 'coercion'?

""Didn't know how to say no"" is bullshit.  You say no and get up and leave.  You don't play coy and tolerate a guy taking your pants off if you don't want to have sex.  There's no ""I didn't know"".  You did know, and you did nothing to stop it, and you regret it.  That doesn't make him a rapist.

One of two things happened here.  Either you play stupid games that allow you to deny any responsibility by playing coy with guys, or you repeatedly went out with a guy who 'raped' you.  Either way, it sounds like you're both scum.

The problem of avoiding the internet for a while is, that you can more easily relapse when you go back to using the internet. In my teens I was at a youth camp. It was impossible to fap, because I had to sleep with 7 others guys in a tent. I didn't missed masturbation, but when I got back home after two weeks I relapsed so hard in my old habits, and masturbated like before.

To get over the one week mark I only installed the enhancement suite and turned the NSFW filter on. The rest was an avoiding tactic: You stand up when an urge appears do pushups, go for a walk outside or only leave the room with the pc for a few minutes. Your willpower will get stronger. At the beginning of the challenge I had to stand up by every fucking urge and go trough the house, talk to my parents or go out for a walk with my dog. Now after 3 weeks when a hard urge appears I only say NO to myself and keep going with the thing that I did when the urge appears. 
But of course you should cut senseless internet use, and rather go out do some sports, meet friends and have some fun in what ever you have fun, except fapping of course ;)

"todayilearned","t5_2qqjc","Actually that is exactly what it means. If they are written decades and decades afterwards they aren't contemporary. That's almost the very definition of non contemporary. As far as the Authors being there, you don't know that because you don't know who the authors are, they are anonymous. Those names were assigned by the church to lend credibility. Also, their claims vary wildly, so much so that it discredits them. Reporters write about events hours, days or even weeks later. Not decades. They also provide sources, photos and other evidence of it's veracity. The authors of the gospels didn't haven any of that or even a reasonable approximation of those, oh and they wrote it 6 DECADES LATER. 

The article I sent you isn't Jesus not existing, it's about huge contradictions between the stories, which you claim are eyewitness accounts, so those errors shouldn't exist. Conservatives and Liberals? What, those aren't even remotely alike. An opinion piece on someone isn't equivalent to the retelling of events. Now you are just grasping at straws. Saying Clinton was a good president and someone else disagreeing is totally different from two people saying a man came back from the dead and then saying how many people were there to great him. I'm not arguing with what people saw him as, but if people from other cultures during his time, and people with in his own culture write about him he more than likely exist. Jesus doesn't have any of that. Sorry you can't accept the evidence.

The Egyptians write about Caesar as well as his other enemies. Contemporaneous writings in his own culture mention him, Jesus doesn't have any of that. Not one. You are confusing what people think about someone and writing about it as credibility of a persons existence, with writing about a person at all and the events surrounding their life. Caesar has all of that, Jesus has none.

The reason I sent you the last article is mainly for the bible quotes themselves, it is contradictory. Jesus's genealogy, how many people were there amongst numerous other things. A simple google search will show you the contradictions, along with how those coveted scholars admit that the gospels aren't eyewitness accounts, that they were written decades after the fact and that they've been changed since then. 

In all likely hood, Jesus didn't exist. He is probably based upon many different people both real and fictional. There are no eyewitness accounts, if there were others would have written about it. But you don't hear anything about till 60+ years afterwards. ","1343781060"

"atheism","t5_2qh2p","Unwin's work involved very weak correlations, and is unconvincing for that very reason. Two things occurring together does not mean one directly causes the other.

He could have interpreted it entirely backwards - it could be that prosperity increases the chances of monogamous relationships, and a crumbling empire causes widespread social issues. So it's entirely possible that monogamy doesn't increase the health of a society, but that a healthy society increases the chances of monogamy. Or the two things could both be caused by another factor. Hypertension and joint problems often occur together, not because one causes the other, but because both are caused by obesity. Who's to say that the same political decisions which destroy empires don't also cause problems with monogamy?

For a more potent example:

Evangelical, fundamentalist Christians have the highest rates of divorce, while atheists have the lowest. Does that mean Christianity *causes* divorce? Could it be that people who are drawn to Christianity also have personality traits which increase the chances of divorce, making it a coincidence? Atheists also wait longer to get married and more avoid marriage altogether, so is it just that atheists are more likely to wait until they find the right person and those who know they won't do well in a marriage avoid it, and that's why they have fewer divorces? It's impossible to break down such complex issues to a simple strict causal relationship, just like monogamy = success is ridiculously oversimplified and impossible to prove.

Unwin also studied empires and other Imperialist nations, with a big part of the definition of ""thriving"" being expansion. So how does that have any relation to modern societies?

The other statements are standard. The incest/polygamy argument, the ""best home environment"" argument which was shredded by studies which show that gay couples raise very well-adjusted adults, and the meaningless ""Bible dun says so"" arguments which I simply do not care about.","1343781061"

I'm even nice here, but no matter what I say it's seen as whatever vile garbage everyone expects. I made a fucking joke, because I thought you could handle that. At about the same time, I made a joke with Raticate and my first response was some random person telling me off for being hateful. I made a joke. To a friend. 

He even joked when he got the message that seeing it in his inbox he wondered just how many downvotes it would have. And you know, that's the thing. Everyone wants to just fucking downvote me, and seeing those little negative numbers next to my name makes everyone think I'm being an asshole.

It's not that I'm nice everywhere else, it's that I'm just not a fucking monster, but you and everyone else here seems to think I am. Fuck, I'm one of the reasons this place exists, according to some people, me being one of the loudiest, bitchiest people against Laurelai, but no, I'm seen as a fucking pariah because I don't go &lt;&lt; HUG &gt;&gt; to every post. At this point, what's the point in posting anything that isn't snarky? Any advice I give is just going to get downvoted to hell anyway.

"atheism","t5_2qh2p"," I've tried, honestly, to clarify this but get shouted down.

The masses seem to think that any expression of the form ""X is not a true Y"" is a fallacy.  It's not.  Trivial example: Koala bears are not true bears.  King cobras are not true cobras because they're not of the specific genealogical family identified as ""true cobras"".

If you have a working definition of X such that false X's can be identified without altering the definition, then you are not making a NTS fallacy.  You may be *wrong*, but it's not a fallacy.  

For example: ""No true basketballs have black stripes"" is not a fallacy.

When someone shows you a basketball with black stripes, you say ""That is not a basketball, because it has black stripes"", you are not committing a fallacy.  You're just *wrong*.  Your definition has remained consistent, you applied it consistently, and gave an answer consistent with your initial statement.

The fallacy is:

1) No basketballs have black stripes.    
2) Oh really? Here's a basketball with black stripes.   
1) Well, no *true* basketball has black stripes.    

It's a fallacy because and only because the definition of ""basketball"" was changed in a way that allowed (1) to believe he had been right all along.  *THAT* and only that, is the NTS fallacy.  The third statement is inconsistent because it uses a different definition than the first.

If there is no definition-shift (implied or explicit) *there is no NTS fallacy*.  You're just wrong.","1343781078"

I have never had to experience something like that before and can't imagine what you have had to go through. Never having undergone something like this, I can not say that the advice I have for you is the best or that it will necessarily work. However, it sounds like you started to shut off emotionally immediately after her death and did not allow yourself the opportunity to mourn (I know that sounds cliche!). I would recommend maybe talking to someone else that knew her (a mutual friend or a family member of hers?) about what you miss about her or maybe reminisce over some memories just to get a feeling of closure. You do not have to mentally punish yourself or make yourself feel guilty every time you think of her or miss her, that's not what she would want. And I don't think telling the girls you see intimately of your experience is a bad idea. If you could see a future (not like marriage, but of a serious relationship) with one of these girls, you owe it to her to tell her about this.

"gifs","t5_2qt55","No, it doesn't. The common assumption on many/most sites (including reddit) is that you're male (this was posted on /b/ for fuck's sake). 

Take that fucking image that still does the rounds (though not so much as it did a few months back) purporting to show how men and women take pictures. The panel showing an object photographed by a guy just has the object; the picture taken by a woman shows her with her head in frame. Because women can't help but put themselves in any picture! Laughter ensues. 

Aside from the fact that the assertion is flat-out untrue, the cartoon assumed that if there's no indication of who took the picture, *it* *must* *have* *been* *a* *man*.

On a different (not horrible) note, I've noticed that a standard compliment from one poster to another is ""good sir"". It's worth noting that the assumption is that whoever's being complimented is male - I've seen ""good lady"" or some female variant fewer than 10 times. ","1343781079"

"leagueoflegends","t5_2rfxx","Nunu is godlike in premades/ranked play.  Assessing his pros and cons...

Pros:

* One of the best counter junglers right now (in denying jungle creeps/buffs from the enemy)
* Able to give up buffs early game for other lanes who need it.  Because of his E, his passive, and lesser jungle camps giving mana now, nunu doesn't really need Red or Blue to gank early on.  If you do want Blue or Red, just take it from the enemy jungle.
* Ganks are really brutal
* Able to secure or steal baron/dragon really well with consume and smite.
* Ultimate and E wrecks hard early game in teamfights and hurts the enemy AD carry hard late game 
* Very fast clear time as a jungler.  

Cons:

* Only has two sources of damage outside of auto attacks, his ultimate not being very reliable unless you have good positioning 
* Falls off late game in terms of damage 
* If lee sin or anyone else with great dueling potential comes into your jungle, let's hope your teammates are smart enough to help you.

Concluding remarks:  

Although nunu isn't exactly the the type of jungler that does a lot of damage upfront like nocturne or lee sin, his strength lies within his great presence early game to fuck with the enemy jungle and help your team snowball hard with great ganks and early red/blue buffs.  By doing this early game you've done what junglers are supposed to do, which is help your team get a huge early game advantage and set the enemy team further behind.  If your team thinks that nunu is a terrible jungler just because the lack of his damage output, but you've done all of the above to put your team above others, then maybe you should look for new people to play with.

"guns","t5_2qhc8","You did ask for opinions on a decision and we gave them. If you want stats, facts, figures, and professional reviews then you should head to google and do a search.  

I found my PPQ on consignment at a LGS lightly used. I put 100 rounds of Federal range ammo and half a box of hollow points.  The trigger was absolutely fantastic. To be honest, the trigger is smooth enough that I am a bit hesitant to carry it for now. It is my first pistol without a dedicated safety and I'm not yet comfortable with it.  Looking back, the P99 might have been better for me.  Either way, both guns felt more comfortable in my hand than any Glock I've held. 

I am absolutely thrilled every time I get out to the range. The small back straps fit my hands perfectly while still providing enough area for a solid grip. The grip is perfectly angled for a comfortable, consistent, and stable hold.  On that note, I'm a huge fan of the mag release. The levers are much easier for me to hit than the 'for big hands only' thumb placement most guns use. 

I'd recommend considering a swap of the sights if you plan to carry or use for home defense. The stock sites are good in daylight but some good night sights would be great.  

Overall, I'm thrilled to own the PPQ and would recommend it to others.  ","1343781081"
